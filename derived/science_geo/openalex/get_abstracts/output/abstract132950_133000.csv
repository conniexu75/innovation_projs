Percoll-purified rat liver mitochondria exhibited a negligible contamination with other subcellular fractions (1–4%) and high degree of functionality (respiratory control ratio = 5–6). Toluene-permeabilized mitochondria, mitochondrial homogenates, and a crude preparation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) incubated with the spin trapN-methyl-d-glucamine-dithiocarbamate-FeIIproduced a signal ascribed to the NO⋅ spin adduct (g = 2.04; a N = 12.5 G). The intensity of the signal increased with time, protein concentration, andl-Arg, and decreased with the addition of the NOS inhibitorN G-monomethyl-l-arginine. Intact mitochondria, mitochondrial homogenates, and submitochondrial particles produced NO⋅ (followed by the oxidation of oxymyoglobin) at rates of 1.4, 4.9, and 7.1 nmol NO⋅ × (min·mg protein)−1, respectively, with aK m for l-Arg of 5–7 μm. Comparison of the rates of NO⋅ production obtained with homogenates and submitochondrial particles indicated that most of the enzymatic activity was localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane. This study demonstrates that mitochondria are a source of NO⋅, the production of which may effect energy metabolism, O2consumption, and O2 free radical formation.

Because of its effect on neurotransmission, vasodilation, and immune response (1Moncada S. Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M. Biochem.

Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar), NO⋅ plays an important role in physiology, pathology, and pharmacology. Studies with brain tissue and macrophage lysates have shown that NOS is localized exclusively in the soluble fraction (3Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar, 4Marletta M.A. Yoon P.S. Iyengar R. Leaf C.D. Wishnock J.S.

Commun. 1989; 165: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and recent studies have indicated that the majority (>80%) of bovine endothelial NOS activity is bound to the particulate fraction of cell homogenates (7Förstermann U.

Because the particulate fraction used in the studies was expected to contain plasma membranes, as well as microsomes, and, possibly, intracellular organelles, the actual subcellular location of the activity remained to be determined. Other lines of evidence have indicated the presence of NOS in the perinuclear region, in discrete regions of the plasma membrane of cultured endothelial cells, and in intact blood vessels (9Liu J. Garcı́a-Cardena G. Sessa W.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12333-12340Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Garcı́a-Cardena G. Oh P. Liu J. Schnitzer J.E. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar); immunocytochemical studies have revealed the presence of a NOS, or an antigenically related protein, in mitochondria isolated from different tissues (11Bates T.E. Loesch A. Burnstock G. Clark J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 896-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 12Bates T.E. Loesch A. Burnstock G. Clark J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1995; 211: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The predominant association of this mtNOS with the mitochondrial membrane (11Bates T.E. Loesch A. Burnstock G. Clark J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 896-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 12Bates T.E. Loesch A. Burnstock G. Clark J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and its co-localization with succinate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial marker of the inner membrane (13Kobzik L. Stringer B. Ballingand J.-L. Reid M.B. Stamler J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), suggested that this enzyme has a particulate localization. These studies as well as the presence of substrates and cofactors in mitochondria required for NOS activity such as l-arginine (l-Arg), l-Arg transporters, Ca2+, calmodulin, NADPH, and the availability of O2, led us to postulate mitochondria as a potential source of NO⋅production. Following the use of a specific spin-trapping agent and the controlled oxidation of oxymyoglobin, NO⋅ production was detected in purified mitochondrial preparations (intact mitochondria, permeabilized mitochondria, mitochondrial homogenates, and submitochondrial particles) and crude preparations of NOS (crude fraction) obtained from rat liver. Given the important implication of a mitochondrial production of NO⋅ for energy conservation mechanisms and free radical production, such production may serve as the basis for a new understanding of biochemical regulation, based on the ubiquitous distribution of mitochondria and the diffusibility of NO⋅through cellular membranes. EDTA, EGTA, sodium succinate, sodium malate, sodium glutamate, mannitol, ADP, sucrose, HEPES, bovine serum albumin (fatty-acid free), and CHAPS were purchased from Sigma. Catalase, horseradish peroxidase (grade I), and superoxide dismutase were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The spin trap,N-methyl-d-glucamine-dithiocarbamate-FeII(MGD), was purchased from the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (Oklahoma City, OK). 4-Hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO or TEMPOL) was obtained from Aldrich. Oxymyoglobin was prepared from 1 mm of commercially available horse heart myoglobin in 0.1 m Hepes buffer, pH 7.4 (degassed with helium), mixed with a slight molar excess of sodium dithionite. The sample was aerated, and excess dithionite was removed by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-25 column (14Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liver mitochondria were isolated from adult Wistar rats (180–200 g) by differential centrifugation, essentially as described in Ref. 15Chance, B., Hagihara, B., Proceedings of the Fifth International Congress of Biochemistry Moscow, Sissakian, A. N. M., 5, 1963, 3, 37, Pergamon Press, New York.Google Scholar. The livers from rats (anesthetized with pentobarbital or decapitated) were excised, washed with 0.25 m sucrose, and homogenized (1/10, w/v) using MSHE (0.22 m mannitol, 0.07m sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fatty-acid free), 2 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min in a JA-17 rotor. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,300 × g for 10 min. Intact, purified mitochondria were isolated using Percoll to remove contaminating organelles and broken mitochondria (16Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Percoll was selected as the gradient medium because of its negligible osmolarity and chemical inertness (17Pertoft H. Laurent T.C. Låås T. Kågedal L. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 88: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Reinhart P.H. Taylor W.M. Bygrave F. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The pellet (mitochondrial fraction) was resuspended in 5 ml of MSHE supplemented with 20 ml of 30% Percoll in 225 mm mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fatty-acid free). This solution was spun at 95,000 ×g in a Beckman Ti60 rotor for 30 min. The fraction with a density of 1.052–1.075 g/ml was collected and washed twice with MSHE at 6,300 × g for 10 min to remove the Percoll. Purified mitochondria were washed twice with 150 mm KCl, followed by two washings with MSHE. Permeabilized mitochondria were prepared using a controlled treatment of purified mitochondria with toluene (19Rutter G.A. Midgley P.J.N. Denton R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1014: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were resuspended to 20 mg of protein/ml in MSHE supplemented with 8.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 at 0–4 °C. Toluene (0.2%, v/v) was added to the suspension, which was gently inverted every 15–30 s over a 2-min period. Mitochondria were then pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed by aspiration. Mitochondria were washed twice, and resuspended, in MSHE containing polyethylene glycol. Submitochondrial particles (SMP) were obtained by sonication (20Cadenas E. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) of purified mitochondria and stored at −20 °C at a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. Mitochondrial homogenates were obtained by mechanical homogenization of the mitochondrial fraction subjected to three cycles of freeze-thawing. A crude fraction of NOS was obtained from purified rat liver mitochondria. Mitochondria from two to four livers were homogenized with Buffer A (1 mmEDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). This homogenate was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 0–4 °C. The mitochondrial membranes were washed with Buffer B (Buffer A plus 1 m KCl, 10% glycerol) and centrifuged at the same speed for 30 min. The pellet was treated with Buffer A plus 20 mm CHAPS at 4 °C under continuous stirring. After 30 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. This supernatant, concentrated in a Centricon™ cartridge (M r cut-off of 30,000; Amicon, Danvers, MA), was referred to as crude fraction (150,000 × gsupernatant). Aliquots of the samples, containing the NO⋅ spin trap MGD (21Kotake Y. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 222-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kotake Y. Tanigawa T. Tanigawa M. Ueno I. Allen D.R. Lai C.-S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), were transferred to bottom-sealed Pasteur pipettes, and the spectra were recorded at 22 °C with an X-band EPR spectrometer, operating at 9.77 GHz. Instrument settings are described in the legend for Fig. 1. The settings were selected using either sodium nitroferricyanide or nitrosoglutathione as NO⋅-releasing agents. The oxidation of oxymyoglobin (23Doyle M.P Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1981; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) was followed at 581–592 nm (ε581–592= 11.6 mm−1 cm−1) with a double-beam spectrophotometer Hitachi U-3110 with a multiple wavelength program at 22 °C using 50 μm oxymyoglobin. Superoxide dismutase (1 μm) and catalase (1 μm) were added to prevent interference by O·̄2 and H2O2, respectively, that might be produced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain or by autoxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin, heme, or flavin semiquinones. The reaction medium used with SMP, mitochondrial homogenates, or crude fraction consisted of 1 mml-Arg, 1 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm NADPH, and 12 μm tetrahydrobiopterin in 0.1 m Hepes buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction medium used with intact mitochondria consisted of 10 mm succinate, 225 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 50 μm oxymyoglobin, and 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4. The reaction medium used with permeabilized mitochondria consisted of 225 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 mm NADPH, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 μm reduced tetrahydrobiopterin, 20 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.4, plus 8.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. Protein was determined by the Lowry assay (24Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.H. Farr A.L. Randall J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. All assays were done in duplicate and were repeated five to eight times in separate experiments using 2–4 rats/experiment. Data are presented as mean ± S.E., in which the S.E. were between 10 and 12% of the mean values. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation (15Chance, B., Hagihara, B., Proceedings of the Fifth International Congress of Biochemistry Moscow, Sissakian, A. N. M., 5, 1963, 3, 37, Pergamon Press, New York.Google Scholar), purified by Percoll centrifugation (16Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and washed with high ionic strength solutions. This procedure allowed the efficient removal of contaminating organelles, broken mitochondria, arginase (25Cheung C.-W. Raijman L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and adsorption artifacts, yielding a highly purified preparation. This is supported by the low degree of non-mitochondrial contamination (1–4%; Table I), which was comparable with, and in some cases less than, that obtained with other purification procedures (18Reinhart P.H. Taylor W.M. Bygrave F. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Bustamante E. Soper J.W. Pedersen P.L. Anal.

Mitochondria isolated using this procedure differ from those obtained by differential centrifugation in that the former exhibited a higher respiratory control ratio, indicating functional integrity and membrane intactness (Table II).Table IEnzymatic characterization of isolated rat liver mitochondriaEnzymeLocationSpecific activityRatioRecoveryHomogenateMitochondria%Cytochrome oxidaseMitochondria82.5495618Glucose-6-phosphataseMicrosomes35 70.20.65′-NucleotidasePlasma membrane42 170.41.2Acid phosphataseLysosomes771001.33.9CatalasePeroxisomes350 20.61.8 Open table in a new tab Table IIComparison of mitochondrial functional parametersIsolation procedurePercoll centrifugationDifferential centrifugationState 3 (ng-atoms O/min/mg protein)133 ± 1044 ± 2State 4 (ng-atoms O/min/mg protein)21 ± 218 ± 1RCR Malate-glutamate4.5 ± 0.5ND Succinate5.9 ± 0.53.8 ± 0.5P/O Malate-glutamate2.8 ± 0.1ND Succinate1.8 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Toluene-treated mitochondria with an increased permeability for the spin trap and external NADPH were incubated with the spin trap ((MGD)2/FeII) for 1 h at room temperature. A weak EPR signal consisting of a triplet (a N = 12.5 G; g iso= 2.04; intensity ratio 1:1:1; Fig. 1 A) was assigned to the (MGD)2/FeII-NO⋅ complex (21Kotake Y. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 222-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kotake Y. Tanigawa T. Tanigawa M. Ueno I. Allen D.R. Lai C.-S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) by comparison with the signal obtained with the NO⋅ donor, nitrosoglutathione (Fig. 1 E). In addition to the triplet, a line from a quartet signal was present assigned to the (MGD)2/CuII complex produced by the reaction of free CuII, in the homogenate or in the reaction solution, with the excess of MGD. The addition of l-Arg increased the signal by 30% (Fig. 1 B), whereasN G-monomethylarginine (NMMA), the competitive inhibitor of NOS (30Marletta M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 488-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), decreased the signal by 50% (Fig. 1 C) and 20% (Fig. 1 D) in the absence and presence of l-Arg, respectively. Based on its sensitivity to NMMA, the formation of the (MGD)2/FeII-NO⋅ signal in the biological sample without l-Arg suggests an endogenous pool of Arg capable of sustaining NO⋅ production through an NOS-catalyzed reaction (Fig. 1 C). The NMMA-insensitive EPR signal suggested the presence of a labile pool of NO⋅. 2C. Giulivi, unpublished observations. Of note, the addition of 5 μg/ml calmodulin and/or 1 mmCa2+ did not significantly affect the signal intensity, indicating that NOS was fully active with the cofactors present in our preparations. Toluene-treated rat liver mitochondria, incubated with the spin trap for 8 h to increase the substrate and inhibitor concentrations in the mitochondrial matrix, exhibited signal intensities 2.3- and 2.7-fold higher than those found at 1 h, with and withoutl-Arg addition, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Preincubation of mitochondria with NMMA inhibited the signal formation by 50% and 15% in the absence and presence of l-Arg, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). A weak (MGD)2/FeII-NO⋅ signal was also noted in the absence of mitochondrial homogenate (data not shown); this signal is likely to originate from NO⋅ diffusion from ambient air (about 0.1 ppm). Mitochondrial homogenates or a crude fraction of NOS incubated for 1 h with l-Arg and the spin trap showed the same three-line EPR spectrum observed with toluene-permeabilized mitochondria (Table III). The EPR signal intensities obtained with crude fraction were 5–7-fold higher than those observed with permeabilized mitochondria. The signal intensities were increased by l-Arg supplementation and decreased by NMMA addition to different extents, depending on the specific biological preparation (Table III). Similar results were obtained usingl-N 5-(1-iminoethyl)ornithine (NIO), another NOS inhibitor (data not shown). The high concentrations of NMMA required in these experiments are indicative of the competitive kinetics of the inhibition of NOS by NMMA in the presence of an endogenous pool of l-Arg, the latter most likely sustained by proteolytic activities present in the samples.Table IIIEPR signal intensities of the (MGD)2FeIINO· for different mitochondrial preparationsAdditionsToluene-treated mitochondriaHomogenate (1 h)Crude fraction (1 h)1 h8 hNone1.02.30.74.98l-Arg1.303.51.009.75NMMA0.51.20.42.0l-Arg + NMMA1.053.00.7 (0.5)4.9 (2.34) Open table in a new tab The iron-nitrosyl complex signal intensities obtained with toluene-treated rat liver mitochondria after 1 h of incubation showed a linear dependence on protein concentration. Double integration of the EPR signals and interpolation of calibration curves of the area of the low-field peak versus TEMPO or TEMPOL allowed the quantification of the EPR signals. This quantification permitted the calculation of an NO⋅ production rate of 48 ± 2 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein (r = 0.99). The NO⋅experimentally detected by EPR accounted for approximately 16% of the rate of metmyoglobin formation, even when an excess of spin trap was used. This underestimation may be due to the metabolism of the spin trap by mitochondrial preparations to EPR silent species, probably of the type (MGD)2FeII-NO⋅-X, where X = halogen ions or NO2, as has been described for diethyldithiocarbamate (31Büttner H. Feltham R.D. Inorg. Chem. 1972; 11: 971-976Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Ileperuma O.A. Feltham R.D. Inorg. Chem. 1977; 16: 1876-1883Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This notion is strengthened by the similar recovery (12%) of an EPR signal of a synthetic iron-nitrosyl complex (formed by incubating sodium nitroprusside, an NO⋅ donor, and the spin trap) and the decrease in the signal intensities with protein concentrations above 12 mg. The production of NO⋅ in the presence ofl-Arg was measured in intact mitochondria, mitochondrial homogenates, and submitochondrial particles by following the NMMA-sensitive oxidation of oxymyoglobin to metmyoglobin (Fig. 3). The NMMA-insensitive rates of oxymyoglobin oxidation were 10–20% of the total rate of metmyoglobin formation using mitochondria and mitochondrial homogenates, and 30% when using SMP. The higher unspecific oxidation in the latter instances may be attributed to a direct oxidation of oxymyoglobin by a component of the respiratory chain. 3C. Giulivi and E. Cadenas, unpublished observations. The rates of NO⋅ production increased linearly with the protein concentration of mitochondrial preparations (Fig. 3). The specific rates were 1.36, 4.9, and 7.1 nmol × (min·mg protein)−1 for intact mitochondria, mitochondrial homogenates, and submitochondrial particles, respectively. The activities obtained with mitochondrial homogenates and submitochondrial particles were higher than those obtained with intact mitochondria because the former were assessed under conditions for optimal NOS activity. A comparison of the rates of SMP and mitochondrial homogenates under identical conditions indicated that most of the activity was detected in the mitochondrial inner membrane (considering that 30% of the rat liver mitochondria protein corresponds to the inner membrane fraction (33Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar), 25–35% of the particles had the “right side-in” conformation (34Giulivi C. Boveris A. Cadenas E. Gilbert D. Colton E. Reactive Oxygen Species in Biological Systems. Plenum Press, New York1998Google Scholar), and 80% of the activity (experimentally determined) was recovered after the sonication procedure) suggesting that NOS could be mainly (60–80%) localized in this membrane fraction. The production of NO⋅ by intact mitochondria was followed by the NMMA-sensitive oxidation of oxymyoglobin in the presence ofl-Arg (Fig. 4 A). The rapid onset of the production was indicative of a fast transport ofl-Arg into mitochondria, consistent with the reportedl-Arg carriers found in isolated mitochondria from different tissues (35Keller D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 153: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 36Grazi E. Magri E. Balboni G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 60: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Kwong E. Tsai S. Nesheim M.C. J. Nutr. 1982; 112: 2081-2090PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of NO⋅ production by mitochondria yielded a classic hyperbolic response saturated withl-Arg concentrations above 20 μm (Fig. 4 A). The apparent K m forl-Arg was 5 μm (1.1 nmol/mg of protein) and the V max was 0.38 μm/min calculated from double-reciprocal plots (Fig. 4 A,inset). These kinetic constants were consistent with those observed for permeabilized mitochondria (V max = 5 nmol of NO⋅/min/mg of protein, and K m forl-Arg of 7 μm; Fig. 4 B), as well as with those reported for brain homogenates (as sources of nNOS) during the conversion of l-Arg to citrulline (K m = 6 μm for Arg andV max = 0.15 μmol/min/mg protein; Ref. 38Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). TheK m for l-Arg was 20–50 times lower than the matrix concentration of l-Arg (150–300 μm; Refs. 39Freedland R.A. Crazier G.L. Hicks B.L. Meijer A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 802: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and 40Freedland R.A. Meijer A.J. Tager J.M. Fed. Proc. 1985; 44: 2453-2457PubMed Google Scholar), a value within the normal range ofl-Arg in rat liver (20–50 nmol/g wet weight; Ref. 25Cheung C.-W. Raijman L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), when expressed per gram of liver wet weight (38 nmol/g wet weight). These concentrations indicate that mtNOS could be functionally active based on the requirements of l-Arg availability under normal conditions, and that if the kinetic properties of mtNOS in intact mitochondria are similar to those in vivo, it is unlikely that Arg levels play an important role in the regulation of mtNOS. A slow rate of NO⋅ production by intact mitochondria was also detected in the absence of added l-Arg (11 nm/min; Fig. 4 A). This rate may reflect a slow but constant production of NO⋅ by mitochondria using endogenousl-Arg, which may be increased under special pathophysiological conditions, such as those entailing an elevation of Ca2+. The NO⋅ production by intact mitochondria was not altered byd-Arg addition, was partially inhibited by NIO, and was totally inhibited by NMMA (Table IV). The lack of effect by the addition of d-Arg may be explained by the selectivity of the Arg transporter for the l-isomer, and the partial inhibition by NIO can be accounted for by a limited permeability of the inhibitor. Consistent with this possibility is a noted increase in the inhibition of of NO⋅ production by the pre-incubation of mitochondria with NIO (Table IV).Table IVInhibition of NO· production by intact mitochondriaAdditionsInhibition of NO· productionNo incubationPreincubation%d-Arginine1.22.5NIO6.243.2NMMA100.0100.0 Open table in a new tab In similar experiments, preincubation (10–15 min) of SMP with 5 mm NMMA was found to inhibit the endogenous production of NO⋅, whereas the addition of l-Arg reversed such inhibition (Table V).Table VProduction of NO· by submitochondrial particlesAdditionsTotal activitySpecific activitynmol/minnmol NO·/min/mg proteinNMMA (5 mm)1.190.0 Plusl-Arg (1 mm)1.360.4 Plusl-Arg (10 mm)4.007.0 Open table in a new tab The following lines of evidence offer support for the mitochondrial generation of NO⋅. First, the negligible contamination of the mitochondrial preparations with other subcellular fractions (Table I) and the integrity and functionality of these preparations (Table II) support the production of NO⋅ by mitochondria. Second, the production of NO⋅ by mitochondria was demonstrated by two different spectroscopic assays: the formation of metmyoglobin, and spin trapping/EPR. To rule out species other than NO⋅reacting with oxymyoglobin (41Zafiriou O.C. McFarland M. Anal. Chem. 1980; 52: 1662-1667Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 42Kosaka H. Tyuma L. Environ.

Ther. 1990; 252: 922-928PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of oxidation of oxymyoglobin was monitored under controlled conditions (with catalase and superoxide dismutase and measuring sensitivity to NMMA). However, because some NO⋅-derived oxides may still be able to produce this reaction, unequivocal identification of NO⋅ was furnished by using the spin trap MGD, the iron-nitrosyl complex ESR signal of which is considered a “fingerprint” of NO⋅ (21Kotake Y. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 222-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kotake Y. Tanigawa T. Tanigawa M. Ueno I. Allen D.R. Lai C.-S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The advantages of this technique (selectivity of the spin trap toward NO⋅ and the lack of toxicity of the spin trap in biological systems) were initially limited by the free access of the spin trap to the biological source, the low recovery of the iron-nitrosyl adduct, and the presence of quenchers of NO⋅ (e.g.hemoproteins, [Fe-S] clusters) that effectively compete with the spin trap MGD. These limitations were overcome by using millimolar concentrations of the spin trap (to effectively compete with other possible NO⋅ quenchers) with toluene-treated mitochondria and mitochondrial homogenates (to allow free access of the spin trap to the biological source of NO⋅). The use of submitochondrial particles and mitochondrial homogenates, albeit less physiologically relevant than intact mitochondria, devoid of the limitations noted above permitted the selection of optimal conditions for NO⋅ production by mitochondria. Third, the production of NO⋅ is catalyzed by an enzyme, likely a NOS isoform, located at the mitochondrial inner membrane. This was inferred from three separate lines of evidence. (i) NO⋅production was modulated by NOS substrates (l-Arg) and inhibitors (NMMA, NIO, and d-Arg); (ii) the rate of NO⋅ production by mitochondria and SMP versus l-Arg concentration followed a similar pattern to that described for NOS purified from different tissues; (iii) the higher specific activities in SMP or crude fraction (about 2 and 10 times higher, respectively) than those obtained with mitochondrial homogenates or permeabilized-mitochondria were indicative of an enzymic activity located at the inner membrane. Conclusive evidence that a NOS isoform was responsible for the NO⋅ production was provided by the purification and characterization of the enzyme from purified rat liver mitochondria reported in the accompanying paper (46Tatoyan A. Giulivi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The rate of NO⋅ production by rat liver mitochondria reported herein and by others 4C. Richter, personal communication. is similar to that of O·̄2 (about 1.2 nmol of O·̄2/min/mg of protein, equivalent to 0.6 nmol of H2O2/min/mg of protein; Ref. 33Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). At saturating concentrations ofl-Arg, a steady-state concentration of NO⋅ in the range of 0.1–0.5 μm may be sustained. These values contemplate the reaction of NO⋅ with cytochrome oxidase or with O2 as the main catabolic pathways. Of note, this level of NO⋅ is biologically relevant because it is in the range of those concentrations reported to inhibit respiration in synaptosomes (47Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) and intact mitochondria (48Poderoso J.J. Carreras M.C. Lisdero C. Riobó N. Schopper F. Boveris A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Given the role of NO⋅ as cellular messenger, transmitter, and regulator (1Moncada S. Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 2Ignarro L.J. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 3Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The RGS domain directly interacted with the region containing the 20-amino acid repeats but not with that containing the 15-amino acid repeats of APC, although both regions are known to bind to β-catenin. In the region containing seven 20-amino acid repeats, the region containing the latter five repeats bound to the RGS domain of Axin. Axin and β-catenin simultaneously interacted with APC. Furthermore, Axin stimulated the degradation of β-catenin in COS cells. Taken together with our recent observations that Axin directly interacts with glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and β-catenin and that it promotes GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin, these results suggest that Axin, APC, GSK-3β, and β-catenin make a tetrameric complex, resulting in the regulation of the stabilization of β-catenin.

Axin, which is a product of the mouse Fused locus, has been identified as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway (1Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar).

Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), Axin could exert its effects on axis formation by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway. However, the molecular mechanism by which Axin regulates axis formation has not been shown. We have recently identified rat Axin (rAxin) as a GSK-3β-interacting protein (5Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). rAxin is phosphorylated by GSK-3β, directly binds to not only GSK-3β but also β-catenin, and promotes GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin (5Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Because the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β is essential for the down-regulation of β-catenin (6Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 7Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), our results suggest that rAxin may induce the degradation of β-catenin. These actions of rAxin are consistent with the observation that Axin inhibits dorsal axis formation in Xenopus embryos, because the accumulation of β-catenin induces the axis duplication (8Funayama N. Fagotto F. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). It has been shown that besides the phosphorylation by GSK-3β, the down-regulation of β-catenin requires APC, which is a tumor suppressor linked to FAP and to the initiation of sporadic human colorectal cancer (9Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar). The middle portion of APC contains three successive 15-amino acid (aa) repeats followed by seven related but distinct 20-aa repeats. Both types of repeats are able to bind independently to β-catenin (10Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Müller O. Chamberlain S.H. Masiarz F.R. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1993; 262: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 11Su L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar, 12Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5549-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In FAP and colorectal cancers, most patients carry APC mutations that result in the expression of truncated proteins (9Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar). Almost all mutant proteins lack the C-terminal half including most of the 20-aa repeats but retain the 15-aa repeats. Colorectal carcinoma cells with mutant APC contain large amounts of monomeric β-catenin (13Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The accumulated β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, and this translocation involves the association of β-catenin with the transcription enhancers of the lymphocyte enhancer binding factor/T cell factor family (14Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar, 15Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J. Godsave S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destrée O. Clevers H. Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). Because the APC mutants retain the β-catenin-binding activity, the interaction of APC with β-catenin is not sufficient for the down-regulation of β-catenin. How APC down-regulates β-catenin and the relationship between APC and Axin in the degradation of β-catenin are not clear. In addition to GSK-3β- and β-catenin-binding sites, rAxin has a domain that is homologous to RGS, and this domain is called the RGS domain (1Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 5Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). RGS has been originally identified as a protein that binds to the GTP- but not GDP-bound form of Gα and stimulates GTP hydrolysis of Gα (16Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). It has been shown that ΔRGS, a mutant of Axin in which the RGS domain is deleted, acts as a potent dorsalizer, producing a secondary axis and that Axin blocks the axis-inducing activity of ΔRGS (1Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). These results indicate that ΔRGS acts through a dominant-negative mechanism to inhibit an endogenous Axin activity and that it competes for binding to a protein with which Axin normally interacts. Therefore, the RGS domain may have an activity to transmit the signal by interacting with other protein(s). Here we report that the RGS domain of rAxin directly interacts with the region containing the 20-aa repeats of APC and that rAxin stimulates the down-regulation of β-catenin. Taken together with our recent observations (5Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), these results indicate that Axin directly binds to APC, β-catenin, and GSK-3β and that it regulates the stabilization of β-catenin.

Other materials and chemicals were from commercial sources. pEF-BOS-Myc/rAxin (full-length), pBSKS/rAxin (full-length), pBJ-Myc/rAxin-(1–229), pEF-BOS-Myc/rAxin-(1–713), pBJ-Myc/rAxin-(298–713), pEF-BOS/Myc-rAxin-(298–506), pBJ-Myc/rAxin-(713–832), pGEX-2T/β-catenin, and pMAL-c2/rAxin-(298–506) were constructed as described (5Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). To construct pGEX-2T/RGS, the RGS cDNA fragment encoding rAxin-(89–216) was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pGEX-2T. To construct pMAL-c2 containing APC mutants, pMKITneo/APC was digested with various restriction enzymes, and the APC cDNA fragments were inserted into pMAL-c2. These procedures will be described in detail elsewhere. To construct pMAL-c2/rAxin (full-length), pBSKS/rAxin was digested with SmaI andEcoRV, and the rAxin cDNA fragment was inserted into pMALc-2, which was digested with XbaI and blunted with Klenow fragment. To construct pGEX-2T/rAxin-(1–529), pBSKS/rAxin was digested with SmaI and PvuII, and this fragment was inserted into SmaI cut pGEX-2T. To construct pCGN/β-catenin, pBSSK/β-catenin was digested with XhoI, blunted with Klenow fragment, and digested with XbaI. The β-catenin cDNA fragment was inserted into pCGN. COS cells (10-cm diameter dish) transfected with pBJ- and pEF-BOS-derived plasmids were lysed as described (17Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol.

The lysates (160–800 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, then the precipitates were probed with the anti-APC and β-catenin antibodies. When the interaction of the RGS domain of rAxin with APC was examined in vitro, 1 μm GST-RGS was incubated with the lysates (200 μg of protein) of COS, 293, L, SW480, and DLD-1 cells for 2 h at 4 °C. GST-RGS were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and the precipitates were probed with the anti-APC antibody. Various deletion mutants of MBP-APC (0.5–10 pmol) immobilized on the amylose resin were incubated with various concentrations of GST-RGS, GST-rAxin-(1–529), and GST-β-catenin in 100 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 2 h at 4 °C. MBP fusion proteins were precipitated by centrifugation, and the precipitates were probed with the anti-GST antibody. When the effect of rAxin on the interaction of APC with β-catenin was examined, 50 nmGST-β-catenin was incubated with 250 nmMBP-APC-(959–1338) in the presence of various concentrations of MBP-rAxin-(298–506) or MBP-rAxin (full-length) in 100 μl of reaction mixture for 2 h at 4 °C. GST-β-catenin was precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and the precipitates were probed with the anti-MBP antibody. Where specified, the relative intensities of the precipitated GST and MBP fusion proteins were quantitated by densitometric tracing of the stained sheets using an NIH image program. COS cells (60–70% confluent on a 35-mm diameter dish) were transfected with pCGN/β-catenin alone or with pCGN/β-catenin and pEF-BOS-Myc/rAxin (full-length). After 60 h, pulse-chase analysis was performed as described (13Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (50 μCi/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Then the cells were lysed immediately or at the indicated times following incubation with excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody, and the precipitates were probed with the anti-HA antibody and analyzed with a Fuji BAS 2000 image analyzer. We have recently found that rAxin directly binds to β-catenin (5Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that β-catenin directly binds to APC (10Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Müller O. Chamberlain S.H. Masiarz F.R. Munemitsu S. Polakis P.

Souza B. Albert I. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5549-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), we examined whether rAxin makes a complex with APC through β-catenin. Various deletion mutants of Myc-rAxin expressed in COS cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody. Consistent with our recent observations (5Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), β-catenin was coprecipitated with Myc-rAxin (full-length), Myc-rAxin-(1–713), Myc-rAxin-(298–713), and Myc-rAxin-(298–506) (Fig. 1 A). Among them, APC was detected in the Myc-rAxin (full-length) and Myc-rAxin-(1–713) immune complexes, but not in the Myc-rAxin-(298–713) and Myc-rAxin-(298–506) immune complexes (Fig. 1 A). Unexpectedly, APC but not β-catenin was detected in the Myc-rAxin-(1–229) immune complex. Neither β-catenin nor APC was coprecipitated with Myc-rAxin-(713–832). Because rAxin-(1–229) contains the RGS domain, we examined whether the RGS domain itself (amino acids 89–216) makes a complex with APC. APC in COS, 293, and L cells was coprecipitated with GST-RGS (Fig. 1 B). It is known that APC is truncated at amino acids 1337 and 1427 in SW480 and DLD-1 cells, respectively, and that these truncated forms of APC fail to down-regulate β-catenin (9Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar,13Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). These APC mutants in SW480 and DLD-1 cells were not coprecipitated with GST-RGS (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with the previous observations (10Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Müller O. Chamberlain S.H. Masiarz F.R. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1993; 262: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 11Su L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), both full-length and truncated APC were coprecipitated with GST-β-catenin (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the RGS domain of rAxin makes a complex with the C-terminal half of APC in intact cells. Taken together with our observations (5Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), rAxin has distinct binding sites for APC, β-catenin, and GSK-3β. It is notable that the APC mutants in colorectal carcinoma cell lines such as SW480 and DLD-1 cells do not associate with rAxin. To examine whether the RGS domain of rAxin directly interacts with APC, various deletion mutants of APC were purified as MBP fusion proteins (Fig. 2 A). GST-RGS bound to MBP-APC-(1211–2075), which contains seven 20-aa repeats, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). TheK d value was calculated to be 115 nm. However, GST-RGS did not bind to MBP-APC-(959–1338) which contains three 15-aa repeats and the first 20-aa repeat (Fig. 2 B). These results show that the RGS domain of rAxin directly interacts with the region containing the 20-aa repeats of APC. To characterize the interaction of APC with rAxin further, MBP-APC-(1211–1787), which contains the former four 20-aa repeats, and MBP-APC-(1788–2075), which contains the latter three 20-aa repeats, were purified. Both GST-RGS and GST-β-catenin bound to MBP-APC-(1211–1787), but they bound to MBP-APC-(1788–2075) less efficiently (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, GST-β-catenin bound to both MBP-APC-(1211–1495) and MBP-APC-(1475–1787), whereas GST-RGS bound to MBP-APC-(1475–1787) but not to MBP-APC-(1211–1495) (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, the RGS domain does not interact with the region of APC containing the 15-aa repeats and the first and the second 20-aa repeats, which binds to β-catenin. These results are consistent with the observations that β-catenin but not the RGS domain of rAxin associated with the APC mutants in SW480 and DLD-1 cells. A family of RGS proteins has been identified in eukaryotic species ranging from yeast to mammals (16Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of a stable complex of RGS4 and Gαi1 has been determined (20Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Residues that form the hydrophobic core of the RGS box of RGS4 are well conserved in the RGS domain of rAxin. However, 11 residues of RGS4 that make direct contact with Gαi1 are not conserved in the RGS domain of rAxin except for one amino acid. Therefore, it is conceivable that the RGS domain interacts with the proteins other than the α subunit of G proteins. Our results are the first demonstration that a member of the RGS protein family has a binding partner other than the α subunit of G proteins. We have found that rAxin-(298–506) directly binds to β-catenin-(175–423), which contains armadillo repeats 2–7 (5Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). APC interacts with the armadillo repeats 2–10 of β-catenin (12Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5549-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether rAxin and APC share the binding site on β-catenin. GST-β-catenin bound to MBP-rAxin-(298–506) and MBP-APC-(959–1338) in a dose-dependent manner, and theirK d values were calculated to be 227 nmand 273 nm, respectively (data not shown). MBP-rAxin-(298–506) inhibited the binding of MBP-APC-(959–1338) to GST-β-catenin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). MBP-rAxin (full-length) also inhibited their binding although the inhibitory efficiency was less than MBP-rAxin-(298–506) (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, we examined the effect of rAxin-(1–529), which contains the binding sites for APC and β-catenin, on the interaction of β-catenin with MBP-APC-(1211–1787), which binds to both β-catenin and rAxin. Although GST-rAxin-(1–529) bound to MBP-APC-(1211–1787) in a dose-dependent manner, it did not affect significantly the interaction of GST-β-catenin with MBP-APC-(1211–1787) (Fig. 3 B). These results are consistent with the results that in APC-(1211–1787) β-catenin prefers APC-(1211–1495) to APC-(1475–1787); inversely the RGS domain binds to APC-(1475–1787) but not to APC-(1211–1495). Taken together, although the β-catenin-binding sites of rAxin and APC do not simultaneously bind to β-catenin, β-catenin does not compete with rAxin for the binding to APC when they are full-length proteins. Furthermore, since rAxin has distinct binding sites for APC and β-catenin, these three proteins could make a complex. It has been shown that APC down-regulates the level of β-catenin (9Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar,13Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). This APC activity was localized to the central region of the protein which contains at least three of the 20-aa repeat sequence (9Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar). The fragment containing the 15-aa repeats and the first 20-aa repeat does not down-regulate β-catenin (9Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that this region binds to β-catenin but not to the RGS domain of rAxin. Therefore, the binding of APC to β-catenin is not sufficient for decreasing the β-catenin level, and the binding to Axin may be necessary. To investigate whether rAxin regulates the stabilization of β-catenin, pulse-chase analysis in COS cells expressing HA-β-catenin was performed. Although equivalent amounts of HA-β-catenin were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody from the lysates of COS cells expressing HA-β-catenin alone and coexpressing HA-β-catenin and Myc-rAxin as assessed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown), pulse-labeled. HA-β-catenin gradually decreased with a half-life of 4 h (Fig. 4). When Myc-rAxin was cotransfected, HA-β-catenin exhibited a shorter half-life (Fig. 4). These results indicate that rAxin has an activity to stimulate the down-regulation of β-catenin. To down-regulate β-catenin, its phosphorylation by GSK-3β is required, and the mutations of the phosphorylation site stabilize β-catenin (7Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). It has been reported recently that β-catenin is ubiquitinated and that the ubiquitination of β-catenin is abolished when the GSK-3β phosphorylation site in β-catenin is mutated (21Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). Therefore, the degradation of β-catenin could be regulated by the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Taken together with our observations that rAxin promotes GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin (5Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), the present results strongly suggest that rAxin stimulates the down-regulation of β-catenin in cooperation with APC. Literally hundreds of APC mutants have been reported in FAP and cancer patients (9Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar). Almost all of these mutations are confined to the 5′-half of the APC coding sequence and result in truncation of APC, which lacks the C-terminal half containing most of the 20-aa repeats. Our results indicate that these APC mutants do not interact with rAxin. Therefore, the reason why mutations of APC cause cancer may be due to its inability to bind to Axin. It has been reported that there are mutations of serine in consensus sequence of the phosphorylation site of β-catenin for GSK-3β in melanoma and colon cancer that have normal APC protein (22Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 23Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V.

Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Thus, there are at least two ways to increase levels of β-catenin due to mutations in APC and β-catenin itself. Therefore, mutations in APC-, GSK-3β-, and β-catenin-binding sites on Axin may cause human cancer. We thank Drs. T. Akiyama, K. Morishita, A. Nagafuchi, Sh. Tsukita, and E.

We show here that the small heat-shock protein IbpB is a molecular chaperone that assists the refolding of denatured proteins in the presence of other chaperones. IbpB oligomers bind and stabilize heat-denatured malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and urea-denatured lactate dehydrogenase and thus prevent the irreversible aggregation of these proteins during stress. While IbpB-stabilized proteins alone do not refold spontaneously, they are specifically delivered to the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (KJE) chaperone system where they refold in a strict ATPase-dependent manner. Although GroEL/GroES (LS) chaperonins do not interact directly with IbpB-released proteins, LS accelerate the rate of KJE-mediated refolding of IbpB-released MDH, and to a lesser extent lactate dehydrogenase, by rapidly processing KJE-released early intermediates. Kinetic and gel-filtration analysis showed that denatured MDH preferentially transfers from IbpB to KJE, then from KJE to LS, and then forms a active enzyme. IbpB thus stabilizes aggregation-prone folding intermediates during stress and, as an integral part of a cooperative multichaperone network, is involved in the active refolding of stress-denatured proteins.

Whereas various sHSPs share weak sequence homologies (1Plesofsky-Vig N. Vig J. Brambl R. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Buchner J. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 533-575Google Scholar), many sHSPs appear to be functionally and structurally related. Many sHSPs assemble into large globular complexes, whose oligomeric structures may vary depending on the degree of subunit phosphorylation or the concentration of ions (3Lee G.J. Pokala N.

The overexpression of sHSPs in plant, yeast, and in mammal cells correlates with increased levels of thermal resistance (6Landry J. Chrétien P. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. J.

In vitro, sHSPs specifically recognize, bind, and prevent the aggregation of non-native proteins during stress (3Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol.

Weiss C. Azem A FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), sHSPs can serve as an efficient binding reservoir for unstable protein-folding intermediates during stress. However, at variance with other molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70, Hsp60, Hsp104, and Hsp90 (for a review, see Ref. 13Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), small HSPs do not hydrolyze ATP and do not display a specific ability to promote the correct refolding of the bound stabilized proteins (3Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 4Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J.

The small heat shock proteins IbpA and IbpB from Escherichia coli are two sequence-related 14- and 16-kDa proteins, respectively, co-transcribed during stress by the bacterial heat-shock transcription factor ς32 (14Allen S.P. Polazzim J.O. Giersem J.K. Easton A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IbpA and IbpB share a low sequence homology in their C-terminal region with sHSPs from yeast, plants, and mammals, including αB-crystallines (14Allen S.P. Polazzim J.O. Giersem J.K. Easton A.M. J.

Furthermore, they seem to be distantly related to other bacterial chaperones such as PapD and Caf1M. Based on the resolved x-ray structure of the PapD chaperone and on sequence homology, a model has been proposed where the three-dimensional structure of IbpB resembles that of immunoglobulins (20Zav'yalov V.P. Zav'yalova G.A. Denesyuk A.I. Gaestel M. Korpela T. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1995; 11: 265-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, IbpA and IbpB are found associated with endogenous proteins that aggregate intracellularly during heat-shock (21Laskowska E. Wawrzynow A. Taylor A. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and with non-native recombinant proteins in inclusion bodies (14Allen S.P. Polazzim J.O. Giersem J.K. Easton A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are implicated in the solubilization of protein aggregates after stress (21Laskowska E. Wawrzynow A. Taylor A. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In vitro, IbpB is a large globular complex, whose oligomeric state may vary at different temperatures and ionic concentrations. 2A. Azem, J. Buchner, and P. Goloubinoff, unpublished data. Similarly to other small HSPs, light-scattering measurements indicate that IbpB can specifically bind thermally or chemically denatured proteins such as MDH, LDH, and citrate synthase and thus prevent their irreversible aggregation (not shown). We show here that IbpB can bind and stabilize denatured proteins, and furthermore, deliver them to the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (KJE) chaperone system for subsequent active ATP-dependent refolding. KJE-mediated refolding of IbpB-stabilized proteins can be further activated by LS chaperonins, demonstrating cooperation between the different chaperone systems. IbpB can therefore function as a primordial protein-binding element of a multichaperone network, involved in stabilizing and active refolding of stress-denatured proteins. Wild type and E. coli B mutant T850 (22Takano T. Kakefuda T. Nat.

IbpB was purified as follows: late log phaseE. coli cells, containing plasmid pBF3-IbpB in LB medium and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml), were incubated for an additional 12 h at 37 °C in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 μg/ml), collected, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgAc2 (Buffer A), containing 5 μg/ml leupeptin.

The protein pellet from 30,000 × g was resuspended in buffer A, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Schleicher & Schuell), and separated by gel filtration (0.5 ml/min) on a semi-preparative Superose 6B column (Pharmacia) in buffer A. The fractions collected between 6.0 and 7.5 ml (above 2.106 daltons), which were highly enriched with soluble oligomeric IbpB, were applied to a resource-Q column (Pharmacia), equilibrated with buffer A. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient from 150 to 500 mm KCl in Buffer A. The fractions eluting at 230 ± 30 mm were collected and frozen as 34–45 μm (protomer) 95% pure IbpB stock solutions.

Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). In this study, all chaperone concentrations were expressed in terms of the individual protomers.

The time-dependent oxidation of NADH by MDH or LDH was monitored at 340 nm. Native MDH dimers remain stable and active in solutions above a concentration of 6 nm(protomers) (29Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Heider I. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The apparent rates of protein refolding were calculated from the time-dependent changes in the enzymatic activity of chaperonin solutions containing more than 20 nmenzyme. 3H-Labeled MDH (0.25 μm) was heat-denatured in the presence of IbpB (4 μm), DnaK + DnaJ (4, 0.8 μm) or GroEL (4 μm), and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with ATP and ATP-regeneration systems, in the absence or presence of KJ, KJEL, or L (Fig. 5). A Superose 6B gel filtration column (Pharmacia) (at 0.5 ml min−1), run in the presence of the refolding buffer and 1 mm ATP was used for separation. 3H-Labeled samples were collected at the indicated elution volumes (Fig. 5), mixed with a 6-fold volume of LumaxTM, and counted. Wild type E. coli B cells are highly sensitive to T4 phages (23Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Baird L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1134-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the mutant strain T850, which contains a chromosomal groEL with a R268C mutation, 3C. Weiss, S. Gross, and P. Goloubinoff, personal communication. do not support T4 growth (Fig. 1). We found that phage growth was specifically restored in T850 cells containing plasmid-encoded ibpA or ibpB genes (Fig. 1), however, only in the presence of a higher phage titer (108particles/ml) than in wild type cells. When exposed to 47 °C, the thermolabile enzyme MDH is inactivated at an apparent rate of 0.13 min−1 (11Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and forms large insoluble protein aggregates that do not refold spontaneously after the heat shock (not shown). In contrast, when exposed to heat stress in the presence of a 4-fold molar excess of thermostable IbpB, MDH was inactivated at a slower rate (0.10 min−1) and formed a stable soluble IbpB·MDH complex.2 We found that the IbpB·MDH did not significantly reactivate, even after a 5-h incubation at room temperature (Fig. 2 A). However, when IbpB·MDH was supplemented with KJE chaperones and ATP, a significant amount (10%) of native MDH was slowly recovered, at a slow rate of ∼0.7 nm min−1. This KJE-mediated refolding of IbpB·MDH was a specific reaction, as it did not occur when IbpB was absent during the heat denaturation (Fig. 2,A and B), or when ATP or GrpE were absent during renaturation (not shown). When IbpB·MDH was supplemented with LS chaperonins and ATP, only insignificant amounts of MDH were reactivated (1.5%), in addition to the small amounts generated by spontaneous refolding (2.5% within 4–5 h, Fig. 2 A). Remarkably, when KJE and LS chaperones and ATP were concomitantly added to IbpB·MDH after the heat shock, a major fraction (40%) of the MDH was actively recovered at an apparent rate 5.5 times higher (3.7 nm min−1), than without LS (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, a significant amount (10%) of MDH that was heat-inactivated without IbpB was also recovered at a slow rate of 0.8 nm min−1, but only in the presence of the two chaperone systems KJE and LS (Fig. 2 B). The strong dependence of the refolding rates and yields of MDH, on the presence of IbpB during denaturation, could be used as a first functional assay for a small heat-shock protein under stringent conditions. The yields of the reaction depended on the concentration of IbpB present during the heat-denaturation of MDH (Fig. 3 A). When denatured in the presence of a 20-fold molar excess of IbpB, up to 83% of the denatured MDH was recovered by KJE + LS after the stress. Half of the MDH molecules were recovered when denatured in the presence of a 5.7 molar excess of IbpB (Fig. 3 A). The refolding rate of IbpB·MDH was half-maximal when the LS concentration (fixed 1:1 ratio between L and S) was one-fifth that of DnaK (4, 4, and 0.5 μm of K, J, and E, respectively), or when the KJE concentration (with a fixed molar ratio of 4:4:0.5) was half that of the LS (4:4 μmeach) (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that at near equimolar DnaK and GroEL concentrations, as in the cell (30Neidhardt F.C. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhymorium. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1334-1345Google Scholar), the KJE chaperones are more rate-limiting for this reaction than the LS chaperonins. The apparent refolding rate of heat-preformed KJE·MDH complexes was 8.6 times slower than the refolding rate of heat-preformed LS·MDH complexes (Table I). This difference was exploited to address, by kinetic measurements, the order of events during multichaperone IbpB/KJE/LS-mediated refolding reactions. The refolding rates of heat-preformed IbpB·MDH complexes (Fig. 4 A) was compared with heat-preformed KJ·MDH and GroEL·MDH complexes (Fig. 4 B), in the presence of various co-chaperones added either immediately or 53 min after the heat shock.Table IApparent rates of MDH refolding after heat denaturationChaperone present during heat shockChaperone and ATP added after heat shockApparent rate of refolding t = 0t = 53 minnm min −1IbpBATP + KJENo0.64IbpBATP + KJE0.67IbpBNoATP + KJE0.28IbpBATP + LSNo0.09IbpBATP + KJELSNo1.96IbpBATP + KJELS4.25IbpBNoATP + KJELS1.15IbpBATP + KJELS2.99KJATP + ENo1.17KJATP + IbpB + ENo0.40KJATP + ELSNo7.20KJATP + IbpB + ELSNo7.64LATP + SNo7.33 Open table in a new tab Significant refolding of IbpB·MDH was observed only when supplemented after the heat shock with the three chaperones KJE and ATP, however, at a rate which was about half (Fig. 4 A; Table I, 0.64 nm min−1) that of GrpE-mediated refolding of KJ-MDH (Fig. 4 A; Table I, 1.17 nmmin−1). When the addition of ATP and KJE or KJELS was delayed for 53 min after the heat shock, the refolding rate of IbpB·MDH was significantly lower (Table I, 0.28 and 1.15 nm min−1, respectively), than without a delay (0.64 and 1.96 nm min−1, respectively). This suggests that the IbpB·MDH is a lose complex from which aggregation-prone MDH can dissociate. While LS and ATP alone did not directly assist the refolding of IbpB·MDH (Fig. 2 A; Table I, 0.09 nmmin−1), the presence of LS chaperonins tripled the rate (and yields, not shown) of KJE-mediated refolding of IbpB·MDH (Fig. 4 A, 1.96 nm min−1). Noticeably, the extent of LS activation of the KJE-mediated refolding of IbpB·MDH was yet 4 times slower than that of E + LS-mediated refolding of KJ-MDH (Fig. 4 B; Table I, 7.2 nmmin−1). Remarkably, delaying the addition of E + LS to IbpB·MDH which was incubated 53 min with ATP and KJ, increased the rate of refolding from 1.96 to 2.99 nm min−1 (Fig. 4 A; Table I). Likewise, delaying the addition of GroES to IbpB·MDH which was incubated 53 min with ATP and KJEL, more than doubled the refolding rates from 1.96 to 4.25 nm min−1 (Fig. 4 A; Table I). Thus, the rate-limiting dissociation of MDH from IbpB can be overcome by a delay during which it is allowed to transfer on KJ and then on GroEL. Whereas GrpE-mediated refolding of KJ-MDH was inhibited 3-fold in the presence of added free (equimolar) IbpB (Table I, 1.17 → 0.4 nm min−1), LS enhancement of KJE-MDH was not inhibited by added IbpB (Table I, 7.2 → 7.64 nm min−1). This indicates that, at this late stage of refolding, GroEL has a much higher affinity to the protein than KJE and IbpB. The refolding of urea-denatured LDH displayed a similar dependence on the various components of the IbpB/KJE/LS chaperone network. LDH is a thermostable enzyme, which therefore requires first to be denatured in 5 m urea (11Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) before being diluted into IbpB, LS, or KJ solutions and further incubated as MDH at 47 °C. Like MDH, LDH alone did not reactivate from the urea-heat denaturation, and no spontaneous refolding was observed even upon addition of KJE or ATP after the stress (not shown). Nor did urea-heat denatured LDH in the presence of IbpB (IbpB-LDH) refold after the stress in the presence of ATP alone, or with supplemented KJ or LS chaperones alone (not shown). Only in the presence of KJE or KJELS chaperones did IbpB-LDH actively refold in a strict ATP-dependent manner (TableII). KJE-mediated refolding of IbpB-LDH (0.73 nm min−1) was slower than GrpE-mediated refolding of KJ-LDH (0.89 nm min−1), and KJELS-mediated refolding of IbpB-LDH (0.93 nmmin−1) was slower than ELS-mediated refolding of KJ-LDH (1.27 nm min−1), showing that the release of LDH from IbpB was rate-limiting. In contrast to MDH refolding, however, LS chaperonins did not triple, but only activated 1.3-fold, the rate of KJE-mediated refolding of IbpB-LDH (Table II, 0.96 nmmin−1), suggesting that LS chaperonins are not as important for LDH refolding, as for MDH refolding.Table IIApparent rates of LDH refolding after urea-heat denaturationChaperone present during heat shockChaperone and ATP added after heat shock, t = 0Apparent rate of refoldingnm min −1IbpBATP + LS0.01IbpBATP + KJE0.73IbpBATP + KJELS0.96LATP + S0.00KJATP + E0.89KJATP + ELS1.27 Open table in a new tab Gel filtration of chaperone complexes with bound heat-denatured 3H-labeled MDH provided direct evidence for directional MDH transfer from IbpB to KJE, then to LS, during reactivation (Fig. 5). While native complexes of IbpB exceed 2 × 106 daltons2 and consequently eluted near the void volume of the column (6–7.5 ml), individual native complexes of GroEL, KJ, or MDH, independently resolved at 11–13, 13.5–15.5, and 15.5–18 ml, respectively (arrows shown instead of profiles, Fig. 5). The elution profile of [3H]MDH, which had been heat-denatured in the presence of IbpB alone and then incubated 1 h with ATP alone prior to injection, distributed in two peaks; one together with IbpB, and the other in the low molecular weight region corresponding to free MDH (Fig. 5, profile 1). The elution profile of heat-denatured IbpB-bound MDH, incubated 1 h with KJ and ATP but without GrpE, showed 3H label associated to the broad KJ fraction, at the expense of the IbpB containing and the free MDH fractions (Fig. 5, profile 2). Thus, a significant amount of the non-native MDH was transferred after the heat shock from IbpB and from the free state to the KJ chaperones. In contrast, when IbpB-MDH was incubated with ATP, KJ, and in addition with E + L (without S), the majority of the3H label eluted associated to the GroEL fraction, at the expense of the IbpB-, KJ-, and free MDH-containing fractions (Fig. 5, profile 3). Thus, a significant amount of IbpB bound and free MDH, that was initially transferred to KJ, was further transferred to the GroEL. When KJ chaperones were omitted and IbpB-MDH was incubated directly with GroEL and ATP, less 3H label co-eluted with the GroEL fraction, and correspondingly, more MDH eluted with the IbpB-containing and free MDH fractions (Fig. 5, profile 4). When S and ATP were subsequently added, MDH activity was fully recovered from the GroEL fractions from profile 3 (+KJE + L) but not from profile 4 (+L) (data not shown), showing that direct binding and IbpB-released MDH to GroEL is non-productive. When, in a control experiment, [3H]MDH (0.35 μm) was heat-denatured in the presence of an equimolar excess all three types of chaperones together (IbpB, KJ, and L, 10 μm each), gel filtration showed that over 90% of the3H label co-eluted with GroEL (not shown). When GroEL was omitted during the denaturation, most of the 3H label co-eluted with KJ. Only when GroEL and KJ were both omitted during denaturation was a majority (60%) of the 3H label co-eluted with the IbpB (Fig. 5, track 1). This suggests that changes of affinity can define the sequence of transfer of folding intermediates between the various components of a chaperone network. Whereas small Hsps share with other molecular chaperones the ability to recognize, bind, and prevent the aggregation of non-native proteins under stress, the classification of small Hsps as true chaperones remains an open question because of their poor performance at specifically promoting the correct refolding of the sHsps-stabilized proteins. A first indication that sHsps may collaborate with other chaperones in the refolding of bound denatured proteins came from the observation that the refolding of heat-denatured citrate synthase bound to mammalian Hsp25, can be activated by Hsp70, even without ATP (4Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). We observed here that similarly to other small Hsps from eukaryotes (3Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 4Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J.

A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar), IbpB from E. coli can stabilize denatured proteins such as citrate synthase, α-glucosidase, and MDH in a soluble non-aggregated form.2 Remarkably, whereas IbpB alone did not promote the active refolding of bound proteins after the stress, IbpB-bound MDH or IbpB-LDH were specifically reactivated by KJE chaperones and ATP, but not directly by LS chaperonins. Hence, the apparent rate of refolding of IbpB-MDH was 50 times higher in the presence of KJE + LS chaperones and ATP, then without KJE + LS and the yield of the reaction was about one recovered MDH for 10 IbpB subunits present during denaturation. Similarly, ATP- and KJE-assisted refolding of IbpB-LDH was 70–90 times faster than without ATP or KJE. The kinetic and gel filtration data strongly suggested that MDH, but not necessarily LDH or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, was refolded in a sequential, multichaperone reaction. When native MDH was heat denatured in the presence of IbpB alone, an IbpB·MDH complex was formed which was in equilibrium after the heat shock with a free inactive MDH species. The IbpB-released MDH tended to convert into a kinetically trapped inactive species, unless allowed to bind KJE, but not LS chaperones. The slow dissociation of MDH from the IbpB·MDH complex was the rate-limiting step. Delays in the addition of the various chaperone components showed that MDH was first transferred to KJE chaperones, where it accumulated, unless allowed to partially fold and then interact with LS chaperonins. In contrast with the IbpB-released species (MDH1), which was characterized by a high affinity for the KJE chaperones and a low (non-productive) affinity for LS chaperonins, the KJE-released species (MDH2) had a low affinity for IbpB and a high affinity for LS chaperonins. The increased affinity of IbpB-released MDH1 for KJE, and of KJE-released MDH2 for LS provides a preferential pathway for the sequential MDH refolding in the multichaperone network, as follows: IbpB-MDH1 + KJE + LS ⇒ IbpB + KJE-MDH1 + LS ⇒ IbpB + KJE + LS-MDH2 ⇒ IbpB + KJE + LS + MDHnat. Binding to IbpB during the heat shock was also a prerequisite for a strict KJE- and ATP-dependent refolding of urea/heat-denatured LDH. However, KJE-released LDH species proceeded to the native state almost as rapidly without as with LS chaperonins, suggesting that LS was optional. Interestingly, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase displayed a yet different behavior. Fluorescence and light scattering indicated that heat-inactivated glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was neither aggregated nor bound to IbpB or LS. Whereas denatured glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase did not refold spontaneously, it was specifically refolded by KJE + ATP, but not by IbpB and/or by LS + ATP (data not shown). Hence, IbpB can serve as a specific high capacity scavenger for aggregation-prone folding intermediates, but it does not necessarily interact with all types of denatured proteins. It should be noted that the sequential IbpB → KJE → LS mediated refolding of MDH was observed only when MDH was heat denatured in the presence of IbpB alone. When saturative amounts of LS and KJE were also present during the denaturation, IbpB displayed the lowest affinity for denatured MDH. This implies that in the cell, various protein intermediates can bind and distribute according to the relative amounts, binding capacities of each of the chaperones present, and according to the specific affinity of the folding intermediates for the chaperones present during the stress. We propose a model that describes the various protein-folding pathways that may exist in the multichaperon network (Fig. 6). Upon denaturation, native proteins form an unstable folding intermediate that can either aggregate irreversibly, refold spontaneously (pathway 1), or distribute between several components of the chaperone network. Whereas acid-denatured barnase refolds spontaneously without chaperones (31Corrales F.J. Fersht A.R. Folding & Design. 1996; 1: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), heat-denatured MDH can bind all three components, depending on their relative abundance during denaturation. IbpB-MDH sequentially transfers to KJE, then to LS (pathway 4 → 5 → 6). KJE-MDH and LS-MDH preferentially used pathways 3 → 6 and2, respectively. Whereas, LDH denatured in urea for 30 s is preferentially refolded by LS (pathway 2) (11Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), urea-heat denatured LDH was refolded by IbpB and KJE, but not by LS (pathway 4 → 5). In contrast, the refolding of firefly luciferase denatured by guanidinium chloride and heat first required LS, then KJE (pathway 2 → 6) (32Buchberger A. Schröder H. Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In a yet different pathway, heat-denatured glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was refolded by KJE and not by IbpB or LS (pathway 3). Plasmid-encoded ibpA or ibpB partially suppressed a chromosomal groEL mutation leading to phage-growth deficiency. Because LS chaperonins are involved in protein-folding, prevention of protein aggregation during stress, and correct refolding after heat shock (11Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), this suppression is evidence that either IbpA or IbpB can replace, yet with low efficiency, some of the cellular functions carried on by the LS chaperonin. In eukaryotes, Hsp27, Hsp25, and αB-crystallines are found in protein granules of neurodegenerative diseases and after heat shock (33Mydlarski M.B. Schipper H.M. Brain Res. 1993; 627: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Schipper H.M. Cisse S. Glia. 1995; 14: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Head M.W. Corbin E. Goldman J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1743-1753PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila, heat-induced granules dissolve after stress (36Feder J.H. Rossi J.M. Solomon J. Solomon N. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1402-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Similarly, IbpA/B proteins were found in E. coliassociated with inclusion bodies and with heat-induced intracellular proteins aggregates. IbpA/B were found to be involved in the re-solubilization of protein aggregates after stress (21Laskowska E. Wawrzynow A. Taylor A. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here in vitro that IbpB-bound proteins are stabilized in a conformation that can be subsequently released and specifically refolded by the KJE chaperones and ATP. It is tempting to speculate that stress-denatured proteins that accumulate together with IbpA/B proteins in the E. coli cell, can be solubilized and refolded, or degraded after stress, in processes involving the KJE chaperones, ATP hydrolysis, and possibly other chaperones. Moreover, in eukaryotes where heat-shock granules and amyloid plaques often contain sHSPs (37Yokoyama N. Iwaki T. Goldman J.E. Tateishi J. Fukui M. Acta Neuropathol. 1993; 85: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35Head M.W. Corbin E. Goldman J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1743-1753PubMed Google Scholar), a similar solubilization mechanism of sHSP-bound protein aggregates, involving Hsp70 and other ATP-hydrolyzing chaperones such as Hsp104, is therefore also conceivable as a defense mechanism against neurodegenerative and prion diseases (38Patino M.M. Liu J.-J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). There are major differences in the expression level of the various families of Hsps between organisms. While heat shock induces a number of distinct Hsp families in E. coli and yeast (39Lorimer G.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), Hsp70 is by far the major heat-induced protein in Drosophila (38Patino M.M. Liu J.-J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), and small heat-shock proteins Hsp18.1 and Hsp17.7 are the major heat-induced proteins in higher plants (3Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 5Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). We find that small heat-shock proteins, while possibly binding non-native proteins with relatively low affinity, may yet serve as a primary protein-binding matrix for subsequent refolding by a highly cooperative multichaperone machinery. Despite their high binding efficiency, LS chaperonins may not be present in sufficient amounts to bind all non-native protein during cellular stress (39Lorimer G.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Hence, auxiliary chaperone systems such as sHsps may become essential in vivo for the stress response. We thank C.

Richter, personal communication.have reported that rat liver mitochondria produce NO⋅. This production has been unequivocally attributed to mitochondria, supported by the low contamination of the mitochondrial preparations with other subcellular fractions and the detection of NO⋅ by two spectroscopic techniques: the controlled oxidation of oxymyoglobin and spin-trapping/electron paramagnetic resonance, both of which were sensitive to NMMA inhibition. However, the role of a NOS was suggested by the modulation of the NO⋅ production by substrates and inhibitors of NOS, as well as by the kinetic constants, which were similar to those of other well characterized NOSs (29Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar).In this study, a NOS located in the membranes of rat liver mitochondria (mtNOS) was purified to homogeneity, and the enzymatic characteristics of this isoform were studied, yielding unambiguous evidence for the NOS-mediated production of NO⋅ by intact mitochondria. This generation of NO⋅ may have implications for oxygen consumption, ATP production, and oxygen free radical production by mitochondria.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and BiochemicalsEDTA, EGTA, sodium succinate, sodium malate, sodium glutamate, mannitol, sucrose, HEPES, bovine serum albumin (fatty-acid free), horse heart myoglobin, horse heart cytochrome c, inhibitors of proteolysis, NADPH, FAD, FMN, l-Arg, and CHAPS were purchased from Sigma. Catalase and superoxide dismutase were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Recombinant cytochrome P450reductase was obtained from Oxygene (Dallas, TX). The spin trapN-methyl-d-glucamine-dithiocarbamate-FeIIwas purchased from the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (Oklahoma City, OK). Oxymyoglobin was obtained as described before for oxyhemoglobin (30Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dimethoxynaphthoquinone was kindly provided by Dr. E. Cadenas. The antibodies against inducible, neuronal, and endothelial NOS were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The antibodies against iNOS were obtained using a 21-kDa protein fragment corresponding to amino acids 961–1144 of mouse macNOS as immunogen. All other reagents were of analytical grade.Biological MaterialsIsolation of Rat Liver Mitochondrial PreparationsLiver mitochondria were isolated from adult Wistar rats (180–200 g) by differential centrifugation (31Chance, B., Hagihara, B., Proceedings of the 5th International Congress in Biochemistry Moscow, Sissakian, A. N. M., 5, 1963, 3, 37, Pergamon Press, New York.Google Scholar). Purified mitochondria were obtained by Percoll gradient centrifugation (32Hovius R. Lambechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijiff V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) of the mitochondrial fraction, followed by two washings with high ionic strength solutions (150 mm KCl; Ref. 33Cohen N. Cheung C-W. Sijuwade E. Raijman L. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Toluene-permeabilized mitochondria were obtained as described in the accompanying paper (29Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures used with these preparations were supplemented with 8.5% polyethylene glycol (8 kDa).Purification of mtNOSPurified mitochondria from two to four rat livers, obtained as described above, were homogenized with Buffer A (1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). This homogenate, or 8,000 × g pellet, was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 0–4 °C. The mitochondrial membranes were then washed with Buffer B (Buffer A plus 1 m KCl, 10% glycerol) and centrifuged at the same speed for 30 min. The pellet was treated with Buffer A plus 20 mm CHAPS at 4 °C. After 30 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. This supernatant, concentrated in a Centricon-30™ cartridge (Amicon, Danvers, MA), was called crude fraction (150,000 × gsupernatant). This fraction was subsequently purified by affinity chromatography on a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column (5 ml of resin; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with Buffer C (10 mmCHAPS, 0.5 mml-Arg, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 7 mm reduced glutathione, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). The column was subsequently washed with Buffer C, Buffer D (Buffer C plus 0.5m NaCl, 3 mm malic acid, 0.2 mmNADP+), and again Buffer C. NOS activity was eluted with Buffer E (Buffer C plus 5 mm NADPH, 0.75 mm NADP+, 15 mm NaCl). Fractions that showed NOS activity were loaded onto a Sephadex G-200 column (20 ml resin) pre-equilibrated with 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mml-Arg, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Fractions that exhibited NOS activity and migrated as a single band of approximately 125–130 kDa on SDS-PAGE were pooled, concentrated in Centricon-30™ cartridge to final protein concentration of 0.1–0.5 mg/ml, supplemented with 10% glycerol, 0.5–1 mml-Arg, and 2–5 μm THB4, and stored at −80 °C.Biochemical AssaysSDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, and Western BlotDifferent fractions obtained during the purification of mtNOS (aliquots from 8,000 ×g pellet, 50,000 × g supernatant, and the eluate from the 2′, 5′-ADP Sepharose 4B column) were separated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing and reducing conditions using polyacrylamide gels (precast 10% polyacrylamide mini-gels from Novex, San Diego, CA or 4–15% polyacrylamide PhastGels from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C in a sample buffer that contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% mercaptoethanol. After cooling the samples, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue was added, and 1–1.5 μg of protein was loaded per lane. Novex gels were run with Laemmli buffer at 125 V for 90 min. PhastGels were run with PhastGel SDS buffer strips containing 0.2 m Tricine, 0.2 m Tris, 0.55% SDS, pH 8.1, and were electrophoresed using a PhastSystem apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), at 250 V, 10 mA, at 15 °C for 70 V-h. The separated proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. The molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) underwent the same treatment as the samples prior to electrophoresis. For Western blot analysis, the gradient gels were washed and equilibrated in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3) for 5 min and the proteins were blotted by diffusion for 2 h on nitrocellulose membranes (0.2-μm pore size; Protran™ from Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20, in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) for 30 min. The membranes were thoroughly washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS, and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody against macNOS (1/2, 500 in 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS) for 2 h. The membranes were extensively washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS, and subsequently incubated with goat antibodies against mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1/30,000; Bio-Rad) for 1 h. After washing the membranes with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS, the immunocomplexes were developed using enhanced horseradish peroxidase/luminol chemiluminescence reaction, detected with photographic film (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) recorded after 30 s to 7 min of exposure. The positions of various molecular weight markers (in kDa) are indicated in Fig. 1. A lysate of mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line, provided by Transduction Laboratories, was used as a positive control. Native PAGE was performed using 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels as described above, and the PhastGel native buffer strips containing 0.88 m alanine and 0.25 m Tris, pH 8.8. The proteins were loaded at 1–2 μg/lane and separated under the following conditions: 400 V, 10 mA, 2.5 watts at 15 °C for 120 V-h. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue.Measurement of NO⋅ ProductionThe reaction medium used to follow NO⋅ production contained 1 mml-Arg, 1 mm magnesium acetate (added only in crude preparations), 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm NADPH, 12 μm THB4, 10 mm CHAPS, in 0.1 m Hepes buffer, pH 7.5 (34Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and 0.05–0.5 mg of protein. If required, the equivalent of 50–200 nm FMN were added to the preparations. The enzyme activity was monitored by absorption spectrophotometry by following the controlled oxidation of oxymyoglobin as described in the accompanying article (29Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The oxidation of oxymyoglobin to metmyoglobin, sensitive to NMMA inhibition and in the presence of 1 μm superoxide dismutase and catalase, was followed at 581–592 nm in a double-beam spectrophotometer Hitachi U-3110 with a multiple wavelength program at 22 °C in the presence of 50 μm oxymyoglobin.Measurement of Superoxide Anion ProductionThe rates of cytochrome c reduction were measured by following the increase in the absorbance at 550–540 nm in a Hitachi U-3110 spectrophotometer with a multiple wavelength program. The reaction mixtures contained either 0.75 μg of cytochrome P450reductase/ml or 0.56 μg of purified mtNOS/ml, 20 μmcytochrome c, 0.2 mm NADPH, in 0.2 mpotassium phosphate buffer, without or with 10 μmCu,Zn-superoxide dismutase. The rates of O·̄2 production were calculated as the rates of cytochrome c reduction sensitive to superoxide dismutase inhibition (35Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. CRC Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radicals Research. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 213-215Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPurification of mtNOS from Rat Liver MitochondriaThe starting material for the isolation of mtNOS was a highly purified preparation of rat liver mitochondria. The isolation procedure (differential centrifugation (31Chance, B., Hagihara, B., Proceedings of the 5th International Congress in Biochemistry Moscow, Sissakian, A. N. M., 5, 1963, 3, 37, Pergamon Press, New York.Google Scholar), followed by Percoll centrifugation (32Hovius R. Lambechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijiff V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and washings with high ionic strength solutions (33Cohen N. Cheung C-W. Sijuwade E. Raijman L. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) yielded a preparation with high respiratory control ratios (4 to 6 with 10 mm succinate and 0.25 mm ADP; Ref. 29Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) indicating intact and functional organelles, and a low degree of nonmitochondrial contamination (1–4%; Ref. 29Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Using these preparations, a modified procedure for isolating mtNOS was developed.The purification procedure consisted of lysis of the organelles, followed by ultracentrifugation, solubilization of the enzyme with CHAPS, and separation by affinity chromatography (TableI). This procedure yielded a preparation with a specific activity of 250–350 nmol of NO⋅/min/mg of protein (inhibitable by NMMA) with a K m forl-Arg of 3 ± 0.4 μm. Although this procedure did not allow the assignment of the enzyme activity to a particular mitochondrial membrane, the finding of enzymatic activity in submitochondrial particles (29Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), the contribution of the inner membrane protein (80–90%; Ref. 36Schnaitman C. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) to the total membrane protein, and the small NOS activity (10–20%) observed in soluble fractions (matrix and intermembrane compartment), suggested that mtNOS was localized mainly in the inner membrane.Table IPurification of rat liver mtNOSFractionVolumeProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmlmgnmol/minnmol/min/mg−fold%8,500 × gpellet5560021823.61100150,000 × gsup4518013147.32.060.22′,5′-ADP-Sepharose1.10.2360–80250–35070–1003–10 Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE gels (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) performed with preparations following affinity and gel exclusion chromatographies resulted in a major band (Fig. 1 A). The molecular weight of this band, interpolated in a plot of R F versus log M r of protein markers (r = 0.98), was 125–130 kDa, similar to that of macNOS monomer (Fig. 1 A; Refs. 13Stuehr D.J. Cho H.J. Kwon N.S. Weise M.F. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7773-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar and 38Hevel J.M. White K.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22789-22791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified mtNOS was highly unstable, especially if frozen without glycerol,l-Arg, and tetrahydrobiopterin. The loss of activity could be explained in part by the occurrence of other bands of both lowerM r and intensity produced after several cycles of freeze-thawing, suggesting the presence of proteolytic fragments (data not shown). PAGE of the ADP-Sepharose concentrate performed under nondenaturing conditions resulted in a band of 230 kDa, thus indicating that the enzyme was dimeric under native conditions (Fig. 1 B).Western blotting analysis of the sample, performed with specific monoclonal antibodies to iNOS, demonstrated that mtNOS was antigenically related to the macrophage isoform (Fig. 1 C). No immunoreactivity was observed with monoclonal antibodies against either brain or endothelial NOSs.Characterization of mtNOS Enzymic ActivityCofactor Requirement of mtNOSmtNOS, purified in the presence of l-Arg and THB4 and later subjected to extensive dialysis, showed an absolute requirement forl-Arg, NADPH, THB4, and FAD (Fig. 2). (The sample was dialyzed using aM r cut-off membrane of 50 kDa against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol for 24 h with three changes of buffer in a volume ratio 1/4,000.) The strict dependence of the mtNOS activity on micromolar concentrations of FAD conflicted with the tight binding of this prosthetic group to NOS (as it is described for cytochrome P450 reductase, the homologous protein of NOS; Ref. 39Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). The reconstitution of the activity by FAD addition was explained by the presence of 1–3% FMN contamination in the commercial preparations of FAD, evidenced by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Thus, the supplementation of the enzyme with 5 μm FAD, which carried a contribution of 50–150 nm FMN, or the addition of purified FMN (at concentrations similar to those required for the other isoforms to exhibit optimal activity) were sufficient to reconstitute the enzymatic activity.Figure 2Requirement of cofactors for mtNOS's activity. mtNOS, isolated according to the purification procedure described under “Materials and Methods,” was dialyzed (main panel) or chromatographed (inset) through a Sephadex G-25 column. The requirement of cofactors was studied by omitting one compound at a time from the following reaction mixture: 1 mml-Arg, 0.1 mm NADPH, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 μg/ml calmodulin, 5 μm THB4, 5 μm FAD in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. The activities were monitored by the controlled oxidation of oxymyoglobin using 2–3 μg of enzyme/ml at room temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A dependence on free Ca2+ was observed when either Ca2+ addition was omitted or EGTA was added to the reaction mixture, resulting in 25% and 7% of the control activities, respectively (Fig. 2). A 70% loss of enzymatic activity was observed when calmodulin was omitted from the reaction mixture (Fig. 2). This indicates that, even under conditions of extensive dialysis, calmodulin was still tightly bound to the enzyme, thus suggesting that the enzyme may exist as a calmodulin-independent form under physiological conditions.Consistent with this possibility, when mtNOS was purified in the presence of l-Arg and THB4 and desalted through Sephadex G-25 chromatography (5-ml column, elution buffer 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol; Fig. 2, inset), the activity increased 30–40% associated with a variable dependence on exogenous THB4, Ca2+, and calmodulin in the assay mixture (Fig. 2, inset). It may be surmised that this partial dependence of NO⋅ production on Ca2+/calmodulin was related to the modified desalting procedure (Fig. 2).The instability of pterin-deficient and/or l-Arg-free enzyme over time was demonstrated by assaying mtNOS after storing the purified enzyme for 24 h at −80 °C. Supplementation of the medium with either 5 μm tetrahydrobiopterin or 20 μml-Arg recovered 30–40% of the original activity. However, longer storage periods under these suboptimal conditions led to a rapid decrease in the enzymatic activity.Cytochrome P450 Reductase-like Activity of mtNOSAll the isoforms so far isolated share 50–60% amino acid homology, diverging most in the calmodulin binding domain. They also exhibit a C-terminal domain somewhat homologous to cytochrome P450reductase, which has a reductase-like activity (39Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11374-11378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the similarities between NOS and cytochrome P450 reductase, it was interesting to study the NADPH-oxidizing activity and the production of O·̄2 by mtNOS and recombinant cytochrome P450 reductase.NADPH-oxidizing Activity of mtNOSmtNOS showed a cytochrome P450 reductase-like activity (superoxide dismutase-insensitive) in the presence of either cytochromec or dimethoxynaphthoquinone as electron acceptors (TableII). These rates were 4–14 times faster than the formation of NO⋅ (about 0.3 μmol of NO⋅/min/mg of protein), consistent with the values reported for brain NOS (10.2 μmol of cytochrome c 2+/min/mg of proteinversus 0.1–1.3 μmol of NO⋅/min/mg of protein; Ref.40Klatt P. Heinzel B. John M. Kastner M. Bohme E. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11374-11378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Negligible rates of NADPH oxidation were observed if Ca2+ and calmodulin were omitted from the reaction mixture (data not shown) indicating an absolute requirement for Ca2+ and calmodulin to exhibit this activity, in contrast with cytochrome P450 reductase activity. Compared with the activity of recombinant cytochrome P450 reductase under identical experimental conditions, the mtNOS showed 4–7 times lower reductase activity.Table IINADPH-oxidizing activities of cytochrome P450 reductase and purified mtNOSElectron acceptorNADPH-oxidizing activitymtNOSCytochrome P450 reductaseμmol NADPH/min/mg proteinCytochromec1.198.5Dimethoxynaphthoquinone4.016.5 Open table in a new tab Superoxide Anion Production by mtNOSAt suboptimal concentrations of l-Arg, porcine brain NOS generated H2O2 (41Mayer B.

The V-type ATPases are structurally similar to those of the F-type, having a transmembrane proton-conducting sector and an extramembrane catalytic sector.

Combined with high resolution Tricine-SDS-PAGE in the second dimension, the subunit composition, particularly with respect to small polypeptides, was determined. Two novel proteins, 8–9 and 9.2 kDa in size, were found in the membrane sector. Here we report the detailed analysis of the larger of these two polypeptides. Restriction enzymes and T4-DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs. Taq DNA polymerase was from Stratagene, and TA Cloning Kit® was from Invitrogen. Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit, [α-35S]dATP and Hybond N+ membranes were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ABI Prism™ dye terminator cycle sequencing kit was purchased from Perkin Elmer. The cDNA library from bovine adrenal medulla was a kind gift from Leonora Ciufo (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom). Human EST clone ID 143553 (GenBank™accession number R75754) was obtained from the IMAGE Consortium (18Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Bovine tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen several minutes after the death of the animal. The probe against human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was a kind gift from J. Altschmied (Physiologische Chemie I, Universität, Würzburg). Anti-subunit G1 antibody was kindly provided by Bill P. Crider (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). Chromaffin granule membranes were prepared according to Apps et al.(19Apps D.K. Pryde J.G. Sutton R. Phillips J.H. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The membranes (11 mg of protein in 1.5 ml of 10 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4) were solubilized at 4 °C by addition of 1 ml of 1.75 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 50 mm BisTris-Cl, pH 7.0, and 500 μl of 10% dodecyl maltoside. After 30 min centrifugation at 100,000 × g, 200 μl of 5% Serva Blue G in 500 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid was added to the supernatant. One ml of supernatant was loaded onto each of three 3-mm-thick preparative 5–13% acrylamide gradient gels for BN-PAGE (14Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). After BN-PAGE, the blue bands were excised and the native complexes electroeluted. About 300 μg of V1V0complex and 900 μg of V0 membrane sector were recovered from 11 mg of membrane protein. Triton X-114-extraction was used for enrichment of V0 and V1V0-ATPase (20Pérez-Castiñeira J.R. Apps D.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Chromaffin granule membranes (1 mg protein in 0.17 ml of 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4) were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and solubilized by addition of 50 μl 10% (w/v) Triton X-114. V0 and V1V0 were precipitated by a 15-min incubation on ice. After a 10-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the pellet was washed with 0.5 ml of 10 mm Na+/Mops, pH 7.2, and centrifuged as before. The pelleted proteins were solubilized by addition of 90 μl 1m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 50 mm BisTris/HCl, pH 7.0, and 21 μl of 10% dodecyl maltoside, and centrifuged again for 10 min at 100,000 × g. After addition of 10 μl of 5% Serva Blue G in 500 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 50 μl were applied to 10-mm gel wells for analytical BN-PAGE. After blue native electrophoresis, individual lanes were cut from the gel and processed in a second dimension by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic techniques, staining techniques, and densitometric quantification followed the protocols described previously (17Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 21Schägger H. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). V0 and V1V0 complexes were electroeluted from blue native gels, resolved by Tricine-SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Individual bands were sequenced directly using a 473A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems), or after various chemical treatments, e.g. cyanogen bromide cleavage, partial acidolysis by 80% formic acid (24 h at 37 °C), incubation in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and methanol (16 h at 37 °C) for partial deacylation (22Bergman T. Gheorghe M.T. Hjelmqvist L. Jörnvall H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), cleavage between asparagine and glycine (23Bornstein P. Balian G. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 132-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) by 3 m hydroxylamine, pH 9.6 (7 h at 37 °C), or cleavage at tryptophan (24Fontana A. Dalzoppo D. Grandi C. Zambonin M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) by 0.7% iodosobenzoic acid dissolved in 80% acetic acid (24 h at room temperature). For searching genomic data bases with amino acid query sequences, the TFASTA computer program of the Husar package of the German Cancer Research Center (Heidelberg, Germany) was used. Protein secondary structures were calculated using the ANTHEPROT program (25Mohana Rao J.K. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys.

PCR was performed in 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% gelatin, 200 μmof each dNTP, 0.5 μm of each primer, 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.8. The temperature cycle was as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, 70 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles and a single step of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. A third perfect match primer was deduced from this sequence: VATPB9.2a, 5′-GGG GCA TCG TCG GCT TCC TGG TGC-3′. The bovine cDNA library was then screened by PCR using the combination of primers VATPB9.2a and VATPB9.2n and the same temperature profile. Six pools, comprising a total of 1500 colonies, were taken as the template for PCR, and examined for the occurrence of a 106-bp PCR product. The positive pool was divided into subpools, and the procedure was repeated until a single clone (BVATPM9.2) was obtained. The insert from clone BVATPM9.2 was cut out with BamHI and cloned intopBluescript™ II SK(−). The new clone pBBM9.2 was subcloned by using the BstEII site at nt 69 and the XbaI site at nt 246. The insert of human cDNA clone 143553 was cut out with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned intopBluescript™ II SK(−). Clones pBBM9.2 and pBHM9.2 were sequenced in both directions. Total RNA was prepared according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). RNA was separated by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis using 5 mm sodium acetate and 0.1 mm EDTA in running and loading buffers, capillary-blotted on Hybond N+membranes (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and fixed by UV irradiation. DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming, and QuikHyb® solution from Stratagene was used for hybridization. A 900-bp cDNA was excised from pBBM9.2 withBamHI and used as a probe for M9.2. The probe against bovine V1V0-ATPase subunit c (proteolipid c), GenBank™ accession number J03835 (32Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.-C.E. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), was made by PCR using primers BVch 5′-TCA GCC GCC ATG GTC TTC AG -3′ and BVcr 5′-CGG CGA AGA TGA GGA TGA GG-3′. Using the bovine adrenal medulla cDNA library as a template, a 358-bp fragment corresponding to positions 190–547 of V-ATPase proteolipid c was amplified by PCR, tested by restriction analysis, and cloned into pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). Analytical BN-PAGE (Fig. 1) was used for separation of V1V0 holocomplex and free V0-membrane sector from solubilized chromaffin granule membranes (lane M), and from a fraction prepurified by Triton X-114 extraction/precipitation (lane P). The oxidative phosphorylation complexes from solubilized bovine heart mitochondria served as molecular mass standards (17Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 33Schägger H. Brandt U. Gencic S. von Jagow G Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). The molecular masses assigned to complex I and complex V are minimal values, inasmuch as the copy number of some subunits is not exactly known (35Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. Biochem Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 36Buchanan S.K. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The prominent band with an apparent mass around 440 kDa was identified as V0-membrane sector by the characteristic polypeptide patterns in two-dimensional electrophoresis, and by amino-terminal protein sequencing (see below). A faint protein band with an apparent mass of about 1000 kDa was identified as holo V1V0-ATPase. The position of free V1 sector is also indicated in Fig. 1, although the amounts were too low for detection in BN-PAGE (see below). Second-dimensional SDS-PAGE of lane M from BN-PAGE (cf. Fig. 1) revealed the characteristic polypeptide patterns of V1V0 holoenzyme and V0membrane sector. Additionally, minor amounts of free V1sector and some contaminating mitochondrial F1F0-ATP-synthase could be detected (Fig. 2, upper panel). F1F0 was removed by Triton X-114 extraction/precipitation (Fig. 2, lower panel). Using the migration distances of V1V0 (≈1000 kDa), F1F0 (≥550 kDa), and V0 (≈440 kDa) for calibration, the apparent mass of free V1 sector was estimated at around 500 kDa. Several staining maxima of the 14-kDa proteolipid c in addition to those at the positions of V1V0 and the major band of V0indicated the positions of minor amounts of V0 sector in higher oligomeric states. The molar ratio of V0/V1V0 in isolated chromaffin granule membranes was deduced from Coomassie Blue-stained two-dimensional gels by densitometric quantification of proteolipid c and 115- and 39-kDa proteins (data not shown). A 5-fold molar excess of free V0 sector over assembled holocomplex was determined (cf. “Discussion”). Variation of the detergent/protein ratio for membrane solubilization by ±50% had no effect on the V0/V1V0 ratio, which was 5.1 ± 0.3 (n = 5). Analysis of polypeptide composition by SDS-PAGE was performed directly from lanes of BN-PAGE (Fig. 2) and after electroelution of the complexes from blue native gels (Fig. 3). Direct application of the two-dimensional technique had the disadvantage that the protein amounts were limited by the maximum load applicable to the first-dimension native gel. The presence of the novel M9.2 and M8-9 proteins (apparent mass in SDS-PAGE of 13 and 8–9 kDa, respectively) in V1V0 holoenzyme could therefore be detected only with prolonged silver staining (data not shown). However, because subunits of V1V0 and V0 complexes appeared as clearly recognizable columns of bands in the two-dimensional gels, a smearing 75-kDa band could be easily identified as the only major contaminant of both complexes (Fig. 2). This contaminant was identified as dopamine-β-monooxygenase (GenBank™ accession no. P15101) by amino-terminal sequencing (data not shown). V1V0 and V0 complexes which were electroeluted from preparative blue native gels and resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3), revealed essentially the same polypeptide patterns as observed with the direct two-dimensional technique. However, at the higher protein loading, the low molecular mass bands in the holoenzyme now were easier to detect, and apparent molecular masses could be assigned using bovine bc 1 complex subunits for calibration (33Schägger H. Brandt U. Gencic S. von Jagow G Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The polypeptide number and masses in the 29–115-kDa range (37Peng S.-B. Crider B.P.

Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) have already been described, e.g. subunit G (48Crider B.P. Andersen P. White A.E. Zhou Z. Li X. Mattsson J.P. Lundberg L. Keeling D.J. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Peng S.-B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 199: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and M20 (50Nelson N. Klionsky D.J. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in the membrane sector. Anti-subunit G1 antibody reacted with the 15-kDa band of V1V0, but did not detect any protein of the V0 sector (cf. “Discussion”). The unidentified 16-kDa band of the V0 sector therefore was tentatively assigned to M20. Only one protein component running below proteolipid c in SDS gels, namely subunit F, has been identified so far (51Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Tsai S.J. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3324-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We could detect more components in this low molecular mass range; M9.2 protein with an apparent mass of 13 kDa, and M8-9 protein, represented by a stack of four bands in the 8–9-kDa range, were identified in the membrane sector and in the holoenzyme. According to the electrophoretic mobility, the unidentified 12-kDa protein was tentatively assigned to subunit F. Comparison of 10%, 13%, and 16.5% acrylamide gels led to the identification of anomalous migration behavior of some subunits, which is often observed with hydrophobic membrane proteins. The M9.2 membrane sector-associated protein had an apparent mass around 10 kDa in 10% gels, which shifted to 13 kDa in 16.5% gels. In 16.5% acrylamide gels (Fig. 3), the M9.2 protein appeared as a diffuse background to the sharp 12-kDa band, but the 15-kDa subunit G and the 16-kDa band were resolved. Subunit G and the 16-kDa band comigrated in 13% acrylamide gels, but the M9.2 and 12-kDa proteins were separated (data not shown). 13% acrylamide gels were preferentially used for the densitometric quantification of Coomassie stain intensities of V0 and V1V0 subunits, and for determination of their staining ratios relative to the M39 subunit (TableI). The stain intensities of M9.2 and M8-9 relative to M39 were almost identical in the V0membrane sector and in the V1V0 holoenzyme which indicates almost identical stoichiometries in V0 and V1V0. However, it was not possible to decide whether these proteins are present in stoichiometric or substoichiometric amounts, because Coomassie Blue staining intensities are not reliable indices of copy number. Subunit G and proteolipid c in the holoenzyme had comparable stain intensities, which might also indicate a higher copy number for subunit G.Table IRatios of Coomassie stain intensities of V 0 and V 1 V 0 subunitsSubunitkDaStaining ratios of subunits of V0(n = 5)Staining ratios of subunits of V1V0 (n = 5)M11596.30.72 ± 0.140.40 ± 0.09A68.51.95 ± 0.13B56.62.69 ± 0.07M4525.40.94 ± 0.111.17 ± 0.28C440.88 ± 0.04M39391.001.00D + E26.1 + 28.31.68 ± 0.08M20*161.42 ± 0.10(0.97 ± 0.19)G13.7(3.67 ± 0.67)Proteolipid c15.73.48 ± 0.52(3.02 ± 0.55)F*12.51.10 ± 0.14M9.29.20.41 ± 0.050.48 ± 0.07M8–990.67 ± 0.100.62 ± 0.10 Open table in a new tab The complexes resolved by preparative BN-PAGE were electroeluted, and the protein subunits resolved by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes for direct amino-terminal protein sequencing (Fig. 4).

However, more than 90% of proteolipid c appeared to be amino-terminally blocked, because the signal intensities of phenylthiohydantoin amino acids from cyanogen bromide fragments were up to 10-fold higher than after direct sequencing. The novel M9.2 and M8-9 proteins were also directly accessible to Edman degradation (cf. TableII). The amino-terminal sequences obtained from the four bands of the M8-9 protein (Fig. 3) suggested that M8-9 might be present in a “full length” form (largest band 1) and three amino-terminally shortened forms (smaller bands 2–4).Table IIPartial sequences of proteins associated with V 0ProteinAssignmentSample preparationAmino acid sequencesSimilarity toAccession no.kDa115M115Partial acidolysis2-aFragments were not separated.

Exposure to more severe levels of oxidative stress, from these same agents, causes further inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aconitase but actually decreases its proteolytic breakdown by proteasome. It should be noted that the superoxide and nitric oxide liberated by SIN-1 decomposition react to form a steady flux of peroxynitrite.S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, a compound that liberates nitric oxide alone, causes only a small loss of aconitase activity (25% or less) and has no effect on the proteolytic susceptibility of the enzyme. Proteasome also seems to be the main protease in cell lysates that can degrade aconitase after it has been oxidatively modified by exposure to peroxynitrite, SIN-1, or hydrogen peroxide. Using cell lysates isolated from K562 cells treated for several days with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to the initiation codon region of the C2 subunit of proteasome (a treatment which diminishes proteasome activity by 50–60%), the enhanced degradation of moderately damaged aconitase was essentially abolished. Other model proteins as well as complex mixtures of proteins, such as cell lysates, also exhibit enhanced proteolytic susceptibility after moderate SIN-1 treatment. Therefore we conclude that peroxynitrite reacts readily with proteins and that mild modification by peroxynitrite results in selective recognition and degradation by proteasome.

Most of these studies revealed that the degradation of mildly oxidized proteins is a normal cellular function, whereas extensively oxidized proteins are poor substrates for proteases and may accumulate and, therefore, contribute to diseases or aging processes (1Davies K.J.A.

Nitric oxide and other nitrogen-based oxidants are produced by a variety of mammalian cells, including endothelial cells, neutrophils, and macrophages (22Rosen G.M. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In particular the reaction of nitric oxide with mitochondrial aconitase in various cells, and the reaction with cytosolic aconitase, also called the iron-responsive element-binding protein, or iron-responsive protein-1, have been intensively investigated (30Hausladen A.

Although NO is a relatively weak oxidant, it is able to react very rapidly with superoxide anion radical to form the strongly oxidizing product peroxynitrite (36Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radic. Res.

Peroxynitrite reacts with tyrosine residues of proteins, with sugars, and with DNA, and can also initiate membrane lipid peroxidation (25Beckmann J.S. Beckmann T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A.

In recent papers it has been demonstrated that aconitase, mitochondrial electron transport components, and mitochondrial ATPase are damaged by ONOO−(41Radi R. Rodriguez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Whether NO also exhibits some effects on aconitase activity is not completely clear, because Hausladen and Fridovich (30Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Castroet al. (31Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found aconitase to be stable toward NO, whereas Drapier et al. (34Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kuhn L.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) found an inactivation by NO. Stadleret al. (33Stadler J. Billiar T. Curran R. Stuehr D. Ochoa J. Simmons R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 260: C910-C916Crossref Google Scholar) described an inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase, whereas they found the cytosolic enzyme to be stable to NO treatment.We undertook the present investigation to test whether inhibition of aconitase by various nitrogen related oxidants is also accompanied by an increase in proteolytic degradation by proteasome. Therefore we exposed aconitase to various oxidants and investigated both the enzymatic activity and the proteolytic susceptibility of the oxidized protein. To test whether oxidation by nitrogen related oxidants, and the resulting enhanced proteolytic susceptibility of oxidized proteins is a more general process, we also used various other purified proteins as substrates for protein oxidation and proteolysis. Finally we exposed the numerous proteins in centrifuged cell lysates to nitrogen-based oxidants and measured the proteolytic susceptibility of the oxidatively modified protein mixture.DISCUSSIONA number of studies have reported the inactivation of aconitase by various forms of activated oxygen, such as the superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide (31Castro L.

Our own data show an inhibition of aconitase by moderately high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, which is in agreement with the results of Gardner et al. (47Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B.

We further find that oxidative modification is followed by an enhanced proteolytic susceptibility, which results in increased degradation of aconitase (as well as other proteins) by proteasome.The role of proteasome in the degradation of oxidized proteins has been demonstrated in a large number of studies from our laboratory (1Davies K.J.A.

Recently we were able to demonstrate that dividing mammalian cells in culture are able to degrade oxidatively damaged proteins preferentially and that the proteasome is mainly responsible for this activity (15Grune T.

J. 1997; 324: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar) in this regard. The present results even further extend our examples of both oxidants and protein substrates that appear to be involved in proteasome-directed protein turnover (recently reviewed in Ref. 51Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar).Studies of various model proteins have demonstrated in isolated systems that mildly oxidized proteins are preferentially degraded by the isolated 20 S proteasome, also called macroxyproteinase earlier by our group (4Pacifici R.E. Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 5Salo D.C. Pacifici R.E. Lin S.W. Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11919-11927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because this multicatalytic proteinase complex exists in both an ATP- and ubiquitin-stimulated 26 S form, and an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent 20 S form, it is important to note that oxidized proteins are preferentially degraded only by the ATP- and ubiquitin-independent form. In fact ATP actually exhibits a 10–20% inhibition of the degradation of oxidized proteins in cell extracts, and direct comparisons reveal that the 26 S proteasome (in the presence of ubiquitin and a fully competent conjugating system) appears unable to recognize the oxidized forms of various protein substrates (4Pacifici R.E.

Our current studies reveal, for the first time, that both ONOO−- and H2O2-oxidized aconitase is also a preferred substrate for proteolytic degradation by the 20 S proteasome.As reported previously (51Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), we suggest that polyubiquitin serves (at least in part) as a hydrophobic “tag” to target many soluble proteins to the 26 S proteasome and that ATP serves partly to de-ubiquitinate substrates and partly to activate their unfolding prior to degradation. Since oxidative inactivation generally causes some rearrangement of secondary and tertiary structure (partial protein unfolding) with consequent exposure of normally buried, hydrophobic domains (18Pacifici R.E.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), we suggest that oxidation essentially “replaces” both ubiquitin and ATP in activating substrates for degradation by the 20 S proteasome complex. As observed previously with other proteins exposed to other oxidants, aconitase is degraded most efficiently after treatment with moderate oxidative stress, whereas greater oxidative damage actually leads to decreased proteolytic susceptibility.The effects of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite on aconitase activity have been investigated by others (30Hausladen A.

Lancaster J.R. Corbett J.A. Goldman W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). More recently Yan et al. (52Yan L.Y. Levine R.L. Sohal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11168-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) reported the exciting new observation that oxidative inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase can contribute to age-related deterioration of mitochondrial function in houseflies. Furthermore, by experimentally inactivating or inhibiting mitochondrial aconitase, Yanet al. (52Yan L.Y. Levine R.L. Sohal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11168-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) were actually able to decrease housefly lifespans. These results indicate that oxidative inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase is an important biological process and suggest (to us) that efficient removal/degradation of the damaged enzyme may be an important first step in coping with the problem, assuming thatde novo synthesis of replacement aconitase can then occur.It has been reported that aconitase is one of the major intracellular targets of nitric oxide, and the loss of activity observed by some authors has been attributed to the reaction of nitric oxide with the iron-sulfur cluster of the enzyme. However, two recent independent publications by Hausladen and Fridovich (30Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by Castro et al. (31Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the data presented here, demonstrate that nitric oxide itself does not exert a major effect on the activity of aconitase. We now report that nitric oxide causes only a mild decrease in enzymatic activity and produces no significant increase in susceptibility to degradation by the purified proteasome.Bouton et al. (53Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19969-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated both disulfide bond formation at Cys437 and iron-sulfur cluster disruption in the peroxynitrite-mediated inactivation of cytosolic aconitase or iron-responsive protein-1. Earlier, the work of Hausladen and Fridovich (30Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that of Castro et al. (31Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) conclude that peroxynitrite exerts a strong inactivatory effect on aconitase. These results are in agreement with our own investigation of aconitase activity and our observation that aconitase is degraded more rapidly after SIN-1 or ONOO− treatment than is the untreated enzyme. Castro et al. (31Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is in good agreement with our own results (I50 of 75 μm). Castro et al. (31Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol.

The p50-binding site was localized to a subregion of SRC-1 (amino acids 759–1141) that encompasses the previously described CBP-p300-binding domain. In mammalian cells, SRC-1 potentiated the NFκB-mediated transactivations in a dose-dependent manner. Coexpression of p300 further enhanced this SRC-1-potentiated level of transactivations, consistent with the recent findings in which CBP and p300 were shown to be transcription coactivators of the p65 subunit (Perkins, N. D., Felzien, L. K., Betts, J. C., Leung, K., Beach, D. H., and Nabel, G. J. (1997) Science 275, 523–527; Gerritsen, M. E., Williams, A. J., Neish, A. S., Moore, S., Shi, Y., and Collins, T. (1997) Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 2927–2932). These results suggest that at least two distinct coactivator molecules may cooperate to regulate the NFκB-dependent transactivations in vivo and SRC-1, originally identified as a coactivator for the nuclear receptors, may constitute a more widely used coactivation complex."

Caspases are a family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, which pre-exist in the cytoplasm as single chain inactive zymogens (6Cohen G.M. Biochem.

They are proteolytically processed to active heterodimeric enzymes during the execution phase of apoptosis. Caspases may be divided into “initiator” caspases with long prodomains (caspases-8, -9, and -10), which activate “effector” caspases with short prodomains (caspases-3, -6, and -7), which in turn cleave intracellular substrates, resulting in the dramatic morphological and biochemical changes of apoptosis (6Cohen G.M.

To date, a family of at least 10 caspases have been identified, but it is not known precisely which of these caspase(s) are activated in vivo and which are responsible for the cleavage of particular substrates. Many of the caspases have overlapping substrate specificities, suggesting that there may be redundancy (6Cohen G.M. Biochem.

Relatively little is known about the subcellular distribution of the caspases. Caspase-1 is found predominantly in the cytosol (15Ayala J.M. Yamin T.-T. Egger L.A. Chin J. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. J.

Other caspases have been considered to be cytosolic, a conclusion based largely on data with caspase-1 and on the isolation and purification of caspase-3 (17Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A.

In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the differential subcellular distribution of specific caspases during the induction of apoptosisin vivo. Following Fas-induced apoptosis in vivo, active caspase-3 is found primarily in the cytosol, whereas active caspase-7 is associated almost exclusively with the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions.

These results support the hypothesis that during the execution phase of apoptosis, different caspase homologs cleave specific substrates in different cellular compartments. In this study 6–8-week-old (20 g) Balb/c males were used. All mice were bred in the Biomedical Sciences Department of the University of Leicester. Mice were injected either with 10 μg of purified hamster monoclonal antibody to mouse Fas (JO2) (PharMingen, Los Angeles, CA) (2Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T.

Animals were sacrificed at the indicated times by cervical dislocation. Livers were removed and fixed in 10% formaldehyde in buffered saline. Representative sections of the left lateral, median, and posterior lobes were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined for apoptosis. Following removal of the livers, excess hair and blood were removed by washing several times in buffer A (0.3 m mannitol, 5 mm MOPS, 1 mmEGTA, 4 mm KH2PO4). The livers were then chopped up and homogenized using a dounce homogenizer in 5 ml of buffer A supplemented with protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The crude homogenates were centrifuged at 650 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the resultant supernatant centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to sediment the mitochondria. The mitochondria were washed in supplemented buffer A and pelleted. The microsomal and cytosolic fractions were obtained following centrifugation of the 10,000 ×g supernatant fraction at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Purity of the mitochondrial, cytosolic, and microsomal fractions was assessed by Western blotting using antibodies to cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), glutathione S-transferase π (18Manson M.M.

Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis revealed that 77, 9, and 14% of total glutathioneS-transferase and 5, 93, and 2% of total cytochromec oxidase subunit IV were detected in the cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions, respectively. SREBP-1 was found almost exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 4 and data not shown). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out on liver fractions as described previously (22MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the p17 subunit of caspase-3 (kindly provided by Merck Frosst, Quebec, Canada) (11Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K.

Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to amino acids 470–479 of human SREBP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The proteolytic activity of the liver fractions was measured using a continuous fluorometric assay with benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp- 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Z-DEVD.afc) (Enzyme Systems Products, Dublin, CA) as substrate as described previously (22MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cleavage of Z-DEVD.afc releases the fluorescent moiety, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin, allowing the quantitative analysis of the proteolytic activities of caspases-3 and -7 (referred to as DEVDase). The agonistic Fas receptor antibody JO2 induced extensive liver damage and hemorrhage in Balb/c mice, with >60% of hepatocytes showing apoptotic morphology after 4 h (Fig. 1 B) (2Ogasawara J.

The caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD.fmk (50 μmol/kg) blocked Fas-induced liver damage and hemorrhage and dramatically reduced hepatocyte apoptosis to <1% (Fig. 1 C). Almost complete protection was still observed 24 h after exposure to the agonistic antibody (data not shown). The protection conferred by Z-VAD.fmk suggested a critical role for the activation of caspases in Fas-induced apoptosis in vivo, consistent with previous studies (24Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Ody C.

In order to confirm the involvement of caspases in Fas-mediated apoptosisin vivo, their activation was assessed by measuring DEVDase in crude liver homogenates from control and treated mice. This activity is primarily a measure of caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities, although there may be a minor contribution from other caspases (14Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M.

Treatment with the agonistic Fas antibody resulted in a marked increase in total liver DEVDase (270 nmol/min) after 4 h in comparison with that in controls (80 nmol/min). These results demonstrated the activation of the effector caspase-3 and/or caspase-7 in Fas-induced apoptosis in vivo in agreement with in vitro studies, which have shown the activation of these caspases following treatment of cells with Fas or tumor necrosis factor (11Schlegel J.

In order to further dissect the role of caspases in Fas-induced apoptosis in vivo, we examined DEVDase and caspase processing in subcellular liver fractions prepared from control and Fas-treated mice. Fas treatment induced 11-, 21-, and 23-fold increases in total DEVDase in cytosolic, microsomal, and mitochondrial fractions, respectively. In all cases, Z-VAD.fmk markedly inhibited the increases in DEVDase. Thus Z-VAD.fmk blocked apoptosis either by directly inhibiting the activity of caspases-3 and -7 or by inhibiting an upstream caspase, such as caspase-8. Caspase-3 is generally present in control cells as an inactive p32 zymogen (11Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.-T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

On induction of apoptosis, it is initially processed at Asp-175 between the large and small subunits, yielding a p20 subunit, which is further processed at Asp-9 and Asp-28 to yield p19 and p17 large subunits, respectively (17Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

In control mice, procaspase-3 was present in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2, lane 3) with none detected in the mitochondrial or microsomal fractions (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 6). Following treatment with the Fas antibody, complete processing of procaspase-3 together with the appearance of its catalytically active p17 subunit was observed in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2, lane 4). In addition, immunologically reactive fragments of ∼29 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes 3–7) and ∼25 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 4) were also observed. The ∼p29 fragment was observed in all the cytosolic and microsomal fractions (Fig. 2,lanes 3–7). While the identity of this fragment is not known, it has been proposed to be due to processing of caspase-3 following cleavage at Asp-28, yielding a zymogen, which is not further processed to active caspase-3 (23Boulakia C.A. Chen G. Ng F.W.H. Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Poirier G.G. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with Z-VAD.fmk resulted in almost complete inhibition of the processing of procaspase-3, formation of the p17 large subunit, and the p25 fragment (Fig. 2,lane 5). Inhibition of caspase-3 processing was also accompanied by the appearance of a very small amount of an ∼p19 fragment (Fig. 2, lane 5), which may be attributed either to irreversible binding of Z-VAD.fmk to the p17 subunit or to partial blocking of the processing of the large subunit (22MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 31Polverino A.J. Patterson S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7013-7021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The p17 subunit was detected primarily in the cytosolic fraction of livers from Fas-treated mice (Fig. 2, lane 4) with little if any being present in any other fraction (Fig. 2). These data demonstrate that following Fas induction of apoptosis, active caspase-3 is located primarily in the cytosol. Caspase-7 exists as an inactive p35 zymogen in control cells (22MacFarlane M.

J. 1997; 322: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On induction of apoptosis it is activated by initial processing at Asp 198 between the large and small subunits followed by cleavage at Asp-23 to yield the catalytically active p19 large subunit (22MacFarlane M.

He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In livers from control mice, caspase-7 was present as an unprocessed p35 proform in both the cytosolic and microsomal fractions with no detectable p19 subunit (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 7). While caspase-7 has previously been detected in the cytoplasm of Jurkat cells (28Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), this is the first time it has also been recognized to have a microsomal location. No detectable procaspase-7 or p19 subunit was present in the mitochondrial fraction from control mouse livers (Fig. 3, lane 1). Following treatment with the Fas antibody, complete processing of procaspase-7 was observed in both the cytosolic and microsomal fractions (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 8). Although complete processing of caspase-7 was observed in the cytosolic fraction, little if any p19 subunit was detected (Fig. 3, lane 5). However, the p19 catalytically active large subunit of caspase-7 was clearly detected in both the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 8). It was very unlikely that the p19 fragment in the mitochondrial fraction was due to microsomal contamination, because the endoplasmic reticular protein SREBP-1 was located exclusively in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 4 and data not shown). In addition, the uncharacterized p29 band, detected using the caspase-3 antibody, in the microsomal fraction from control or Fas-treated livers (Fig. 2,lanes 6 and 7) was not present in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The amount of the large p19 subunit of caspase-7 in the microsomal fraction following Fas-induced apoptosis was greater than the amount of procaspase-7 in control liver microsomes (Fig. 3, compare lanes 7 and 8). These results suggested that caspase-7 was translocated from the cytosol to the microsomes following its catalytic activation by an initiator caspase. The data clearly demonstrate that following Fas induction of apoptosis in mouse liver, caspase-7 is completely processed to its catalytically active p19 subunit, which is found primarily in the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions with little if any remaining in the cytosol. Z-VAD.fmk completely inhibited the Fas-induced cleavage of procaspase-7 as well as the formation of the p19 subunit in all subcellular fractions (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 6, and 9). Z-VAD.fmk also blocked the appearance of an uncharacterized ∼p32 fragment in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 3, lane 9). Taken together with the caspase-3 results, our data suggest that Z-VAD.fmk blocks the processing of both caspase-3 and caspase-7. Although it is not known precisely which caspase activates caspase-3 and caspase-7 during Fas-induced apoptosis, caspase-8 has been considered the most likely candidate (3Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M.

Recent studies have demonstrated that procaspase-9 binds to Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1) in a cytochrome c- and dATP-dependent manner (33Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar,34Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). This complex results in the activation of caspase-9, which in turn cleaves and activates caspase-3 (34Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation of procaspase-7 is not known, it may be due to activation by caspase-8 (5Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) or to a mechanism involving Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 (34Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar), but it does not appear to be due to a direct activation by caspase-3 (35Hirata H. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Yonehara S. Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto K. Sasada M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Although activation of caspase-8 is clearly a very early event following Fas-induced apoptosis, it is not yet clear how this is related to the activation of caspases following mitochondrial damage with the subsequent release of cytochrome c and the activation of procaspase-9. Therefore, Z-VAD.fmk may exert its action by blocking the caspase cascade initiated by both caspase-8 and caspase-9. Further support for the hypothesis that different effector caspases are responsible for the enzymic activity in different subcellular compartments was provided by comparing the Western blot data with DEVDase. DEVDase in cells undergoing apoptosis is believed to be primarily due to activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 (14Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M.

Although the total DEVDase loaded onto the polyacrylamide gel from the cytosolic fraction (20 pmol/min) (Fig. 3, lane 5) was greater than that from either the mitochondrial or microsomal fractions (9 and 15 pmol/min) (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 8, respectively), the antibody to caspase-7 only detected the p19 large subunit in the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions (Fig. 3,lanes 2 and 8). This suggested that a caspase other than caspase-7 was primarily responsible for DEVDase in the cytosolic fraction. Most probably this was caspase-3, based on the data demonstrating that the p17 catalytically active large subunit of caspase-3 was primarily located in the cytosol (Fig. 2). Thus our results strongly suggest that the major DEVDase in the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions is due to caspase-7, while in the cytosolic fraction it is due to caspase-3. Taken together, our results suggest that following its activation, caspase-7 is translocated to the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions, where it is responsible for the cleavage of specific substrates in these distinct subcellular compartments. A recent study using an affinity label also noted differences in the pattern of active caspases in the nuclei and cytosol between two cell lines (36Martins L.M. Mesner P.W. Kottke T.J. Basi G.S.

Their results together with the present study raise the question about how different active caspases may be targeted to different subcellular localizations. Many previous studies have highlighted overlapping substrate specificities of caspases-3 and -7. For example, combinatorial studies using tetrapeptide substrates assigned virtually indistinguishable substrate specificities to caspases-3 and -7 (14Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

It has often been suggested that there is a redundancy for certain caspases, which may be due to the important biological function of this system in removing damaged or unwanted cells (6Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar, 7Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). However results with caspase-3 knockout mice, which exhibit normal apoptosis in most tissues except neuronal cells, indicate that some caspases may function in a tissue selective manner (37Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C.-Y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Alternatively our data suggest that, at least in some tissues, caspases with overlapping substrate specificity may exert their functions in different cellular compartments, where they catalyze the cleavage of specific substrates. To explore this possibility, we examined the fate of SREBP-1, one of the few endoplasmic reticulum-associated proteins known to be cleaved in apoptosis (21Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 38Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

SREBPs belong to the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family of transcription factors and are involved in the regulation of sterol metabolism (21Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). On the induction of apoptosis both SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 are cleaved by the hamster homologs of caspases-3 and -7 (38Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

In livers from control mice, SREBP-1 was exclusively associated with the microsomal fraction with none being detectable in the cytosolic or mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and2, and data not shown). Complete loss of the ∼125-kDa SREBP-1 was observed in liver microsomes obtained from mice treated 4 h earlier with the agonistic Fas antibody (Fig. 4, lane 3). The antibody to SREBP-1 detected the intact but not the cleaved molecule. The Fas-induced cleavage of SREBP-1 was largely prevented by Z-VAD.fmk (Fig. 4, lane 4). As active caspase-7 and SREBP-1 share the same subcellular localization, it is possible that in vivo caspase-7 is responsible for the Fas-induced cleavage of SREBP-1. However based on our present data and the contiguous nature of the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum, we cannot totally exclude the possibility that SREBP-1 may also be cleaved, at least in part, by caspase-3. We have clearly shown that following Fas-induced apoptosis in vivo, active caspase-3 was located primarily in the cytosol, whereas active caspase-7 was associated with both the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions. Our data represent the first example of the differential subcellular distribution of specific caspases in anin vivo model of apoptosis. We thank Drs. K. Cain, P. Carthew, and B. Nolan for their helpful advice."
https://openalex.org/W2071794599,"The metabolism of 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE), an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde generated during lipid peroxidation, was studied in isolated perfused rat hearts. High performance liquid chromatography separation of radioactive metabolites recovered from [3H]HNE-treated hearts revealed four major peaks. Based on the retention times of synthesized standards, peak I, which accounted for 20% radioactivity administered to the heart, was identified to be due to glutathione conjugates of HNE. Peaks II and III, containing 2 and 37% radioactivity, were assigned to 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nonene (DHN) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenoic acid, respectively. Peak IV was due to unmetabolized HNE. The electrospray ionization mass spectrum of peak I revealed two prominent metabolites with m/z values corresponding to [M + H]+ of HNE and DHN conjugates with glutathione. The presence of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenoic acid in peak III was substantiated using gas chromatography-chemical ionization mass spectroscopy. When exposed to sorbinil, an inhibitor of aldose reductase, no GS-DHN was recovered in the coronary effluent, and treatment with cyanamide, an inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase, attenuated 4-hydroxy-2-nonenoic acid formation. These results show that the major metabolic transformations of HNE in rat heart involve conjugation with glutathione and oxidation to 4-hydroxy-2-nonenoic acid. Further metabolism of the GS-HNE conjugate involves aldose reductase-mediated reduction, a reaction catalyzed in vitro by homogenous cardiac aldose reductase.

Incomplete detoxification of free radicals has been suggested to incite tissue injury and dysfunction associated with several disease states, drug toxicities and the degenerative processes of senescence (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4392) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that in addition to their well recognized cytotoxic effects, free radicals also participate in cell signaling and growth, and mediate apoptosis or programmed cell death (2Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 3Landers H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which free radicals affect cellular metabolism and function are poorly understood. In general, free radicals are highly reactive and short lived. Their high reactivity prevents long range diffusion, which paradoxically limits their toxic potential (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4392) Google Scholar). The biological effects of free radicals are, however, extensive, perhaps in part because they engender other reactive and stable oxidants. Several metastable products of radical reactions have been identified that can cause spatial and temporal extension of the initially local radical events. Of particular significance are α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, which are produced during β-scission of alkoxyl radicals derived from ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). These aldehydes are highly reactive and generated in high concentrations by peroxidative reactions of lipids and lipoproteins, and it has been suggested that they mediate and amplify the cellular effects of their radical precursors (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). In addition to lipid peroxidation, high concentrations of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes are also generated by other biochemical processes, for instance, myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of amino acids (6Anderson M.M. Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and oxidative modification of nucleosides (7Burger R.M. Drlica K. Birdsall B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these aldehydes are present in many food substances and industrial and environmental pollutants (8Feron V.J. Til H.P. de Vrijer F. Woutersen R.A. Cassee F.R. van Bladeren P.J. Mutat. Res. 1991; 259: 363-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), or they are produced in vivoduring metabolism of several drugs, e.g. cyclophosphamide (9Sladek N.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1988; 37: 301-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and felbamate (10Thompson C.D. Kineter M.T. Macdonald T.L. Chem. Res Toxicol. 1996; 9: 1225-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and toxins such as benzene (11Zhang Z. Goldstein B.D. Witz G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1607-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and could thus represent a significant component of several acute or chronic toxicological states. Accumulation of unsaturated aldehydes or their products has been observed under several pathological conditions, e.g.proteins modified by these aldehydes have been immunochemically localized to atherosclerotic plaques of humans and animals (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar, 12Yla-Hettula S. Palinski W. Reosenfeld M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and to lesions and neurons of patients with Alzheimer's (13Sayre L.M. Zelasko D.A. Harris P.L. Perry G. Salomon R.G. Smith M.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar) and Parkinson diseases (14Yoritaka A. Hattori N. Uchida K. Tanaka M. Stadtman E.R. Mizuno Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2696-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). In addition, these aldehydes may also be precursors or constituents of the age pigment lipofuscin (15Tsuchida M. Miura T. Aibara K. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1987; 44: 297-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Chen P. Wiesler D. Chmelik J. Novotny M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 970-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, high concentrations of aldehyde-derived DNA adducts have been found not only in animals exposed to carcinogens, but also in humans and animals even without carcinogen treatment (17Nath R.G. Chung F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7491-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), suggesting that these adducts may represent common background DNA lesions related to spontaneous carcinogenesis and aging. Metabolic and physiological alterations and structural modifications due to α,β-unsaturated aldehydes may be an important component of tissue injury and dysfunction due to several cardiovascular pathological states associated with increased formation of reactive oxygen species, e.g. atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion, or toxicity of anticancer drugs. While high concentrations of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes or their adducts have been detected under these states (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar, 12Yla-Hettula S. Palinski W. Reosenfeld M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Blasig I.F.

Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1360: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), a causal relationship between aldehyde toxicity and oxidative stress remains to be established. However, to assess their contribution to specific pathological states and redox signaling, it is essential to identify the metabolism of these aldehydes. Nevertheless, the biochemical mechanisms for the metabolism of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes are not well understood (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). In this communication we report on the metabolism of the lipid-derived aldehyde, 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE) 1The abbreviations used are: HNE, 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal; HNA, 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenoic acid; DHN, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nonene; AR, aldose reductase; ARI, AR inhibitor; KH, Krebs-Henseleit; EIS, electrospray-ionization; MS, mass spectroscopy; GC, gas chromatography; CIMS, chemical ionization mass spectroscopy; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: HNE, 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal; HNA, 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenoic acid; DHN, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nonene; AR, aldose reductase; ARI, AR inhibitor; KH, Krebs-Henseleit; EIS, electrospray-ionization; MS, mass spectroscopy; GC, gas chromatography; CIMS, chemical ionization mass spectroscopy; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. in isolated perfused rat heart. HNE was used as a model α,β-unsaturated aldehyde since it represents more than 95% of the total unsaturated aldehydes produced during in vitro microsomal peroxidation (20Benedetti A. Comporti M. Esterbauer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 620: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). During oxidation of arachidonic acid for example, HNE is generated in 100-fold excess over malonaldehyde and glyoxal (21Mlakar A. Spiteller G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 79: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since it is a potent electrophile, HNE is one of the most toxic aldehydes generated during lipid peroxidation. It combines spontaneously with glutathione, and with cysteine, histidine and lysine residues of proteins, and displays a variety of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, HNE causes metabolic inhibition, thiol oxidation, and generates pro-arrhythmic changes in cellular excitability (22Bhatnagar A. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 293-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HNE-modified proteins have been detected in atherosclerotic plaques (12Yla-Hettula S. Palinski W. Reosenfeld M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and high concentrations of HNE have been measured in reperfused (18Blasig I.F. Grune T. Schonheit K. Rohde E. Jakstadt M. Hseloff R.F. Siems W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H14-H22PubMed Google Scholar) or Adriamycin-treated (19Luo X. Everovsky Y. Cole D. Trines J. Benson L.N. Lehotay D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1360: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) hearts. Bovine hearts were obtained from the local abattoir, rat hearts were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200–260 g. Human hearts were obtained within 6–8 h postmortum and kept frozen until use. NADPH, NADP, NAD, NADH, and aldehyde dehydrogenase were purchased from Sigma. Sorbinil (CP-45643; (+)-(4S)-6-fluorospiro[chroman-4,4′-imidazolidine]-2′,5′-dione) and tolrestat (Ay-27773;N-[[6-methoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1-naphthalenyl]thioxomethyl]-N-thiomethylglycine) were gifts from Pfizer and Ayrest, respectively. All the other reagents were of the highest purity available. HNE was synthesized as its dimethylacetal starting from dimethylacetal of fumaraldehyde as described previously (23Chandra A. Srivastava S.K. Lipids. 1997; 32: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For the synthesis of [4-3H]HNE the dimethylacetal of HNE was oxidized to the 4-keto derivative using polymer-supported chromic acid as an oxidizing agent. The ketone was reduced to the dimethylacetal of HNE by using tritiated NaBH4, and [4-3H]HNE obtained by acid hydrolysis was purified on HPLC. The [4-3H]HNE thus synthesized had a specific activity of 175 mCi/mmol. 1,4-Dihydroxy-2-nonene (DHN) was synthesized by sodium borohydride reduction of HNE. To a solution of HNE in methanol, 4 molar excess of NaBH4 was added, and the mixture was stirred for 60 min at room temperature. 0.1 m HCl was added dropwise to the reaction mixture to bring the pH to 2.0. The mixture was left in acidic conditions for 30 min (to decompose unreacted NaBH4) and was extracted three times with dichloromethane and purified on HPLC as described below. Radiolabeled DHN was synthesized enzymatically by incubating 60 nmol of [4-3H]HNE with 300 milliunits of human placenta recombinant aldose reductase (AR) and 0.1 mmNADPH in 0.05 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 0.4m Li2SO4. The reaction was monitored by following the decrease in absorbance at 224 nm. The enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration using an Amicon Centriprep-10, and DHN in the filtrate was purified on HPLC as described above. The identity and purity of DHN was established by NMR. 4-Hydroxy-trans-2-nonenoic acid (HNA) was synthesized by incubating 100 nmol of HNE ([3H]HNE) with 1.0 unit of aldehyde dehydrogenase, and 1.5 mm NAD in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. The reaction was monitored by following the increase in absorbance at 340 nm. The enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration and HNA in the filtrate was purified by HPLC. The conjugate of GSH and HNE was synthesized by incubating 0.5 μmol of HNE ([3H]HNE) with 3-fold excess of GSH and 0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 37 °C. The reaction was followed by monitoring decrease in absorbance at 224 nm. In 30 min approximately 90% of HNE was conjugated. After purification on HPLC, the conjugate was characterized by electrospray-ionization mass spectroscopy giving the pseudo molecular ion [M + H]+ atm/z of 464. The concentration of GS-HNE was calculated on the basis of amino acid analysis. For the synthesis of GS-DHN, 0.15 μmol of GS-HNE was incubated with 250 milliunits of recombinant AR and 0.1 mm NADPH in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 37 °C. The reaction was followed by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. In 30 min >85% of the conjugate was reduced. The reaction mixture was ultrafiltered and the filtrate was subjected to HPLC as described below. Synthesized standards and metabolites of HNE were separated by HPLC using a Rainin ODS C18 column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The compounds were eluted using a gradient consisting of solvent A (0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The gradient was established such that B reached 16.6% in 20 min, 41.5% in 35 min and held at 41.5% for 30 min. In an additional 10 min B reached 100%, and was held at this value for 20 min. For measurement of HNE metabolites, isolated perfused rat heart preparations were used as described before (24Bhatnagar A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized by an intramuscular injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg of body weight). Following anesthesia, the thorax was opened and the hearts were removed. Retrograde perfusion was started via a cannula inserted into the aorta. A modified Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution was equilibrated with a gas mixture of 95% O2 + 5% CO2, maintained at 37 °C, and perfused at a constant pressure of 100 cm water. The composition of the modified Krebs-Henseleit solution was (in mm): NaCl, 118; KCl, 4.7; MgCl2, 1.25; CaCl2, 3.0; KH2PO4, 1.25; EDTA, 0.5; NaHCO3, 25, and glucose, 10; pH 7.4. In control experiments, the left ventricular pressure was measured at 5 mm Hg, using an intraventricular balloon. After 10 min of aerobic equilibration, [4-3H]HNE (25–200 nmol, 65,000–520,000 cpm) in oxygenated KH buffer was injected through a side port in the cannula connected to the aorta. The coronary effluent was collected every 30 s for 3 min, after which perfusion was stopped, and the heart was removed, dissected into ventricles and aorta plus atria, and homogenized separately using a Polytron homogenizer in KH buffer diluted with an equal volume of 96% acetonitrile and 4% acetic acid at 4 °C. The final volume of the homogenate was 2 ml. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was extracted with dichloromethane, which was evaporated by bubbling nitrogen. The extract was reconstituted in a small amount of KH buffer. Aliquots of pooled perfusate (with maximal radioactivity) and the extracted supernatant of the cardiac homogenate was applied separately to an ODS C18column and the metabolites of [3H]HNE were determined by quantifying the radioactivity in each fraction. Individual peaks were identified by spiking with radiolabeled standards, and were further analyzed using ESI-MS or by gas chromatography-chemical ionization mass spectroscopy (GC/CIMS). ESI-MS analyses were performed on a Finnigan MAT TSQ70 triple quadrapole instrument upgraded with TSQ 700 software and a 20-kV conversion dynode electron multiplier. The Vestec ES Source (PerSeptive Biosystems, Vestec Products, Cambridge, MA) was modified as described previously by Emmett and Caprioli (25Emmett M.R. Caprioli R.M. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). ESI-MS operating parameters were as follows: needle voltage, 3.4 kV; nozzle voltage, 270 V; repeller voltage, 4 V, and source block temperature, 227 °C. To enhance source-induced fragmentation the repeller voltage was raised to 10 V, and bath nitrogen was introduced into the spray region at 3 p.s.i. Samples were diluted 1/10 with solvent (100/100/0.5 (v/v), methanol/water/acetic acid) and then introduced into the mass spectrophotometer using a Harvard syringe pump at a rate of 0.82 μl/min. Spectra were acquired at the rate of 275 atomic mass units/s over the mass range of 100–650 atomic mass units. All samples were derivatized with 10 μl of diethyl ether and 50 μl ofN-methyl-N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide for 40 min at room temperature. An aliquot (1 μl) of the mixture was utilized for GC/CIMS analysis. GC/CIMS analysis was performed using a Finnigan Incos 50 GS/MS system (Finnigan-MAT, San Jose, CA) fitted with a chemical ionization source held at a temperature of 150 °C using ammonia as the reagent gas. Gas chromatographic separation was achieved using a DB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm inside diamete, 0.25-μm film thickness, J & W Scientific, Folson, CA), which was held at 115 °C for 5 min, programmed at a 4 °C/min rate at 165 °C and then to 250 °C at a rate of 50 °C/min. The column was held at the final temperature for 5 min. Other parameters were injector, 270 °C, and transfer line, 280 °C. To avoid a large peak due to theN-methyl-N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide reagent, ammonia chemical ionization mass spectra were collected in the positive ion mode over a mass range from m/z 245–500 at a scan rate of 1 s/scan. All operations during the purification of the enzyme were carried out at 0–4 °C. Frozen bovine hearts were thawed and the larger blood vessels removed. The heart tissue was cut into small pieces and homogenized in buffer A (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) to make a 25% homogenate and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Prior to enzyme activity determinations, the homogenate was reduced by incubating with 0.1 m dithiothreitol for 60 min at 37 °C. Excess dithiothreitol was removed by a Sephadex G-25 (PD-10) column equilibrated with nitrogen saturated 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Aldose reductase was purified from bovine heart essentially as described previously (26Dale W.E. Hale C.C. Kim H.D. Rovetto M.J. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was monitored using 10 mmdl-glyceraldehyde and 100 μmNADPH in 0.05 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 0.4m lithium sulfate on a Gilford response spectrophotometer at 340 nm. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 μmol of NADPH oxidized per min. Homogeneity of the enzyme was established by the presence of a single protein band upon β-mercaptoethanol-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For Western blot analysis, antibodies raised against homogenous human placental AR were used. In our experimental set-up, isolated rat hearts perfused at a constant pressure of 100 cm water, developed a left ventricular pressure of 136 ± 3, and a systolic pressure of 141 ± 3 mm Hg. The mean heart rate was 339 ± 8 beats/min, and the coronary flow rate was 16 ± 0.7 ml/min (n = 29). The isolated hearts were stable, and 60 min of perfusion with KH buffer led to <10% loss in developed pressure. For studying HNE metabolism, however, no pressure recordings were made. An intraventricular balloon was not used because of possible interference with endocardial flow (27Das B. Srivastava S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, oxygen consumption in the perfused heart (without a balloon) is directly proportional to the aortic perfusion pressure (28Neely J.R. Denton R.M. England P.J. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), which might change in the presence of the balloon and could potentially alter HNE metabolism. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” 1.0 ml of [3H]HNE (25–200 nmol in KH buffer) was injected into the aorta. This concentration of HNE is too small to affect myocardial contractility or coronary flow (29van der Kraaij A.M.M. de Jonge H.R. Esterbauer H. de Vente J. Steinbusch H.W.M. Koster J.F. Cardiovasc. Res. 1990; 24: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In seven similar experiments, 64 ± 5% of the radioactivity injected into the aorta was collected in the 22 ± 3 ml of the perfusate. Approximately 8 to 10% of the radioactivity was recovered in the supernatant of the homogenates of the heart tissues. Upon HPLC separation of the metabolites present in the coronary effluent of rat hearts perfused with [3H]HNE, four peaks were evident (Fig. 1, I–IV). Total recovery in peaks I–IV averaged 74 ± 5% of radioactivity injected into the column. Peak IV (retention time, t R = 65 min), displayed a high absorbance at 224 nm, and co-eluted with externally added reagent HNE, indicating that it is due to unmetabolized HNE present in the sample. The amount of radioactivity recovered in peak IV averaged 29 ± 6% (n = 6; TableI). Peak II accounted for 1.7 ± 0.6% of the radioactivity and appears to be due to DHN, since thet R of this peak corresponded to that of enzymatically synthesized DHN, and this peak was co-incident with radiolabeled DHN.Table IDistribution (%) of HNE metabolites in the perfusates and supernatants of isolated rat heart perfused with [ 3 H]HNEPeakIIIIIIIV%Perfusate19.5 ± 2.11.7 ± 0.637.3 ± 5.829.6 ± 6.5Supernatant38.0 ± 5.53.8 ± 1.324.0 ± 2.126.4 ± 8.9 Open table in a new tab Peak III accounted for 37 ± 6% of the radioactivity (Table I) and co-eluted with HNA synthesized by aldehyde dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation of HNE. For further characterization, fractions corresponding to peak III (t R = 58 min) were collected, silylated, and subjected to GC/CIMS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 A shows the elution profile of peak III on GC. The peak was further identified by GC/CIMS analysis. The fragmentation pattern of the metabolite in peak III, as shown in Fig. 2 B, corresponds to HNA. To ensure that no DHN was present in this peak, chemically synthesized DHN was also sililated and subjected to GC/CIMS. Under the conditions used, DHN eluted on GC with a t R of 18 min (Fig. 2 C). As evident from Fig. 2 A no metabolite with a similart R was observed in the collected peak III. Peak I contained the most polar metabolites and represented 19 ± 2% of the radioactivity (n = 6). Thet R of these metabolites corresponded to the glutathione conjugates of HNE and DHN. To characterize the metabolites present in this peak further, the samples were analyzed by ESI-MS. For ESI-MS analysis, reagent GS-HNE was prepared nonenzymatically, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3 shows the electrospray mass spectra of GS-HNE and GS-DHN. The spectrum of GS-HNE exhibited three major peaks at m/z 464.0, 446.2, and 308.2, which were assigned as the [M + H]+ of GS-HNE and fragmentations due to loss of H2O and HNE, respectively. That the m/z 446 and 308 ions are derived from GS-HNE is substantiated by the observation that when the electrospray source repeller voltage (Vrepeller) was increased from 4 to 10 V to yield more fragmentation, there was an increase in the relative intensity of them/z 308 and 446 ions with respect to the m/z 464 ion (data not shown). For synthesis of reagent GS-DHN, GS-HNE was incubated with recombinant AR and 0.1 mm NADPH. After reduction, the enzyme was separated from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration, and the filtrate was further purified on HPLC using the gradient described above. The fractions eluting with a t R of 45 min were collected, dried in a SpeedVac, and used for ESI-MS. The only major peak observed in the ESI-MS spectrum of the product (Fig. 3 B) appeared at m/z of 466.3, which was ascribed to the [M + H]+ of GS-DHN (molecular mass 465). To ascertain whether GS-DHN and GS-HNE could be individually identified in a mixture, approximately 80% of GS-HNE was reduced by AR (as assessed from the decrease in NADPH absorbance). The product and the untransformed GS-HNE were purified as before and used for ESI-MS. The ESI-MS spectrum of the mixture showed two clearly separated peaks appearing at m/z 466 (GS-DHN) and 464 (GS-HNE). In addition, a peak due to GSH generated from the breakdown of the conjugates was also evident (at m/z 307). The ratio of GS-DHN and GS-HNE recovered as such (calculated from the m/z 466 and 464 peaks) was 1:0.2, which is comparable to the ratio expected on the basis of the percent conversion calculated from NADPH oxidation (data not shown). These measurements show that even though the difference in the m/z values between GS-HNE and GS-DHN is only 2, the two metabolites are clearly resolved by this technique, and that the ratio of 464 and the 466 peaks approximately reflects the relative proportion of GS-HNE and GS-DHN present in the sample. Fig. 4 shows the ESI-MS spectrum of peak I obtained from HPLC separation of the metabolites present in the coronary effluent of rat hearts treated with [3H]HNE. Peaks corresponding to GS-HNE and GS-DHN having m/z values of 464.0 and 466.1, respectively, are clearly evident and well resolved. The peak heights of the two conjugates are comparable, suggesting that roughly equal amounts of GS-HNE and GS-DHN are present in the effluent. A prominent peak was observed at m/z 446.3, which corresponds to the loss of a single water molecule from GS-HNE (also observed with reagent GS-HNE; Fig. 3 A). The peak atm/z 308.2 was also observed and was attributed to GSH, which presumably arises from the in-source fragmentation of GS-HNE. Other prominent peaks, observed at m/z 424.9, 430.9, and 486.2 were not identified. Notably, no significant peaks corresponding to GS-HNA (expected molecular mass of 479 Da), or GS-HNA lactone (molecular mass, 461 Da) were observed. Separation of the metabolites in the supernatant of the [3H]HNE perfused hearts also revealed four major peaks (Fig. 1 B). The total radioactivity recovered in the ventricles was 5 ± 0.6% (n = 3). An additional 4–5% radioactivity was associated with the aorta and the associated blood vessels. In addition, approximately 4% of radioactivity was associated with the acetic acid-acetonitrile-insoluble precipitate of the heart homogenate, presumably due to protein-bound HNE. Thus the total radioactivity remaining in the tissue was 12–16% of the administered dose. As in case of the perfusate, peak I contained a mixture of GS-HNE and GS-DHN, peak II displayed at R identical to DHN, and peak III was attributed to HNA and peak IV to unmetabolized HNE. The percent radioactivity present in each of these peaks is listed in Table I. A similar pattern of metabolites was observed when the heart was exposed to 24–200 nmol of HNE.

Nature. 1982; 295: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The extent of sulfation of a given metabolite is determined by the regulated expression of two enzyme classes: the sulfotransferases, which transfer the sulfuryl group, and the sulfatases, which remove it. PAPS appears to be the sole sulfuryl group donor in metabolism. The chemical potential associated with the phosphoric–sulfuric acid anhydride bond of PAPS is remarkably high (ΔG hydrolysis0′ ∼ −19 kcal/mol) (7Leyh T.S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 28: 515-542Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the sulfuryl moiety is well positioned energetically for facile and favorable transfer to its metabolic recipients. The chemical and regulatory parallels between sulfation/desulfation and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation are quite strong, yet relatively little is know about the chemistry and enzymology of sulfuryl transfer. The transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor (ER) is regulated by sulfation/desulfation at the 3-hydroxyl position of 17β-estradiol (E2). The binding of E2 to the ER, located in the nuclear membrane, elicits a complex cellular response that is rooted in the transcriptional activity of the ER·E2complex. E2 binds tightly to the ER (K d ∼ 1 nm) (8Merriam G.R. MacLusky N.J. Picard M.K. Naftolin F. Steroids. 1980; 36: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Gorski J. Shymala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 244: 1097-1103Google Scholar); E2S, on the other hand, binds weakly, if at all (10Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). Thus, the ER-binding activity of estrogen (and, in turn, ER activation) is regulated by E2 sulfation. The sulfation of E2 (Reaction 1), PAPS2−+E2⇌PAP2−+E2S−+H+(REACTION 1) is catalyzed by the enzyme estrogen sulfotransferase (3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate:estrone 3-sulfotransferase, EC 2.8.2.4). Recent studies indicate that the expression of this enzyme is causally linked to the estrogen-dependent growth response that is believed to underlie the genesis of epithelial breast tumors (11Falany J.L.

Human liver estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli K1 (13Falany C.N. Krasnykh V. Falany J.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

The equilibrium constant for Reaction 1 is determined, and the catalytic mechanism of EST is evaluated in initial rate and ligand binding studies.

Falany J.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and immediately used to inoculate a 100-ml culture of LB medium (15Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-433Google Scholar) containing ampicillin at 50 μg/ml. The pMBP-hEST-1 vector directs the synthesis of a maltose-binding protein-human EST-1 fusion protein, which can be purified by amylose affinity chromatography (13Falany C.N. Krasnykh V. Falany J.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The culture was incubated overnight at 37 °C and then used to inoculate 10 liters of LB medium toA 600 = 0.06. At A 600 = 0.6, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 350 μm. 3.5 h later, the cells were pelleted at 3500 × g for 25 min, suspended in 500 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 0.20 m KCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and frozen at −70 °C. All of the purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were thawed, and 1 liter of 4 °C lysis buffer (115 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.375 m sucrose, 0.375 mm EDTA, and 0.03 mg/ml lysozyme) was added. 20 min later, the cells were pelleted at 3500 × g for 25 min. The cell pellet was suspended in sonication buffer (5.0 mm KPO4 (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm DTT, and 57 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated. The cellular debris was pelleted at 27,000 × g for 60 min, and the concentration of protein, determined by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), was adjusted to 3.0 mg/ml using 5.0 mm KPO4 (pH 7.4). The protein solution was loaded onto a 100-ml bed (3.6 × 17 cm) of amylose resin and equilibrated with 5.0 mmKPO4 (pH 7.4). The column was then washed with 200 ml of wash buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4, 0.20 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm DTT, and 1.0 mmEDTA-HCl (pH 6.3)). The maltose-binding protein-EST fusion protein was then eluted from the column with wash buffer containing 10 mm maltose. 280 A 280 units of pure fusion protein was obtained. Glycerol was immediately added to the protein solution to 10% (v/v). Tris-HCl (1.0 m, pH 7.5) was then added to the protein solution to a final concentration of 25 mm. Factor Xa protease (0.66 mg/ml) was added to a solution of maltose-binding protein-EST fusion protein (A 280 = 7.0) to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. The Factor Xa cut site has been engineered into the fusion protein such that the proteolytically produced EST has at its N terminus its initiator methionine (13Falany C.N. Krasnykh V. Falany J.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The proteolysis was allowed to proceed for 4 h at 4 °C; the reaction reached ∼90% completion. The proteolyzed solution was then purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 (XK 27/70) column equilibrated with 10 mm NaH2PO4 and 1.0 mm DTT. The fractions containing EST were pooled, concentrated using Amicon Centriprep-10 concentrators, and rerun over the Superdex column to remove the remaining traces of fusion protein and maltose-binding protein. The EST was pooled, and the solution was made 10% (v/v) in glycerol. The sample was concentrated toA 280 = 1.6. The enzyme was aliquoted, frozen in a dry ice/EtOH bath, and stored at −70 °C. Under these conditions, the enzyme showed no significant loss of activity over the ensuing 3–4 weeks. The native molecular mass of EST was determined by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 (XK 27/70) column. The column was equilibrated and run in 50 mmK+-Hepes (pH 8.0) at 4 °C. Bio-Rad gel filtration standards were used to calibrate the column. The apparent native molecular mass of EST was 62 ± 2.3 kDa. The extinction coefficient of EST was determined gravimetrically at 280 nm, the λmax for the enzyme. EST was dialyzed at 4 °C for 8 h and then overnight against 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 6.3), 1.0 mm KCl, and 0.10 mm DTT. The absorbance of the dialyzed EST was determined in triplicate at 280 nm in a masked 1-cm path length cuvette. Dialyzed enzyme or dialysis buffer (200 ± 1.6 μl) was added to an aluminum weigh boat and dried under vacuum and over P2O5 to a constant weight (<40 h). Triplicate samples of the dialyzed enzyme and buffer were each weighed three times. The absorbance at 280 nm was divided by the concentration of enzyme to calculate the extinction coefficient: ε280* = 1.7 ± 0.1A 280 × (mg/ml)−1 × cm−1. The equilibrium constant for the EST reaction was determined at pH 6.3 and T = 22 ± 2 °C. The measurements were performed in duplicate at each of the following three sets of initial concentrations of E2S, [5′-32P]PAP, and EST, respectively: 100 μm, 240 nm, and 8.0 nm; 200 μm, 240 nm, and 8.0 nm; and 500 μm, 630 nm, and 32 nm. The progress curve for each reaction was determined, and the equilibrium constant was calculated from the reactant concentrations in the stationary phase of the progress curve. The buffer was the same as that used in the initial rate experiments. The concentration of product formed in each reaction was at least 10 times the enzyme active-site concentration. The equilibrium constant was (4.5 ± 0.2) × 103. The initial rate of the forward reaction was studied as a function of MgCl2 concentration. The assays were performed as described below under “Initial Rate Studies of the Forward Reaction.” The conditions of these experiments were as follows: 1.0 nm EST, 10 nmE2, 6.0 μm PAPS, 50 mmKPO4 (pH 6.3), 1.0 mm DTT, and 10% (v/v) glycerol at T = 25 ± 2 °C. The MgCl2 concentration was varied in 2.0 mmincrements from 0 to 11 mm. EDTA was added to 2.0 mm in the experiments at zero MgCl2 to ensure that the observed activity was not caused by trace divalent cations in the buffer. The reactions were initiated by adding 50 μl of enzyme to 200 μl of a buffered solution containing varying concentrations of E2 and PAPS. The buffer used in these experiments contained 50 mmKPO4 (pH 6.3), 7.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm DTT, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 950 μl of 10 mm KOH. (Controls were run to ensure that the KOH did not hydrolyze the E2S produced.) 5.0 ml of CHCl3 was then added, and the solution was vortexed for 15 s. 800 μl of the aqueous phase was removed and counted. Velocities were determined in duplicate under each of the 16 conditions defined by a 4 × 4 matrix of substrate concentrations. The concentration of EST was 0.10 nm in all of the experiments. The concentrations of PAPS (12, 18, 34, and 300 nm) ranged from 0.2 to 5 times its K m . The concentrations of E2 (2.0, 2.8, 4.8, and 15.5 nm) ranged from 0.4 to 3 times its K m . Partial substrate inhibition by E2 is negligible at these E2 concentrations. The velocities were measured under initial rate conditions since the consumption of the concentration-limiting substrate was <7% of its end point in all cases. The data were statistically fit to the sequen model using the program developed by Cleland (17Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). 5.0 μl of EST (4.0 nm) was added to 15 μl of solution containing PAP at varying concentrations and E2S at 250 μm. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 4.0 μl of 0.10 m KOH (final pH 10.0). 9.0 μl of solution was spotted onto polyethyleneimine-fluorescamine TLC plates. The radiolabeled reactants were separated using a LiCl (0.50 m) and HCO2H (2.0 m) mobile phase and quantitated using an AMBIS two-dimensional radioactivity detector. The experiments were performed at 25 ± 2 °C. The data were statistically fit to the hyper model using the weighted least-squares program of Cleland (17Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). These initial rate assays were performed as described above for the forward reaction. The concentrations of EST and PAPS were 1.0 and 600 nm, respectively. To determine whether inhibition was caused by changes ink cat or the K m for PAPS, the rates at the highest concentrations of E2 (i.e.the plateau region of the curve shown in Fig. 2) were performed at a 10 times higher concentration of PAPS (6.0 μm). Each velocity was determined in duplicate. The data were fit using a partial substrate inhibition model (see “Results and Discussion”) with the program Kaleidograph, which uses the Marquardt-Levenberg minimization algorithm. The EST fluorescence excitation and emission wavelength maxima are 275 and 340 nm, respectively. To avoid possible inner filter effects caused by the absorption of PAP and PAPS, a 285-nm excitation wavelength was used in all of the experiments. The highest nucleotide concentration used in the titrations (5.5 μm) corresponds to an absorbance of 4.7 × 10−4. This absorbance is ∼100-fold below the threshold where inner filtering begins to influence intensity measurements (18Ward L.D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The emitted light was detected at 340 nm in all experiments except those involving E2, which is weakly fluorescent when excited at 285 nm. In experiments involving E2, the emission wavelength was set at 360 nm. At this wavelength, the emission from E2 is negligibly low (<0.2% of the EST emission at an equivalent concentration). The solutions used in the titrations were thermally equilibrated and maintained at 25 ± 2 °C during the experiment. The buffer (50 mm KPO4 (pH 6.3), 1.0 mm DTT, 7.0 mm MgCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) was filtered using Gelman 0.2-μm Acrodiscs. The fluorometer used in these studies was a Perkin-Elmer Model LS-5B; the entrance and exit slit widths were set at 10 nm. The titration data were fit to a single-site binding model using the Sigma Plot program, which employs the Marquardt-Levenberg fitting algorithm. The single-site binding model is described by a second order polynomial. The data were fit to the appropriate root of this polynomial to obtain the best fit binding constants. The protocol of the titration experiments designed to determineK d differed from those intended to determine stoichiometry. The titrant in the K d experiments was a solution of EST and ligand in which the ligand concentration was ∼10 times the highest ligand concentration reached in the titration. The titrant was added to a concentration-matched solution that did not contain ligand. In the stoichiometry experiments, an EST solution that did not contain ligand was added to a concentration-matched solution that did. The apparent native molecular mass of EST, determined by size-exclusion chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”), is 62 (±2.3) × 103 Da. The subunit molecular mass, predicted from the DNA sequence of the EST coding region, is 35,123 kDa (13Falany C.N. Krasnykh V. Falany J.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, the native enzyme appears to be a dimer. The extinction coefficient of EST, determined gravimetrically, is 1.7 ± 0.1A 280 × (mg/ml)−1 × cm−1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The experimentally determined ε280* is identical to that calculated for EST from its amino acid composition and the ε280* of Trp and Tyr (19Wetlaufer D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (798) Google Scholar). In the absence of glycerol, the activity (i.e. the initial rate of PAP and E2S synthesis) of EST is stable for several days at −70 °C, and the half-life of the activity is ∼2 h at 25 °C. Glycerol (10%, v/v) prevents detectable deterioration of the activity over 3 h at 25 °C. The addition of E2 to EST in glycerol causes a rapid loss of activity (t½ ∼ 30 min). This E2-induced inactivation was prevented by the addition of DTT. At 1.0 mm DTT, the activity was not affected at a saturating concentration of E2 over 4 h at 25 °C. Thus, it appears that the binding of E2 potentiates an inactivating oxidation reaction that is suppressed by DTT. Most enzyme-catalyzed transfer reactions involving nucleotides require divalent cations. In these cases, the cations are often directly bound to the polyphosphate chain of the nucleotide. The mechanism of this activation appears to be due predominantly to the entropy reduction associated with the positioning of functional groups for reaction (20Herschlag D. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5172-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is interesting that while sulfotransferases catalyze transfer reactions that, in many ways, resemble phosphoryl transfer reactions, they do not require divalent cations for activity. They are, however, activated by divalent cations. A plot of the initial rate of the forward EST reactionversus [MgCl2] is bell-shaped with a maximum at 7.0 mm MgCl2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The initial rate at zero MgCl2 and 2.0 mm EDTA is 0.18 times the initial rate at 7.0 mm MgCl2. The buffers used in the mechanism studies described in this paper contained MgCl2 at 7.0 mm. To determine an optimum pH for the EST mechanism studies, the initial rate of the forward reaction was studied as a function of pH at subsaturating E2 and saturating PAPS concentrations. This condition maximizes turnover with respect to both theK m for E2 andk cat. The assay protocol was as described under “Initial Rate Studies of the Forward Reaction”, except for the following changes. EST at 0.50 nm and PAPS at 6.0 μm were used, and the pH of the buffer (50 mmKPO4) was varied in 0.4 pH unit increments between 5.4 and 7.4, inclusive, by mixing dibasic and monobasic solutions of KPO4. The pH rate profile was bell-shaped with a maximum initial rate at pH 6.3. The recent structure of mouse testis estrogen sulfotransferase implicates His-108 as a general base that abstracts a proton from the 3-hydroxyl group of E2, thereby activating it for attack (21Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Further pH rate studies will help to determine whether this residue contributes to the pH rate dependence of the EST-catalyzed reaction. To evaluate the energetics associated with transferring the sulfuryl group between PAPS and E2and to aid in the design of initial rate experiments, the equilibrium constant for the EST reaction was determined at pH 6.3 andT = 25 ± 2 °C (the conditions of the initial rate studies). The equilibrium constants were calculated from reactant concentrations in the stationary phases of reaction progress curves constructed in duplicate at three different sets of E2S and PAP concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Controls were run to ensure that the EST activity did not change during the experiments. The equilibrium constant is (4.5 ± 0.2) × 103. The ΔG 0 associated with thisK eq is −5.0 kcal/mol. It should be emphasized this apparent equilibrium constant does not explicitly include the proton and divalent cation dependences. To determine the kinetic constants for the forward reaction and to obtain a preliminary assessment of the order of substrate binding, a classical initial rate study of the forward reaction was performed. The initial rate was determined as a function of both E2 and PAPS concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results of this study are shown in Fig. 1. The pattern of the data is indicative of a sequential mechanism (one in which both substrates must bind to the enzyme before product is released). However, it does not rule out a ping-pong mechanism with an unstable enzyme intermediate. An equilibrium ordered mechanism is ruled out by the fact that the lines through the data of the 1/V versus1/[E2] and 1/V versus 1/[PAPS] (not shown) plots do not intersect on the 1/V axis (22Cleland W.W. Enzymes. 1970; 2: 1-65Crossref Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The kinetic constants obtained from this study are compiled in TableI. k cat (1.3 ± 0.08 s−1) and the K m for PAPS (59 ± 13 nm) are similar to those measured for other sulfotransferases (23Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Saito M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7645-7653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Duffel M.W. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11123-11127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K m for E2 is comparable to the in vivo concentration of E2, ∼1 nm (25Guerrero R. Montiel L.R. Cekan Z. Diczfalusy E. Contraception. 1975; 11: 169-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that the enzyme is optimized to perform at the physiological concentration of E2.Table IKinetic constantsKiKmkcatnmnmmin −1PAPS155 (±35)1-aThe numbers in parentheses refer to a single S.D. unit.59 (±13)E213 (±4)5 (±0.8)PAP38 (±0.8)Forward1.3 (±0.1)Reverse0.16 (±0.01)1-a The numbers in parentheses refer to a single S.D. unit. Open table in a new tab TheK m for PAP and k cat for the reverse reaction were determined in an initial rate study at a saturating (920 × K d ) concentration of E2S (250 μm). Controls were run to ensure that E2S did not inhibit the velocity at this concentration. The K m for PAP was 38 ± 0.8 nm, and kcat was 0.16 ± 0.0013 min−1 (Table I). The experimental protocol is described under “Experimental Procedures.” Given the technical obstacles associated with the unfavorable equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction and the relatively high K m for E2S, the order of substrate addition for the reverse reaction was determined with the equilibrium binding studies described below. The initial rate data shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that E2 inhibits the forward reaction. The fact that the velocity decreases to a plateau, rather than to zero, means that one or more of the kinetic parameters for the reaction are being titrated from one value to another as E2 adds to the enzyme. The inhibition experiment (Fig. 2, •) was performed at a fixed near-saturating concentration of PAPS (600 nm, 10 ×K d ). If the inhibition were due solely to an increase in the K m for PAPS, causing the concentration of the reactive form(s) of the enzyme to decrease, increasing the concentration of PAPS would drive the initial rates, at inhibitory concentrations of E2, back to the uninhibited levels. This, in fact, does not occur. Increasing the concentration of PAPS 10-fold (Fig. 2, □) had no significant effect on the initial rates at high E2 concentrations. Thus, it isk cat that is affected by the binding of E2 in these experiments. The K i for E2 was evaluated by fitting the data shown in Fig. 2 to the algebra that describes the kinetic behavior of the model shown in Fig. 3. In the model, all of the enzyme forms are saturated with PAPS. The kinetic constants V 1 and K m for E2 were obtained from the initial rate study of the forward reaction (Table I). V 2 was set at 0.18 nm/min, which is slightly below the plateau shown in Fig. 2. The data were fit to the following equation: v =V 1(1 + (V 2[E2]/V 1 K i ))/(1 + K m /[E2] + [E2]/K i ) (26Fromm H.J. Initial Rate Enzyme Kinetics. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1975: 145Google Scholar). This equation assumes that substrate binding is at equilibrium, which is plausible given the very low turnover of the enzyme. The value of K i that provides the best fit to the data is 80 ± 5 nm. It should be mentioned that the inhibition model was used to select the E2 concentrations used in the initial rate studies (Fig. 1) such that inhibition by E2 was negligible. The excitation and emission wavelength maxima for EST are 275 and 340 nm, respectively. The fine structure and λmax of the emission spectrum do not change significantly when substrates bind to EST; however, the intensity decreases 30–50% depending on the ligand. These ligand-dependent decreases in the quantum yield of EST provide excellent experimental handles to determine both the equilibrium constants and stoichiometry of the enzyme-ligand interactions. The stoichiometry of the enzyme-ligand interactions was determined in fluorescence titration experiments in which the concentration of enzyme active sites was >15 ×K d . At these enzyme concentrations, the binding isotherms have two linear regions. They are linear in the substrate concentration range 0∼0.4 × [enzyme] because virtually all of the substrate is bound to the enzyme in this range, and they are linear (with a slope of zero) at saturating substrate concentrations. The intersection of the lines extrapolated from these linear regions corresponds, on the [ligand]/[E] axis, to the stoichiometry of the ligand-enzyme complex. The results of these studies for each of the EST substrates are depicted in Fig. 4 (A–D). The stoichiometries of the ligand-enzyme complexes are 1:1 for all of the ligands except E2, which has a stoichiometry of 2:1. The binding of two E2 to each EST subunit strongly suggests that one of the binding sites is the catalytic site, whereas the other is the allosteric site that regulates the turnover of the enzyme (Fig. 3). Notwithstanding the possibility that these fluorescence experiments monitor the formation of nonproductive complexes, the independent binding of each of the EST substrates demonstrates that the mechanism of the enzyme is random sequential. The equilibrium constants for the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes were determined by fluorescence titrations in which the enzyme concentration was held fixed between 0.4 and 5 ×K d . The binary complex binding constants were determined by fitting the data shown in Fig. 5 (A,C, and D) to a single-site binding model. The K d values for the E·PAPS, E·PAP, andE·E2S complexes are 37 ± 0.3, 30 ± 0.3, and 271 ± 49 nm, respectively (TableII). The data associated with the binding of E2 (Fig. 5 B) are equally well fit using either a single-site model (K d = 26 ± 2 nm; shown in Fig. 5 B) or a two-site model that assumes no interaction energy (27Wyman J.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 223-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar) in which the dissociation constants are within an order of magnitude of one another and symmetrically disposed about the best fit K d predicted by the single-site model.Table IIDissociation constantsLigandKdnmPAPS37 ± 0.3PAP30 ± 0.3E2S270 ± 50PAPS/E ⋅E2S2-aThe slash separates the ligand from the binary complex to which it binds.20 ± 2.8PAP/E ⋅E222 ± 1.72-a The slash separates the ligand from the binary complex to which it binds. Open table in a new tab The formation of the ternary dead-end complexes was also investigated using fluorescence titrations (Fig. 5, E and F). The binding of PAPS to the E·E2S complex and of PAP to the E·E2 complex was monitored at a saturating concentration of E2S or E2. The data clearly demonstrate that both dead-end complexes form. The nucleotide dissociation constants for the E·PAPS·E2S and E·PAP·E2 complexes are 20 ± 2.8 and 22 ± 1.7 nm, respectively. Comparison of the binary and dead-end dissociation constants for PAPS and PAP reveals a slight binding synergism between the ligands in the ternary complex (Table II). These results corroborate the dead-end complexes implicated by earlier product inhibition studies with arylsulfotransferase (24Duffel M.W. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11123-11127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and strongly suggest that the mechanism of EST is Random Bi Bi with two dead-end complexes. Initial rate and ligand binding experiments have been used to investigate the catalytic mechanism of EST. The kinetic parameters for the mechanism were determined from the initial rate studies, which also suggested that the mechanism is sequential. Ligand binding studies were used to determine the equilibrium constants and stoichiometries of the enzyme-substrate interactions. The binding studies demonstrated that each of the substrates can bind independently to the enzyme and that two dead-end complexes can form. These results strongly suggest a Random Bi Bi mechanism with two dead-end complexes. The initial rate experiments revealed that E2 is a partial substrate inhibitor of the reaction with a K i of 80 ± 5 nm. The mechanism of the inhibition is partially delineated by the stoichiometry studies, which show that the enzyme contains two E2-binding sites/catalytic subunit, suggesting that the enzyme harbors an allosteric E2-binding site."

S. J., Björnstedt, M., and Holmgren, A. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 3479–3482). Here we have further analyzed the reactivity with the enzyme of DNCB and analogues with varying immunomodulatory properties. We have also identified the reactive residues in bovine thioredoxin reductase, recently discovered to be a selenoprotein. We found that 4-vinylpyridine competed with DNCB for inactivation of TrxR, with DNCB being about 10 times more efficient, and only alkylation with DNCB but not with 4-vinylpyridine induced an NADPH oxidase activity. A number of nonsensitizing DNCB analogues neither inactivated the enzyme nor induced any NADPH oxidase activity. The NADPH oxidase activity of TrxR induced by dinitrohalobenzenes generated superoxide, as detected by reaction with epinephrine (the adrenochrome method). Addition of superoxide dismutase quenched this reaction and also stimulated the NADPH oxidase activity. By peptide analysis using mass spectrometry and Edman degradation, both the cysteine and the selenocysteine in the conserved carboxyl-terminal sequence Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly (where Sec indicates selenocysteine) were determined to be dinitrophenyl-alkylated upon incubation of native TrxR with NADPH and DNCB. A model for the interaction between TrxR and dinitrohalobenzenes is proposed, involving a functional FAD in the alkylated TrxR generating an anion nitroradical in a dinitrophenyl group, which in turn reacts with oxygen to generate superoxide.

Müller F Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar), and a high resolution x-ray structure shows surprisingly large differences to the other members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family (8Waksman G.

Model P. Nature. 1991; 352: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, the subunits of about 35 kDa are smaller than the about 50-kDa subunits present in glutathione reductase from all species. Furthermore the active site cysteine residues of E. coli TrxR are located in the central NADPH domain and separated by two amino acids (Cys-Ala-Thr-Cys), in comparison with the active site in glutathione reductase which is Cys-Val-Asn-Val-Gly-Cys and located in the NH2-terminal FAD domain, suggesting convergent evolution (9Kuriyan J.

The structural features of TrxR from E. coli with a high specificity for its homologous Trx are also typical for TrxR from prokaryotes, lower eukaryotes like yeast, or plants (1Williams Jr., C.H.

The wide substrate specificity indicates an unusual structure of the active site, which is also demonstrated by the inhibition of mammalian TrxR by several drugs in clinical use including antitumor quinones (19Mau B.-L.

Recently, two proteins from transformed human cells having thioredoxin reductase activity, a 55-kDa subunit enzyme from a Jurkat T-cell line (23Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl.

A peptide sequence from the protein purified from the human T-cell line (23Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We have confirmed the sequence of the human enzyme and determined that of bovine TrxR peptides and a cDNA clone of rat TrxR (26Zhong L. Arnér E.S.J. Ljung J. Åslund F. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8581-8591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the selenocysteine residue, conserved between the mammalian species in the carboxyl-terminal motif Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly, is essential for catalytic activity (26Zhong L. Arnér E.S.J. Ljung J. Åslund F. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8581-8591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The mammalian TrxR amino acid sequence is highly homologous to GR and carries the identical sequence motif within the NH2-terminal FAD domain that contains the redox active cysteine residues of GR. The carboxyl-terminal motif with a penultimate Sec and a neighboring Cys residue is an elongation to the structure that is not present in GR, but is homologous to a Cys-Cys-containing elongation found in another related flavoprotein, mercuric reductase (26Zhong L. Arnér E.S.J. Ljung J. Åslund F. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8581-8591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The domain organization of TrxR is schematically depicted in Fig. 1. DNCB is an electrophilic compound used as a substrate in assays to determine glutathione S-transferase, which is involved in elimination of DNCB in vivo (27Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNCB is therefore also used in cell culture experiments as a GSH-depleting agent (28Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5974) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNCB has an established use as an immunomodulatory agent to provoke delayed-type hypersensitivity (29Ahmed A.R. Blose D.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1983; 119: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although proposed to function as a hapten, the mechanism of DNCB immunomodulation is not clear (30Schmidt R.J. Chung L.Y. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1992; 284: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To summarize our earlier findings, we showed that DNCB irreversibly inhibited mammalian TrxR with second order kinetics by alkylating the enzyme, but that TrxR had to be reduced by preincubation with NADPH for the alkylation to occur (31Arnér E.S.J. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3479-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Upon alkylation, an NADPH oxidase activity could be detected, which was about 30-fold increased as compared with that of the native enzyme, and no consumption of NADPH was seen under anaerobic conditions (31Arnér E.S.J. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3479-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that the nitro groups of the dinitrophenyl-alkylated TrxR are necessary for the induction of the NADPH oxidase activity, and we identify the residues alkylated by DNCB. DNCB, DNFB, DNCB analogues, IAA, and 4-VP as well as epinephrine bitartrate salt and SOD were purchased from Sigma. Mammalian TrxR was purified from human placenta and calf thymus as described (12Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentration was determined fromA 280 nm measurements (A 280 − A 340 = 0.7 mg/ml) or by the activity with 5 mm DTNB assuming that 1200A 412 units/ml corresponded to 1 mg of protein/ml and an Mr of 120,000, i.e, a specific activity of 22 μmol of NADPH oxidized per min/mg of protein in the DTNB assay (12Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 20 °C using a Zeiss PM Q3 or a Hitachi spectrophotometer with semimicro quartz cuvettes. Details of activity determination using selenite reduction have been given in a previous paper (16Kumar S. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). DNCB or analogues were used as stock solutions in 99.5% EtOH, and in all samples the same final volume of EtOH (1%) was added, also to controls. For analysis of inhibition and induction of NADPH oxidase activity, 40–150 nm TrxR was used with 100 μm amounts of the dinitrobenzenes or DNCB analogues, 50 μm IAA or 1 mm 4-VP. For determination of NADPH oxidase activity, oxidation of NADPH was followed at 340 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 6200 m−1cm−1 in calculations. TrxR was incubated with 200 μm NADPH in 0.50 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 20–60 min with electrophilic compounds at 20 °C, each sample was applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (NAP-5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and the enzyme was collected in 1.0 ml of buffer. The alkylated TrxR free from electrophilic compound in solution could then be further analyzed for enzyme activity. Nonalkylated TrxR treated in the same manner was used as control enzyme. Superoxide was followed by reaction with epinephrine (2 mm in both reference and sample cuvettes) under production of adrenochrome, with an increase of absorbance at 480 nm using an extinction coefficient of 4020 m−1cm−1 (32Misra H.P.

TrxR (75 μg, ≈1.3 nmol of subunit) was preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with NADPH (250 nmol) in 15 μl of 50 mmTris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Then 0.5 μl of 260 mm DNCB in ethanol was added to give 130 nmol (TrxR subunit:DNCB ≈ 1:100 molar ratio, 3% ethanol), and alkylation was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature. Then the sample was put on ice and subsequently run on a Fast desalting PC 3.2/10 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mmEDTA, pH 7.5, using the SMART HPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). To the alkylated enzyme guanidine hydrochloride (final concentration: 0.8 m) and 7.5 μg of Lys-C endoproteinase (Wako) was added, and the sample was incubated for 17 h at 37 °C, whereafter additional 2.5 μg of Lys-C endoproteinase was added and incubation continued for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Then peptides were separated by automated fractionation using the SMART HPLC system with a Sephasil μRPC C2/C18 2.1/10 column in a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (buffer A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (buffer B) using 100% buffer A for 6 min, a linear gradient to 50% buffer B in 120 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% buffer B in 3 min and finally 100% buffer B for 15 min. Peptides were followed at 214 and 254 nm, while dnp-alkylated peptides were identified by absorbance at 340 nm. Fractions with absorbance at 340 nm were taken to amino acid sequence determination using Edman degradation on a Procise Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) or to analysis using electrospray mass spectrometry with an AutoSpec OATOFFPD (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Yields at the individual cycles of the Edman degradation were as follows (in picomoles): peptide in fraction B, 4.7-4.2-5.7-13-7.3-29-11-10-9.5-6.5-<0.5-<0.5-<0.5; peptide 1 in fraction C, >50-16-15-11-3.4-6.2-7.9-8.8-6.3-2.6-6.2-8.8-8.2-10-8.1-6.4-7.2-4.1-3.1-6.8-3.6-1.5-<0.5->3; peptide 2 in fraction C, 0.6-3.4-8.4-3.4-0.7-1.1-1.9-6.3-1.0-1.6-3.7-0.5-1.8-1.2-0.8-1.7-5.3-3.6-<0.5-1.1-<0.5-<0.5-<2. Mass spectra were recorded over an m/z range of 1500–300 at a resolution of 4000 (10% valley definition). Multiply charged ions were observed corresponding to (M + 2H)2+, (M + 3H)3+, and (M + 4H)4+ protonated molecules (see Fig. 5). The help with the mass spectrometry of Dr. William Griffiths, Protein Analysis Center, Karolinska institutet, Sweden, is acknowledged. Prior to the mass spectrometry, the fractions from the HPLC had first been dried in a Speed-Vac and then peptides were re-dissolved in 10 μl of 50% methanol. Induction of an NADPH oxidase activity in mammalian TrxR upon alkylation with DNCB could be an effect due to the alkylation of the enzyme per se, due to specific properties of DNCB, or due to a combination of these factors. To analyze this, we compared the effects on mammalian TrxR of different DNCB analogues and of alkylating agents other than dinitrohalobenzenes. The well known alkylating agents IAA or 4-VP did not induce any NADPH oxidase activity, although TrxR was irreversibly inhibited, showing that only alkylation of the reduced enzyme was not sufficient to induce an NADPH oxidase activity (Table I). The DNCB analogues 3,4-DCNB, 2,5-DCNB, 4-chloronitrobenzene, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene neither inhibited TrxR nor induced an NADPH oxidase activity, whereas a second dinitrohalobenzene compound, DNFB, both irreversibly inhibited TrxR and induced an NADPH oxidase activity (Table I). The results indicated that specific properties of dinitrohalobenzenes were needed to concomitantly alkylate and induce an NADPH oxidase activity in TrxR.Table IInteraction of some alkylating compounds or DNCB analogues with mammalian TrxRCompoundInduction of NADPH oxidase activityInhibition of normal TrxR activityIrreversible inhibitionDinitrohalobenzenes DNCB+++ DNFB+++Other alkylating agents IAA−++ 4-Vinylpyridine−++DNCB analogues 1,4-Dichlorobenzene−−NA 1-Chloro-4-nitrobenzene−−NA 3,4-DCNB−−NA 2,5-DCNB−−NA Open table in a new tab Simultaneous incubation of TrxR with DNCB and 4-VP showed that the two compounds competed for the same site of alkylation. We found that, under the conditions utilized, a 5–10-fold excess of 4-VP decreased the DNCB alkylation of TrxR by about 50%, as illustrated by a 50% lower induction of NADPH oxidase activity at this ratio of 4-VP to DNCB (Fig. 2). After incubation with 5 μm DNCB and 900 μm 4-VP (a ratio of 180:1), almost all of the induction of an NADPH oxidase activity was blocked. It should be emphasized that in all samples shown in Fig. 2, TrxR was completely inactivated for its normal catalytic reactions, illustrating that a complete alkylation of the enzyme had occurred in all of the samples, but that only alkylation with DNCB induced the NADPH oxidase activity. We noted that high concentrations of DNCB seemed to further increase the NADPH oxidase activity of TrxR, indicating that also DNCB in solution could induce an NADPH oxidase activity. To further study this, TrxR was alkylated with DNCB, then desalted and analyzed for NADPH oxidase activity with addition of increasing concentrations of DNCB. This confirmed that free DNCB in solution could lead to an NADPH oxidase activity, and this effect showed classic Michaeli-Menten type kinetics (Fig. 3). TheK m for DNCB in this reaction was 0.21 mmand the maximal NADPH turnover dependent on DNCB in solution was 17 min−1. The induced NADPH oxidase activity of TrxR alkylated by DNCB but desalted and with no additional DNCB present in the solution was 4.5 min−1. Thereby the total maximal DNCB-dependent NADPH oxidase activity of TrxR (i.e. the sum of the inherent activity of the alkylated enzyme and that dependent on DNCB in solution) was 22 min−1 (Fig. 3). To confirm the possible formation of superoxide in the NADPH oxidase reaction, adrenochrome formation from epinephrine (32Misra H.P. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 188-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was followed simultaneously with detection of oxidation of NADPH, and the effects of SOD on this system were analyzed (TableII). It was clear that adrenochrome was formed during the reaction and that SOD could totally inhibit this formation, demonstrating that superoxide indeed was formed. The NADPH oxidation also increased when SOD was added, to twice the basal level when SOD had been added in amounts sufficient enough to dismute close to all of the superoxide formed, as indicated by the total inhibition of formation of adrenochrome (Table II). If hydrogen peroxide formed by the action of SOD or the decrease in levels of superoxide was the reason for the increased NADPH oxidation upon SOD addition is not clear and has to be investigated further.Table IINADPH oxidation and production of superoxide by TrxR alkylated with DNCBAddition to cuvetteAdrenochrome formation2-aDetermined by increase of absorbance at 480 nm using an extinction coefficient of 4020 m−1cm−1.NADPH oxidation2-bDetermined by decrease of absorbance at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6200 m−1cm−1.min −1None10.95.5+1.5 units of SOD5.88.2+ Additional 1.5 units of SOD1.910.9+ Additional 1.5 units of SOD0.512.2+ Additional 1.5 units of SOD0.312.12-a Determined by increase of absorbance at 480 nm using an extinction coefficient of 4020 m−1cm−1.2-1002 Determined by decrease of absorbance at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6200 m−1cm−1. Open table in a new tab To determine the site(s) of alkylation, DNCB was in the presence of NADPH added to native TrxR at a 100-fold molar excess for 20 min at room temperature,i.e. conditions that yield a fully inactivated enzyme but concentrations and time of incubation sufficiently low to avoid extensive nonspecific alkylation. The dnp-alkylated protein was then desalted, digested with lysine-specific endoproteinase, and peptides were separated using reverse phase HPLC. Three fractions were found to exhibit absorbance at 340 nm, indicating the possible presence of dnp-alkylated peptides (Fig. 4, fractions A, B, andC). These fractions were subjected to Edman degradation, where fraction A gave no amino acid sequence, fraction B contained a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal end of the enzyme, and fraction C contained two peptides from the interface domain of the enzyme (TableIII). When detection of phenylthiohydantoin-derived amino acids was changed to 340 nm at the Edman degradation of the peptide in fraction B, a peak of decreasing intensity was seen during the first 2–3 cycles (not shown), which indicated that the dnp group is lost from the alkylated amino acid(s) during Edman degradation, as has been suggested elsewhere in experiments with glutathione S-transferase (33Liu L.-F. Hong J.-L. Tsai S.-P. Hsieh J.-C. Tam M.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).

We report a method to engineer proteins with cell-membrane permeability. After a 12–amino acid residue membrane-translocating sequence (MTS) was fused to the C-terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST), the resultant GST-MTS fusion proteins were efficiently imported into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and other cells. To explore the applicability of this nondestructive import method to the study of intracellular processes, a 41-kDa GST-Grb2SH2-MTS fusion protein containing the Grb2 SH2 domain was tested for its effect on the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated signaling pathway. This fusion protein entered cells, formed a complex with phosphorylated EGF receptor (EGFR), and inhibited EGF-induced EGFR–Grb2 association and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation."

Although several cellular targets of HePC, e.g. protein kinase C and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, have been proposed, the mechanisms of HePC-induced anticancer activity are still unclear. Considering that the antiproliferative effect of HePC correlates with inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, which is tightly coupled to sphingomyelin biosynthesis, we tested the hypothesis that treatment of cells with the anticancer drug leads to increased cellular ceramide and subsequently to apoptotic cell death. In the present study, we showed that 25 μmol/liter HePC induced apoptosis. In further experiments, we demonstrated that HePC inhibited the incorporation of radiolabeled choline into phosphatidylcholine and at a later time point into sphingomyelin. This was confirmed by metabolic labeling of the lipid backbone using radiolabeled serine, and it was shown that HePC decreased the incorporation of serine into sphingomyelin by 35% and simultaneously increased the incorporation of serine into ceramide by 70%. Determination of the amount of ceramide revealed an increase of 53% in HePC-treated cells compared with controls. In accordance with the hypothesis that elevated ceramide levels may be the missing link between the metabolic effects of HePC and its proapoptotic properties, HePC-induced apoptosis was blocked by fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthesis.

In current anticancer therapies, most cytostatic agents impair cell division by cross-linking DNA (e.g. cisplatin or alkylating agents), disrupting the cytoskeleton (e.g.vinblastine), or rectifying the cytoskeleton (e.g. Taxol). In a new approach to cancer chemotherapy, the cell membrane was described as a target for cytostatic agents. It is known that alkyllysophospholipids possess antineoplastic properties in vitro and in vivo (1Berdel W.E. Andreesen R. Munder P.G. Kuo J.F. Phospholipids and Cellular Regulation. II.

Due to its amphiphilic behavior and favorable penetration characteristics, HePC was expected to be a good candidate for topical treatment of skin metastases in breast cancer patients.

Orfanos C.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated that inhibition of PC biosynthesis was paralleled by inhibition of cell growth. Interestingly, all biologically active phospholipid analogs contained a phosphocholine head group. Investigating hexadecylphosphoethanolamine and hexadecylphosphoserine (HePS), neither cell proliferation nor PC biosynthesis was inhibited (11Geilen C.C. Haase A. Wieder T. Arndt D. Zeisig R. Reutter W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 625-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In further experiments, inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of PC biosynthesis, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15), was shown to be the mechanism underlying the inhibition of PC biosynthesis for all different classes of phospholipid analogs tested so far. Incubation of cells with the different analogs reduced the active, membrane-bound form of cytidylyltransferase (8Geilen C.C. Wieder T. Reutter W. J. Biol.

It was shown that HePC inhibited incorporation of [3H]choline and [3H]serine into SM, thereby increasing cellular ceramide. Furthermore, using cell permeable ceramides and fumonisin B1, a potent, competitive inhibitor of ceramide synthase (20Merrill A.H. Liotta D.C. Riley R.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), experimental evidence was provided that HePC-induced apoptosis is mediated by an elevation of cellular ceramide. [methyl3H]Choline chloride (2.8–3.1 TBq/mmol), l-[3-3H]serine (1.11 TBq/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (185 TBq/mmol) were from Amersham (Braunschweig, Germany). Silica Gel 60 high performance thin layer chromatography plates and reagents were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Streptomyces sp. sphingomyelinase, phospholipids, and ceramide standards were from Sigma (München, Germany). The cytotoxicity detection kit (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), the in situ cell death detection kit, fluorescein, and the cell death detection enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Plus were from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany).sn-1,2-Diacylglycerol kinase from Escherichia coli was purchased from Lipidex, Inc. (Westfield, NJ). HePC was synthesized as described previously (21Geilen C.C. Samson A. Wieder T. Wild H. Reutter W. J. Label. Compd. Radiopharm. 1992; 31: 1071-1076Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and HePS was a gift from Asta Pharma (Frankfurt/Main, Germany). The purity of both substances was >95% as shown by high performance TLC. N-Acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) and fumonisin B1 were from Alexis (Grünberg, Germany). For quantification of radioactivity a radioscanner (LB 2821 HR; Berthold, Wildbad, Germany) was used. HaCaT cells (22Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3440) Google Scholar) were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.35 g/liter glutamine, 100 000 IU/liter penicillin, and 0.1 g/liter streptomycin in plastic culture dishes (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Media and culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Karlsruhe, Germany). Penicillin and streptomycin were from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Confluent cells were subcultured after detaching the cells with 0.1% trypsin, 0.02% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Unless otherwise stated, HaCaT cells were maintained in keratinocyte growth medium (KGM) for the duration of the experiments. KGM was prepared from keratinocyte basal medium by addition of 10 μg/liter epidermal growth factor, 5 mg/liter insulin, 0.5 μmol/liter hydrocortisone, 50 mg/liter bovine pituitary extract, 100 mg/liter penicillin/streptomycin, and 2.5 mg/liter Fungizone. Keratinocyte basal medium and supplements were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). 25 mmol/liter HePC and 30 mmol/liter C2-ceramide stock solutions were prepared in ethanol. A 25 mmol/liter HePS stock solution was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and sonicated for 2 min prior to use and a 10 mmol/liter fumonisin B1 stock solution was prepared in methanol. All stock solutions were diluted with KGM to give the final concentrations. Ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and methanol (vehicles) were added to controls and were present at 0.1, 0.1, and 0.5%, respectively. The addition of the vehicles did not influence viability or proliferation of HaCaT cells (23Geilen C.C. Bektas M. Wieder T. Orfanos C.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity of HePC was determined by the release of LDH from the cytosol of damaged cells into the supernatant. The LDH activity was measured in an enzymatic test. In the first step NAD+ is reduced to NADH/H+ by the LDH-catalyzed conversion of lactate to pyruvate. In the second step the catalyst (diaphorase) transfers H/H+ from NADH/H+ to 2-[4-iodophenyl]-3-[4-nitrophenyl]-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride which is reduced to formazan and the reaction product is quantified photometrically at 492 nm. The LDH assay was performed with the components of the cytotoxicity detection kit (LDH) from Boehringer Mannheim according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent HaCaT cells which have been equilibrated in KGM for 24 h were incubated in KGM supplemented with different concentrations of HePC or HePS. After incubation, the cell culture supernatant was removed and clarified by centrifugation at 2000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 5 min. 20 μl of the supernatant were diluted with 80 μl of KGM and transferred to microtiter plates. After addition of 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 2-[4-Iodophenyl]-3-[4-nitrophenyl]-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride, diaphorase, NAD+, and sodium lactate the samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, protected from light. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 1 mol/liter HCl, and the absorbance of the samples was measured at 492 nm. HaCaT cells were seeded in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at subconfluent (14,000 cells/cm2) densities. After an equilibration period of 24 h, medium was removed, the cells were washed with PBS, and serum-free KGM containing different concentrations of HePC or HePS was added. After 24 h, the number of cells was determined by crystal violet staining as described in detail previously (11Geilen C.C. Haase A. Wieder T. Arndt D. Zeisig R. Reutter W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 625-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis was measured using the cell death detection ELISAPlus from Boehringer Mannheim according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent HaCaT cells that had been equilibrated in KGM for 24 h were incubated in KGM supplemented with different concentrations of HePC or HePS. After 20 h of incubation, the media were removed and the cells were trypsinized using 250 μl of 0.1% trypsin, 0.02% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid in PBS. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and the cell suspensions were combined with the respective media. The cells were pelleted in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 5 min at 2000 rpm and washed with 500 μl of RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cell pellet was incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer (component of the assay kit) for 30 min at 4 °C, and the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Then, the cytosolic nucleosomes in the supernatant were detected using the cell death detection ELISAPlus from Boehringer Mannheim. For this, 20 μl of the probe were transferred to a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate, and 80 μl of immunoreagent containing 1 part biotinylated anti-histone antibody, 1 part peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA-antibody, and 18 parts incubation buffer were added. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the microtiter plate was washed three times with incubation buffer, and the amount of peroxidase retained in the immunocomplex was determined photometrically at 405 nm with 2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate) as a substrate. The specificity of the method was checked by the use of known inducers of apoptosis, such as cell permeable ceramides, and the results of the ELISA were confirmed by typical morphological changes of apoptotic cells seen at the ultrastructural level, e.g. membrane blebbing and condensation of the chromatin. Apoptosis leads to double strand DNA fragments, which can be detected by labeling of the free 3′-OH-ends with modified nucleotides in an enzymatic reaction. In the in situ cell death detection kit, fluorescein (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase is used to catalyze the labeling of the free ends of the DNA-strand breaks with fluorescein-containing nucleotides. The reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent HaCaT cells that have been equilibrated in KGM for 24 h were incubated in KGM supplemented with 25 μmol/liter HePC or 25 μmol/liter HePS. After 20 h, cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized. 100 μl of cell suspension were applied to a slide and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 rpm. The cytospins were dried for 30 min at room temperature, and the slides were put in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min. For permeabilization, 200 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0,1% sodium citrate were added to the cells and incubated at 4 °C for 2 min. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS and 50 μl of TUNEL solution were added to the cells. Then, the cells were covered with a cover glas and the slides were put in a humid chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) was added, and the cells were again covered with a cover glass. Finally, the cytospins were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. Incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline into PC and SM was measured as described previously (15Wieder T. Perlitz C. Wieprecht M. Huang R.T.C. Geilen C.C. Orfanos C.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Confluent HaCaT cells that had been equilibrated in KGM for 24 h were incubated in KGM containing 2 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline supplemented with different concentrations of HePC or HePS. After incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and freeze-dried. Lipids in the samples were extracted by a modified method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42382) Google Scholar) as described previously (15Wieder T. Perlitz C. Wieprecht M. Huang R.T.C. Geilen C.C. Orfanos C.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Then, 10-μl aliquots of the chloroform phases were taken for scintillation counting, and 15-μl aliquots of the chloroform phases were separated by high performance TLC using the solvent system chloroform/methanol/triethylamine/water (30:35:34:8, by volume). Radioactivity was quantified by radioscanning and phospholipids were identified by calibrating the scanner with PC and SM standards. For lipid quantification, all lipids were stained with a CuSO4 solution (156 g/liter in 8.5% H3PO4) by the method of Touchstone et al. (25Touchstone J.C. Chen J.C. Beaver K. Lipids. 1980; 15: 61-62Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and quantified by video densitometry. Staining was linear in the range 0.5–6 μg of lipid per band. The specific radioactivities of PC and SM were calculated from the radioactivity and the amount of lipid found in the corresponding bands. The incorporation ofl-[3H]serine into SM and ceramide was determined as described elsewhere (23Geilen C.C. Bektas M. Wieder T. Orfanos C.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Confluent HaCaT cells that had been equilibrated 24 h in serine-free minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Karlsruhe, Germany) containing 5% fetal calf serum were radiolabeled by the addition of 2 μCi/ml l-[3H]serine in the presence of different concentrations of HePC, HePS, or fumonisin B1. After incubation, medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and freeze dried. Lipids in the samples were extracted by a modified method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42382) Google Scholar). Then, 15-μl aliquots of the chloroform phases were separated by high performance TLC using the solvent system chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v), and radioactivity was quantified by radioscanning. Ceramide was identified by calibrating the scanner with known standards. Additionally, an internal, radiolabeled ceramide standard was prepared by incubation of serine-labeled cellular extracts with 0.1 unit/ml sphingomyelinase. The ceramide-bound radioactivity was measured as disintegrations/min ceramide/disintegrations/min total lipid, and ceramide-bound radioactivity of control samples was set as 100%. After radioscanning, the plates were developed using the solvent system chloroform/methanol/triethylamine/water (30:35:34:8, by volume) to separate SM from glycosphingolipids in the samples. The SM peak in the resulting radioscan was identified by the use of standard SM. Additionally, it was shown that this peak was digested by sphingomyelinase treatment. The SM-bound radioactivity was measured as disintegrations/min SM/disintegrations/min total lipid, and SM-bound radioactivity of control samples was set as 100%. Determination of cellular ceramide was carried out as described in detail previously (26Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Kolter T. Sadeglar F. Sandhoff K. Brossmer R. Ihrig P. Perry D. Orfanos C.E. Hannun Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using sn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase. Briefly, after incubation of the cells with HePC, lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42382) Google Scholar), and cellular ceramide in the samples was measured as described elsewhere (26Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Kolter T. Sadeglar F. Sandhoff K. Brossmer R. Ihrig P. Perry D. Orfanos C.E. Hannun Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Statistical comparisons were made in these studies with Student's t test. Due to its amphiphilic structure the cytotoxic effect of HePC might be a simple consequence of its lytic properties. On the other hand, it has been proposed that cells treated with HePC die by apoptosis (27Engelmann J. Henke J. Willker W. Kutscher B. Nossner G. Engel J. Leibfritz D. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 1429-1439PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the cytotoxic effects of HePC in our experimental system we measured the release of LDH from the cytosol of HaCaT cells after 4 h of incubation with different concentrations of HePC. As shown in Fig. 2 A, HePC did not induce LDH release at concentrations ≤25 μmol/liter. However, at 50 μmol/liter a significant increase of LDH in the cell culture supernatant of 390% as compared with controls was observed, indicating that the cells were lysed. To exclude lytic effects, HePC concentrations ≤25 μml/liter were used in the following experiments. Furthermore, the synthetic phospholipid HePS, which has been shown to be biologically inactive and nontoxic at concentrations ≤50 μmol/liter (11Geilen C.C. Haase A. Wieder T. Arndt D. Zeisig R. Reutter W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 625-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used in our studies as a negative control. As expected, HePS did not influence LDH release at concentrations below 50 μmol/liter (Fig. 2 A), whereas nonspecific permeabilization of HaCaT cells was observed when the cells were treated with 250 μmol/liter HePS (LDH release from HePS-treated cells was 664 ± 8% (n = 3) as compared with control cells). In further experiments, we tested the ability of HePC to induce apoptosis by determination of cytosolic nucleosomes as a result of apoptotic DNA damage (28Jarvis W.D. Kolesnick R.N. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Gewirtz D.A. Grant S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We could show that treatment of HaCaT cells with nonlytic concentrations of 7.5 and 25 μmol/liter HePC significantly increased cytosolic nucleosomes to about 240 and 450% of control, respectively, whereas the control phospholipid HePS did not induce DNA damage (Fig. 2 B). Since the procedure of the cell death detection ELISA depends on intact plasma membrane function of the cells, the increase of cytosolic nucleosomes clearly distinguished the apoptotic effect of HePC at concentrations ≤25 μmol/liter from its lytic effect at 50 μmol/liter. The apoptotic capacity of HePC was confirmed on single cell level by TUNEL staining. As shown in Fig. 3, control and HePS-treated cells showed only a weak and diffuse staining, with 2 ± 1% (n= 3) of the cell population being fluorescent (apoptotic), whereas treatment of HaCaT cells with 25 μmol/liter HePC significantly increased the number of fluorescent (apoptotic) cells to about 26 ± 11% (n = 3) of the cell population. The antiproliferative effect of HePC has already been well documented in different tumor models (29Zeisig R. Fichtner I. Arndt D. Jungmann S. Anticancer Drugs. 1991; 2: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and cell lines (11Geilen C.C. Haase A. Wieder T. Arndt D. Zeisig R. Reutter W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 625-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Unger C. Damenz W. Fleer E.A. Kim D.J. Breiser A. Hilgard P. Engel J. Nagel G. Eibl H. Acta Oncol. 1989; 28: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), including primary human keratinocytes (10Detmar M. Geilen C.C. Wieder T. Orfanos C.E. Reutter W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 490-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no data were available on the immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. As shown in Fig. 4 A, HePC inhibited the proliferation of HaCaT cells with a half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of approximately 3 μmol/liter, whereas the control phospholipid HePS had no significant effect. At the nonlytic HePC concentration of 25 μmol/liter cell proliferation was almost completely blocked (6% of control), confirming our assumption that the antiproliferative effect is not mediated by cell lysis. The antiproliferative effect of HePC was paralleled by its ability to inhibit the incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline into PC, thereby decreasing the specific radioactivity of PC in the presence of 7.5 and 25 μmol/liter HePC after 4 h of incubation by 58 and 71%, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Inhibition of PC biosynthesis was also observed after 20 h of incubation (Fig. 4 C), indicating that this metabolic effect of HePC persists over a longer period of time. Consistent with the experiments described above, HePS did not significantly reduce the specific radioactivity of PC as compared with the dimethyl sulfoxide control. SM is synthesized by the transfer of a phosphocholine head group from PC to ceramide, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme phosphatidylcholine:ceramide phosphocholinetransferase. Although the exact mechanism of the enzyme reaction remains unclear, more than 95% of overall SM synthesis is attributed to this pathway (31Spence M.W. Vance D.E. Phosphatidylcholine Metabolism. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 185-203Google Scholar). Due to this precursor-product relationship, biosynthesis of SM might be influenced by inhibition of PC biosynthesis. First of all, we measured the time-dependent incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline into SM and found that the percentage of label in SM increased with incubation time (after 4 h of incubation only 1.5% of total radioactivity were SM-bound, whereas after 20 h of incubation SM-bound radioactivity reached 5.7% of total radioactivity), indicating that the choline head group originates from PC. This time course was also observed when the cells were treated with HePC; whereas HePC had already inhibited PC biosynthesis after 4 h, incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline into SM was not significantly influenced after 4 h (data not shown). However, incubation of HaCaT cells with 25 μmol/liter HePC for 20 h decreased the specific radioactivity of SM by 52% (Fig. 5 A), whereas the control lipid HePS was inactive. From the specific radioactivities of PC and the radioactive counts in SM the actual synthesis of SM was calculated, and we found that 1.38 nmol of SM/106 cells were formed in control cells after 20 h of incubation and 0.81 nmol of SM/106 cells in HePC-treated cells (59% of control). In a second approach, we metabolically labeled the lipid backbone of sphingo"
https://openalex.org/W2134156839,"Binding of integrin receptors to extracellular ligands is a complex process involving receptor-ligand interactions at the cell-substrate interface, signals activating the receptors, and assembly of cytoskeletal and adhesion plaque proteins at the cytoplasmic face. To analyze the contribution of these elements to overall cell adhesion, we have developed a model system that characterizes the functional binding characteristic for adhesion receptors as the force required to separate the integrin-ligand bond. A spinning disk device was used to apply a range of controlled hydrodynamic forces to adherent cells. The adhesion of K562 erythroleukemia cells, a cell line expressing a single fibronectin receptor, integrin α5β1, which was uniformly activated with the monoclonal antibody TS2/16, to defined fibronectin surface densities was examined. Cell adhesion strength increased linearly with receptor and ligand densities. Based on chemical equilibrium principles, it is shown that adhesion strength is directly proportional to the number of receptor-ligand bonds. This analysis provides for the definition of a new physical parameter, the adhesion constant ψ, which is related to the bond strength and binding equilibrium constant and has units of force-length2. This parameter can be measured by the experimental system presented and is governed by the activation state of integrin receptors. This simplified model isolates the integrin receptor-ligand binding parameters and provides a basis for analysis of the functions of signaling and cytoskeletal elements in the adhesion process.

Specific receptor-mediated adhesion to surface ligands is a fundamental property of most cell types. This adhesion is essential to the formation of multicellular organisms and is tightly regulated during development (1Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 425-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Many pathological conditions, such as blood clotting defects and tumor invasion and metastasis, involve abnormal adhesion processes (2Albelda S.M. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 4-17PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding of cell adhesion is also critical to biotechnological applications and to the development of devices for medical implantation (3Park P.K. Jarrell B.E. Williams S.K. Carter T.L.

Early experiments focused on cell adhesion as a structural element required for the organization of cells in multicellular organisms, but recent breakthroughs have shown that adhesion is directly involved in the transmission of signals essential for cell proliferation and differentiation (7Streuli C.H.

The integrin family of heterodimeric receptors provides the dominant adhesion mechanism for most cells which adhere to extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin (Fn) 1The abbreviations used are: Fn, fibronectin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DPBS, Dulbecco's PBS; IgG, immunoglobulin G; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CD, cytochalasin D. and laminin (10Hynes R.O.

Many of these receptors have been cloned and sequenced, and their ligands have been identified (11Sonnenberg A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 184: 7-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Biochemical and functional assays have indicated that integrin-mediated adhesion is regulated through several mechanisms, including matrix deposition (12Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Morla A. Zhang Z. Ruoslahti E.

Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar), modulation of receptor-ligand binding affinity (15Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and cytoskeletal reorganization (16Lotz M.M. Burdsal C.A. Erickson H.P. McClay D.R. J.

For example, most adherent cells grown in culture use α5β1 integrin as the dominant receptor binding to Fn synthesized by the cells or exogenously supplied. α5β1 integrin binds to the RGD region in the 10th type III repeat and to the synergy site in the 9th type III repeat of Fn (18Akiyama S.K. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This receptor is generally expressed in an inactive or low binding form on cells that are in suspension or that have been recently trypsinized (15Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Receptor interaction with Fn results in an energy-dependent binding that may involve a conformational change in the integrin (15Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This binding also causes rapid association of the receptor-ligand complex with the actin cytoskeleton (17Choquet D. Felsenfield D.P. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Receptor clustering is followed by the association of a complex of cytoplasmic proteins that include structural proteins, such as vinculin and talin, and signaling molecules like ras, FAK, and MAPK (19Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 20Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Although these changes in conformation and clustering contribute to the overall adhesion, a mechanistic understanding of the specific contributions of these factors to receptor-mediated cell adhesion is still incomplete. The adhesive properties of adhesion receptors can be defined in terms of the force required to break the bonds between the receptor and its extracellular ligand. This is implicit in all adhesion assays. The most common assay consists of seeding cells onto substrates, washing “non-adherent” cells off, and counting the remaining cells. Although these wash assays have contributed to our understanding of cell adhesion, they are limited in their ability to provide well defined, sensitive physical measurements. Given the complexity of the adhesion process, analysis of the biomechanical and biochemical interactions involved requires the development of both a new experimental system for measurement and a new approach to the analysis of these adhesion interactions. Quantitative adhesion assays have been developed to apply controlled detachment forces through centrifugation (21McClay D.R. Wessel G.M. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although these methods have provided measurements of adhesion strength, the functional dependence of adhesion strength on receptor-ligand parameters remains unknown. Here we present an experimental framework for the analysis of receptor-ligand interactions involved in cell adhesion. Using a device that applies a well-defined range of hydrodynamic forces to adherent cells expressing a single Fn receptor, α5β1integrin, we obtained specific force measurements of adhesion mediated by α5β1 integrin-Fn bonds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cell adhesion strength increases linearly with the number of receptor-ligand complexes and is described by a simple receptor-ligand model. The receptor-ligand interaction is characterized by a novel experimental parameter, which represents the fundamental adhesion properties of the specific receptor-ligand pair under controlled experimental conditions and is governed by the activation state of the integrin receptor. K562 cells (ATCC number CCL-243) were obtained from A. Gerwitz (University of Pennsylvania) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin. TS2/16 and HFN7.1 hybridomas were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). AIIB2 and BIIG2 hybridomas were a gift from C. Damsky. mAbs were affinity purified from supernatants on protein G-Sepharose columns. Human plasma Fn and cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. Ethidium homodimer was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Glass coverslips were purchased from Bellco (Vineland, NJ). Sulfo-BSOCOES cross-linker was purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Lyophilized plasma Fn was reconstituted with sterile distilled H2O to 1 mg/ml. Glass coverslips were coated with Fn diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; in mm: 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 4.3 Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.5 KH2PO4, 0.9 CaCl2·2H2O, 1 MgCl2·6H2O) for 30 min at 22 °C and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. Adsorbed Fn was determined for different coating concentrations using Fn iodinated with the Bolton-Hunter reagent (NEN Life Science Products). Cell adhesion to adsorbed Fn was measured using a spinning disk device (30Garcı́a A.J. Ducheyne P. Boettiger D. Biomaterials. 1997; 18: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This apparatus consists of a disk spinning in large fluid volume (Fig. 1) and applies a linear range of forces to adherent cells. K562 cells were washed and resuspended in DPBS + 2 mm glucose. Cells (400 cells/mm2) were uniformly seeded onto Fn-coated glass coverslips (25 mm diameter) mounted on the device and allowed to attach for 15 min in the presence or absence of mAbs. The chamber of the device was filled with buffer, and disks were spun for 10 min at constant speed with controlled acceleration rates. Adherent cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, and stained with ethidium homodimer. Disks were analyzed by counting the number of nuclei per microscope field (0.5 mm2) using a motorized stage and image analysis software (Phase 3 Imaging, Version 3.0, Glen Mills, PA). Sixty-one fields were analyzed per disk and normalized to the nuclei count at the disk center for which the applied force is zero. Using a non-linear computer algorithm, the fraction of adherent cells (f) was fitted to a sigmoidal curve (f = 1.0/(1.0 + exp [b (τ − τ50)]) where τ is the surface shear stress, b is the inflection slope, and τ50 is the inflection point. For integrin cross-linking experiments, cells were seeded onto Fn-coated coverslips for 10 min, incubated in 1 mmsulfo-BSOCOES for 5 min, and then spun and analyzed as before. Measurements of receptor binding to soluble Fn were performed (15Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, K562 cells were washed and resuspended in DPBS + 2 mm glucose + 1 mg/ml BSA. Binding experiments were conducted in 200-μl volumes, consisting of 100 μl of cell suspension (1.3 × 106 cells), 50 μl of 125I-Fn, and 50 μl of TS2/16 mAb, buffer, or inhibitor (EDTA + NaN3). After incubating for 30 min at 22 °C under gentle agitation, 50-μl aliquots were layered in triplicate onto 300 μl of 20% sucrose. Bound Fn was separated from unbound by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min and quantified. For nonspecific binding, cells were incubated in 5 mm EDTA + 0.01% NaN3. Binding data was analyzed for absolute number of receptors per cell and equilibrium binding constant using a non-linear computer algorithm for monovalent receptor-ligand binding. K562 cells were transfected with pRSVneo α5 (34Reszka A.A. Hayashi Y. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) by electroporation at 300 V/500 microfarad (GenePulser II, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Colonies were selected for G418 antibiotic resistance and analyzed by flow cytometry using the anti-α5 rat mAb BIIG2 or anti-β1 rat mAb AIIB2. Briefly, cells were resuspended in DPBS + 0.1% BSA + 0.01% NaN3. Cells were incubated in primary mAb, washed, incubated in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG, and analyzed in a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Receptor values for the transfected cells were converted to absolute numbers by combining cytometry data with soluble Fn binding measurements for untransfected cells. The objective of this analysis was to develop an experimental framework to reduce the number of variables associated with adhesion measurements and provide measurements of the force required to disrupt specific receptor-ligand interactions. We used a spinning disk device to apply a range of hydrodynamic forces to adherent cells (30Garcı́a A.J. Ducheyne P. Boettiger D. Biomaterials. 1997; 18: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For this configuration, the applied force varies linearly along the surface of the disk allowing the application of a wide range of forces in a single experiment under uniform chemical conditions. The flow patterns in this device were validated using an electrochemical method over the full range of speeds used in the adhesion experiments. As shown in Equation 1, the applied shear stress τ (force/area) at any point on the surface of the disk varies linearly with radial position and is given, τ=0.800rρμω3Equation 1 where r is radial position from the disk center, ρ and μ are fluid density and viscosity, respectively, and ω is angular speed. Cells were seeded on a coverslip mounted on the device and spun at a constant speed. Fluid flow over the cells on the disk produces a detachment force that is proportional to the hydrodynamic shear force in Equation 1. Cells at the center experience negligible force, and cell numbers decrease toward the outside of the disk as the applied force increases. Thus, for a single disk, a linear range of forces is applied to a large cell population producing a cell detachment profile that allows the calculation of a mean detachment force. We define this mean detachment force as the adhesion strength. The applied hydrodynamic force is dependent on cell shape; for spherical cells, exact solutions have been derived (35Goldman A.J. Cox R.G. Brenner H. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1967; 22: 653-660Crossref Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 36Hammer D.A. Lauffenburger D.A. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 475-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). K562 cells were chosen because they remain spherical even when plated on Fn-coated surfaces. From a biochemical perspective, this cell line is an ideal model because it allows the examination of a single receptor-ligand interaction. These cells express a single Fn receptor, integrin α5β1, and no other α chains that associate with β1 (37Hemler M.E. Huang C. Schwarz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3300-3309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α5β1 receptor on K562 cells is expressed in a low binding state based on its reduced ability to bind Fn in solution and weak cell adhesion to Fn. To increase Fn binding, α5β1 integrin was activated by addition of mAb TS2/16 (38van de Wiel-van Kemenade E. van Kooyk Y. de Boer A.J. Huijbens R.J.F. Weber P. van de Kasteele W. Melief C.J.M. Figdor C.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). TS2/16 was added at saturating levels to provide for uniform activation of all α5β1. Cell densities for individual fields exhibited a Poisson distribution prior to spinning, and it is expected that the ability of individual cells to withstand a specific detachment force will be a normally distributed property over the population. The combination of these distributions predicts a sigmoidal adhesion curve with a mean adhesion strength given by the shear stress for 50% detachment (τ50). As expected, the fraction of adherent cells (f) decreased non-linearly with shear stress (τ), and the data was fitted to a sigmoidal curve (Fig. 2). The sigmoidal model accurately described the experimental data (mean R 2 = 0.90 ± 0.10). Since all scored fields were used to calculate τ50, this value represents the measurement of the effect of the force field on >12,000 cells. The values determined by this assay have been reproducible within 10% over a 10-month period. Experiments at different rotational speeds for the same Fn concentration demonstrated that the observed sigmoidal decrease in cell numbers was a function of applied force. By varying the rotational speed, the detachment profile shifted along the disk surface; however, the shear stress for 50% detachment remained the same for all speeds (data not shown). Experiments using different cell seeding densities revealed that, for the cell densities examined (200–800 cells/mm2), the detachment profile and attachment strength were independent of cell density (data not shown). Experiments were conducted for different seeding times to determine whether TS2/16-activated K562 cells exhibit adhesion strengthening upon receptor binding. There were no differences in adhesion strength between 5 and 15 min or at 15 min in the presence of NaN3to inhibit energy-dependent processes (data not shown), demonstrating no evident strengthening response at these initial times and validating this cell model for analyzing the initial integrin receptor-Fn interaction. The mechanism of detachment was examined using the membrane-impermeable, homobifunctional NHS-ester sulfo-BSOCOES to cross-link integrins bound to Fn. Cross-linking bound integrins in TS2/16-activated cells resulted in >2-fold increase in adhesion strength compared with uncross-linked controls, shown as a right shift in the detachment profile (Fig. 3). Cross-linking cells without activated receptors yielded background levels of adhesion (data not shown), indicating that the adhesive force is specifically provided by the bound receptors. The significant increase in adhesion strength as a result of cross-linking bound receptors demonstrates that detachment occurs at the integrin-Fn junction, and the assay, therefore, measures the strength of this interaction. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D (CD, 1 μm) altered the failure mechanism by compromising cellular integrity. CD treatment of cells cross-linked to the substrate reduced adhesion to the same levels as uncross-linked cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that failure occurs somewhere other than at the integrin-Fn junction. Moreover, CD-treated cells ruptured and left behind considerable cellular debris after detachment; this was not observed in untreated cells. These findings suggest that treatment with CD is not appropriate for examining the role of actin cytoskeleton in cell adhesion because it is not specific to the actin-adhesion complex interaction and introduces a mechanical artifact. To examine the relationship between adhesion strength and ligand density, disks coated with different levels of Fn were analyzed. Fig. 4 shows a family of detachment profiles for different Fn densities. As expected, increasing the Fn coating concentration generates a family of sigmoids that shift to the right with increasing concentration, indicating a direct relationship between ligand density and adhesion strength. To further analyze the specificity of the interaction, the mAbs HFN7.1 that interacts with the cell binding domain of Fn (39Schoen R.C. Bentley K.L. Klebe R.J. Hybridoma. 1982; 1: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and BIIG2 which reacts with the α5 chain and inhibits its binding to Fn (40Hall D.E. Reichardt L.F. Crowley E. Holley B. Moezzi H. Sonnenberg A. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2175-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) were examined. In the presence of TS2/16, each of these mAbs reduced K562 adhesion to levels similar to those in the absence of TS2/16 or surface Fn (Fig. 5). The low level of adhesion in the presence of these inhibitory mAbs or in the absence of TS2/16 represents nonspecific adhesion due primarily to electrostatic interactions.Figure 5Blocking experiments demonstrating specificity of α5β1 integrin-Fn interaction: 5 μg/ml Fn + TS2/16 (•); 0 Fn + TS2/16 (▪); 5 μg/ml Fn (□); 5 μg/ml Fn + HFN7.1 + TS2/16 (▴); 5 μg/ml Fn + TS2/16 + BIIG2 (▾).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our analysis is based on the theoretical work of Bell (41Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar) as later refined by Hammer and Lauffenburger (36Hammer D.A. Lauffenburger D.A. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 475-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The adhesion model considers a spherical cell with a single class of receptors attaching to a surface through uniformly distributed receptor-ligand complexes. The force per unit area or shear stress for detachment, τd, is given by the following. τd=GψNRNL+λEquation 2 This equation consists of five elements: (i) a geometric parameter (G) related to the total force exerted by the bonds in the contact area to resist the hydrodynamic force applied to the cell. (ii) The adhesion constant ψ is a novel experimental parameter specific to the receptor-ligand interaction. ψ is related to the bond strength and receptor-ligand affinity and has units of force-length2. This parameter is analogous to the equilibrium binding constant used for describing receptor-ligand interactions in solution. (iii) N R represents the receptor density. (iv) N L is adsorbed ligand density. (v) λ represents the nonspecific adhesion between the cell and the surface, arising largely from electrostatic interactions. This model predicts that adhesion strength is determined directly by the number of receptor-ligand complexes in the contact area and that the constant ψ is a measure of bond strength. For this model, ψ is independent of geometry and ligand and receptor densities but is dependent on integrin activation state. If valid, this experimental approach could be used to provide a direct measurement of the activation state of integrin receptors. The ability to perform this analysis on whole cells ensures proper presentation of the receptors on the surface and provides a system that is amenable to genetic manipulation and potentially applicable to a wide range of adhesion receptors. The relationships predicted by the model shown in Equation 2 were examined individually. 125I-Fn was adsorbed to glass surfaces at different coating concentrations, and adsorbed ligand was quantified (Fig. 6). Fn surface density is relatively linear up to about 10 μg/ml coating concentration, after which it saturates. These values are in general agreement with previous measurements (42Grinnell F. Feld M.K. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 1981; 15: 363-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 43DiMilla P.A. Albelda S.M. Quinn J.A. J.

Res. 1993; 27: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The saturation density represents the approximate amount of Fn required for a monolayer coating based on estimates of the dimensions of the Fn molecule (45Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, NY1990: 113-175Crossref Google Scholar). Combining measurements for adsorbed Fn density with adhesion profiles for different ligand densities, mean adhesion strength (τ50) was plotted as a function of Fn surface density (N L) (Fig. 7). Mean adhesion strength increased linearly with Fn surface density in the presence of activating mAb TS2/16. In the absence of TS2/16, adhesion strength was independent of Fn surface density and was indistinguishable from nonspecific binding measured in EDTA + NaN3. This linear relationship is consistent with the model and the difference in the two conditions results from differences in bond strength and affinity for the integrin-Fn bond arising from binding of activating mAb. Differences in slope demonstrate differences in the activation state of integrin α5β1that are reflected by differences in ψ since all other parameters are held constant. The absolute number of receptors per cell was determined from binding curves of125I-Fn to K562 cells in suspension in presence of TS2/16 (Fig. 8). This analysis revealed 1.0 ± 0.08 × 105 receptors per cell andK D equal to 98 ± 16 nm(R 2 = 0.94). In the absence of activating mAb, binding of soluble Fn was indistinguishable from cells treated with EDTA + NaN3 (nonspecific binding). Thus, as for cell detachment, solution binding of Fn to the untreated α5β1 receptor expressed on K562 cells was below the detection limits of this method. The receptor number and binding constant values obtained for these cells are in good agreement with previous measurements (15Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 46Danilov Y.N. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To vary receptor density, K562 cells were transfected with the pRSVneo α5 vector and screened for increased levels of surface expressed α5β1. The adhesion strength for stable transfectants expressing α5β1integrin at 1.9, 2.3, and 5.6 times the levels on parental cells was measured for a fixed Fn surface density (110 ng/cm2). Adhesion strength increased linearly with receptor density (Fig. 9), as predicted by the model. The linear increases in adhesion strength with both ligand and receptor densities suggest that adhesion strength is a function"

A reliable means to introduce these lipids into intact cells would be of great value for showing the physiological roles of this pathway and for testing the specificity of pharmacological inhibitors of the kinases. We have stereospecifically synthesized di-C8-PIP3/AM and di-C12-PIP3/AM, the heptakis(acetoxymethyl) esters of dioctanoyl- and dilauroylphosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, in 14 steps from myo-inositol. The ability of these uncharged lipophilic derivatives to deliver phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate across cell membranes was demonstrated on 3T3-L1 adipocytes and T84 colon carcinoma monolayers. Insulin stimulation of hexose uptake into adipocytes was inhibited by the kinase inhibitor wortmannin and was largely restored by di-C8-PIP3/AM, which had no effect in the absence of insulin. Thus phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate or a metabolite was necessary but not sufficient for stimulation of hexose transport. In T84 epithelial monolayers, di-C12-PIP3/AM mimicked epidermal growth factor in inhibiting chloride secretion and potassium efflux, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate was sufficient to modulate these fluxes and mediate epidermal growth factor's action.

The recent discovery of D-3 phosphorylated inositol lipids and their biosynthesis by a family of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinases (PI3K) 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-OH kinases; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PI(3)P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; PI(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C; AM, acetoxymethyl; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; SH2, Src homology domain 2. 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-OH kinases; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PI(3)P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; PI(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C; AM, acetoxymethyl; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; SH2, Src homology domain 2. has opened a new area in cell signal transduction research (1Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). These enzymes phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate on the D-3 position of the inositol ring to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3, Fig. 1). Some forms of PI3K such as the yeast Vps34p and homologues produce exclusively PI(3)P. In mammalian cells, PI(3)P is usually constitutively present. PI(3,4)P2 and PIP3 are normally undetectable in unstimulated cells, but can become transiently elevated within seconds to minutes following stimulation with a wide range of growth factors and cytokines. This behavior is indicative of signaling roles for both PI(3,4)P2 and PIP3. Various PI3Ks can be activated through both tyrosine kinase and G-protein dependent pathways and multiple putative downstream targets have been identified including Ca2+-independent protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms δ, ε, ζ, and η, proteins with pleckstrin homology domains such as Akt/PKB, as well as other proteins such as synaptotagmin. Because PIP3 seems to play such an important role in signal transduction but is difficult to purify from biological sources, several groups have synthesized PIP3 by various synthetic routes and tested its in vitro actions on purified enzymes. However, to reveal the role of PIP3 in intact cells, especially when its precise molecular target is uncertain, it would be very helpful to be able to deliver exogenous PIP3 to its site of action inside whole cells. Such delivery would also be valuable to test the pharmacological specificity of PI3K blockers such as wortmannin. The ability of wortmannin to inhibit a cellular response is often taken to suggest that the response involves PI3K. The best test to prove the specificity of wortmannin for PI3K would be to deliver PIP3 by other means and show that the cellular response is restored. Unfortunately, PIP3 has at least 4 negative charges at physiological pH, so it is extremely unlikely to diffuse into cells by itself. Therefore effective administration of PIP3 itself to intact cells is problematic. A possible strategy to deliver PIP3 across the plasma membrane would be to derivatize the phosphates as acetoxymethyl (AM) esters so that the resulting neutral molecule can cross the plasma membrane by passive diffusion. The desirable feature of AM esters is that they are readily hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases, which should regenerate PIP3 inside the cells. This approach has previously been successfully applied to antitumor nucleotides (2Sastry J.K. Nehete P.N. Khan S. Nowak B.J. Plunkett W. Arlinghaus R.B. Farquhar D. Mol.

We now report the stereospecific total synthesis of the heptakis (acetoxymethyl) esters of dioctanoyl- and dilauroyl-PIP3 and tests of their biological effects on insulin-stimulated glucose transport into intact fat cells and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated chloride transport across monolayers of T84 colon carcinoma cells. The ability of insulin to stimulate uptake of glucose in muscle and fat tissue plays a central role in the maintenance of whole body glucose homeostasis (9Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1644-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathway utilized by insulin in promoting glucose transport has been shown to involve autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor with ensuing activation of its intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates such as IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3 (10Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 6: 117-142Google Scholar, 11Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). PI3K interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins through an SH2 domain on its regulatory p85 subunit (12Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), thus activating its catalytic p110 subunit (13Shoelson S.E. Sivaraja M. Williams K.P. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Weiss M.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The conclusion that PI3K is essential for insulin regulation of glucose transport is based largely on the use of the inhibitors wortmannin (14Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and LY294002 (15Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). These studies have been supported by other approaches, such as overexpression of dominant negative or constitutively active PI3K mutants (16Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. O'Rahilly S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 17: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The impact of PI3K stimulation on glucose transport is mediated either directly by the D-3 phosphorylated inositol phospholipid products of the enzyme, or alternatively by activation of intermediate molecules. Recently, two such downstream effectors of PI3K have been proposed, the serine/threonine kinase Akt or protein kinase B (17Downward J. Nature. 1995; 376: 553-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and specific isoforms of protein kinase C (18Farese R.V. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Because of the known pharmacology of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and the importance of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in these cells, they are a suitable system to test the effects of the membrane-permeant PIP3 esters, especially their ability to bypass wortmannin blockade. Regulation of chloride ion flux plays a key role in the control of salt and fluid secretion across mucous membranes in addition to a variety of other functions. An important model system for epithelial transport is the T84 colon carcinoma cell line, which forms monolayers that actively transport Cl− in response to a variety of agonists in much the same way as normal intestinal epithelia. Cl− secretion in T84 cells can be triggered through cyclic AMP (20Weymer A. Huott P. Liu W. McRoberts J.A. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1828-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and calcium-dependent signaling mechanisms (21Dharmsathaphorn K. Cohn J. Beuerlein G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C1224-C1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in many other systems, these pathways interact synergistically in T84 (22Cartwright C.A. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G.

More recently, we have identified two receptor-activated pathways which limit Cl− secretion through the calcium-dependent but not through the cyclic AMP-dependent pathway: 1) prolonged stimulation of the muscarinic M3 receptor on T84 cells leads to accumulation of intracellular Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, which, in turn, inhibits transepithelial Cl− efflux by restricting flow through apically located Cl− channels (6Vajanaphanich M.

Nature. 1994; 371: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). 2) Another pathway, stimulated by EGF and inhibited by wortmannin, also restricts transepithelial Cl− transport (25Uribe J.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) by limiting basolateral efflux through K+ channels (26Barrett K.E. Smitham J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Uribe J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 43: C958-C965Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, the effects of EGF and carbachol are additive (25Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), further arguing that the two inhibitory pathways are independent. EGF probably works at least partly through stimulation of PI3K, because EGF treatment elevates PIP3, and the effect of EGF can be ablated by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (25Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Eckmann L. Rudolf M.T. Ptasznik A. Schultz C. Jiang T.

However, these results obtained with standard techniques leave open the questions of whether the wortmannin block is specific and whether EGF might also have other biochemical effects that are also necessary for its inhibition of carbachol-stimulated Cl− flux. Such effects would be plausible because the EGF receptor is a powerful tyrosine kinase with many targets other than PI3K. Therefore we tested whether either PIP3/AM or PIP3 could mimic the effect of EGF. All chemicals from commercial sources were used without further purification. d-myo-Inositol (Aldrich) was dried at 80 °C under high vacuum overnight before use.sn-1,2-Dioctanoylglycerol andsn-1,2-dilauroylglycerol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.

(Burlington, ON, Canada). 3T3-L1 cells were a kind gift from Dr. G. Holman (University of Bath, United Kingdom) and were grown in monolayer culture in 12-well plates, bathed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum and 1% (v/v) antibiotic solution (10,000 units/ml penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C and this medium was replenished every 48 h. Prior to experimental manipulation, the cells were depleted of serum for 3 h. 3T3-L1 adipocyte monolayers were rinsed with 140 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4. Glucose uptake was measured in 0.25-ml incubation volumes using 10 μm2-[3H]deoxyglucose (1 μCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products) for 5 min. Previous studies have demonstrated 2-deoxyglucose uptake to be linear in this time period. The radioactive solution was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold isotonic saline solution. Cells were disrupted with 1.0 ml of 0.05 nNaOH, and the radioactivity of a 0.75-ml aliquot of the cell lysate was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting using an LKB 1217 β-counter. Protein concentration of the lysate was determined using the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 247-254Crossref Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B (Sigma) and was subtracted from total uptake. T84 cells (passages 15–45) were grown and maintained as described previously (30Dharmsathaphorn K. Mandel K.G. McRoberts J.A. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 264: G204-G208Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media (JRH Biosciences, Lexena, KS) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml each of penicillin/streptomycin (Core Cell Culture Facility, University of California, San Diego). Cells used in experiments were plated on Costar “snap-well” inserts and maintained in culture for 6–10 days to allow for formation of tight junctions prior to the experiment. Snapwell inserts containing confluent T84 monolayers were incubated for 0.5 h at 37 °C with 0.1 ml of PIP3 derivatives (200 μm) or vehicle applied to the apical side. The monolayers were then mounted into modified Ussing chambers (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA), whose basolateral side was bathed with Ringers solution warmed to 37 °C and gassed continuously with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at a rate of 30–35 ml/min. The spontaneous potential difference across the monolayer was short-circuited with a voltage clamp (Model VCC MC6, Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). Short circuit current (I sc) and conductances were recorded at 4-s intervals using Acquire and Analyze Software 1.1. (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). Increased I sc in T84 has been demonstrated to reflect transepithelial Cl− secretion (21Dharmsathaphorn K. Cohn J. Beuerlein G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C1224-C1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rb+ flux measurements were a modification of a method previously published by Venglarik et al. (31Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C358-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers grown on Costar snap-well inserts (Cambridge, MA) were rinsed in Hank's balanced salt solution containing (in mm) Na+, 137.6; Cl−, 146.3; K+ 5.8; H2PO4−, 0.44; HPO42−, 0.34; Ca2+, 1; Mg2+, 1; HEPES (pH 7.2), 15; and d-glucose, 10. The cells were loaded for 30 min with 5 μCi/0.25 ml at 37 °C added to the basolateral surface. Simultaneously, the apical surface was bathed with cell permeant esters of PIP3 (200 μm) or vehicle. Following 4 rinses of apical and basolateral surfaces with Hank's buffer over a period of 6 min, the inserts were sequentially transferred at 2-min intervals to fresh wells of a 24-well culture dish floating in a 37 °C water bath. After 12 min, the inserts were transferred to wells containing 0.1 mm carbachol for the remainder of the experiment. After the experiment, the contents of the wells and the inserts were transferred to vials containing Ecoscint which were counted in a Packard scintillation counter. The data was analyzed as described by Venglariket al. (31Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C358-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) yielding rate constants of nuclide efflux at 2-min intervals. The synthesis of acetoxymethyl esters of PIP3 (Fig. 2) started with enantiomerically pured-1-O-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)-3,4,5-O-tribenzoyl-myo-inositol (4) which was prepared from myo-inositol in 4 steps with 30% yield. The synthesis of 4 was developed by Bruzik and Tsai (28Bruzik K.S. Tsai M.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6361-6374Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and their method offers many advantages including enantiomeric purity and good yield. The NMR spectra, MS, and optical rotation of the diol 4 that we prepared are all consistent with their report. Diol 4 was then protected with benzyloxymethyl ethers, which can be easily removed by hydrogenolysis at the end of the synthesis without affecting the other groups on the product. At this stage, the myo-inositol 1-hydroxyl was still protected as a tert-butyldiphenylsilyl ether, whose bulk was essential for regioselectivity in the synthesis of4. But we found that tert-butyldiphenylsilyl could not be removed at a late stage without cleavage of other protecting groups, so it had to be replaced in 7 by dimethylisopropylsilyl. The benzoate groups on 7 were removed by KCN in methanol to give triol 8, which was phosphitylated on the 3, 4, and 5 positions and oxidized to9 with phosphates protected as β-cyanoethyl esters. At this stage, the dimethylisopropylsilyl chloride protecting the 1-hydroxyl could be cleaved by 2.5% HF to give 10 without affecting the other protecting groups. The 1-hydroxyl of 10wa"

https://openalex.org/W1986151431,"Interferon-γ (IFNγ), in common with a number of growth factors, binds both to heparan sulfate or heparin-related molecules and to a specific high affinity receptor (IFNγR). Using surface plasmon resonance technology, kinetic analysis of the IFNγ·IFNγR complex formation was performed with the extracellular part of IFNγR immobilized on a sensor chip. At the sensor chip surface, IFNγ was bound by two IFNγR molecules with an affinity in the nanomolar range (0.68 nm). This binding was characterized by an important on rate, k on = 7.3 × 106m−1·s−1, and an off rate,k off = 5 × 10−3·s−1. This binding assay was used to investigate a possible role of heparin in the IFNγ·IFNγR complex formation. In contrast to growth factors for which binding to heparin is usually required for high affinity receptor interaction, we found in this study that IFNγ bound to heparin displayed a strongly reduced affinity for its receptor. This is consistent with the fact that a cluster of basic amino acids (KTGKRKR, called the C1 domain) in the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the cytokine was involved both in heparin and receptor recognition. To understand how a single domain of IFNγ could be implicated in two discrete functions (i.e. binding to heparin and to IFNγR), we also analyzed in a detailed manner the role of the IFNγ carboxyl-terminal sequence in receptor binding. Using forms of IFNγ, with carboxyl terminus truncations of defined regions of the heparin binding sequence, we found that the C1 domain functioned by increasing the on rate of the IFNγ·IFNγR binding reaction but was not otherwise required for the stability of the complex. Interactions between the IFNγ carboxyl-terminal domain and IFNγR could increased the association rate of the reaction either by increasing the number of encounters between the two molecules or by favoring productive collisions. The mechanisms by which heparan sulfate regulates IFNγ activity may thus include both control of selective protease cleavage events, which directly affect the cytokine activity, and also an ability to modulate the interaction of IFNγ with the IFNγR via competitive binding to the C1 domain. Interferon-γ (IFNγ), in common with a number of growth factors, binds both to heparan sulfate or heparin-related molecules and to a specific high affinity receptor (IFNγR). Using surface plasmon resonance technology, kinetic analysis of the IFNγ·IFNγR complex formation was performed with the extracellular part of IFNγR immobilized on a sensor chip. At the sensor chip surface, IFNγ was bound by two IFNγR molecules with an affinity in the nanomolar range (0.68 nm). This binding was characterized by an important on rate, k on = 7.3 × 106m−1·s−1, and an off rate,k off = 5 × 10−3·s−1. This binding assay was used to investigate a possible role of heparin in the IFNγ·IFNγR complex formation. In contrast to growth factors for which binding to heparin is usually required for high affinity receptor interaction, we found in this study that IFNγ bound to heparin displayed a strongly reduced affinity for its receptor. This is consistent with the fact that a cluster of basic amino acids (KTGKRKR, called the C1 domain) in the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the cytokine was involved both in heparin and receptor recognition. To understand how a single domain of IFNγ could be implicated in two discrete functions (i.e. binding to heparin and to IFNγR), we also analyzed in a detailed manner the role of the IFNγ carboxyl-terminal sequence in receptor binding.

Interactions between the IFNγ carboxyl-terminal domain and IFNγR could increased the association rate of the reaction either by increasing the number of encounters between the two molecules or by favoring productive collisions. The mechanisms by which heparan sulfate regulates IFNγ activity may thus include both control of selective protease cleavage events, which directly affect the cytokine activity, and also an ability to modulate the interaction of IFNγ with the IFNγR via competitive binding to the C1 domain. Interferon-γ (IFNγ) 1The abbreviations used are: IFNγ, interferon-γ; IFNγR, interferon-γ receptor; IFNγRα, IFNγ receptor α-chain; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RU, resonance units; sIFNγR, soluble IFNγ receptor. is a highly pleiotropic protein secreted by activated T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells (1Billiau A. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 61-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active form of this cytokine is a homodimer consisting of two intertwined 143-amino acid polypeptides. Each monomer consists of six helices (denoted A–F), linked by loops, and an unfolded sequence at the carboxyl-terminal side (downstream to the F helix, amino acids 124–143), which extends away from the molecule (2Farrar M.A. Shreiber R.D.

IFNγ mediates its pleiotropic activities through a specific transmembrane receptor (IFNγR) expressed at the surface of almost all cells (5Van Loon A.P.G.M. Ozmen L. Fountoulakis M. Kania M. Haiker M. Garotta G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 49: 462-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This receptor is composed of a ligand-binding subunit, or α-chain (IFNγRα) and an accessory factor, or β-chain which is required for signal transduction (6Soh J. Donnelly R.J. Kotenko S. Mariano T.M.

Cell. 1994; 76: 803-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The IFNγ·IFNγRα complex consists of two receptors bound to an IFNγ dimer, a stoichiometry consistent with the symmetry of the ligand (8Fountoulakis M. Zulauf M. Lustig A. Garotta G. Eur. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18103-18110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IFNγ residues involved in receptor binding are situated in two areas of the molecule (10Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11Walter M.R. Windsor W.T. Nagabhushan T.L. Lundell D.J. Lunn C.A. Zauodny P.J. Narula S.K.

The carboxyl-terminal sequence (residues 124–143) is highly flexible and/or adopts multiple conformations (3Ealick S.E. Cook W.J. Vijay-Kumar S. Carson M. Nagabhushan T.L. Trorra P.P. Bugg C.E.

Bax A Biochemistry. 1992; 32: 8180-8190Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It contains two small clusters of basic amino acids (C1, residues 125–131, KTGKRKR; C2, residues 137–140, RGRR), which confer on the molecule a important sensitivity to a variety of proteases (12Trinchieri G. Perussia B. Immunol. Today. 1985; 6: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 13Döbeli H. Gentz R. Jucker W. Garotta G. Hartmann D.W. Hochuli E. J.

As a consequence, native IFNγ is usually a mixture of carboxyl-truncated molecules lacking up to 16 amino acids and therefore may end anywhere from Gln143 (full-length molecule) to Gly127. Since deletion of less than 10 amino acid increases the bioactivity of IFNγ, while more extended cleavages of the carboxyl-terminal domain have the opposite effect, it has been speculated that the cytokine activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis. The portion of the carboxyl terminus that appeared to be the most important in this process is the basic sequence KRKR of the C1 domain, since the beginning of its removal correlated with loss of activity, while cleavages downstream of this sequence resulted in the observed increased activity (13Döbeli H. Gentz R. Jucker W. Garotta G. Hartmann D.W. Hochuli E. J. Biotechnol. 1988; 7: 199-216Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, as revealed by the crystal structure of the IFNγ·IFNγRα complex, specific interactions between this basic sequence of IFNγ and IFNγR have not been identified, and the carboxyl-terminal tail of the cytokine did not appear to be involved in receptor binding (11Walter M.R. Windsor W.T. Nagabhushan T.L. Lundell D.J. Lunn C.A. Zauodny P.J. Narula S.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Furthermore, while both antibodies directed against amino or carboxyl terminus block biological activity, only synthetic peptides comprising the amino-terminal domain of the cytokine block binding to its receptor in a competitive manner (15Jarpe M.A. Johnson H.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3304-3309PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that if a positive charge localized in the carboxyl-terminal part of the cytokine is important for activity, it can be contributed by a number of different combinations of positions. Therefore, this part of the molecule did not appear to function in a specific manner, and its function remains unclear (16Wetzel R. Perry L.J. Veilleux C. Chang G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of IFNγ also confers on the molecule a high affinity (K d = 1.5 nm) for heparan sulfate (17Lortat-Jacob H. Kleinman H.K. Grimaud J.-A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or heparin-related molecules (18Lortat-Jacob H. Grimaud J.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A fragment of heparan sulfate that displays high affinity for IFNγ has been isolated. It consists of two small sulfated heparin-like sequences linked together by an extended internal N-acetyl-rich domain (19Lortat-Jacob H. Turnbull J.E. Grimaud J.-A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the IFNγ·heparan sulfate complex, the two carboxyl termini of an IFNγ dimer interacted with the two heparin-like sequences of the heparan sulfate fragment, mainly through the basic C1 and C2 domains (20Lortat-Jacob H. Grimaud J.-A. Febs Lett. 1991; 280: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether or not IFNγ bound to heparin could also interact with its high affinity cell surface receptor. Using the Biacore system, we analyzed kinetic aspects of the IFNγ·IFNγR complex formation and, in particular, the importance of the heparin binding sequence of IFNγ for this interaction. We found that IFNγ binding to heparin and to IFNγR are mutually exclusive and that the C1 sequence increased the association rate of the IFNγ·IFNγR binding reaction. An upgraded Biacore system, certified CM5 sensor chips, and HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.05% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) were from Biacore AB. Biotin-LC-hydrazide was from Pierce, and streptavidin was from Sigma. Proteolytic enzymes (activated factor X, carboxypeptidase Y, endoproteinase Arg-C) and enzyme inhibitor (pefablock) were from Boehringer. Recombinant IFNγ (IFNγ143, batch number L 405), IFNγ lacking the last 19 amino acids on the carboxyl-terminal side (IFNγ124), and the two monoclonal antibodies (293-4-45 and 13-16-2) used in this study were kind gifts of Roussel Uclaf company. The extracellular part of the human IFNγ receptor (sIFNγR) α-chain, produced in Sf9 cells, was a kind gift of Dr. L. Ozmen (Hoffmann La Roche), and fractionated heparin was from Sanofi Recherche. Full-length IFNγ (IFNγ143) was digested with either activated factor X (1 unit/ml in 50 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8, buffer for 1 h at 25 °C), carboxypeptidase Y (20Lortat-Jacob H. Grimaud J.-A. Febs Lett. 1991; 280: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), or endoproteinase Arg-C (2.5 units/ml in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8, buffer for 4 h at 25 °C). Enzymatic reactions were stopped with 1 mmpefablock and analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. For that purpose, digested samples were made 0.4 mg/ml in 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer and analyzed using a Perkin-Elmer Sciex API III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a nebulizer-assisted electrospray (ionspray) source. Samples were directly infused into the source using a syringe pump at a flow rate of 5 μl/min and an injector equipped with a 1-μl internal loop or were desalted using a reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography column coupled to the electrospray source. The ionspray probe tip was held at 5000 V, and spectra were recorded in the 900–1800 range of mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios in steps of 0.4m/z, with a 1.7-ms dwell time. The signal was averaged over four scans. Specific antiviral activity of the IFNγ samples were determined with a microtiter inhibition of cytopathic effect assay using Wish cells against vesicular stomatitis virus (21Berg K. Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1990; 98: 156-162Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The purified sIFNγR (22Gentz R. Hayes A. Grau N. Fountoulakis M. Lahm H.W. Ozmen L. Garotta G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was prepared at 0.27 mg/ml (8 μm) in 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6, and reacted for 20 min in the dark and at 4 °C with 10 mm sodium periodate to oxidize the glycan parts of the molecule. The reaction was quenched with 15 mmglycerol, and the sample was dialyzed against the 20 mmphosphate buffer. Biotin-hydrazide (including a 2.5-nm spacer arm between the biotin and hydrazide groups) was then added to a concentration of 5 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. The sample was made to 100 mmethanolamine, and then extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Biotinylation was checked by Western blot analysis, and samples were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The flow rate of the running buffer (HBS) was maintained at 5 μl/min, and the temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Two flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip were activated with 50 μl of a mixture of 0.2 m1-ethyl-3-(3 dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimine 0.05 m N-hydroxy-sulfosuccinimide, after which 50 μl of streptavidin (0.2 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.2) was injected. Unreacted groups were blocked with a 50-μl injection of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Approximately 8000 resonance units (RU) of streptavidin were fixed on the surface by this procedure. Biotinylated sIFNγR (10 μl/ml in HBS) was then injected for 1 min on one of the two streptavidin surfaces (the other one being a negative control). Both flow cells were then conditioned with 10 2-min pulses of 10 mm HCl. This resulted in the attachment of 800 RU of IFNγR. The conversion of RU to surface concentration of proteins was performed using a conversion factor of 1000 RU = 1 ng/mm2. Test samples were diluted in HBS maintained at 25 °C and injected over the IFNγR surface at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. This high flow rate was necessary to reduce mass transport effect due to the high association rate of the proteins being studied. Using the Kinject command, usually 200 μl of IFNγ or IFNγ-derived molecules were injected across the IFNγR surface, after which the formed complexes were washed at 50 μl/min with HBS to study the dissociation phase. The IFNγR surface was regenerated with a 2-min pulse of 10 mm HCl. For kinetic analysis, a complete set of sensorgrams were recorded with eight different IFNγ concentrations in the range 0–0.5 μg/ml. Sets of sensorgrams were analyzed with the Biaevaluation 2.1 software, provided with the machine, using both linear transformation of the primary data and nonlinear fitting of the sensorgrams. Briefly, the equation for the measured binding rate (dR/dt) as a function of the binding response (R) is dR/dt =k on CR max − (k on C +k off)Rt n, wherek on and k off are the association and dissociation rate constant, C is the concentration of the analyte (IFNγ), R max is the binding capacity of the immobilized ligand (IFNγR), andRt n is the amount of analyte bound to ligand at timet n . Kinetic constants (k onand k off) can be obtained by linear transformation of a set of sensorgrams using a plot of ln(dR/dt) versus time for each analyte concentration. These plots give a line of which the slope isk s . A secondary plot of these slopes (k s ) versus C is then used to determinek on and k off from the linear relationship k s =k on C + k off. Association and dissociation rate constants can also be extracted from a single sensorgram (i.e. a single analyte injection). In that case, the integrated forms of the rate equations (r = R oexp(−k off(t −t d )) for dissociation and r =R eq (1 − exp(−(k on C +k off)(t −t d ))) for association, whereR eq is the steady-state binding response andt a and t d are the start times for association and dissociation) were fitted to the experimental data by nonlinear regression (23Karlsson R. Fält A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In some cases to derive kinetic constants, numerical integration, which allows fitting of data to complex interaction models, was performed (Biaevaluation 3.0 software). Data were analyzed by global fitting of both association and dissociation phases for several concentrations simultaneously. Affinity (dissociation equilibrium constants, K d ) were calculated from the ratio of dissociation and association rate constants (K d =k off/k on). Using the Biacore technology, we set up a binding assay to analyze the IFNγ/IFNγR interaction, in particular the kinetic aspects. The Biacore instrument uses surface plasmon resonance to measure changes in refractive index when a soluble analyte (here IFNγ) binds to an immobilized ligand (IFNγR). Biotinylated sIFNγR was immobilized on a streptavidin-activated sensor chip, at a density of 0.8 ng/mm2 (800 RU). Biotin groups had been attached to the glycan part of the receptor (a part not required for ligand binding (24Fountoulakis M. Gentz R. Biotechnology. 1992; 10: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)) to ensure that 100% of the molecules remain active upon immobilization. When IFNγ was injected over the IFNγR surface, a typical sensorgram was obtained (Fig. 1 a), with an association phase (A), equilibrium (E), and, when IFNγ was replaced by running buffer alone, a dissociation phase (D). Preincubation of the cytokine with increasing concentrations of its soluble receptor completely inhibited the interaction with the immobilized IFNγR, demonstrating the specificity of the binding (Fig. 1 a). In addition, upon injection of IFNγ over a control surface (containing streptavidin only) no binding was observed (Fig. 1 b). Maximum binding was approximately 400 RU. Since we had 800 RU of immobilized IFNγR, this suggests that each IFNγ dimer (34 kDa) has been bound by two IFNγR molecules (32 kDa each). Dimerization of IFNγR by its ligand also occurs both in solution and at the cell surface (9Greenlund A.C. Screiber R.D. Goeddel D.V. Pennica D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18103-18110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirmed this stoichiometry at the sensor chip surface, we also injected sIFNγR on a preformed IFNγ·IFNγR complex. As shown on Fig. 1 c, the complex was unable to bind additional IFNγR, demonstrating that it already contained two IFNγR molecules per IFNγ dimer. Nonlinear least squares regression analysis of the sensorgram (Fig. 1 a, upper curve), using a simple A + B = AB model, gave ak off = 1.2 × 10−3·s−1 and a k on = 4.5 × 106m−1·s−1 and therefore an equilibrium dissociation constant K d = 0.26 nm. This is higher than the affinity of IFNγ for its soluble receptor (1.5 nm) reported with other methods (9Greenlund A.C. Screiber R.D. Goeddel D.V. Pennica D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18103-18110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that we observed deviation of the data from the simple model we used. This may be caused by factors that derive from the biosensor method itself (25Karlsson R. Roos H. Fägerstam L. Persson B. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 99-110Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar), such as rate-limiting mass transport effect or rebinding of the ligand during the dissociation phase (see below). One of our objectives was to determine whether IFNγ bound to heparin was still able to interact with its receptor. For that purpose, IFNγ was preincubated with increasing concentrations of different heparin molecules and then injected over the IFNγR surface (Fig. 2). The first set of sensorgrams show that a 12-kDa heparin fragment bound to IFNγ strongly decreased the on rate of the reaction (Fig. 2 a). As a consequence, the amount of IFNγ bound to its receptor was strongly reduced. This heparin fragment (12 kDa, approximately 20 disaccharides in length) represented the minimum length that binds efficiently to IFNγ and functions by bridging two IFNγ monomers (19Lortat-Jacob H. Turnbull J.E. Grimaud J.-A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Smaller heparin fragments (4.5 kDa, approximately 8 disaccharides in length) displayed a strongly reduced ability to inhibit the IFNγ·IFNγR complex formation (Fig. 2 b), while a hexasaccharide (1.8 kDa) was completely inactive, even at a 50-fold molar excess (Fig. 2 c). To investigate which of the two basic clusters, C1 and C2, involved in heparin binding could be implicated in receptor interaction, IFNγ preincubated with two different monoclonal antibodies (mAb), was injected over the IFNγR surface. These two mAbs (293-4-45 and 13-16-2) defined two overlapping sequences of the carboxyl-terminal part of IFNγ (amino acids 125–134, which encompass the first basic domain C1 of the carboxyl-terminal part of the cytokine for mAb 293-4-45, and amino acids 132–138, which overlap the second basic domain C2 for mAb 13-16-2) and are described elsewhere (26Cousin M.A. Damais C. Lando D. Hybridoma. 1992; 11: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Coincubation of IFNγ with mAb 293-4-45 dramatically reduced the binding of the cytokine to its receptor (Fig. 3 a). Coincubation of IFNγ with mAb 13-16-2 also reduced the binding but to a smaller extent (Fig. 3 b). Both mAbs were also used to probe a preformed IFNγ·IFNγR complex. For that purpose, a saturating dose of IFNγ was injected over the IFNγR surface until equilibrium was reached. The complex was then quickly washed with running buffer, after which mAbs were injected (Fig. 3 c). These data showed that mAb 13-16-2 could bind to the IFNγ·IFNγR complex, whereas mAb 293-4-45 only displayed a weak interaction. Together these results suggest that the 125–134 sequence of IFNγ becomes buried in the cytokine-receptor complex but that the 132–138 sequence remains freely accessible. To directly analyze the role of the heparin/heparan sulfate binding sequence in receptor interaction, we prepared various forms of IFNγ lacking defined domains of the carboxyl terminus, making use of the great enzymatic susceptiblility of this part of the cytokine (13Döbeli H. Gentz R. Jucker W. Garotta G. Hartmann D.W. Hochuli E. J. Biotechnol. 1988; 7: 199-216Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cleavage of IFNγ was performed with activated factor X, carboxypeptidase Y, or endoproteinase Arg-C (Fig. 4). The M r of these truncated forms of IFNγ, as measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis (Table I), were 16,254, 15,705, and 15,208 for activated factor X-, carboxypeptidase Y-, and endoproteinase Arg-C-treated IFNγ. This corresponded to molecules from which 6, 10, or 14 carboxyl-terminal amino acids were removed, and this was consistent with the known substrate specificity of the enzymes used. These molecules therefore ended at Arg137, Gln133, and Arg129and will be referred to as IFNγ137, IFNγ133, and IFNγ129 (see Fig. 4). As a control, IFNγ143 was also analyzed, and theM r obtained (16,908) was exactly theM r expected for the full-length molecule. In addition, deletion of six (IFNγ137) or 10 (IFNγ133) amino acids resulted in the expected increased antiviral activity (13Döbeli H. Gentz R. Jucker W. Garotta G. Hartmann D.W. Hochuli E. J. Biotechnol. 1988; 7: 199-216Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), while deletion of 14 (IFNγ129) or 19 (IFNγ124) amino acids resulted in the expected decreased activity for such truncated molecules (data not shown).Table ICleavage points of the IFNγ truncated formsTreatmentaFXCYArgCM r16908 ± 216254 ± 215705 ± 215208 ± 2ND1-aNot determined.Last amino acidGln143Arg137Gln133Arg129Ala124NameIFNγ143IFNγ137IFNγ133IFNγ129IFNγ1241-a Not determined. Open table in a new tab IFNγ143(full-length IFNγ), and the carboxyl termini-deleted IFNγ were injected over the biacore IFNγR surface, each with a range of concentrations to produce sets of sensorgrams from which association and dissociation phases can be analyzed. The dissociation phase started at 370 s, when the injection of IFNγ was changed to a perfusion buffer. To this part of the sensorgrams was applied a simpleAB = A + B dissociation model. A good fit was found for IFNγ124 only (Fig. 5 e), which gave an off rate in the range 4.7–5.2 × 10−3·s−1. For the others, the higher the observed on rate (see below) the worse was the fit. Presumably, the fast on rate caused a rapid rebinding of the dissociated molecules, a phenomenon that occurs as increasing numbers of free immobilized ligand (IFNγR) are regenerated at the surface of the sensor chip during the dissociation phase. Since free IFNγR, and therefore the rebinding effect, increased with time during the dissociation, only the first 60 s were used for the analysis. In addition, to prevent rebinding of dissociated molecules, soluble IFNγR was included in the perfusion buffer during dissociation (e.g. see Fig. 1 c). Including IFNγR at 10–20 μg/ml in the perfusion buffer, a simple dissociation model can now be assumed, characterized by an off rate of 5–5.6 × 10−3·s−1. Interestingly, thisk off was similar to thek off of IFNγ124 (for which no rebinding occurred). Therefore, the addition of soluble IFNγR in the perfusion buffer was effective in preventing rebinding and necessary for accurate kinetic analysis. Furthermore, these data showed that cleavages of the carboxyl terminus of IFNγ did not modify the off rate of the reaction and, thus, that the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the cytokine was not involved in the stability of the complex. During ligand injection (130–370 s), three phases can be distinguished. The first phase was diffusion-controlled (the reaction was limited by mass transport of the analyte), and, in our case, this was observed (see below) for the molecules that displayed a high on rate (IFNγ143, IFNγ137, and IFNγ133) but not for the others (IFNγ129and IFNγ124). The second phase was determined by the kinetics of the IFNγ/IFNγR interaction, and the third one was equilibrium. It was immediately apparent (see Fig. 5) that the binding rate of the reaction increased for IFNγ137 and IFNγ133, compared with full-length molecule (Fig. 5,a–c) but decreased for IFNγ129 and IFNγ124 (Fig. 5, d–e). Kinetic analysis of the binding curves was first performed with the Biaevaluation 2.1 software. As indicated above, in some cases (IFNγ143, IFNγ137, and IFNγ133), the early phase of the association was dominated by mass transport. However, as the reaction proceeds, the free binding sites decrease and the binding rate progressively depends on the intrinsic rate constant. Thus, as a first approach, when analyzing the experiments, the mass transport-limited parts of the sensorgrams were excluded from the data used for evaluation, as already reported in several other cytokine-receptor binding studies (27Johanson K. Appelbaum E. Doyle M. Hensley P. Zhao B. Abdel-Meguid S.S. Young P. Cook R. Carr S. Matico R. Cusimano D. Dul E. Angelichio M. Brooks I. Winborne E. McDonnell P. Morton T. Bennett D. Sokoloski T.

In this way, the kinetic part of each sensorgram could be confidently fitted on the basis of an A+ B = AB model, and deviations of the data points from the fitted curve were quantitatively in the range expected from the background noise. As detailed under “Materials and Methods,” analysis was performed both by nonlinear fitting and by linear transformation of the data.

https://openalex.org/W2059854086,"Recent studies suggest that some of the heparan sulfate-carrying proteoglycans may directly participate in signaling via their cytoplasmic tail. The present investigation addresses the potential involvement of syndecan-4, a widely expressed transmembrane proteoglycan, in this process. We found that the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 is phosphorylated on a single serine residue (Ser183) in growth-arrested NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, with a stoichiometry of 0.3 mol Pi/mol syndecan-4. Treatment of the cells with a protein kinase C (PKC)-activating phorbol ester lead to a 2.5-fold increase in Ser183 phosphorylation. This increase was inhibited by a generic PKC inhibitor but not by an inhibitor specific to the calcium-dependent conventional PKCs, suggesting that the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 is phosphorylated by a calcium-independent novel PKC isozyme. Application of 10–30 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) produced a 2–3-fold reduction in the phosphorylation of syndecan-4. Because treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin prevented the bFGF-induced decrease in syndecan-4 phosphorylation, the effect of bFGF appears to be mediated by a protein serine/threonine phosphatase type 1 or 2A. We conclude that the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 is subject to in vivo phosphorylation on Ser183, which is regulated by the activities of a novel PKC isozyme and a bFGF-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase."

The four cysteines in α-conotoxins form two intramolecular disulfide bridges to produce a conformationally constrained two-loop structure (Fig. 1). Muscle-specific α-conotoxins include MI, GI, and SI, while neuronal-specific toxins include ImI (CTx ImI) and MII, which target α7 and α3β2 receptors, respectively (1Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Scott J.K.

Owing to their specificity for muscle and neuronal acetylcholine receptors, α-conotoxins are valuable probes of binding sites of nicotinic AChR subtypes (4Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R.

Specificity of a particular α-conotoxin likely reflects structural differences in the various AChR binding sites. Binding sites of nicotinic AChRs are formed at interfaces between pairs of α and non-α subunits (reviewed in Ref. 8Prince R.J. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, 1998: 31-59Crossref Google Scholar). In the muscle AChR, the binding sites are formed by α1-δ, α1-γ, and α1-ε subunit pairs, whereas in the homomeric α7 AChR the binding sites are formed by pairs of identical subunits, α7-α7. Thus across the various AChR subtypes, the different binding site interfaces contribute different residues which are recognized by the various α-conotoxins. All α-conotoxins contain two disulfide bridges, proline in the first loop, and basic and aromatic residues in the second loop. However, each α-conotoxin targets a particular binding site through differences in its number and type of residues. For example, CTx ImI contains four residues in the first loop and three in the second, whereas muscle-specific conotoxins contain three residues in the first loop and five in the second. Furthermore, unlike muscle-specific conotoxins, CTx ImI contains both positively and negatively charged residues in the first loop. Thus structural differences in α-conotoxins likely reflect structural differences at the various AChR binding site interfaces. Competitive antagonists are potential probes of binding site structure that can identify residues of close approach which are distant in the linear sequence or contained in different protein subunits. When the antagonist is structurally constrained it can also serve as a molecular caliper for estimating distances between these residues. For example, previous work showed that the conformationally restricted antagonist dimethyl-d-tubocurarine bridges the α and γ subunits in the muscle receptor through interaction between its two quaternary nitrogens and tyrosines in each subunit (9Fu D.X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Given the distance between quaternary nitrogens in dimethyl-d-tubocurarine, the two tyrosines in the α and γ subunits are estimated to be 11 Å apart. Similarly, α-conotoxins are potential probes of the binding sites of muscle and neuronal AChRs. Solution and crystal structures of α-conotoxins reveal a triangular structure with positive charges at two vertices separated by 15 Å (11Pardi A. Galdes A. Florance J. Maniconte D.

Thus, by identifying active residues in CTx ImI and the α7 binding site interface, residues of close approach can be identified, and their separation can be estimated. We recently identified residues of the α7 binding site that confer neuronal specificity of CTx ImI (23Quiram P.A. Sine S.M. J. Biol.

The present paper continues our work characterizing the α7 binding site by constructing a series of CTx ImI mutants and measuring binding affinity of the mutant toxins. The results reveal two key regions in CTx ImI essential for bioactivity. 125I-Labeled α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products,d-tubocurarine chloride from ICN Pharmaceuticals, α-conotoxins MI and GI from American Peptide Co., 293 human embryonic kidney cell line (293 HEK) from the American Type Culture Collection, and α-conotoxin SI, unlabeled α-Bgt, and DTNB (5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) from Sigma. Human α7 and rat 5HT-3 subunit cDNAs were generously provided by Drs. John Lindstrom and William Green. Sources of the human acetylcholine receptor subunit cDNAs were as described previously (15Ohno K. Wang H.-L. Milone M. Bren N. Brengman J.M. Nakano S. Quiram P.A. Pruitt J.N. Sine S.M. Engel A.G.

Mutant and wild type α-conotoxin ImI were synthesized by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer. During synthesis, cysteine protecting groups (S-triphenylmethyl) were incorporated at cysteines 3 and 12, and acetamidomethyl protecting groups (ACM) were incorporated at cysteines 2 and 8. The linear peptide was purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C18 preparative column with trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile buffers. The two intramolecular disulfide bridges were formed as follows: the cysteine S-triphenylmethyl protecting groups of cysteines 3 and 12 were removed during trifluoroacetic acid cleavage of the linear peptide from the support resin, and the peptide was oxidized by molecular oxygen to form the 3–12 disulfide by stirring in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, at 25 °C for 24 h. The peptide was lyophilized prior to formation of the second disulfide bridge. The ACM protecting groups on cysteine 2 and 8 were removed oxidatively by iodine as described (16Andrue D. Albericio F.

Reactivity of each synthetic CTx ImI mutant is expressed relative to that obtained for 100 μg of non-oxidized CTx ImI (Table I). Acetylcholine receptor subunit cDNAs were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus-based expression vector pRBG4 (10Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The α7/5HT-3 chimera (α7200/5HT-3) was constructed by bridging a 58-base pair synthetic oligonucleotide from aTfiI site in human α7 to an EcoRV site in rat 5HT-3. The nucleotide sequence of the chimera was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. HEK cells were transfected with muscle or α7/5HT-3 cDNAs using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (10Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, intact cells were harvested by gentle agitation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA for ligand binding measurements. Ligand binding to intact cells was measured by competition against the initial rate of125I-α-Bgt binding (10Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The cells were briefly centrifuged, resuspended in potassium Ringer's solution, and divided into aliquots for ligand binding. Potassium Ringer's solution contains: 140 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, and 30 mg/liter bovine serum albumin, adjusted to a pH of 7.4 with 10 mm NaOH. Specified concentrations of ligand were added 30 min prior to addition of 3.75 nm125I-α-Bgt, which was allowed to bind 15 min to occupy approximately half of the surface receptors. Binding was terminated by addition of 2 ml of potassium Ringer's solution containing 600 μm d-tubocurarine chloride. All experiments were performed at 24 ± 2 °C. Cells were harvested by filtration through Whatman GF-B filters using a Brandel Cell Harvester and washed three times with 3 ml of potassium Ringer's solution. Prior to use, filters were soaked in potassium Ringer's solution containing 4% skim milk. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 nm α-Bgt and was typically 1% of the total number of binding sites. The total number of binding sites was determined by incubation with toxin for 120 min. The initial rate of toxin binding was calculated as described (17Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield the fractional occupancy of competing ligand. Binding measurements were analyzed according to either the monophasic Hill equation (Equation 1) or the sum of two distinct binding sites (Equation 2), 1−Y=1/(1+([ligand]/Kapp)nH)Equation 1 1−Y=fractA(1/(1+[ligand]/KA))+(1−fractA)(1/(1+[ligand]/KB))Equation 2 where Y is fractional occupancy of the competing ligand, K app is the apparent dissociation constant, n H is the Hill coefficient,K A and K B are intrinsic dissociation constants for two binding sites, and fract A is the fraction of sites with dissociation constant K A . Fitted parameters and standard errors were obtained using UltraFit (BIOSOFT). For multiple experiments, means of the individual fitted parameters and standard deviations are presented (Tables II andIII).Table IIApparent affinities of conotoxins ImI, GI, MI, and SI for α 7 /5HT-3 and human α 2 βεδ receptorsK appn HK AK BnμmμmμmHuman α7/5HT-3 CTx ImI2.38 ± 0.50.85 ± 0.0210 CTx GI685 ± 370.88 ± 0.042 CTx MI86 ± 4.30.89 ± 0.032 CTx SI634 ± 220.89 ± 0.082Human α2βεδ CTx ImI119 ± 4.01.1 ± 0.0654.4 ± 0.9264 ± 133 CTx GI0.02 ± 0.0030.58 ± 0.050.14 ± 0.0050.002 ± 0.00015 CTx MI0.03 ± 0.0010.85 ± 0.020.09 ± 0.0090.009 ± 0.0015 CTx SI0.7 ± 0.070.49 ± 0.050.08 ± 0.0148.31 ± 1.25 Open table in a new tab Table IIIBinding parameters of conotoxin ImI mutants for α 7 /5HT-3 receptorsCTx ImI mutantsK appn HnμmWild type CTx ImI2.38 ± 0.50.85 ± 0.0210Acetylated G14.25 ± 0.20.95 ± 0.044S4A3.77 ± 0.20.87 ± 0.014D5N262 ± 100.85 ± 0.034D5E616 ± 390.88 ± 0.044D5K1890 ± 670.92 ± 0.054P6G140 ± 160.86 ± 0.064P6A120 ± 90.96 ± 0.074P6V250 ± 131.00 ± 0.014R7Q924 ± 540.95 ± 0.054R7K290 ± 130.95 ± 0.044R7E1650 ± 1050.87 ± 0.064A9S1.90 ± 0.20.89 ± 0.054W10F9.90 ± 1.00.96 ± 0.074W10T63.8 ± 5.51.00 ± 0.094R11Q3.78 ± 0.40.97 ± 0.074D5R + R7D4540 ± 2390.88 ± 0.094 Open table in a new tab Studies of the homomeric α7 binding site have been limited by low expression of native α7 in mammalian cells (18Cooper S.T. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To increase expression, we and others constructed α7/5HT-3 chimeras containing the extracellular domain of α7 joined to the M1 junction of the rat 5HT-3 receptor (19Eiselé J.L. Bertrand S.

We showed that the extracellular domain of human α7 maintained the ligand recognition properties of wild type human α7, but that the presence of 5HT-3 sequence greatly enhanced expression (23Quiram P.A. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11001-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine affinities of the CTx ImI mutants described in the present study, we measured binding to α7/5HT-3 receptors expressed in 293 HEK cells. Wild type and mutants of CTx ImI were synthesized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Molecular weights of each toxin were determined by mass spectrometry and compared with calculated molecular weights (TableI). The close agreement between measured and calculated molecular weights supports the amino acid compositions and formation of the two intramolecular disulfide bonds. To further confirm that both disulfide bonds formed, we assayed for free sulfhydryls using the colorimetric reaction of DTNB. Whereas the linear, nonoxidized CTx ImI reacted strongly with DTNB, neither the commercially available CTx MI nor any of the CTx ImI mutants reacted (Table I). Thus the mass spectrometry data combined with DTNB assay confirm that the wild type and mutant conotoxins are fully oxidized. To establish that CTx ImI shows the correct neuronal specificity for our α7/5HT-3 chimera, we compared binding of CTx ImI with that of the muscle-specific conotoxins by competition against the initial rate of 125I-labeled α-Bgt binding. As observed in other expression systems (21Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar), CTx ImI binds with much higher affinity to α7/5HT-3 receptors than CTx MI, GI, or SI (Fig. 2, top panel and TableII). We further examined neuronal specificity of CTx ImI by comparing it to the muscle-specific α-conotoxins in binding to human adult muscle receptors. Whereas CTx MI, GI, and SI bind with high affinity to muscle receptors, CTx ImI binds with much lower affinity (Fig. 2, bottom panel and Table II). In addition, conotoxins GI and SI select between the two sites of the muscle receptor, with the two-site fit revealing dissociation constants different by 70- and 100-fold, respectively (Table II). By contrast, the monophasic binding of conotoxins ImI and MI indicate similar affinities for both binding sites of the muscle receptor; the two-site fit reveals dissociation constants different by only 5- and 10-fold for CTx ImI and MI, respectively. Thus, our α7/5HT-3 receptor and CTx ImI show the expected neuronal specificity. We introduced conservative substitutions for each non-cysteine residue in CTx ImI, and measured binding of each mutant toxin to α7/5HT-3 receptors. The results reveal two key regions in CTx ImI essential for high affinity binding (Fig. 3 and TableIII). The first region is the triad Asp-Pro-Arg in the first loop, where individual mutations decrease affinity by 70–500-fold. The second region is the single tryptophan in the second loop, which when mutated to threonine decreases affinity by 30-fold. On the other hand, mutating the four remaining non-cysteines in CTx ImI does not significantly alter affinity for α7/5HT-3 receptors. These mutations include acetylation of the amino-terminal glycine and neutralization of arginine in the second loop (R11Q). Thus mutation of four of the eight non-cysteines in CTx ImI alters affinity for α7/5HT-3 receptors. To determine the chemical nature of the contributions of each of the four essential residues in CTx ImI, we introduced a systematic series of side chains at each position and measured binding of each mutant toxin to α7/5HT-3 receptors (Fig. 4). Beginning with aspartic acid at position 5, neutralization by substituting asparagine decreases affinity by 100-fold, as described above (Fig. 3). However, replacement with glutamic acid, which lengthens the side chain but maintains the negative charge, decreases affinity even more. Introducing the positively charged lysine produces the greatest decrease of affinity at position 5. These results demonstrate that a negative charge and correct side chain length are required at position 5, suggesting an interaction with a focal electron acceptor in the receptor binding site. We next examined the remaining charged residue of the triad, arginine at position 7. Surprisingly, maintaining the positive charge by mutation to lysine decreases affinity 100-fold, similar to the decrease observed by mutation to the neutral glutamine (R7Q in Fig. 3). Introducing the negatively charged glutamic acid produces the greatest decrease of affinity at position 7. Thus the structural requirements at position 7 are analogous to those at position 5. A positive charge with particular size is required, suggesting interaction with an electron-rich subsite in the receptor. We considered the possibility that Asp-5 and Arg-7 form an intramolecular salt bridge essential for activity of CTx ImI. Thus we switched the positions of the two charged residues with the mutation D5R + R7D, with the goal of maintaining the salt bridge of the native toxin. The double mutant toxin decreases affinity by 2000-fold, the greatest decrease observed, indicating that either the salt bridge is not formed, or a salt bridge between Asp-5 and Arg-7 is not the basis for high affinity. The third member of the triad, proline at position 6, is conserved in all α-conotoxins described to date. The large decrease in affinity produced by the mutation P6G (Fig. 3) suggests that proline orients the side chains of Arg-7 and Asp-5 for optimal interaction with the receptor binding site. Because glycine contributes only a hydrogen side chain, we constructed P6A and P6V to increase side chain size to approach that of proline. Both P6A and P6V mutations decrease affinity similar to P6G, suggesting that conformational restriction by proline at position 6 is required for high affinity binding to the α7 receptor. The second essential region is the lone tryptophan in the second loop at position 10, which when mutated to threonine decreases affinity by 30-fold (Fig. 3). To determine whether aromaticity is required at position 10, we exchanged tryptophan for phenylalanine. Affinity of the W10F mutant decreases only 3-fold compared with CTx ImI, indicating that an aromatic side chain is required at position 10. The overall results reveal active residues in both loops of CTx ImI. The first loop contains a triad of residues that requires specific charge, side chain length, and conformational restriction. The second loop contains a tryptophan which contributes its aromatic ring to stabilize the α7-CTx ImI complex. To investigate the basis of specificity of CTx ImI for neuronal α7 receptors, we used α7/5HT-3 chimeras to express α7 binding sites and to measure binding affinity of a series of CTx ImI mutants. The results reveal two regions of CTx ImI that confer specificity for human neuronal α7receptors. The first region is the conformationally sensitive triad Asp-Pro-Arg within the first loop of CTx ImI. Subtle changes in side chain lengths of the aspartic acid and arginine reduce affinity, and their side chains appear to be held in place by the intervening proline. Thus, the triad must maintain a specific conformation to fit properly into a specific and focal counterpart in the α7binding site. The second region is the single tryptophan within the second loop of CTx ImI. Studies of side chain specificity at position 10 indicate the requirement of an aromatic ring. Mutagenesis and site directed labeling studies establish that each ligand binding site in muscle and neuronal AChRs contains contributions from both α and non-α subunits. Residues of the α portion of the binding site, termed the (+) face, are located in three regions well separated in the primary sequence, suggesting a three-loop model of the (+) face of the binding site (reviewed in Refs. 8Prince R.J. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, 1998: 31-59Crossref Google Scholar and 22Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similarly, residues of the non-α portion of the binding site, termed the (−) face, are located in four separate regions of the primary sequence, suggesting a four loop model for the (−) face of the binding site (8Prince R.J. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, 1998: 31-59Crossref Google Scholar,22Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Unlike the two binding sites of the muscle AChR, which are formed at interfaces between α1-δ and either α1-γ (fetal) or α1-ε (adult) subunit pairs, binding sites of the homo-oligomeric α7 receptor are formed at interfaces between pairs of identical subunits, α7-α7. Consequences of a homo-oligomeric pentamer include the potential for five binding sites and formation of both the (+) and (−) faces by a single α7 subunit. α-CTx ImI is a competitive antagonist of neuronal α7receptors. It contains two disulfide bonds which hold the toxin in a constrained two-loop structure. The solution and crystal structures of members of the α-conotoxin family reveal a compact triangular structure with two positive charges separated by 15 Å, similar to the rigid structure and 11 Å separation of quaternary nitrogens of curariform antagonists. Previous work showed that curariform antagonists bridge the interface between the α and γ subunits of the muscle receptor through quaternary-aromatic interactions (9Fu D.X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the two loops of CTx ImI likely bridge the (+) and (−) faces of the α7 binding site. Because CTx ImI is small enough for structural determination at atomic resolution, it may be used as a molecular caliper to estimate distances between points of ligand contact at the α7 binding site. Our studies reveal two distinct regions in CTx ImI essential for binding to neuronal α7 receptors. The first region is within the first loop of CTx ImI, the conformationally-sensitive triad Asp-Pro-Arg. Previous studies with CTx MI demonstrated the importance of proline in the first loop, where the mutation P6G reduced biopotency approximately 100-fold (14Hashimoto K. Uchida S. Yoshida H. Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S. Yukari K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 118 (154): 351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because our results with CTx ImI reveal a similar decrease in affinity with P6G, and because Pro-6 is conserved in all α-conotoxins, the proline likely contributes to structural rigidity along with the two disulfide bridges. Aside from Pro-6, no other essential residues have been reported in the first loop of the α-conotoxins. For CTx ImI, we show that aspartic acid at position 5 and arginine at position 7 are essential for high affinity binding. Surprisingly, conservative substitutions of Asp-5 and Arg-7 markedly diminish activity of CTx ImI. The substitutions D5E and R7K, which alter side chain length by one methyl group while maintaining charge, reduce affinity more than 100-fold. In addition, introducing opposite charges at Asp-5 and Arg-7 reduces affinity approximately 1000-fold, suggesting repulsion by residues at the α7 binding site. The overall results of the Asp-5 and Arg-7 side chain experiments suggest that both charge and side chain length are important for the activity of CTx ImI. Together with residue Pro-6, Asp-5, and Arg-7 form a conformationally sensitive triad essential for CTx ImI affinity. Our results do not distinguish whether P6 contributes directly to CTx ImI binding or structurally stabilizes the first loop. However, the presence of a glycine mutation at position 6 likely allows rotational freedom around its α carbon that would affect the orientation of the side chains of Asp-5 and Arg-7. The second essential region in CTx ImI is the single Trp at position 10 of the second loop. Mutation of the two remaining non-cysteines in the second loop fails to affect CTx ImI affinity. Similar to CTx ImI, the muscle-specific conotoxins contain a conserved aromatic residue in the penultimate position of the second loop (Fig. 1). Tryptophan of CTx ImI occupies the position equivalent to that of tyrosine in CTx MI, GI, and SI. Replacement of l-tyrosine with d-tyrosine in CTx MI decreases bioactivity, indicating that the conformation of the tyrosine is essential (14Hashimoto K. Uchida S. Yoshida H. Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S. Yukari K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 118 (154): 351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our results show that converting tryptophan to threonine in CTx ImI reduces affinity 30-fold. However, converting tryptophan to phenylalanine, which maintains the aromatic side chain, decreases affinity only 3-fold. Thus an aromatic side chain at position 10 stabilizes the CTx ImI-α7 receptor complex. Surprisingly, mutations similar to those that affect affinity of muscle α-conotoxins do not affect affinity of CTx ImI. For example, a cationic side chain in the second loop is critical for activity of the muscle-specific α-conotoxins MI and SI (6Hann R.M. Pagán O.R. Gregory L.M. Jácome T. Eterovic V.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9051-9056Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Groebe D.R. Gray W.R. Abramson S.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6469-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results with CTx ImI show no effect of the mutation R11Q. In addition, previous work suggested that the N-terminal amide stabilizes the toxin-receptor complex through a π-cation interaction (12Kobayashi Y. Ohkubo T. Kyogoku Y. Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S. Braun W. Go N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4853-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By contrast, acetylation of the amino-terminal glycine does not affect affinity of CTx ImI for α7 receptors. The overall results reveal two structural motifs in CTx ImI that confer high affinity binding to α7 receptors. Knowledge of the precise contacts between CTx ImI and α7 awaits experiments that mutate residues in both the toxin and the receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2143411481,"In previous works we have identified genes in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi whose structure resemble those of mammalian mucin genes. Indirect evidence suggested that these genes might encode the core protein of parasite mucins, glycoproteins that were proposed to be involved in the interaction with, and invasion of, mammalian host cells. We now show that the mucin gene family from T. cruzi is much larger and diverse than expected. A minimal number of 484 mucin genes per haploid genome is calculated for a parasite clone. Most, if not all, genes are transcribed, as deduced from cDNA analysis. Comparison of the cDNA sequences showed evidences of a high mutation rate in localized regions of the genes. Sequence conservation among members of the family is much higher in the untranslated (UTR) regions than in the sequences encoding the mature mucin core protein. Transcription units can be classified into two main subfamilies according to the sequence homologies in the 5′-UTR, whereas the 3′-UTR is highly conserved in all clones analyzed. The common origin of members of this gene family as well as their relationships can be defined by sequence comparison of different domains in the transcription units. The regions encoding the N and C termini, supposed to correspond to the leader peptide and membrane-anchoring signal, respectively, (Di Noia, J. M., Sánchez, D. O., and Frasch, A. C. C. (1995)J.

These regions encode the target sites for O-glycosylation and are made of a variable number of repetitive units rich in Thr and Pro residues or are nonrepetitive but still rich in Thr/Ser and Pro residues. The region putatively coding for the N-terminal domain of the mature core protein is hypervariable, being different in most of the transcripts sequenced. Nonrepetitive central domains are unique to each gene. Gene-specific probes show that the relative abundance of different mRNAs varies greatly within the same parasite clone.

Nonrepetitive central domains are unique to each gene. Gene-specific probes show that the relative abundance of different mRNAs varies greatly within the same parasite clone. Mucins are highly glycosylated proteins in which the oligosaccharide chains are attached to the hydroxyl group of Thr and/or Ser residues. The core protein of most mucins is characterized by the presence of a variable central domain with repetitive amino acid units rich in Ser/Thr and Pro residues flanked by nonrepetitive N and C termini (1Gum Jr., J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Mucins have relevant roles in protection of epithelial cells and cell-cell interaction in higher organisms (2Jentoft N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 291-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Trypanosoma cruzi, the unicellular parasite agent of Chagas disease, also expresses mucin-like molecules. Mucins are present at the parasite surface in all the developmental stages: epimastigote (3Previato J.O. Jones C. Gonçalves L.P.B. Wait R. Travassos L.R. Mendoça-Previato L. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), metacyclic trypomastigote (4Schenkman S. Ferguson M.A.J. Heise N. Cardoso de Almeida M.L. Mortara R.A. Yoshida N. Mol. Biochem.

J. 1994; 304: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). They are linked to the surface membrane through a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor and are likely to be shed into the medium during the cell invasion process (4Schenkman S. Ferguson M.A.J. Heise N. Cardoso de Almeida M.L. Mortara R.A. Yoshida N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 5Camargo M.M. Almeida I.C. Pereira M.E. Ferguson M.A.J. Travassos L.R. Gazzinelli R.T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5890-5901PubMed Google Scholar). These parasite glycoproteins seem to have essential functions and unusual characteristics. T. cruzi mucins were suggested to be involved in the invasion of host cells by the parasite (7Yoshida N. Mortara R. Araguth M.F. Gonzales J.C. Russo M. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ruiz R.C. Rigoni V.L. Gonzales J. Yoshida N. Parasite Immunol.

Immun. 1997; 65: 2548-2554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an essential step for parasite multiplication and survival in mammals. Recently, T. cruzi mucins were shown to stimulate synthesis of interleukin 12 and tumor necrosis factor α cytokines by macrophages (5Camargo M.M. Almeida I.C. Pereira M.E. Ferguson M.A.J. Travassos L.R. Gazzinelli R.T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5890-5901PubMed Google Scholar). One unusual structural feature of this parasite mucins is that the first sugar attached to the Ser/Thr residues is notN-acetylgalactosamine but N-acetylglucosamine (3Previato J.O. Jones C. Gonçalves L.P.B. Wait R. Travassos L.R. Mendoça-Previato L. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Another rather surprising finding is the possible large number of different mucins in the parasite. Biochemical evidence suggested the existence of two groups of glycoproteins: those of apparent molecular mass 35–50 kDa (10Mortara R.A. da Silva S. Araguth M.F. Blanco S.A. Yoshida N. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4673-4678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and others producing a large smear in Western blots from 80 to 200 kDa (6Almeida I.C. Ferguson M.A.J. Schenkman S. Travassos L.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Schenkman S. Jiang M.S. Hart G.W. Nussenzweig V. Cell. 1991; 65: 1117-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The recent identification of genes encoding the parasite core protein (12Reyes M.B. Pollevick G.D. Frasch A.C.C. Gene. 1994; 140: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Di Noia J.M. Pollevick G.D. Xavier M.T. Previato J.O. Mendoça-Previato L. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32078-32083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) confirmed the existence of a gene family (14Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Salazar N. Mondragón A. Kelly J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), although the number of members has not been estimated yet. The first T. cruzi gene isolated was shown to encode a small protein of about 16 kDa having a repetitive central domain with the consensus sequence Thr8-Lys-Pro2 flanked by nonrepetitive N and C termini (12Reyes M.B. Pollevick G.D. Frasch A.C.C. Gene. 1994; 140: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Characterization of a number of genes showed that, whereas flanking regions were conserved among strains, the central domain might vary greatly in the number of repeat units and that there is a second group of genes lacking repeats, with a variable central domain still rich in Thr and Pro and also in Ser residues. The multigene family was named TcMUC for T. cruzi and in analogy with vertebrate mucin genes. Interestingly, some of these genes seem to be genetically linked to trans-sialidase (15Salazar N. Mondragón A. Kelly J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the enzyme that transfers sialic acid to the parasite mucins (11Schenkman S. Jiang M.S.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1705-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although indirect, several evidences suggest that these genes indeed encode the core protein of parasite mucins as follows. 1) Deduced amino acidic composition and structure is typical of apo-mucins (14Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 2) Antibodies to a recombinant protein derived from a TcMUC gene and a monoclonal antibody directed against a carbohydrate epitope present inT. cruzi mucins detected the same bands in Western blots (13Di Noia J.M. Pollevick G.D. Xavier M.T. Previato J.O. Mendoça-Previato L. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32078-32083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 3) When transfected into an eukaryotic cell, one TcMUCgene renders a product likely to be highly O-glycosylated (13Di Noia J.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32078-32083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 4) It has been recently shown that a peptide derived from the sequence of TcMUC repetitive genes is a very good substrate for an UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:peptide-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity thought to be the first enzyme involved inO-glycosylation machinery in T. cruzi. 1J. O. Previato and L. Mendoça Previato, personal communication. 1J. O. Previato and L. Mendoça Previato, personal communication. In this work we have identified a number of different mRNAs transcribed from a minimal estimate of 484 mucin genes present inT. cruzi. Although untranslated regions and some coding regions are highly conserved among members of this large family, definite coding regions are very variable; in particular, those encoding the mature N termini of the mucin core proteins. CL-Brener cloned stock (17Brener Z. Chiari E. Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. Sao Paulo. 1963; 5: 220-224PubMed Google Scholar) epimastigotes (a form of the parasite similar to the one present in the insect vector) were grown in brain-heart infusion medium (18Cazzulo J.J. Franke de Cazzulo B.M. Engel J.C. Cannata J.J.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cell-derived trypomastigotes (a form similar to that present in the mammalian bloodstream) were grown in Vero cell culture (19Zingales B. Katzin A.M. Arruda M.V. Colli W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). DNA was prepared from epimastigotes of T. cruzi using conventional proteinase K phenol/chloroform method (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA from the epimastigote and trypomastigote forms was prepared using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's indications or by the CsCl/guanidinium isothiocyanate method (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). A previously described genomic T. cruzi cosmid library constructed in the Lawrist7 vector and spotted into high density arrayed filters was used (22Hanke J. Sánchez D.O. Henriksson J. Åslund L. Petterson U. Frasch A.C.C. Hoheisel J.D. Biotechniques. 1996; 21: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The library and filters were kindly provided by Dr. J. Hoheisel (Heidelberg, Germany). The filters used contained 33,792 cosmid clones that, for an average insert size of 37 kilobase pairs, yielded a 22.7-genome coverage for an haploid genome size of 55·106base pairs (23Thompson C.T. Dvorak J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This library has been previously hybridized with a number of different probes (22Hanke J. Sánchez D.O. Henriksson J. Åslund L. Petterson U. Frasch A.C.C. Hoheisel J.D. Biotechniques. 1996; 21: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hybridization conditions used with the different probes were 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml tRNA at 65 °C. Three washes using 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) were done at 65 °C. High specific activity probes were labeled by PCR 2The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcription; UTR, untranslated region; nt, nucleotide(s); ORF, open reading frame; HV, hypervariable. using [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) as described elsewhere (24Mertz L.M. Rashtchian A. Focus. 1994; 16: 45-48Google Scholar). Primers and templates used for labeling probes were as follows: complete gene probe on MUC.CA-2 (14Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), P1 (5′-CCATGTTCCTCACTGTGTAGAT-3′) and P2 (5′-ACATCGGACCACGGTAGAAGTA-3′); repeats probe on MUC.M/76 (12Reyes M.B. Pollevick G.D. Frasch A.C.C. Gene. 1994; 140: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), R3′ (5′-TGTAGTCGTAATGCTTGGTGC-3′) and R5′ (5′-ACAGAAAGTGGTCAGGAGGAA-3′); central-1j3 probe on EMUCe-1j3, 1j3/S.E. (5′-CGGAGAAGCCTAAAGTTG-3′) and 1j3/as (5′-CGAAACATCGCTGAGACTT-3′); central-t6 probe on EMUCt-6, RAI11+ (5′-CGGTCAGTCACAGCTACAA-3′) and RAI11- (5′-GGTCGTGGTCGTAGTCGTA-3′); central-t5 probe on EMUCt-5, 36/S.E. (5′-ACAGCGAATGGTGGGTCTA-3′) and EMT5/as (5′-TTTGAGGAGGCTTCTGCTT-3′). Southern and Northern blots were as described elsewhere (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Both were transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) and UV cross-linked. The hybridization solution was 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 3× SSC (0.45 m NaCl, 0.045m sodium citrate). Washes were always at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. A normalized cDNA library constructed from epimastigotes of the CL-Brener clone and provided by Dr. E. Rondinelli (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) had previously been ordered into 384-well microtiter plates. Replica filters of this cDNA library were hybridized using the complete MUC.CA-2 gene as probe. The gene within the insert was PCR-amplified using the primers P1 and P2 and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using MegaPrime (Amersham). The hybridization was performed in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml tRNA at 65 °C. The filters were washed in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 65 °C for 2 h. The screening yielded 48 positive clones of different strengths in hybridization signals. Out of these, 29 were fully or partially sequenced. Reverse transcription was performed on total RNA from epimastigotes and cell-derived trypomastigotes using the Superscript kit following manufacturer instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primer P2 (14Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was used for cDNA synthesis designed on the conserved 3′ extragenic regions of available sequences and positioned at about 70 base pairs downstream of the stop codon. Due to the low temperature necessary to perform the reverse transcription reaction, that allowed a low stringency for priming and hence some nonspecific cDNA synthesis, hemi-nested PCR was carried out. The first PCR reaction was done with a spliced leader primer named ME33 (5′-AACTAACGCTATTATTGATA-3′) and the P2 primer. For the second PCR, primer ME33 and a primer internal to P2 position named STOP (5′-TCAGCCCAGAGTGGTGTACGC-3′) because it contained the stop codon of the genes, were used. PCR products were ligated into pGEM-T vector (Promega). Positive clones were identified by hybridization with MUC.CA-2 probe in high stringency conditions (0.1× SSC, 65 °C). Thirty clones obtained with primers ME33-STOP and ME33-P2 were sequenced. A total of 59 clones containing total or partial mRNA corresponding to T. cruzi mucin genes were obtained using the two strategies described above. From the library screening, 29 positive clones were isolated and partially or fully sequenced. In 13 of these clones, the cDNA spanned the region from the poly(A) tail to that encoding the signal peptide or even to the 5′-UTR, and in 3 of them, the trans-splicing acceptor site could be determined. The remaining 16 clones had the 3′-UTR, the region corresponding to the C terminus and a variable part of the central region. For RT-PCR, we took advantage of the fact that all mRNA of trypanosomatids are matured at their 5′ end by trans-splicing, a process in which a 39-nt invariable sequence called spliced leader is attached to the 5′ end of the primary transcripts. From this strategy, 30 clones containing a complete ORF were analyzed, 13 corresponding to epimastigotes and 17 to trypomastigotes. All clones were named EMUC for expressed mucin gene, and EMUCe- and EMUCt- indicates if they were derived from epimastigote or trypomastigote stages, respectively. Those obtained from RT-PCR are identified by a number code (i.e.EMUCe-1, EMUCt-18), and those from library screening, by an alphanumeric code (i.e. EMUCe-24p20). As the “Results” section mainly deals with MUC family variability, transcripts are grouped without further specification of their source except when specified. Sequencing was performed using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and an ABI 373 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). All sequence computational analyses were done using Lasergene package from DNAstar INC. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from T. cruzi CL-Brener clone probed with a complete mucin gene showed a very complex pattern (not shown) similar to the one seen for all the other strains tested (14Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This suggested a large number of genes as being part of this family. To estimate this number, hybridizations using high stringency conditions were conducted onto high density filter arrays of the CL-Brener cosmid library generated for mapping of the T. cruzi genome (Ref. 22Hanke J. Sánchez D.O. Henriksson J. Åslund L. Petterson U. Frasch A.C.C. Hoheisel J.D. Biotechniques. 1996; 21: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, see “Experimental Procedures”). There were 242 positive clones/haploid genome for a probe containing the complete mucin gene MUC.CA-2 (14Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To estimate a number of mucin genes per cosmid clone, the EcoRI restriction patterns of 22 randomly chosen cosmid clones were analyzed by hybridization with the same probe (Fig. 1). None of the genes analyzed so far have an internal EcoRI site. In every lane, at least two bands large enough to contain a whole gene gave strong hybridization signals; in addition, several other weaker bands were observed in each clone. Consequently, we estimated a minimal number of 2 mucin genes per positive cosmid to obtain a minimal, and almost surely underestimated, gene number of 484 per haploid genome. Similar hybridizations were made on the library filters using central regions of different cDNAs from mucin genes (described below). A probe derived from one of the genes whose central domain is made up of repetitive amino acid units detected 32 cosmids per haploid genome, indicating that an important proportion of the mucin genes has this kind of central region. A second group of mucin genes has central domains lacking repetitive units. Three central region probes (EMUCt-5, EMUCe-1j3, and EMUCt-6; see below) that do not cross-react in hybridizations under stringent conditions gave 1–3 positive cosmids/haploid genome. Thus, we concluded that they likely detected single-copy members within the family. The unusually high number of genes found and the diversity suggested by hybridization experiments raised the question of which of them were actually transcribed in a single parasite clone and what was the structure of the transcripts. To answer these questions, 59 cDNA clones were analyzed. They were identified in a cDNA library (29 clones) or obtained by RT-PCR (30 clones) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The overall structure of the clones and that of the deduced proteins is described in the next sections. The analysis of 36 5′-UTRs allowed us to group transcripts into two main subfamilies, which were named types A and B. This region comprises the first base after the spliced leader to the last base before the translation initiation codon. Both groups differ in length and share no significant sequence similarity but are very conserved within each group. The type A 5′-UTR shows three different lengths of 19, 34, and 29 nt due to point mutations that change the starting Met and to the use of different trans-splicing acceptor sites (Fig. 2). Using the same criteria, the type B 5′-UTR varies between 41 and 49 nt. The A group was much more frequent than the B group; 30 and 6 members of each kind were identified, respectively. In both groups, alternative trans-splicing acceptor sites were found (Fig. 2), but as the genomic sequence is not available, it is not possible to determine if an alternative AG acceptor site is being used or the major acceptor site is not conserved. On the other hand, 3′-UTR showed much more similarity among all studied sequences (not shown). Sequence comparison of all available 3′-UTRs (29 clones) rendered a fairly homogeneous grouping. The length from the stop codon to the poly(A) start was about 350 nt. The percentage of homology ranged from 60.2 to 88% when the first 250 nt of these regions were aligned. The last portion, before the poly(A) attachment site, of all 3′-UTRs studied was always very rich in uridine . The coding sequence of MUC transcripts (Fig. 3) in all cases showed a sequence previously postulated to be the signal peptide for endoplasmic reticulum import (14Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This region is highly conserved, with amino acid identities from 80 to 100% among different variants. This peptide, whose size ranges from 23 to 28 amino acid residues, is very rich in Cys, with 6 of these residues in conserved positions. Cleavage site predictions based in current models (25von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar) suggest the 6th of these Cys residue as a good candidate. It is therefore used in this analysis as the border between the signal peptide and the putative mature N terminus. Additionally, this Cys was conserved in all but one of 39 sequences analyzed. The next few amino acids after the signal peptide would constitute the mature N terminus of the proteins once expressed in their final cellular destination and shown to be the most interesting region of the protein. Fig. 4 clearly illustrates the variability existing in this region that led us to name it the hypervariable (HV) region. For repeats-containing sequences, it was defined as the amino acids between the 6th Cys residue and the start of repeated elements. The lengths of these HV regions varied between 7 and 17 amino acids. In nonrepeated products, to facilitate comparisons this region was arbitrarily defined as the 15 amino acids following the signal peptide last residue. The sequence of HV regions was available in 34 of the isolated clones, from which 28 variants were determined; some of them being obviously related but gradually diverged to be totally different in some cases. In Fig. 4, all the variants available from CL-Brener are compared, arranged to show the gradual divergence. A common feature of all these sequences is that they are highly polar and hence hydrophilic. All of them have at least one and very often more than one acidic residue (both Asp and Glu). The presence of a positively charged residues (most frequently Lys) is also common in most of them as well as a clear abundance of uncharged polar amino acids (Thr, Ser, Asn, and Gln). The origin of this diversity is addressed in the next section. After the HV region, there is a central domain having the target sites for O-glycosylation. Forty six out of 51 sequences isolated in which the central region was available differed in this central domain. The deduced amino acid sequence allowed classification of clones into the two main groups we reported earlier (14Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), those having central domains composed of tandemly repeated elements and the ones lacking repetitive central domains. These results clearly demonstrate the intrastrain diversity for the central region of TcMUCgenes. Twenty-seven clones coding for proteins with repeats representing 23 different variants for the central region were identified. The consensus repeat has the sequence Thr8-Lys-Pro2, but other repeats with the sequences Asn-Thr7-Lys-Pro2, Thr8-Lys-Ala-Pro, or Thr8-Gln-Ala-Pro were also identified. Codon usage for Thr indicated a high rate of synonymous mutation in this region. The deduced sequence from other 24 clones in which central regions were determined didn't present repetitive units. From this last group, 23 variants can be identified having regions with scarce homology (less than 25% amino acid similarity). Besides being rich in Thr and Pro residues, central domains lacking repetitive units are also rich in Ser residues. In fact, the ratio Thr/Ser is around two in genes lacking repeats, whereas Ser residues are hardly found in any of the central regions of genes with repetitive motifs. One of these nonrepetitive variants represented by three clones isolated independently by both strategies was totally new and delineated a third group within TcMUC genes. The deduced protein sequence lacked the degenerated repeats and Thr runs that all the others genes had (see Fig. 3 for a comparison of the three groups and their features). However, members of this third group conserved the same overall structure in terms of amino acid content (34% Ser + Thr, 10.6% Pro, and 27.6% Ala + Gly, for the protein excluding signal peptide and glycophosphatidylinositol anchor signal) and hydrophilicity profile. Finally, all the clones except those in the third group mentioned before (see Fig. 3) coded for a conserved C terminus highly homologous to those previously described (14Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Due to the high number of sequences analyzed, it can be further dissected in two regions (Fig. 3): a hydrophilic Thr-rich region that varied from 10 to 24 amino acids because of differences in the number of Thr residues and a hydrophobic region of 36 to 38 amino acids. The latter contains an amino acid stretch with the features of a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor signal (26McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Evidences of localized mutation came from comparison of two highly homologous mucin sequences. In a previous work we reported the genomic clone MUC.RA-1, isolated from the RA strain of the parasite (13Di Noia J.M. Pollevick G.D. Xavier M.T. Previato J.O. Mendoça-Previato L. Sánchez D.O.

To provide passive immunity, 18 lines of transgenic mice secreting a recombinant monoclonal antibody (Mab) neutralizing transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) into the milk were generated. The genes encoding a chimeric Mab with the variable modules of the murine TGEV-specific Mab 6A.C3 and the constant modules of a human IgG1, isotype Mab were expressed under the control of regulatory sequences derived from the whey acidic protein, which is an abundant milk protein. The Mab 6A.C3 binds to a highly conserved epitope present in coronaviruses of several species, which does not allow the selection of neutralization escape mutants. Antibody expression titers of 106 were obtained in the milk of transgenic mice that reduced TGEV infectivity 106-fold. The antibody was synthesized at high levels throughout lactation. Integration of matrix attachment region sequences with the antibody genes led to a 20- to 10,000-fold increase in the antibody titer in 50% of the transgenic animals. Antibody expression levels were transgene copy number independent and related to the site of integration. The generation of transgenic animals producing virus neutralizing antibodies in milk could provide an approach to protection against neonatal infections of the enteric tract."
https://openalex.org/W2040211878,"Recently, we reported the cloning of the nuclear orphan receptor TAK1. In this study, we characterized the sequence requirements for optimal TAK1 binding and analyzed the repression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) signaling pathway by TAK1. Site selection analysis showed that TAK1 has the greatest affinity for direct repeat-1 response elements (RE) containing AGGTCAAAGGTCA (TAK1-RE) to which it binds as a homodimer. TAK1 is a very weak inducer of TAK1-RE-dependent transcriptional activation. We observed that TAK1, as PPARα, is expressed within rat hepatocytes and is able to bind the peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) present in the promoter of the PPARα target genes rat enoyl-CoA hydratase (HD) and peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX). TAK1 is unable to induce PPRE-dependent transcriptional activation and represses PPARα-mediated transactivation through these elements in a dose-dependent manner. Two-hybrid analysis showed that TAK1 does not form heterodimers with either PPARα or retinoid X receptor (RXRα), indicating that this repression does not involve a mechanism by which TAK1 titrates out PPARα or RXRα from PPAR·RXR complexes. Further studies demonstrated that the PPARα ligand 8(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid strongly promotes the interaction of PPARα with the co-activator RIP-140 but decreases the interaction of PPARα with the co-repressor SMRT. In contrast, TAK1 interacts with RIP-140 but not with SMRT and competes with PPARα for RIP-140 binding. These observations indicated that the antagonistic effects of TAK1 on PPARα·RXRα transactivation act at least at two levels in the PPARα signaling pathway: competition of TAK1 with PPARα·RXR for binding to PPREs as well as to common co-activators, such as RIP-140. Our results suggest an important role for TAK1 in modulating PPARα-controlled gene expression in hepatocytes. Recently, we reported the cloning of the nuclear orphan receptor TAK1.

In this study, we characterized the sequence requirements for the consensus TAK1 response element (TAK1-RE) and demonstrated that TAK1 homodimers bound with greatest affinity to REs containing a DR-1 motif. We showed that TAK1 and PPARα are co-expressed in hepatocytes and that both receptors recognize several DR1s, including TAK1-RE and PPREs of the ACOX and HD genes. However, in contrast to PPARα, TAK1 was unable to induce PPRE-dependent transcriptional activation. Moreover, TAK1 inhibited the PPRE-dependent transcriptional activation mediated by PPARα·RXRα heterodimers. We demonstrated that this repression did not involve a mechanism by which TAK1 titrates out PPARα or RXRα from PPARα·RXR complexes but was due to competition of TAK1 with PPARα·RXRα for binding to PPREs and common co-activators, such as RIP140. These results suggest an important role for TAK1 in modulating PPARα-controlled gene expression in the liver. The expression vector pGEM3Z-TAK1 encoding hTAK1 has been described previously (14Hirose T. Apfel R. Pfahl M. Jetten A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA3-TAK1 was created by inserting the XbaI-KpnI fragment of pGEM3Z-TAK1 containing the full-length TAK1 into the expression vector pcDNA3.1His (Invitrogen). The pSG5 expression vectors encoding mRXRα and hPPARα were gifts from Drs. P. Chambon (Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France) and F. J. Gonzalez (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) (33Sher T. Yi H.-F. McBride O.W. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), respectively. The CAT reporter gene constructs (TAK1-RE)3-tk-CAT and HD-tk-CAT were generated by inserting three copies of consensus TAK1-RE (GGCAGAGGTCAAAGGTCAAACGT)3 or one copy of the rat enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HD) gene PPRE TGTAGGTA-ATAGTTCAATAGGTCAAAGGAGAGGTGG into the HindIII andBamHI sites of pBLCAT5 (62Boshart M. Klüppel M. Schmidt A. Schütz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst .). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid ACOX2-tk-CAT, which contains two copies of the rat peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) gene PPRE, was a gift from Dr. J. Lehmann (Glaxo Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC). The pSG5-VP16-TAK1 expression plasmid encoding a fusion protein consisting of the VP16 activation domain and the full-length coding region of hTAK1 was created as follows. First, pBSK-TAK1–2 was created by inserting the EclXI and BamHI fragment of pGEM3Z-TAK1 into the Bsp120I and BamHI sites of pBluescript II SK. pSG5-VP16-TAK1 was then obtained by inserting theKpnI-XhoI fragment of pBSK-TAK1–2 into the same sites of pSG5-VP16. The pSG5-VP16, pSG5-Gal4(DBD)-hPPARα, and pSG5-VP16-mRXRα plasmid were obtained from Dr. J. Lehmann (54Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol.

The pSG5-Gal4-TAK1 chimera expression construct encodes a fusion protein between Gal4-DBD and the ligand binding domain of TAK1 (amino acids 181–596). The expression vector pSG5-VP16-PPARα was generated by inserting a PPARα fragment encoding amino acids 167–468 into the pSG5-VP16 vector. Expression vectors encoding the VP16-mRIP140 and VP16-mSMRT were generated by inserting the 2-kilobase pairXhoI fragment from pACT-mRIP140 into the SalI site of the vector pVP16 (CLONTECH) or the 1.8-kilobase pair BglII fragment from pACT-mSMRT intoBamHI site of pVP16 vector, respectively. 2J. L. Staudinger, manuscript in preparation. The pG5CAT reporter plasmid containing four copies of the GAL4 upstream activating sequence was purchased from CLONTECH. TNT lysate system (Promega) was used to synthesize hTAK1, mRXRα, and hPPARα proteins from pcDNA3-TAK1, pSG5-mRXRα, and pSG5-hPPARα plasmids. Oligonucleotide probes for EMSA were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). EMSAs were carried out as described previously (63Yan Z.H. Medvedev A. Hirose T. Gotoh H. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10565-10572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Unprogrammed translations with TNT lysates were used as negative controls (not shown). Identification of the DNA binding sequences with the highest affinity for TAK1 was carried out as described previously (63Yan Z.H. Medvedev A. Hirose T. Gotoh H. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10565-10572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture of 70 base pairs of DNA fragments was synthesized by PCR using the degenerate oligomers 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCAGCTCGAGN12AGGTCAN12GTCGACAAGCTTCTAGAGCA as template and 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCAGCTCGAG and 5′-TGCTCTAGAAGCTTGTCGAC as forward and reverse primers, respectively. PCR amplification (Perkin-Elmer) was carried out using 20 pmol of oligomers, 100 pmol of32P-end-labeled forward primer and 100 pmol of reverse primer for three cycles under the following conditions: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for each cycle. The double-stranded mixed DNA fragments generated were purified and incubated with in vitro synthesized hTAK1, and complexes were analyzed by EMSA. A band corresponding to the TAK1-RE complexes was excised, and the DNA was eluted in TE buffer. Recovered DNA was amplified by PCR for 15 cycles and used for EMSA analysis with hTAK1 using the conditions described above. This procedure was repeated six times. In the seventh round, PCR products were cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen). Inserts from individual white colonies were amplified and used in EMSA. DNA that competed in EMSA was subjected to sequence analysis. The sequences of 30 independent clones were analyzed. COS-7, CV-1, or Chinese hamster ovary cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well 24 h prior to transfections in 6-well dishes containing RPMI, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, or F-12 medium, respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the expression vectors and the CAT/LUC reporter constructs indicated using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (63Yan Z.H. Medvedev A. Hirose T. Gotoh H. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10565-10572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The plasmid β-actin-LUC was used as an internal control of transfection efficiency. Cells were collected 24 h after transfection, and CAT level was determined by the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was assayed with a Luciferase kit (Promega) in a Lumat LB9501 Luminometer (Berthold). Generally, transfections involving PPARα were done in medium containing delipidized serum (Sigma). After transfection, cells were treated for 24 h with 1 μm 8(S)-HETE or the RXR-selective retinoid SR 11217. The RXR-selective retinoid was obtained from Dr. M. Dawson, SRI, Menlo Park, CA. Isolation and culture of rat hepatocytes was done as described previously (64Karam W.G. Ghanayem B.I. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 2077-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cultures were treated with 10 μm Wy-14643 or Me2SO (0.1%) for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated using TriReagent (Sigma) according to manufacturer's directions. RNA (25 μg) was separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel, blotted to Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized to32P-labeled probes for TAK1, PPARα, RIP-140, ACOX, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as described previously (65Adachi H. Dawson M.I. Jetten A.M. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1996; 4: 365-381Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed for 1–2 h at 68 °C using QuikHybTM reagent (Stratagene); blots were subsequently washed once with 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 30 min, and then with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. Autoradiography was performed using with Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −70 °C with double intensifying screens. Although previous studies showed that TAK1 can bind a variety of direct repeat response elements (DR1–5) (14Hirose T. Apfel R. Pfahl M. Jetten A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the precise requirements for optimal binding of TAK1 had not been determined. To identify the consensus sequence of the response elements that bind TAK1 with the greatest affinity, a DNA-binding site selection strategy was employed based on a combination of PCR and EMSA. A mixture of degenerate oligonucleotides consisting of the fixed core motif AGGTCA, flanked upstream and downstream by 12 random nucleotides, was used in the initial PCR and EMSA (Fig. 1 A). After six rounds of selection with in vitro synthesized TAK1 protein, a strong radiolabeled band consisting of TAK1-oligonucleotide complexes was observed by EMSA. The PCR products generated after the seventh selection were cloned into the TA vector and the sequences of 30 independent clones analyzed (Fig. 1 A). Sequence analysis showed that in 23 clones the consensus sequence was determined by the nucleotides upstream from the fixed AGGTCA core motif, whereas in 7 clones, it was determined by nucleotides downstream of AGGTCA. The consensus sequence was calculated from these two sets of flanking sequences (Fig. 1 B). This analysis demonstrated that DR1 is strongly preferred by TAK1 for high affinity binding. Both the upstream and downstream sequences yielded as consensus AGGTCA. The two bases of the 5′-flanking region of DR1 at positions −7 and −8 showed a slight preference for G and A, respectively. Adenosine was the preferred nucleotide spacing the two core motifs. Based on the sequence analysis detailed above, we synthesized the consensus TAK1 response element GGCAGAGGTCAAAGGTCAAACGT (named TAK1-RE) as well as a DR0, DR2, and DR3 with the same flanking sequences (Fig. 2 A) and analyzed their ability to compete with 32P-TAK1-RE for TAK1 binding in EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2 B, unlabeled TAK1-RE competed effectively with 32P-TAK1-RE for binding of TAK1. The DR0, DR2, and DR3 oligonucleotides exhibited reduced ability to compete with32P-TAK1-RE for TAK1 binding, supporting the conclusion that TAK1 binds most strongly to DR1 response elements. To analyze further the requirements for high affinity TAK1 binding, several mutations in the TAK1-RE sequence were made (Fig. 3 A), and the ability of these oligonucleotides to compete with 32P-TAK1-RE for TAK1 binding was examined by EMSA. The oligonucleotides M1 and M4, in which the 5′-flanking sequence was altered, did not compete as well as did TAK1-RE (Fig. 3 B). Mutation of the nucleotide between the two core motifs from A to C also slightly reduced the binding affinity of TAK1. These results indicated that although these nucleotides were preferred for optimal binding by TAK1, these positions are not critical for TAK1 binding. The nucleotide M3, which contains only one core motif, was a very weak competitor, suggesting that TAK1 has a very low affinity for REs containing a single core motif. To examine whether TAK1 could induce TAK1-RE-dependent transactivation, the TAK1 expression vector pcDNA3-TAK1 and the (TAK1-RE)3-tk-CAT reporter plasmid were transfected into COS-7 cells and 24 h later assayed for CAT enzyme levels. A consistent 2–3-fold increase in CAT expression was measured compared with cells transfected with (TAK1-RE)3-tk-CAT reporter DNA only, indicating that TAK1 was a weak inducer of TAK1-RE-dependent transactivation (Fig. 4). Similar levels of transactivation were observed when cells were grown in delipidized serum indicating that serum lipids did not influence transactivation mediated by TAK1.

Previous site-directed mutagenesis had identified three residues on the α-neurotoxin from Naja mossambica mossambica(Lys27, Arg33, and Lys47) and four residues on the mouse muscle nAChR α-subunit (Val188, Tyr190, Pro197, and Asp200) as contributing to binding. In this study, thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis was applied to these sets of residues to identify specific pairwise interactions. Amino acid variants of α-neurotoxin fromN. mossambica mossambica at position 33 and of the nAChR at position 188 showed strong energetic couplings of 2–3 kcal/mol at both binding sites. Consistently smaller yet significant linkages of 1.6–2.1 kcal/mol were also observed between variants at position 27 on the toxin and position 188 on the receptor. Additionally, toxin residue 27 coupled to the receptor residues 190, 197, and 200 at the αδ binding site with observed coupling energies of 1.5–1.9 kcal/mol. No linkages were found between toxin residue Lys47 and the receptor residues studied here. These results provide direct evidence that the two conserved cationic residues Arg33 and Lys27, located on loop II of the toxin structure, are binding in close proximity to the α-subunit region between residues 188–200. The toxin residue Arg33 is closer to Val188, where it is likely stabilized by adjacent negative or aromatic residues on the receptor structure. Lys27 is positioned closer to Tyr190, Pro197, and Asp200, where it is likely stabilized through electrostatic interaction with Asp200 and/or cation/π interactions with Tyr190. α-Neurotoxins are potent inhibitors of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), binding with high affinity to the two agonist sites located on the extracellular domain.

These polypeptides (∼7 kDa) are characterized by three large loops which extend from a rigid globular domain held together by 4 or 5 conserved disulfide bonds. Even though α-neurotoxin structures have been solved, little is known about the structure of the toxin-receptor complex, and interacting residues have not been identified. In previous work, we delineated residues involved in the binding interaction on both the α-neurotoxin, Naja mossambica mossambica (NmmI), and the mouse muscle nAChR interfaces (36Ackermann E.J. Taylor P Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Four residues located on the receptor α-subunit and three residues located on the toxin structure were found to contribute significantly to high affinity binding. Even though wild-type NmmI displays an equivalent affinity for the two binding sites on nAChR, we showed through mutational analysis that the energetic contribution of selected residues differed at the two sites. Several of the toxin and receptor mutations studied differentially affected binding at the αδ and αγ sites, resulting in two distinct binding affinities (36Ackermann E.J. Taylor P Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we have utilized double mutant cycles to explore whether any of these residues are involved in pairwise interactions at each binding site. Such information may not only lead to a better understanding of the structure of the toxin-receptor complex, but combined with the known structure of the toxin may eventually establish spatial constraints within the receptor architecture (37Ranganathan R.

Recombinant wild-type and mutant NmmI were expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, and the free toxins were purified as described (36Ackermann E.J. Taylor P Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because several of the mutant toxins produced rather low affinity complexes with mutant receptors, relatively large amounts of NmmI α-neurotoxins were required for this study. Typically, 0.5–1.5 mg of toxin could be purified to homogeneity from 1 liter of cells. All receptor mutants were made as described previously (20Sine S.M. Quiram P. Papanikolaou F. Kreienkamp H.-J.

After 16 h, the medium containing cDNA was replaced with fresh medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum), and expression was measured 3–4 days after transfection (20Sine S.M. Quiram P. Papanikolaou F. Kreienkamp H.-J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8808-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding assays were carried out on assembled pentameric nAChRs expressed on the surface of intact cells. The cells were harvested by gentle agitation in phosphate-buffered saline plus 5 mm EDTA, centrifuged briefly, and resuspended in high potassium Ringer's solution. The cells were divided into aliquots for binding measurements (assay volume 200 μl). Specified concentrations of NmmI were added to each tube containing receptor and allowed to bind for 5 h. NmmI dissociation constants were measured by competition against initial rates of125I-α-bungarotoxin binding using 10–20 nmconcentrations (41Sine S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A concentration of α-bungarotoxin considerably above itsK d (60 pm) was used. The assay relies on the fractional reduction of the initial rate of α-bungarotoxin binding in the presence and absence of NmmI. α-Bungarotoxin rates are less affected by the receptor mutations, and these reductions will not influence the determined NmmI K d as long as α-bungarotoxin dissociation is slow relative to the time frame of the initial rate assay. Data were analyzed using least squares fits to the Hill equation or to two sites of equal population but different affinities. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 mmcarbamylcholine, 300 μm dimethyld-tubocurarine, or 4 μm cobra α-toxin (Naja naja siamensus), depending on the particular receptor mutant. Binding assays conducted in the presence of α-conotoxin M1 were carried out in an identical manner. Concentrations of α-conotoxin M1 utilized for assays with the receptor mutations were as follows: wild type (300 nm), V188D (300 nm), V188K (300 nm), Y190T (1 μm), Y190F (300 nm), P197I (1 μm), and D200Q (1 μm) and were based on previously determinedK d values for α-conotoxin M1 (40Sugiyama N. Marchot P. Kawanishi C. Osaka H. Molles B. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Using erabutoxin b as a template (an α-neurotoxin of known crystal structure (33Low B.W. Preston H.S. Sato A. Rosen L.S. Searl J.E. Rudko A.D. Richardson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The final conformation of the α-carbon backbone was adjusted to account for the two unique prolines in erabutoxin b and the single proline in NmmI. The modeled structure was then relaxed by unrestrained steepest descent minimization of 5000 iterations with the program Discover (MSI, 1997). Of the three segments of linear sequence in the α-subunit, the region encompassing residues 180–200 appears to be the most critical for NmmI recognition. Substitutions at residues 188, 190, 197, and 200 resulted in substantial decreases in toxin binding affinity (36Ackermann E.J. Taylor P Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), indicating major roles of these residues in α-neurotoxin recognition. Determinants in this region include a conserved aromatic residue (Tyr190), two positions where neuronal and muscle receptors differ (Val188 and Pro197), and a negatively charged residue (Asp200). The mutations Y190F and Y190T both resulted in a loss of affinity of ∼2 kcal/mol at the αδ site and almost 4 kcal/mol at the αγ site (Table I), suggesting the importance of the aromatic hydroxyl group. Introducing a positive charge at position 188 (V188K) was also unfavorable and destabilized the toxin-receptor complex by 1.8 kcal/mol (at the αδ site) and 3.5 kcal/mol (at the αγ site), whereas introduction of a negative charge (V188D) at this position had either no effect or far less of an influence (−0.09 kcal/mol at the αδ site and 1.8 kcal/mol at the αγ site). The selective loss in binding affinity observed with the introduction of a positive charge but not a negative charge suggested destabilization resulted from coulombic repulsion of the highly cationic α-neurotoxin. Elimination of the negative charge at position 200 (D200Q) decreased binding by 66-fold (2.5 kcal/mol) selectively at the αγ site.Table IBinding and coupling energiesMutationsBinding energyCoupling energyK d 1-aDissociation constant (nm) from two-site analysis of binding curves with equal population of sites.

Five of these residues appear to play the predominant role in binding (Ser8, Gln10, Lys27, Arg33, Lys47) (Fig. 1). The binding site utilized for the NmmI toxin appears to be similar yet not identical to that defined for erabutoxin a (36Ackermann E.J. Taylor P Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whereas Gln10 in erabutoxin a and Glu10 in NmmI affect binding differently, similar to erabutoxin a, the three conserved positive residues are critical for the NmmI-mouse muscle nAChR high affinity interaction. Homology modeling of NmmI using the solved crystal structure of erabutoxin a as a template is shown in Fig. 1. Locations of each of the residues studied here are indicated. R33E is near the tip of loop II, whereas K27E is closer to the top and opposite side of loop II. K47A is located on an exposed surface of loop III. The mutations K27E and R33E resulted in large changes in binding affinities for the NmmI-nAChR interaction at both the αδ and αγ interfaces (Table I). A shift in binding affinity of over 4 orders of magnitude was observed with R33E at the αγ binding interface and nearly 3 orders at the αδ binding interface (Table I). The mutation K47A did not exhibit site selectivity for αγ and αδ sites. Double mutant cycle analyses were applied to the three α-neurotoxin variants (K27E, R33E, and K47A) and six α-subunit nAChR variants (V188D/K, Y190T/F, P197I, and D200Q) described in order to delineate potential pairwise interactions. This method is based on simple additivity or non-additivity of mutations. If two residues are interacting, then the sum of the free energy change of the single mutations will usually not equal the free energy change measured with both mutations (45Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 835-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 46Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol.

This is shown by Equation 1: ΔΔG(X,Y)=ΔΔG(X)+ΔΔG(Y)+ΔΔGINTEquation 1 where ΔΔG (X) represents the change in free energy caused by a mutation at site X on one interacting species relative to its wild type, ΔΔG (Y) represents the change in free energy caused by a mutation at siteY on the other species relative to its wild type, ΔΔG (X, Y) represents the change in free energy caused by both mutations when present together, and ΔΔG INT (coupling energy) is the measure of the interaction of the two components that are mutated. If the two residues are not linked or interacting, ΔΔG INT will equal 0, and if the two residues are interacting then the value of ΔΔG INT may be either positive or negative depending on whether the interaction between the mutated residues reduces or enhances affinity (47Wells J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). ΔΔG INT can also be described in terms of the equilibrium constants (39Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar): ΔΔGINT=RTln(Ω)Equation 2 where Ω=Kd(WT,WT)·Kd(Y,X)Kd(WT,X)·Kd(Y,WT).Equation 3 Dissociation constants and changes in free energy for each of the mutant pairs analyzed are shown in Table I. Fig. 2 (A andB), shows typical binding curves obtained with the α-subunit mutations Y190T and P197I, respectively, when assayed with each of the toxin mutations; the wild-type toxin/wild-type receptor curve is also shown for comparison. As seen in Table I and Fig. 2, many of the mutant pairs result in large reductions in the overall affinity of the toxin-receptor complex. The dissociation constant for the R33E/V188D pair at the αγ binding site was too large to measure precisely but corresponded to a K d of more than 0.5 mm. The R33E/P197I mutant pair resulted in a loss of affinity of 8.0 kcal/mol (αγ site) or a loss inK d of 6 orders of magnitude compared with the wild-type/wild-type interaction. Mutant pairs involving the toxin mutation K27E also resulted in large destabilizations ranging from 3.5 to 7.5 kcal/mol. As expected by the demonstration of site selectivity conferred by mutations on the α-neurotoxin or receptor when analyzed separately, all of the mutant pairs showed two distinct binding affinities presumably arising from the αδ and αγ sites. Analysis of the binding curves yielded Hill coefficients ranging from 0.3 to 0.8, indicating the presence of two classes of binding sites. When these curves were fit to a two-site analysis of equal population, differences in affinity between the two sites ranged from 9- to 85-fold. To confirm that these binding curves reflected disparate affinities at the αδ and αγ subunit interfaces and to ascertain which site possessed the high affinity binding, assays were carried out in the presence of α-conotoxin M1. α-Conotoxin M1 has a more than 10,000-fold selectivity for the αδ binding site over the αγ site on the wild-type mouse receptor (K d, αδ = 0.45 nm,K d, αγ = 20 μm) (22Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,27Kreienkamp H.-J. Sine S.M. Maeda R.K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Conotoxin M1 site selectivity is maintained with each of the receptor mutations studied here despite some changes in the absoluteK d values.2 Thus, when α-conotoxin M1 is included in the α-neurotoxin-receptor binding assays, it protects the αδ site nearly completely, with the residual α-neurotoxin binding observed only at the αγ site. Fig. 2 C shows binding curves of K27E/V188D assayed in the presence and absence of 300 nm α-conotoxin M1. In the absence of α-conotoxin M1 the curve gives a Hill coefficient of 0.6 with K d values of 57 nm and 1.8 μm. In the presence of α-conotoxin M1, the number of sites decreased by ∼50% and the resulting Hill coefficient increased to 0.9, consistent with residual α-neurotoxin binding to a single class of sites. Because α-conotoxin M1 will preferentially protect the αδ site, the observed K d of 1.3 μm reflects lower affinity binding of K27E at the αγ site. Accordingly, identical experiments were carried out with each of the toxin-receptor pairs presented in Table I. In all cases, higher affinity α-neurotoxin binding was found to correspond to the αδ site and lower affinity to the αγ site, as indicated in Table I. The coupling coefficient Ω and coupling energy ΔΔG INT for each toxin-receptor pair (at both the αδ and αγ binding sites) were determined using Equations 1 and 2 (Table I and Fig. 3). Two of the mutant pairs studied gave strong coupling energies above 2.0 kcal/mol and seven pairs gave coupling energies of 1.5 kcal/mol or above. Despite very large shifts in the overall affinities of the mutant pairs relative to that of the wild-type toxin-wild-type receptor complex, the majority of the pairs showed simple additivity of free energy within experimental error (coupling energies approaching 0, 0.1–0.5 kcal/mol). Most strikingly, all of the mutant pairs involving K47A gave values very close to ΔΔG INT = 0, indicating that the introduced receptor mutations and the toxin mutation K47A do not grossly alter the respective protein structures. A few mutant pairs gave values between 1.0 and 1.3 kcal/m"
https://openalex.org/W2072015510,"The Wilms tumor suppressor protein, WT1, is a transcription factor capable of activating or repressing transcription of various cellular genes. The mechanisms involved in regulating the transcriptional activities of WT1 are beginning to be unraveled. It appears that physical interactions of other cellular proteins (p53 and par-4) with WT1 can modulate the function of WT1. Here, we report the identification and cloning of a novel WT1-interacting protein termed Ciao 1, a member of the WD40 family of proteins. Ciao 1 specifically interacts with WT1 both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction alters the mobility of a WT1.DNA complex in gel shift assays, and results in a decrease in transcriptional activation mediated by WT1. Ciao 1 does not inhibit binding of WT1 to its consensus nucleotide sequence and does not affect the repression activity of WT1. Thus, Ciao 1 appears to specifically modulate the transactivation activity of WT1 and may function to regulate the physiological functions of WT1 in cell growth and differentiation."

Although cellular long chain fatty acyl levels are normally in the range 5–164 μm, these levels increase as much as 4-fold in pathological conditions (reviewed in Ref. 22Gossett R.E. Frolov A.A. Roths J.B. Behnke W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Lipids. 1996; 31: 895-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since the critical micellar concentration of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs is 30–60 μm and as much as 96–99% of long chain fatty acyl-CoA partitions to membranes, this suggests that high levels of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs may disrupt membrane function as well as cellular signaling/gene regulation (reviewed in Refs. 10Jolly C.A.

Lipids. 1996; 31: 895-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Because of these considerations, it is important to understand the mechanisms that regulate the distribution of intracellular free long chain fatty acyl-CoAs.

Acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) is a small (10 kDa), highly conserved cytosolic protein broadly distributed among all eukaryotic tissues studied, and elevated expression of ACBP has been observed in malignant tumors and transformed cells (reviewed in Refs. 22Gossett R.E.

The second aim was to examine the structural dynamics of native rat liver apo- and holo-ACBP, to characterize the properties of fluorescent fatty acyl-CoAs within the ACBP-binding site, and to examine ACBP conformational dynamics in response to ligand binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialscis- and trans-parinaroyl-CoAs were synthesized as described (9Hubbell T. Behnke W.D. Woodford J.K. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3327-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). cis- andtrans-parinaric acids were from Calbiochem. Coenzyme A (CoASH), acyl-coenzyme A synthase, ATP, p-terphenyl, and 1,4-bis[4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolyl]benzene, and saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs were from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better.MethodsACBP was isolated from rat liver as described previously (24Gossett R.E. Edmondson R.D. Jolly C.A. Cho T.H. Russell D.H. Knudsen J. Kier A.B.

Protein Sci. 1997; 4: 2411-2423Crossref Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). The Bradford assay overestimates ACBP concentration by 1.69-fold.Steady State Fluorescence SpectroscopySteady state fluorescence spectra were measured in a 1-cm quartz cuvette with a PC1 Photon Counting Spectrofluorimeter (ISS Instr., Champaign, IL). Sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C (±0.1 °C). Excitation and emission bandwidths were 4 and 8 nm. Sample absorbance at the excitation wavelengths was ≤0.05.Time-resolved Fluorescence SpectroscopyData AcquisitionAll measurements of lifetime, differential polarized phase (limiting anisotropy, rotational rate), hydrodynamic radius, and wobbling in a cone angle were performed as described earlier with a GREG 250 Subnanosecond Multifrequency Cross-correlation and Modulation fluorometer with KOALA automatic sample compartment (ISS Instruments, Champaign, IL) (27Frolov A.A.

Intrinsic ACBP aromatic amino acids were excited with an Innova-Sabre argon ion laser (Coherent Laser Group, Palo Alto, CA) with automatic wavelength selection at λ = 275.4, 300.2, 302.4, and 305.5 nm (power output 340, 630, 800 and 460 milliwatts, respectively). ACBP intrinsic fluorescence was observed through 313 BP10 and 341 BP15 interference filters (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT). The extrinsic fluorescent ligands, cis-and trans-parinaroyl-CoAs, were excited at 325 nm by a 424NB He-Cd laser (Liconix Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and emission was observed through a KV389 low fluorescent cut-off filter (Schott Glass Technologies, Duryea, PA). Sample absorbance at the excitation wavelengths was ≤0.05. All data were obtained in 25 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °C.Lifetime Data AnalysisLifetime data were analyzed by ISS-187 Software (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL) as a sum of exponentials shown in Equation 1. I(t)=Σαiexp(−t/τI)Equation 1 where I is fluorescence, τ I is lifetime, and Σα i = 1. Fractional intensity, f i, was f i = α i τ I /Σα i τ I . Mean lifetime was Σf i τ I . The minimized χ2parameter was the criterion for goodness of fit to the model with χ2 <3 acceptable (30Parasassi T. Conti F. Gratton E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5660-5664Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Anisotropy Decay Data AnalysisAnisotropy decay was modeled by a sum of exponentials as follows: r(t) =r(0)Σg i exp(−t/θ i ), where r(0) is anisotropy of a fluorophore in the absence of rotational diffusion, θ i is the rotational correlation time, and g i is fractional anisotropy. The “goodness” of fit to the applied model was determined as described above using ISS-187 Software (ISS Instruments, Champaign, IL). The equivalent hydrodynamic radius of the protein was calculated as shown in Equation 2. R=(3kTθ/4πη)1/3Equation 2 where η is solvent viscosity. The value of the same parameter can be estimated from the hydrated protein volume as shown in Equation3. R=[(3/4π)(M/N0)(V2+δ1V1)]1/3Equation 3 where M is molecular weight;N 0 is Avogadro's number; δ1 is fraction of hydration; V 1 is volume of bound water; V 2 is protein-specific partial volume. δ1 = 0.4 g H2O/g protein;V 2 = 0.72 cm−3g−1 for an average protein (31Cantor C.R.

Billheimer J.T. Wood W.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11919-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A 2-ml sample of 0.05 μm ACBP in phosphate buffer was titrated with small increments of fatty acyl-CoA (0.1–1.0 μl) dissolved in double-distilled water. The fatty acyl-CoA stock solution concentrations were 270–300 μm. Each sample and blank (without ACBP) were thoroughly mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 1–2 min to permit stable measurement of the fluorescence signal. All measurements were performed at 25 °C.RESULTSFluorescent Fatty Acyl-CoA Binding to Native Rat Liver ACBPThe binding affinity of native rat liver ACBP for fatty acyl-CoA was examined using a direct binding assay. This assay takes advantage of CoA derivatives of naturally occurring fluorescent parinaric acids and does not require separation of bound from free fatty acyl-CoA. As shown in Fig. 1, cis- andtrans-parinaroyl-CoA are both 18-carbon fatty acids with 4 conjugated double bonds near the methyl terminus of the fatty acyl chain. cis-Parinaroyl-CoA has a cis-double bond at position 9, the same as that of the 18-carbon oleoyl-CoA (Fig. 1). Consequently, the kinked shape of the cis-parinaroyl-CoA acyl chain is nearly superimposable on that of the oleoyl-CoA acyl chain. In contrast, trans-parinaroyl-CoA has a straight chain fatty acyl chain, just like that of the 18-carbon stearoyl-CoA acyl chain (Fig. 1). Consequently, the straight shape of thetrans-parinaroyl-CoA acyl chain is nearly superimposable on that of the stearoyl-CoA acyl chain. These properties makecis- and trans-parinaroyl-CoA excellent fluorescent structural analogues oleoyl- and stearoyl-CoA, respectively.Although cis- and trans-parinaroyl derivatives fluoresce poorly in aqueous solution, upon titration of ACBP withcis- or trans-parinaroyl-CoA the fluorescence intensity increased, consistent with the ligand becoming localized in a more hydrophobic environment, i.e. protein binding pocket (Fig. 2). No shifts of cis- ortrans-parinaroyl-CoA fluorescence emission maxima were detected upon titration of ACBP (data not shown). Therefore, the increase in fluorescence emission intensity of the parinaroyl-CoAs, measured at 420 nm after each addition of ligand to ACBP, was corrected for the background (no protein) and plotted as a function of total ligand concentration. This procedure yielded pure saturation curves for both cis- and trans-parinaroyl-CoA as shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. Maximal fluorescence intensities were determined by titrating a small amount of each parinaroyl-CoA with increasing ACBP. These data were then used to construct Scatchard plots (Fig. 2, A and B, insets) and obtain binding parameters, dissociation constant (K d ), and molar stoichiometry (B max). Native rat liver ACBP boundcis- and trans-parinaroyl-CoAs at a single binding site: cis-parinaroyl-CoA B max= 0.93 ± 0.04 mol/mol, trans-parinaroyl-CoAB max = 0.89 ± 0.01 mol/mol. The respective affinities were K d = 7.03 ± 0.95 and 4.4 ± 0.43 nm. The binding affinity of ACBP for the straight chain trans-parinaroyl-CoA was significantly 1.5-fold higher than that for the kinked chain cis-parinaroyl-CoA. In summary, these data provide the first direct evidence that ACBP binds naturally occurring 18-carbon chain fatty acyl-CoAs with nanomolar affinity.Figure 2Titration of ACBP with parinaroyl-CoAs.

Edmondson R.D. Jolly C.A. Cho T.H. Russell D.H. Knudsen J. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which may result in a heterogeneous fluorescence emission of ACBP. Indeed, upon excitation at 270 nm, the wavelength where both Tyr and Trp were excited, native rat liver apo-ACBP had a rather broad (bandwidth 65 nm) fluorescence emission spectrum with a maximum at 322 nm and a shoulder near 300 nm (Fig. 3). Shifting the excitation wavelength to 280 nm resulted in a 7-nm (bandwidth 72 nm) broadening of the emission spectrum, almost exclusively on its blue edge. However, there was no effect on the position of the emission maximum (λmax = 322 nm) (Fig. 3). Further shifting the excitation wavelength to 296 nm, the wavelength where Trp residues were preferentially selectively excited, the apo-ACBP emission maximum (λmax = 332 nm) underwent a dramatic (∼10 nm) bathochromic shift, and the emission spectrum was narrowed by almost 11 nm (bandwidth 61 nm), as compared with that of excitation at 280 nm (Fig. 3).Figure 3Fluorescence emission spectra of ACBP.Spectra were normalized and corrected for the emission monochromator. The numbers next to the curves indicate the excitation wavelengths. Spectra were obtained with 1 μm ACBP in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In summary, the fluorescence emission characteristics of apo-ACBP proved to be strongly dependent on excitation wavelength. The data showed that apo-ACBP fluorescence spectra had a distinct Tyr emission component as evidenced by an unusually short wavelength emission maxima (λmax = 322 nm) upon excitation at 270 and 280 nm, as well as by the appearance of a characteristic Tyr emission shoulder near 300 nm upon excitation at 270 nm. Concomitantly, the apo-ACBP Trp emission component was clearly identified by its emission maximum at 332 nm upon excitation at 296 nm. The fact that native rat liver apo-ACBP had rather broad emission spectra (bandwidth 60–70 nm), regardless of the excitation wavelength (270–296 nm), was also consistent with both Tyr(s) and Trp(s) being present in highly heterogenous loci within the ACBP protein. In the case of the apo-ACBP Trp residues, these loci were characterized as highly hydrophobic, as shown by the fluorescence emission maximum of 332 nm (excitation at 296 nm) (33Burstein E.A. Vedenkina N.S. Ivkova M.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar).Effect of Oleoyl-CoA Binding on Steady State Fluorescence Characteristics of Native Rat Liver ACBPThe effect of oleoyl-CoA binding on fluorescence emission characteristics of native rat liver ACBP aromatic amino acid residues was monitored by exciting the protein emission at two wavelengths, 270 and 296 nm. The excitation at 270 nm resulted in emission from both Tyr and Trp components, whereas the 296-nm excitation allowed observation primarily of ACBP Trp emission (see above). As shown in Fig. 4 A, upon excitation at 270 nm, the fluorescence emission of ACBP was progressively quenched (up to 2-fold) upon titration apo-ACBP with increasing amounts of non-fluorescent oleoyl-CoA to form holo-ACBP. The reduction in fluorescence intensity was accompanied by a gradual red shift of the ACBP emission maximum (Fig. 4 A). The latter shifted almost 8 nm (from 322 to 330 nm), when oleoyl-CoA was present in 10-fold molar excess over ACBP (Fig. 4 A). The disappearance of both the shoulder observed near 300 nm in the ACBP emission spectrum (Fig. 4 A) and the gradual spectral shift of the emission maximum to the position of the Trp emission maximum (λmax = 330 nm, see Figs. 3 and 4 A) were consistent with oleoyl-CoA predominantly quenching the Tyr fluorescence emission component of ACBP. This suggestion was further supported by results of experiments where the same titration was repeated with excitation at 296 nm where Trp, rather than Tyr, was selectively excited (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to titration with oleoyl-CoA and 270-nm excitation (Fig. 4 A), ACBP fluorescence emission and the position of its maximum (λmax = 332 nm) were not significantly changed by oleoyl-CoA binding (Fig. 4 B) when the ACBP was excited at 296 nm. Thus, ACBP Trp residues did not appear available for quenching induced by the bound oleoyl-CoA. In summary, the differential effects of oleoyl-CoA on ACBP Tyr and Trp fluorescence emission characteristics were consistent with the following: (i) ACBP Tyr, but not Trp, residue(s) being localized within the oleoyl-CoA binding pocket, and/or (ii) ligand-induced conformational changes in the ACBP tertiary structure. These possibilities were resolved in the following sections.Figure 4Fluorescence emission spectra of apo- and holo-ACBP. Fluorescence emission spectra of ACBP (1 μm) were determined with and without oleoyl-CoA fromtop to bottom: no, 0.69 μm, 1.38 μm, 5.52 μm, 9.66 μmoleoyl-CoA. A, excitation at 270 nm. B, excitation at 296 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Time-resolved FluorescenceFluorescence Lifetime of Apo- and Holo-ACBPTime-resolved fluorescence studies of apo- and holo-ACBP were performed to understand better the nature of ACBP emission as well as the processes occurring in the protein globule on the pico- to nanosecond time scale upon ligand binding. The fluorescence decay of apo-ACBP was biexponential in nature, consistent with the presence of several emitting centers in the protein. Upon exciting at 275 nm (both Tyr and Trp excitation) but measuring emission at 313 nm (i.e. preferential measurement of ACBP Tyr emission at the blue edge of ACBP emission spectrum, Fig. 3), the major lifetime component was τ1 = 0.76 ns (fraction 0.82), and the minor component was τ2 = 2.44 ns (Table I). This biexponential decay resulted in a mean lifetime of <τ> = 1.06 ns (Table I). Addition of 10 molar eq of oleoyl-CoA to form the holo-ACBP reduced both the long lifetime value, from 2.44 to 0.79 ns, and even more dramatically the short component from 0.76 to 0.18 ns, while increasing the fraction of the long lifetime component by almost 4-fold, from 0.18 to 0.68. The overall effect of oleoyl-CoA binding to ACBP was a reduction of the average lifetime by approximately 2-fold, from 1.06 to 0.59 ns (TableI).Table IFluorescence decay of ACBPExcitation/emissionSampleτ1τ2f1f2〈τ〉1-aAverage fluorescence lifetime 〈τ〉 was calculated as 〈τ〉 = Σf i τ i .nsns275/313ACBP2.44 ± 0.180.76 ± 0.080.18 ± 0.030.82 ± 0.031.06 ± 0.03ACBP/oleoyl-CoA0.79 ± 0.020.18 ± 0.000.68 ± 0.0010.32 ± 0.0010.59 ± 0.01275/341ACBP1.51 ± 0.110.53 ± 0.020.48 ± 0.030.52 ± 0.030.99 ± 0.03ACBP/oleoyl-CoA1.35 ± 0.060.37 ± 0.030.51 ± 0.020.49 ± 0.020.86 ± 0.04300/341ACBP1.15 ± 0.060.34 ± 0.0010.52 ± 0.0020.48 ± 0.0020.76 ± 0.02ACBP/oleoyl-CoA1.11 ± 0.030.24 ± 0.010.51 ± 0.010.49 ± 0.010.69 ± 0.011-a Average fluorescence lifetime 〈τ〉 was calculated as 〈τ〉 = Σf i τ i . Open table in a new tab When ACBP was excited at 275 nm (both Tyr and Trp excitation) but emission was observed at 341 nm (i.e. preferential measurement of ACBP Trp emission on the red edge of ACBP emission spectrum, Fig. 3), the biexponential decay displayed different characteristics as compared with conditions favoring excitation and emission of ACBP Tyr (e.g. 275/313 nm excitation/emission). The long lifetime component was τ1 = 1.51 ns (fraction 0.48), and the short component was τ2 = 0.53 ns (TableI). However, the average lifetime <τ> = 0.99 ns (Table I) upon preferential excitation/emission of Trp was essentially the same as that upon preferential excitation/emission of ACBP Tyr. In contrast to preferential Tyr excitation/emission of ACBP, addition of 10 molar eq of oleoyl-CoA exerted a much smaller effect on fluorescence decay of the ACBP Trp. The main alteration detected was an ∼30% reduction of the short lifetime component from 0.53 to 0.37 ns (Table I). The long lifetime component and its fraction, 1.35 ns and 0.51, respectively, remained almost unchanged (Table I). Consequently, the average lifetime appeared to decline only slightly but was not statistically significant from 0.99 to 0.86 ns (Table I).In contrast to excitation at 275 nm, excitation of ACBP at 300 nm (partial selective excitation of ACBP Trp) and measurement of fluorescence emission at 341 nm (partial selective ACBP Trp emission) minimized contributions from the ACBP Tyr component while maximizing contributions from the ACBP Trp component (Fig. 3). Under the ACBP Trp partial selective excitation/emission conditions, 300/341 nm, ACBP fluorescence decay exhibited long, τ1 = 1.15 ns, and short, τ2 = 0.34 ns, lifetime components with the respective fractions being 0.52 and 0.48 (Table I). The average lifetime was calculated to be <τ> = 0.76 ns (Table I). When 10 molar eq of oleoyl-CoA was added to the ACBP, no dramatic changes in the parameters of ACBP fluorescence decay were observed (Table I).In summary, similar to the steady state fluorescence characteristics (Fig. 3), the native rat liver ACBP fluorescence lifetime parameters also appeared to be wavelength dependent (Table I), reflecting the contributions of both Tyr and Trp to ACBP emission. The major alteration in ACBP fluorescence decay upon oleoyl-CoA binding to the protein, ∼2-fold reduction in the average lifetime, was observed under conditions preferentially monitoring ACBP Tyr (275/313 nm excitation/emission) (Table I). The fact that ACBP fluorescence intensity was also reduced by ∼2-fold after addition of 10 molar eq of oleoyl-CoA (Fig. 4 A) was consistent with the mechanism of ACBP fluorescence quenching by oleoyl-CoA being predominantly dynamic in nature.Anisotropy of Apo- and Holo ACBPTime-resolved fluorescence anisotropy was used to examine the rotational dynamics of native rat liver apo-ACBP Tyr. Upon excitation at 275 nm and measurement of fluorescence emission at 313 nm, ACBP exhibited monoexponential anisotropy decay kinetics with a rotational correlation time θ = 3.07 ns (Table II). This relatively long correlation time reflected overall protein motion and was consistent with that expected for protein (ACBP) with molecular mass near 10 kDa (31Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Bartlett A.C. Vapnek P.C. McCombs L.W. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1980: 554Google Scholar). The ACBP hydrodynamic radius calculated from the time-resolved anisotropy data was 15.1 Å (Table II). The fact that the measured residual (limiting) anisotropy of ACBP r = 0.156 (TableII) was much less than both the maximal Trp and Tyr anisotropies measured in a propylene glycol glass at −60 °C,r 0 = 0.315 (34Lakowicz J.R.

To achieve high expression in 293 human embryonic kidney cells and formation of homo-oligomers, we joined the extracellular domains of each chimera to the M1 junction of the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5HT-3) subunit. Measurements of CTx ImI binding to the chimeric receptors reveal three pairs of residues in equivalent positions of the primary sequence that confer high affinity of CTx ImI for α7/5HT-3 over α1/5HT-3 homo-oligomers. Two of these pairs, α7Trp55/α1Arg55 and α7Ser59/α1Gln59, are within one of the four loops that contribute to the traditional non-α subunit face of the muscle receptor binding site. The third pair, α7Thr77/α1Lys77, is not within previously described loops of either the α or non-α faces and may represent a new loop or an allosterically coupled loop. Exchanging these residues between α1 and α7subunits exchanges the affinities of the binding sites for CTx ImI, suggesting that the α7 and α1 subunits, despite sequence identity of only 38%, share similar protein scaffolds."

Previously, defects in the gene coding for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) were shown to result in defective cytokine production in mast cells, and thereby mice carrying btk mutations exhibited diminished anaphylactic reactions in response to IgE and antigen. In this study, we provide evidence that the transcription factors involved in the IL-2 gene expression in T cells are also required for maximal activation of the IL-2 gene in FcεRI-stimulated mast cells.

These receptor-bound protein-tyrosine kinases are activated and phosphorylate target proteins such as phospholipase C-γ. Activated phospholipase C-γ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites, and diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (9Nishizuka Y.

Btk is also implicated in signal transduction for several immune cell and cytokine receptors (15Kawakami Y. Yao L. Han W. Kawakami T. Immunol.

In contrast with Lyn and Syk, Btk and Emt (also known as Itk and Tsk) do not physically associate with FcεRI. However, these Tec family protein-tyrosine kinases are activated by FcεRI cross-linking (17Kawakami Y. Yao L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Kawakami T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5108-5113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kawakami Y. Yao L. Tashiro M. Gibson S. Mills G.B. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3556-3562PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Btk was shown to play an important role in the FcεRI signaling system. 2Hata, D., Kawakami, Y., Inagaki, N., Kitamura, T., Lantz, C., Khan, W. N., Maeda-Yamamoto, M., Miura, T., Han, W., Hartman, S. E., Yao, L., Nagai, H., Goldfeld, A. E., Alt, F. W., Galli, S. J., Witte, O. N., and Kawakami, T. (1998) J. Exp. Med. 187, 1–13. Thus, xid(with a substitution of Arg-28 in Btk with Cys) and btk nullmice exhibited diminished anaphylactic reactions. Correspondingly, FcεRI-induced cytokine production was severely impaired in mast cells derived from these mutant mice. Defects in the FcεRI-induced production of interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in the mutant cells were found in the transcription of these cytokine genes.2 FcεRI cross-linking induces activation of three major mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, i.e. ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 (20Fukamachi H.

Activities of MAP kinases are regulated through a unique set of protein kinases in a cascade, e.g.Raf-1 → MEK1/2 → ERK1/2 and MEKK1 → SEK1 (also known as MKK4, MEK4, or JNKK) → JNK1/2 (26Marshall C.J.

Phosphorylation targets of MAP kinases include transcription factors. Typically, JNK phosphorylates c-Jun, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor, at the critical serine residues (Ser-63 and Ser-73) in the activation domain of c-Jun (29Adler V. Franklin C.C.

More recently, similar phosphorylation and transcriptional activation by JNK were shown for other transcription factors such as ATF2 (34Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

Miura T. Bissonnette R. Hata D. Khan W.N. Kitamura T. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Hartman S.E. Yao L. Alt F.W. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of IL-2 and TNF-α genes has been extensively characterized in T cells. IL-2 promoter activity depends on the 300-base pair region upstream of the transcription initiation site (38Durand D.B. Bush M.R. Morgan J.G. Weiss A. Crabtree G.R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Fujita T. Shibuya H. Ohashi T. Yamanishi K. Taniguchi T.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Several cis-acting elements that are binding sites for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), CD28RC, AP-1, and Oct have been identified (41Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belageje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,42Fraser J.D. Straus D. Weiss A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 357-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cooperation of these transcription factors is required for maximal activation of the IL-2 promoter. NF-AT, a family of related proteins, exists in the cytoplasm before activation and translocates to the nucleus in response to an increase in intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ (43Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). This translocation depends on dephosphorylation of NF-AT by a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, which is a major target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506. Translocated NF-AT forms a complex with a ubiquitous nuclear factor AP-1 to exert its transcriptional action (reviewed in Ref. 44Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). NF-κB is composed of Rel family members of p50 and p65 (reviewed in Ref. 45Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5588) Google Scholar). p50/p65 heterodimers seem to stimulate the transcription of the IL-2 gene, while p50/p50 homodimers inhibit IL-2 gene transcription (46Kang S.M. Tran A.C. Grilli M. Lenardo M.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1452-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The IL-2 promoter region contains two conventional and two noncanonical AP-1 binding sites. The latter AP-1 sites exist in a close apposition to the distal NF-AT and proximal Oct sites. AP-1 sites are bound by Jun/Fos or Jun/Jun dimers. The binding activity for the proximal Oct (Octp) site is constitutive, although the Octp site-dependent transcription requires T cell stimulation (40Serfling E. Barthelmas R. Pfeuffer I. Schenk B. Zarius S. Swoboda R. Mercurio F. Karin M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Similar to the IL-2 gene, transcriptional activation of the TNF-α gene induced by T cell receptor stimulation involves NF-ATp and ATF-2/Jun heterodimer proteins bound to the κ3 site and a cyclic AMP response element, respectively, in the 200-base pair TNF-α promoter (47Goldfeld A.E.

In this study, we determined which cis-regulatory elements in the IL-2 gene promoter are involved in FcεRI-induced activation of the IL-2 gene. Among the transcription factors involved in activation of the IL-2 gene, c-Jun and other JNK-activable transcription factors are shown to be regulated by Btk. Since Btk regulates JNK activity, we investigated the possible involvement of the MEKK1 → SEK1 → JNK pathway in the IL-2 gene activation in mast cells. B6/129 F2 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. btk null mice (50Khan W.N. Alt F.W. Gerstein R.M. Malynn B.A. Larsson I. Rathbun G. Davidson L. Mueller S. Kantor A.B. Herzenberg L.A.

Anti-phospho-c-Jun(Ser-63) and anti-c-Jun antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs, and anti-EE antibody was a kind gift of Dr. Arpad Molnar. Bone marrow cells from femurs of B6/129 F2 (wild-type (WT)) and btk null mice with the same genetic background were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mmglutamine, and IL-3 (culture supernatants of mouse IL-3 gene transfected cells). For transient transfection experiments, mast cells (BMMC for bone marrow-derived mast cells) after 4 weeks of culture were used. At this point, more than 95% of the live cells are immature mast cells. The lack of Btk expression in btk null mice was routinely monitored by immunoblotting of spleen cell lysates with anti-Btk. WT and K430R btk cDNAs in expression vectors, pMX-puro (a retroviral vector) and pME18S, have been described (25Kawakami Y. Miura T. Bissonnette R. Hata D. Khan W.N. Kitamura T. Maeda-Yamamoto M.

Mast cells derived from btk null mice after 2 weeks of culture in IL-3 were incubated in the presence of rat stem cell factor as well as IL-3 for another 2 weeks to accelerate cell proliferation before retroviral infection. pMX-puro vectors containing no cDNAs, WT btk cDNA, or K430Rbtk cDNA were transduced into BOSC-23 packaging cells (64Pear W.S.

Culture supernatants were recovered 48 h after transfection. Virus titers (1–5 × 105 colony-forming units/ml) in the supernatants were measured by infecting NIH/3T3 cells and selecting in 1 μg/ml puromycin. Mast cells cultured in the presence of stem cell factor were infected with the retroviruses in the presence of 10 μg/ml polybrene. Forty-eight h after infection, selection in puromycin (1.5 μg/ml) was started to obtain sufficient numbers of drug-resistant cells. Drug was omitted from the culture 2 days before transient transfection. Successful transfection by WT btk cDNA was routinely confirmed by restored secretion of IL-2 and TNF-α from immunologically stimulated transfectants.2 BMMC or stably transfected mast cells (1–1.5 × 107 cells) prepared as described above were transfected with 5–10-μg reporter plasmids together with or without the indicated combinations of expression plasmids by electroporation at 400 V and 950 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II system. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were started to be sensitized overnight with anti-dinitrophenyl monoclonal IgE antibody. Forty-one h after transfection, cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with antigen, 30 ng/ml dinitrophenyl conjugates of human serum albumin for 7 h before cell harvest. Cells were lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100 in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8)/1 mm dithiothreitol. Luminescence of cleared lysates after the addition of ATP and luciferin solutions was measured using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40-containing lysis buffer (65Kawakami T Inagaki N. Takei M. Fukamachi H. Coggeshall K.M. Ishizaka K. Ishizaka T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3513-3519PubMed Google Scholar), and cleared lysates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroblotting. Blots were blocked and incubated consecutively with primary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or NEN Life Science Products). Fluorescent bands were visualized by exposure to ReflectionTM autoradiography films (NEN Life Science Products). We and others recently showed that rodent mast cells, including BMMC, secrete IL-2 in addition to numerous other cytokines upon FcεRI cross-linking (66Tashiro M. Kawakami Y. Abe R. Han W. Hata D. Sugie K. Yao L. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2382-2389PubMed Google Scholar, 67Chang E.-Y. Szallasi Z. Acs P. Raizada V. Wolfe P.C. Fewtrell C. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2624-2632PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene turned out to be a major mechanism for this phenomenon.2 In the murine IL-2 promoter region, severalcis-regulatory elements have been identified (41Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belageje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 42Fraser J.D. Straus D. Weiss A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 357-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is interesting to determine which element is important for IL-2 gene transcription in mast cells. To this end, expression of IL-2 promoter-luciferase constructs with mutations at eachcis-element was measured in transiently transfected BMMC derived from B6/129 F2 or CBA/J mice (Fig. 1). Mutations in the distal NF-AT (NF-ATd, positions −285 to −281), AP-1 next to the NF-ATd site (NF-ATd/AP-1, −277 to −274), distal Oct (Octd, −253 to −251), NF-κB (−206 to −202), CD28RE (−160 to −157), proximal AP-1 (AP-1p, −151 to −149), proximal NF-AT (NF-ATp, −137 to −133), AP-1 next to the proximal Oct site (AP-1/Octp, −86 to −83), or proximal Oct (Octp, −79 to −77) sites drastically reduced FcεRI-induced transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter, while the effect of mutations at the distal AP-1 site (positions −185 to −183) was relatively small ( 15 (B6/129 F2) or 23 (CBA/J) of the activity of the WT promoter). These results indicate that most of the known cis-regulatory elements are required for maximal activation of the IL-2 promoter in mast cells as well as in T cells. The most severe impairments in FcεRI-mediated IL-2 promoter activation were observed with the mutant promoters containing mutated NF-ATd, NF-ATd/AP-1, NF-ATp, or AP-1/Octp sites in BMMC from both mouse strains (Figs. 1, B and C), suggesting that these AP-1 and NF-AT elements are crucial for FcεRI-mediated IL-2 gene transcription in mast cells. These data are consistent with the accumulated observations on T cells that NF-AT family and AP-1 proteins play essential roles in the transcription of the IL-2 gene (44Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). We recently showed that FcεRI-induced transcriptional activation of the IL-2 as well as TNF-α genes is severely compromised in xid and btk null mast cells.2 To further confirm this observation, we measured transcriptional activities of the IL-2 promoter in btk null BMMC that were stably transfected with the empty vector, WT btk, or kinase-dead (K430R) btk cDNAs. Comparable expression of WT and K430R Btk in the transfectants was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A). Upon FcεRI cross-linking, the transcriptional activity was strongly induced in WT btk transfected cells compared with those in vector or kinase-dead btk transfected cells (Fig. 2 A). This result demonstrates that Btk regulates expression of the IL-2 gene and that the intact enzymatic activity of Btk is required for this activity. This Btk function could be ascribed to its effects on mast cell differentiation. However, this possibility is unlikely for two reasons. First, btk null BMMC is phenotypically indistinguishable from WT BMMC.2 Second, transient expression of WT Btk, but not vector or K430R Btk, in btk null BMMC restored the FcεRI-induced transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene (Fig. 2 B). In these experiments, cells were harvested for luciferase assays only 48 h after transfection. This short period of time would not be long enough for cells to differentiate. These data together with the results shown in Fig. 1raise the possibility that Btk regulates IL-2 gene transcription by regulating the transcription factors that target the critical AP-1 and/or NF-AT sites. Therefore, we examined the transcriptional activity of individual cis-elements of the IL-2 promoter in btk null BMMC. For these transient transfection experiments, we used the basic enhancerless SV40 promoter-luciferase fusion vectors containing multiple copies of either the NF-ATd/AP-1 or AP-1/Octp sequences. Robust transcriptional activation was seen of NF-ATd/AP-1-Luc and AP-1/Octp-Luc constructs before FcεRI stimulation of WT btk-transfected cells, and FcεRI cross-linking further enhanced their transcriptional activities (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, a similar luciferase construct containing eight copies of the NF-κB site exhibited a high basal transcriptional activity, but no further enhancement by FcεRI cross-linking was observed. Transcriptional activities of these reporter constructs were much smaller in vector or kinase-dead btk transfected cells. These data suggest that Btk-regulated IL-2 gene transcription is mediated by AP-1- and/or NF-AT-dependent mechanisms. Previous studies demonstrated that FcεRI cross-linking induces activation of all three major subfamilies of MAP kinases, i.e. ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 (20Fukamachi H. Takei M. Kawakami T. Int. Arch.

https://openalex.org/W2062577265,"Since its cloning and tentative identification as a chloride channel, the function of the pICln protein has been debated. Although there is no consensus regarding the specific function of pICln, it was suggested to play a role, directly or indirectly, in the function of a swelling-induced chloride conductance. Previously, the protein was shown to exist in several discrete protein complexes. To determine the function of the protein, we have begun the systematic identification of all proteins to which it binds. Here we show that four proteins firmly bind to pICln and identify the 72-kDa pICln-binding protein by affinity purification and peptide microsequencing. The interaction between this protein and pICln was verified several ways, including the extraction of several pICln clones from a cDNA library using the 72-kDa protein as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The protein is homologous to the yeast Skb1 protein. Skb1 interacts with Shk1, a homolog of the p21Cdc42/Rac-activated protein kinases (PAKs). The known involvement of PAKs in cytoskeletal rearrangement suggests that pICln may be linked to a system regulating cell morphology.

Expression of the pICln cDNA in Xenopus laevisoocytes was correlated with the appearance of a nucleotide-sensitive chloride current (I = current, Cl = chloride, n = nucleotide-sensitive) (1Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickman K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 2Buyse G. Voets T. Tytgat J. Degreef C. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Eggermont J.

Although pICln was tentatively identified as an integral component of the chloride channel (1Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickman K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), several observations were inconsistent with the channel hypothesis for pICln. First, pICln lacks predicted hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains and structural homology to known channel proteins (1Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickman K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Second, in mammalian cells and Xenopusoocytes, pICln was abundant and exhibited a predominantly cytoplasmic and nuclear localization, whereas a small fraction (<5%) was associated with the cytoskeleton (5Krapivinsky G.B. Ackerman M.J. Gordon E.A. Krapivinsky L.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). No pICln was detected in the plasma membrane. The chloride conductance associated with expression of pICln was similar to an endogenous Xenopus oocyte chloride current elicited by hypotonic challenge (6Ackerman M.J. Krapivinsky G.B. Gordon E. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.C. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1994; 44: S17-S24PubMed Google Scholar). An anti-pICln antibody specifically ablated the swelling-induced chloride current inXenopus oocytes (5Krapivinsky G.B. Ackerman M.J. Gordon E.A. Krapivinsky L.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), a finding supported by antisense experiments in mammalian cells (7Gschwentner M. Nagl U.O. Woll E. Schmarda A. Ritter M. Paulmichl M. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For the reasons stated above, we proposed that pICln was a cytosolic regulator of a swelling-induced chloride channel rather than a channel itself (5Krapivinsky G.B. Ackerman M.J. Gordon E.A. Krapivinsky L.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast, Paulmichl and co-workers (8Laich A. Gschwentner M. Krick W. Nagl U.O. Furst J. Hofer S. Susanna A. Schmarda A. Deetjen P. Burckhardt G. Paulmichl M. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) maintain that pICln is the swelling-induced chloride channel itself. Recently, data were presented suggesting that the chloride channel evoked by pICln expression has properties different from the swelling-induced chloride current, including a higher permeability to NO3−, stronger outward rectification, and voltage-dependent nucleotide block (3Voets T. Buyse G. Tytgat J. Droogmans G. Eggermont J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The molecular identification of the swelling-induced chloride channel has proven difficult, and several proteins including P-glycoprotein, pICln, ClC-2, and ClC-3 have been proposed to constitute this channel (9Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C755-C789Crossref Google Scholar, 10Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Although it seems unlikely that either pICln or P-glycoprotein are themselves chloride channels, both ClC-2 and ClC-3 are well established members of a family of chloride channel proteins. In contrast, pICln exhibits no significant homology to any known mammalian protein and contains no domains that suggest a specific function. Although work from several laboratories supports a link between pICln expression and activation of a chloride current, the nature of this link is not clear. Currently there are no data to suggest that pICln directly regulates a chloride channel. Indeed, pICln may act far upstream from any plasma membrane-associated event and participate in such diverse functions as transcriptional or translational regulation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, or any one of several signal transduction cascades. pICln was shown previously to exist in several discrete complexes with other cytosolic proteins (5Krapivinsky G.B. Ackerman M.J. Gordon E.A. Krapivinsky L.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the identification of proteins interacting with pICln might reveal functional connections to signaling pathways or known cellular mechanisms. Here we report the identification of one such pICln-interacting protein, a 72-kDa protein that appears to be the human homolog of Skb1. Skb1 is a yeast protein that interacts with Shk1, a homolog of the p21Cdc42/Rac-activated protein kinases (PAKs). 1The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21Cdc42/Rac-activated kinase; IBP, pICln-binding protein; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; EST, expressed sequence tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. Although the function of PAKs are only beginning to be understood, they appear to affect cell morphology through interactions with the cytoskeleton (11Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Rat pICln coding sequence was subcloned into the pGEX-2T plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-pICln fusion protein was expressed in BL-21 bacteria and purified over glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's protocols. GST-pICln was immobilized using ActiGel ALD (Sterogene) at 2 mg of protein/ml of gel. Bovine ventricular tissue was minced and homogenized by Polytron (setting 7) for 3 × 30 s in MB buffer (10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the supernatant (2.6 g of protein) was loaded onto a 2 × 25 cm DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and washed with MB containing 100 mm NaCl. pICln-containing complexes (as detected by Western blotting) were eluted with MB + 400 mmNaCl. The eluate was supplemented with Triton X-100 (1% final concentration) and rotated overnight with 100 μl of GST-pICln resin. After washing beads with MB, 400 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, bound proteins were solubilized in SDS loading buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride film, and visualized with Coomassie staining. The 72-kDa protein band was excised, digested with trypsin and cyanogen bromide, and microsequenced (Mayo Foundation). IBP72 coding sequence was subcloned into pGEX-2T, and the GST-IBP72 fusion protein was produced and purified as described above. The full-length IBP72 clone was subcloned into pCDNA 3.1(−) (Invitrogen) and translated in vitro using the TnT system (Promega). pICln deletions were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) subcloning of truncated versions of human pICln coding sequence into pCDNA3.1(+) or (−); all constructs were “tagged” with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). 10 μg of each construct was used for calcium phosphate transfection of 50–70% confluent HEK293 cells plated in 10-cm culture dishes. 48 h after transfection, proteins were in vivolabeled for 5–12 h using 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham). IBP72 coding sequence was subcloned into pBTM-116KN vector (18Hollenberg S. Sternglanz R. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) using restriction sites introduced by PCR. The resultant construct was verified by DNA sequencing and used as the bait for two-hybrid screening of a human heart Matchmaker library (CLONTECH) in the yeast strain L40 (18Hollenberg S. Sternglanz R. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Full-length, FLAG-tagged pICln coding sequence was cloned into pGAD424 (CLONTECH). Yeast his3 expression was assayed by growth on dropout plates lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine and supplemented with 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. β-Galactosidase activity was measured usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as substrate. The multi-tissue human Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed according to the manufacturer's specifications with a [32P]dCTP random-labeled fragment (Stratagene) consisting of the entire human IBP72 human coding sequence. Total cell lysate for immunoprecipitation was obtained as 100,000 ×g supernatant after cell lysis in buffered solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and 350 mm NaCl. Soluble proteins were isolated by Dounce homogenization followed by pelleting of microsomal fractions at 40,000 rpm in an SW-55 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was supplemented with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% and with NaCl to 350 mm. For immunoprecipitation, samples were precleaned with 40 μl of Protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. pICln was immunoprecipitated using the aFP antibody as described (5Krapivinsky G.B. Ackerman M.J. Gordon E.A. Krapivinsky L.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). GST-pICln (1 μg) was used for precipitation of in vitrotranslated IBP72. Precipitation of the deletion constructs and interacting proteins was achieved using Protein G-Sepharose and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak). The rabbit anti-IBP72 antibody was generated against the GST-IBP72 fusion protein and affinity-purified. pICln was immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) total cell lysates using a polyclonal antibody generated to a GST-pICln fusion protein. Several proteins consistently co-immunoprecipitated with pICln (pICln-binding proteins (IBP)) with electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to molecular masses of 72, 43, 29, and 17 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 1). Since the same set of associated proteins was co-immunoprecipitated from the water-soluble cell fraction, we concluded that the IBPs are not membrane-associated proteins. Their association with pICln was judged to be specific because the same set of proteins was co-immunoprecipitated with a different anti-pICln antibody (data not shown). IBP72 was purified by affinity to pICln. Cytosolic extracts from bovine heart were used as the source of IBP72 since initial experiments indicated that it was relatively abundant in this tissue. IBP72 was enriched significantly in eluates from the GST-pICln resin (Fig. 1,lane 2). Immobilized GST did not bind this protein, indicating that the 72 kDa protein interacted with GST-pICln specifically (Fig. 1, lane 3). The purified 72-kDa protein was digested with trypsin and cyanogen bromide, and five different peptides were sequenced. The peptide sequences obtained from the 72-kDa protein were used to screen the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base. Several overlapping clones were identified that predicted a single open reading frame (ORF) of 1911 base pairs and whose translation contained sequences identical with the 72-kDa protein-derived peptides. Subsequently, two EST clones containing an identical 2.4-kb insert were identified (GenBankTM accession numbers R13970 andAA099674) that spanned the ORF. Using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends with a human fetal brain library, an additional 60 bases of 5′-untranslated sequence were identified. The ORF predicts a protein of 637 amino acids with a molecular mass of 72.6 kDa (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with this prediction, in vitro translation of the cDNA yielded a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa (Fig. 2 B). Only two residues are not conserved between the bovine and human proteins within the sequence specified by the five fragments. A 2.4-kb transcript for IBP72 was identified in a wide range of human tissues including skeletal muscle, brain, heart, placenta, kidney, pancreas, lung, and liver (Fig. 2 C). Although the cloned 72-kDa protein has no significant homology with other cloned mammalian proteins and contains no consensus structural motifs, it does exhibit moderate homology to putative proteins encoded in theCaenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes, as well as significant homology to theskb1 gene product (12Gilbreth M. Yang P.R. Wang D. Frost J. Polverino A. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (52% homology; Fig. 2 A). Recently, a human cDNA identical with our IBP72 was cloned by homology to Skb1 and submitted to GenBankTM (accession number AF015913). The cloned 72-kDa protein appears to be IBP72 as indicated by several approaches. First, the in vitro translated protein exhibited specific binding to the GST-pICln fusion protein but not to GST alone (Fig. 3, left panel). Second, an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant 72-kDa protein recognized IBP72 co-immunoprecipitated with pICln (Fig. 3, right panel). Third, a LexA-IBP72 fusion protein specifically interacts with a GAL4 activation domain-ICln fusion protein in the yeast two-hybrid system (TableI). Moreover, when a human heart cDNA library was screened in the yeast two-hybrid system using the LexA-IBP72 fusion protein as bait, six independent ICln clones were obtained. These results argue strongly that our cloned protein is IBP72.Table IInteraction of IBP72 with pICln in the yeast two-hybrid systemActivation domain proteinDNA-binding domain proteinGrowth on aminotriazoleβ-Galactosidase activityGADLexA−0LexA-Lamin C−0LexA-IBP72−0GAD-pIClnLexA−0LexA-Lamin C−0LexA-IBP72+29 ± 3GAD-pICln-DN103LexA−0LexA-Lamin C−0LexA-IBP72+54 ± 7 Open table in a new tab To identify the domain(s) of pICln critical for interaction with IBP72, we generated several epitope-tagged (FLAG) human pICln deletion constructs and examined their ability to bind native IBP72. The full-length FLAG-pICln protein and endogenous pICln interacted with the same set of proteins in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (data not shown). All deletion constructs were expressed at levels equivalent to or higher than the full-length FLAG-pICln protein, as assessed by immunocytochemical analysis and immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins (data not shown). Based on this approach, we conclude that the extreme carboxyl terminus of human pICln, specifically the last 37 amino acids, is critical for interaction with IBP72 (Fig. 4). Consistent with this result, one of the pICln clones identified by yeast two-hybrid selection has the amino-terminal 103 residues deleted but retains full ability to interact with IBP72 (Table I). In an effort to identify the functional role of pICln, we are characterizing IBPs. Four major IBPs consistently co-purify with pICln in several tissues. We cloned the human cDNA for IBP72 based on microsequence data obtained from affinity-purified bovine IBP72. The interaction between the cloned human IBP72 and pICln was confirmed by several lines of evidence, including the extraction of pICln from a cDNA library using the full-length coding sequence for IBP72 as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. IBP72 is ubiquitously expressed and has no identified mammalian homologs or recognizable structural motifs that would suggest a specific function. Currently we are cloning the other IBPs and will use similar approaches to verify the specificity of their interaction with pICln. Although IBP72 has no known human homologs, sequence similarity suggests that IBP72 represents a human homolog of the Skb1 protein fromS. pombe (12Gilbreth M. Yang P.R. Wang D. Frost J. Polverino A. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Skb1 was identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen using the S. pombe protein kinase Shk1 as bait. The Shk1 kinase is linked to Ras- and Cdc42-dependent signaling cascades regulating cell viability, morphology, and mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated pheromone responses (13Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). S. pombelacking Skb1 are less elongated than wild-type yeast, emphasizing the role of this protein in the regulation of cell morphology. Shk1 is a homolog of the mammalian PAK, of which there are three cloned isoforms (14Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). PAK kinases are activated by GTP-bound forms of the small GTP-binding proteins Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 and have been implicated in control of cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell morphology (11Sells M.A. Knaus U.G.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). One consistent conclusion from previous studies of pICln function is that its overexpression induces, either directly or indirectly, the appearance of a chloride conductance (1Paulmichl M. Li Y.

Given the biochemical characteristics of pICln, we favor the hypothesis that pICln is not a channel itself but rather part of a pathway either closely or remotely connected to a chloride current, possibly through cytoskeletal rearrangement. Indeed, actin co-immunoprecipitated with pICln, and a fraction of pICln associated with insoluble cytoskeletal elements (5Krapivinsky G.B. Ackerman M.J. Gordon E.A. Krapivinsky L.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The protein identified in this report, IBP72, may provide a link between pICln and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Regulation of swelling-induced chloride channels is likely to involve cytoskeletal rearrangement (15Strange K. Jackson P.S.

Also, recent evidence links p21Rho-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization to a swelling-induced chloride conductance (17Tilly B.C. Edixhoven M.J. Tertoolen L. Morii N. Saitoh Y. Narumiya S.

In RBL-2H3 cells, fMLP utilizes a pertussis toxin (ptx)-sensitive G protein to activate PLC, whereas PAF utilizes a ptx-insensitive G protein.

Protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition by H-89 enhanced inositol phosphate formation stimulated by fMLP but not PAF. Furthermore, a membrane-permeable cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (cpt-cAMP) inhibited phosphoinositide hydrolysis and secretion stimulated by fMLP but not PAF.

Pretreatment of intact cells with cpt-cAMP and fMLP, but not PAF, resulted in an inhibition of subsequent PLCβ3phosphorylation by PKA in vitro. These data demonstrate that fMLP receptor, which couples to a ptx-sensitive G protein, activates both PLC and cAMP production. The resulting PKA activation phosphorylates PLCβ3 and appears to block the ability of Gβγ to activate PLC. Thus, both fMLP and PAF generate stimulatory signals for PLCβ3, but only fMLP produces a PKA-dependent inhibitory signal.

Many extracellular signaling molecules including neurotransmitters, hormones, and chemoattractants mediate their biological responses via the activation of G protein-coupled receptors through stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C (PLC), 1The abbreviations used: PLC, phospholipase C; fMLP, n-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe; PAF, platelet-activating factor; G protein, GTP-regulatory protein; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; cpt-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′:cyclic monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; ptx, pertussis toxin; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine. 1The abbreviations used: PLC, phospholipase C; fMLP, n-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe; PAF, platelet-activating factor; G protein, GTP-regulatory protein; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; cpt-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′:cyclic monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; ptx, pertussis toxin; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine. and ion channels (1Rens-Domiano S.

Continuous agonist stimulation leads to waning of the biological response by a process termed desensitization (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases as well as by second messenger-activated kinases, such as protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C, are important in receptor desensitization (2Dohlman H.G.

Biol. 1997; 157: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Additionally, chemoattractant responses are regulated at the level of PLC (4Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R.

Chemoattractants such as formyl peptides (e.g.,n-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)), the anaphylatoxin C5a, and interleukin-8 activate PLCβ by releasing βγ subunits (Gβγ) of a pertussis toxin (ptx)-sensitive G protein, likely Giα2 (5Polakis P.G.

The latter, Gαq, likely activates PLCβ by a different mechanism (7Verghese M.W. Charles L. Jakoi L. Dillon S.B. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4374-4380PubMed Google Scholar,8Amatruda III, T.T.

Using this model, it was found that a membrane permeable cAMP analog caused inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by fMLP but not PAF (4Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This difference could be potentially related to the distinct G protein usage of these receptors. The present study characterizes this observation and demonstrates that fMLP causes an increase in cAMP production both in neutrophils and transfected RBL cells and that the resulting PKA activation leads to inhibition of a biological response, secretion. In addition, the data show that PLCβ3 is a direct substrate for phosphorylation by PKA and that fMLP receptor-stimulated PLCβ3 phosphorylation by PKA provides a previously unrecognized mechanism for the counter regulation of cellular activation. [32P]Orthophosphate (8500–9120 Ci/mmol), myo-[2-3H(N)]inositol (24.4 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN. fMLP, PAF (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), and the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 were purchased from Calbiochem.

Cell culture, neutrophil purification, GTPase activity, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, secretion, and in vivo PLCβ3 phosphorylation were performed exactly as described by us previously (4Ali H.

HL-60 cells were differentiated with 1.3% dimethyl sulfoxide for 5–6 days.In vitro phosphorylation of PLCβ3 was performed essentially as described for PLCβ2 (15Liu M.Y. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106) were treated with various agents or buffer for 5 min in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) (400 μm), lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-PLCβ3 antibody. The immune complex was washed with a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 7.4), MgOAc (20 mm), ATP (20 μm) and resuspended in the same buffer (50 μl) supplemented with 2 μCi of [γ32P-ATP]. Phosphorylation was started via the addition of 1 μl of purified PKA. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold buffer, and the immune complex was washed three times. The proteins were resolved on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. For cAMP assay, cells (0.5–1.0 × 106/ml) were preincubated for 10 min with 400 μm IBMX and stimulated with fMLP, C5a, or PAF. The reactions were quenched, and cAMP measurements were carried out as described in the cAMP kit manual. RBL cells were preincubated with or without a membrane-permeable cAMP analog, cpt-cAMP (1 mm; 5 min) and dose responses of fMLP- and PAF-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and degranulation were determined. As shown in Fig. 1 A, cpt-cAMP caused a substantial inhibition of fMLP-stimulated generation of inositol phosphates. In contrast, PAF-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was inhibited by only ∼30% (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, cpt-cAMP substantially inhibited secretion stimulated by fMLP but had no effect on the response to PAF (Fig. 1, C and D). The half-maximal and maximal concentrations of cpt-cAMP for inhibition of fMLP-mediated responses were ∼0.1 mm and ∼1 mm, respectively (Fig. 1, E and F). Cpt-cAMP also caused a substantial inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by fMLP but not PAF (4Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test whether cAMP also inhibited responses to other chemoattractant receptors that activate PLC via a ptx-sensitive G protein, its effect on C5a-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in RBL cells was tested. In the absence of cpt-cAMP, stimulation with C5a (1 nm) resulted an increase of intracellular mobilization of 162 ± 5.6 nm (n = 4) over basal. In the presence of cpt-cAMP (1 mm, 5 min), this response was reduced to 27 ± 2.2 nm (83% inhibition). The ability of fMLP and PAF to produce cAMP was also determined. As shown in Fig. 2 A, fMLP caused a ∼2.5-fold increase in cAMP over basal, whereas PAF produced no response. Treatment of cells with ptx (100 ng/ml, overnight) resulted in a complete inhibition of fMLP-stimulated cAMP generation. To determine whether the cAMP increase caused by chemoattractants has a regulatory effect on their cellular responses, cells were preincubated with the PKA inhibitor H-89 and its effect on fMLP and PAF-stimulated generation of inositol phosphates were tested. H-89 pretreatment resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in fMLP-stimulated generation of inositol phosphates (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the response to PAF was enhanced only by ∼20% and this effect was lost in cells treated with ptx. It was determined whether the findings in transfected RBL cells occurred in human neutrophils and in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, fMLP caused a significant increase in cAMP generation in neutrophils and in dimethyl sulfoxide differentiated HL-60 cells. C5a also stimulated cAMP production in neutrophils (Fig. 3 A). PAF did not stimulate cAMP formation in either neutrophils or HL-60 cells. Cpt-cAMP caused a substantial inhibition of fMLP but not PAF-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in both cell types (Fig. 3 B). Cpt-cAMP also caused a substantial inhibition of C5a-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in neutrophils (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Generation of cAMP and effect of cpt-cAMP on fMLP-, C5a-, and PAF-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in human neutrophils and HL-60 cells.

Reactions were quenched after 5 min, and intracellular cAMP concentrations were determined. B, indo-1-loaded neutrophils and HL-60 cells were preincubated with cpt-cAMP (1 mm; 5 min) and then stimulated with fMLP (0.3 nm), C5a (0.3 nm), or PAF (0.3 nm), and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was determined.

Both fMLP and PAF stimulated GTPase activity in a dose-dependent manner in membranes from buffer or cpt-cAMP-treated cells showing that cpt-cAMP pretreatment had no effect on this PAF- or fMLP-stimulated response (data not shown). Using antibodies that specifically recognize different PLCβ isoforms, it was shown that of the known PLCβ isoforms only PLCβ3 is expressed in RBL cells (4Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To determine if other PLCβ isoforms are expressed in RBL cells at levels below the detection of antibodies, specific oligonucleotide primers for different PLCβ isoforms were used for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on RNA from RBL cells. Rat brain RNA was used as a control. PLCβ3 was the only PLCβ isoform detected in RBL cells (data not shown). fMLP and cpt-cAMP caused a dose-dependent phosphorylation of PLCβ3 (Fig. 4,A and B). To determine whether PLCβ3 was a substrate for PKA, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PLCβ3 antibody and the ability of purified catalytic subunit of PKA to phosphorylate PLCβ3 was tested in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 4 C, PLCβ3 phosphorylation by PKA was detected within 1 min and remained elevated for 15 min. In vitroPLCβ3 phosphorylation by PKA was blocked in immunoprecipitates prepared from cells treated with cpt-cAMP (Fig. 4 D). To determine whether fMLP-stimulated PLCβ3 phosphorylation was in part activated by PKA, whole cells were incubated with either fMLP or PAF, PLCβ3 was immunoprecipitated, and the ability of PKA to phosphorylate the enzyme was determined. Treatment of cells with fMLP but not PAF resulted in a substantial inhibition of PLCβ3 phosphorylation by PKA (Fig. 4 D). Chemotactic, microbiocidal, and cytotoxic effects of phagocytic leukocytes are stimulated by chemoattractants such as formylated peptides and PAF via the G protein-coupled receptor activation of PLC (16Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 412-439Google Scholar). The ability of fMLP to produce a transient increase in cAMP production in neutrophils is well documented (17Simchowitz L. Fischbein L.C. Spilberg I. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 1482-1491PubMed Google Scholar, 18Verghese M.W. Fox K. McPhail L.C. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dai Y.

Signalling. 1996; 8: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); however, the physiological effects of this phenomenon were not known. A recent study did demonstrate that a PKA inhibitor enhanced superoxide production stimulated by fMLP in human neutrophils (21Mitsuyama T. Takeshige K. Furuno T. Tanaka T. Hidaka K. Abe M. Hara N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 145: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of this effect was also unknown. It also remained to be determined whether PAF stimulated cAMP production in neutrophils and whether inhibition of PKA resulted in the regulation of PAF-mediated biological responses as well. The present work utilizing RBL cells stably expressing fMLP and PAF receptors demonstrated that fMLP, but not PAF, caused an increase in cAMP formation and that preincubation of cells with a membrane permeable cAMP analog resulted in inhibition of both phosphoinositide hydrolysis and exocytotic release of granules stimulated by fMLP. Furthermore, the PKA inhibitor H-89 enhanced fMLP-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. These data suggest that cAMP produced by fMLP provides a mechanism for counter regulation of an fMLP-stimulated biological response, secretion via the inhibition of PLC activation. This phenomenon appears to be specific for fMLP versus PAF, as the latter did not cause cAMP generation nor did exogenously added cAMP inhibit PAF-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis or secretion. This difference in the regulation of fMLP- and PAF-mediated responses in transfected RBL cells is likely to be physiologically relevant as similar differences in the generation of cAMP and the regulation of cellular functions by cAMP were observed in the present study in human neutrophils and neutrophil-like HL-60 cells. These differences in the functional regulation of chemoattractant receptors are likely a consequence of G protein usage as suggested by the distinct ptx sensitivity of fMLP versus PAF receptors, with the former being sensitive and the latter is at least partially resistant (8Amatruda III, T.T.

In the studies reported here, fMLP stimulated a 40–50% increase in cAMP over basal levels in neutrophils and HL-60 cells (Fig. 3 A). These data are consistent with previous findings from this and other laboratories (17Simchowitz L. Fischbein L.C. Spilberg I. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 1482-1491PubMed Google Scholar, 18Verghese M.W. Fox K. McPhail L.C. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dai Y.

Furthermore, the ability of a PKA inhibitor to enhance fMLP-stimulated superoxide generation in neutrophils (21Mitsuyama T. Takeshige K. Furuno T. Tanaka T. Hidaka K. Abe M. Hara N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 145: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) suggests that the small fMLP-stimulated cAMP increase is sufficient to counter regulate the response to fMLP. This contention is supported by the finding that phosphodiesterase inhibitors which cause ∼50% increase of cellular cAMP also result in a substantial inhibition of fMLP-stimulated superoxide release in neutrophils (22Schudt C.

Of the nine adenylyl cyclases identified, activation of types I and III are inhibited by all three forms of Gi proteins (24Choi E.J. Xia Z. Villacres E.C. Storm D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

In contrast, types II and IV are activated by Gsand Gβγ of ptx-sensitive G proteins in a synergistic manner (23Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In guinea pig neutrophils, fMLP greatly potentiates cAMP production stimulated by prostaglandin E1 receptor and this enhancement is totally inhibited by ptx (27Suzuki T. Hazeki O. Hazeki K. Ui M. Katada T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In HEK 293 cells, which endogenously expresses adenylyl cyclase type III, fMLP causes an inhibition of cAMP production (28Uhing R.J. Gettys T.W. Tomhave E. Snyderman R. Didsbury J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Tsu R.C. Lai H.W. Allen R.A. Wong Y.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect of fMLP likely results from the interaction of Giα with type III adenylyl cyclase. However, in the same cell line transiently expressing adenylyl cyclase type II, fMLP causes the stimulation of cAMP production and this response is inhibited by ptx (30Tsu R.C. Allen R.A. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 4: 835-841Google Scholar). This indicates that fMLP can either stimulate or inhibit cAMP formation depending on the subtype of adenylyl cyclase expressed. The observation that fMLP caused cAMP formation in RBL cells and that this response was completely inhibited by ptx suggest that Gβγ directly interacts with adenylyl cyclases types II or IV to stimulate cAMP production. This contention is supported by the finding that PAF, which utilizes a ptx insensitive mechanism to cause intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in RBL cells, HL-60 cells and neutrophils, did not cause cAMP production in any of these cell types (Figs. 2 A and 3 A). The demonstration that cAMP did not cause phosphorylation of fMLP receptor (11Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and had no effect on fMLP-stimulated GTPase activity indicates that its ability to block fMLP-stimulated inositol phosphate generation and secretion is not mediated at the level of the receptor or its coupling to G protein. Inhibition of membrane inositol phospholipid resynthesis and thus a reduction in the availability of substrate for PLC has been postulated as a mechanism by which cAMP inhibits fMLP-stimulated generation of inositol phosphates in human neutrophils (31Kato H. Ishitoya J. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This mechanism is unlikely because cAMP did not inhibit phosphoinositide hydrolysis stimulated by PAF in RBL cells, and it had no effect on PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization in human neutrophils and HL-60 cells. The selective inhibition of fMLP response by cAMP is therefore likely to be mediated via the modification of PLC. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (this study) and Western blotting with PLCβ isoform-specific antibodies (4Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) it was shown that PLCβ3 is the only known PLCβ isozyme expressed in RBL cells. Furthermore, both fMLP and cpt-cAMP caused phosphorylation of PLCβ3 in this cell line. In addition, purified catalytic subunit of PKA phosphorylated PLCβ3immunoprecipitated from an RBL cell lysate. The observation that preincubation of cells with cpt-cAMP blocked subsequent in vitro PLCβ3 phosphorylation by PKA suggests that PLCβ3 is a direct substrate for PKA. The ability of cpt-cAMP to inhibit fMLP-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis and secretion is likely mediated via the phosphorylation of PLCβ3 by PKA. Importantly, the finding that fMLP stimulated the formation of cAMP and that pretreatment of cells with fMLP resulted in a partial inhibition of PKA-stimulated PLCβ3 phosphorylation in vitro indicate that fMLP-stimulated PLCβ3 phosphorylation is mediated, at least in part, by PKA. The ability of the PKA inhibitor H-89 to enhance fMLP-stimulated inositol phosphates generation suggests that counter regulation of fMLP-stimulated biological responses is likely mediated via the PKA-induced phosphorylation of PLCβ3. This form of inhibition appears to be specific for fMLP versus PAF, which did not stimulate cAMP formation and did not block PLCβ3 phosphorylation by PKA in vitro. Furthermore, the PKA inhibitor H-89 had no effect on the ptx-insensitive component of PAF-mediated generation of inositol phosphates. The data presented herein revealed that fMLP activated both PLCβ3 and cAMP production via a ptx-sensitive pathway. Interestingly, PKA activated by this mechanism phosphorylated PLCβ3 and blocked the subsequent activation of PLC by fMLP. It is likely that fMLP activates PLCβ3 through the release of Gβγ (8Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PLCβ3 can be hypothesized to selectively block activation by Gβγ as opposed to Gαq, which is activated by PAF. This suggests a novel selective counter regulatory pathway for certain G protein-coupled receptors such as those for chemoattractants that activate a ptx-sensitive signaling pathway. Other receptors such as the α2-adrenergic, dopamine D2 and adenosine A1 receptors also activate both adenylyl cyclase and PLC (23Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Given that PLCβ3 is expressed abundantly in many cells and tissues such as platelets, leukocytes, brain, testes, and lung (32Park D. Jhon D.Y. Kriz R. Knopf J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16048-16055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Banno Y. Nakashima S. Ohzawa M. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14989-14994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of PLCβ3 by PKA may be a novel mechanism for the counter regulation of some but not other G protein-coupled receptors. Receptors that couple to Gs and cause an elevation of intracellular cAMP levels are known to inhibit PLC-mediated responses to other receptors that couple to ptx-sensitive G protein (15Liu M.Y. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The data herein suggest that the mechanism for this phenomenon may be through the phosphorylation of PLCβ3 by PKA at a site which blocks Gβγ-mediated activation. PLCβ other than PLCβ3 may also be regulated by PKA. For example, phosphorylation of PLCβ2 by PKA has been suggested as a mechanism by which cAMP inhibits fMLP-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in differentiated HL-60 cells (15Liu M.Y. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is, however, important to note that the neutrophil-like HL-60 cells express both PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 (4Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cAMP causes phosphorylation of PLCβ3 in the human monocyte-like U937 cells and the murine macrophage-like J774.1 cells (4Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The finding that fMLP-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization were not completely blocked in neutrophils isolated from mice deficient in PLCβ2suggests that both PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 are activated by fMLP (35Jiang H.P. Kuang Y.N. Wu Y.P. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7971-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Unlike PLCβ2, which is expressed only in certain cells of hematopoietic origin, PLCβ3 is expressed in many cell types and tissues (32Park D. Jhon D.Y. Kriz R. Knopf J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16048-16055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, cross-talk between the adenylyl cyclase and PLC pathways is likely to be mediated via the phosphorylation of PLCβ2, PLCβ3, or both depending on the cell type on which the receptors are expressed."

It bound to vitamin D receptor (VDR) but not retinoic acid Xα receptor (RXRα) in the human T cell line MT2 cells. VDR binding to this element was confirmed by the Southwestern assay combined with immunodepletion using anti-VDR monoclonal antibody, and this binding activity was repressed by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Such a repression was reversed by acid phosphatase treatment, suggesting that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 phosphorylates VDR to weaken its binding activity to nVDREhPTHrP. In electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we found anti-Ku antigen antibody specifically supershifted the MT2 nuclear proteinnVDREhPTHrP complex. The nVDREhPTHrP-bearing reporter plasmid produced vitamin D-dependent inhibition of the reporter activity in MT2 cells, which was markedly masked by the introduction of the Ku antigen expression vector in the antisense orientation. On the other hand, such a procedure did not perturb the vitamin D response element-mediated gene stimulation by vitamin D.

This situation led us to address one of the key points in hormonal biology, negative feedback mechanism. The levels of almost all the hormones synthesized at a specific organ are under rigid control to keep their levels within a very narrow range. One of the representative mechanisms is the so-called end product inhibition. In the cases of the nuclear hormone receptors, negative transcriptional regulation of several pituitary trophic peptide hormone genes by glucocorticoid or sex steroid hormones is a good example. Although individual nuclear hormone receptors might well be involved in such regulation, detailed unified molecular mechanisms such as the manner of dimerization are largely unknown, with a few exceptions (9Carr F.E.

In this case, an active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, can be considered an end product of parathyroid hormone (PTH) action, and this metabolite, in turn, inhibits the synthesis of PTH mRNA to keep the blood calcium level constant. Demay et al. (16Demay M.B. Kiernan M.S. DeLuca H.F. Kronenberg H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, there have been no reports confirming that the nVDRE is conserved among the genes whose expression is negatively regulated by vitamin D. We have found that the human PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) gene, which is assumed to be derived from an ancestoral gene in common with the PTH gene (26Suva L.J. Winslow G.A. Wettenhall R.E.H.

With these cells, the therapeutic potential of vitamin D to decrease the blood calcium level due to the inhibition of PTHrP synthesis was discussed. Unlike parathyroid cells, from which it is hard to establish cultured cell lines, MT2 cells are transfectable cultured cell lines.

In each case, 40 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and CAT assay was performed. Where indicated, average CAT activity was calculated after three separate transfections using 14C scintillation counting, and typical results are shown in the figures with a given CAT activity as 100 in each case. Details are shown in each figure. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Schreiber et al.(31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) from MT2 cells 40 h after maintaining the cells in the media as indicated. The synthetic oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. 104 cpm of the probe (109 cpm/μg) was incubated with 10 μg of the nuclear protein along with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in each reaction for 30 min at room temperature. Final KCl concentration was adjusted to 80 mm by the binding buffer containing no KCl (10Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.W.

The total reaction volume was 25 μl. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gels, dried, and visualized by autoradiography as described (12Yang-Yen H-F. Chambard J-C.

When anti-human VDR rat monoclonal antibody, 9A7 (BIOMOL Research Laboratory Inc.), or anti-human RXRα rabbit polyclonal antibody, D-20 (Santa Cruz Biotech. Inc.) was used, each of 1/20 and/or 1/4 dilution and the respective control IgGs (1 μl) supplied by manufacturers were included in the reaction for 15 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probes. We also used 1 μl of anti-Ku antigen human antiserum, which specifically recognizes the p70 subunit of Ku antigen (29Chung U. Igarashi T. Nishishita T. Iwanari H. Iwamatsu A. Suwa A. Mimori T.

To explore the effects of vitamin D metabolites on the protein-DNA interaction, cells were treated in the same manner as described in transfection method. Where indicated, 0.1 unit of potato acid phosphatase (Sigma) was directly included in the reaction mixture at 37 C° for the indicated period. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad assay kit. Thirty μg of the nuclear proteins obtained as described above was mixed with an equal volume of 2× denaturing buffer (5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 0.05% pyronin Y, and 200 mmdithiothreitol). After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, samples were loaded onto an 8% (or 10%) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Further details were described elsewhere (28Okazaki T. Chung U. Nishishita T. Ebisu S. Usuda S. Mishiro S. Xanthoudakis S. Igarashi T. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that we used a radiolabeled oligo(nVDREhPTHrP or VDREmop) in this study. Where indicated, we used MT2 nuclear proteins in which VDR was immunodepleted with the 9A7 shown above, according to the method reported previously (28Okazaki T. Chung U. Nishishita T. Ebisu S. Usuda S. Mishiro S. Xanthoudakis S. Igarashi T. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with 1 μg/ml of the 9A7 or 1:1000 diluted anti-Ku antigen human antiserum also shown above was performed by the enhanced chemiluminescence method as reported (28Okazaki T. Chung U. Nishishita T. Ebisu S. Usuda S. Mishiro S. Xanthoudakis S. Igarashi T. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the upstream region of the human PTHrP gene, we found a DNA sequence homologous to a nVDRE in the hPTH gene (16Demay M.B. Kiernan M.S. DeLuca H.F. Kronenberg H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8097-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In the anti-stranded sequence of this DNA in the hPTHrP gene, 11 out of 13 bases or 10 out of 11 bases were identical to the nVDRE of hPTH (Fig. 1). Both contained one copy of the DNA motif AG(G/A)TTCA. This motif mimics a core sequence (AG(G/A)TCA) for the binding of the specific set of the nuclear hormone receptor including VDR (2Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one VDRE found in the mouse osteopontin gene (VDREmop; Ref. 22Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prahl J. DeLuca H.F. Denhardt D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9995-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) consists of a direct repeat of the same motif with two (or three) spacers. Furthermore, 4 bases, CTAT, flanking this motif were common between the two. These findings suggest that both might mediate negative gene regulation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Falzon (18Falzon M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) recently reported that the rat PTHrP gene possessed two distinct DNA elements (nVDREs), both of which were responsible for negative gene regulation by vitamin D. We compared our nVDRE of hPTHrP with Falzon's nVDREs in the rat PTHrP gene (18Falzon M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and speculated that one of them might be equivalent to our nVDRE because of the similar location and overall sequence similarity (see “Discussion”). Furthermore, we also found a DNA sequence in the chicken TGFβ2 gene very homologous to nVDREs of both hPTH and hPTHrP. Intriguingly, expression of the chicken TGFβ2 gene was shown to be inhibited by vitamin D in mesangial cells (20Del Rio-Tsonis K. Tsonis P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 1, the sequences of other recently proposed nVDREs such as those in the chicken PTH (21Liu S.M. Koszewski N. Lupez M. Malliche H.H. Olivera A. Russel J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 206-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) gene and the rat PTHrP gene (19Kremer R. Sebag M. Champignu C. Meerovitch K. Hendy G.N. White J. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16310-16316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or positive VDRE in the human osteocalcin gene (23Ozono K. Liao J. Kerner S.A. Scott R.A. Pyke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 21881-21888Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) are considerably different from these three nVDREs. We synthesized oligonucleotides corresponding to nVDREhPTHrP and VDREmop and examined the interactions between each of these oligonucleotides and nuclear protein(s) from MT2 cells by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2, both of the oligonucleotides formed two protein-DNA complexes. Since each of the lower bands did not consistently appear, we focused on the upper bands in this study. Although the migrating positions of both complexes seemed similar in EMSA, the MT2 protein-nVDREhPTHrP complex was competed out only by a 10–50-fold molar excess of the nonradiolabeled nVDREhPTHrP. The same amount of VDREmop was ineffective as a competitor. Conversely, only a 10–50-fold molar excess of VDREmop, but not that of nVDREhPTHrP, was able to abolish the formation of MT2 protein-VDREmopcomplex. Nevertheless, a 200-fold molar excess of the reciprocal competitors in each EMSA similarly abolished the binding between MT2 nuclear proteins and each probe (not shown and see “Discussion”). These results indicate that the composition of the nuclear proteins is different, at least in part, between the two protein-DNA complexes. We next explored the possibility that VDR and RXRα, both of which were shown to be crucially involved in VDREmop-mediated gene regulation by vitamin D in a wide variety of cells (2 and 4) other than MT2 cells, were present in the two MT2 nuclear protein-DNA complexes shown here. As shown in Fig. 3, both antibodies supershifted or attenuated the binding between VDREmop and MT2 nuclear proteins. On the other hand, the formation of the complex between nVDREhPTHrP and MT2 nuclear proteins was hardly affected by the addition of anti-RXRα antibody. Although the 1/4-diluted anti-VDR antibody weakened this complex, it did not supershift the complex (lane 3) nor did its 1/20 dilution affected the formation of the complex (lane 2), which was in contrast to the case of VDREmop and MT2 nuclear proteins (lanes 4–6). Together, these results suggest that nVDREhPTHrP-MT2 protein complex contained VDR but not RXRα, and VDR might be included in this complex in a manner different from the authentic VDR-RXRα heterodimer formation. Indeed, MT2 cells are known to contain large amounts of VDR (27Inoue D. Matsumoto T. Ogata E. Ikeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16730-16736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether nVDREhPTHrP is necessary for negative gene regulation by vitamin D in MT2 cells (Fig. 4), we transfected the cells either with the parental TkCAT (28Okazaki T. Chung U. Nishishita T. Ebisu S. Usuda S. Mishiro S. Xanthoudakis S. Igarashi T. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with the same CAT plasmid bearing nVDREhPTHrP in the sense orientation. As shown in Fig. 4, 10−8m1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 selectively inhibited CAT activity driven by nVDREhPTHrP-TkCAT but not TkCAT. Furthermore, less active vitamin D metabolites were ineffective. Our next question was what is the effect of vitamin D on the binding between nVDREhPTHrP and MT2 proteins. As shown in EMSA (Fig. 5 A), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 weakened the binding between nVDREhPTHrP and MT2 nuclear proteins, although it strengthened the binding between VDREmop and these proteins in a dose-dependent manner. In the Southwestern assay, using a radiolabeled nVDREhPTHrP as a probe (Fig. 5 B), similar dose-dependent effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were observed on the band corresponding to about 50 kDa in size but not on the other bands. We then employed MT2 nuclear proteins in which VDR was immunodepleted with the 9A7 shown above in the Southwestern assay. As shown in Fig. 5 C, immunodepletion treatment clearly and selectively abolished the binding of this 50-kDa band but not higher molecular mass bands, strongly suggesting this 50-kDa band corresponded to the VDR itself. On the other hand, the radiolabeled VDREmop yielded only one band around 96 kDa in size, which was unaffected by the immunodepletion. We assume these higher molecular weight proteins are nonspecific DNA binding proteins. Immunoblotting with 9A7 revealed that treatments with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 did not affect the amounts of VDR protein (Fig. 5 D). Together, these results suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment weakens the binding between nVDREhPTHrP and VDR in MT2 cells, thereby exerting its inhibitory effect on the expression of nVDREhPTHrP-bearing gene(s) in these cells. In order to find a clue for a probable partner of VDR in the nVDREhPTHrP-MT2 protein complex, we reexamined the sequence of nVDREhPTHrP and noticed that it contained an octamer ATTTGCAT-like sequence following the core motif. This sequence, ATTTGGTT, is reminiscent of one of the negative calcium-responsive elements, oligo(A). We previously showed that the footprint in the oligo(A) HeLa nuclear protein was localized exactly in this position (15Okazaki T. Zajac J.D. Igarashi T. Ogata E. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21903-21910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrated that the nuclear protein specifically binding to oligo(A) contained Ku antigen (29Chung U. Igarashi T. Nishishita T. Iwanari H. Iwamatsu A. Suwa A. Mimori T. Hata K. Ebisu S. Ogata E. Fujita T. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8593-8598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Various roles of Ku antigen such as double strand break repair or DNA recombination by virtue of its ability to bind DNA ends nonspecifically have been reported (32Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 33Rathmel W.K. Chu G. Mol. Cell.

However, a recent report demonstrating that Ku antigen recognizes a specific internal DNA element in the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat to inhibit glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcriptional stimulation (35Griffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache J.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine whether Ku antigen is involved in nVDREhPTHrP-mediated gene inhibition by vitamin D. As shown in Fig. 6, inclusion of anti-Ku antigen antibody (29Chung U. Igarashi T. Nishishita T. Iwanari H. Iwamatsu A. Suwa A. Mimori T. Hata K. Ebisu S. Ogata E. Fujita T. Okazaki T. J. Biol.

Of note, this treatment seemed to strengthen the binding activity of the faster migrating band when we used nVDREhPTHrP as a probe. However, as noted earlier, because the migrating position of the faster migrating band overlaps that of the occasionally observed lower band (Fig. 2), we did not pursue this issue in this manuscript. To show the effect of Ku antigen on nVDREhPTHrP-mediated gene repression by vitamin D in vivo, we transiently introduced an expression vector encoding the p70 subunit of Ku antigen in its antisense orientation (29Chung U. Igarashi T. Nishishita T. Iwanari H. Iwamatsu A. Suwa A. Mimori T. Hata K. Ebisu S. Ogata E. Fujita T. Okazaki T. J. Biol.

Immunoblotting with anti-Ku antigen antiserum, which specifically recognizes the p70 subunit of Ku antigen (Fig. 7 A), revealed that this treatment inhibited the synthesis of the p70 subunit of Ku antigen by abo"
https://openalex.org/W2128045605,"The nucleolar proteins Gar1p and fibrillarin possess a typical nucleolar glycine/arginine-rich domain and belong to ribonucleoprotein particles. Both proteins are essential for yeast cell growth and are required for pre-rRNA processing. In addition, Gar1p is involved in pre-rRNA pseudouridylation, whereas fibrillarin is required for pre-rRNA methylation. Gar1p and fibrillarin are each associated with a different subset of the small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Gar1p is co-immunoprecipitated with the H/ACA family of snoRNAs, whereas fibrillarin is co-immunoprecipitated with the C/D family. However, attempts to demonstrate direct interactions between fibrillarin and snoRNAs have failed, and such interactions between Gar1p and the H/ACA snoRNAs had not yet been reported. Among the H/ACA snoRNAs associated with Gar1p, one can distinguish a large group of snoRNAs that are not essential in yeast and serve as guides for pseudouridine synthesis onto the pre-rRNA molecule. In contrast, the two snoRNAs snR10 and snR30 are required for normal cell growth and for pre-rRNA cleavage. We show here that Gar1p interacts in vitro directly and specifically with these two snoRNAs. Deletion analysis of Gar1p indicates that a major RNA binding element, which is extremely well conserved throughout evolution, lies in the middle of the protein. However, this domain alone binds poorly to the target RNAs and an accessory domain is required to restore efficient binding. The accessory domain can be either one of the glycine/arginine-rich domains or a second element of the core of the protein that is highly conserved between different species."
https://openalex.org/W2024655191,"CyP-40 cyclophilins are found in association with molecular chaperone Hsp90·steroid receptor complexes. The amino-terminal portion of these cyclophilins harbors the characteristic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain, whereas three copies of the tetratricopeptide (TPR) motif, a structure shown to be involved in protein-protein interactions, and a putative calmodulin-binding domain are located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. The TPR domains mediate binding to Hsp90, but a requirement for the PPIase domain has not been established. To address this, we have investigated the effects of mutations that alter the PPIase domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CyP-40 homolog, Cpr7. Because Cpr7 is required for rapid growth and full Hsp90 activity, a functional assessment of the PPIase domain could be performed in vivo. A mutation in the catalytic domain altering a conserved site predicted to be essential for isomerase activity did not compromise Cpr7 function. Furthermore, deletion of the entire PPIase domain did not significantly affect growth or Hsp90-mediated steroid receptor activity. These results indicate that the TPR-containing carboxyl terminus of Cpr7 is sufficient for fundamental Cpr7-dependent activity.

The best characterized Hsp90-dependent substrates are members of the steroid receptor family. Maturation of steroid receptor complexes involves a dynamic assembly pathway in which the receptor first enters into an intermediate complex containing Hsp90, Hsp70, p60 (Hop), and p48 (Hip) (13Smith D.F.

Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) and is later found in a mature complex containing Hsp90, low levels of Hsp70, p23, and one of three immunophilins (15Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The mature complex is required for the steroid receptor to achieve a conformation that enables it to bind and respond to hormone. Three immunophilins, FKBP51, FKBP52, and Cyp-40, have been identified as components of distinct steroid hormone receptor complexes. FKBP51 and FKBP52 belong to the FK506-binding protein family, whereas Cyp-40 is a cyclophilin (15Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 16Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In addition to binding to their respective immunosuppressive drugs (FK506 or cyclosporin A), most immunophilins tested thus far exhibit peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) 1The abbreviations used are: PPIase, peptidyl-prolyl isomerase; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ORF, open reading frame; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pairs. activity in vitro (17Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Because these proteins are found in Hsp90-steroid receptor complexes in organisms as diverse as mammals and yeast, it would seem likely that prolyl isomerization plays a role in governing the activity of the complex. In vitro experiments have shown that CyP-40 can act as a molecular chaperone by maintaining a substrate in a non-native folding-competent intermediate (18Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, isomerization does not appear to be required for this function because treatment with cyclosporin A, which inhibits isomerase activity of cyclophilins in vitro, did not have an effect in this assay (18Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Furthermore, biochemical experiments have suggested that the isomerase activity of immunophilins is not required for reconstitution of the glucocorticoid receptor in mature heterocomplexes (19Owens-Grillo J.K. Hoffmann K. Hutchison K.A. Yem A.W. Deibel Jr., M.R. Handschumacher R.E. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20479-20484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, the in vivo role of the PPIase activity of immunophilins in Hsp90-dependent events, if any, remains unknown. In addition to the PPIase domain, Hsp90-associated immunophilins harbor three units of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), a degenerate 34-amino acid motif involved in protein-protein interactions (20Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). FKBP52 and CyP-40 interact directly with Hsp90 through this domain (21Radanyi C. Chambraud B. Baulieu E.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11197-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,22Hoffmann K. Handschumacher R.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) by binding to what appears to be a single TPR-accepting pocket on Hsp90 (19Owens-Grillo J.K. Hoffmann K. Hutchison K.A. Yem A.W.

Two additional components of steroid receptor-Hsp90 complexes, PP5 (a protein phosphatase) and p60, also contain TPR motifs and bind to the same site on Hsp90 as do the immunophilins (24Owens-Grillo J.K.

Interestingly, overexpression of the TPR domain of PP5 results in a dominant negative effect that inhibits glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transactivation (26Chen M.S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B.

Some of the TPR proteins that interact with Hsp90 have been proposed to target Hsp90 substrates to their cellular destination (24Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H.

Two Saccharomyces cerevisiae CyP-40 homologs, Cpr6 and Cpr7, have been identified (27Chang H.-C.J. Lindquist S. J. Biol.

Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Disruption ofCPR7 confers a modest decrease in the rate of cell growth (28Duina A.A. Marsh J.A. Gaber R.F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 943-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), but this effect is severe when combined with mutations that either decrease the levels of Hsp90 or disrupt STI1, the gene encoding the yeast homolog of p60 (29Duina A.A. Chang J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). CPR7 is also required for full activity of two heterologous Hsp90 substrates, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the oncogenic tyrosine kinase p60v-src (29Duina A.A. Chang J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this report we test the requirement for the PPIase domain in Cpr7. We conclude that fundamental functions associated with Cpr7 do not depend on its role as a prolyl isomerase but instead require the TPR-containing carboxyl terminus. The standard genetic techniques and growth media used were those described in Sherman et al. (31Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Plasmid pJM99, a centromeric plasmid expressing Cpr7 from the native CPR7 promoter, was constructed as follows. Oligonucleotides Cpr7gn1 (5′-AAATCTAGAGTAGGTGGATCTAGTAACTTC-3′) and Cpr7gn4 (5′-AGTCTCGAGGACAGCGCAAATGCTACCTG-3′) were synthesized and used to amplify a region of the S. cerevisiae genome encompassing ∼1 kb upstream and ∼900 bp downstream of the CPR7 open reading frame (ORF) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified product was treated with the restriction endonucleases XbaI and XhoI and subcloned into similarly treated vector pRS316 (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Cpr7R64A protein was expressed from plasmid pAADB163, which was constructed as follows. PCR primers Cpr7gn1 and Cpr7gn2 (5′-ATCCCCGGGAACGACTGCATGAAAACCATTTCCCTTATAGCTCAGG-3′) were used to amplify a region of the S. cerevisiaegenome that encompasses a region approximately 1 kb upstream from the start codon of the CPR7 ORF to ∼200 bp into theCPR7 ORF. The amplified product was treated withXbaI and SmaI and subcloned into pRS316 digested with the same enzymes. A second DNA segment corresponding to a region from ∼200 bp into the CPR7 ORF to ∼900 bp downstream from the stop codon of the CPR7 ORF was amplified by PCR with primers Cpr7gn3 (5′-TGTCCCGGGTTTATGATCCAGGCAGGTGAC-3′) and Cpr7gn4. This PCR product was then digested with SmaI andXhoI and inserted into the same sites of pRS316, which already contained the XbaI/SmaI insert. The resulting plasmid expresses a mutant Cpr7 protein from the nativeCPR7 promoter with the following amino acid substitutions: R64A, K67P,and N68G. Plasmid pAADB158 expresses the Cpr7ΔPPIase mutant protein from the CPR7 native promoter. The first step in its construction was to amplify the promoter region of CPR7 by PCR using primers Cpr7gn1 and Cpr7gn5 (5′-ATTGGATCCGCGGTTGGATGTAGGTTGTTG-3′) and to subclone the PCR product into pRS316 using XbaI and BamHI. Next, primersBamHIT7#1 (5′-CCCCCCGGATCCGACTGTGGAGTGTGGGAAAAA-3′) and Cpr7gn4 were used to PCR amplify a DNA fragment encoding the carboxyl-terminal region of Cpr7 and containing ∼900 bp of the 3′-untranslated region of CPR7. This PCR product was then treated with BamHI and XhoI and subcloned into pRS316, which already contained the XbaI/BamHI fragment. Plasmid pAADB158 expresses a mutant form of Cpr7, Cpr7ΔPPIase, that contains a deletion of amino acids 2–200. Plasmid pAADB131 expresses the Cpr7ΔPPIase mutant protein from the GAL1 promoter and was created by inserting aBamHI/EcoRI fragment from pJM12 (29Duina A.A. Chang J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) into the yeast expression plasmid pYES2. The protein expressed from this plasmid encompasses the same region of Cpr7 as the protein encoded by pAADB158. The Cpr7ΔPPIase-overexpressing plasmid used in the GR experiments (pAADB175) was constructed as follows. pAADB158 was treated with XbaI, and the 5′ overhangs were filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Next, the plasmid was treated withXhoI, releasing a ∼2.5-kb fragment. This fragment was then subcloned into plasmid pRS426 (a multi-copy version of pRS316 (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), which was previously digested with SmaI andXhoI. The Cpr6-overexpressing plasmid (pJM90) used in the GR experiments was constructed as follows. PCR primers Cpr6xgst (5′-CCCCGGATCCATGACTAGACCTAAAACTTTT-3′) and Cpr6-3′xgpd (5′-AAAGAGCTCTTGGGCAGGACGACATCATG-3′) were used to amplify a region of the S. cerevisiae genome beginning at the translational start site and ending approximately 1 kb downstream of theCPR6 ORF. The amplified fragment was treated withBamHI and SacI and subcloned into vector p2UGpd (a version of pRS426 that contains the promoter from the GPDgene). Overexpression of Cpr6 from this plasmid was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Plasmids expressing the wild-type or mutant forms of Cpr7 were introduced into S. cerevisiae cells using the lithium acetate method (33Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). For detection of Cpr7 proteins, cells were grown in YNB liquid medium (0.16% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.76% KCl) containing all amino acids but lacking uracil and containing either 2% glucose or 2% galactose, as indicated. Cells were lysed as described (27Chang H.-C.J. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-94988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an approximately equal amount of total cell lysate was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through 10% acrylamide. Equal sample loading was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. Separated proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The Cpr7 proteins were probed on immunoblots using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a region of Cpr7 from amino acids 193 to 393. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Promega) were then allowed to bind the anti-Cpr7 antibodies. Antibody detection was performed using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's guidelines. Cells deleted forCPR7 were transformed with a GR expression plasmid, p2A/GRGZ, which also harbors the lacZ gene under the control of GR elements (10Nathan D. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing the wild-type or mutant cyclophilins were introduced into these cells, and the transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity as follows. Mid-logarithmic growing cells were grown to a density of ∼1.5 × 107cells/ml in plasmid-selective medium containing 2% glucose were treated with saturating amounts (20 μm) of deoxycortisone for 1 h at 25 °C. Cells were immediately harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.4 μg/ml aprotonin (Sigma), 0.4 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), and 2 mm 4-aminoethyl-benzensulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)). Cells were then lysed using acid-washed glass beads (B. Braun Biotech International) by vortexing at full speed for 30 s and placed on ice for 1 min (repeated for six cycles). β-Galactosidase activity was measured and normalized to total cellular protein essentially as described previously (34Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 48: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To begin our assessment of the role PPIase activity might play in the function of CyP-40 cyclophilins, we tested whether Cpr7 exhibits isomerase activity in vitro. Using a standard assay (35Siekierka J.J. Hung S.H. Poe M. Lin C.S. Sigal N.H. Nature. 1989; 341: 755-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), isomerase activity was detected with the related cyclophilin Cpr6 2A. A. Duina, J. A. Marsh, and R. F. Gaber, unpublished observation. (30Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 36Warth R. Briand P.-A. Picard D. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but not with Cpr7 (30Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).2 Similar observations have been reported for the bovine cyclophilin RanBP2, which showed only marginal isomerase activity in vitro (37Ferreira P.A. Hom J.T. Pak W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23179-23188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is possible that the isomerase activity of Cpr7 was missed because the peptide substrate used in the assay does not sufficiently mimic natural Cpr7 substrates. Alternatively, Cpr7 may have evolved to carry out functions that are independent of peptidyl-prolyl isomerization. To test whether PPIase activity is required for Cpr7 function in vivo, we first mutated the highly conserved arginine residue in the catalytic region (Arg64 in Cpr7) to alanine (Fig. 1) and tested for the ability of the mutant protein (Cpr7R64A) to complement acpr7Δ recipient. Enzymatic studies have shown that the analogous arginine in the human CyP-18 protein (Arg55) is essential for PPIase activity in vitro (38Zydowsky L.D. Etzkorn F.A. Chang H.Y. Ferguson S.B. Stolz L.A. Ho S.I. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1(9): 1092-1099Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and the equivalent substitution in the retina-specific bovine cyclophilin RanBP2 (R143A) resulted in a dramatic in vivo defect in the processing of opsin in cone photoreceptor cells (39Ferreira P.A. Nakayama T.A. Pak W.L. Travis G.H. Nature. 1996; 383: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Expression of Cpr7R64A from the native CPR7 promoter produced a mutant protein with the same size and abundance as wild-type Cpr7 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Western blot analysis of wild-type and mutant Cpr7 proteins. Approximately equal amounts of whole cell lysates from cells grown in either glucose or galactose (as indicated) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by Western blotting technique using Cpr7-specific antibodies. The mutant proteins are indicated byarrows. Lanes 1 and 2 show immunoblots of lysates derived from CPR7 cells and cpr7Δ cells, respectively. Lanes 3–5 show immunoblots of proteins extracted from cpr7Δ cells that carried plasmids expressing either Cpr7R64A (lane 3) or Cpr7ΔPPIase expressed from either the nativeCPR7 promoter (lane 4) or the GAL1promoter (lane 5). Note that when Cpr7ΔPPIaseis under control of the GAL1 promoter, the protein is only detectable when cells are grown in galactose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the ability of Cpr7R64A to rescue the growth defect of Cpr7-deficient cells. The modest slow growth phenotype ofcpr7Δ cells (28Duina A.A. Marsh J.A. Gaber R.F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 943-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) is greatly enhanced when combined with deletion of HSC82 (29Duina A.A. Chang J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the major source of Hsp90 protein at normal temperatures (40Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). 3Deletion of HSC82 does not itself affect the growth rate at normal temperatures because the level of Hsp90 expression from the HSP82 gene is sufficient for growth (40Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Expression of Cpr7R64A completely rescued the growth defects of both cpr7Δ cells2 andcpr7Δ hsc82Δ cells (Fig. 3). This result shows that the highly conserved arginine within the catalytic site of Cpr7 is not required for normal growth and suggested that PPIase activity is not involved in this Cpr7-dependent function. To rigorously test this possibility, a plasmid that expresses a mutant form of Cpr7 in which the entire PPIase domain is deleted was constructed and tested for Cpr7 functions (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis confirmed that constructs with this deletion produced a protein of the anticipated size (Fig. 2). Expression ofCPR7 ΔPPIase from its native promoter resulted in partial rescue of the slow growth phenotype of cpr7Δhsc82Δ cells (Fig. 3). Because Cpr7ΔPPIaseis not expressed at the same levels as wild-type Cpr7 with this construct (Fig. 2), we tested whether increasing expression of the truncated protein would confer more complete rescue of the growth defect of cpr7Δ hsc82Δ cells. Expression of Cpr7ΔPPIase from the galactose-inducible GAL1promoter resulted in abundant production of the truncated protein (Fig. 2) and conferred growth rates in cpr7Δ hsc82Δ cells that are indistinguishable from those of wild-type cells (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that the TPR-containing carboxyl terminus of Cpr7 is sufficient to mediate normal Cpr7-dependent growth. The molecular components of the chaperone machinery that associate with the GR are conserved between mammalian and yeast cells (27Chang H.-C.J. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-94988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, when GR is expressed in S. cerevisiae it exhibits hormone-dependent signal transduction activity, and this activity depends on Hsp90 (41Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that deletion of CPR7 results in 5-fold reduction in the activity of GR (29Duina A.A. Chang J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of the TPR-containing carboxyl terminus of Cpr7 is sufficient to mediate Cpr7-dependent GR function, we tested its ability to restore GR activity in cpr7Δ cells. Expression of a wild-type copy of CPR7 from plasmid pJM99 incpr7Δ cells produced slightly less GR activity compared with cells harboring a chromosomal copy ofCPR7. 2 Because Western blot analysis showed that the expression level of Cpr7 from this plasmid was essentially normal,2 the modest decrease in GR activity is likely due to plasmid loss from a small percentage of the cells carrying the Cpr7-expressing plasmid during the growth of the culture. Expression of Cpr7R64A in cpr7Δ cells resulted in GR activity comparable with that of cells expressing wild-type Cpr7 from a plasmid (Fig. 4). Furthermore, Cpr7ΔPPIase restored some GR activity (55%) when expressed from the native CPR7 promoter and produced even greater GR activity (81%) when it was overexpressed (Fig. 4). In contrast, overexpression of Cpr6, a highly related cyclophilin that also contains three TPR motifs, did not increase GR activity (Fig. 4), showing that the role played by the carboxyl half of Cpr7 in the regulation of GR is specific. Two homologs of the mammalian cyclophilin CyP-40 occur in S. cerevisiae, but only one, Cpr7, has been shown to have a functional role in Hsp90-associated activity (29Duina A.A. Chang J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus far, no phenotype has been associated with the deletion of CPR6(28Duina A.A. Marsh J.A. Gaber R.F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 943-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Duina A.A. Chang J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F.

Interestingly, in vitro assays have detected isomerase activity for Cpr62 (30Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 36Warth R. Briand P.-A. Picard D. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but not for Cpr72 (30Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The results described here strongly suggest that the in vivo functions thus far associated with the yeast Cyp-40 homolog Cpr7, namely the maintenance of rapid growth rates and GR activity, are not dependent on PPIase activity but are mediated by the TPR-containing carboxyl terminus. This is consistent with the observation that pharmacological inhibition of isomerase activity does not prevent reconstitution of salt-dissociated GR heterocomplexesin vitro (19Owens-Grillo J.K. Hoffmann K. Hutchison K.A. Yem A.W. Deibel Jr., M.R. Handschumacher R.E. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20479-20484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The TPR-containing domain is capable of mediating both physical (29Duina A.A. Chang J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and functional (data herein) interactions with Hsp90. What, then, is the functional role of the PPIase domain of Cpr7? The steady-state level of Cpr7ΔPPIase was less than that of wild-type Cpr7 using the same promoters and plasmids. Thus, it is possible that the PPIase domain was adventitiously acquired in evolution as a mechanism for stabilizing the TPR-containing domain. If so, it seems unlikely that this is the only purpose of the PPIase domain because it has been highly conserved. The Cyp-40 member of the cyclophilin family is found in steroid receptor complexes from yeast to mammals. Moreover, a critical amino acid (Arg64), which is required for PPIase activity in other cyclophilins, is not required to maintain normal expression levels of Cyp-40 in yeast. Yet it too has been conserved from yeast to mammals. If stabilization of the TPR domain was the sole function of the PPIase domain, greater sequence divergence would be expected over one billion years of evolution. We favor the possibility that the PPIase domain plays a role in Hsp90-mediated events, but a subtle one. Effects that are too subtle to detect in the types of assays we have employed here can nevertheless provide sufficient advantage for selection in evolution. For example, the PPIase domain might affect the rate at which other co-chaperones join or leave the Hsp90 complex, enhance the proper localization of the complex in the cell, or act on an unidentified substrate whose function is not relevant in our assays. Whether such functions might involve catalyzing the isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds is unclear. Although PPIase activity was not detected with Cpr7 in vitro, its activities might be restricted to particular substrates and therefore not be apparent in a standard in vitro peptide assay. Examples consistent with this scenario are presented by the bovine cyclophilin RanBP2 and the well characterized Drosophila cyclophilin homolog NinaA. RanBP2 exhibits only modest PPIase activity in vitro, but mutation of the site analogous to the R64A mutation in Cpr7 significantly decreased its function in vivo (39Ferreira P.A. Nakayama T.A. Pak W.L. Travis G.H. Nature. 1996; 383: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although to our knowledge NinaA has not been reported to possess PPIase activity in vitro, mutations in NinaA that map to amino acid residues known to be crucial for PPIase activity in mammalian cyclophilins conferred strong ninaA mutant phenotypes in vivo (42Ondek B. Hardy R.W. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Shieh B.-H. Zuker C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16460-16466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In any case, with respect to growth control and GR activity in yeast, it is clear that the TPR-containing domain of Cpr7 plays a much stronger role than the PPIase domain. TPR domains have been identified in a number of proteins involved in varied cellular functions, including cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, and steroid receptor regulation (15Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 20Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In addition to a well established role in protein-protein interactions, recent reports have hypothesized that the TPR domains present in Hsp90-associated immunophilins are involved in subcellular targeting (24Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). How might the carboxyl terminus of Cpr7 function in Hsp90-dependent events? As suggested by others (24Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the TPR domain of Cpr7 may indeed be involved in subcellular targeting of the Hsp90·steroid receptor complex. Alternatively, but not exclusively, we speculate that the TPR region of Cpr7 might cause a conformational change in Hsp90, enhancing its effectiveness in chaperoning steroid receptors and growth regulators into active or at least signal-responsive conformations."
https://openalex.org/W2060185753,"Thyroid hormone receptor (T3R) α-1 and its oncogenic derivative, the v-ERB A protein, are phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Although this phosphorylation appears to be necessary for the oncogenic properties of v-ERB A, the mechanism by which phosphorylation influences the functions of v-ERB A and of the normal T3R has not been established. The protein kinase A phosphorylation site in T3Rα-1 is within a domain that is known to contribute to the DNA recognition properties of these receptors. We therefore analyzed the effects of protein kinase A phosphorylation on DNA recognition by the normal T3Rα and by the v-ERB A oncoprotein. We report here that phosphorylation of these receptor derivatives does not significantly alter the overall affinity of receptor dimers for DNA. However, phosphorylation does notably alter DNA recognition by preventing, or greatly inhibiting, the ability of these receptors to bind to DNA as protein monomers. These studies suggest that the phosphorylation of T3Rα-1 and v-ERB A by protein kinase A may provide a means of altering promoter recognition through a post-translational modification."
https://openalex.org/W2089417780,"Secondary structures, DNA binding properties, and thermal denaturation behavior of six site-directed mutant homeodomains encoded by the vnd/NK-2 gene from Drosophila melanogaster are described. Three single site H52R, Y54M, and T56W mutations, two double site H52R/T56W and Y54M/T56W mutations, and one triple site H52R/Y54M/T56W mutation were investigated. These positions were chosen based on their variability across homeodomains displaying differences in secondary structure and DNA binding specificity. Multidimensional NMR, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and circular dichroism spectropolarimetry studies were carried out on recombinant 80-amino acid residue proteins containing the homeodomain. Position 56, but more importantly position 56 in combination with position 52, plays an important role in determining the length of the recognition helix. The H52R mutation alone does not affect the length of this helix but does increase the thermal stability. Introduction of site mutations at positions 52 and 56 in vnd/NK-2 does not modify their high affinity binding to the 18-base pair DNA fragment containing the vnd/NK-2 consensus binding sequence, CAAGTG. Site mutations involving position 54 (Y54M, Y54M/T56W, and H52R/Y54M/T56W) all show a decrease of 1 order of magnitude in their binding affinity.

Multidimensional NMR, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and circular dichroism spectropolarimetry studies were carried out on recombinant 80-amino acid residue proteins containing the homeodomain. Position 56, but more importantly position 56 in combination with position 52, plays an important role in determining the length of the recognition helix. The H52R mutation alone does not affect the length of this helix but does increase the thermal stability. Introduction of site mutations at positions 52 and 56 in vnd/NK-2 does not modify their high affinity binding to the 18-base pair DNA fragment containing the vnd/NK-2 consensus binding sequence, CAAGTG. Site mutations involving position 54 (Y54M, Y54M/T56W, and H52R/Y54M/T56W) all show a decrease of 1 order of magnitude in their binding affinity. The roles in structure and sequence specificity of individual atom-atom interactions are described. Homeodomain-containing proteins act as regulators of transcription by binding to various target DNA sequences and they specify positional information and segmental identity in the commitment of embryonic cells to specific developmental pathways (1Gehring W.J.

The detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the homeodomain regulates development is of considerable current interest (5Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzell G.W. Biochim. Biophys.

The ability of such a protein to target its DNA binding site and regulate gene expression is strongly dependent upon the specific amino acid residues in the homeodomain. Furthermore, there is a growing body of data relating mutations in the homeodomain to a wide variety of developmental abnormalities (12Heberlein U. Penton A. Falsafi S. Hackett D. Rubin G.M. Mech.

Some anomalies in development have been shown to result from single site amino acid residue replacements (17Frasch M. Warrior R. Tugwood J. Levine M.

A primary function of the homeodomain is to bind to a specific site or set of similar sites in DNA (20Hoey T. Levine M. Nature. 1988; 332: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 21Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A.

Knowledge of the role of individual amino acid residues in tertiary structure formation and sequence specific DNA binding thus can provide important clues toward the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the behavior of the homeodomain as a transcription regulator. Members of the homeodomain family show a high degree of homology in their tertiary structures (2Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). This high degree of structural homology arises from similarities such as hydrophobicity or charge state maintained by amino acid residues at unique positions in the homeodomain that make specific interresidual contacts, thereby yielding a stable low energy structure (24Laughon A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11357-11367Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The homeodomain contains three helical segments, with helix II and helix III forming the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif (25Qian Y.-Q. Billeter M. Otting G. Müller M. Gehring W.J. Wüthrich K. Cell. 1988; 59: 573-580Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Helix III, the recognition helix, binds in the major groove of the DNA, and the partially flexible N-terminal arm orients in the adjacent minor groove (26Billeter M. Qian Y.-Q. Otting G. Müller M.

The principal contacts with the bases of the DNA involve amino acid residues usually in positions 2 or 3 and 5 of the N-terminal arm as well as residues at positions 46, 47, 50, 51, and 54 of the recognition helix. These protein-DNA contacts represent the major interactions responsible for nucleotide sequence-specific binding. Of these amino acid residues that contact bases of the DNA, only residues at position 54 are found to vary significantly among the homeodomains (2Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 33Gruschus J.M. Tsao D.H.H. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5372-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Questions concerning the role of sequence specificity of the homeodomain-DNA interaction in the regulation of gene expression naturally arise (34Draganescu A. Levin J.R. Tullius T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35Damante G. Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Civitareale D. Guazzi S. Polycarpou-Schwartz M. Cauci S. Quadrifoglio F. Formisano S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4992-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Is there sufficient variability in the homeodomain to explain functional specificities in development? How do fine distinctions in properties of the homeodomain-DNA complex such as small variations in binding affinity or subtle differences in the three-dimensional structure correlate with target specificity in transcription regulation? The homeodomain of particular interest in this study comes from thevnd (ventral nervous system-defective)/NK-2 gene (14Jiménez F. Martin-Morris L.E. Velasco L. Chu H. Sierra J. Rosen D.R. White K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3487-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 37White K. Dev. Biol. 1980; 80: 332-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) of Drosophila melanogaster and is the parent member of the vnd/NK-2 class of homeodomains first described by Kim and Nirenberg (38Kim Y. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7716-7720Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 39Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The vnd/NK-2 gene is predominantly a neural gene regulator and gives rise to part of the central nervous system of the embryo (40Mellerick D. Nirenberg M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 41Nirenberg M. Nakayama K. Nakayama N. Kim Y. Mellerick D. Wang L.-H. Webber K. Lad R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 758: 224-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain has been reported previously (42Tsao D.H.H. Gruschus J.M. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15053-15060Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 43Tsao D.H.H. Gruschus J.M. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The full structural integrity of helix III of vnd/NK-2 is conserved only through residue 52 (i.e. 11 amino acid residues in length), in contrast to that for Antennapedia (44Billeter M. Qian Y.-Q. Otting G. Müller M. Gehring W.J. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) where helix III is maintained through residue 60 (i.e. 19 amino acid residues in length). The structural behavior of vnd/NK-2 residues in the C-terminal region beyond residue 53 is difficult to describe due to increased conformational flexibility (45Qian Y.-Q. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Resendez-Perez D. Müller M. Gehring W.J. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This variability in the secondary structure of the recognition helix has been suggested to be largely due to the nature of the amino acid residue in position 56 (45Qian Y.-Q. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Resendez-Perez D. Müller M. Gehring W.J. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The vnd/NK-2 homeodomain recognizes the unusual DNA consensus sequence 5′-CAAGTG-3′. 1L.-H. Wang and M. Nirenberg, manuscript in preparation. 1L.-H. Wang and M. Nirenberg, manuscript in preparation. The canonical DNA consensus sequence recognized by many homeodomains contains 5′-TAATGG-3′ in its core (2Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Both helix III (the recognition helix) and the N-terminal arm make direct contact with the DNA. It was shown recently that the interaction in the recognition helix of tyrosine at position 54 (Tyr54) with the DNA is the major determinant of this uncommon nucleotide binding specificity (33Gruschus J.M. Tsao D.H.H. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5372-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition to residues directly involved in base-specific interactions, amino acid side chains in positions that do not contact any DNA base nonetheless are believed to influence the interaction of the homeodomain with DNA and thus may be important functionally. For example, nonspecific electrostatic interactions between positively charged amino acid side chains and the negatively charged phosphate backbone influence binding affinity (2Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The recognition helix contains many conserved amino acid residues including those involved in base-specific contacts as well as ones with positively charged side chains, some of which make nonspecific electrostatic contacts with the DNA. Thus, any variability in this region of the homeodomain must be of particular significance. For example, residue 56, which is thought to be important in determining the length of the recognition helix in the unbound state, is highly variable, with threonine at this position in the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain. Questions concerning a possible role of residue 56 in DNA binding specificity, although it does not contact the DNA, have been raised (45Qian Y.-Q. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Resendez-Perez D. Müller M. Gehring W.J. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The amino acid residue found in position 52, which also is in the recognition helix and not in direct contact with the DNA, is usually arginine. In rare instances, such as in vnd/NK-2, histidine is found in this position. Recently, single site mutations in rough and eve, where arginine is replaced by histidine at position 52, were found to produce temperature-dependent developmental abnormalities in the resultant D. melanogasterembryos (12Heberlein U. Penton A. Falsafi S. Hackett D. Rubin G.M. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Frasch M. Warrior R. Tugwood J. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1824-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Structural and chemical information regarding the role of a particular residue can be obtained, in part, by mutational analysis, where given residues of a homeodomain of interest are replaced systematically. In this paper, we describe effects on structural, thermal denaturation and DNA recognition properties of the homeodomain when positions 52, 54, and 56 are mutated simultaneously, in pairs, or singly (46Weiler S. Tsao D.H.H. Gruschus J.M. Yu L. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A342Google Scholar). These positions, within the recognition helix, were chosen based upon their variability across the homeodomains. The wild type homeodomain is vnd/NK-2, and the positional mutations are H52R, Y54M, and T56W and are made to correspond to the amino acid residues found in the Antennapedia (Antp) homeodomain. The choice of mutations of these residues in vnd/NK-2 to ones found in Antp is based upon the differences observed in DNA specificities, thermal stabilities (TableI), and lengths of the respective recognition helices of Antp and homeodomains in the vnd/NK-2 class.Table IComparison of vnd/NK-2 and Antennapedia homeodomains Open table in a new tab Restriction sites for NdeI and BamHI sites were engineered, via polymerase chain reaction, into a DNA fragment containing the sequence encoding the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain. This NdeI–BamHI fragment served as a template for introducing mutations by polymerase chain reaction using overlapping oligonucleotides that contained the appropriate nucleotide substitutions (47Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 15: 7351-7367Crossref Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Wild type and six of the seven possible mutant vnd/NK-2 DNA fragments were cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pET-15b (Novagen) and sequenced to verify the mutations and check for polymerase chain reaction errors. Screening for a colony containing a DNA insert that would encode the H52R/Y54M mutation in the homeodomain was unsuccessful. The resulting constructs, transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) plys S, produced fusion proteins containing six histidine residues, the thrombin cleavage site, and the sequence encoding the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain. The proteins of interest are 80-amino acid residue fragments that encompasses the 60-residue homeodomain. Because of our choice here of the pET-15b plasmid, this 80-amino acid residue protein differs slightly at the N-terminal end over the 77-residue protein used in our previous studies (33Gruschus J.M. Tsao D.H.H. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5372-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 42Tsao D.H.H. Gruschus J.M. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A.

Biol. 1995; 251: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).1 Fusion proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Biotinylated thrombin was used to cleave the homeodomain from the fusion protein and then removed with streptavidin immobilized onto agarose. Polyhistidine fragments and uncleaved fusion proteins then were removed by passing the mixture over a nickel affinity column. 15N-Labeled H52R/T56W mutant protein was purified from bacteria grown in 15N-enriched Bioexpress media (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as described above. All protein preparations were determined to be homogeneous by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their molecular weights and purities were verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. Complementary oligonucleotides that contain the vnd/NK-2 DNA consensus binding site sequence were chemically synthesized. Both plus (5′-TGTGTCAAGTGGCTGTAG-3′) and minus (5′-CTACAGCCACTTGACACA-3′) strands were radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. An equimolar mixture of the two strands was heated to 90 °C for 5 min, and then the strands were allowed to anneal by slowly cooling the solution to 4 °C. A double-stranded DNA fragment, BS2–18, containing the Antennapedia consensus binding site also was prepared from synthetic oligonucleotides (plus strand, 5′-GAGAAAAAGCCATTAGAG-3′; minus strand, 5′-CTCTAATGGCTTTTTCTC-3′) using the method described above. Protein-DNA complexes were formed on ice for 30 min in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 90 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 10 pm labeled double-stranded DNA, and varying amounts of the homeodomain proteins. Reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 10% native polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 300 V in 0.5× TBE for 40 min at 4 °C. The gels were dried, and free and protein-bound DNA bands were visualized by autoradiography. Apparent K d values were obtained by quantitating the intensities of the bands and plotting the percentage of the total DNA that is bound to protein against the concentration of protein. Ellipticities in the far uv region (180/190–250 nm) were measured on a Jasco J600 spectropolarimeter using a 0.2-mm jacketed cuvette attached to a recirculating bath. Wild type and mutant protein samples (50 μm) were dissolved in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5). Spectra were recorded at discrete temperature intervals, allowing a 20-min equilibration time, and the data were averaged over eight scans. Values for mean residue ellipticity were calculated for all proteins at 222 nm and plotted against temperature. All NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Instruments AMX600 spectrometer. Samples were dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% D2O to final concentrations of 4 mm for the T56W and H52R/T56W mutants and 5 mmfor the H52R mutant. The pH values were adjusted to 4.5 by the addition of small amounts of HCl. Homonuclear two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy and NOESY 2The abbreviations used are: NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. experiments were carried out with mixing times of 100 ms. Mild presaturation was used for solvent suppression. For comparison purposes, spectra for the individual mutant proteins were collected at temperatures that corresponded to the analogous position in the order-disorder transition characteristic of each mutant as measured by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry (Fig. 2). The temperatures are, respectively, 12 °C for the T56W single mutant, 19 °C for the H52R single mutant, and 25 °C for the H52R/T56W double mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomains. For all three proteins, the upfield resonances in the range −1.4 to 0.6 ppm assigned to Leu16, Leu26, and Leu40 that are indicative of the formation of the hydrophobic core of the globally folded wild type vnd/NK-2 are present at these temperatures for the respective mutants. This comparison thus verifies the use of the temperature dependence of the 222-nm band in the CD spectra as an approximate and preliminary assessment of degree of folding. Spectra run at each temperature were calibrated using known values of the proton resonance of H2O. As an internal calibration check, the position of the α-CH3 resonance of methionine engineered at position −8 was verified to be at 2.13 ppm in all spectra. For the proton-deuterium exchange experiment, 15N-H52R/T56W vnd/NK-2 homeodomain was first dissolved in water, the pH was adjusted to 4.5, and then the concentration of the homeodomain was brought to 1.5 mm in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. A two-dimensional heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectrum was recorded at 12 °C. The sample was freeze-dried and then dissolved in D2O. Two-dimensional heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectra were recorded at 11 min, 58 min, 105 min, and 26 h after dissolving the homeodomain in D2O. For studies of the 15N-Y54M-DNA complex, a 16-mer double-stranded DNA (plus strand, 5′-TGTGTCAAGTGGCTGT-3′) was prepared as described previously (42Tsao D.H.H. Gruschus J.M. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15053-15060Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The 15N-Y54M-DNA complex was formed by titrating a 0.3 mm solution of15N-Y54M into a 0.3 mm solution of the DNA until a 1:0.95 molar ratio of DNA to protein was obtained. This solution was concentrated to give a final concentration of 1.5 mm of the complex, and the pH was adjusted to 6.0. The concentration dependence of the affinity of the purified wild type and six mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain proteins for the 18-base pair DNA duplex (containing 5′-CAAGTG-3′ as a central segment of the DNA) electrophoresed on a native polyacrylamide gel is shown in Fig. 1 A. This 18-base pair DNA fragment contains the same 16-base pair segment as the one used in our previous structural studies on the vnd/NK-2-DNA complex (33Gruschus J.M. Tsao D.H.H. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5372-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An AG duplex pair of bases is added to the 3′-end of the 16-base pair DNA fragment for optimal binding. The mobility shift data demonstrate high affinity binding of the wild type vnd/NK-2 homeodomain to DNA in the nanomolar range in accord with previous results (42Tsao D.H.H. Gruschus J.M. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15053-15060Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In a previous study of the three-dimensional structure of the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain-DNA complex, it was shown that Tyr54 is the only highly variable amino acid residue in the recognition helix found to make a base-specific contact with the DNA (33Gruschus J.M. Tsao D.H.H. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5372-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To assess the role of the interaction of Tyr54 with the DNA, the binding of the homeodomain with mutations involving position 54 was examined. The single Y54M mutant, the double Y54M/T56W mutant, and the triple H52R/Y54M/T56W mutant of vnd/NK-2 all show, within experimental error, a decrease of roughly 1 order of magnitude from 0.5–1.5 nmto about 7–14 nm (Fig. 1 A) in the binding affinity for the consensus DNA sequence. These ranges of binding affinities are the result of a minimum of four experiments carried out for each protein. To examine the roles of positions 52 and 56, DNA binding affinities for mutations involving these positions were determined. vnd/NK-2 is unusual in that it contains histidine in position 52. The amino acid residue in position 56 (threonine for vnd/NK-2) in the homeodomain has been implicated in determining the length of the recognition helix (42Tsao D.H.H. Gruschus J.M. Wang L.-H. Nirenberg M. Ferretti J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15053-15060Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,45Qian Y.-Q. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Resendez-Perez D. Müller M. Gehring W.J. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutations involving positions 52 and 56, namely the two single mutants H52R and T56W as well as the double mutant H52R/T56W, show no significant alteration of their binding affinity for the consensus DNA sequence from the nanomolar binding affinity found for the wild type vnd/NK-2 homeodomain under the mobility shift assay conditions (Fig. 1 A). At least three repeated assays were carried out for each of these latter binding constant determinations. For comparison, representative mobility shift data depicting the binding of the wild type and mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomains to an 18-base pair fragment of the recognition DNA site for Antp, BS2–18, are presented in Fig. 1 B. The triple H52R/Y54M/T56W mutation results in a homeodomain where the segment of the recognition helix from residues 46–57, which represents the part of the protein that resides in the major groove of the DNA, is identical to that of Antp. From the data in Fig. 1 B, it is seen that the wild type and mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain proteins including the triple mutant all bind the BS2–18 with similar 4–14 nm affinities, where this range in affinity arises from scatter in measurements taken from three and seven experiments for each individual protein studied. To evaluate the secondary structural behavior of the wild type and six mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomains, CD spectra were obtained in the 250–190-nm range. The mean residue ellipticities as a function of temperature at 222 nm are presented in Fig. 2. All of these proteins undergo reversible thermal denaturation within the temperature range of temperatures from −5 to about 50 °C, as evidenced by changes in helix content determined from the 222-nm band. The wild type homeodomain is the most thermally labile homeodomain characterized thus far (26Billeter M. Qian Y.-Q. Otting G. Müller M. Gehring W.J. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

In all examples studied, H52R site mutations result in increased thermal stability against denaturation as well as an increase in the cooperativity of the reversible denaturation transition. Furthermore, the H52R mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain shows an increase in the magnitude of the mean residue ellipticity in the folded state over that found for wild type, which presumably implies an increase in the conformational stability of the helical residues in the homeodomain. The denaturation temperatures at pH 4.5 change from approximately 25 °C for wild type to around 34 °C for the H52R/T56W and H52R/Y54M/T56W mutants. Introduction of the mutation involving position 56, i.e. T56W, only results in an increase in the cooperativity of the renaturation-denaturation transition as well as in the mean residue ellipticity"
https://openalex.org/W1985780751,"We have used inhibitors and site-directed mutants to investigate quinol binding to the cytochromeb nr (NarI) of Escherichia colinitrate reductase (NarGHI). Both stigmatellin and 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HOQNO) inhibit menadiol:nitrate oxidoreductase activity withI 50 values of 0.25 and 6 μm, respectively, and prevent the generation of a NarGHI-dependent proton electrochemical potential across the cytoplasmic membrane. These inhibitors have little effect on the rate of reduction of the two hemes of NarI (b Land b H), but have an inhibitory effect on the extent of nitrate-dependent heme reoxidation. No quinol-dependent heme b H reduction is detected in a mutant lacking heme b L(NarI-H66Y), whereas a slow but complete hemeb L reduction is detected in a mutant lacking heme b H (NarI-H56R). This is consistent with physiological quinol binding and oxidation occurring at a site (QP) associated with heme b L which is located toward the periplasmic side of NarI. Optical and EPR spectroscopies performed in the presence of stigmatellin or HOQNO provide further evidence that these inhibitors bind at a hemeb L-associated QP site. These results suggest a model for electron transfer through NarGHI that involves quinol binding and oxidation in the vicinity of hemeb L and electron transfer through hemeb H to the cytoplasmically localized membrane-extrinsic catalytic NarGH dimer.

This respiratory complex catalyzes quinol oxidation and proton release at the periplasmic side of the membrane and transfers electrons through various redox centers to the catalytic site where nitrate reduction and consumption of protons occurs (1Jones R.W. Lamont A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This leads to the generation of a proton electrochemical gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (1Jones R.W. Lamont A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NarGHI comprises a catalytic subunit (NarG) containing a non-covalently bound molybdenum cofactor (2DerVartanian D.V. Forget P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 379: 74-80Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), an electron transfer subunit (NarH) containing multiple [Fe-S] clusters (3Blasco F. Iobbi C. Giordano G. Chippaux M.

Boxer D.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). NarI (cytochrome b nr) is a diheme b-type cytochrome (6Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A.

Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Such a transmembrane topology is supported by recent studies of site-directed mutants of NarI that identified the histidine axial ligands of the two b-type hemes on helices II (His56 and His66) and V (His187 and His205) (7Magalon A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Rothery R.A. Frixon C. Weiner J.H. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25652-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In NarI, the low potential heme (heme b L,E m,7 = +10 mV) appears to be near the periplasmic surface of the membrane, whereas the high potential heme (heme b H, E m,7 = +120 mV) appears to be near the cytoplasmic surface. These positions relative to the membrane surfaces were predicted from the disposition of the coordinating histidines within the transmembrane helices and corroborated by EPR and optical studies of wild-type and site-directed NarI mutants (7Magalon A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Rothery R.A. Frixon C. Weiner J.H. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25652-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Such topological characteristics enable the NarI protein to interact directly with the membrane-embedded quinols and facilitate the transfer of electrons from the periplasmic to the cytoplasmic site of the membrane. To better understand the interaction of quinols with NarGHI, and more specifically with NarI, it is necessary to define functional domains and locate binding sites of inhibitors at key positions on the electron transfer pathway from quinol to nitrate. Specific inhibitors of cytochrome b-containing respiratory enzymes have been important tools for delineating the electron transfer mechanism of ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochromebc 1, complex III) (8Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 9Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 10von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the cytochrome b mutations of the bc 1complex that affect the inhibitor binding sites are all concentrated in four regions delineating the two quinol binding sites Qoand Qi located on the positive (outer) and negative (inner) sides, respectively, of the cytoplasmic membrane in prokaryotes or the inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes (11Brasseur G. Sami Saribas A. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The recently determined crystal structure of the bc 1 complex from bovine heart mitochondria clearly shows that both antimycin A and myxothiazol-binding sites partly overlap the quinone-binding site at the Qi site and the Qo site, respectively (12Xia D., YU, C.-A. Kim H. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HOQNO) is the most general inhibitor of the quinone-reacting cytochromesb, and its structure is reminiscent of physiological quinones. Such similarity suggests that its binding pocket may overlap quinone-interacting sites in the vicinity of theb-cytochromes. HOQNO has been shown to inhibit the quinol:nitrate oxidoreductase activity from various organisms (13Parsonage D. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 108-112Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Richardson D.J. Kelly D.K. Jackson J.B. Ferguson S.J. Alef K. Arch.

Biochem. 1986; 158: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), as well as nitrate-dependent proton extrusion into the periplasm (1Jones R.W. Lamont A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HOQNO does not inhibit the benzyl viologen:nitrate oxidoreductase activity (5Morpeth F.F. Boxer D.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that its binding site is associated with NarI (this subunit is not essential for benzyl viologen:nitrate oxidoreductase activity). Emerging structural data on NarI (7Magalon A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Rothery R.A. Frixon C. Weiner J.H. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25652-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) combined with information obtained from the effects of specific inhibitors would be of importance in delineating the electron transfer and proton release mechanism of NarGHI. Using optical and EPR spectroscopies of both wild-type and site-directed mutants of NarI, we report herein spectral shifts caused by several inhibitors of quinol oxidation. Our results suggest that physiological quinol oxidation occurs at a stigmatellin/HOQNO binding site (QP) which is located close to the low potential heme (heme b L), near the periplasmic side of the membrane.

For EPR studies, cells were grown microaerobically overnight at 30 °C. Cultures were harvested when the A 600 reached 1.0. Membrane vesicles were prepared by French pressure lysis in 100 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm EDTA and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm) (16Guigliarelli B. Magalon A. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4828-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Membranes were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70 °C until use. The benzyl viologen:nitrate oxidoreductase activities were assayed by a method modified from Jones and Garland (17Jones R.W. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 18Augier V. Guigliarelli B. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2013-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Menadiol:nitrate and duroquinol:nitrate oxidoreductase activities were measured as described by Guigliarelli et al. (16Guigliarelli B. Magalon A. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4828-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The I 50 values for inhibitors were defined as the concentration required to reduce the quinol-nitrate reductase activity by 50%. These values were deduced from the inhibitor titration curves of enzyme activity. Assays were performed as described (1Jones R.W. Lamont A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with a Jobin-Yvon spectrofluorometer model JY3D, using N2-saturated buffers. The reaction was initiated with 50 μm nitrate. Heme reduction and reoxidation were followed using a DW2A Chance AMINCO spectrophotometer. This instrument had a dual wavelength configuration, and heme reduction and reoxidation were followed using a wavelength of 560 nm with a reference wavelength of 575 nm. Reactions were observed at 25 °C in potassium phosphate buffer (K2HPO4/KH2PO4 50 mm, pH 7.5) with quinol analogs (menadiol or duroquinol) as electron donors (125 μm) and nitrate as electron acceptor (250 μm). Reaction conditions were as indicated in the individual figure legends. For these experiments, the DW2A spectrophotometer was used in a dual-beam configuration. Difference spectra were recorded of membranesplus inhibitor minus membranes without inhibitor. Inhibitors were added from stock solutions made with ethanol as solvent, and equivalent volumes of this solvent were added to cuvettes that did not have inhibitor added. Membrane vesicles were first reduced by adding a few grains of sodium dithionite, and the base line was recorded. Inhibitors or ethanol were then added to the cuvettes. Experiments were carried out using a 50 mm MOPS buffer at pH 7.0. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP300 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instrument ESR-900 flowing helium cryostat. Instrument conditions and temperatures were as described in the individual figure legends. Quinol:nitrate oxidoreductase activities, using menadiol as electron donor, were measured in the presence of various potent inhibitors of electron transfer in the mitochondrialbc 1 complex. It appears that of all the compounds tested, the most effective are HOQNO (I 50 = 6 μm) and stigmatellin (I 50 = 0.25 μm) whose structures are strongly reminiscent of quinones. DCMU and antimycin A are poor inhibitors and have measurable effects only at high concentrations (I 50 > 40 μm). Finally, myxothiazol, atrazin, funiculosin, UHDBT and DBMIB appeared to have no effect on the quinol:nitrate oxidoreductase activity. Fig. 1 shows the concentration dependence of the HOQNO and stigmatellin inhibition of menadiol:nitrate reductase activity. The major part of the quinol activity is inhibited in a hyperbolic fashion, the remaining part of the activity constituting about 5 to 20% of the overall activity. Quinacrine hydrochloride distributes according to the transmembrane ΔpH and its accumulation within the membrane vesicles, in response to an inward translocation of protons, gives rise to a quenching of its fluorescence (19Schuldiner S. Rottenberg H. Avron M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 20Bilous P.T. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 369-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been used herein to study the effects of the inhibitors on the nitrate reductase-dependent proton translocation in membrane preparations. These experiments were performed on membrane vesicles with overexpressed wild-type holoenzyme that possess an inside-out orientation with respect to the original cells. Addition of nitrate to the reaction cuvette containing the membrane vesicles and the electron donors (formate or quinol analogs) elicits a large quenching of fluorescence in rate and extent (Fig. 2). The energy-dependent quinacrine quenching in these particles can be prevented in three ways: (i) by uncouplers like carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (2 μm) suggesting that quinacrine distributes between the inner and outer compartments of the particles in response to a pH gradient rather than a membrane potential (21Jones R.W. FEBS Microbiol. Lett. 1980; 8: 167-171Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar); (ii) by low concentrations of azide (25 μm) sufficient to inhibit specifically the nitrate reductase activity as previously reported (22Garland P.B. Downie J.A. Haddock B.A. Biochem. J. 1975; 152: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and (iii) by adding inhibitors of quinol binding and oxidation (1Jones R.W. Lamont A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Bilous P.T. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 369-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, inhibitors such as myxothiazol and atrazin, which have no effect on the quinol-nitrate oxidoreductase activity, do not perturb the quenching of fluorescence (Fig. 2). Effective inhibitors of the nitrate reductase activity, HOQNO, stigmatellin, DCMU and antimycin A, inhibit proton extrusion as observed by the absence of fluorescence quenching. The inhibitory effect of HOQNO, stigmatellin and, to a lesser extent DCMU, on the nitrate reductase activity was further assessed by observing NarI heme reduction by menadiol and subsequent reoxidation by nitrate. This was done to investigate which step is modified by the inhibitors in the overall steady-state electron transfer from quinol to nitrate. The results are shown in Fig. 3 A. While quinol-dependent heme reduction is only slightly affected by the inhibitors, the extent of the nitrate-dependent heme reoxidation appears to be significantly decreased by HOQNO and stigmatellin (Fig. 3 A), and to a lesser extent by DCMU (data not shown). Adding HOQNO and stigmatellin at the same time to the assays does not lead to further modification of the behavior of the hemes (data not shown), suggesting that both inhibitors act at the same level in the electron transfer pathway. This contrasts with what is observed in the mitochondrial cytochrome bc 1 complex in which HOQNO and stigmatellin bind at separate sites on the opposite sides of the mitochondrial inner membrane (10von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To obtain further information on the location(s) of the inhibitor-binding sites, we studied heme reduction and reoxidation in a NarI-H66Y mutant devoid of heme b L, and in a NarI-H56R mutant devoid of heme b H (7Magalon A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Rothery R.A. Frixon C. Weiner J.H. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25652-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The reduction by menadiol of heme b L in the hemeb H-deficient mutant is severely impaired, and there is no reduction of the heme b H in the hemeb L-deficient mutant (Fig. 3 B). Similar results are obtained when the reduction is carried out with formate or duroquinol (data not shown). Once reduced, theb L heme in the NarI-H56R mutant cannot be reoxidized by nitrate (Fig. 3 B). The slow but total reduction of the heme b L in this mutant is not significantly impaired by HOQNO or stigmatellin (data not shown), in agreement with the results presented for the wild-type enzyme (see above). The kinetic behavior of each NarI mutant is fully in agreement with their inability to sustain anaerobic growth on nitrate and underlines the importance of the presence of both hemes for electron/proton transfer within NarGHI. It is generally accepted that in the presence of effective inhibitors, the most affected heme is that closest to the inhibitor binding site. We therefore examined the effect of inhibitors on the optical spectrum of the NarI hemes. As expected, no shifts are observed in the heme α-bands of reduced NarGHI in the presence of saturating amounts of myxothiazol, funiculosin, DBMIB, atrazin or UHDBT (data not shown). With the wild-type strain LCB2048/pVA700, the difference spectra observed after adding saturating amounts of HOQNO or stigmatellin to the reduced membrane vesicles are similar in shape (Fig. 4, traces 1 and4). These S-shaped curves have maxima and minima at 555.5 nm and 550.5 nm, respectively. The difference spectrum obtained after adding antimycin A or DCMU are similar in shape but much lower in amplitude in comparison to those observed with HOQNO and stigmatellin (data not shown). The spectral shifts obtained with the NarI-H66Y and NarI-H56R site-directed mutants devoid of heme b L and hemeb H, respectively, are also illustrated in Fig. 4. Similar HOQNO and stigmatellin induced-spectral shifts are obtained with both wild-type and heme b H-deficient mutants, suggesting that the heme located near the periplasmic side of the membrane (b L) is affected by the inhibitors (Fig. 4, traces 2 and 5). In the absence of hemeb L, no spectral shifts are observed in the presence of HOQNO and stigmatellin (Fig. 4, traces 3 and6). In the absence of heme b L, spectra observed in the presence of HOQNO and stigmatellin correspond to a slight oxidation of hemes due to the addition of inhibitors (Fig. 4, traces 3 and 6), suggesting that there is no interaction of the inhibitors with the remaining heme (hemeb H). Fig. 5 shows the effects of some of the inhibitors used herein on the EPR lineshapes of oxidized hemes b L andb H in the presence of HOQNO (B), stigmatellin (C), DCMU (D), and antimycin A (E). HOQNO elicits a change in the Gz of hemeb L from approximately 3.36 to 3.50, whereas stigmatellin appears to have the opposite effect on this heme, moving its Gz from 3.36 to approximately 3.31. DCMU and antimycin A appear to have no detectable effect on the EPR lineshape of hemeb L. None of the inhibitors tested appeared to have any effect on the Gz of heme b Hat approximately 3.76. In order to further characterize the position of the HOQNO/stigmatellin binding site(s) within NarI, we also studied the effects of these inhibitors on EPR spectra of membranes containing overexpressed NarI in the absence of the membrane-extrinsic catalytic dimer (7Magalon A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Rothery R.A. Frixon C. Weiner J.H. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25652-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the effect of the two most potent inhibitors, HOQNO and stigmatellin, on the lineshape of hemeb L, which has a Gz of 3.15 in the absence of NarGH. Neither inhibitor appears to have any effect on the Gz = 2.92 feature that we have previously attributed to conformationally relaxed or modified heme b. HOQNO elicits a change in the Gz of the remaining signal from 3.15 to approximately 3.45. In contrast to what was observed in the holoenzyme in Fig. 5, stigmatellin elicits a similar, but smaller shift in Gz to that observed with HOQNO, moving it to approximately 3.27. The sequence of NarI is remarkably conserved among the membrane-bound nitrate reductases from various organisms, and is proposed to have five transmembrane helices (I-V) with a periplasmic N terminus and a cytoplasmic C terminus (6Berks B.C.

Additional evidence for this model comes from the identification of the histidine ligands to the two hemes of this subunit (7Magalon A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Rothery R.A. Frixon C. Weiner J.H. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25652-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both hemes b Land b H are ligated by histidines located on helices II and V (7Magalon A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Rothery R.A. Frixon C. Weiner J.H. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25652-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and heme b H is located near the cytoplasmic surface and heme b L is located near the periplasmic surface. It has previously been shown that NarGHI releases protons into the periplasm during enzyme turnover (1Jones R.W. Lamont A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), raising the question of the exact location within the enzyme where proton release takes place. We have shown herein that the periplasmically localized heme b L is closely associated with a quinol binding site (QP), and this is consistent with a role for this quinol site-heme motif in proton release during enzyme turnover. We have used inhibitors to study the location of quinol-binding site(s) within NarGHI in much the same way as has been reported for the mitochondrial cytochrome bc 1 complex (24Kamensky-Konstantinov A.A. Kunz W.S. Surkov S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Howell N. Robertson D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11162-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Kunz W.S. Konstantinov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 155: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Ohnishi T. Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the latter enzyme in those cases where effects can be measured, the heme which is closest to the site of inhibitor binding is generally the most affected. Using a similar approach with NarGHI, we have investigated both the effects of inhibitors on the spectral properties of the hemes of NarI and their effects on heme reduction by menadiol and subsequent reoxidation by nitrate. Based on the lineshape perturbations in both EPR and optical experiments, it is clear that HOQNO and stigmatellin are able to bind at a site (QP) in close proximity to heme b L. However, HOQNO or stigmatellin binding at this location does not greatly affect the reducibility of both hemes by menadiol (see below). In contrast to the effect of the inhibitors on heme reduction, HOQNO and stigmatellin inhibit the extent of nitrate-dependent heme reoxidation (Fig. 3A). Possible explanations for this phenomenon include the following: Inhibitor binding in the vicinity of heme b L could significantly raise the E m,7 of the heme, resulting in it becoming non-nitrate oxidizable. HOQNO and stigmatellin have been shown to cause significant shifts in theE m,7s of Q-site associated prosthetic groups in other respiratory chain enzymes. For example, in Bacillus subtilis succinate:menaquinone oxidoreductase (SQR) addition of HOQNO causes a negative shift of the E m,7 of the Q-site associated heme b L (28Smirnova I.A. Hägerhäll C. Konstantinov A.A. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the cytochrome bc 1 complex, stigmatellin induces a large positive shift in the E m,7 of the Rieske center ([2Fe-2S] cluster), but has little effect on theE m,7 of the heme b L (25Howell N. Robertson D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11162-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Experiments are in progress in our laboratories to determine the effects of stigmatellin and HOQNO on the E m,7s of the two hemes of NarI. Inhibitor binding at this site would inhibit nitrate-dependent electron flow from NarI. The presence of such a site would be consistent with the effect of HOQNO on the EPR signal of a semiquinone radical species that has been observed in a previous study of mutants of NarH that lack the highest potential [4Fe-4S] cluster of this subunit (29Magalon A. Rothery R.A. Giordano G. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the elimination of the semiquinone radical species by HOQNO could be due to inhibition of electron transfer from the QP site (see preceding paragraph) rather than by displacement of the semiquinone species. In the B. subtilis SQR it has also been suggested that there are two quinol binding sites (30Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), one associated with hemeb L and one located near hemeb H and the S3 [3Fe-4S] cluster. Although there is evidence for the presence of a Qnr site in NarGHI (29Magalon A. Rothery R.A. Giordano G. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31Brito F. DeMoss J.A. Dubourdieu M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3728-3735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we believe that the simplest explanation for the data presented herein is that there is a single dissociable quinol binding site (QP) and that the Qnr site is non-dissociable (29Magalon A. Rothery R.A. Giordano G. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brito F. DeMoss J.A. Dubourdieu M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3728-3735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A proposed mechanism of HOQNO-inhibition of B. subtilis SQR has been suggested by Smirnova et al. (28Smirnova I.A. Hägerhäll C. Konstantinov A.A. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in which HOQNO acts as a semiquinone anion analog that displaces the physiological Q·̄2 intermediate arising from the succinate-dependent quinone reduction reaction at the quinone binding site. Such a proposal can be applied to the mechanism of quinol oxidation at the QP site of NarI. In the presence of HOQNO, the first oxidation step of the quinol (QH2 to Q·̄2) might occur allowing the reduction of the hemes, whereas the second step (Q·̄2 to Q) would be suppressed. This model for HOQNO inhibition would explain the residual enzyme activity observed at high concentrations of HOQNO (Fig. 1). The similarity between the inhibition profiles of HOQNO and stigmatellin suggests that their mechanisms of inhibition are identical. The data presented herein that suggests the presence of a QP site within NarGHI have to be reconciled with potential models for the mechanism of electron transfer and proton release. The observed midpoint potentials of the two hemes withb L (E m, 7-+17mV) located toward the periplasmic side and b H(E m, 7-+122mV) located toward the cytoplasmic side of NarI, respectively, suggests that physiological quinol oxidation occurs at the QP site, as previously suggested (6Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This would account for the proton release into the periplasm reported herein and elsewhere (1Jones R.W. Lamont A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Hemeb L reduction is only slightly affected in the heme b H deficient NarI-H56R mutant in comparison with the wild-type enzyme, and no reoxidation of hemeb L by nitrate is observed. On the other hand, no quinol-dependent reduction of hemeb H is observed in the hemeb L deficient NarI-H66Y mutant enzyme, in agreement with what has been observed in B. subtilis SQR (30Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). These observations support a model for quinol binding and oxidation in which dissociable binding occurs only at the hemeb L-associated Qp site. In this model the electron flow through NarI occurs successively via hemeb L and heme b H from the periplasmic side to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, allowing subsequent reduction of the [Fe-S] clusters of the NarH subunit. It has been suggested that there is a second non-dissociable site of quinol binding associated with the NarGH catalytic dimer (31Brito F. DeMoss J.A. Dubourdieu M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3728-3735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Qnr site may be located between the hemes of NarI and the [Fe-S] clusters of NarH. The quinone normally localized at this site may be functioning as an electron conduit in much the same way as the QA site of the bacterial photoreaction center. The possible presence of a Qnr site located between hemeb H of NarI and the [Fe-S] clusters of NarH bears interesting comparison with results reported for a similar anaerobic reductase of E. coli, Me2SO reductase (DmsABC) (32Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This enzyme has a similar subunit and prosthetic group composition to that of NarGHI, except that its membrane anchor subunit (DmsC) does not contain heme. In DmsABC, the EPR lineshape of a [3Fe-4S] cluster introduced into DmsB by site-directed mutagenesis is significantly altered by HOQNO binding. It is possible that the NarGHI Qnr site might correspond to the site observed in the [3Fe-4S] mutant of DmsABC, although in the latter case the site appears to be dissociable. Overall, we have clearly demonstrated by kinetic, optical, and EPR measurements, the presence of a quinol binding site (QP) within NarGHI that is associated with heme b L of NarI, and is located toward the cytoplasmic side of NarI. Our results suggest that this QP site is responsible for physiological quinol oxidation and proton release into the periplasm (29 and this work). These results represent an important step in delineating the mechanisms of quinol oxidation, electron transfer, and proton release by NarGHI. We thank Dr. Wolfgang Nitschke for helpful discussions."

The exposure of the MUC-1 tandem repeats on the cell surface of malignant cells combined with the ability of the immune system to respond specifically to these peptide epitopes offers an ideal opportunity to rationally design appropriate synthetic vaccines to target this tumor-associated antigen. Recent vaccination studies in humans using a MUC-1 dimer conjugated with diphtheria toxoid showed that the formulation used was not sufficiently immunogenic (11Xing P.X. Apostolopoulos V. Prenzoska J. Marshall C. Bishop J. McKenzie I.F.C. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 6: 1283-1289PubMed Google Scholar). This, perhaps, is not surprising as one or two repeats do not attain a native conformation, whereas peptides consisting of three or more repeats take a rod-shaped ordered structure (12Fontenot J.D. Tjandra N. Bu D. Ho C. Montelaro R.C. Finn O.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5386-5394PubMed Google Scholar). A five-repeat peptide has been reported to induce enhanced antigenicity (13Kotera Y. Fontenot J.D. Pecher G. Metzgar R.S. Finn O.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2856-2860PubMed Google Scholar), and the results of a phase I vaccination trial were encouraging (14Goydos J.S. Elder E.

In the present study we exploited the recent advances in convergent solid-phase synthesis (CSPP) to reliably prepare and evaluate MUC-1 oligomers up to five repeats and MUC-1 oligomer derivatives with a 15-aa epitope from tetanus toxin. The 20-mer MUC-1 fragment 6 and the 15-mer ttp fragment 7 (Fig. 1) as well as smaller MUC-1 fragments (Table I) were synthesized by an automated solid-phase Fmoc strategy (430A Peptide Synthesizer, Applied Biosystems) with theN-methylpyrrolidinone-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (NMP-DCC) method according to the manufacturer's instructions, modified to take 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin (CLTR). The solid-phase support was in all cases CLTR. Protected amino acids and CLTR were obtained from CBL Patras (Patra, Greece). NMP, dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane (DCM), acetonitrile, methanol, trifluoroacetic acid, acetic acid, and diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) were obtained from Merck (Germany). DCC, ethanedithiol, thioanisole, phenol, piperidine, trifluoroethanol (TFE), and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) were obtained from Sigma.Table IPeptides synthesized and used in the studySequences of peptides synthesized by sequencial condensation MUC-1 (20 aa)PAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAP MUC-1 immunodominant epitope (ID) (6 aa)APDTRP 9-aa fragment containing the ID epitopeSAPDTRPAP 9-aa fragment without the ID epitopeSTAPPAHGV Tetanus toxin peptide (ttp) 15 aaQYIKANSKFIGITELMUC-1 oligomers synthesized by fragment condensation MUC-1 1-mer 20 aa(PAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAP)1 MUC-1 2-mer 40 aa(PAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAP)2 MUC-1 3-mer 60 aa(PAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAP)3 MUC-1 4-mer 80 aa(PAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAP)4 MUC-1 5-mer 100 aa(PAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAP)5ttp-MUC-1 heterotope derivatives synthesized by fragment condensation ttp-(MUC-1)1, 35 aaQYIKANSKFIGITEL-(PAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAP)1 ttp-(MUC-1)2, 55 aaQYIKANSKFIGITEL-(PAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAP)2 ttp-(MUC-1)3, 75 aaQYIKANSKFIGITEL-(PAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAP)3 ttp-(MUC-1)4, 95 aaQYIKANSKFIGITEL-(PAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAP)4 ttp-(MUC-1)5, 115 aaQYIKANSKFIGITEL-(PAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAP)5 Open table in a new tab For the synthesis of the required protected fragment6 and of the protected fragment 7 (Fig. 1) we used the acid labile Fmoc/t-butyl amino acids. Trityl was applied for the protection of the side chains of His and Ser. Pmc (2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl) was applied for Arg. This protection scheme allowed the mildest possible deprotection conditions of the final protected peptide. The solid support CLTR was chosen because it effectively suppresses diketopiperazin formation during the synthesis of peptides containing Pro (15Barlos K. Gatos D. Kallitsis J. Papaphotiou G.

Chatzi O. Gatos D. Stavropoulos G. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1991; 37: 513-520PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of 6 was initiated with the esterification of Fmoc-Pro-OH 1 on 1 g CLTR 2 with DIPEA in DMF, to yield Fmoc-Pro-O-CLTR 3. Unreacted remaining trityl chloride functions were converted to the corresponding methyl ether by washing the resin three times with methanol/DIPEA/DCM (15:5:80) for 5 min each. Fmoc removal was performed immediately after the end of the esterification procedure by treating with 25% piperidine in DMF to obtain resin 4 with a substitution of 0.3 mmol of Pro/g of resin. The peptide chain was elongated using DCC/HOBt as the condensing agent, NMP as the solvent, and 25% piperidine in NMP for the removal of Fmoc. Finally, the obtained resin peptide ester 5 (Fig. 1) was treated at room temperature for 60 min with a 3:7 mixture of TFE/DCM. Protected peptide 6 was recovered after solvent evaporation in vacuum, precipitation with water, filtration and drying in ether. The protected ttp 7 was synthesized by similar methods. A small scale pilot synthesis was performed by condensing a 2-fold molar excess of protected fragment 6 over the resin-bound amino component 5. The protected fragment was applied as a 0.05 m solution in Me2SO and with condensing agent DCC/HOBt. After 24 h of condensation, unreacted remaining amino groups were capped by acetylation using a 10-fold molar excess of acetic anhydride and DIPEA in NMP. The amino-terminal Fmoc group was then removed by treatment with 25% piperidine in NMP. Completion of the Fmoc removal was checked by TLC (19Barlos K. Gatos D. Kapolos S. Poulos C. Schäfer W. Wenqing Y. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1991; 38: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After each condensation, the resin-bound peptide was cleaved deprotected and analyzed by reverse phase-HPLC. Portions of the resins with the oligomers still attached were used for the synthesis of the ttp-MUC-1 heterotope derivatives 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 (Fig. 2) using the same strategy. Protected ttp 7 was dissolved in Me2SO (0.05 m) activated with DCC-HOBt and reacted with the MUC-1 oligomer resins 5, 9, 11, 13, 15(Fig. 2) in two-molar excess for 24 h. In a second CSPP preparation of the 5-mer MUC-1 we started with a new synthesis of resin 5 that condensed with the protected MUC-16 four times in succession, introducing the following modifications: (i) a lower proline substitution in resin5 (0.1 mmol/g resin); (ii) a more concentrated solution of 6 (0.1 m); (iii) each fragment was applied in three-fold molar excess; and (iv) DCC was replaced by DIC as the dehydrating agent. After the final coupling step, all synthesized peptides were treated with 25% piperidine for removal of the Fmoc, washed with diethyl ether, and dried. The cleavage and deprotection was performed with a trifluoroacetic acid:water:phenol:ethanedithiol:thioanisole solution (82.5:5:5:2.5:5) for 2 h at room temperature. The crude peptides were precipitated in ice-cold ether, washed several times with ether, dried, dissolved in water, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C until used. The peptides synthesized for the present study are listed in Table I. HPLC was performed in the Waters 600 LC system (Waters) with a UV 486 detector using a semipreparative C18 column (Synchropack RP-P 250 × 7.8-mm, Synchrom Inc.). SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was performed with the Phast system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden), and the gels were stained with silver nitrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gel transfer to nitrocellulose (Biotrace NT, Gelman Sciences, Germany) was performed with passive diffusion with transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, containing 20% methanol) for 15 min. The membranes were either silver-stained directly (20Kovaric A. Hlubinova K. Vrbenska A. Prachar J. Folia Biol. (Prague). 1987; 33: 253-257PubMed Google Scholar) or blocked with 2% gelatin in 10 mmTris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and used for Western blotting. For the Western blotting studies, mouse anti-MUC-1 monoclonal antibody BC-2 was incubated at 1:2000 with the blotted membrane in 10 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% gelatin for 1 h at room temperature. After washing excess reagents, rabbit anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate was added in the same buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The reactions were revealed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-nitro blue tetrazolium as substrate (21Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russel-Jones G.H. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Mass spectrograms of MUC-1 pentamer were kindly performed by Prof. Giovanni Sidonna (Calabria, Italy), using a Fisons EC-VG platform mass spectrometer. The assay was performed essentially as described previously (22Krambovitis E. Tselentis J. Tsoukatos D. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 89: 129-136Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, MUC-1 oligomers were immobilized onto flat-bottomed microtiter wells (NUNC, Denmark) by overnight incubation in 50 mm carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The wells were blocked with 1% gelatin in 50 mmPBS, pH 7.0, for 1 h at room temperature and washed with 0.1% Tween in PBS. Murine monoclonal anti-MUC-1 antibody (BC-2) in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to each well (100 μl) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The BC-2 antibody (IgG1) with specificity to peptide epitope APDTR of MUC-1 (1Devine P.L. McKenzie F.C. BioAssays. 1992; 9: 619-625Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. P.-X. Xing (Austin Research Institute, Heidelberg, Australia). After washing off excess antibody, a second incubation with a rabbit anti-mouse antibody-peroxidase conjugate (100 μl) followed for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes with PBS the antigen-antibody reaction was revealed by adding to each well 100 μl of substrate (0.25 mm tetramethyl benzidine, 0.03% v/v hydrogen peroxide in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2) (23Hatzidakis G. Stefanakis A. Krambovitis E. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 97: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped after 15 min by the addition of 50 μl 2m sulfuric acid per well. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm (Multiscan, Flow Labs, Finland). The monoclonal anti-MUC-1 antibody BC-2 was diluted 1:6000 in PBS with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. 150-μl aliquots were admixed with equal volumes of various peptides in serial dilutions or with an equal volume of PBS (control). The mixtures were dispensed (100 μl) into MUC-1 pentamer-coated wells (2 μg/ml) in duplicate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After removing unreacted reagents, 100 μl of diluted rabbit anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate were dispensed to each well and incubated at 37 °C for a further 1 h. The antigen-antibody reaction was revealed as described above. Inhibition was measured by the decrease in binding of the antibody compared with the control. The repetition of the MUC-1 20-mer peptide is an attractive model with which to study the efficiency of the convergent approach for the solid-phase synthesis of large peptides and small proteins (24Lloyd-Williams P.

The method is based on the principle that protected peptide fragments corresponding to the entire protein sequence can be condensed sequentially on a suitable solid support. We applied this method for the synthesis of MUC-1 oligomers using Fmoc amino acids and 2-chlorotrityl resin as the solid support (15Barlos K. Gatos D. Kallitsis J. Papaphotiou G. Sotiriou P. Wenqing Y. Schafer W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 3943-3946Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Our synthesis strategy for the preparation of MUC-1 oligomers utilized the sequential condensation of the protected peptide 6(Figs. 1 and2). The aa sequence of this peptide was designed to contain the immunodominant epitope APDTRP in the interior of the peptide so that each repeated unit would contain one epitope and prolines at positions 1 and 20. The rationale for our choice was that: (i) the optical stability of proline at the C-terminal position of the electrophilically activated fragment would ensure the optical purity of the resulting oligomers; (ii) fragment6 was soluble in the solvent used (Me2SO) as required for a successful solid-phase condensation reaction; and (iii) both the free NZ-function of the resin-bound amino component as well as the C-terminal function of the applied carboxy component were exposed and easily reached by the other reactants. This could not be the case if completely formed β-turns were contained in one of the reactive terminal positions. We anticipated that the presence of several β-turn and β-sheet destructive Pro residues in the peptide chain, especially at both N- and C-terminal positions of the 20-mer, would impede β-turn formations and enhance peptide solubility. The selected MUC-1 20-aa protected sequence had the required reactivity at both terminal positions. The protected 20-aa fragment 6 was synthesized starting with the esterification of Fmoc-Pro-OH 1 with CLTR 2(Fig. 1) (15Barlos K. Gatos D. Kallitsis J. Papaphotiou G. Sotiriou P. Wenqing Y. Schafer W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 3943-3946Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The obtained resin-bound proline derivative3, with a loading of 0.3 mmol of Pro/g of resin was deprotected at the amino function soon after the esterification reaction by treatment with 25% piperidine in DMF. This step was considered very important in order to avoid premature cleavage of the amino acid from the resin due to slow hydrolysis of unreacted trityl chloride residues. This in turn could cause evolution of hydrogen chloride, which subsequently affects the cleavage of the extremely acid-sensitive bond of the amino acid to the resin (18Barlos K. Chatzi O. Gatos D. Stavropoulos G. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1991; 37: 513-520PubMed Google Scholar). Chain elongation starting from resin 4 was performed by applying a three-fold molar excess of the Fmoc amino acids preactivated by DCC/HOBt. For the side-chain protection of the amino acids,t-butyl-type groups were applied, trityl for the protection of the side chains of His (15Barlos K. Gatos D. Kallitsis J. Papaphotiou G. Sotiriou P. Wenqing Y. Schafer W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 3943-3946Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and Ser (16Barlos K. Gatos D. Kapolos S. Papaphotiou G. Schafer W. Wenqing Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 3947-3950Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and Pmc for the guanidino function of Arg (25Ramage R. Grenn J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1987; 28: 2287-2290Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Completion of the coupling reactions was determined by the Kaiser test and of the Fmoc removal by TLC. Due to the presence of the very sensitive Nim-trityl-histidine moieties in the sequence of the MUC-1 20-aa peptide, the cleavage of the protected fragment 5 from the resin after the completion of the synthesis was effected by TFE/DCM (3:7) and not as in the usual treatment with acetic acid or 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol-DCM mixtures. We obtained by this method a crude protected peptide6 in 96% yield and 97% purity as revealed by HPLC analysis of the peptide after deprotection (Fig. 3 a). The high purity of the fragment allowed us to use it directly in the fragment condensation reactions (Fig. 2) without further purification. In addition, the absence of acetic acid from the cleavage mixture, which is responsible for extensive acetylations of the resin-bound amino components, allowed the use of the fragment 6 without prior reprecipitation from TFE/water (26Barlos K. Gatos D. Schafer W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 590-593Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly, the protected ttp 7 was synthesized in 95% yield and 96% purity. Initially, we commenced the synthesis of MUC-1 oligomers using the resin 5 with a loading of 0.3 mmol of Pro/g of resin. This first preparation showed incomplete condensations during the synthesis of the di-, tri-, tetra- and pentamers 9, 11, 13, 15 (Fig. 3, b-e). HPLC analysis of the final deprotected crude products indicated that condensation of 6 with the tetramer to form the pentamer proceeded at room temperature for 24 h and gave a yield less than 40% (Fig. 3 e). To overcome the difficulties of the condensation reactions, we made the following modifications in the CSPP. We used a lower proline substitution (0.1 mmol/g resin). This was important because in proceeding with the condensation reactions, the peptide/resin weight ratio increased and considerably altered the swelling properties of the resin. Resins with a high peptide loading reveal an increased polarity of the polystyrene matrix. Therefore, movement of large polar molecules such as the free protected peptide fragments, is restricted through polar interactions with support and can reach only with difficulty the reactive NH2-terminal positions of the resin-bound amino component. We also applied a more concentrated solution of 6and three-fold molar excess of fragment 6 over the resin-bound component 5, using the condensing agent DIC/HOBt (1:1.5) in Me2SO instead of DCC. This aspect was considered important as we speculated that during the long-lasting condensation reactions dicyclohexyl urea could precipitate and block the resin pores hindering the movement of the protected fragments inside the resin. The improved condensation yields that resulted from the above changes allowed us to prepare the peptide oligomers on a larger scale. The starting resin 5 (0.1 mmol/g resin) was condensed with the protected MUC-1 6 four times in succession thus resulting in the formation of the pentamer MUC-1. The yield and purity of the crude MUC-1 pentamer peptide were satisfactory as shown by HPLC analysis (Fig. 4 b) and compared with the first preparation (Fig. 4 c) thus allowing us to obtain the pentamer in a highly purified form after HPLC purification (Fig. 4 a). The molecular weight of the MUC-1 pentamer determined by mass spectroscopy (Fig. 5) was in agreement with the expected molecular weight as calculated from the amino acid content .Figure 5Mass spectrogram of the MUC-1 pentamer peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The synthetic MUC-1 oligomer peptides exhibited unusual behavior in SDS-PAGE. The peptides could not be visualized directly on the polyacrylamide gels because they could be not fixed by methanol/acetic acid, glutaraldehyde, or trichloroacetic acid. The electrophoretic properties were studied when the oligomers were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane with passive diffusion immediately after the electrophoretic separation and by the silver staining, which followed (20Kovaric A. Hlubinova K. Vrbenska A. Prachar J. Folia Biol. (Prague). 1987; 33: 253-257PubMed Google Scholar). The monomer and dimer peptides were not visualized at all, probably due to insufficient amounts being transferred onto the nitrocellulose (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2). The other oligomers (3-mer, 4-mer, and 5-mer) became clearly visible. They appeared to migrate slowly with the same electrophoretic rate (Fig. 6, lanes 3–5) although the oligomers differed from each other by 20 and 40 aa in length. This anomaly may be attributed to the high proline content and alanine-proline sequences that have been reported to alter the charge and conformation of the SDS-polypeptide complex (27Frank G. Weeds A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Hung C.H. Ohno M. Freytag J.W. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

In contrast, the ttp-MUC-1 heterotope derivatives showed normal electrophoretic behavior, probably due to the influencing presence of the ttp fragment (Fig. 7). These peptides were easily fixed onto polyacrylamide gels and stained with silver nitrate. Electrophoretic studies from the first preparation of the ttp-MUC-1 heterotope derivatives (TableI) showed the anticipated ascending molecular weight order from ttp to ttp-5-mer (Fig. 7, lanes 1–8) and clearly demonstrated the incompletion of the reactions during the synthesis of the 3-mer, 4-mer, and 5-mer as had also been observed by HPLC analysis. It was noted that the ttp-MUC-1 heterotope derivatives could not be separated by HPLC as they were all eluted simultaneously from the gradient systems we applied (Fig. 8). This phenomenon may be attributed to the dominating hydrophobic nature of the ttp peptide, equally affecting the elution of the different derivatives.Figure 8HPLC analysis of ttp-(MUC-1)1–3showing increasing racemization as the length of MUC-1 oligomers increased; (a), ttp-(MUC-1)3; (b), ttp-(MUC-1)2; (c), ttp-(MUC-1)1. HPLC was performed in a semipreparative C18 column, and the eluent was monitored at 220 nm. An elution gradient from acetonitrile containing 0.1% tri-fluoroacetic acid:water was applied for 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, from 15 to 40% acetonitrile.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As expected, the condensation of the protected ttp fragment with the resin-bound MUC-1 oligomers proceeded with the partial racemization of the C-terminal leucine residue. In fact, we observed that two distinct peaks were always present in the reverse phase-HPLC elution profile for each derivative. The two components corresponding to the l- andd-enantiomers of the derivatives were separated by semipreparative HPLC. Both showed identical electrophoretic properties (Fig. 7, lanes 6 and 7), exactly the same molecular weight and the same amino acid ratio as determined by aa analysis of the ttp-MUC-1 5-mer. The percentage of racemization appeared to increase in proportion to the length of MUC-1 oligomer. This was due to the slower fragment condensation reactions leading to a longer exposure of the activated ttp in the racemization prone benzotriazoyl ester state prior to condensation (Fig. 8). The murine monoclonal antibody BC-2 was titrated against equal amounts of MUC-1 oligomers in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 9). The results showed a characteristic preference of the antibody for the oligomers and much less for the monomer in agreement with previous observations (12Fontenot J.D. Tjandra N. Bu D. Ho C. Montelaro R.C. Finn O.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5386-5394PubMed Google Scholar). This was also demonstrated in Western blotting using a mixture of the ttp-MUC-1 oligomers (Fig. 7, lane 9) where ttp-(MUC-1)1did not give any visible immunoreaction, whereas all the other oligomer derivatives reacted with the monoclonal antibody. Finally, in an inhibition enzyme immunoassay study of the monoclonal antibody by a range of peptides (Fig. 10 and TableI), it was demonstrated that free MUC-1 oligomers were more efficient inhibitors than the monomer and the APDTRP epitope. The control peptide STAPPAHGV, which represented a region of MUC-1 exclusive of the immunodominant epitope, did not react with the antibody. These results strongly support the suggestion that as the number of MUC-1 tandem repeats increases, the epitopes may attain a structure closer to native conformation of unglycosylated mucin and become more immunogenic (12Fontenot J.D. Tjandra N. Bu D. Ho C. Montelaro R.C. Finn O.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5386-5394PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 10Competitive inhibition enzyme immunoassay of the APDPTRP-recognizing monoclonal antibody by a range of synthetic peptides. The plates were coated with the MUC-1 pentamer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Synthesis of large peptides such as the ones required for immunotherapeutic and vaccination studies is difficult to achieve with a sequential extension approach as the reaction efficiency decreases dramatically with the increasing size of the peptide beyond 30–40 aa, affecting both purity and yields. Recent advances in peptide chemistry for cleaving peptides from resins under extremely mild conditions allowed us to adopt an improved convergent solid-phase peptide synthesis strategy and prepare MUC-1 oligomers under controlled conditions up to five repeats and derivatives of the same oligomers with a tetanus toxin T cell epitope. HPLC and mass spectroscopy analysis confirmed the purity and correct size of the pentamer MUC-1, and immunological studies demonstrated that the oligomers were recognized as specific antigens by anti-mucin antibodies. The construction of large composite synthetic peptides, such as those demonstrated here, offers a rational approach to designing and studying synthetic vaccines with defined structural and accessory epitopes as a means of evoking precise immune responses, which are required in immunotherapy.

Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and is an efficient inhibitor of either active two-chain urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) or tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Although definitive in vivo evidence of the function of PAI-2 remains to be established, kinetic data, molecular regulation, and expression of PAI-2 by a wide range of cell types strongly suggests that PAI-2 plays an important role in many physiological and pathological processes such as pregnancy, skin differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, and cancer (2Sumiyoshi K. Serizawa K. Urano T. Takada Y. Takada A. Baba S. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 50: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In general, serpins interact with their target proteases through an exposed peptide loop, known as the reactive site loop (RSL), which acts as a form of “suicide” substrate leading to the formation of a serpin-protease complex. As the crystal structure of a serpin-protease complex has yet to be determined, the precise nature of the interaction between serpin and protease remains somewhat controversial. However, an extensive review of the literature (3Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function, and Biology. Chapman & Hall, New York1996Google Scholar) has led to a proposed mechanism involving formation of a tetrahedral intermediate in which the RSL is partially inserted into β-sheet A, followed sequentially by cleavage of the P1–P1′ bond, formation of an acyl intermediate, release of the C-terminal part of the inhibitor, and complete insertion of the RSL as the central strand (s4A) of β-sheet A. Complete RSL insertion is considered essentially irreversible and, along with associated conformational changes, may distort the active site geometry of the enzyme, preventing deacylation and trapping both proteins in a stable complex. Slow hydrolysis can then occur to regenerate active protease and release a cleaved, inactive form of the serpin. Examination of the molecular interactions involved in RSL insertion are essential for a complete understanding of the serpin inhibitory mechanism and for the development of biochemical probes to determine biologically relevant expression of serpin activity. Despite uncertainty over the precise nature of the serpin inhibitory mechanism, it is clear that inhibition involves insertion of the RSL into β-sheet A of the serpin and transition to a more stable thermodynamic state, known as the relaxed (R) form of the inhibitor (4Gettins P. Patston P.A. Schapira M. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North. Am. 1992; 6: 1393-1408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct.

Transition to the R state involves dramatic conformational changes in the serpin molecule, with the P1 and P1′ residues separated by approximately 70 Å following complete loop insertion. Other conformational shifts may involve β-sheet C, α-helix F, and other strands of β-sheet A (5Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We contend that PAI-2, as a member of the serpin family of proteins, undergoes the stressed to relaxed (S-R) conformational transition in association with inhibition of potential target proteases (e.g. uPA and tPA), as observed for several other inhibitory serpins.

This study describes for the first time the induction of relaxed PAI-2 by insertion of a synthetic RSL peptide and characterization of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed specifically against an epitope expressed on this conformation of PAI-2. This immunological probe will assist in determining the mechanisms involved in the inhibition of potential target proteases and hence the physiological and/or pathological roles of the unique serpin PAI-2. Recombinant (Escherichia coli) human PAI-2 and goat anti-human PAI-2 polyclonal antibody was a kind gift from Biotech Australia (Sydney, Australia). Human two-chain uPA was from Serono (Sydney, Australia). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that uPA in this preparation existed mainly in the 55-kDa form. Human two-chain tPA was from American Diagnostica Inc. (Sydney, Australia) and was reconstituted in PBS and stored at −20 °C before use. Thrombin (bovine, plasminogen-free) was from Calbiochem (Sydney, Australia) and before use was reconstituted in PBS and stored at −20 °C. Synthetic PAI-2 RSL peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method using an ABI 430A peptide synthesizer and optimized tert-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry protocols (13Kent S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 957-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) Crude product was purified to homogeneity by preparative reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a wide pore C18 column with an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were subsequently characterized by mass spectrometry and amino acid composition analysis. RSL peptides were acetylated at the N terminus and were synthesized corresponding to different length sections of the reactive site loop of PAI-2. Each peptide was successively shortened by two residues from the N terminus with the 14-mer having the sequence H-Ac-TEAAAGTGGVMTGR-OH. uPA·PAI-2 complexes were produced by incubating equimolar amounts of uPA and PAI-2 for 2 h at 37 °C. uPA (55 kDa)·PAI-2 complexes were separated from uncomplexed PAI-2, uPA, polymerized PAI-2, and uPA (33 kDa)·PAI-2 complexes by FPLC on a Mono-S HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled where appropriate, concentrated, and desalted with Centricon-10 microconcentrators (Amicon, Sydney). PAI-2·RSL complexes were prepared by incubating active “stressed” PAI-2 at 1 mg·ml−1 with a 100-fold molar excess of the RSL peptide in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 at 37 °C for 48 h. The tPA/PAI-2 reaction mixture was prepared by incubating equimolar amounts of tPA and PAI-2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Thrombin-treated PAI-2 was prepared by incubating equimolar amounts of thrombin and PAI-2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Since PAI-2 does not form complexes with thrombin (14Kruithof E.K. Vassalli J.D. Schleuning W.D. Mattaliano R.J. Bachmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11207-11213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), purification of PAI-2 from thrombin was not deemed necessary. Mice were immunized with uPA·PAI-2 complexes. Boosting and polyethylene glycol-induced fusion of splenic lymphocytes with mouse plasmacytoma (NS-1) cells was performed as described previously (15Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12717) Google Scholar). Hybridomas were screened for reactivity against purified uPA·PAI-2 complexes (and negative reactivity against uPA or PAI-2 alone) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the antibodies produced by the selected hybridoma clone (2H5) were determined to be of the IgG1κsubclass. 2V. McPhun, L. Maxwell, and M. S. Baker, manuscript in preparation. The 2H5-producing hybridoma clones were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CSL, Melbourne, Australia) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (CSL). Hybridoma-conditioned medium was centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min, precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate with continual stirring for 6 h at 4 °C, and then dialyzed against three changes of PBS overnight. Further purification was achieved using Protein G Superose FPLC affinity chromatography equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7). Elution was achieved with 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.7). Fractions (1 ml) were neutralized by the addition of 200 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9) and dialyzed against three changes of PBS at 4 °C overnight. Unless otherwise stated, 4–20% Tris/glycine precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Sydney, Australia) under nonreducing conditions were used for analysis of protein-containing fractions collected from FPLC, checking the integrity of uPA and PAI-2 standards, or confirming the purity of all mAb preparations. Gels were routinely run at 150 V for 1 h in Tris/glycine running buffer (pH 6.8). In order to conserve the native conformation of proteins being investigated by Western blotting, nondenaturing (native) gel electrophoresis was employed. Samples were routinely run on 4–10% gradient gels for 1 h at 150 V in 90 mm Tris, 80 mm borate, 3 mm EDTA buffer (pH 8.2) (16Blanche P.J. Gong E.L. Forte T.M. Nichols A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Sample (100 μg of protein) was diluted 1:1 with native PAGE sample buffer and loaded onto 7% acrylamide gels containing a linear 0–8 m urea gradient. Gels were run at 30 mA for 70 min using Tris/glycine running buffer (17Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on a Hitachi F4500 spectrofluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Measurements were performed at a PAI-2 concentration of 0.4 μm in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl. Data are presented as the fraction of protein denatured, calculated as (λnative − λ)/(λnative − λdenatured), where λnative is the emission wavelength maximum of native PAI-2, λ is the emission wavelength maximum of the individual sample, and λdenatured is the emission wavelength maximum of completely denatured PAI-2 (18Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 311-329Google Scholar). Specific activity of PAI-2 was determined by inhibition of uPA-mediated hydrolysis of carbobenzoxy-l-γ-glutamyl-(α-t-butoxy)-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide-diacetate (2.0 mm) in the Spectrolyse® UK assay (American Diagnostica). Statistical comparison of mean activity was performed using Student's t test. Titretek PVC microtiter plates (Flow Laboratories) were routinely coated with 50 μl of antigen (3 μg·ml−1) in PBS for 1 h at 37 °. Plates were washed with PBS/Tween, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 50 μl of 1% casein in PBS/Tween at 37 °C for 1 h or at 4 °C overnight. 50 μl of purified mAb 2H5 in PBS was then applied, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Plates were then washed and incubated with 50 μl of 1:3000 alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (γ-chain-specific) second antibody (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h. Plates were finally washed three times with 150 μl of carbonate buffer (pH 9.1). Color development was measured at 405 nm following the addition of 50 μl of ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate (Boehringer Mannheim, Sydney, Australia) at 1 mg·ml−1 in carbonate buffer (pH 9.1) at 37 °C. Color development was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 3 mNaOH. Following native PAGE, proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Sydney, Australia) in prechilled Tris/glycine transfer buffer at 100 V for 1 h or 30 V overnight. Antibody-antigen interactions were detected using the Immuno-Blot assay kit (Bio-Rad), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Nonspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with 3% gelatin/Tris-buffered saline, and the membrane was incubated in primary antibody (mAb 2H5) diluted 1:1500 in 1% gelatin, 0.05% Tween-20, Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated for 1 h in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse second antibody diluted 1:3000. To investigate the stability of PAI-2·RSL complexes, resistance to denaturation by urea was analyzed using TUG gels. Fig. 1 A, a characteristic denaturation profile of native recombinant PAI-2, shows greatly reduced electrophoretic mobility of the protein at higher urea concentrations. This profile is indicative of increasing denaturation over the corresponding urea gradient. The denaturation curve of PAI-2 incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of 14-mer RSL peptide shows a major curve comprising a series of three bands. In contrast to native PAI-2, the electrophoretic mobility of the PAI-2·14-mer RSL complex is not significantly reduced at higher concentrations of urea, indicating increased resistance to denaturation and hence a more stable conformation. PAI-2 incubated with RSL peptides lacking both the P13 (Glu) and P14 (Thr) residues displayed denaturation curves similar to native PAI-2 (data not shown). Measurement of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectrum of PAI-2 over a urea gradient (Fig. 1 B) shows an unfolding pattern comparable with that observed by TUG-PAGE. The urea concentration at half-maximal unfolding of native PAI-2 ([urea]½) was calculated to be 6.4 m, and a predicted ΔG(H2O) of 4.693 kcal/mol was obtained. In contrast, PAI-2 incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of 14-mer RSL peptide was extremely resistant to denaturation even at high concentrations of urea, confirming results obtained by TUG-PAGE. Because an unfolding transition was not observed for this complex, the ΔG(H2O) and [urea]½ could not be confidently predicted. PAI-2 incubated with 12-mer RSL peptide, lacking both the P13 (Glu) and P14 (Thr) residues, displayed a denaturation curve and predicted ΔG(H2O) matching native PAI-2. These data show that the interaction of PAI-2 with the 14-mer RSL peptide induced resistance to urea denaturation, indicating a significant increase in conformational stability of native PAI-2. Incubation of PAI-2 with varying molar ratios of 14-mer RSL peptide for 48 h at 37 °C and subsequent analysis by fluorescence spectroscopy showed that resistance to urea denaturation increased as the molar ratio of peptide increased, approaching a maximum at a 100-fold excess (Fig. 2). Similarly, inhibition of PAI-2 activity increased as the molar ratio of peptide increased, reaching a maximum at a 100-fold excess (data not shown). CD spectra from 200 nm in the far UV region to 300 nm in the near UV region of stressed PAI-2 (i.e. no peptide) and PAI-2 incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of RSL peptides were measured. Fig. 3 clearly indicates a dramatic shift in the spectrum of PAI-2 following incubation with the 14-mer RSL peptide, indicating a significant conformational transition. No significant shift was observed in the CD spectra of PAI-2 incubated with shorter peptides lacking the P13 and P14 residues (data not shown). To ascertain if incubation of PAI-2 with the synthetic RSL peptides altered the ability of the serpin to act as an inhibitor, the uPA-specific inhibitory activities of native PAI-2 and PAI-2·RSL complexes were measured. The uPA-specific inhibitory activity of native PAI-2 was determined to be approximately 1.8 × 105IU/mg (Fig. 4). The inhibitory activity of PAI-2 incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of RSL peptides ranging in size from 12 to 6 residues (i.e.. lacking both the P13 (Glu) and P14 (Thr) residues) was not significantly different from that of native PAI-2. However, incubation of PAI-2 with a 100-fold molar excess of 14-mer RSL peptide significantly decreased inhibitory activity to almost undetectable levels (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). In addition, SDS-PAGE analysis and N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicated that the PAI-2·14-mer RSL complex behaved as a substrate of uPA. Two N-terminal sequences, corresponding to the N terminus of PAI-2 and the sequence from Thr381 (P1′) onwards, were detected within 30 s of uPA addition, indicating cleavage of the P1–P1′ bond of PAI-2. No evidence of formation of complexes between uPA and the PAI-2·14mer RSL complex was apparent by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). To screen hybridomas for antibodies that specifically detected relaxed PAI-2 but not native PAI-2 or uPA, it was necessary to produce purified uPA·PAI-2 complexes free of any traces of uPA or native stressed PAI-2 remaining in the reaction mixture. Purification of uPA (55 kDa)·PAI-2 complexes from residual uncomplexed uPA and PAI-2, dimerized PAI-2, and uPA (33 kDa)·PAI-2 complexes remaining in the reaction mixture was achieved by ion exchange FPLC. A significant peak eluted from the column prior to increasing the salt concentration and was shown by SDS-PAGE to represent residual uncomplexed PAI-2 (data not shown). A peak eluting at 0.2 m NaCl represented uPA (33 kDa)·PAI-2 complexes, while another at 0.3–0.35 mNaCl contained only uPA (55 kDa)·PAI-2 complexes (data not shown). At higher salt concentrations (>0.5 m), two smaller peaks were visible, representing uncomplexed uPA (33 kDa) and uPA (55 kDa), respectively (data not shown). This method provided sufficient quantities of highly pure uPA (55 kDa)·PAI-2 antigen for subsequent hybridoma screening2 and immunological studies. SDS-PAGE analysis of uPA incubated with PAI-2 in increasing molar ratios showed a corresponding increase in the relative amount of uPA·PAI-2 complex formed, reaching a maximum when the molar ratio of uPA to PAI-2 was 1:1 (Fig. 5 A). A strong relationship was observed between mAb 2H5 binding to uPA·PAI-2 complexes by ELISA and the amount of uPA·PAI-2 complex observed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Maximum binding of mAb 2H5 was observed when the molar ratio of uPA to PAI-2 was approximately 1:1 (Fig. 5 B). We hypothesized that the affinity of mAb 2H5 for the uPA·PAI-2 complex resulted from expression of neoepitopes on PAI-2 following conformational changes induced by interaction with target proteases. This implies that the epitope recognized by mAb 2H5 is not determined by sequences found on uPA. Fig. 6 A shows that mAb 2H5 bound at low titer to purified uPA·PAI-2 complex but not to either native recombinant (i.e. active, stressed) PAI-2 nor uPA. Although considered to be the principal in vivo inhibitor of uPA, PAI-2 is also a very efficient inhibitor of tPA (20Gettins P. Patston P.A. Schapira M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 C shows that mAb 2H5 also interacts at low titers with a mixture of tPA and PAI-2 but not with either tPA or PAI-2 protein alone. It was expected that the formation of a complex between PAI-2 and the 14-mer RSL peptide would mimic the interaction of PAI-2 with uPA by insertion of the RSL analogue into the β-sheet A of PAI-2, as previously observed with other serpins (6Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Bjork I. Ylinenjarvi K. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

Nordling K. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6501-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), hence inducing the relaxed conformation of the molecule. mAb 2H5 binding to PAI-2·14-mer RSL complexes was relatively high. In contrast, mAb 2H5 showed no interaction with either active recombinant PAI-2 or intact RSL peptide alone (Fig. 6 B). All synthetic RSL peptides lacking both the P13 (Glu) and P14 (Thr) residues failed to induce any detectable changes in the conformation of PAI-2 by ELISA (data not shown). Analysis of the peptide sequence of PAI-2 revealed the presence of a predicted thrombin cleavage site at the P1–P1′ bond (Arg380-Thr381). Fig. 6 C shows that treatment of PAI-2 with bovine thrombin for 1 h at 37 °C resulted in a significant increase in mAb 2H5 binding. Bovine thrombin alone did not interact with mAb 2H5. To further investigate the specificity of mAb 2H5 while conserving protein conformation, nondenaturing (native) PAGE immunoblotting analysis was used. The absence of reaction against native PAI-2 (Fig. 7 B) confirms that mAb 2H5 does not interact with active, stressed PAI-2. In contrast, mAb 2H5 reacts strongly with uPA·PAI-2 complexes (Fig. 7 B). Analysis of PAI-2·RSL complexes by native PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 7 A) showed the presence of several distinct protein bands, all of which were detectable by mAb 2H5 on Western blots (Fig. 6 B). Native PAGE and Western blotting analysis of uPA alone was not possible because the protein has a net positive charge at pH 8.2, making it unsuitable in the buffer system used; however, uPA applied directly to the membrane did not react with mAb 2H5 (data not shown). These data confirm that RSL insertion induces an immunologically distinct conformation of PAI-2, which is detectable by mAb 2H5. Understanding the mechanism of action of serpins is critical not only for understanding how this family of proteins functions but also to assist in the identification of cognate target proteases where the physiological activity of particular serpins is unknown. Additionally, the production of immunological probes capable of distinguishing the different serpin conformations may prove invaluable for identifying the temporal and spatial factors affecting serpin physiological function. Despite uncertainty over the precise nature of the serpin inhibitory mechanism, recent studies support the following model: (a) cleavage of the P1–P1′ bond and formation of a covalent acyl intermediate with the protease active site serine; (b) rapid insertion of the RSL into β-sheet A of the inhibitor, preventing deacylation by distorting the active site of the protease, hence trapping the molecules in a stable complex; and (c) associated conformational changes in the inhibitor resulting in transition to a more thermodynamically stable or relaxed state (3Gettins P.G.W.

BioEssays. 1993; 15: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that serpin action requires RSL insertion (6Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Bjork I. Ylinenjarvi K. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies used CD spectroscopy, activity assays, and thermal and chemical denaturation to show that insertion of synthetic RSL peptides induced the relaxed conformations of α1-antitrypsin and antithrombin III, respectively. The present study confirms and advances these works by focusing on the biomolecular interactions and conformational changes associated with the serpin activity of the putative plasminogen activator inhibitor, PAI-2. In summary, our data show induction of the relaxed conformation of PAI-2 by insertion of a synthetic RSL peptide by several methods. TUG-PAGE and fluorimetry showed that PAI-2·RSL complexes had greatly increased resistance to urea denaturation, indicating a significant increase in conformational stability of PAI-2 following peptide insertion. Insertion of synthetic RSL peptides or formation of serpin-protease complexes has previously been shown by several authors (21Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Enghild J.J. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20159-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to increase resistance to denaturation in urea. Additionally, a significant shift in the CD spectra of PAI-2 was observed following incubation with 14-mer RSL peptide. This shift was similar to that observed for formation of relaxed α1-antitrypsin by cleavage of the P1–P1′ bond (6Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and is further evidence of relaxed PAI-2 formation by insertion of RSL peptide. Investigation of the conditions required for PAI-2·RSL complex formation showed that resistance to urea denaturation increased as the molar ratio of RSL·PAI-2 present during incubation increased, approaching a maximum at a 100-fold molar excess of RSL. These data are in complete agreement with previous studies (6Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Bjork I. Ylinenjarvi K. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which found that similar excesses of RSL peptide were required to produce equimolar complexes. Together, these data indicate that the insertion of synthetic RSL peptide into native, stressed PAI-2 is kinetically unfavorable and may require partial unfolding of the molecule to overcome possible obstruction of the peptide binding site by the RSL of PAI-2. Formation of PAI-2·RSL complexes was accompanied by an almost complete loss of uPA inhibitory activity. However, uPA was still able to cleave the P1–P1′ bond of PAI-2 when complexed to RSL peptide, indicating the conversion of PAI-2 from an inhibitor to a substrate of uPA. The model outlined above predicts that inhibition of proteases by serpins results from distortion of the protease active site through conformational changes accompanying insertion of the RSL into β-sheet A, preventing deacylation. It is likely that the synthetic RSL peptide occupies a similar, if not identical, position in β-sheet A to that which the RSL of PAI-2 would occupy following stable complex formation with uPA or other proteases. Binding of the synthetic RSL peptide to this site may block insertion of the RSL of PAI-2 following cleavage at the P1–P1′ bond and prevent trapping of the protease in a stable complex, hence preventing inhibition. These data support analogous findings for antithrombin III (7Bjork I. Ylinenjarvi K. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and provide strong evidence that RSL insertion is a critical event in the inhibition of uPA, or other potential target proteases, by PAI-2. Examination of the molecular interactions involved in RSL insertion is essential for a complete understanding of the serpin inhibitory mechanism. Unlike the aforementioned studies on antithrombin III and α1-antitrypsin, this study employed a series of shortened RSL peptides to investigate the interactions required for RSL insertion in PAI-2. We did not observe the formation of relaxed PAI-2 by incubation with any RSL peptides lacking the P14 (Thr367) and P13 (Glu368) residues, indicating that either/both of these residues are critical for insertion of strand s4A into β-sheet A of PAI-2 during protease inhibition. Previous studies have suggested that the size and charge of the P14 residue (among others) may be critical in determining the favorability of RSL insertion and hence inhibitory activities of the different serpin molecules (23Stein P.E. Leslie A.G. Finch J.T. Turnell W.G. McLaughlin P.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1990; 347: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). For example, the noninhibitory serpin ovalbumin has a large, positively charged amino acid (arginine) at the P14 position, possibly preventing RSL insertion by unfavorable spatial and electrostatic interactions and hence preventing protease inhibition. Interestingly, our results indicate that P13 (Glu368) may also play a very important role in strand insertion. The negative charge of the glutamic acid may stabilize interactions between the RSL and β-sheet A and drive insertion of the remainder of the strand through electrostatic interactions. The amino acid residues on strands 3 and 5 of β-sheet A, predicted to be in close proximity to P13, are positively charged and may facilitate the insertion of the RSL into β-sheet A. Recent analysis of several inhibitory and noninhibitory serpins indicates that, along with P13, the P8 residue may also be critical for RSL insertion and protease inhibition. 3P. Curmi, personal communication. Crystallization of a serpin-protease complex should provide the necessary evidence to elucidate the precise nature of molecular interactions involved in RSL insertion during inhibition by serpins. The precise physiological roles of PAI-2 are somewhat controversial. Its expression by a wide variety of cells with invasive phenotypes suggests that it is a regulator of cell-mediated extracellular matrix degradation and tissue remodeling in processes as diverse as inflammation, skin differentiation, metastasis, and pregnancy (2Sumiyoshi K. Serizawa K. Urano T. Takada Y. Takada A. Baba S. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 50: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). More recently, intracellular PAI-2 has been implicated in protection from tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis (24Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20960-20964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jensen P.H. Cressey L.I. Gjertsen B.T. Madsen P. Mellgren G. Hokland P. Gliemann J. Doskeland S.O. Lanotte M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), although the mechanism responsible for this protection remains unknown. Previously, polyclonal antibodies had been used to detect relaxed antithrombin III and α1-antitrypsin (6Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Bjork I. Nordling K. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6501-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of using immunological methods to distinguish the different conformations of serpins. In order to better understand the biochemistry and physiology of PAI-2, we generated and characterized a monoclonal antibody (2H5) specifically detecting only the relaxed form of PAI-2. Future use of this probe may facilitate identification of potential target proteases and establish patterns of temporal and spatial expression of PAI-2 inhibitory activity in various physiological and pathological processes. Characterization of the epitope recognized by mAb 2H5 by ELISA and native PAGE immunoblotting showed that the epitope existed on uPA·PAI-2 complexes, tPA·PAI-2 complexes, PAI-2 treated with thrombin, and complexes of PAI-2 with 14-mer RSL peptide. The binding of mAb 2H5 to a crude reaction mixture of uPA and PAI-2 was found to increase as uPA was titrated with PAI-2. Increased binding corresponded with levels of uPA·PAI-2 complex formation, approaching a maximum at a 1:1 molar ratio of uPA to PAI-2, where maximal levels of uPA·PAI-2 complex were observed. mAb 2H5 did not recognize uPA, native stressed PAI-2, an RSL peptide, or thrombin alone. Together, these data indicate that mAb 2H5 recognizes neoepitopes on PAI-2 following the stressed to relaxed conformational transition associated with cleavage at the P1–P1′ bond and insertion of the reactive site loop into β-sheet A of the inhibitor. Analysis of various mutant serpins (5Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) suggests the presence of several functionally related antigenic mobile domains that may be involved in immunological recognition of relaxed serpins. These include the proximal and distal hinge regions, F helix, and β-sheets A and C. However, proteolytic or cyanogen bromide fragmentation of PAI-2 did not produce any mAb 2H5-reactive fragments (data not shown), suggesting that the epitope recognized by mAb 2H5 may be a conformational epitope rather than a single linear sequence. Further investigation of the mAb 2H5 epitope may assist in detailing the structural changes associated with protease inhibition by PAI-2 and lead to a better understanding of the inhibitory mechanism of serpins in general. This study describes for the first time the generation and characterization of relaxed PAI-2 by insertion of a synthetic RSL peptide, mimicking the conformation of PAI-2 induced by inhibition of its target protease uPA. The generation of a monoclonal antibody to specifically detect this conformation of PAI-2 provides an immunological probe for precise localization of in vivosites (i.e. skin, placenta, tumors) in which PAI-2 is actively inhibiting uPA or other target proteases and may lead to a better understanding of the physiological and/or pathological roles of this molecule. For example, mAb 2H5 has recently been used to show differential expression of relaxed PAI-2 in human gestational tissues (27Tsatas D. Baker M.S. Rice G.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1593-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), leading to a better understanding of the role of the plasminogen activation cascade in pregnancy.

It is well documented that p53 has the ability to inhibit transcription driven by several promoters, possibly via distinct mechanisms. In this report, we show that expression of the cell cycle regulatory transcription factor DP1 is strongly inhibited by p53, at the level of transcription and probably through the basal TATA-less promoter. This inhibitory activity has a relative specificity for the DP1 promoter compared with the functionally related E2F1 promoter or unrelated promoters such as those of the transcription factor ATFa or the thymidine kinase gene.

Inhibition of DP1 transcription has implications in one of the several possible mechanisms through which p53 induces cell cycle arrest. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is generally expressed at low levels in normal cells. Up-regulation of p53 has diverse effects on the expression of a variety of genes and the activity of their encoded proteins, cumulating in growth arrest and/or activation of the apoptotic pathway (see Refs. 1Levine A.J.

The p53 protein is a genuine transcription factor and can directly activate a subset of genes important for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, through binding to specific sequences located within the promoter regions or the first introns of these genes (4el-Deiry W.S.

However, it has also been reported that p53 can repress the transcription of a large number of genes, which do not have consensus p53 binding sequences within their regulatory regions (6Ginsberg D. Mechta F. Yaniv M. Oren M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9979-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism underlying this p53-dependent inhibition is presently unclear, but it is thought to be the consequence of p53 inhibiting transcription activators (7Perrem K. Rayner J. Voss T.

This phenomenon, which seemed to be specific for genes with “TATA box” elements, has recently also been demonstrated in promoters without a TATA consensus (12Sandri M.I. Isaacs R.J. Ongkeko W.M.

The E2F/DP family of transcription factors plays a key role in transducing proliferative signals through regulating the expression of genes whose products are involved in DNA synthesis and cell cycle control. E2F/DP significantly contributes to the transcriptional control of cell cycle regulators such as the cyclins A, D, and E, E2F1, E2F2, and c-Myc (15Farnham P.J. Slansky J.E. Kollmar R. Biochim.

Consequently, E2F/DP functions as a crucial cellular regulator of the G1 to S phase checkpoint, and dysregulated expression of E2F/DP activity is likely to have a drastic effect on the cell and the organism (reviewed in Ref. 18Weinberg R.A.

E2F/DP is a heterodimeric transcription factor comprising two families of proteins, the E2Fs (E2F1–5) and DPs (DP1–3) (16Lam E.W.F. La Thangue N.B. Curr. Opin.

The E2F and DP proteins cooperate to bind DNA and activate transcription of target genes. E2F1 and DP1 were the first members of this transcription factor to be cloned and are probably the best characterized (19Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. De Caprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S.

Several aspects of the DP1 protein have been documented, including its functional domains and its proto-oncogenic potential (16Lam E.W.F. La Thangue N.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 22Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 23Helin K. Wu C.L. Fattaey A.R.

Mattei M.G. Lathangue N.B. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2671-2680PubMed Google Scholar). DP1 is a phosphoprotein, and its activity is believed to be regulated through phosphorylation during the cell cycle (25Bandara L.R. Lam E.W. Sorensen T.S. Zamanian M. Girling R. La Thangue N.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3104-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). One of the kinases involved in phosphorylating DP1 is the cyclin A·cdk2 complex, which phosphorylates DP1 at the end of S phase (26Lees E. Faha B. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1874-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar,27Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S. Arany Z. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 161-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This results in reduction in DNA binding activity of the E2F1/DP1 heterodimer and down-regulation of target genes at later stages of the cell cycle. The interaction of the tumor suppressor pocket protein family pRB, p107, and p130 with E2F/DP forms the basis of the mechanism by which E2F/DP activity is regulated, during early phases of the cell cycle (28Whyte P. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Evidence has now emerged that there is cross-talk between the p53 and pRB/E2F pathways and that p53 also has a role in modulating E2F/DP activity. This regulation occurs via direct protein interactions between p53 and components of the E2F1/DP1 heterodimer, resulting in cross-inhibition of p53 and E2F/DP transcription activity (8O'Connor D.J. Lam E.W. Griffin S. Zhong S. Leighton L.C. Burbidge S.A. Lu X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6184-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Additional level of cross-talk, but in a less direct manner, has been also shown to be mediated by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 (29Good L. Dimri G.P. Campisi J. Chen K.Y. J. Cell.

In the present report, we provide evidence for yet another level of control exerted by p53 on E2F/DP activity, through transcriptional repression of the DP1 promoter and to a lesser extent that of the E2F1 promoter.

Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst .). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), generating the following recombinants: mDP1p-CAT contains the wild-type mouse DP1 promoter (mDP1p, between positions −1142 and +170) (Fig. 1 (24Gopalkrishnan R.V. Dolle P. Mattei M.G. Lathangue N.B. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2671-2680PubMed Google Scholar)); mDP1pmut1-CAT contains the same mDP1 sequences but with point mutations (CACGTG → CAAATG, at positions −1027 and −1026) that destroy the putative Myc binding site and a deletion of 88 base pairs (between positions −850 to −763) that removes the putative E2F binding site (between −842 to −834) and flanking sequences; mDP1pmut2-CAT contains mDP1p sequences identical to the wild type, except for point mutations that destroy the putative Myc binding site (24Gopalkrishnan R.V. Dolle P. Mattei M.G. Lathangue N.B. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2671-2680PubMed Google Scholar); mE2F1p-CAT contains the −176 to +98 region of the mouse E2F1 promoter (32Hsiao K.M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar); hATFa-CAT contains the −1917/+83 region of the human ATFa promoter (33Goetz J. Chatton B. Mattei M.G.

Overexpression of wild-type p53 (p53WT) and mutants R273H and R175H were from the eukaryotic expression vectors described in Hinds et al. (34Hinds P.W. Finlay C.A. Quartin R.S. Baker S.J. Fearon E.R. Vogelstein B. Levine A.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 571-580PubMed Google Scholar). These p53 mutants, which were derived from human colorectal carcinomas, are altered at residues Arg-175 and Arg-273, respectively. Each mutation inactivates the DNA binding domain, thus disrupting the p53 ability to recognize and bind DNA site- specifically. The p53 mutant 22,23, which carries a double mutation at residues Leu-22 and Trp-23, was originally described by Lin et al. (35Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and shown to be defective for transactivation.

Transfections and CAT assays were performed in Saos-2 cells using calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described previously (24Gopalkrishnan R.V. Dolle P. Mattei M.G. Lathangue N.B. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2671-2680PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitations of CAT chromatograms were performed on a PhosphorImager (Fuji Photo Film Co.). Fold inhibition values were expressed as ratios of the activity of the reporter in the presence of the empty vector to that in the presence of the p53 expression vectors. Each data point represents an average of at least three independent experiments, with standard deviations. The intrinsic transcriptional activity of transfected wild-type and mutant p53 constructs was performed using 1 μg each of pG13CAT (a reporter bearing 13 copies of a p53 binding site) (38Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) and the expression construct, respectively. Protein extracts (39Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), prepared from Saos-2 cells transfected with p53 expression constructs, were analyzed by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were Western blotted and probed with the anti-p53 CM5 antibody or the monoclonal antibodies DO-1 and pAb240 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) which recognize distinct epitopes on p53. The specific signals were detected using chemiluminescence detection systems (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and DuPont). NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, clone 6 rat embryo fibroblasts (9Ragimov N. Krauskopf A. Navot N. Rotter V. Oren M. Aloni Y. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1183-1193PubMed Google Scholar, 40Martinez J. Georgoff I. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), and Saos-2 (p53−/−) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After removal of the culture medium from subconfluent NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, the cells were exposed to a 50 J/m2 dose of UV radiation delivered by a XL-1500 UV cross-linker (Spectronics Corp.). The original culture medium was then returned to the irradiated cells for further incubation before harvest at time points indicated. The clone 6 rat embryo fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C. In the temperature shift experiments, subconfluent clone 6 cells were transferred to 32.5 °C. Cells were then harvested at indicated times. Twenty μg of total RNA extracted at times indicated was resolved by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by Northern blotting as described (41Lam E.W. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). DP1 mRNA was detected by hybridization with a full-length32P-labeled cDNA probe. The control GAPDH cDNA probe has been described previously (41Lam E.W. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The cloning of the mouse DP1 genomic locus and preliminary characterization of the promoter sequences have been reported earlier (24Gopalkrishnan R.V. Dolle P. Mattei M.G. Lathangue N.B. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2671-2680PubMed Google Scholar). We presently report the sequence of major upstream regulatory elements (Fig. 1) which, when linked to a luciferase reporter gene and stably expressed in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts, mimics the induction kinetics of the endogenous gene. 3R. V. Gopalkrishnan, E. W.-F. Lam, and C. Kedinger, unpublished observation. To gain further insight into the mechanisms involved in this regulation, experiments were undertaken to determine the nature of modulatory signals for both the endogenous gene and transfected constructs. Exponentially growing NIH 3T3 cells were exposed to UV radiation (50 J/m2), and the steady-state levels of DP1 RNA were monitored by Northern blot analysis, over a period of 16 h. The protein level of p53 was also followed by Western analysis over the same time course. An inverse relationship between p53 protein level and DP1 mRNA level was observed, whereas p53 accumulated following UV treatment (Fig. 2 A), DP1 expression was progressively reduced, compared with the level of GAPDH transcripts that remained unaffected (Fig. 2 B). Because UV radiation is an inducer of p53 expression (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 42Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar), these results provided strong circumstantial evidence for the involvement of p53 in DP1 regulation. To rule out the possibility that the observed modulation of DP1 expression was due to side effects of UV irradiation, unrelated to p53 induction, we examined the pattern of DP1 transcripts under more defined conditions. Rat embryo fibroblasts (clone 6) harboring a temperature-sensitive allele of p53 (9Ragimov N. Krauskopf A. Navot N. Rotter V. Oren M. Aloni Y. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1183-1193PubMed Google Scholar, 40Martinez J. Georgoff I. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) were shifted to the permissive temperature, where the p53 protein is expressed in the wild-type active conformation. As shown in Fig. 3 A, this induced a rapid down-regulation of DP1 RNA levels, within an hour after shift to the permissive temperature. Normalization of DP1 mRNA levels as a ratio to GAPDH (Fig. 3 B) showed that there was an average 4–5-fold decrease in DP1 mRNA levels, after wild-type p53 induction had occurred. Furthermore, we verified that a similar temperature shift had no effect on DP1 expression in wild-type rat embryo fibroblasts (not shown). It therefore appeared that accumulation of active wild-type p53 was capable of down-regulating the steady-state levels of endogenous DP1 mRNA in vivo. To examine the effect of p53 on DP1 promoter activity in a more direct way, transient transfection experiments were performed in p53-negative Saos-2 cells, using a DP1 reporter construct (mDP1p-CAT) and assaying its activity in the absence or presence of a p53 expression vector (Table I). In accordance with the observations above, expression of p53 resulted in a marked inhibition of the DP1 promoter, as revealed by the decrease in reporter activity. A maximal level of about 10-fold inhibition was observed with 0.5 μg of reporter construct. Reduction in levels of inhibition was observed with increasing amounts of DP1 reporter DNA and constant amount of p53 expression construct, suggesting that the assay system was responsive to the amount of p53 in the cell; excess of DP1 promoter sequences partially overcame inhibition, probably when p53 levels became limiting.Table Ip53 inhibits the mDP1 promoter activitymDP1p-CAT reporterRelative CAT activityFold inhibition by p53−p53+p53μg-fold0.51929.51.03984.92.056163.54.088224.0 Open table in a new tab To determine whether inhibition of the mDP1 promoter was specifically achieved by the wild-type but not mutant p53 protein, as suggested in the temperature-sensitive mutant experiments (Fig. 3), transient transfection experiments were performed in Saos-2 cells with identical amounts of expression construct encoding either the wild-type or distinct mutant forms of p53 (see “Materials and Methods”). Only wild-type p53 had a significant ability to inhibit the activity of the mDP1 promoter (Fig. 4 A). The extent of inhibition was, on an average, 7-fold compared with the activity of the mDP1 promoter cotransfected with an equivalent amount of unloaded vector or mutant constructs, under identical assay conditions. To examine whether the different p53 expression constructs used in transfection assays expressed equivalent levels of proteins, extracts were made from appropriately transfected cells and analyzed by Western blotting, using two monoclonal antibodies recognizing distinct epitopes on the p53 molecule (Fig. 4 B, top). Except for the negative control (Saos-2 cells transfected with empty vector), all four p53 constructs expressed the corresponding proteins to approximately equivalent levels under the conditions used. Furthermore, the different transfected p53 proteins displayed their expected capacity for transcriptional activation; as previously reported (Ref. 1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar and references therein), only the wild type and to a much lesser extent the 22,23 mutant (35Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) showed biological activity based on the ability to drive expression of a cat reporter gene placed downstream of a synthetic reporter containing multiple p53 binding sites (Fig. 4 B, bottom). Under our experimental conditions, no significant levels of cell death were observed between cells that expressed wild-type p53 and those expressing mutant constructs (data not shown). Also, cells expressing wild-type p53 protein were not compromised in general transcriptional functions, since other promoters transfected in parallel exhibited comparable activity either in the presence or absence of p53 (see below). Altogether, these observations strongly supported the conclusion that inhibition of the DP1 promoter was specifically exhibited only by the wild-type, functional p53 protein and not by the mutant forms. These results were also indicative of the fact that nonspecific inhibition or “squelching” of transcription by titration effects due to excess, exogenously introduced DNA or p53 protein expression was not the likely cause of this repression. The p53 protein has been previously reported to inhibit a number of promoters (7Perrem K. Rayner J. Voss T. Sturzbecher H. Jackson P. Braithwaite A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1299-1307PubMed Google Scholar, 8O'Connor D.J. Lam E.W. Griffin S. Zhong S. Leighton L.C. Burbidge S.A. Lu X.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4281-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that do not contain specific p53 binding sites. To determine the specificity of inhibition, a series of transfection assays were performed using mE2F1p-, hATFap-, and the HSV-tkminp-CAT constructs (see “Materials and Methods”), in parallel with the mDP1p-CAT reporter. All four promoter constructs had identical pBLCAT6 reporter backbones. Although the basal activities of these constructs were intrinsically different, their relative levels of inhibition by p53 (Fig. 5 A) were quite distinct; it appeared that the mDP1 promoter was most susceptible to inhibition by p53, followed by the mE2F1 promoter; the other two promoters were repressed to a much lesser extent. It is probably more than coincidental that the DP1 and E2F1 promoters were most sensitive to inhibition by p53, since both promoters exhibit temporally overlapping activities during the cell cycle and because both DP1 and E2F products participate in cell cycle regulation. Additionally, both genes most likely share regulatory elements (32Hsiao K.M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar)3 that are not in common to the other two promoters. To determine the mechanism by which p53 exerted its inhibitory effects on the mDP1 promoter, transfection experiments were performed using the wild-type mDP1p-CAT and two mutated mDP1 constructs as follows: mDP1mut1-CAT, mutated in the putative Myc binding site and lacking a putative enhancer element, centered around an E2F binding site and mDP1mut2-CAT point-mutated in only the putative Myc binding site (see “Materials and Methods”). Although mDP1mut2 had activity comparable to that of the wild-type promoter, the mDP1mut1 construct had approximately 3–5-fold reduced basal activity (data not shown). Despite this difference in basal activities, both mutated promoters exhibited similar fold inhibition by p53 (Fig. 5 B). This indicated that, although the mDP1mut1 construct was lacking in a putative enhancer region (24Gopalkrishnan R.V. Dolle P. Mattei M.G. Lathangue N.B. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2671-2680PubMed Google Scholar)3 that encompassed sequences important for mDP1 promoter activity, it was still inhibited by p53. Thus p53 does not apparently mediate its major inhibitory effects at the level of this putative enhancer element, since deletion of those sequences, while reducing overall promoter activity, actually resulted in a greater inhibitory response to p53 (Fig. 5 B). To approach this question from another angle, E2F1, DP1, and Sp1 proteins, all of which possess putative binding sites in the mDP1 promoter (24Gopalkrishnan R.V. Dolle P. Mattei M.G. Lathangue N.B. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2671-2680PubMed Google Scholar) and have the reported capacity to interact with p53 (7Perrem K. Rayner J. Voss T. Sturzbecher H. Jackson P. Braithwaite A.

Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), were unable to reverse inhibition (data not shown). Such experiments were technically difficult to perform, in terms of obtaining an optimal balance of several different overexpressed factors under the regulation of different promoters. In general, however, in every case where activation of the reporter was obtained by overexpression of an exogenous factor, the extent of p53 inhibition was still in the range of 5–7-fold, similar to when these factors were not exogenously expressed. It seems likely, therefore, that p53-mediated inhibition of the DP1 promoter does not occur at the level of enhancer sequences nor mediated through interactions with enhancer-binding proteins. A possible mechanism of p53-mediated inhibition, reported for several TATA box containing promoters, has been attributed to its ability to interact with diverse components of the basal transcription machinery. A majority of such studies has demonstrated the ability of components of the basal machinery such as TBP (9Ragimov N. Krauskopf A. Navot N. Rotter V. Oren M. Aloni Y.

When the 6 amino acids located in positions 159–164 in AGT were replaced by the equivalent sequence from the Escherichia coli Ada-C protein (mutant AGT/6ada) the preference for benzyl repair was eliminated. Further mutation incorporating the P140A change into AGT/6ada giving mutant P140A/6ada led to a protein that resembled Ada-C in preference for the repair of methyl groups, but P140A/6ada did not differ from P140A in reaction with the free base O 6-benzylguanine. Changes in the AGT active site pocket can therefore affect the preference for repair of O 6-benzyl or -methyl groups when present in an oligodeoxyribonucleotide without altering the reaction with free O 6-benzylguanine.

When the 6 amino acids located in positions 159–164 in AGT were replaced by the equivalent sequence from the Escherichia coli Ada-C protein (mutant AGT/6ada) the preference for benzyl repair was eliminated. Further mutation incorporating the P140A change into AGT/6ada giving mutant P140A/6ada led to a protein that resembled Ada-C in preference for the repair of methyl groups, but P140A/6ada did not differ from P140A in reaction with the free base O 6-benzylguanine. Changes in the AGT active site pocket can therefore affect the preference for repair of O 6-benzyl or -methyl groups when present in an oligodeoxyribonucleotide without altering the reaction with free O 6-benzylguanine. The human DNA repair protein,O 6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), 1The abbreviations used are: AGT, humanO 6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase; Ada-C, the carboxyl-terminal domain of the E. coli O 6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase; ss, single-stranded; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. is well known to react very rapidly with double-stranded DNA substrates containingO 6-methylguanine residues. AGT brings about the transfer of a methyl group from the O 6-position of methylated guanines onto a cysteine acceptor located in a PCHR site in the protein sequence (1Lindahl T. Sedgwick B.

Biol. 1995; 51: 167-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The S-methylcysteine generated in this reaction is not converted back to cysteine and the protein can therefore act only once. The human AGT is very readily inactivated by exposure to the free base,O 6-benzylguanine (5Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Pegg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5368-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). This inactivation is caused by the ability of O 6-benzylguanine to serve as a low molecular weight substrate for the protein forming guanine and an S-benzylcysteine at the active site cysteine-145 residue (6Pegg A.E.

O 6-Benzylguanine has proven useful as a reagent to examine the importance of AGT activity in protection against the toxic effects of methylating and chloroethylating agents (4Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 167-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that treatment of tumor cells in culture and of tumors grown as xenografts in nude mice withO 6-benzylguanine to inactivate AGT greatly enhances the killing by both methylating and chloroethylating agents (4Pegg A.E.

Clinical trials testing the effectiveness ofO 6-benzylguanine to enhance cancer chemotherapy are in progress (9Dolan M.E. Pegg A.E. Clin.

The development of resistance to anticancer agents is a major problem in cancer chemotherapy, and the possibility that the generation/selection of mutant forms of AGT resistant toO 6-benzylguanine may occur during clinical use is of major importance. Although no such resistance has yet been seen in patients treated with the drug, laboratory studies suggest that AGT variants with reduced activity towardO 6-benzylguanine can readily be produced. The first suggestion that this may be the case was provided by the observation that the Escherichia coli protein Ada-C was totally refractory to inhibition byO 6-benzylguanine (13Dolan M.E. Pegg A.E. Dumenco L.L. Moschel R.C. Gerson S.L. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 2305-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that the yeast AGT and the E. coli Ogt alkyltransferases were also insensitive to O 6-benzylguanine (6Pegg A.E. Boosalis M. Samson L. Moschel R.C. Byers T.L. Swenn K. Dolan M.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11998-12006Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,14Elder R.H. Margison G.P. Rafferty J.A. Biochem.

Production of site-directed mutants in the human AGT based on the comparison of these sequences (15Crone T.M. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4750-4753PubMed Google Scholar, 16Crone T.M. Goodtzova K.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2007-2012PubMed Google Scholar) showed that several mutations causing single amino acid changes in the AGT were able to greatly reduce the sensitivity to inactivation by O 6-benzylguanine. It appears that resistance can be brought about by two types of alteration of the active site pocket: a steric effect reducing the size of the space available at the active site and thus preventing the bulkyO 6-benzylguanine from binding (16Crone T.M. Goodtzova K. Edara S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6221-6227PubMed Google Scholar, 19Crone T.M. Kanugula S. Pegg A.E. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 1687-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); or the insertion of a hydrophilic residue into the active site, which discourages the binding of the hydrophobicO 6-benzylguanine (17Edara S. Kanugula S. Goodtzova K. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5571-5575PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we have compared the ability of the AGT and some mutants to react with O 6-benzylguanine when presented either as a free base or when incorporated into a ss oligodeoxyribonucleotide. Several point mutations greatly reducing the ability to react with the free base did not prevent the rapid repair ofO 6-benzylguanine when it was incorporated into a 16-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide. These mutations also did not alter the preference of AGT for the repair of benzyl groups rather than methyl groups when incubated with a mixture of 16-mers containing bothO 6-benzylguanine andO 6-methylguanine. Only when multiple alterations conforming to residues present in Ada-C were incorporated was the preference for benzyl repair eliminated. These results provide further insight into the alkyltransferase reaction and into the design of therapeutically useful inactivators. Relatively short oligodeoxyribonucleotides containingO 6-benzylguanine were very effective inhibitors of both the wild type and the mutant AGTs. Therefore, such compounds may form the basis for the design of clinically useful AGT inhibitors that would not be so easily circumvented by single amino acid changes at the active site. The synthesis ofO 6-benzylguanine (5Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Pegg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5368-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and the 16-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides containingO 6-benzylguanine orO 6-methylguanine were described previously (20Pauly G.T. Hughes S.H. Moschel R.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11700-11706Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These oligodeoxyribonucleotides were repurified by HPLC (21Pauly G.T. Powers M. Pei G.K. Moschel R.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1988; 1: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The additional oligodeoxyribonucleotides used here were synthesized using methods described previously (21Pauly G.T. Powers M. Pei G.K. Moschel R.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1988; 1: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and were characterized by enzymatic digestion to 2′-deoxyribonucleosides. This analysis agreed within ±10% of the expected values for these oligodeoxyribonucleotides, which were 5′-d(Ab6GC)-3′, 5′-d(GAb6GCT)-3′, 5′-d(TGAb6GCTG)-3′, 5′-d(GTGAb6GCTGT)-3′, 5′-d(TGTGAb6GCTGTG)-3′ where b6G =O 6-benzylguanine. The respective molar extinction coefficients for these oligodeoxyribonucleotides were 2.6, 4.26, 6.16, 7.48, and 9.1 (all × 10−4), respectively. Labeled O 6-benzyl[8-3H]guanine (0.34 mCi/mmol) was prepared by catalytic tritium exchange ofO 6-benzylguanine with tritiated water by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and was purified by HPLC (6Pegg A.E.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11998-12006Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).N-[3H] Methyl-N-nitrosourea (5.9 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Amersham. All non-alkylated oligodeoxyribonucleotides were made in the Macromolecular Core Facility, Hershey Medical Center, by using a Milligen 7500 DNA synthesizer. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Ampicillin, kanamycin, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid pGEM-3Zf(+) and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI). PfuDNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). AGT, P140A, G156A, and AGT/6ada were prepared using the pIN vector expression system. The construction of pIN-AGT, pIN-P140A, and pIN-G156A has been described (15Crone T.M. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4750-4753PubMed Google Scholar, 16Crone T.M. Goodtzova K. Edara S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6221-6227PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Friedman H.S. Moschel R.C. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1993; 34: 565Google Scholar). The pIN-AGT/6ada was made by annealing two complementary oligodeoxynucleotides of 80 and 87 base pairs that have the codons for the 6 amino acid sequence from Ada-C (-Arg-Trp-Gly-Val-Ser-Arg-) in place of the codons coding for (-Ser-Gly-Gly-Leu-Ala-Val-) in AGT. These oligodeoxyribonucleotides had the sequences: 5′-GTGGTCTGCAGCAGCGGAGCCGTGGGCAACTACCGCTGGGGCGTGTCGCGTAAGGAATGGCTTCTGGCCCATGAAGGCCA-3′ and 3′-TCTCACCAGACGTCGTCGCCTCGGCACCCGTTGATGGCGACCCCGCACAGCGCATTCCTTACCGAAGACCGGGTACTTCCGGTGGCC-5′ where the bases that are not identical to the AGT sequence are shown in bold typeface. When annealed, the resulting double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide has protruding ends, which facilitates its ligation into pGEMAGT (16Crone T.M. Goodtzova K. Edara S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6221-6227PubMed Google Scholar) cut with DraIII andAgeI. The colonies were screened by digestion withNheI since the NheI site is removed for the human AGT sequence by introduction of the altered sequence amino acids from Ada-C protein. The plasmid containing the altered sequence (pGEMAGT/6ada) was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and the 621-base pair fragment ligated into pIN vector cut with these enzymes to form pIN-AGT/6ada as described for pINAGT (22Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Friedman H.S. Moschel R.C. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1993; 34: 565Google Scholar). The AGT, Ada-C, and P140A/6ada were produced using the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) for the expression of the protein with a small extension (Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-(His)6-Gly-Ser-) at the amino terminus. Construction of the pQE30-AGT (17Edara S. Kanugula S. Goodtzova K. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5571-5575PubMed Google Scholar) and pQE30-Ada-C (23Goodtzova K. Kanugula S. Edara S. Pauly G.T. Moschel R.C. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8332-8339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) has been described previously. The pQE30-P140A plasmid was constructed by inserting an EcoNI to DraIII fragment isolated from pGEM-P140A (15Crone T.M. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4750-4753PubMed Google Scholar) into pQE30-AGT cut with the same enzymes. The pQE30-P140A/6ada plasmid was constructed by inserting theDraIII to AgeI fragment from pINAGT/6ada into pQE30-P140A cut with the same enzymes. All plasmids were verified by sequencing of the entire AGT coding region. AGT proteins expressed from the pIN vector were purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography on Mono-S, and gel filtration as described previously (6Pegg A.E. Boosalis M. Samson L. Moschel R.C. Byers T.L. Swenn K. Dolan M.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11998-12006Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Kanugula S. Goodtzova K. Edara S. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7113-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AGT proteins expressed from the pQE30 system were purified using Talon IMAC resin eluted with imidazole as described (17Edara S. Kanugula S. Goodtzova K. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5571-5575PubMed Google Scholar). All proteins used were at least 90% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified AGT or mutant proteins were incubated with the potential inhibitor in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5.0 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg of hemocyanin or 10 μg of calf thymus DNA for 30 min at 37 °C. The residual alkyltransferase activity was then determined by a 30-min incubation period with a3H-methylated DNA substrate, which had been methylated by reaction withN-[3H]methyl-N-nitrosourea essentially as described (5Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Pegg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5368-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 25Dolan M.E. Mitchell R.B. Mummert C. Moschel R.C. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3367-3372PubMed Google Scholar). The volume was increased to 1.0 ml during the second incubation. The results were expressed as the percentage of the AGT activity remaining and then used to calculate the ED50 value for the inhibitor where the ED50 is the concentration needed to reduce the AGT activity by 50% in a 30-min incubation period at 37 °C. There was no significant loss (<5%) of AGT activity when no inhibitor was added. The concentrations of the oligodeoxyribonucleotides containingO 6-benzylguanine were determined using the extinction coefficients at 260 nm. Measurements of [8-3H]guanine formation fromO 6-benzyl[8-3H]guanine were carried out using an assay mixture consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mmdithiothreitol in a volume of 0.25 ml. After incubation for periods of up to 60 min, the formation of [8-3H]guanine was determined by HPLC (26Goodtzova K. Crone T. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8385-8390Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Results were expressed as cpm of [8-3H]guanine formed per μg of protein per min. The purified alkyltransferase proteins were incubated in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0. 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA with 5′-d(AACAGCCATATa6GGCCC)-3′ where a6G represents O 6-benzylguanine orO 6-methylguanine. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1% SDS, and the mixture of oligodeoxyribonucleotides was separated by HPLC. The separation was carried out on a Beckman C18 5-μm Ultrasphere ODS reverse-phase column (4.6 × 250 mm) with a Brownlee RP-300 Aquapore 7-μm precolumn (0.46 × 300 mm) at 45 °C using a flow rate of 2 ml/min and a linear gradient of increasing methanol at 0.23% per min over 30 min starting from 14% methanol in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.3. The retention times of the unalkylated, methylated and benzylated oligodeoxyribonucleotides that were detected by absorbance at 254 nm were 9.5, 15, and 21 min, respectively. Previous studies have identified a number of single amino acid mutations in the human AGT sequence that impart resistance to O 6-benzylguanine. These include the alterations of Pro138 or Pro140 to Ala or Lys (15Crone T.M. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4750-4753PubMed Google Scholar, 16Crone T.M. Goodtzova K. Edara S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6221-6227PubMed Google Scholar) and the alteration of Gly156 to Ala or Trp (16Crone T.M. Goodtzova K. Edara S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6221-6227PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the E. coli Ada-C protein is totally resistant to O 6-benzylguanine but can be rendered sensitive by placing a Pro residue in place of Ala at position 316 (which is equivalent to 140 in AGT) and by converting a bulky Trp336 residue, which blocks access to the active site, to Ala (23Goodtzova K.

Demple B. Moody P.C.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These residues are underlined in Fig. 1, which also shows the sequence of the AGT mutant proteins used in the experiments described here. These findings support the concept that a Pro residue at position 140 is needed for O 6-benzylguanine to react well with the AGT. However, the presence of a Trp residue in the active site region of the AGT at the position presumably equivalent to Trp336 was not sufficient to prevent good reaction withO 6-benzylguanine since the mutant AGT/6ada was not markedly resistant to inactivation byO 6-benzylguanine (TableI) and produced almost the same amount of [8-3H]guanine when allowed to react withO 6-benzyl[8-3H]guanine as the wild type AGT (Table I). The AGT/6ada protein has 6 amino acids located in positions 159–164 replaced by the equivalent sequence from Ada-C, which includes Trp336 (Fig. 1). Moreover, when the P140A mutation was combined with AGT/6ada mutation to form P140A/6ada, the resistance to O 6-benzylguanine inactivation and the rate of [8-3H]guanine production was not significantly different from that of the P140A alone (Table I).Table IInactivation of alkyltransferase activity by O 6 -benzylguanine and production of guanine from O 6 -benzylguanine by alkyltransferasesAlkyltransferaseED50 for alkyltransferase inactivation by O 6-benzylguanineGuanine production from O 6-benzylguanine1-aResults shown are the mean ± S.D. or the mean for three separate estimations.Assayed − DNAAssayed + DNAμmcpm/ng proteinAGT0.22.5 ± 0.48.4 ± 0.6P140A5.01-bData previously published (15, 16).0.131.1AGT/6ada0.42.3 ± 0.26.8P140A/6ada4.00.140.7G156A60.01-bData previously published (15, 16).0.020.021-a Results shown are the mean ± S.D. or the mean for three separate estimations.1-1002 Data previously published (15Crone T.M.

Open table in a new tab As indicated in Table I, the P140A, G156A, and P140A/6ada AGT mutant proteins were much less able to react withO 6-benzylguanine as a free base as demonstrated by the rate of [8-3H]guanine formation fromO 6-benzyl[8-3H]guanine. However, it is known that the rate of alkyl group transfer by AGT or Ada-C is enhanced by binding DNA, which causes a conformational change in the protein exposing and activating the cysteine at the alkyl acceptor site (26Goodtzova K. Crone T. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8385-8390Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Moore M.H. Gulbus J.M. Dodson E.J. Demple B. Moody P.C.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In our studies, the presence of calf thymus DNA increased the rate of [8-3H]guanine formation with all of the mutants and had a larger effect on those containing a mutation at Pro140, but even in the presence of DNA, the P140A and G156A mutations greatly reduced the rate of the AGT reaction withO 6-benzylguanine (Table I). All of these mutant proteins were able to react very rapidly withO 6-benzylguanine when it was incorporated into a 16-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide with reaction being complete with less than 5 min (results not shown). In agreement with previous reports (23Goodtzova K. Kanugula S. Edara S. Pauly G.T. Moschel R.C. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8332-8339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), when the wild type AGT was incubated with an equimolar mixture of 16-mers of identical sequence containing either O 6-benzylguanine orO 6-methylguanine, the AGT slightly preferred the benzylated substrate (Fig. 2). This preference was also the case with both the G156A and the P140A mutant AGT proteins (Fig. 2). However, the substitution of the positions 159–164 with the 6 amino acids from Ada (mutant AGT/6ada) led to a slight preference for the methylated 16-mer, and when this alteration was combined with the P140A substitution (mutant P140A/6ada), this led to a marked preference for repair of the methylated substrate (Fig. 2). The P140A/6ada mutant AGT therefore resembled Ada-C, which as previously reported (23Goodtzova K. Kanugula S. Edara S. Pauly G.T. Moschel R.C. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8332-8339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) strongly prefers the methylated substrate. Incubation of control, P140A, or G156A AGT with oligodeoxyribonucleotides containingO 6-benzylguanine led to a loss of AGT activity (Fig. 3 and TableII). All of the oligodeoxyribonucleotides tested were more potent than O 6-benzylguanine itself or O 6-benzyl-2′-deoxyguanosine (which we have previously shown to actually be less active than the free base (28Moschel R.C. Hudgins W.R. Dipple A. J. Org. Chem. 1986; 51: 4180-4186Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). Even a 3-mer was more active than the free base but maximal effects were seen with oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5–9 nucleotides. It should be noted that although the reduction in the ED50 value for the mutants was much greater than for the wild type (by a factor of >1000 for G156A and by a factor of 60–100 for P140A compared with a factor of 15–30 for control AGT), there was still a 4–11-fold difference in the ED50 values between the mutant AGT proteins and the control AGT.Table IIInactivation of AGTs by reaction with O 6 -benzylguanine, O 6 -benzyl-2′-deoxyguanosine or oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing O 6 -benzylguanineOligodeoxyribonucleotideED50 for inactivation of AGTAGTG156AP140AnmO 6-Benzylguanine2-aData previously published (15, 16)20060,0005,000O 6-Benzyl-2′-deoxyguanosine2-bData previously published (40)2000>100,000>20,0005′-Ab6GC-3′2-cFrom experiments illustrated in Fig. 39046007705′-GAb6GCT-3′2-cFrom experiments illustrated in Fig. 31360505′-TGAb6GCTG-3′2-cFrom experiments illustrated in Fig. 3750605′-GTGAb6GCTGT-3′2-cFrom experiments illustrated in Fig. 3890605′-TGTGAb6GCTGTG-3′2-cFrom experiments illustrated in Fig. 313110752-a Data previously published (15Crone T.M.

Chem. 1992; 35: 4486-4491Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar)2-c From experiments illustrated in Fig. 3 Open table in a new tab We have demonstrated previously that when presented with a mixture of ss oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates, the human AGT repairsO 6-benzylguanine preferentially overO 6-methylguanine, whereas the E. coliAda-C alkyltransferase exhibits a strong preference to act onO 6-methylguanine (23Goodtzova K.

The results presented here show that this preference is primarily due to the amino acids at positions between the conserved residues, Tyr-158 and Lys-165. Replacing the human sequence at this region with the sequence from Ada-C abolished the preference for benzyl repair (Fig. 2). A secondary contributor to the preference is the presence of Pro at position 140 in the human AGT. Mutation of this residue to Ala to conform to the Ada-C sequence did not by itself alter the specificity of alkyl repair using the 16-mer ss oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates. However, when this alteration was combined with the insertion of the 6 amino acids from Ada-C between positions 158 and 165, the AGT protein showed a strong preference for methyl repair (Fig. 2). These results can be explained by the alteration in the active site pocket for the AGT. Several authors have suggested that AGT resembles a number of other DNA repair proteins in flipping the nucleotide to be repaired out of the DNA helix (29Demple B. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 719-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Roberts R.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31Verdine G.L.

This mechanism requires the “flipped” base to bind into an active site pocket. This pocket in AGT must contain the Cys-145 acceptor site and be able to accommodate the bulky and hydrophobic benzyl group. The replacement of the residues SGGLAV with RWGVSR is likely to both reduce the space available and to increase the hydrophilicity of the protein region forming this pocket. These alterations would reduce the ability to repairO 6-benzyl groups. The conversion of the preceding Pro140 residue to Ala changes the orientation of the peptide chain containing this 6-amino acid sequence and could position it in a way to further favor methyl repair. A second major conclusion from our results is that the structural features responsible for the good interaction of the wild type human AGT with O 6-benzylguanine as a free base are not identical to those for repair ofO 6-benzylguanine in ss oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Observations supporting this argument include: (a) the fact that the P140A and G156A mutant AGTs, which have greatly reduced rate of inactivation by freeO 6-benzylguanine (16Crone T.M. Goodtzova K. Edara S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6221-6227PubMed Google Scholar), resembled the wild type AGT in showing a preference for benzyl rather than methyl repair of 16-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides substrates (Fig. 2); (b) the replacement of the SGGLAV with RWGVSR to form AGT/6ada or P140A/6ada did not reduce reaction withO 6-benzylguanine as a free base (Table I) but did confer a preference for repair of methyl rather than benzyl in 16-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates (Fig. 2); and (c) the finding that inactivation of the P140A and G156A mutant AGTs byO 6-benzylguanine-containing oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates containing from 5 to 11 nucleotides required, respectively, only 4–11-fold higher concentrations of the inhibitor than the wild type as opposed to 25- and 300-fold higher concentrations of free O 6-benzylguanine (Fig. 3and Table II). These results are in agreement with a recent report that AGT can readily be inactivated by reaction with 25-mer substrates containing a central O 6-benzyl adduct includingO 6-(2-fluorobenzyl)guanine andO 6-benzylhypoxanthine, which are very poor inactivators of AGT when used as the free base (33Terashima I. Kawate H. Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M. Kohda K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). They are also consistent with our previous study showing that E. coliAda-C can react, albeit slowly, with a 16-mer containingO 6-benzylguanine (23Goodtzova K. Kanugula S. Edara S. Pauly G.T. Moschel R.C. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8332-8339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) although no reaction withO 6-benzylguanine as a free base could be detected (6Pegg A.E. Boosalis M. Samson L. Moschel R.C. Byers T.L. Swenn K. Dolan M.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11998-12006Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Several factors may contribute to the discrepancy in the AGT reactions with O 6-benzylguanine when presented as a free base and as a component of an oligodeoxyribonucleotide. A major influence is likely to be that the binding of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide is mediated predominantly by the DNA binding domain of the AGT. Although this domain has not been fully defined, studies based on the crystal structure of Ada-C and studies of mutations affecting DNA binding suggest that it is located in the helix-turn-helix region, which resides between amino acids Phe-94 and Asn-137 (24Kanugula S. Goodtzova K. Edara S. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7113-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Moore M.H. Gulbus J.M. Dodson E.J. Demple B. Moody P.C.E.

Novel Approaches in Anticancer Drug Design Molecular Modelling-New Treatment Strategies. 49. Karger, Basel1995: 16-24Google Scholar). This region is not altered in theO 6-benzylguanine-resistant mutants, and therefore the binding of oligodeoxyribonucleotides containingO 6-benzylguanine is unlikely to be affected greatly. Furthermore, binding is likely to present theO 6-benzyl adduct in the DNA in a manner favoring transfer to the cysteine acceptor site. The limiting factor in the reaction of the free base, O 6-benzylguanine, is likely to be the initial binding, which is very weak since theK d for binding is more than 1 mm. 2A. E. Pegg, unpublished observations. Mutations reducing the ability of O 6-benzylguanine to bind either by restricting the size of the binding pocket or by altering the largely hydrophobic face of this pocket may therefore cause a much greater decrease in the rate of benzyl transfer from the free base than from an oligodeoxyribonucleotide. A secondary factor that may also contribute to the better reaction withO 6-benzylguanine in ss oligodeoxyribonucleotides may be that the alkyltransferase protein undergoes a conformational change on binding DNA (24Kanugula S. Goodtzova K. Edara S. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7113-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Goodtzova K. Crone T. Pegg A.E.

This conformational change may expose and activate the cysteine acceptor group and may also alter the size of the active site pocket and thus allow better reaction with a bulky substrate. The development of drug resistance is a major problem in cancer chemotherapy. The ability of a number of different point mutations in the AGT sequence to give rise to resistance toO 6-benzylguanine (16Crone T.M. Goodtzova K. Edara S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6221-6227PubMed Google Scholar, 17Edara S. Kanugula S. Goodtzova K. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5571-5575PubMed Google Scholar, 18Christians F.C. Dawson B.J. Coates M.M. Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2007-2012PubMed Google Scholar) therefore raises considerable concern that such resistant forms may arise, or be selected for, during the course of chemotherapy with methylating or chloroethylating agents. This may necessitate the development of additional AGT inhibitors able to inactivate these resistant forms. Phase I clinical trials of O 6-benzylguanine indicate that plasma levels of the drug or active metabolites are unlikely to exceed 25 μm (9Dolan M.E. Pegg A.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 837-847PubMed Google Scholar) and this will not be adequate to inactivate known resistant AGT mutants. Short oligodeoxyribonucleotides containingO 6-benzylguanine may serve as the basis for the design of such agents. The results shown in Table II indicate that the rate of AGT reaction with oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing a central O 6-benzylguanine increases with oligodeoxyribonucleotide length but that a maximal rate only requires a 5–9-mer. This finding is in agreement with previous studies on the use of ss oligodeoxyribonucleotides containingO 6-methyl or ethyl adducts as AGT substrates (36Scicchitano D. Pegg A.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Liem L.K. Wong C.W. Lim A. Li B.F.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 950-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and with studies of oligodeoxyribonucleotide binding using biophysical techniques that suggest that the AGT contacts about 8 base pairs (35Chan C. Wui Z. Ciardelli T. Eastman A. Bresnick E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 38Takahashi M. Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15295-15301Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since the ED50 values for inactivation of AGT by such 5–9-mers were of the order of 7–60 nm(Table II), it should be possible to obtain adequate inhibition of the resistant mutants even though theO 6-benzylguanine-resistant AGT mutants were nearly an order of magnitude less sensitive to the oligodeoxyribonucleotides than the wild type. This approach should therefore prove useful for the design of therapeutically valuable AGT inhibitors."

Tnp preferentially acts on Tn5 elements located cisto its site of synthesis, whereas Inh is a trans-acting factor that decreases transposition. The Inh gene is read from the same reading frame as Tnp, but is under the control of separate transcription and translation start sites so that Inh lacks 55 aa of Tnp at the N terminus. In vitro, Tnp is necessary and sufficient for Tn5 transposition in the presence of Mg2+ and specific DNA sequences called outside ends (OE) (3Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Transposition is a multistep process relying on both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. In general, the ends of a transposon are bound, synapsed, and cleaved by two or more transposase molecules acting in concert. Subsequently, the protein-transposon complex recognizes target DNA and catalyzes strand transfer, an event which is also called integration. In the case of Tn5, Tnp binds and synapses pairs of OE sites (4de la Cruz N.B. Weinreich M.D. Wiegand T.W. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J.

Deletion of either α-homology region (amino acids 29–55 or 226–267) from the Rpb3 sequence abolished its ability to assemble into RNA polymerase II in vivo. Stoichiometry of the third largest subunit (Rpb3) of the yeast RNA polymerase II is a subject of continuing controversy.

Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II is a multisubunit enzyme comprised of 12 core polypeptides (1Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W.

With minor variations its subunit composition is characteristic of all eucaryal nuclear RNA polymerases and their archaeal counterparts (1Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W.

Despite the trivial quantitative differences, a profound similarity can also be found between these eucaryal/archaeal multisubunit enzymes and eubacterial RNA polymerases.

Instead, in an array of in vitro assays, Rpb3 was shown to associate with another apparent α-subunit homolog, Rpb11, with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (11Ulmasov T. Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or upon the actuality and biological relevance of the interactions detected in vitro (11Ulmasov T. Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12824-12830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this work we extended the elegant combinatorial approach of Guilfoyle and co-authors (11Ulmasov T. Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5085-5094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12824-12830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to the in vivo assembly of RNA polymerase. To that end we utilized a yeast host-vector system allowing simultaneous expression of the wild-type RPB3 gene from its native promoter and the His6-tagged RPB3 cassette from the vector-borne GAL1 promoter. Initial assumptions made in this work were: (i) stoichiometric incorporation of the Rpb3-tagged and -untagged subunits into RNA polymerase II and (ii) equally efficient incorporation and independent assortment of the tagged and untagged subunits during the polymerase assembly. These assumptions would yield different predictions depending on the stoichiometry of Rpb3 in the assembled polymerase. In the case of 1:1 stoichiometry of the third largest subunit relative to the polymerase core, only two classes of RNA polymerase II molecules should be present in the cell: one with tagged and another with untagged subunit. These two classes can be separated from each other using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. If the alternative (2:1) proposition were true, independent assortment of the His6-tagged and -untagged subunits would result in appearance of three distinct classes of RNA polymerase II molecules: two homogeneous classes with both Rpb3 subunits either tagged or untagged and the third class of heterogeneous RNA polymerase II, comprising one tagged and one untagged subunit. Consequently, these heterogeneous molecules would be recovered in the eluate off the Ni-NTA column at nondenaturing conditions, resulting in the appearance of the untagged subunit in the Ni-NTA binding fraction.By analyzing the relative abundance of the tagged and untagged Rpb3 protein in the crude and fractionated extracts of the yeast cells grown on different carbon sources, we established that RPB3 expression from the plasmid-borne GAL1 promoter is nearly identical to that from its native promoter in the cells grown on 2% raffinose (Fig. 1, lane 1, and data not shown). Western blot analysis of the immunoaffinity-purified RNA polymerase II confirmed our initial assumptions regarding comparable efficiencies of incorporation of the tagged and untagged versions of the third largest subunit into the assembled enzyme, as the relative levels of these subunits in the crude extract were similar to those in the anti-Rpb1 CTD mAb-binding fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3). The latter was then subjected to the Ni-NTA column chromatography; unbound RNA polymerase II material (pooled from the flow-through and wash fractions) and nickel-bound retentate from the 160 mmimidazole eluate were probed with anti-Rpb3 antibodies (Fig. 1,lanes 4 and 5). Analysis of these data unambiguously supports the conjecture of the third largest subunit being present in a single copy per molecule of the S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II, since not only was the untagged subunit not recovered in the nickel-bound fraction, the heterologous (one tagged + one untagged subunit) class of molecules, expected to be the most prominent in the nearly equimolar mixes of the two different, freely assorted subunits, was not found even among the unbound material (Fig. 1, lane 4). Our experiment clearly distinguishes between the two proposed Rpb3 stoichiometries in favor of the presence of only one such subunit per RNA polymerase molecule. This finding is consistent with the Rpb3-Rpb11 heterodimer being an ortholog of the α2-homodimer in eubacterial RNA polymerases (13Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12824-12830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Having established an efficient system of incorporation of the engineered Rpb3 into the in vivo assembled RNA polymerase II, we next investigated the role of the two segments of this polypeptide (amino acids 29–55 and 226–267), exhibiting some limited homology to the Escherichia coli α-subunit (13Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12824-12830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The Rpb3 mutant lacking amino acids 226–267 (Rpb3αC, calculated molecular mass 33,428 Da), when expressed from theGAL1 promoter in presence of raffinose, accumulated in the cell at the wild-type levels (Fig. 2 A, lane 1), but in contrast to its full-length counterpart Rpb3* (Fig. 1) was not found in the RNA polymerase II-containing fractions that eluted from the 8WG16-Sepharose (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 5). Instead, it appears to be present only in the flow-through fraction (Fig. 2 A, lane 2).Figure 2Rpb3 mutants defective in assembly of the RNA polymerase II in vivo.

Carles C. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5524-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) of Rpb3 (amino acids 29–55) corresponds to the region in the α-subunit where a number of mutations were isolated that affected α-α dimerization (17Kimura M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Kimura M. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 756-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Kimura M. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 342-349Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Kimura M. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the importance of this fragment for the assembly of the RNA polymerase II in vivo, we constructed a deletion mutant of RPB3, lacking the coding sequence for amino acids 29–55 (Rpb3αN), and cloned it into the p416GAL1 expression vector. Unlike the His6-tagged derivative of the wild-type Rpb3, whose calculated molecular mass was significantly larger than that of its untagged counterpart (38,034 versus 35,300 Da), His6-tagged mutant subunit comigrated with the untagged wild type polypeptide during SDS-PAGE (their calculated molecular masses being 35,077 and 35, 300 Da, respectively). In order to distinguish between the two, we utilized a combination of Rpb3-specific antibodies and His6-specific Ni-NTA-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. When subjected to the immunoaffinity chromatography on the 8WG16 column, all the Rpb3-associated Ni-NTA-binding potential eluted in the flow-through (data not shown), whereas a majority of the RNA polymerase II (the fraction containing nonproteolyzed Rpb1 CTD) eluted only after addition of propylene glycol (data not shown). Conversely, when the crude lysate from the cells, expressing both the untagged wild-type and the His6-tagged Δ29–55 mutant subunits, was passed through the Ni-NTA-agarose column, the bound material included the mutant His6-tagged protein, but not other Rpbs, such as the two largest, Rpb1 and Rpb2, and another α-ortholog, Rpb11 (Fig. 2, lane 1, and data not shown), that copurified in similar conditions with the wild-type His6-tagged Rpb3 (Fig. 2B, lane 2, and data not shown).Both mutant Rpb3 proteins accumulated in the cell at approximately the same level as the wild type and did not significantly affect growth even when overexpressed in the medium containing both raffinose and the inducing carbon source, galactose (data not shown).Thus, deletion of either α-homology region in the yeast Rpb3 effectively abolished its incorporation into the RNA polymerase II (in presence of the comparable amount of the wild-type protein). This finding is consistent with the relatively innocuous phenotype of these mutants in the merodiploid (relative to the RPB3 gene) yeast. The exact nature of the interactions disrupted by these mutations will be addressed in a series of the pairwise far-Western blot and pull-down experiments involving RNA polymerase II subassemblies and individual subunits. Our experimental approach serves as a complement to the techniques already in use in the research of RNA polymerase II (11Ulmasov T. Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5085-5094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol.

Among the substantial advantages of this approach is its operational simplicity, compared with the gene transplacement method used by Ishihama and co-workers (14Kimura M. Ishiguro A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25851-25855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to produce His6-tagged yeast RNA polymerase II. The fact that expression of the engineered subunit in yeast can be regulated over several orders of magnitude by changing the carbon source in the growth media or by switching to another of the many “sister” plasmids (15Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) allows not only the adjustment of the expression to the wild-type level, but also staging the in vivo “competition” experiments and overproduction of the His6-tagged subunits in yeast and E. coliusing the same expression cassette. 3V.

The question remains unanswered of the evolutionary bifurcation that separated eucaryal and archaebacterial enzymes with their α-like heterodimers (subunits 3/11 and D/L, respectively (Fig. 3)) from eubacterial RNA polymerases, built around α2-homodimer. Based on the phylogenetic clustering of the polypeptide sequences for the cloned α-homologs (Fig. 3), we find it plausible that a heterodimeric enzyme, similar in architecture to the eucaryal/archaebacterial RNA polymerases, existed prior to the separation of the three evolutionary lineages, with subsequent loss of the smaller (Rpb11- or l-like) subunit in the early history of eubacteria. This thesis is in agreement with previously proposed hypothesis of the reductionist evolution leading to the modern eubacterial RNA polymerases (2Langer D. Hain J. Thuriaux P. Zillig W. Proc. Natl.

Consequently, these heterogeneous molecules would be recovered in the eluate off the Ni-NTA column at nondenaturing conditions, resulting in the appearance of the untagged subunit in the Ni-NTA binding fraction.By analyzing the relative abundance of the tagged and untagged Rpb3 protein in the crude and fractionated extracts of the yeast cells grown on different carbon sources, we established that RPB3 expression from the plasmid-borne GAL1 promoter is nearly identical to that from its native promoter in the cells grown on 2% raffinose (Fig. 1, lane 1, and data not shown). Western blot analysis of the immunoaffinity-purified RNA polymerase II confirmed our initial assumptions regarding comparable efficiencies of incorporation of the tagged and untagged versions of the third largest subunit into the assembled enzyme, as the relative levels of these subunits in the crude extract were similar to those in the anti-Rpb1 CTD mAb-binding fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3). The latter was then subjected to the Ni-NTA column chromatography; unbound RNA polymerase II material (pooled from the flow-through and wash fractions) and nickel-bound retentate from the 160 mmimidazole eluate were probed with anti-Rpb3 antibodies (Fig. 1,lanes 4 and 5). Analysis of these data unambiguously supports the conjecture of the third largest subunit being present in a single copy per molecule of the S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II, since not only was the untagged subunit not recovered in the nickel-bound fraction, the heterologous (one tagged + one untagged subunit) class of molecules, expected to be the most prominent in the nearly equimolar mixes of the two different, freely assorted subunits, was not found even among the unbound material (Fig. 1, lane 4). Our experiment clearly distinguishes between the two proposed Rpb3 stoichiometries in favor of the presence of only one such subunit per RNA polymerase molecule. This finding is consistent with the Rpb3-Rpb11 heterodimer being an ortholog of the α2-homodimer in eubacterial RNA polymerases (13Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12824-12830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Having established an efficient system of incorporation of the engineered Rpb3 into the in vivo assembled RNA polymerase II, we next investigated the role of the two segments of this polypeptide (amino acids 29–55 and 226–267), exhibiting some limited homology to the Escherichia coli α-subunit (13Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12824-12830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The Rpb3 mutant lacking amino acids 226–267 (Rpb3αC, calculated molecular mass 33,428 Da), when expressed from theGAL1 promoter in presence of raffinose, accumulated in the cell at the wild-type levels (Fig. 2 A, lane 1), but in contrast to its full-length counterpart Rpb3* (Fig. 1) was not found in the RNA polymerase II-containing fractions that eluted from the 8WG16-Sepharose (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 5). Instead, it appears to be present only in the flow-through fraction (Fig. 2 A, lane 2).The NH2-terminal α-fragment (8Lalo D. Carles C. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5524-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) of Rpb3 (amino acids 29–55) corresponds to the region in the α-subunit where a number of mutations were isolated that affected α-α dimerization (17Kimura M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Kimura M. Ishihama A. J. Mol.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the importance of this fragment for the assembly of the RNA polymerase II in vivo, we constructed a deletion mutant of RPB3, lacking the coding sequence for amino acids 29–55 (Rpb3αN), and cloned it into the p416GAL1 expression vector. Unlike the His6-tagged derivative of the wild-type Rpb3, whose calculated molecular mass was significantly larger than that of its untagged counterpart (38,034 versus 35,300 Da), His6-tagged mutant subunit comigrated with the untagged wild type polypeptide during SDS-PAGE (their calculated molecular masses being 35,077 and 35, 300 Da, respectively). In order to distinguish between the two, we utilized a combination of Rpb3-specific antibodies and His6-specific Ni-NTA-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. When subjected to the immunoaffinity chromatography on the 8WG16 column, all the Rpb3-associated Ni-NTA-binding potential eluted in the flow-through (data not shown), whereas a majority of the RNA polymerase II (the fraction containing nonproteolyzed Rpb1 CTD) eluted only after addition of propylene glycol (data not shown). Conversely, when the crude lysate from the cells, expressing both the untagged wild-type and the His6-tagged Δ29–55 mutant subunits, was passed through the Ni-NTA-agarose column, the bound material included the mutant His6-tagged protein, but not other Rpbs, such as the two largest, Rpb1 and Rpb2, and another α-ortholog, Rpb11 (Fig. 2, lane 1, and data not shown), that copurified in similar conditions with the wild-type His6-tagged Rpb3 (Fig. 2B, lane 2, and data not shown).Both mutant Rpb3 proteins accumulated in the cell at approximately the same level as the wild type and did not significantly affect growth even when overexpressed in the medium containing both raffinose and the inducing carbon source, galactose (data not shown).Thus, deletion of either α-homology region in the yeast Rpb3 effectively abolished its incorporation into the RNA polymerase II (in presence of the comparable amount of the wild-type protein). This finding is consistent with the relatively innocuous phenotype of these mutants in the merodiploid (relative to the RPB3 gene) yeast. The exact nature of the interactions disrupted by these mutations will be addressed in a series of the pairwise far-Western blot and pull-down experiments involving RNA polymerase II subassemblies and individual subunits. Our experimental approach serves as a complement to the techniques already in use in the research of RNA polymerase II (11Ulmasov T. Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol.

The fact that expression of the engineered subunit in yeast can be regulated over several orders of magnitude by changing the carbon source in the growth media or by switching to another of the many “sister” plasmids (15Mumberg D.

The question remains unanswered of the evolutionary bifurcation that separated eucaryal and archaebacterial enzymes with their α-like heterodimers (subunits 3/11 and D/L, respectively (Fig. 3)) from eubacterial RNA polymerases, built around α2-homodimer. Based on the phylogenetic clustering of the polypeptide sequences for the cloned α-homologs (Fig. 3), we find it plausible that a heterodimeric enzyme, similar in architecture to the eucaryal/archaebacterial RNA polymerases, existed prior to the separation of the three evolutionary lineages, with subsequent loss of the smaller (Rpb11- or l-like) subunit in the early history of eubacteria. This thesis is in agreement with previously proposed hypothesis of the reductionist evolution leading to the modern eubacterial RNA polymerases (2Langer D. Hain J. Thuriaux P. Zillig W. Proc. Natl.

To that end we utilized a yeast host-vector system allowing simultaneous expression of the wild-type RPB3 gene from its native promoter and the His6-tagged RPB3 cassette from the vector-borne GAL1 promoter. Initial assumptions made in this work were: (i) stoichiometric incorporation of the Rpb3-tagged and -untagged subunits into RNA polymerase II and (ii) equally efficient incorporation and independent assortment of the tagged and untagged subunits during the polymerase assembly. These assumptions would yield different predictions depending on the stoichiometry of Rpb3 in the assembled polymerase. In the case of 1:1 stoichiometry of the third largest subunit relative to the polymerase core, only two classes of RNA polymerase II molecules should be present in the cell: one with tagged and another with untagged subunit. These two classes can be separated from each other using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. If the alternative (2:1) proposition were true, independent assortment of the His6-tagged and -untagged subunits would result in appearance of three distinct classes of RNA polymerase II molecules: two homogeneous classes with both Rpb3 subunits either tagged or untagged and the third class of heterogeneous RNA polymerase II, comprising one tagged and one untagged subunit. Consequently, these heterogeneous molecules would be recovered in the eluate off the Ni-NTA column at nondenaturing conditions, resulting in the appearance of the untagged subunit in the Ni-NTA binding fraction. By analyzing the relative abundance of the tagged and untagged Rpb3 protein in the crude and fractionated extracts of the yeast cells grown on different carbon sources, we established that RPB3 expression from the plasmid-borne GAL1 promoter is nearly identical to that from its native promoter in the cells grown on 2% raffinose (Fig. 1, lane 1, and data not shown). Western blot analysis of the immunoaffinity-purified RNA polymerase II confirmed our initial assumptions regarding comparable efficiencies of incorporation of the tagged and untagged versions of the third largest subunit into the assembled enzyme, as the relative levels of these subunits in the crude extract were similar to those in the anti-Rpb1 CTD mAb-binding fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3). The latter was then subjected to the Ni-NTA column chromatography; unbound RNA polymerase II material (pooled from the flow-through and wash fractions) and nickel-bound retentate from the 160 mmimidazole eluate were probed with anti-Rpb3 antibodies (Fig. 1,lanes 4 and 5).

The activities of the expressed wild type (WT) and mutant β subunits were assayed by following their capacity to assemble into the earlier prepared β-depleted, membrane-bound R. rubrum enzyme (Philosoph, S., Binder, A., and Gromet-Elhanan, Z. (1977)J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8742–8747) and to restore ATP synthesis and/or hydrolysis activity. All three mutations, β-E195K, β-E195Q, and β-E195G, were found to bind as the WTβ into the β-depleted enzyme. They restored between 30 and 60% of the WT restored photophosphorylation activity and 16, 45, and 105%, respectively of the CaATPase activity. The mutants required, however, much higher concentrations of divalent cations and could not restore any significant MgATPase or MnATPase activities. Only β-E195G could restore some of these activities when assayed in the presence of 100 mm sulfite and high MgCl2or MnCl2 concentrations. These results suggest that the observed difference in restoration of ATP synthesis and CaATPase, as compared with MgATPase and MnATPase, can be due to the tight regulation of the last two activities, resulting in their inhibition at cation/ATP ratios above 0.5. The R. rubrumF1β-E195 is equivalent to the mitochondrial F1β-E199, which points into the tunnel leading to the F1 catalytic nucleotide binding sites (Abrahams, J. P., Leslie, A. G. W., Lutter, R., and Walker, J. E. (1994) Nature 370, 621–628). Our findings indicate that this residue, although not an integral part of the F1catalytic sites, affects divalent cation binding and release of inhibitory MgADP, suggesting its participation in the interconversion of the F1 catalytic sites between different conformational states.

The catalytic F1component of the enzyme has been solubilized as a functional ATPase from many bacterial, mitochondrial, and chloroplast sources.

Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) suggested that ATP synthesis and hydrolysis involves transitions between such different conformational states via rotation of the γ-subunit relative to an α3β3subassembly. So this structural information initiated a drive to demonstrate that such rotation is possible (11Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 12Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 13Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). These important observations do not explain how rotation drives catalytic site transitions, which must involve intricate protein-protein interactions within the α/β catalytic interfaces as well as between them and various domains on the γ subunit. Full elucidation of the unique mechanism of action of the ATP synthases will therefore require clear definition of the role of amino acid residues that are involved in catalysis, as well as identification and detailed characterization of all interacting subdomains on the α, β, and γ subunits, and their relation to the catalytic sites. Genetic/biochemical assay systems that are crucial for such studies have been developed in respiratory bacteria and yeast mitochondria (see Refs. 1Futai M. Noumi T. Madea M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 2Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar, and 6Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), but the application of this approach to photosynthetic systems lagged behind the respiratory ones. Although the conserved structure of all isolated F1-ATPases suggests a common catalytic mechanism, there are clear differences in various properties between the respiratory and photosynthetic F0F1 and F1-complexes, for instance in regulation of activity and sensitivity to some inhibitors (3Gromet-Elhanan Z. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 807-839Google Scholar, 4McCarty R.E. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F.

Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reaction. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 453-468Google Scholar). It is, therefore, important to develop recombinant molecular techniques and direct in vivo and/or in vitro assays of activity for photosynthetic complexes containing mutated F1-subunits. Two such systems have recently been reported for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and spinach chloroplast F1-β subunits (14Avni A. Anderson J.D. Holland N. Rochaix J.D. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Edelman M.

The F1-β subunit of the photosynthetic bacteriumRhodospirillum rubrum(RrF1β) 1The abbreviations used are: RrF1β, RrF1α, CF1β, CF1α, EcF1β, MF1β, and TF1β, β and α subunits of the F1-ATPase of R. rubrum, chloroplasts, E. coli, mitochondria, and thermophilicBacillus PS3, respectively; Bchl, bacteriochlorophyll; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; WT, wild type; DCCD, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 1The abbreviations used are: RrF1β, RrF1α, CF1β, CF1α, EcF1β, MF1β, and TF1β, β and α subunits of the F1-ATPase of R. rubrum, chloroplasts, E. coli, mitochondria, and thermophilicBacillus PS3, respectively; Bchl, bacteriochlorophyll; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; WT, wild type; DCCD, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.provides an especially suitable system for mutational analysis, based on the available MF1 crystal structure. Thus, the published sequence of the RrF1 operon (18Falk G. Hampe A. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) revealed that RrF1β is most closely related to MF1β. Their amino acid sequences show >76% identity, as compared with only 72% for EcF1β, 69% for tobacco CF1β (18Falk G. Hampe A. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and 68% for TF1β (19Ohta S. Yohda M. Ishizuka M. Hirata H. Hamamoto T. Otawara-Hamamoto Y. Matsuda K. Kagawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The very high similarity between RrF1β and MF1β extends also to the R. rubrum and mitochondrial F0F1 and F1 which, unlike the chloroplast and Escherichia coli enzymes, exhibit an identical sensitivity to inhibition by oligomycin and efrapeptin (20Johansson, B. C., Baltscheffsky, M., Baltscheffsky, H., Proceedings of the IInd International Congress on Photosynthetic Research, Forti, G., Avron, M., Melandri, A., 2, 1971, 1203, 1209, Dr. W. Junk N.

Furthermore, a large number ofin vitro assays of activity have been developed for the RrF1β subunit that was isolated in functional form from the chromatophore membrane-bound RrF0F1. They include the ability of the isolated RrF1β to bind ATP, ADP, and Pi (23Gromet-Elhanan Z. Kananshvili D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1022-1028Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Khananshvili D. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2482-2487Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as well as to rebind to the β-depleted enzyme and restore its lost ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activities (25Philosoph S. Binder A. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8747-8752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gromet-Elhanan Z. Khananshvili D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 528-538Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Baltscheffsky et al. (27Baltscheffsky M. Nadanciva S. Harris D.A. Mutata N. Research in Photosynthesis. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 385-388Google Scholar) have cloned the RrF1β gene and expressed it in E. coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase but did not carry out any assays of activity. We have recently cloned this gene and have expressed the RrF1β subunit in E. colilacking the whole unc operon as a soluble protein that could restore ATP synthesis to β-depleted chromatophores (28Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar). Here we describe the expression and full purification of RrF1β mutated in Glu-195. A detailed comparison of the activities of these mutants with those of the expressed WT β subunit revealed that RrF1β-E195 plays an important role in divalent cation-dependent ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. R. rubrum cells were grown as described previously (25Philosoph S. Binder A. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8747-8752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three unc operon-deleted E. coli strains, LM2800, LM3115 (29Jensen P.R. Michelsen O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7635-7641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and DK8 (30Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used as hosts for recombinant plasmids (28Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar) carrying the WT and Glu-195 mutated RrF1β genes. The transformed cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with thymine (50 μg/ml), thiamine (2 μg/ml), 0.2 mm isoleucine, 0.2 mm valine, 0.2% glucose, and 5% glycerol. The RrF1β gene was amplified from R. rubrumgenomic DNA by PCR and cloned as described in (28Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar). Since the PCR is known to cause mutations, two PCR products, one obtained with Vent and the second with Taq DNA polymerase, were cloned and fully sequenced by the Taq dye deoxy chain termination method, using a 373A DNA Sequenase. Both clones were found to contain one mutated nucleotide. In the first clone, nucleotide 222 was changed, altering the published ACC codon of threonine 74 (18Falk G. Hampe A. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) into an ACA one that also codes for threonine. So this clone encodes the WT RrF1β polypeptide. But the second clone had a mutation in nucleotide 584, which changed the GAG codon of glutamic acid 195 into the GGG codon of glycine. This clone thus encodes an RrF1β-E195G mutant polypeptide. Additional mutations at RrF1β-E195 were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis with the U.S.E. mutagenesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the instructions of the supplier, using theEcoRI-BamHI PCR-prepared fragment containing the complete WT RrF1β gene (28Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar) cloned into pUC18. The mutagenic primers, which must anneal to the same strand of the heat-denatured plasmid DNA as the U.S.E. selection primer, were therefore designed with the 5′-end to right. The oligonucleotides used for the E195K and E195Q substitutions were, respectively: 3′-A-GAA-ATA-GTG-TTC-TAC-TAG-CTA -CGG-CCC-TAA-T-5′ and 3′-A-GAA-ATA-GTG-GTC-TAC-TAG-CTA -CGG-CCC-TAA-T-5′. They contained a new, underlined site for ClaI, introduced by a single base change, indicated by a bold letter as the bases changed to give the Lys or Gln codons. The U.S.E. selection primer eliminates the ScaI site in the pUC18 amp gene, but the repair defective E. coliNM 522 mutS strain, transformed with theScaI-resistant mutated plasmid DNA according to the instructions of the supplier, failed to grow in liquid medium. The transformed cells did, however, form ampicillin-resistant colonies when plated on solid agar. Introduction of the mutations into the RrF1β gene was confirmed by hybridization of these colonies with a 32P-labeled mutagenic primer. The mutations were further confirmed by ClaI restriction analysis, using the ClaI site introduced into the mutagenic primers, and by full DNA sequencing. The β-E195Q gene had only the stated mutation. But β-E195K had two additional changes: 1) in nucleotide 159, altering the codon from GTG to GTT, both coding for valine 53 (18Falk G. Hampe A. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); and 2) in nucleotide 1069, altering the codon from CTG to TTG, both coding for leucine 357 (18Falk G. Hampe A. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). So this gene also encodes only the stated mutation. Cultures of the various transformed unc-depleted E. colistrains were centrifuged and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0; 4 mm MgATP, and 10% glycerol, which is optimal for isolating active native RrF1β (25Philosoph S. Binder A. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8747-8752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protease inhibitors benzamidine, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, andN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone were added at 1.5 mm, 1 mm, and 30 μm, respectively, and the cells were disrupted under argon in a Yeda press (26Gromet-Elhanan Z. Khananshvili D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 528-538Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The soluble cytoplasmic and insoluble membrane fractions were analyzed for the presence of expressed RrF1β by SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205325) Google Scholar, 32Flings S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) and Western immunoblotting (33Gershoni J.M. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1988; 33: 1-58PubMed Google Scholar). β-less chromatophores were obtained as described in (26Gromet-Elhanan Z. Khananshvili D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 528-538Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This technique releases all their RrF1β (Refs. 25Philosoph S. Binder A. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8747-8752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 34Philosoph S. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar; see Fig. 4, lane 6) together with trace amounts of RrF1α (28Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar, 35Gromet-Elhanan Z. Sokolov M. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), leading to loss of their ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activity. Reconstitution was carried out by incubating β-less chromatophores, at 5 μg of Bchl, for 1 h at 35 °C in 0.2 ml of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 25 mmMgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and unless otherwise stated, 1 μg of RrF1α and saturating amounts of RrF1β at various stages of purification. ATP synthesis was usually assayed by a 5-fold dilution of the 0.2-ml mixture of reconstituted chromatophores into an assay mixture which contained in 1 ml a final concentration of 50 mmTricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm sodium phosphate (containing 0.4–0.8 × 106 cpm of 32Pi), 2 mmADP, 15 mm glucose, 24 units of hexokinase, and 66 μm N-methylphenazonium methosulfate. When assaying the Mg2+ requirement of the restored ATP synthesis (and hydrolysis), about 3 ml of the reconstituted chromatophores were subjected to two rounds of centrifugation and resuspension in 50 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol to remove the 25 mm MgCl2, which are essential for the reconstitution (25Philosoph S. Binder A. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8747-8752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gromet-Elhanan Z. Khananshvili D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 528-538Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These washed chromatophores, at 3–5 μg of Bchl, were added to the synthesis assay mixture, together with the indicated concentrations of MgCl2, and preequilibrated for 5 min at 35 °C in the dark. ATP synthesis was started by illumination and stopped after 3 min by turning off the lights and adding 0.1 ml of 2 m trichloroacetic acid. The synthesized [γ-32P]ATP was determined as described by Avron (36Avron M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 40: 257-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). For assaying restored ATP hydrolysis, the washed chromatophores, at 3–5 μg of Bchl, were preincubated for 5 min at 35 °C in 0.66 ml of 50 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0) with the divalent cation concentrations indicated in the text. Hydrolysis was started by addition of 40 μl of ATP to a final concentration of 4 mmand stopped by 0.1 ml of 2 m trichloroacetic acid. The released Pi was measured according to (37Takeyama M. Ihara K. Moriyama Y. Ida K. Tomioka N. Itai A. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 265: 21279-21284Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For measurement of ATP binding, purified RrF1β preparations were depleted of bound MgATP by elution-centrifugation through Sephadex G-50 columns (38Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) preequilibrated with TGN buffer containing 50 mmTricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 20% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl. Binding was assayed by incubating 10 μm depleted RrF1β for 90 min at 23 °C in TG buffer with the indicated concentrations of MgCl2 and ATP, containing 1–2 × 106 cpm of [2,8-3H]ATP. Incubation was started by addition of RrF1β and stopped by subjecting 50-μl samples to elution-centrifugation, and the effluent was assayed for protein and radioactivity as described by Gromet-Elhanan and Kananshvili (23Gromet-Elhanan Z. Kananshvili D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1022-1028Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured either by the BCA method (39Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18305) Google Scholar) or according to Lowry et al. (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Bchl content of chromatophores was determined at 880 nm using the absorption coefficient in vivo given by Clayton (41Clayton R.K. Gest H. San Pietro A. Vernon L.P. Bacterial Photosynthesis. Antioch Press, Yellow Springs, OH1963: 495-500Google Scholar). E. coli DK8 was a gift of Dr. M. Futai, Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University. E. coli LM2800 and LM3115 were a gift of Dr. P. R. Jensen, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Dr. Ora Goldberg, Biological Services, The Weizmann Institute of Science. Restriction enzymes, Vent DNA polymerase, and T4 ligase were from New England Biolabs.Taq DNA polymerase, and dNTP were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Plasmids pBSKS+ and pBTacI were from Stratagene and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. The U.S.E. Mutagenesis Kit was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.. [2,8-3H]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. The β-E195G mutation was obtained as a mistake, which changed the GAG codon of glutamic acid to the GGG codon of glycine, during amplification of the RrF1β gene from genomic R. rubrum DNA by PCR. Since the equivalent MF1β-E199 is described in the crystal structure as pointing into the conical tunnel leading to the catalytic nucleotide binding site (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2707) Google Scholar), it was interesting to check whether the E195G mutation affects activity. Using the system described previously (28Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar), the expressed, partially purified mutated β subunit was found to restore a much lower rate of ATP synthesis in β-less chromatophores than the native or expressed WT RrF1β. We have therefore prepared two additional RrF1 β-E195 mutants by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis: from glutamic acid to lysine (β-E195K), carrying a positive charge, and to glutamine (β-E195Q), carrying no charge. Cloned WT and mutant β genes were ligated into the expression vector pBTacI, and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli LM3115 (28Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar). This strain was found to express larger amounts of RrF1β than two otherunc-deleted strains, LM2800 (29Jensen P.R. Michelsen O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7635-7641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and DK8 (30Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), under all tested growth conditions (not shown). Optimal conditions for expression of large amounts of RrF1β as a soluble protein include growth of E. coli LM3115 at 22 °C in the presence of 5% glycerol to about A 0.65. Growth at higher temperatures or to a higher optical density increased the fraction of expressed β subunit appearing in inclusion bodies (42Nathanson, L. (1997) Cloning, Expression and Activity of Wild Type and Mutant B Subunits of the Rhodospirillum rubrum F0F1 ATP Synthase, Ph.D. thesis, The Weizmann Institute of Science.Google Scholar). The soluble cytoplasmic fraction of E. coli LM3115 cells containing the expressed WT and mutated RrF1β was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation as described for native RrF1β (34Philosoph S. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The 30–60% ammonium sulfate precipitate was dissolved in TGN buffer to a concentration of about 10 mg of protein/ml and thoroughly dialyzed against the same buffer. The WT and β-E195G mutant were further purified by dye-ligand chromatography on a Red A column. As is illustrated in Fig. 1, the dialyzed WT β subunit was loaded on a column preequilibrated in TGN buffer at 4 °C. After 1 h, the column was washed with TGN buffer, to elute all the unbound protein (Fig. 1, A,peak I, and B, lane 3). The RrF1β was then eluted with TGN buffer containing 1 mm MgATP (Fig. 1, A, peak II, andB, lane 4). Further washing with TGN buffer containing 1 mm MgATP and 1.5 m NaCl did not elute any additional RrF1β subunit (Fig. 1, A,peak III, and B, lane 5). This column yielded a highly purified expressed WT RrF1β (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), which contained, of course, no trace of RrF1α. On the other hand, the earlier prepared native RrF1β, which was removed by LiCl extraction ofR. rubrum chromatophores (25Philosoph S. Binder A. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8747-8752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by chromatography through two ion-exchange columns (26Gromet-Elhanan Z. Khananshvili D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 528-538Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was recently found to contain 5–10% of RrF1α (28Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar, 35Gromet-Elhanan Z. Sokolov M. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Most of this α subunit was removed by dye-ligand chromatography, leaving a pure native RrF1β containing less than 1% of RrF1α. All three types of RrF1β subunits were found to bind, in the presence of Mg2+, up to 2 mol of ATP/mol of β. But, whereas the binding of ATP to the expressed WT as to pure native RrF1β (Fig. 2), saturated at 200 μm ATP and showed a pronounced cooperativity, with a Hill coefficient (n H) of 2.2, the RrF1β-E195G mutant required a higher concentration of ATP for saturation and showed a much lower cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of only 1.5. The native RrF1β, which contained at least 5% of RrF1α (28Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 51-54Google Scholar, 35Gromet-Elhanan Z. Sokolov M. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), was earlier shown to bind up to 2 mol of ATP/mol (23Gromet-Elhanan Z. Kananshvili D.
