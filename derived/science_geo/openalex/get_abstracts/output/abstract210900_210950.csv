https://openalex.org/W1971935437,"Experiments on clotting, both in vitro and in vivo, showed that a colloidal graphite surface, when rinsed with a cationic, surface-active agent, was capable of bonding heparin. The resistance of this graphite-heparin surface to the formation of clots was far greater than plastic or silicone surfaces in comparable studies."
https://openalex.org/W2062649297,The cellular changes which lead to the increase of drug-metabolizing enzymes following drug administration are explained by correlating new biochemical data with previously reported electron microscopic and pharmacologic observations. Repeated administration of phenobarbital and several other drugs results in a quantitative increase of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the liver cell. The marked increase in drug-metabolizing enzymes is found to occur in this enlarged smooth membrane fraction of the endoplasmic reticulum.

https://openalex.org/W2072843253,"Lipid is released in the form of diglyceride from the fat body of the cecropia silkmoth (Hyalophora cecropia), in both adults and pupae. This diglyceride, in the form of a complex with hemolymph protein, is the most probable means by which lipid is transported in this insect."
https://openalex.org/W1973573579,"Secretion of concentrated salt solutions from the nasal region was observed in several terrestrial birds and reptiles. In the secreted fluid potassium usually exceeded sodium concentrations, with chloride and bicarbonate as the major anions. It is suggested that the extrarenal excretion of salts is related to the reabsorption of water in the cloaca, that it is necessary for the production of urine with a particularly low water content, and perhaps was prerequisite for the evolution of efficient cloacal water conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2093005667,"Mice in group 1 (controls) spent all their lives with other mice. Mice in group 2 had experience only with male and female rats after weaning; group 3 mice had no experience with peersâ€”each litter was reduced to one pup, which was reared in isolation after weaning; group 4 mice were fostered to a lactating rat mother at approximately 3 days of age and thereafter lived only with rats. In adulthood group 4 mice were the least active and group 3 the most; mice in groups 2 and 4 preferred to spend time in a chamber adjacent to a rat, those from groups 1 and 3 in a chamber containing another mouse; when mice were paired off within experimental groups and given the opportunity to fight each other, the percentage of pairs in which fights occurred for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were, respectively, 44, 27, 100, and 0."

https://openalex.org/W2984533981,"Electrophoretic resolution of lactate dehydrogenase in mature testes from a variety of animals revealed one or more unusual isozymes in addition to the usual five forms. Dissociation of the enzyme and recombination of the polypeptide subunits led to the formation of new isozymes and to a redistribution of activity among those normally present, indicating that lactate dehydrogenase synthesis in postpubertal testis is controlled by more than two genes."
https://openalex.org/W1982093274,"Evidence obtained from high-speed cinephotography of the microcirculation in the mesentery of the dog shows that the shape of the red blood cell is changed during its flow through capillaries from a biconcave disk to a paraboloid with a hollow bell-like center. The degree of deformation is dependent upon the velocity of flow in the capillaries. Although the effect of change in shape on the surface area of the cell is uncertain, a larger portion of the surface is brought into closer proximity to the capillary wall than in a cell that is in the form of a biconcave disk. Thus, the change in shape may have functional significance related to the exchange of respiratory gases."
https://openalex.org/W2014271647,"HeLa cells normally contain a distribution of polysome sizes, and the largest polysomes contain over 40 ribosomes. After infection with polio virus and actinomycin-D treatment, a new class of polio-induced polysomes are found, some of which contain up to 60 ribosomes. Examinaton of these polysomes suggests a mechanism for protein synthesis with this polycistronic RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2051235695,"Benzene hexachloride and dieldrin are present in the body fat of people in the general population of the United States. The mean concentration of dieldrin is 0.15 +/- 0.02 parts per million, which is in good agreement with the concentration reported for southern England. The mean concentration of benzene hexachloride is 0.20 +/- 0.04 ppm, which is considerably lower than the mean concentration reported for France. Paired analyses of DDT by gas chromatographic and colorimetric methods show that the results of the latter may give incorrectly high results when applied to human fat."
https://openalex.org/W2149629946,"Temporary homologous bone marrow grafts were observed in three patients with acute leukemia, receiving intensive antileukemic treatment, following transfusion of peripheral blood cells from donors with chronic myelocytic leukemia. Persistent mitosis of the transfused cells, containing the Philadelphia chromosome marker, were detected by cytogenetic techniques 19, 39, and 52 days after transfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2092803144,"Oxygen flux across the anterior surface of the human cornea from a closed reservoir of air-saturated, physiological, isotonic saline was measured in vivo as a function of time. The rate of oxygen consumption calculated from this flux compares favorably with estimates given in the literalure, which were based on studies in which the microrespirometer technique of Warburg was used."
https://openalex.org/W2008616834,"The disappearance of inhaled bacteria from the lungs of mice is rapid and predictable over an 8-hour period following pulmonary implantation by an aerosol. This indicates that important clearance mechanisms are active in the bronchopulmonary tree. The constant pattern of clearance offers an experimental system in which the effects of various conditions relevant to respiratory infection can be estimated quantitatively. Herein, the effects of hypoxia, alcohol, cigarette smoke, and cortisone are described."
https://openalex.org/W2072129451,"The ubiquitously distributed complex of enzymes, the RNA methylases, the apparent function of which is the alteration of the structure of transfer RNA at the macromolecular level by the introduction of methyl groups into the component bases, are concentrated in the nucleolus, an organelle previously implicated in RNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1996983626,"Systolic blood pressure measurements were made on normal human subjects throughout entire nights of natural sleep and were correlated with cyclical changes in electroencephalographic patterns. During the recurrent rapid-eye-movement phase of sleep mean blood pressure levels were found to be generally higher, and the minute-to-minute variability of level was much greater than during the remainder of sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2056018908,Prolactin activity in the hypophyses of rats maintained under standardized conditions was assayed in pigeons. The concentration of prolactin in the gland exhibited a circadian rhythm.
https://openalex.org/W2017651648,"Specifically purified rabbit antiovalbumin and normal gamma-globulin labeled with 1-131 were dissociated into half molecules by reduction and acidification. When a mixture of the two preparations was neutralized, a large proportion of mixed molecules having active combining sites and the same sedimentation coefficient as the original gamma-globulins was formed. Since the sulfhydryl groups were inactivated after reduction, the recombined subunits appear to be linked by noncovalent bonds."

https://openalex.org/W2086527468,Selenomethionine and selenocystine protect amino acid and protein systems from radiation damage. Selenoamino acids are more powerful protectors than the analogous sulfur amino acids and other known -SH protectors. Free-radical scavenger and repair mechanisms by which selenoamino acids react with induced free radicals may be the key reactions in the biological function of logical function of selenium.
https://openalex.org/W2052177959,"Lipids of the rat heart were labeled with carbon-14 in vivo. The production of C(14)O(2) during the subsequent perfusion of these glycogen-depleted hearts with buffer, but without added substrate, provided direct evidence of the oxidation of endogenous heart lipids. The net decrease in phospholipid content alone could account for 75 percent of the total metabolic CO(2) formed."
https://openalex.org/W2017974785,"Addition of 1.7 x 10-(5)M zinc sulfate to cultures of Rhizopus nigricans increases growth and substrate utilization. Analysis of cells during the course of growth, after addition of the metal, showed that there was an immediate increase in RNA, followed by a corresponding increase in protein and cell mass. The DNA content was affected to a lesser extent. It is postulated that Zn(++) stimulates growth through a primary effect on RNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1980844756,New nuclear magnetic resonance data lead to a completely unambiguous proof that the predominant tautomeric form of 1-methylcytosine is the amino form and that in acid solution the molecule protonates at 3-N. The close similarity of the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of this compound to the spectra of the cytosine nucleosides indicates that these structures also exist in the nucleosides. These conclusions are reached on the basis of the spectra of analogs labeled with N15 and of the proton spin decoupling measurements made at low temperature.
https://openalex.org/W1985850595,"Plasma lipoproteins, extensively extracted with organic solvents, contain small quantities of firmly bound long-chain fatty acids. Upon enzymatic digestion of the protein and partial purification of the resulting peptides, fatty acids are found associated with a peptide fraction which contains organic phosphate. The nature of the linkage between the fatty acid and peptide is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1970680051,"The metabolism of galactose by liver tissue from fetal, new-born, pre-adult, and adult rats was studied in vitro by determining the extent of conversion of galactose to CO(2) and the disappearance of the sugar from the incubation medium. Results indicate that the utilization of galactose by liver tissue decreases as the organism grows older. The explanation of the tendency of patients with congenital galactosemia to improve symptomatically with age on the basis of ""maturation"" of galactose metabolizing pathways in their livers does not appear to be consistent with these observations."
https://openalex.org/W2010009540,"Body temperatures of Tadarida mexicana in their natural cave environment were usually maintained at high levels, even when ambient temperatures were low. Oxygen consumption rates were correspondingly higher in low environmental temperatures. However, in laboratory tests, body temperatures and metabolic rates are fairly dependent on ambient temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2108189956,"An arginine-requiring mutant of Neurospora lacks the carbamyl phosphokinase activity present in other strains. Although carbamyl phosphate, the product of this enzyme, is required in both arginine and pyrimidine synthesis, the enzymne appears to serve only the arginine pathway. A pyrimidine specific mode of carbamyl phosphate synthesis is inferred, although it has not yet been demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2074906154,The zooflagellate Leishmania enriettii synthesizes alpha-linolenic acid as determined by experiments with stearic acid uniformly labeled with C(14). This is the first demonstration of the synthesis of alpha-linolenic acid by a nonphotosynthetic organism.
https://openalex.org/W1987642973,"Serum cholesterol level ( SCL) was measured in 600 mice belonging to five inbred strains of mice ( DBAIIJ, C57BL/ 1OJ, A/ J, C3H/ HeJ, and BALBI cJ) and all 20 F, hybrids resulting from the systematic crossing of the inbreds. Diet was kept constant and its effect on SCL was not evaluated. The data show that in mice, the mode of inheritance of SCL is neither dominant nor recessive, but is intermediate. A simple additive model accounts for the results: the SCL is a linear function of the SCL of the mother, the SCL of the sire, and the sex of the subject; the three factors do not interact."
https://openalex.org/W2069130415,"Dormant ascospores contain the same ribosomal population as growing hyphae and resting conidia. This conclusion is based on analyses of sedimentation coefficients and of nucleotide composition of ribosomes, ribosomal RNA, and soluble RNA. Thus dormancy is not characterized by the absence of the important parts of the protein-synthesizing apparatus."

https://openalex.org/W2058369552,"The agglutination that occurs when rheumatoid arthritis serum Pond is added to erythrocytes sensitized with anti-D serum Moore is inhibited in the presence of some normal serums. The inhibitor, tentatively named Gm(p), is associated only with 7S gamma globulins and is apparently different from other previously defined serum groups. It is much more common in Caucasians than in Negroes, and probably is determined by a simple dominant gene."

https://openalex.org/W2035909704,Busy coats from the peripheral bloods of persons known to give a positive reaction to purified protein derivative and of those known to be negative were treated with purified protein derivative conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Lymphocytes from positive reactors took up the labeled antigen in significantly greater numbers than did those from negative reactors. Leukocytes from newborns showed far less affinity for the antigen than leukocytes from adult negative reactors.
https://openalex.org/W1985574182,"The nasal salt-secreting gland of the domestic duck can produce a fluid with a sodium chloride concentration about three times that in blood plasma. To study the cellular mechanism responsible for the formation of the highly concentrated fluid, the gland was poisoned by retrograde injection of mercuric chloride into the lumen, decreasing the salt concentration to that in plasma while the volume of secretion was unchanged. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazoleamide) caused a moderate decrease in salt concentrations, again with maintenance of volume of secretion. The results suggest that concentration and volume of the secreted fluid depend on two different cellular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2033229128,"The ""excessive functional activity"" of some cancer cells first found by Caspersson has been observed in fixed, stained smears of cervical epidermoid carcinomas from four patients. Preliminary results suggest that there may be a characteristic difference between the absorption profiles of some epidermoid cancer cells and other cells found in cytological smears. It is our belief that with an appropriate electronic scanning system such cells can be detected by measurements of their absorptions at two different wavelengths. However, the effect on the absorptions of cells with abnormalities other than cancer, and whether every epidermoid carcinoma will contain such cells, must yet be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2085427960,Differential activity was induced in the electroencephalograms of the occipital lobes by limiting intermittent photic stimulation to the right or left halves of the two retinas. The results indicate that the driving of one hemisphere also affects the opposite hemisphere and that the amount and pattern of the effect is determined by the hemisphere being directly stimulated.

https://openalex.org/W2006914301,"Toxohormone preparations obtained from yeast mutants with impaired respiration and from cancerous tissues inhibited the growth of an unstable strain of yeast in media containing lactate as the carbon source. Depending on the source of the different toxohormone preparations, amounts ranging from 5 to 9.5 mg/ml inhibited growth by 50 percent. This phenomenon could be utilized in quantitative evaluations of toxohormone activity."
https://openalex.org/W2022692056,"Rats were sensitized by mouth with dihydrotachysterol and subsequently challenged by a subcutaneous injection of ferric dextran. Mineralization at the injection site is barely detectable 17 hours after challenge. If, at this time, the challenged skin is transplanted onto a normal recipient, mineralization continues in the nonsensitized host. Sensitization is indispensable only for the initiation of the calciphylactic response and, once ""triggered,"" the mechanism for this type of mineralization is transferable."
