https://openalex.org/W1968890500,"Circadian Oscillations The 24-hour day-night cycle plays an important role in mammalian physiology and behavior and, as most travelers are well aware, there is an intimate link between our in-built circadian clocks and metabolic rhythms. This link is in part forged by the protein deacetylase SIRT1, which regulates the clock's molecular circuitry. SIRT1 uses as a cofactor the cellular metabolite NAD + , which is synthesized through a salvage pathway that includes the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) (see the Perspective by Wijnen ). Ramsey et al. (p. 651 ; published online 19 March) and Nakahata et al. (p. 654 , published online 12 March) now show that NAMPT and NAD + levels oscillate during the daily 24-hour cycle and that this oscillation is regulated by the circadian clock. Furthermore, the oscillations in NAD + modulate the activity of SIRT1 feeding back into the circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W1970195561,"Mutational activation of BRAF is the earliest and most common genetic alteration in human melanoma. To build a model of human melanoma, we generated mice with conditional melanocyte-specific expression of BRaf(V600E). Upon induction of BRaf(V600E) expression, mice developed benign melanocytic hyperplasias that failed to progress to melanoma over 15-20 months. By contrast, expression of BRaf(V600E) combined with Pten tumor suppressor gene silencing elicited development of melanoma with 100% penetrance, short latency and with metastases observed in lymph nodes and lungs. Melanoma was prevented by inhibitors of mTorc1 (rapamycin) or MEK1/2 (PD325901) but, upon cessation of drug administration, mice developed melanoma, indicating the presence of long-lived melanoma-initiating cells in this system. Notably, combined treatment with rapamycin and PD325901 led to shrinkage of established melanomas. These mice, engineered with a common genetic profile to human melanoma, provide a system to study melanoma's cardinal feature of metastasis and for preclinical evaluation of agents designed to prevent or treat metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1989208474,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in neurons and glia. Although Tau is normally considered an intracellular protein, Tau aggregates are observed in the extracellular space, and Tau peptide is readily detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Tau aggregation occurs in many diseases, including Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia. Tau pathology begins in discrete, disease-specific regions but eventually involves much larger areas of the brain. It is unknown how this propagation of Tau misfolding occurs. We hypothesize that extracellular Tau aggregates can transmit a misfolded state from the outside to the inside of a cell, similar to prions. Here we show that extracellular Tau aggregates, but not monomer, are taken up by cultured cells. Internalized Tau aggregates displace tubulin, co-localize with dextran, a marker of fluid-phase endocytosis, and induce fibrillization of intracellular full-length Tau. These intracellular fibrils are competent to seed fibril formation of recombinant Tau monomer in vitro. Finally, we observed that newly aggregated intracellular Tau transfers between co-cultured cells. Our data indicate that Tau aggregates can propagate a fibrillar, misfolded state from the outside to the inside of a cell. This may have important implications for understanding how protein misfolding spreads through the brains of tauopathy patients, and it is potentially relevant to myriad neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding.

Tau filament deposition in Alzheimer disease (AD), 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; AF488, AlexaFluor488; Tau-YFP, full-length Tau tagged with YFP; MTBR-YFP, microtubule-binding region tagged with YFP; FTD, frontotemporal dementia; AFM, atomic force microscopy; MTBR, microtubule-binding region; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other tauopathies correlates closely with cognitive dysfunction and cell death (1Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar). Mutations in the tau gene cause autosomal dominant tauopathy, implicating Tau as the proximal cause (2Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S. Houlden H. Pickering-Brown S. Chakraverty S.

Goedert M. Farlow M.R. Klug A. Ghetti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Specific disease phenotypes are defined by the early sites of pathology. For example, AD is characterized by memory loss that derives from involvement of hippocampal neurons, whereas FTD is characterized by personality changes that result from frontal lobe involvement (5Liu W. Miller B.L. Kramer J.H. Rankin K. Wyss-Coray C. Gearhart R. Phengrasamy L. Weiner M. Rosen H.J. Neurology. 2004; 62: 742-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Pathology ultimately spreads to involve much larger regions of brain. Studies on patients with AD show a progressive, stereotyped spread of Tau deposits from the transentorhinal cortex to the hippocampus, and eventually to most cortical areas (6Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11766) Google Scholar, 7Braak H. Braak E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar, 8Delacourte A.

Others have correlated the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles of Tau in AD brains with trans-synaptic distance from the affected areas (9Arnold S.E. Hyman B.T. Flory J. Damasio A.R. Van Hoesen G.W. Cereb. Cortex. 1991; 1: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). A similar spread affecting different subsets of neurons has been observed in other sporadic tauopathies, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (10Sergeant N. Wattez A. Delacourte A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). It is unknown why Tau misfolding progresses through the brain, whether it is a sequence of cell autonomous processes or whether a toxic factor is involved. Loss of synaptic connections and cell death may expose healthy cells to toxic factors and decrease available neurotrophins (11Akiyama H. Barger S. Barnum S. Bradt B. Bauer J. Cole G.M. Cooper N.R.

Another possibility is that the Tau protein itself serves as the agent of trans-cellular propagation. For example, it has been shown that extracellular Tau is toxic to cultured neuronal cells (13Gomez-Ramos A. Diaz-Hernandez M. Cuadros R. Hernandez F. Avila J. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4842-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 14Gomez-Ramos A. Diaz-Hernandez M. Rubio A. Miras-Portugal M.T. Avila J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 37: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that immunotherapy against Tau reduces pathology in a mouse model (15Asuni A.A. Boutajangout A. Quartermain D. Sigurdsson E.M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9115-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Tau is well known as an intracellular protein that stabilizes microtubule filaments (16Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar); however, it is readily detected in cerebrospinal fluid (17Vandermeeren M. Mercken M. Vanmechelen E. Six J. van de Voorde A. Martin J.J. Cras P. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1828-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and as extracellular aggregates, termed “ghost tangles,” in diseased brain. These are comprised predominantly of the microtubule-binding region (MTBR), the functional and pathogenic core of the Tau protein (18Endoh R. Ogawara M. Iwatsubo T. Nakano I. Mori H. Brain Res. 1993; 601: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that Tau aggregates present in the extracellular space enter naive cells and induce misfolding of intracellular Tau. We have tested this idea using cellular studies, biochemistry, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Tau Expression, Purification, and Fibrillization—The MTBR (amino acids 243–375) of full-length (P10636-8) wild-type tau (a gift from Dr. Virginia Lee) was subcloned into pRK172. HA-tagged MTBR Tau contains the sequence YPYDVPDYA on its C terminus. Recombinant Tau MTBR was prepared as described previously from Rosetta (DE3)pLacI competent cells (Novagen), exploiting the heat stability of Tau protein followed by cation exchange chromatography (19Goedert M. Jakes R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Single-use aliquots were stored at -80 °C in 10 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). To induce fibrillization of Tau monomer, the MTBR was incubated at room temperature without agitation in 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 150 μm arachidonic acid (Sigma). Incubation times from 3 to 24 h produced similar results. Atomic Force Microscopy and Antibody Decoration—Tau fibrillization reactions were incubated on freshly cleaved mica (Ted Pella, Inc.) for 2 min. The sample was then rinsed twice with 200 μl of water. After washing, samples exposed to antibody decoration were incubated with 20 μg/ml Tau5 antibody (BD Biosciences) for 2 min. The sample was rinsed twice with water and left to dry for at least 1 h prior to tapping mode atomic force microscopy (Digital Instruments). Western Blots—HEK293 or C17.2 cells were seeded 300,000 or 75,000 cells/well, respectively, in a 24-well plate. The following day, cells were transfected with 1.2 μg of full-length wild-type Tau-YFP or MTBR-YFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 15 h, cells were replated 1:4 in a 24-well plate, allowed to re-adhere for 5 h, and treated with 0.4 μm Tau buffer, monomer, or aggregates. After 15 h, cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin for 3 min, pelleted, and lysed in 40 μl of 1% Triton in PBS plus a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) (lysis buffer). As an additional control, untreated cells were treated with an equivalent concentration of aggregates after lysis. Soluble and insoluble fractions of cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation of lysates at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Insoluble pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer and resuspended in 40 μl of lysis buffer. For whole cell lysates, cells were harvested and syringe-lysed in PBS plus a protease inhibitor tablet. Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel, whereas whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 4–15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Following transfer to a nylon membrane (Millipore), blots were probed with either the Tau5 antibody (1:5,000; BD Biosciences), which recognizes an epitope in the polyproline region of Tau protein (intracellular transfected Tau) that is not present in the MTBR (extracellular Tau), or the GFP sc-8334 antibody (1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were stripped and reprobed with the I-19-R anti-actin antibody (1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HA Y.11 (1:2,000, Covance) was used to probe for MTBR-HA Tau. Immunofluorescence—All cells were grown on polyornithine-coated glass coverslips for microscopy. For visualization of intracellular Tau-YFP and MTBR-YFP, cells were transfected with Tau-YFP or MTBR-YFP. Cells were fixed with -20 °C methanol for 7 min and stained for α-tubulin (1:500; Sigma) followed by secondary staining with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody A546 (1:500; Molecular Probes). To visualize MTBR-AF488 aggregates inside cells, buffer, MTBR monomer, and MTBR aggregates were labeled with 62.5 ng/μl AF488 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C. Reactions were quenched with 100 mm glycine and added to cells. After 15 h, cells were treated with either PBS or 0.25% trypsin for 3 min and allowed to recover for 5 h before methanol fixation and staining for α-tubulin. Z-stacks were rendered into a three-dimensional image using the NIS-Elements AR 3.0 software (Nikon) from which an apical to distal slice containing the aggregate was obtained. For co-labeling with dextran, C17.2 cells were treated with MTBR-AF488 and 50 μg/ml rhodamine-dextran (Mr 10,000, pH neutral; Molecular Probes) for 4 h. Cells were trypsinized, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and prepared as described above. For extracellular MTBR-HA and intracellular Tau-YFP co-localization studies, C17.2 cells expressing Tau-YFP were incubated with buffer, MTBR-HA monomer, or MTBR-HA aggregates for 15 h. Cells were trypsinized and allowed to recover as described before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were stained with the HA-Y11 antibody (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by secondary labeling with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes). For co-culture experiments, C17.2 cells were transfected separately with MTBR-YFP and SV40-mCherry (a gift of Dr. Anthony Gerber) or Tau-YFP and mCherry. Cells were treated with Tau buffer, 0.4 μm Tau monomer, or 0.4 μm MTBR Tau aggregates. After the indicated co-culture incubation, cells were fixed for 7 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma), and mounted on glass slides for imaging. Confocal microscopy was performed on a C1sl confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc.). Flow Cytometry—AF488 containing buffer or MTBR-AF488 was incubated with cells for the time indicated. Cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin for 3 min and resuspended in PBS plus 10% fetal bovine serum prior to flow cytometry. Cells were counted in a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. Each experiment was repeated four times, and 10,000 cells were counted in each individual experiment. For co-culture experiments, MTBR-YFP or Tau-YFP expressing cells were co-cultured with SV40-mCherry-expressing cells. Tau-YFP expressing cells were treated with buffer, MTBR monomer, or MTBR aggregates for indicated durations prior to flow cytometry. To collect dual positive cells, cells were sorted in a FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Sarkosyl Extraction—1% Sarkosyl-insoluble material was purified from cell lysates from a confluent 5-cm cell culture dish as described previously (20Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5827-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Cell lysis buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.8 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, and a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). When Sarkosyl-insoluble material from cells was used to seed the Tau monomer, the reactions contained 90 μl of 4 μm MTBR Tau monomer, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 μl of syringe-sheared Sarkosyl-insoluble material from a 5-cm dish of buffer or MTBR aggregate-treated, Tau-YFP-expressing cells. Full-length Tau Does Not Aggregate Spontaneously in Cells; Truncated Tau Forms Inclusions—To characterize the cellular activities of Tau, we used four different constructs (Fig. 1A). For expression in mammalian cells, we fused either full-length Tau (441 amino acids) or the microtubule-binding region (amino acids 243–375) to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (Tau-YFP and MTBR-YFP). For in vitro Tau fibrillization reactions, we created MTBR Tau with a hemagglutinin tag (MTBR-HA) and untagged MTBR. We expressed Tau-YFP in C17.2 neuronal precursor cells (21Ryder E.F. Snyder E.Y. Cepko C.L. J. Neurobiol. 1990; 21: 356-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) by transient transfection. Tau-YFP co-localized with microtubules (Fig. 1, B and F), as others have reported (22Trinczek B. Biernat J. Baumann K. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1887-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 23King M.E. Kan H.M. Baas P.W. Erisir A. Glabe C.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and did not readily form inclusions. In contrast, MTBR-YFP did not bind microtubules and readily formed inclusions (Fig. 1, C and E) when expressed at a level comparable with Tau-YFP (Fig. 1D). 83% of cells expressing Tau-YFP exhibit co-localization with tubulin, whereas 3.5% of cells expressing MTBR-YFP exhibit co-localization with tubulin (Fig. 1F). Tau Aggregates Enter C17.2 Cells—It has been shown previously that aggregated amyloid proteins amyloid β, prion protein, and expanded polyglutamine can gain entry into cells (24Kanu N. Imokawa Y. Drechsel D.N. Williamson R.A. Birkett C.R. Bostock C.J. Brockes J.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 523-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Yang W. Dunlap J.R.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5207-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Ren P.H. Lauckner J.E. Kachirskaia I. Heuser J.E. Melki R. Kopito R.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested for uptake of recombinant Tau aggregates into C17.2 cells. First, we prepared recombinant MTBR-HA and used arachidonic acid to stimulate its fibrillization, which we detected using AFM (Fig. 2A). We found that these aggregates were completely digested when treated with 0.125% trypsin for 1 min (Fig. 2B). This is 50% of the level of trypsin used to re-plate cells in tissue culture (which are treated for 3 min), indicating relative sensitivity of the extracellular aggregates to proteolysis. To determine whether Tau aggregates were taken into cells, we labeled MTBR Tau monomer and aggregates with AF488. We exposed C17.2 cells to AF488-containing buffer, AF488 conjugated to MTBR monomer, or MTBR aggregates. After 3 and 9 h, we harvested the cells from the plates by treating cells with 0.25% trypsin for 3 min. We quantified AF488 fluorescence using flow cytometry (Fig. 2C). Fluorescence signal due to background uptake of unconjugated AF488 in the buffer was subtracted from all samples. We observed significantly more uptake of aggregates compared with monomer at both time points (Fig. 2C). Direct visualization of these cells before and after trypsinization confirmed the conclusions derived from the flow cytometry experiment, indicating internalization of the aggregated species by the cells (Fig. 2, D and E). Aggregates of extracellularly derived Tau of various sizes were observed in cultured cells. To verify that the Tau present after trypsinization was indeed intracellular, we stained MTBR-AF488 aggregate-treated cells for tubulin and visualized the cells using confocal microscopy. In cells that were treated with aggregates and imaged before trypsinization, both intracellular and extracellular membrane-associated aggregates were observed (data not shown). In trypsin-treated cells, however, the internalized aggregates displaced tubulin (Fig. 2E) and were present in the same plane as tubulin (Fig. 2E, bar), confirming their intracellular locale. Tau Aggregates Enter C17.2 Cells and Co-localize with Dextran—It has been shown previously that exogenously derived amyloid β and prion protein aggregates co-localize with dextran, a marker of fluid-phase endocytosis. Such aggregates did not co-localize with cholera toxin subunit B, a marker of lipid rafts (26Magalhaes A.C. Baron G.S. Lee K.S. Steele-Mortimer O. Dorward D. Prado M.A. Caughey B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5207-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We exposed C17.2 cells to MTBR-AF488 Tau aggregates and dextran. 24% of Tau aggregates co-localized with dextran (n = 3, 200 aggregates counted per experiment) (Fig. 3) but did not co-localize with cholera toxin B (data not shown). This suggests that Tau aggregates enter cells via an endocytic pathway involving engulfment by the cell membrane, rather that the simple penetration of the membrane, as has been proposed previously for other amyloid-forming proteins (28Kayed R. Sokolov Y. Edmonds B. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Hall J.E. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46363-46366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Exogenous Tau Aggregates Induce Aggregation of Intracellular Full-length Tau-YFP—Tau fibrils propagate in vitro via seeded polymerization (29Friedhoff P. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Davies P. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15712-15717Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether extracellular Tau aggregates that enter cells would trigger the misfolding of intracellular Tau-YFP. We transiently transfected HEK293 cells with Tau-YFP. We treated these cells with buffer, MTBR monomer, or MTBR aggregates. After 15 h, cells were harvested and lysed in 1% Triton, and extracts were fractionated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. After SDS-PAGE, Western blot was performed using the Tau5 antibody, which recognizes a motif in the polyproline region of full-length Tau that is not present in the MTBR. Cells treated with aggregates, but not buffer or monomer, contained detergent-insoluble Tau-YFP (Fig. 4A). We repeated this experiment in C17.2 neural cells, including a negative control in which we mixed MTBR aggregates with cell lysate containing Tau-YFP prior to SDS-PAGE to rule out induction of aggregation following lysis (Fig. 4B). To confirm Tau-YFP aggregation in C17.2 cells, detergent-free whole cell lysates were created and resolved by Western blot with the Tau5 antibody. We observed Tau-YFP aggregates at the top of the well when cells were treated with MTBR aggregates but not after buffer or monomer exposure (Fig. 4C). To determine the specificity of aggregate induction, we treated Tau-YFP-expressing cells with aggregates of Huntingtin exon 1 containing 53 glutamines. Exogenous aggregated Huntingtin had no effect on intracellular Tau-YFP aggregation based on Western blot (data not shown). Taken together, these experiments indicated that extracellular Tau aggregates enter cells and induce misfolding of intracellular Tau, but left uncertain whether this was because of a direct association of exogenous and endogenous protein. Thus, we used double label fluorescence confocal microscopy to test for co-localization of exogenous MTBR-HA and endogenous Tau-YFP. After treatment with MTBR-HA aggregates for 15 h and visualization via confocal microscopy, we observed intracellular inclusions consisting of both exogenously and endogenously derived protein, most of which co-localized (Fig. 4D). 74% of aggregates observed were composed of both MTBR-HA and Tau-YFP; 23% of aggregates were composed only of Tau-YFP; and 3% of aggregates were composed only of MTBR-HA (Fig. 4E). Tau-YFP aggregates observed in the absence of MTBR-HA co-localization may arise from self-seeding or may contain MTBR-HA seeds that are too small to detect via immunofluorescence. Extracellular Tau Aggregates Induce Fibrillization of Intracellular Tau-YFP—To rule out the possibility that exogenously derived aggregated Tau caused disordered aggregation of intracellular Tau-YFP, rather than fibrillization, we purified induced Tau-YFP aggregates from cells. We treated C17.2 cells expressing Tau-YFP with buffer or aggregates, and we examined the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction (20Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5827-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) from cell lysates using AFM. No fibrillar material was observed except in cells exposed to exogenous MTBR Tau aggregates (Fig. 5A). To confirm that these fibrils were derived from intracellular full-length Tau-YFP, and not the exogenous MTBR Tau aggregates or other proteins, we used antibody decoration (30DePace A.H. Weissman J.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 389-396PubMed Google Scholar) with the Tau5 antibody. We observed an increase in fibril diameter along the length of the fibrils in Tau5-treated extracts, indicating the purified fibrils were composed of Tau-YFP (Fig. 5B). We next used Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau-YFP purified from C17.2 cells to seed the fibrillization of recombinant MTBR in vitro, confirming the conversion of Tau-YFP to a fibrillar form that is competent to seed aggregation of Tau monomer (Fig. 5C). Antibody decoration of the seeded fibrils using the Tau5 antibody produced isolated densities on the fibrils, confirming the source of the seed as Tau-YFP (Fig. 5D). Thus, exposure to exogenous Tau aggregates induces intracellular Tau-YFP to form fibrils that are competent to seed further aggregation. Intracellular Tau-YFP Aggregates Transfer between Co-cultured Cells—We next tested whether intracellular Tau aggregates transfer between co-cultured cells. We separately transfected cells with either MTBR-YFP or mCherry (a red fluorescent protein variant) and then co-cultured them for 24 h. As a control, we cultured MTBR-YFP and mCherry cells separately and mixed them immediately prior to flow cytometry. Co-cultured cells had significantly more YFP/mCherry dual positive cells (Fig. 6A). Based on four independent experiments, 0.48% of mixed cells (i.e. background) scored as dual-fluorescent versus 1.6% of co-cultured cells (Fig. 6B). Dual positive cells were collected and viewed via fluorescence microscopy. This confirmed the presence of MTBR-YFP inclusions inside cells expressing mCherry (Fig. 6C), indicating that transfer of MTBR-YFP aggregates had occurred. To determine whether the transfer of Tau aggregates between co-cultured cells is inducible, we co-cultured cells expressing full-length Tau-YFP and mCherry and initiated misfolding of Tau-YFP by exposing cells to MTBR Tau aggregates for 48 h (Fig. 7A). Treatment with aggregated species caused Tau-YFP aggregation and transfer of these species to 1% of the mCherry cells (Fig. 7B). We sorted dual positive cells and imaged them with fluorescence microscopy. This confirmed the presence of Tau-YFP inclusions in mCherry-expressing cells (Fig. 7C). Simple cell fusion was unlikely to have occurred at a significant rate, because buffer and monomer treated cells did not score positive. Thus, spontaneously formed MTBR-YFP Tau intracellular inclusions or induced full-length Tau-YFP inclusions spontaneously transfer between co-cultured cells.FIGURE 7Tau-YFP aggregates transfer between co-cultured cells. A, cells were transfected separately with mCherry or Tau-YFP. The two cell populations were either mixed immediately prior to analysis or co-cultured for 48 h. Co-cultured cells were treated with buffer, monomer, or aggregates, followed by flow cytometry (10,000 cells sorted per condition). tx, treatment. B, quantification of flow cytometry revealed that 0.15% of cells score positive for mCherry and YFP (upper right quadrant of cell plot) when cells were mixed immediately prior to counting. 0.3 and 0.25% of cells are dual positive when cells are treated with buffer (B) or monomer (M), versus 1% when treated with Tau aggregates (A), indicating transfer of aggregated full-length Tau-YFP between cells. *, p < 10-7 (unpaired Student's t test, n = 4, 10,000 cells counted per experiment).

Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have tested the hypothesis that aggregated extracellular Tau enters cells and transmits a misfolded state specifically to intracellular Tau. We used recombinant MTBR Tau prepared in vitro to form aggregates, which were readily taken up by cultured cells. Full-length Tau-YFP protein does not readily aggregate within the cell, but internalized aggregates induce its fibrillization. When purified from cells, Tau-YFP is competent to seed the fibrillization of Tau monomer in vitro. Finally, we observed that aggregated intracellular Tau transfers between co-cultured cells. We are uncertain how an aggregate taken into an endocytic vesicle might ultimately gain access to protein located in the cytoplasm, and whether aggregates that transfer from one cell to another are capable of inducing further intracellular aggregation. Aggregate uptake and induced aggregation in neighboring cells was recently suggested by co-culture of polyglutamine-expressing cells, although this study failed to document direct transfer of aggregated protein (27Ren P.H. Lauckner J.E. Kachirskaia I. Heuser J.E. Melki R. Kopito R.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Relatively low efficiencies of cell-to-cell aggregate transfer and extracellular-to-intracellular seeding may make it difficult to document these events in vitro. It is unknown why misfolded amyloid protein accumulates progressively throughout the brain in tauopathy and other neurodegenerative diseases. These data provide a plausible cellular mechanism and are consistent with the hypothesis that Tau aggregates propagate protein misfolding within the brain. Such aggregates could be released from dead or dying cells. Alternatively, they might move between cells via an exocytic process, as has been suggested for prion protein (31Fevrier B. Vilette D. Archer F. Loew D. Faigle W. Vidal M. Laude H. Raposo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9683-9688Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Following uptake by healthy neurons, the aggregates might stimulate further misfolding of an otherwise stable intracellular protein, in the manner of prions. The exocytosis model is more consistent with the observation that spread of Tau pathology traditionally affects networks of neurons that are synaptically connected (8Delacourte A. David J.P. Sergeant N. Buee L. Wattez A. Vermersch P. Ghozali F. Fallet-Bianco C. Pasquier F. Lebert F. Petit H. Di Menza C. Neurology. 1999; 52: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although both mechanisms could act in concert to transfer Tau aggregates between cells. These ideas await testing in vivo.We predict that introduction of exogenous fibrillar protein into the brain of a susceptible animal, like prions, will induce further aggregation of endogenous protein and progressive pathology. We have recently shown that wild-type Tau is capable of conformational diversity that depends on templated conformation change (32Frost B. Ollesch J. Wille H. Diamond M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3546-3551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These data, along with our present study, suggest a mechanism to explain disease-specific cellular vulnerabilities to misfolded protein based on fibrillization rate and propensity for propagation of a given misfolded species. Indeed, splicing variants or post-translational modifications of Tau (e.g. phosphorylation) could render a subgroup of neurons particularly vulnerable to spontaneous or seeded protein misfolding. Thus the propagation of misfolded species through the brain would reflect a combination of neuronal proximity, connectivity, and the particular Tau moieties expressed within the involved regions. Finally, propagation via progressive, templated misfolding suggests a general pathogenic mechanism for other neurodegenerative diseases linked to amyloid protein aggregation.

Diatom productivity south of the Antarctic Polar Front and the subsequent burial of biogenic opal in underlying sediments are limited by this silicon supply. We show that opal burial rates, and thus upwelling, were enhanced during the termination of the last ice age in each sector of the Southern Ocean. In the record with the greatest temporal resolution, we find evidence for two intervals of enhanced upwelling concurrent with the two intervals of rising atmospheric CO 2 during deglaciation.

Classical nucleation theory considers crystal formation to occur from a critical nucleus formed by the assembly of ions from solution. Using cryotransmission electron microscopy, we found that template-directed calcium carbonate formation starts with the formation of prenucleation clusters. Their aggregation leads to the nucleation of amorphous nanoparticles in solution. These nanoparticles assemble at the template and, after reaching a critical size, develop dynamic crystalline domains, one of which is selectively stabilized by the template. Our findings have implications for template-directed mineral formation in biological as well as in synthetic systems."

We report the development of polyurethane networks that exhibit self-repairing characteristics upon exposure to ultraviolet light. The network consists of an oxetane-substituted chitosan precursor incorporated into a two-component polyurethane. Upon mechanical damage of the network, four-member oxetane rings open to create two reactive ends. When exposed to ultraviolet light, chitosan chain scission occurs, which forms crosslinks with the reactive oxetane ends, thus repairing the network.

https://openalex.org/W2093398004,"Separate studies have implicated the lateral habenula (LHb) or amygdala-related regions in processing aversive stimuli, but their relationships to each other and to appetitive motivational systems are poorly understood. We show that neurons in the recently identified GABAergic rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which receive a major LHb input, project heavily to midbrain dopamine neurons, and show phasic activations and/or Fos induction after aversive stimuli (footshocks, shock-predictive cues, food deprivation, or reward omission) and inhibitions after rewards or reward-predictive stimuli. RMTg lesions markedly reduce passive fear behaviors (freezing, open-arm avoidance) dependent on the extended amygdala, periaqueductal gray, or septum, all regions that project directly to the RMTg. In contrast, RMTg lesions spare or enhance active fear responses (treading, escape) in these same paradigms. These findings suggest that aversive inputs from widespread brain regions and stimulus modalities converge onto the RMTg, which opposes reward and motor-activating functions of midbrain dopamine neurons."

However, identifying the precise neurons supporting a given memory (the memory trace) has been a long-standing challenge. We have shown previously that lateral amygdala (LA) neurons with increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element–binding protein (CREB) are preferentially activated by fear memory expression, which suggests that they are selectively recruited into the memory trace. We used an inducible diphtheria-toxin strategy to specifically ablate these neurons. Selectively deleting neurons overexpressing CREB (but not a similar portion of random LA neurons) after learning blocked expression of that fear memory. The resulting memory loss was robust and persistent, which suggests that the memory was permanently erased.

These results suggest a prevalence of LRR domain proteins in trans-synaptic signaling and provide a cellular basis for the reported linkage of LRRTM1 to handedness and schizophrenia. Chemical synapses represent the principal means of communication between neurons. While significant progress has been made in determining the developmental signals that guide axons to their targets, the molecular mechanisms that determine the final establishment of circuits remain incompletely understood. Synapses are asymmetric cellular junctions composed of a presynaptic vesicle release site, a synaptic cleft, and a specialized postsynaptic receptive apparatus. A major challenge in elucidating the mechanisms that govern synapse formation and maturation is the enormous variety of synapse types in the mammalian brain. It is likely that this diversity requires contribution from a large number of molecular signals. In addition to neuronal transmembrane proteins, secreted factors such as FGFs and neuronal pentraxins, and glial-derived factors such as thrombospondin and complement cascade proteins shape synapse development (Stevens et al., 2007Stevens B.

Given the potential for a trans-synaptic interaction that could bridge the presynaptic release apparatus with the postsynaptic density, Scheiffele and colleagues tested whether neuroligin expressed in transfected HEK cells could assemble presynaptic terminals when cocultured with axons from pontine explants. Indeed, expression of neuroligin in HEK cells induced the clustering of synaptic vesicles in contacting axons (Scheiffele et al., 2000Scheiffele P. Fan J. Choih J. Fetter R. Serafini T. Neuroligin expressed in nonneuronal cells triggers presynaptic development in contacting axons.Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), via direct interaction with neurexins. In a parallel fashion, expression of β-neurexin in COS cells induces postsynaptic differentiation in contacting dendrites (Graf et al., 2004Graf E.R. Zhang X. Jin S.X. Linhoff M.W. Craig A.M.

Evidence is accumulating that proteins testing positive for synaptogenic activity in this assay may not be essential for initiating the formation of or maintaining the integrity of synaptic junctions. Rather, these factors may serve a role in the maturation of the synapse, recruiting components necessary for synaptic function. Here we used the fibroblast-neuron coculture assay to search for novel synaptogenic proteins. We created and screened a set of full-length size-selected cDNA expression libraries from developing rat brain. Screening to date reveals a prevalence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) synaptogenic proteins arising from this unbiased approach. We identify the leucine rich repeat transmembrane neuronal (LRRTM) protein family as able to instruct excitatory presynaptic differentiation and to mediate postsynaptic differentiation. Furthermore, we generate an LRRTM1 knockout mouse and reveal a modest synaptic phenotype, suggesting a synaptic basis for the recently reported linkage of LRRTM1 to handedness and schizophrenia (Francks et al., 2007Francks C. Maegawa S. Lauren J. Abrahams B.S. Velayos-Baeza A. Medland S.E. Colella S. Groszer M. McAuley E.Z. Caffrey T.M. et al.LRRTM1 on chromosome 2p12 is a maternally suppressed gene that is associated paternally with handedness and schizophrenia.Mol. Psychiatry. 2007; 12 (1057): 1129-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Parts of this work have previously been published in doctoral dissertations (Linhoff, 2008Linhoff M.W. Expression Screening for Proteins Involved in CNS Presynaptic Differentiation and Initial Characterization of the Synaptogenic LRRTM Protein Family. Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis2008Google Scholar, Lauren, 2007Lauren J. Characterization of LRRTM and NGR Gene Families: Expression and Functions. Helsinki University Printing House, Helsinki2007Google Scholar). To test the feasibility of converting the fibroblast-neuron coculture assay into an expression screen, neuroligin-1 and neuroligin-2 cDNAs were diluted up to 1:1000 with either a soluble CFP expression plasmid or a pool of inactive cDNAs. Neuroligin-2 could be diluted 500-fold while still consistently yielding a positive synaptogenic signal on a single neuron-COS cell coculture coverslip, while neuroligin-1 could only be diluted 100-fold (data not shown). Thus, a pool size of ∼250 clones would be likely to yield novel clones with synaptogenic activity of similar potency as neuroligins. This pool size of 250 is considerably smaller than typical pool sizes of 1,000 - 10,000 used for expression screens involving more sensitive detection technologies (e.g., Fournier et al., 2001Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Identification of a receptor mediating Nogo-66 inhibition of axonal regeneration.Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since we are expecting active proteins to be transmembrane or secreted, positive clones would have to be full-length to contain the signal peptide essential for proper trafficking. Thus, the first step in the screen was to generate an unamplified cDNA expression library with a high percentage of full-length clones (Figure 1A). We isolated mRNA from rat forebrain at P11, the peak of synaptogenesis (Micheva and Beaulieu, 1996Micheva K.D. Beaulieu C. Quantitative aspects of synaptogenesis in the rat barrel field cortex with special reference to GABA circuitry.J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 373: 340-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To ensure representation of full-length molecules, we used the biotinylated cap-trapper method that had been developed for large-scale sequencing projects (Figures S1A and S1B) (Carninci et al., 1996Carninci P. Kvam C. Kitamura A. Ohsumi T. Okazaki Y. Itoh M. Kamiya M. Shibata K. Sasaki N. Izawa M. et al.High-efficiency full-length cDNA cloning by biotinylated CAP trapper.Genomics. 1996; 37: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The resultant cap-trapped cDNA was subjected to rigorous size fractionation, and individual unamplified libraries were maintained. Mean insert size of the resultant libraries was confirmed by restriction digestion (Figure S1C), and sequencing of over 50 clones indicated that all contained the 5′ ATG. We were successful in creating high-quality expression libraries for inserts up to 5 kb using pcDNA3.1 as the host expression vector (Figure 1A). Figure 1B illustrates the protocol that we used for the screen to identify cDNA pools that contained synaptogenic activity. Synaptogenic activity was assayed by the immunocytochemical detection of experimentally induced hemisynapses. The cocultures were immunostained with synapsin I antibody to detect synaptic vesicle clustering at contact sites between COS cells and axons. Coimmunostaining for the postsynaptic markers PSD-95 family and gephyrin ensured that synapsin immunoreactivity associated with bona fide interneuronal synapses was not counted as a false positive. A cDNA pool was considered positive if it generated any COS cell with significant associated synapsin clusters unapposed to PSD-95 family or gephyrin. We screened positive cDNA pools using PCR to detect known synaptogenic factors. The first positive pool, PD026, was found in the 4–5 kb library, tested positive for neuroligin-2 using PCR, and was not fractionated to isolate the single responsible synaptogenic cDNA. Further screening within the 3–4 kb library resulted in another positive pool, PC064, which tested PCR negative for neuroligins. We subdivided the PC064 cDNA pool to isolate the synaptogenic clone. Generation of arrayed clones and DNA from a positive subpool aided in identifying the active clone. The isolated clone, PC064-89-29-40 (pool PC064, subpool 89, subpool 29, clone 40), was identified as leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein LRRTM1. The LRRTM protein family consists of four members, each possessing ten extracellular leucine-rich repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and an ∼70 amino acid cytoplasmic domain (Figures 1B and S2) (Lauren et al., 2003Lauren J. Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. Timmusk T. A novel gene family encoding leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins differentially expressed in the nervous system.Genomics. 2003; 81: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We cloned each of the LRRTM family members from rat cDNA, fused CFP to the C terminus, and tested each protein for synaptogenic activity in the coculture assay. N-cadherin has been shown previously to not induce presynaptic clustering (Scheiffele et al., 2000Scheiffele P. Fan J. Choih J. Fetter R. Serafini T. Neuroligin expressed in nonneuronal cells triggers presynaptic development in contacting axons.Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar); we confirmed this (see below) and used N-cadherin as a negative control. As an additional control, we used the LRR protein, AMIGO, which has been shown to interact with the axons of hippocampal neurons and induce neurite outgrowth and fasciculation (Kuja-Panula et al., 2003Kuja-Panula J. Kiiltomaki M. Yamashiro T. Rouhiainen A. Rauvala H. AMIGO, a transmembrane protein implicated in axon tract development, defines a novel protein family with leucine-rich repeats.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To obtain a quantitative measure of each protein's ability to instruct presynaptic differentiation, we measured the amount of synapsin clustering associated with transfected COS cells and not associated with MAP2-positive dendrites to exclude interneuronal synapses. Robust synaptogenic activity was observed for LRRTM1-CFP, LRRTM2-CFP, LRRTM4-CFP, and neuroligin-2-CFP (Figures 2A, 2B, and S3B). In some instances clustering of the CFP fusion protein could be observed apposed to synapsin puncta (Figures 2A and 2B, insets). LRRTM3-CFP consistently yielded limited activity in the coculture assay (Figure S3A). In contrast to the LRRTMs, synaptogenic activity was not observed for N-cadherin-CFP or the LRR-containing AMIGO-CFP (see Figure 2C for images of AMIGO-CFP). LRRTM1-CFP, LRRTM2-CFP, LRRTM4-CFP, and neuroligin-2-CFP each induced a >14-fold increase in synapsin clustering when compared to results obtained from N-cadherin-CFP or AMIGO-CFP-transfected cells (Figure 2D, n = 20 transfected COS cells per construct; ANOVA p < 0.0001; t test versus N-cadherin-CFP and AMIGO-CFP p < 0.005). In contrast, synapsin clustering associated with LRRTM3-CFP was 1.6- to 3.3-fold above that associated with N-cadherin-CFP or AMIGO-CFP (t test versus N-cadherin and AMIGO p < 0.05). In separate experiments to confirm the lack of presynaptic inducing activity of N-cadherin compared with no surface protein expression, we compared the percentage of cells exhibiting any clusters of synapsin not associated with PSD-95 or gephyrin for COS cells expressing N-cadherin-CFP (1.6% ± 0.3%) or expressing CFP (1.8% ± 0.5%; p > 0.1). Axonal contact area determined from dephospho-tau immunoreactivity was also higher for LRRTM2-CFP, LRRTM4-CFP, and neuroligin-2-CFP than for N-cadherin-CFP or AMIGO-CFP (Figure S3C; ANOVA p < 0.0001), suggesting an effect on axon adhesion as well as presynaptic differentiation. The less than 2-fold increase in axon contact area for LRRTM2-CFP or LRRTM4-CFP was not sufficient to explain the >14-fold increase in synapsin clustering, indicating a direct presynaptic effect. Thus, measures of synapsin area normalized per axon contact area also revealed significant induction of presynaptic differentiation by LRRTMs (Figure 2E). Although the most synaptogenic factors tended to have increased axon contact area, the same phenomenon did not hold true for LRRTM1-CFP. This result is likely due to the reduced surface expression of LRRTM1 relative to the other family members. We observed that LRRTM1 accumulates extensively in the endoplasmic reticulum of transfected nonneuronal cells (data not shown), and this result has been observed previously (Francks et al., 2007Francks C. Maegawa S. Lauren J. Abrahams B.S. Velayos-Baeza A. Medland S.E. Colella S. Groszer M. McAuley E.Z. Caffrey T.M. et al.LRRTM1 on chromosome 2p12 is a maternally suppressed gene that is associated paternally with handedness and schizophrenia.Mol. Psychiatry. 2007; 12 (1057): 1129-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Since synapsin is a vesicle-associated protein, we also tested for other markers of presynaptic differentiation. LRRTMs induced clustering of the active zone cytomatrix protein bassoon (Figures S4A–S4D), as well as the integral synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptophysin (Figures S4E–S4H). We tested whether the synaptogenic activity was restricted to excitatory or inhibitory presynaptic differentiation. The CFP fusion proteins were scored blind for significant clustering of the presynaptic vesicular neurotransmitter transporters, VGLUT1 and VGAT, to identify excitatory or inhibitory presynaptic differentiation, respectively. Significant clustering of VGLUT1 unapposed to PSD-95 family was observed for LRRTM1-CFP, LRRTM2-CFP, LRRTM3-CFP, LRRTM4-CFP, and neuroligin-2-CFP (Figures 2F–2J; ANOVA p < 0.0001; t test versus N-cadherin-CFP and AMIGO-CFP p < 0.0005). In contrast, only LRRTM2-CFP and neuroligin-2 showed robust clustering of VGAT unapposed to gephyrin (Figures S3D–S3F; ANOVA p < 0.0001). Since LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 demonstrated the most potent synaptogenic activity of the four family members, we focused further efforts on these two family members. To test whether the induced presynaptic clusters were functional for release, we used whole-cell patch voltage clamp to record currents from HEK293T cells cotransfected with LRRTM2-CFP and NMDA receptor subunits YFP-NR1 and NR2A and cocultured with hippocampal neurons. A similar assay was used to show that neuroligin-1 coexpressed with NMDA receptors could induce excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC)-like events in HEK cells cocultured with cerebellar granule neurons (Fu et al., 2003Fu Z. Washbourne P. Ortinski P. Vicini S. Functional excitatory synapses in HEK293 cells expressing neuroligin and glutamate receptors.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 3950-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, bursts of spontaneous activity much like NMDA receptor currents typical of cultured neurons were recorded from the HEK293T cells expressing LRRTM2-CFP and NMDA receptors (Figure 3A). These bursts of high-amplitude events were abolished by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and reduced to miniature EPSC-like events, indicating that the bursts arise from action-potential-dependent neuronal network activity that drives glutamate release onto the transfected cell. In contrast, HEK293T cells cotransfected with YFP-NR1, NR2A, and N-cadherin-CFP as a negative control exhibited only rare spontaneous events and lacked the bursting activity observed for LRRTM2-CFP-expressing cells (Figure 3B). These rare synaptic-like events may correspond to fusion of immature synaptic vesicles or may arise from orphan release sites of axons (Krueger et al., 2003Krueger S.R. Kolar A. Fitzsimonds R.M. The presynaptic release apparatus is functional in the absence of dendritic contact and highly mobile within isolated axons.Neuron. 2003; 40: 945-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The frequency and amplitude of events onto N-cadherin-expressing cells was not significantly altered by TTX. Amplitude of events onto LRRTM2-CFP-expressing cells was reduced 4.6-fold by TTX (n = 5 cells with frequency >0.1 Hz), indicating the formation of multiple functional release sites. Quantitative analysis confirmed a greater than 20-fold overall increase in frequency of spontaneous EPSC-like events and 6.6-fold increase in frequency of miniature EPSC-like events in HEK293T cells expressing LRRTM2-CFP compared with N-cadherin-CFP-expressing cells (Figure 3C; n ≥ 10, p < 0.005 t test). The amplitude of spontaneous but not miniature events was also significantly increased for LRRTM2-CFP versus N-cadherin-CFP-expressing cells (Figure 3D; p < 0.05 t test comparison of mean cell values). Mean amplitude of miniature events was 89 and 99 pA for N-cadherin or LRRTM2-CFP-expressing cells, respectively, suggesting that sufficient levels of diffuse surface NMDA receptors were obtained in the HEK cells to provide a sensitive assay of release. All synaptic-like events were abolished by NMDA receptor antagonist APV (data not shown). Thus, the presynaptic specializations induced by LRRTM2 expression are functional with respect to evoked and spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic vesicle exocytosis. To determine if the LRR domain was necessary for synaptogenic activity, a deletion mutant lacking the LRR domain, ΔLRR-LRRTM2-CFP, was tested in the coculture assay. The deletion mutant was expressed on the cell surface, but presynaptic differentiation was not observed in axons that contacted the surface of transfected COS cells (Figure S5). To determine whether the LRR domain of LRRTM2 is sufficient to instruct presynaptic differentiation, a fusion protein of the LRR domain of LRRTM2 with a myc-epitope tagged placental alkaline phosphatase (AP), LRRTM2 LRR-AP, was linked via biotinylated anti-myc antibody onto neutravidin beads. Contact of these LRR-AP-coated beads with isolated axons of hippocampal neurons induced clustering of synapsin or VGLUT1 at contact sites (Figures 4A and 4B, right panels). Beads coated with the control AP protein did not display synaptogenic activity (Figures 4A and 4B, left panels). Random counts revealed synapsin clustering at 34.1% of LRR-AP bead contacts and only 2.1% of control AP bead contacts (n = 50 fields). The mean synapsin intensity under all LRR-AP beads was 6.3-fold higher than that under control AP beads (p < 0.0001). Clustering of the active zone marker bassoon could also be detected at LRR-AP bead-axon contact sites. In fact, there appeared to be separation between the bassoon-labeled active zone and the VGLUT1-positive vesicle pool, with the active zone most closely apposed to the bead surface (Figure 4B, right panel, inset). The LRR-AP beads did not appear to cluster VGAT at contact sites with GAD-positive axons (data not shown). These results show that the LRR domain of LRRTM2 is necessary and sufficient to induce excitatory presynaptic differentiation without any contribution from other factors. To begin to assess subcellular localization, we created extracellular YFP fusions of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 and transfected hippocampal neurons in culture. YFP-LRRTM-1 or -2 expressed at low level in hippocampal neurons traffic to dendrites and assume a punctate, synaptic-like pattern (Figures 5A–5C). YFP-LRRTM-1 or -2 colocalized with PSD-95 family proteins opposite VGLUT1 puncta. YFP-LRRTM-1 and -2 appeared to be exclusively colocalized with the excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding proteins of the PSD-95 family but not with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin. Quantitation of thresholded puncta revealed 72.6% overlap of YFP-LRRTM2 puncta with PSD-95 family, compared with 4.5% overlap of mirror images as control, and 8.0% overlap with gephyrin. These results suggest that the function of LRRTMs may be restricted to glutamatergic and not GABAergic hippocampal synapses, although more definitive tests and more diverse contexts are required. The C terminus of all four LRRTM members ends in a pattern of residues (-E-C-E-V) that resembles the X-S/T-X-V Class I PDZ domain ligand pattern (Sheng and Sala, 2001Sheng M. Sala C. PDZ domains and the organization of supramolecular complexes.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a glutamate at the −3 position is preferred for PDZ domains 1 and 2 of PSD-95, for which several natural ligands terminate in -E-S/T-D-V (Sheng and Sala, 2001Sheng M. Sala C. PDZ domains and the organization of supramolecular complexes.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Although a cysteine has not been reported in the −2 position for PDZ domain ligands, the similarity prompted us to test whether LRRTMs might bind PSD-95. We tested whether YFP-LRRTM2 could colocalize with PSD-95 in COS cells. YFP-LRRTM2 frequently forms small clusters in transfected COS cells. When PSD-95-mRFP was cotransfected with YFP-LRRTM2, the two proteins colocalized precisely in larger discrete aggregates (Figure 5D). Similar coclustering has been observed for coexpressed PSD-95 and other ligands and is thought to reflect the formation of large complexes via multimerization of PSD-95 and binding to ligand. Deletion of the C-terminal E-C-E-V residues of YFP-LRRTM2 disrupted the colocalization with PSD-95 (Figure 5E). We also confirmed the interaction by coimmunoprecipitation of myc-tagged PSD-95 with YFP-LRRTM2 coexpressed in COS cells (Figure 5F). Again, delet"

Here, we show that the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)/Pelle-like kinase gene SHORT SUSPENSOR (SSP) regulates this pathway through a previously unknown parent-of-origin effect. SSP transcripts are produced in mature pollen but do not appear to be translated. Instead, they are delivered via the sperm cells to the zygote and the endosperm, where SSP protein transiently accumulates. Ectopic expression of SSP protein in the leaf epidermis is sufficient to activate YDA-dependent signaling. We propose that SSP protein produced from paternal transcripts upon fertilization triggers zygotic YDA activity, providing an essential temporal cue for the regulation of the asymmetric first division."
https://openalex.org/W2040382032,"The study of human learning is complicated by the myriad of processing elements involved in conducting any behavioral task. In the case of visual perceptual learning, there has been significant controversy regarding the task processes that guide the formation of this learning. However, there is a developing consensus that top-down, task-related factors are required for such learning to take place. Here we challenge this idea by use of a novel procedure in which human participants, who were deprived of food and water, passively viewed visual stimuli while receiving occasional drops of water as rewards. Visual orientation stimuli, which were temporally paired with the liquid rewards, were viewed monocularly and rendered imperceptible by continuously flashing contour-rich patterns to the other eye. Results show that visual learning can be formed in human adults through stimulus-reward pairing in the absence of a task and without awareness of the stimulus presentation or reward contingencies."

Here we establish a global climatology of inverse visibilities over land from 1973 to 2007 and interpret it in terms of changes in aerosol optical depth and the consequent impacts on incident solar radiation. The aerosol contribution to “global dimming,” first reported in terms of strong decreases in measured incident solar radiation up to the mid-1980s, has monotonically increased over the period analyzed. Since that time, visibility has increased over Europe, consistent with reported European “brightening,” but has decreased substantially over south and east Asia, South America, Australia, and Africa, resulting in net global dimming over land."

https://openalex.org/W1966049079,"Migraine is a common disabling brain disorder. A subtype of migraine with aura (familial hemiplegic migraine type 1: FHM1) is caused by mutations in Ca(V)2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca(2+) channels. Knockin mice carrying a FHM1 mutation show increased neuronal P/Q-type current and facilitation of induction and propagation of cortical spreading depression (CSD), the phenomenon that underlies migraine aura and may activate migraine headache mechanisms. We studied cortical neurotransmission in neuronal microcultures and brain slices of FHM1 mice. We show gain of function of excitatory neurotransmission due to increased action-potential-evoked Ca(2+) influx and increased probability of glutamate release at pyramidal cell synapses but unaltered inhibitory neurotransmission at fast-spiking interneuron synapses. Using an in vitro model of CSD, we show a causative link between enhanced glutamate release and CSD facilitation. The synapse-specific effect of FHM1 mutations points to disruption of excitation-inhibition balance and neuronal hyperactivity as the basis for episodic vulnerability to CSD ignition in migraine."
https://openalex.org/W2094254209,"Halogen bonding has increasingly facilitated the assembly of diverse host-guest solids. Here, we show that a well-known class of organic salts, bis(trimethylammonium) alkane diiodides, can reversibly encapsulate α,ω-diiodoperfluoroalkanes (DIPFAs) through intermolecular interactions between the host's I – anions and the guest's terminal iodine substituents. The process is highly selective for the fluorocarbon that forms an I – ···I(CF 2 ) m I···I – superanion that is matched in length to the chosen dication. DIPFAs that are 2 to 12 carbons in length (common industrial intermediates) can thereby be isolated from mixtures by means of crystallization from solution upon addition of the dissolved size-matched ionic salt. The solid-state salts can also selectively capture the DIPFAs from the vapor phase, yielding the same product formed from solution despite a lack of porosity of the starting lattice structure. Heating liberates the DIPFAs and regenerates the original salt lattice, highlighting the practical potential for the system in separation applications."

The complex genetic structure of natural variation poses challenges for gene identification: most traits are thought to be affected by a few polymorphic genes with moderate effects, and many genes with small effects (Flint, 2003Flint J.

A molecular understanding of multigenic traits is essential to determine how genetic changes arise, what genes they affect, how these genes interact, and how they influence behavior. A common approach used to dissect complex genetic traits is QTL analysis, in which two strains are intercrossed, F2 progeny or inbred lines of progeny are characterized by genotype and phenotype, and quantitative genetics is used to find linkage to traits of interest. Classical QTL analysis has associated chromosomal regions with traits like anxiety, aggression, drug preference, and learning, but since a well-defined QTL in Drosophila or mouse typically covers 300–500 genes, moving from a QTL to the causative mutation is very difficult (Mackay, 2004Mackay T.F. The genetic architecture of quantitative traits: lessons from Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Mott and Flint, 2008Mott R. Flint J.

Analysis of quantitative trait loci that influence animal behavior.J. Neurobiol. 2003; 54: 46-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Indeed, the association of the G protein regulator Rgs2 with anxiety may be the only established single-gene behavioral QTL in mice (Yalcin et al., 2004Yalcin B. Fullerton J. Miller S. Keays D.A. Brady S. Bhomra A. Jefferson A. Volpi E. Copley R.R. Flint J. Mott R. Genetic dissection of a behavioral quantitative trait locus shows that Rgs2 modulates anxiety in mice.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Developing methods to address the QTL-to-genetic-alteration problem is a major goal of the field. For example, new methods of interest combine QTL analysis with complementary approaches such as gene expression analysis or association studies of outbred strains (Mackay, 2004Mackay T.F. The genetic architecture of quantitative traits: lessons from Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2008Wang L. Dankert H.

The resolution of QTL mapping has been greatly improved by whole-genome sequences and inexpensive resequencing, which allow strains to be genotyped at thousands of polymorphic loci. To take advantage of these high-resolution DNA maps, it is optimal to have chromosomes with many recombination breakpoints for fine genetic mapping. Recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines, or RIAILs, are modified inbred lines with many crossover points per chromosome that should allow rapid mapping of QTLs to individual genes (Darvasi and Soller, 1995Darvasi A. Soller M. Advanced intercross lines, an experimental population for fine genetic mapping.Genetics. 1995; 141: 1199-1207PubMed Google Scholar, Rockman and Kruglyak, 2008Rockman M.V. Kruglyak L. Breeding designs for recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines.Genetics. 2008; 179: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A set of high-resolution C. elegans RIAILs has been generated by intercrossing the standard laboratory strain (N2) with a strain isolated in a Hawaiian pineapple field (CB4856, henceforth “HW”) for ten generations, inbred by selfing for ten generations, and genotyped at 1455 loci (Rockman and Kruglyak, 2009Rockman M.V. Kruglyak L. Recombinational landscape and population genomics of C. elegans.PLoS Genet. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar).

Here we use the RIAILs to identify two QTLs that affect a behavioral trait, and map both QTLs to single genetic changes. C. elegans has strong behavioral responses to the gases O2 and CO2, which are highly variable in its natural soil and compost environments due to metabolic activity (Sylvia et al., 1998Sylvia D.M.

HW has a low-activity npr-1 allele (215 phenylalanine) and as a result strongly avoids high O2 levels on food and is not repelled by CO2. Two other behaviors observed in HW strains, aggregation into feeding groups and accumulation at the border of a bacterial lawn, are in part caused by avoidance of high O2 conditions (Gray et al., 2004Gray J.M.

Using QTL mapping, we find that npr-1 cooperates with another variable gene, the globin homolog glb-5, to affect behavioral responses to O2 and CO2. Using genetic studies of 203 wild strains, we trace the history of these mutations in C. elegans. C. elegans increases its frequency of spontaneous reversals and high-amplitude turns when exposed to repulsive stimuli and suppresses reversals and turns when exposed to attractants (Chalasani et al., 2007Chalasani S.H. Chronis N. Tsunozaki M. Gray J.M. Ramot D. Goodman M.B. Bargmann C.I.

Thermotaxis in Caenorhabditis elegans analyzed by measuring responses to defined thermal stimuli.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5727-5733PubMed Google Scholar). To learn more about O2 and CO2 responses of C. elegans, we scored turning behaviors (Figure 1A) in freely moving adult animals on a thin lawn of OP50 bacteria, while switching the chamber between two different gas mixtures every 3 min for 60 min (Figure 1B). Video recordings were analyzed using automated tracking software that recorded instantaneous speed, reversals, and turns (Ramot et al., 2008Ramot D. Johnson B.E. Berry Jr., T.L. Carnell L. Goodman M.B. The Parallel Worm Tracker: a platform for measuring average speed and drug-induced paralysis in nematodes.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We focused on omega turns, which are high-amplitude forward turns that reorient movement by >90°. Strikingly, N2 and HW hermaphrodites, both nominally wild-type, had opposite turning responses to simultaneous changes in CO2 and O2 concentrations (Figures 1C and 1D). When N2 animals were shifted from a mixture of 21%O2/79%N2 to 1%CO2/20%O2/79%N2, they generated a burst of turns that peaked after ∼30 s and fell to baseline ∼60 s later (Figures 1C and 1E). The reciprocal switch back to 21%O2/79%N2 suppressed turning. By contrast, HW animals shifted from 21%O2/79%N2 to 1%CO2/20%O2/79%N2 suppressed turning, and the reciprocal switch back to 21%O2/79%N2 caused a burst of turning that peaked after ∼30 s and fell to baseline ∼60 s later (Figures 1D and 1E). Since transient bursts of turning accompany the appearance of a repellent, these results suggest that HW and N2 have opposite preferences for the two gas mixtures. To determine which gas was most important for turning behavior, CO2 and O2 levels were changed separately. Upon a shift from 0% to 1% CO2, N2 responded with a burst of turning but HW did not respond; a reciprocal shift from 1% to 0% CO2 had no effect on N2, but stimulated turning slightly in HW (Figures 1C–1E). These results suggest that N2 avoids CO2 and that HW is weakly attracted to CO2. A shift from 21% to 20% O2, or from 20% to 21% O2, had little effect on turning in N2 (Figures 1C and 1E). By contrast, HW showed a transient 2-fold increase in turning upon a 20% to 21% O2 upshift and reduced turning upon the reciprocal O2 downshift, suggesting a preference for 20% O2 (Figures 1D and 1E). Quantitative analysis of the behaviors revealed significant interactions between the gas responses (Tables S1 and S2 available online). The N2 turning response in the mixture was dominated by CO2 and was consistent with the known avoidance of CO2 by N2 (Bretscher et al., 2008Bretscher A.J. Busch K.E. de Bono M. A carbon dioxide avoidance behavior is integrated with responses to ambient oxygen and food in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 8044-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, Hallem and Sternberg, 2008Hallem E.A. Sternberg P.W. Acute carbon dioxide avoidance in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 8038-8043Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The turning response in HW was dominated by a preference for 20% over 21% O2 and was significantly stronger when both CO2 and O2 were changed simultaneously, suggesting a slight attraction to CO2 and an interaction between the responses. The genetic basis of the behavioral response to simultaneous changes in O2 and CO2 was determined by characterizing 78 RIAILs (Figure 1F). Based on their turning behaviors, the RIAILs fell into a nearly continuous distribution with three general groups: (1) HW-like lines that turned upon simultaneous O2 increases/CO2 decreases and suppressed turning upon simultaneous O2 decreases/CO2 increases; (2) N2-like lines that turned upon O2 decreases/CO2 increases and suppressed turning upon O2 increases/CO2 decreases; (3) intermediate lines that did not turn much in response to either change. The continuous distribution of phenotypes and the existence of a novel intermediate behavioral class indicate that this is a complex genetic trait, i.e., that multiple loci influence the behavior. To identify loci that contribute to the behaviors of the RIAILs, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed on the O2 increase/CO2 decrease response and on the O2 decrease/CO2 increase response using genotypes of the RIAILs at 1455 SNP markers. Both analyses identified two significant QTLs (Figure 1G), one QTL on chromosome V (lod scores 6.5 and 6.6 for the O2 decrease/CO2 increase and O2 increase/CO2 decrease, respectively, genome-wide corrected p < 0.0001 each) and one QTL on chromosome X (lod scores 7.0 and 5.2, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0003 for the O2 decrease/CO2 increase and O2 increase/CO2 decrease, respectively). For the O2 decrease/CO2 increase response, the two QTLs account for 79% of the among-line variance, explaining 33% (V) and 45% (X) of the variance with no significant interaction between them (F1 = 3.87, p = 0.053). For the O2 increase/CO2 decrease response, the main effects of the two loci explain 34% (V) and 35% (X) of the variance, and a significant interaction effect between the two loci accounts for 15% of the among-line variance (F1 = 63, p < 10−10; see Experimental Procedures for further discussion). The genotypes of the two loci on V and X in the 78 RIAILs correlated with the three behavioral classes noted above (Figure 1F). Although the behavioral scores appeared to fall in a continuous distribution, most RIAILs that had N2 alleles of both QTLs behaved like N2 (n = 33), and most RIAILs with HW alleles of both QTLs behaved like HW (n = 13). RIAILs with N2 alleles at one locus and HW alleles at the other had weak responses to either O2/CO2 step change (n = 32) (Figure 1F). To further analyze the mixed allele strains, HW alleles of both QTLs were individually introgressed into N2 by extensive backcrossing, yielding one strain with nearly pure N2 DNA except for the QTL region on chromosome V (referred to as VQTL:HW), one strain with nearly pure N2 DNA except for the QTL region on chromosome X (referred to as XQTL:HW), and one strain with nearly pure N2 DNA with both V and X QTLs from HW (referred to as VQTL:HW; XQTL:HW) (Figure 1H). The three strains were then tested for turning responses to O2 step changes, CO2 step changes, and combined O2/CO2 step changes (Figures 1I–1K and S1). In all three conditions, VQTL:HW; XQTL:HW were indistinguishable from HW, confirming that two discrete loci account for most of HW behavior (Figure 1K). The VQTL:HW and XQTL:HW strains with one HW locus were distinguishable from each other and from both starting strains. XQTL:HW had minimal responses in all six step changes (Figure 1J). VQTL:HW increased turns in response to individual CO2 increases but did not respond when these were paired with O2 decreases (Figure 1I). The QTL on chromosome X spans the region from 4 to 5.25 Mb, centered on the npr-1 gene. The high-activity npr-1(215V) allele is required for CO2 avoidance by N2 (Bretscher et al., 2008Bretscher A.J. Busch K.E. de Bono M. A carbon dioxide avoidance behavior is integrated with responses to ambient oxygen and food in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 8044-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, Hallem and Sternberg, 2008Hallem E.A. Sternberg P.W. Acute carbon dioxide avoidance in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 8038-8043Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); since HW animals have the low-activity npr-1(215F) allele, an npr-1 contribution was a plausible explanation for the QTL on X. To test this possibility, a plasmid containing the high-activity N2 npr-1(215V) allele was injected into XQTL:HW animals. The resulting transgenic animals behaved like N2 (Figures 2A and S1), indicating that expression of the N2 allele of npr-1 is sufficient for N2-like turning behavior in XQTL:HW animals. Injecting a comparable low-activity HW npr-1(215F) plasmid did not affect the behavior of XQTL:HW animals (Figures 2A and S1). Animals bearing the EMS-induced npr-1(ad609) loss-of-function mutant in an N2 background behaved like XQTL::HW animals (Figure 2A), confirming the importance of npr-1 in the turning assay. These results indicate that variation in the npr-1 coding sequence can explain the QTL for CO2 and O2 behavior on the X chromosome. The QTL on chromosome V was bounded by markers at 5.46 and 5.62 Mb, a region of 160 kb. Nine RIAILs had breakpoints between these markers, and finer breakpoint mapping of these strains narrowed the region to 90 kb, or 19 genes. Two interesting candidates in this interval, glb-5 and glb-6, are predicted to encode proteins with globin domains that can potentially bind O2 and CO2 (Hoogewijs et al., 2008Hoogewijs D. De Henau S. Dewilde S. Moens L. Couvreur M. Borgonie G. Vinogradov S.N. Roy S.W. Vanfleteren J.R. The Caenorhabditis globin gene family reveals extensive nematode-specific radiation and diversification.BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 279Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The sequence of the coding region of glb-6 was identical between N2 and HW, but the genomic sequence of glb-5 contained a 765 bp duplication/insertion in N2 compared to HW (Figure 2B). glb-5 cDNA analysis demonstrated that the DNA polymorphism resulted in substantially different mRNAs and predicted GLB-5 proteins in N2 and HW. The duplicated exon in N2 led to an in-frame stop codon in the glb-5 cDNA, resulting in a truncation of the last 179 amino acids of the protein compared to HW, and the inclusion of 40 different residues (Figure 2B). To ask whether glb-5 regulates O2/CO2 responses, we first tested heterozygous offspring of VQTL:HW; XQTL:HW and XQTL:HW animals to determine which allele of the QTL on V was dominant when npr-1 genotype was held constant. These offspring behaved like VQTL:HW; XQTL:HW (Figure 2A), indicating that the HW variant on chromosome V was dominant. To ask whether the QTL corresponded to glb-5, a glb-5 cDNA encoding the HW allele of glb-5 driven by its own promoter was injected into XQTL:HW animals. The resulting transgenic animals behaved like HW animals, indicating that glb-5 transgene can mimic the presence of the HW locus on V (Figures 2A and S1). Injection of a similar transgene bearing the N2 allele of glb-5 did not affect XQTL:HW turning behavior (Figures 2A and S1). These results indicate that the 765 bp duplication/insertion in glb-5 is the likely cause of the QTL on chromosome V. The expression of glb-5 was characterized with a bicistronic transgene that encoded the active HW allele of glb-5 followed by the coding region of GFP. In first larval stage (L1) animals, GFP was expressed prominently in the URX and BAG sensory neurons, with weaker and inconsistent expression in the ASG and ADF sensory neurons, the pharynx, and a few intestinal cells (Figure 2C). In older animals, GFP fluorescence was also observed in AQR and PQR sensory neurons. URX, AQR, and PQR are O2-sensing neurons that are required for npr-1 mutants to avoid high O2 on food (Chang et al., 2006Chang A.J. Chronis N. Karow D.S. Marletta M.A. Bargmann C.I.

Oxygen sensation and social feeding mediated by a C. elegans guanylate cyclase homologue.Nature. 2004; 430: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible functional link between glb-5 and the O2 response. Indeed, expressing the HW allele of glb-5 in XQTL:HW animals under the gcy-36 promoter, which is selectively expressed in the URX, AQR, and PQR neurons, was sufficient for HW-like behavior (Figures 2D and S1). The role of URX, AQR, and PQR in turning responses was confirmed using a strain in which the URX, AQR, and PQR neurons are selectively killed by the BH3 protein egl-1 (the transgene qaIs2241) (Chang et al., 2006Chang A.J. Chronis N. Karow D.S. Marletta M.A. Bargmann C.I. A distributed chemosensory circuit for oxygen preference in C. elegans.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e274Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). AQR, PQR, and URX were essential for the O2 and O2/CO2 responses in the VQTL::HW; XQTL::HW background, but they were not required for turning responses in N2 (Figures 2E and S1). An interesting result was observed in the VQTL:HW animals with glb-5HW and npr-1N2. Killing URX, AQR, and PQR in this strain resulted in an N2-like turning response, although the parent strain only responded to CO2 alone (Figures 2E and S1). Thus, the cell ablations uncovered a neuronal function that depends on the specific genetic background: URX, AQR, and PQR neurons with the glb-5HW allele inhibited N2-like O2/CO2 responses in VQTL:HW animals, but enhanced HW-like O2 and O2/CO2 responses in animals with HW alleles of both glb-5 and npr-1. Animals from the HW strain aggregate into feeding groups and accumulate strongly at the border of a bacterial lawn; these behaviors require the URX, AQR, and PQR neurons, low npr-1 activity, and high O2 levels (Coates and de Bono, 2002Coates J.C. de Bono M.

Oxygen sensation and social feeding mediated by a C. elegans guanylate cyclase homologue.Nature. 2004; 430: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). To ask whether glb-5 contributes to these more complex O2-dependent behaviors, aggregation and bordering were quantified in N2, HW, and introgressed strains. Indeed, aggregation in an npr-1HW genetic background was significantly modulated by the glb-5 allele: strains with glb-5N2 aggregated more strongly than strains with glb-5HW (Figure 3A). glb-5HW also suppressed the aggregation of an npr-1(ad609) loss-of-function allele, but in the npr-1N2 genetic background, there was virtually no aggregation regardless of glb-5 genotype (Figure 3A). As expected from the dominant nature of the glb-5HW allele, aggregation of the glb-5N2 strain was suppressed by expressing glb-5HW under its own promoter or under another promoter expressed in URX, AQR, and PQR neurons (Figure 3A). The glb-5 allele had relatively little effect on bordering behavior, which was largely determined by npr-1 genotype (Figure 3A). In principle, glb-5 could affect O2 sensation in URX, AQR, and PQR, or synaptic release onto other neurons, among other possibilities. A functional, GFP-tagged GLB-5 protein encoded by the HW allele of glb-5 was highly enriched in sensory endings of URX, AQR, and PQR, with less expression in cell bodies, axons, and dendrites (Figure 3B). This localization suggests a role for GLB-5 in sensory transduction. Previous studies with genetically encoded calcium sensors have shown that the URX neurons are activated by O2 upshifts from 10%→21% or 15%→21% O2 (Zimmer et al., 2009Zimmer M. Gray J.M. Pokala N. Chang A.J. Karow D.S. Marletta M.A. Hudson M.L. Morton D.B. Chronis N. Bargmann C.I. Neurons detect increases and decreases in oxygen levels using distinct guanylate cyclases.Neuron. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar). The glb-5-dependent behaviors in HW suggest that glb-5 might affect URX responses to smaller O2 changes. Therefore, calcium responses of URX were monitored in response to upshifts from 20%→21% O2, the conditions in which N2 and HW behaved differently. In the VQTL:HW animals with the glb-5HW allele, these small O2 20%→21% upshifts induced rapid calcium transients in URX (Figures 3C and 3D) but in the N2 strain, similar upshifts had no apparent effect. Similar URX responses to 20%→21% O2 were observed in glb-5HW strains with either npr-1HW and npr-1N2 alleles, but not in any glb-5N2 strains (Figures 3C and 3D). These results suggest that the HW allele of glb-5 sensitizes URX responses to small 20%→21% O2 upshifts. To assess the frequency and distribution of glb-5 and npr-1 alleles in the wild, each gene was characterized in 203 C. elegans isolates from Europe, North America, Africa, South America, Australia, and Japan (Table S3). The genotypes were highly skewed: 190 strains had HW alleles of both genes, and 12 strains had N2 alleles of both npr-1 and glb-5, of which only one was isolated in the past 15 years (Figure 4A). One strain (TR389) had the N2 allele of npr-1 and the HW allele of glb-5. Additional genotyping at 1454 loci revealed that all N2-like strains were genetically similar (Figure 4B). Nine of the N2-like strains were identical in at least 1453 out of 1454 HW/N2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (group 1, Figure 4B). The"

https://openalex.org/W2037533459,"Once all chromosomes are connected to the mitotic spindle (bioriented), anaphase is initiated by the protein ubiquitylation activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and its coactivator Cdc20 (APC/C(Cdc20)). Before chromosome biorientation, anaphase is delayed by a mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) that inhibits APC/C(Cdc20). We used single-particle electron microscopy to obtain three-dimensional models of human APC/C in various functional states: bound to MCC, to Cdc20, or to neither (apo-APC/C). These experiments revealed that MCC associates with the Cdc20 binding site on APC/C, locks the otherwise flexible APC/C in a ""closed"" state, and prevents binding and ubiquitylation of a wide range of different APC/C substrates. These observations clarify the structural basis for the inhibition of APC/C by spindle checkpoint proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2136470556,"Early during neuromuscular development, acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) accumulate at the center of muscle fibers, precisely where motor growth cones navigate and synapses eventually form. Here, we show that Wnt11r binds to the zebrafish unplugged/MuSK ectodomain to organize this central muscle zone. In the absence of such a zone, prepatterned AChRs fail to aggregate and, as visualized by live-cell imaging, growth cones stray from their central path. Using inducible unplugged/MuSK transgenes, we show that organization of the central muscle zone is dispensable for the formation of neural synapses, but essential for AChR prepattern and motor growth cone guidance. Finally, we show that blocking noncanonical dishevelled signaling in muscle fibers disrupts AChR prepatterning and growth cone guidance. We propose that Wnt ligands activate unplugged/MuSK signaling in muscle fibers to restrict growth cone guidance and AChR prepatterns to the muscle center through a mechanism reminiscent of the planar cell polarity pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2023443384,"Background The adult endocrine pituitary is known to host several hormone-producing cells regulating major physiological processes during life. Some candidates to progenitor/stem cells have been proposed. However, not much is known about pituitary cell renewal throughout life and its homeostatic regulation during specific physiological changes, such as puberty or pregnancy, or in pathological conditions such as tumor development. Principal Findings We have identified in rodents and humans a niche of non-endocrine cells characterized by the expression of GFRa2, a Ret co-receptor for Neurturin. These cells also express b-Catenin and E-cadherin in an oriented manner suggesting a planar polarity organization for the niche. In addition, cells in the niche uniquely express the pituitary-specific transcription factor Prop1, as well as known progenitor/stem markers such as Sox2, Sox9 and Oct4. Half of these GPS (GFRa2/Prop1/Stem) cells express S-100 whereas surrounding elongated cells in contact with GPS cells express Vimentin. GFRa2+-cells form non-endocrine spheroids in culture. These spheroids can be differentiated to hormone-producing cells or neurons outlining the neuroectoderm potential of these progenitors. In vivo, GPSs cells display slow proliferation after birth, retain BrdU label and show long telomeres in its nuclei, indicating progenitor/stem cell properties in vivo. Significance Our results suggest the presence in the adult pituitary of a specific niche of cells characterized by the expression of GFRa2, the pituitary-specific protein Prop1 and stem cell markers. These GPS cells are able to produce different hormone-producing and neuron-like cells and they may therefore contribute to postnatal pituitary homeostasis. Indeed, the relative abundance of GPS numbers is altered in Cdk4-deficient mice, a model of hypopituitarism induced by the lack of this cyclin-dependent kinase. Thus, GPS cells may display functional relevance in the physiological expansion of the pituitary gland throughout life as well as protection from pituitary disease."
https://openalex.org/W1990717499,"Reverse genetics approaches rely on the detection of sequence alterations in target genes to identify allelic variants among mutant or natural populations. Current (pre-) screening methods such as TILLING and EcoTILLING are based on the detection of single base mismatches in heteroduplexes using endonucleases such as CEL 1. However, there are drawbacks in the use of endonucleases due to their relatively poor cleavage efficiency and exonuclease activity. Moreover, pre-screening methods do not reveal information about the nature of sequence changes and their possible impact on gene function. We present KeyPoint technology, a high-throughput mutation/polymorphism discovery technique based on massive parallel sequencing of target genes amplified from mutant or natural populations. KeyPoint combines multi-dimensional pooling of large numbers of individual DNA samples and the use of sample identification tags (""sample barcoding"") with next-generation sequencing technology.

https://openalex.org/W2143482057,"Axial muscles are innervated by motor neurons of the median motor column (MMC). In contrast to the segmentally restricted motor columns that innervate limb, body wall, and neuronal targets, MMC neurons are generated along the entire length of the spinal cord. We show that the specification of MMC fate involves a dorsoventral signaling program mediated by three Wnt proteins (Wnt4, Wnt5a, and Wnt5b) expressed in and around the floor plate. These Wnts appear to establish a ventralhigh to dorsallow signaling gradient and promote MMC identity and connectivity by maintaining expression of the LIM homeodomain proteins Lhx3/4 in spinal motor neurons. Elevation of Wnt4/5 activity generates additional MMC neurons at the expense of other motor neuron columnar subtypes, whereas depletion of Wnt4/5 activity inhibits the production of MMC neurons. Thus, two dorsoventral signaling pathways, mediated by Shh and Wnt4/5, are required to establish an early binary divergence in motor neuron columnar identity."
https://openalex.org/W2098864351,"Ultimately, whether or not a neuron produces a spike determines its contribution to local computations. In response to brief stimuli the probability a neuron will fire can be described by its input-output function, which depends on the net balance and timing of excitatory and inhibitory currents. While excitatory and inhibitory synapses are plastic, most studies examine plasticity of subthreshold events. Thus, the effects of concerted regulation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength on neuronal input-output functions are not well understood. Here, theoretical analyses reveal that excitatory synaptic strength controls the threshold of the neuronal input-output function, while inhibitory plasticity alters the threshold and gain. Experimentally, changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition in CA1 pyramidal neurons also altered their input-output function as predicted by the model. These results support the existence of two functional modes of plasticity that can be used to optimize information processing: threshold and gain plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1981848079,"Continuous bone remodeling in response to mechanical loading is critical for skeletal integrity, and interstitial fluid flow is an important stimulus for osteoblast/osteocyte growth and differentiation. However, the biochemical signals mediating osteoblast anabolic responses to mechanical stimulation are incompletely understood. In primary human osteoblasts and murine MC3T3-E1 cells, we found that fluid shear stress induced rapid expression of c-fos, fra-1, fra-2, and fosB/ΔfosB mRNAs; these genes encode transcriptional regulators that maintain skeletal integrity. Fluid shear stress increased osteoblast nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, leading to activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Pharmacological inhibition of the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway blocked shear-induced expression of all four fos family genes. Induction of these genes required signaling through MEK/Erk, and Erk activation was NO/cGMP/PKG-dependent. Treating cells with a membrane-permeable cGMP analog partly mimicked the effects of fluid shear stress on Erk activity and fos family gene expression. In cells transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) specific for membrane-bound PKG II, shear- and cGMP-induced Erk activation and fos family gene expression was nearly abolished and could be restored by transducing cells with a virus encoding an siRNA-resistant form of PKG II; in contrast, siRNA-mediated repression of the more abundant cytosolic PKG I isoform was without effect. Thus, we report a novel function for PKG II in osteoblast mechanotransduction, and we propose a model whereby NO/cGMP/PKG II-mediated Erk activation and induction of c-fos, fra-1, fra-2, and fosB/ΔfosB play a key role in the osteoblast anabolic response to mechanical stimulation.

One of the major intracellular targets of NO is soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which is activated on NO binding to the heme prosthetic group of the enzyme. The resultant increase in cGMP affects multiple target proteins, including cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs), phosphodiesterases, and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (36Munzel T. Feil R.

In this study, we found that fluid shear -stress induces c-fos, fra-1, fra-2, and fosB/ΔfosB mRNA expression in osteoblasts via NO/cGMP, and we define a new function for PKG II as a regulator of gene expression and activator of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk)-1/2 in mechanically stimulated osteoblasts.

Cell Culture and Characterization of Human Primary Osteoblasts—Murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells with high differentiation potential (clone 4, hereafter referred to as MC3T3 cells) and UMR106 rat osteosarcoma cells were from the American Tissue Culture Collection. MC3T3 cells were grown in minimal essential medium without ascorbic acid and UMR106 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; both cell lines were maintained in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and used at <12 passages. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as described previously (48Kuchan M.J. Jo H. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C753-C758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human primary osteoblasts (hPOBs) were established from trabecular bone obtained from surgical specimens of patients undergoing joint replacement for degenerative joint disease, according to an institutionally approved human subjects protocol as described previously (41Broderick K.E.

Exposure of Cells to Fluid Shear Stress—Cells were plated on 38 × 75-mm NaOH-etched glass slides at 0.5–1 × 106 cells/slide in minimal essential medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. After 18 h, they were serum-deprived for 24 h, and the slides were transferred to a parallel plate flow chamber (Cytodyne Inc., San Diego). Minimal essential medium with 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was injected into the chamber using a syringe pump at a flow rate that generated 12 dynes/cm2 of shear for up to 20 min (50Stevens H.Y. Frangos J.A. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 80: 381-398PubMed Google Scholar). The flow chamber, media, and accompanying apparatus were maintained at 37 °C throughout the experiment. Sham-treated cells served as “static controls”; they were grown under identical conditions and mounted into the flow chamber but were not subjected to shear stress. After shear stress, cells were left in the chamber without flow for the indicated time before harvesting. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RNA was extracted using TriReagent™ (Molecular Research Center, Inc.); 1 μg of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript™ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and PCR was performed on 5 or 10% of the RT product as described (51Casteel D.E.

The PCR primers for amplification of murine and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapd), c-fos, fra-1, fra-2, fosB/ΔfosB, pkg I, and pkg II mRNA are described in supplemental Table 1. Semi-quantitative PCR conditions for c-fos and gapd were 30 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 30 s annealing at 65 °C, and 30 s extension at 72 °C for 23 cycles; for fra-1/2 and fosB annealing and extension were 45 s at 60 °C for 25 cycles. Control experiments with variable amounts of input cDNA demonstrated a linear increase in a single PCR product over a >20-fold range. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using an MX3000 real time PCR detection system (Stratagene) and IQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Melting curves after 40 cycles confirmed a single PCR product for each primer pair. Standard curves were generated by plotting Ct values versus the amount of input RNA, and demonstrated similar amplification efficiencies for all primers. Relative changes in mRNA expression were analyzed using the 2–ΔΔCt method, with gapd serving as an internal reference to correct for differences in RNA extraction or reverse transcription efficiencies (52Zeng Y.

Quantitation of NOx and cGMP—Nitric oxide production was monitored based on nitrite and nitrate accumulation in the medium using a two-step colorimetric assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Active Motif), but the assay was scaled down 10-fold, and samples were read using a NanoDrop™ spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.). Experiments were performed in phenol red-free medium, with 5 × 105 cells/slide in the parallel plate flow chamber described above. cGMP production was measured in cell lysates using a competitive enzyme immunoassay from Cayman according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA and siRNA Transfections—MC3T3 cells (1.5 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of expression vector encoding human VASP in 100 μl of solution V using the Amaxa Nucleoporator program D-24. After overnight recovery in full growth medium, cell from several transfections were pooled, and equal numbers of cells were plated on glass slides for shear experiments. The sequence targeted by siRNA in the C terminus of PKG Iα/β was 5′-CCGGACAUUUAAAGACAGCAA-3′ (siRNA PKG-1). The sequences targeted in PKG II were 5′-CTGCTTGGAAGTGGAATACTA-3′ (siRNA PKG-2a) and 5′-CCGGGTTTCTTGGGTAGTCAA-3′ (siRNA PKG-2b). siRNA oligoribonucleotides, including a control siRNA targeting green fluorescent protein (GFP), were produced by Qiagen. MC3T3 cells were plated at 1.3 × 105 cells per well of a 6-well dish or at 5 × 105 cells per glass slide and were transfected 18 h later (at ∼40% confluency) with 100 pmol of siRNA and 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) in 1 ml of 10% FBS-containing media. The medium was replaced 5 h later, and 18 h later, cells were transferred to medium containing 0.1% FBS. Adenovirus Infection—Adenoviral vectors encoding either β-galactosidase (LacZ) or rat PKG II (53Jarchau T. Haeusler C. Markert T. Poehler D. Vandekerckhove J. De Jonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9426-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) were produced using the pAd/CMV/V5-DEST™ Gateway® system (Invitrogen). Cells were infected in full growth medium at an multiplicity of infection of ∼30. Western Blot Analyses, Cell Fractionation, and PKG Activity Assay—Western blots were generated using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence as described (45Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine PKG II activity, MC3T3 cells were extracted by Dounce homogenization, and nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min to generate “cytosolic” (supernatant) and “membrane” (pellet) fractions. PKG II activity in the membrane fraction was determined in the presence of 1% Triton-X-100 and 500 mm NaCl, as described previously (40Chen Y. Zhuang S. Cassenaer S. Casteel D.E. Gudi T. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4066-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, membranes were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm β-octyl glucoside. Films were scanned using ImageJ software (nih.gov). Statistical Analyses—Pairwise comparison of data groups was done by two-tailed Student's t test and comparison of multiple groups by analysis of variance, with a Dunnett's post test analysis to the control group; a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results shown in bar graphs represent the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments, unless stated otherwise. All other results are representative experiments that were reproduced at least three times. Fluid Shear Stress Induces c-fos, fra-1, fra-2, and fosB/ΔfosB mRNA Expression in Osteoblasts—Osteoblast c-fos and fosB/ ΔfosB mRNA and protein are induced rapidly by mechanical loading in rat vertebrae and mouse limb bones in vivo and by fluid shear stress in osteoblast cell lines or primary rodent osteoblasts (13Moalli M.R.

Genetic experiments have implicated fra-1 and fra-2 in regulating osteoblast differentiation and bone mass (6Wagner E.F. Eferl R. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 208: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). We found that c-fos, fra-1, fra-2, and fosB/ΔfosB mRNAs were strongly induced 30 min after the onset of flow in both MC3T3 cells and hPOBs and remained elevated for at least 2 h (Fig. 1A shows hPOBs, results for MC3T3 cells are shown in supplemental Fig. 1A). The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapd) was not affected by fluid shear in either cell type. Real time RT-PCR analysis in MC3T3 cells showed that c-fos mRNA increased 30–40-fold at all time points, and that fra-1 and fra-2 mRNA levels increased progressively up to 50- and 10-fold, respectively, at 2 h compared with sham-treated control cells (Fig. 1B). Basal mRNA levels of all four fos genes were somewhat variable in sham-treated cells, explaining the relatively large standard deviations in Fig. 1B; this may be due to the sensitivity of the cells to even small changes in fluid flow that can occur during mounting of the slides. Similar results were obtained in UMR106 rat osteosarcoma cells (data not shown). Fluid Shear Stress Induces NO and cGMP Production, eNOS, and VASP Phosphorylation—Mechanical stimulation of osteoblasts or osteocytes induces NO synthesis and increased shear rates correlate with increased NO production (55Bacabac R.G.

Alternative exon usage is regulated by the transient formation of protein complexes on the pre-mRNA that typically contain heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Here we characterize hnRNP G, a member of the hnRNP class of proteins. We show that hnRNP G is a nuclear protein that is expressed in different concentrations in various tissues and that interacts with other splicing regulatory proteins. hnRNP G is part of the supraspliceosome, where it regulates alternative splice site selection in a concentration-dependent manner. Its action on alternative exons can occur without a functional RNA-recognition motif by binding to other splicing regulatory proteins. The RNA-recognition motif of hnRNP G binds to a loose consensus sequence containing a CC(A/C) motif, and hnRNP G preferentially regulates alternative exons where this motif is clustered in close proximity. The X-chromosomally encoded hnRNP G regulates different RNAs than its Y-chromosomal paralogue RNA-binding motif protein, Y-linked (RBMY), suggesting that differences in alternative splicing, evoked by the sex-specific expression of hnRNP G and RBMY, could contribute to molecular sex differences in mammals.

All protein-coding genes undergo pre-mRNA processing, and the large majority of these genes are alternatively spliced (1Moore M.J. Science. 2005; 309: 1514-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Alternative exons can change many functional aspects of mRNAs and their encoded proteins. The best understood functions are stop codons or frameshifts that are introduced by 20–35% of alternative exons, which often destine the altered mRNA to nonsense-mediated decay. Examples described in the literature show that alternative splicing regulates the binding properties, intracellular localization, enzymatic activity, protein stability, and post-translational modifications of a large number of proteins (reviewed in Ref. 2Stamm S. Ben-Ari S. Rafalska I. Tang Y. Zhang Z. Toiber D. Thanaraj T.A. Soreq H. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 344: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that alternative pre-mRNA processing is a key mechanism regulating the gene expression of complex organisms by generating multiple mRNA isoforms, which encode functionally diverse proteins. Despite its importance, the exact mechanisms governing splice site selection are still poorly understood. In vertebrate systems, protein complexes assemble transiently on exons, and their interaction with the splicing machinery as well as RNA-RNA interactions between spliceosomal proteins and pre-mRNA determine whether an exon is included or skipped (reviewed in Refs. 3Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar and 4Stamm S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1223-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). When isolated from nuclei of mammalian cells, RNA polymerase II transcripts are found assembled in large ribonucleoprotein 21-MDa complexes, the supraspliceosome, composed of all five spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins as well as additional proteins. The entire repertoire of nuclear pre-mRNAs, independent of their length or number of introns, is individually found assembled in supraspliceosomes (reviewed in Ref. 5Sperling J. Azubel M. Sperling R. Structure (Lond.). 2008; 16: 1605-1615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Structural studies revealed that the supraspliceosome is composed of four substructures considered to be native spliceosomes that are connected by the pre-mRNA (6Muller S. Wolpensinger B.

Supraspliceosomes are active in splicing (7Azubel M. Habib N. Sperling R. Sperling J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and contain regulatory splicing factors such as all phosphorylated SR proteins, which are essential for splicing and splicing regulation (12Yitzhaki S. Miriami E. Sperling R. Sperling J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8830-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Supraspliceosomes also harbor other components of pre-mRNA processing, such as the editing enzymes ADAR1 and ADAR2 (13Raitskin O. Cho D.S. Sperling J. Nishikura K. Sperling R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6571-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), cap-binding proteins, and components of the 3′-end processing activity (14Raitskin O. Angenitzki M. Sperling J. Sperling R. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 140: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results support the view that the supraspliceosome is a nuclear pre-mRNA processing machine. hnRNP 3The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; RRM, RNA-recognition motif; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; IP, immunoprecipitated; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitated; SMN2, survival of motoneuron 2. G was discovered some time ago as an autoantigen that is glycosylated, binds to RNA, and is present in lampbrush chromosomes (15Soulard M. Della Valle V. Siomi M.C. Pinol-Roma S. Codogno P. Bauvy C. Bellini M. Lacroix J.C. Monod G. Dreyfuss G. Larsen C.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4210-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The protein has an N-terminal RNA recognition motif, followed by a C-terminal domain rich in RG and SR repeats, as well as tyrosine residues. hnRNP G suppresses growth of squamous carcinoma cells, whereas mutated hnRNP G fails to stop cancerous cell growth, indicating that hnRNP G could be a tumor suppressor (16Shin K.H. Kang M.K. Kim R.H. Christensen R. Park N.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 3222-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In humans, hnRNP G is encoded by the RBMX gene, located on the X chromosome. Its paralogue on the Y chromosome is the testis-specific RBMY, which is necessary for normal sperm development in humans (17Elliott D.J. Int. J. Androl. 2004; 27: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, humans express a testis-specific gene, hnRNP G-T, which is autosomally encoded. RBMY and hnRNP G are highly similar and share 88% identity in their RNA binding domain. Both RBMY and hnRNP G were shown to interact with the SR-like protein Tra2-β and the STAR proteins SAM68, SLM-1, and SLM-2 (18Venables J.P. Elliott D.J. Makarova O.V. Makarov E.M. Cooke H.J. Eperon I.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 685-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hnRNP G has been shown to regulate alternative splicing in several model systems, including SMN2 and tau and α-tropomyosin, but its mechanism of action is not clear (19Hofmann Y. Wirth B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wang J. Gao Q.-S. Wang Y. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Andreadis A. J.

Genet. 2003; 12: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). RBMY binds RNA stem structures containing a C(A/U)CAA loop sequence. RBMY recognizes this loop in a sequence-specific manner and also binds to the stem in a structure-specific manner. This represents a new way of RNA binding by an RRM (22Skrisovska L. Bourgeois C.F. Stefl R. Grellscheid S.N. Kister L. Wenter P. Elliott D.J. Stevenin J. Allain F.H. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we show that hnRNP G is a component of the supraspliceosome that regulates alternative splice site selection. hnRNP G influences splice site selection in two ways. The first way is independent of RNA binding and depends on the C terminus of hnRNP G binding to splicing regulatory proteins. The second way depends on the RRM of hnRNP G that binds to sequences containing CC(A/C) motifs. In contrast to RBMY, these sequences do not contain stable stems. Although the hnRNP G and RBMY sequences are similar, both proteins recognize different sets of pre-mRNA, suggesting that the sex-specific expression of hnRNP G and RBMY contributes to mammalian molecular sex differences. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Molecular cloning was performed using standard protocols (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), and RT-PCR was performed as described (24Stoss O. Stoilov P. Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Stamm S. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1999; 4: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A matchmaker two-hybrid rat brain postnatal day 5 and an embryonic day 16 library (Stratagene) were screened using hTra2-β pGBT9 (25Beil B. Screaton G. Stamm S. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as bait. The yeast Gal4 two-hybrid screen was performed according to Fields and Song (26Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar) using the strain HF7c. For each screen, ∼6 × 106 transformants were screened with 100 μg of bait DNA and 50 μg of prey DNA. To test the interaction of hnRNP G with other proteins, 1 μg of hnRNP G fused to the Gal4 activation domain and 1 μg of interacting proteins fused to the Gal4 binding domain were cotransformed and plated onto triple dropout plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. Surviving colonies were restreaked on triple dropout plates supplemented with 10 mm 3-aminotriazole and isolated as described (27Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Schwaiger F.W. Obermeier A. Stamm S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3909-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot were performed as described (13Raitskin O. Cho D.S. Sperling J. Nishikura K.

Western blot was performed with anti-Tra2 (pan Tra2-β) (28Stoilov P. Daoud R. Nayler O. Stamm S. Hum. Mol.

In all experiments the protein in the “load control” represents about 10% of the input protein for the immunoprecipitation. Gel shift experiments were performed as described (29Stamm S. Casper D. Hanson V. Helfman D.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RNA was end-labeled, and 2 pmol of 32P-labeled RNA were incubated with protein for 15 min at 30 °C. The mobility was tested in 5% native polyacrylamide gels. In Vivo Splicing—Splicing assays and cotransfection were performed as described (24Stoss O. Stoilov P. Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Stamm S. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1999; 4: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), employing the SMN2 minigene (30Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). The tau MG contains the alternative exon 10, flanked by exons 9 and 11 (32Hartmann A.M. Rujescu D. Giannakouros T. Nikolakaki E. Goedert M. Mandelkow E.M. Gao Q.S. Andreadis A. Stamm S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Transfection of the minigenes was done in HEK293 cells. 1 μg of indicated minigenes was used together with increasing amounts of the indicated pEGFP constructs and with the appropriate amount of empty pEGFP-C2 vector to ensure that equal amounts of DNA were transfected. The calcium phosphate method was used for transfection. RNA was isolated 16–18 h post-transfection by using the total RNA kit (Qiagen, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed in a total volume of 8.5 μl by using 2 μl of RNA, 1 μl of oligo(dT) (0.5 mg/ml), 1 μl of first-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTP, 5 units of SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 60 min. To ensure that only plasmid-derived minigene transcript was detected, subsequent amplification was performed with a vector-specific forward primer (pCI-forward, 5′-GGTGTCCACTCCCAGTTCAA) and the SMN-specific reverse primer SMNex8-rev (SMNex8-reverse, 5′-GCCTCACCACCGTGCTGG) for SMN2 MG (31Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PCR products resolved on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels resulted in similar ratios. The ratio of exon inclusion to exon skipping was determined by using the ImageJ program. Supraspliceosome Isolation—Nuclear supernatants enriched for supraspliceosomes were prepared according to a procedure originally developed by Sperling et al. (33Sperling R. Sperling J. Levine A.D. Spann P. Stark G.R. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with minor changes (34Miriami E. Sperling J. Sperling R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3084-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear supernatants enriched for supraspliceosomal particles were prepared from purified nuclei of HeLa cells (CILBIOTECH, Mons, Belgium) or from HEK293 cells by microsonication of the nuclei and precipitation of the chromatin in the presence of tRNA. The nuclear supernatants were fractionated in 10–45% glycerol gradients. Supraspliceosomes sediment at the 200 S region of the glycerol gradient (using tobacco mosaic virus as a sedimentation coefficient marker). Supraspliceosome Fractionation on Native Gels—For fractionation of supraspliceosomes in native composite gels (1.5% polyacrylamide, 0.6% agarose), we used a protocol adapted from Ref. 35Nadano D. Aoki C. Yoshinaka T. Irie S. Sato T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15184-15193Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar with modifications. Supraspliceosomes prepared from cells overexpressing EGFP-hnRNP G were concentrated at 4 °C, using ultrafiltration columns (Vivaspin 15R, Sartorius), and electrophoresed at 10 V/cm for 4 h at 4 °C in 40 mm Tris base, 25 mm acetic acid, and 2 mm MgCl2. Samples were extracted from the EGFP fluorescent band and visualized by EM using negative staining (1% uranyl acetate). The gel was also Western-blotted with antibodies against hnRNP G. In Vitro SELEX—An initial PCR to amplify the DNA pool was performed using primers T7 pro (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATCCGAATTCCCGACT-3′) and RT (5′-GCGTCTCGAGAAGCTTCCC-3′). The PCR product was cut from an 8% polyacrylamide gel, crushed, and 600 μl of extraction solution (4 ml of ammonium acetate, 0.8 ml of EDTA 0.5 m, pH 8.3, 5.2 ml of H2O) added. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight on a rotating wheel. After spinning down at full speed for 5 min, the supernatant was taken to a fresh tube, mixed with 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol, and placed at -80 °C for 3 h. After centrifuging the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 10 μl of H2O. After performing in vitro transcription with 1 μg of the amplified DNA pool in a total of 250 μl for 3 h at 37 °C, DNase treatment and phenol/chloroform extraction were carried out, and the transcribed RNA was precipitated overnight at -80 °C. The mixture was centrifuged and washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 70 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 + 0.1 mg/ml tRNA). 25 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was washed in binding buffer without tRNA, and the RNA was preincubated with the resin for 15 min at 4 °C. The resin was removed, and 20 μl of purified His-hnRNP G was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 25 μl of resin, washed with binding buffer, was added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing the agarose resin twice with binding buffer, 50 ml of 2× proteinase K buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, + 25 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl + 2% SDS) and 5 μg of proteinase K were added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation containing glycogen. For performing reverse transcription reaction, the RNA was resuspended in 1× RT buffer (10 μl of first strand buffer, 4 μl of RT primer, 5 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, 31 μl of H2O), incubated for 10 min at 65 °C, spun down, and put on ice for 2 min. 0.5 μl of 0.1 m DTT, 1.0 μl of RNasin and 2.0 ml of Superscript II were added and incubated at 42 °C for 2 h. The reaction was heated for 15 min at 72 °C, and PCR was performed, using primers T7 pro and RT. The amplified DNA pool was purified from an 8% polyacrylamide gel as described above and another round of SELEX performed. After five rounds, the PCR products of the last SELEX round were cloned into TOPO vector and sequenced. Antiserum Generation—After coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, the peptide RDDGYSTKD was used to immunize rabbits. After 121 days, serum was purified by affinity chromatography, using the peptide. Dilution for Western blot was 1:1000 and for immunohistochemistry was 1:200. Northern Blot—A rat tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was first hybridized with a radioactively labeled hnRNP G cDNA probe lacking the first 320 nucleotides that encode RRM. Hybridization was according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probe was removed, and the membrane was reprobed with a radioactively labeled β-actin probe to verify loading in each lane. The membrane was then analyzed using a phosphorimager. Bioinformatics Analysis—To determine the single strandedness of a motif, we computed the probability that the motif is completely unpaired (PU value), as described previously (36Hiller M. Zhang Z. Backofen R. Stamm S. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: 2147-2155Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, we computed the PU value of the motif for 20 different context lengths (symmetric contexts ranging from 11 to 30 nucleotides up- and downstream of the given motif) using RNAfold from the Vienna RNA package (37Hofacker I.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3429-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). To obtain a single PU value for each motif, we averaged these 20 values. Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed using R. To analyze the distance between the CCM (M = A or C) motifs in exons, we first determined the average distance in the hnRNP G regulated and control exon set. As the control exons contain much less CCM motifs, it is expected that the distance between CCM in the controls is much larger. Consequently, we cannot directly compare the average distances between both groups. Therefore, we determined the expected distribution of the average values separately for both exon sets as follows. For each exon sequence, we generated 10,000 sequences of the same length containing the same number of CCM motifs at randomly chosen positions. This yields 10,000 random sets of exons. For each set, we determined the average distance of the randomly placed CCM motifs and derived the empirical expected distribution from these 10,000 values. This procedure was done separately for hnRNP G regulated and control exons. It should be noted that computing the median distance (instead of the average distance) leads to the same conclusion. Domain Structure, Expression, and Intranuclear Localization of hnRNP G—We identified rat hnRNP G in two-hybrid screens as an interacting partner of hTra2-β1, YT521-B, and scaffold attachment factor 1 (SAF-B1). Similar to human hnRNP G, the rat protein consists of an N-terminal RRM, followed by a proline-rich region, a region with RGG repeats, and an area rich in SR dipeptides (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1). The nucleic acid and protein sequences show 90 and 93% identity to human hnRNP G (supplemental Fig. 2). Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were made with this rat hnRNP G cDNA. To get the first insight into the biological function, we next determined the expression of hnRNP G by Northern blot analysis. We probed a rat multiple tissue Northern blot with radiolabeled hnRNP G cDNA and subsequently tested for loading by probing the same membrane with β-actin cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1B, we observed hnRNP G expression in all tested tissues. Because there is often a discrepancy between RNA and protein expression, we determined hnRNP G expression using a peptide antiserum raised against residues 207–215, encoded by a constitutive exon of hnRNP G. As shown in Fig. 1C, hnRNP G was expressed in all tested tissues, although the amount detected was lower in heart and muscle when compared with other tissues. The expression in muscle becomes evident at longer exposure times (supplemental Fig. 4). Although there are numerous splice variants annotated in the data bases, we observed a single major band using this peptide encoded from a constitutive exon, indicating that the other splicing products of hnRNP G are either minor forms or not translated into protein. There is less hnRNP G protein in muscle and heart tissue, which is in accordance with the mRNA expression detected by Northern blot analysis. The hnRNP G sequence shows no predicted cellular localization signal. We therefore determined the intracellular localization of endogenous hnRNP G and performed immunohistochemistry with our antiserum. As shown in Fig. 1D, left, the immunoreactivity is localized in the nuclei of cells. The signal for hnRNP G depends on the peptide used for immunization, as preimmune serum shows no specific signal (Fig. 1D, right). Furthermore, the antiserum detects only a single band in Western blots after long exposure times (supplemental Fig. 4). hnRNP G staining excludes the nucleoli and is dispersed throughout the nucleoplasma. The nucleoplasmic staining is not homogeneous, as the protein is concentrated in numerous small granules. We next determined whether overexpressed protein has a similar localization and analyzed the expression of EGFP-tagged protein. As shown in Fig. 1E, EGFP-tagged full-length hnRNP G shows a nuclear localization very similar to the endogenous protein. It excludes the nucleoli, and the staining is concentrated in numerous granules. Numerous costaining experiments showed that these granules do not coincide with other known nuclear structures, such as SC35 speckles, coiled bodies, promyelocytic leukemia bodies, or YT bodies (38Nayler O. Hartmann A.M. Stamm S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We next determined which protein parts are involved in the intracellular localization of hnRNP G and performed a deletion analysis using the EGFP-tagged mutants. Destruction of the RNA recognition motif by deleting its first half did not change this nuclear localization, indicating that the RRM and RNA binding are not required for nuclear localization. This was confirmed by determining the localization of the RRM of hnRNP G, which is localized in both the nucleus and cytosol (Fig. 1E). Together, these data show that hnRNP G shows ubiquitous expression in various rat tissues. The expression levels are variable among tissues. The protein is generated from the major splicing variant, and we could not detect expression from other predicted isoforms generated by alternative splicing. The protein is nuclear, and its cellular localization is not determined by its RRM. Proteins Interacting with hnRNP G—We next used hnRNP G in a yeast two-hybrid screen against a rat embryonic brain library as described previously (27Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Schwaiger F.W. Obermeier A. Stamm S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3909-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We identified the proteins hnRNP G, SAF-B, YT521-B, Tra2-β1, SAM68, its related proteins SLM-1 and SLM-2 and mCLK2 as interacting partners for hnRNP G, as the presence of their cDNA allowed yeast to grow under high stringency conditions achieved by adding 10 mm 3-aminotriazole to the selection plates (Fig. 2A). To determine the protein parts involved in the interaction, we tested deletion clones of hnRNP G for its binding to these interaction partners and found that the interactions do not require a functional RRM (Fig. 2A). The interactions detected in yeast were observed when hnRNP G and its interacting partners were fused either to the Gal4 activation or binding domain (data not shown). Because yeast two-hybrid interactions are prone to experimental artifacts, we verified the interactions of these proteins by immunoprecipitation. We expressed full-length EGFP-tagged hnRNP G in HEK293 cells and precipitated it with anti-GFP antiserum. The immunoprecipitates contained benzonase, to ensure that we detect protein-protein interactions and not nucleic acid-mediated interactions. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot by probing for the endogenous interacting proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, B–G, this analysis could verify the protein-protein interactions against Tra2-β1, rSLM-1, YT521-B, and SAF-B and with endogenous hnRNP G. In addition, we detected an interaction between hnRNP G and mClk2, when both proteins were expressed from tagged cDNAs. Together, these data show that hnRNP G interacts with proteins involved in RNA metabolism and pre-mRNA splicing. These interactions are dependent on protein-protein interaction and do not require the RRM of hnRNP G. hnRNP G Is a Component of the Supraspliceosome—The protein interaction data indicated that hnRNP G acts in pre-mRNA processing, as all interacting proteins have been implicated in this process (39Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether hnRNP G is part of the supraspliceosome, a macromolecular machine, active in splicing, in which the entire repertoire of nuclear pre-mRNAs is individually packaged (7Azubel M. Habib N. Sperling R. Sperling J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Miriami E. Angenitzki M. Sperling R. Sperling J. J. Mol.

As shown in Fig. 3A, when nuclear supernatants enriched for supraspliceosomes are fractionated in glycerol gradients, endogenous hnRNP G is localized in the 21-MDa supraspliceosome fractions that peak around 200 S. Its distribution in the supraspliceosomal fractions is similar to that of the phosphorylated SR proteins (Fig. 3B), which have been previously shown to be associated with supraspliceosomes in these fractions (8Azubel M.

Such occurrences often lead to the silencing of these key genes and thus they may contribute to the development of cancer, including prostate cancer.In order to identify methylation changes in prostate cancer, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation using Agilent human CpG island arrays. Using computational and gene-specific validation approaches we have identified a large number of potential epigenetic biomarkers of prostate cancer. Further validation of candidate genes on a separate cohort of low and high grade prostate cancers by quantitative MethyLight analysis has allowed us to confirm DNA hypermethylation of HOXD3 and BMP7, two genes that may play a role in the development of high grade tumours. We also show that promoter hypermethylation is responsible for downregulated expression of these genes in the DU-145 PCa cell line.This study identifies novel epigenetic biomarkers of prostate cancer and prostate cancer progression, and provides a global assessment of DNA methylation in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2090936301,"Ikaros encodes a zinc finger protein that is involved in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling. The majority of Ikaros localizes at pericentromeric heterochromatin (PC-HC) where it regulates expression of target genes. Ikaros function is controlled by posttranslational modification. Phosphorylation of Ikaros by CK2 kinase determines its ability to bind DNA and exert cell cycle control as well as its subcellular localization. We report that Ikaros interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) via a conserved PP1 binding motif, RVXF, in the C-terminal end of the Ikaros protein. Point mutations of the RVXF motif abolish Ikaros-PP1 interaction and result in decreased DNA binding, an inability to localize to PC-HC, and rapid degradation of the Ikaros protein. The introduction of alanine mutations at CK2-phosphorylated residues increases the half-life of the PP1-nonbinding Ikaros mutant. This suggests that dephosphorylation of these sites by PP1 stabilizes the Ikaros protein and prevents its degradation. In the nucleus, Ikaros forms complexes with ubiquitin, providing evidence that Ikaros degradation involves the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. In vivo, Ikaros can target PP1 to the nucleus, and a fraction of PP1 colocalizes with Ikaros at PC-HC. These data suggest a novel function for the Ikaros protein; that is, the targeting of PP1 to PC-HC and other chromatin structures.

These studies established Ikaros as a key regulator of hematopoiesis and a major tumor suppressor whose loss of function is associated with the malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells. The mechanism by which Ikaros exerts its tumor suppressor activity is less clear. Ikaros exhibits a punctate staining pattern in normal and leukemia cells (14Klug C.A. Morrison S.J. Masek M. Hahm K.

Co-staining for Ikaros and HP1 proteins showed that this punctate staining pattern is because of the localization of Ikaros to pericentromeric heterochromatin (PC-HC) 3The abbreviations used are: PC-HC, pericentromeric heterochromatin; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole; TBB, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. 3The abbreviations used are: PC-HC, pericentromeric heterochromatin; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole; TBB, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer.

Ikaros binds in vitro and in vivo to the murine and human gamma satellite repeats that are located within the PC-HC, and Ikaros DNA binding ability is essential for its localization to PC-HC (16Cobb B.S.

Ikaros binds to the regulatory elements of its target genes in a sequence-dependent manner. Ikaros binding leads to the activation or repression of target genes via chromatin remodeling (17Koipally J. Heller E.J. Seavitt J.R. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol.

Thus, optimal Ikaros DNA binding is essential both for its subcellular localization and for its regulation of target genes. Ikaros associates with histone deacetylase (HDAC)-containing complexes (NuRD and Sin3) (19Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), although HDAC-independent binding to the transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein has been reported as well (20Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Ikaros also associates with Brg-1, a catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex that acts as an activator of gene expression (21O'Neill D.W. Schoetz S.S. Lopez R.A. Castle M. Rabinowitz L. Shor E. Krawchuk D. Goll M.G. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Han S. Seong R.H. Park S.D. Agalioti T. Munshi N. Thanos D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bank A. Mol. Cell.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The current hypothesis is that Ikaros binds the upstream region of target genes and aids in their recruitment to PC-HC, resulting in repression or activation of the gene (15Brown K.E. Guest S.S. Smale S.T. Hahm K. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Cell. 1997; 91: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 23Liberg D. Smale S.T. Merkenschlager M. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, Ikaros can act both as an activator and a repressor, depending on whether it associates with the NuRD, the C-terminal binding protein, or the SWI/SNF complex. Ikaros activity is regulated at a posttranslational level by various mechanisms. The association of the full-length Ikaros protein with its dominant negative isoforms impairs its activity, whereas the formation of complexes with other active isoforms can modify its function (24Molnár A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 25Ronni T. Payne K.J. Ho S. Bradley M.N. Dorsam G. Dovat S. J. Biol.

Sumoylation at two amino acids has been reported to regulate Ikaros repressor function (26Gomez-del Arco P. Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2688-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cell cycle-specific phosphorylation of Ikaros at an evolutionarily conserved linker regulates its DNA binding ability and nuclear localization during mitosis (27Dovat S. Ronni T. Russell D. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ikaros by CK2 kinase at its C-terminal region regulates its ability to control G1/S cell cycle progression (28Gomez-del Arco P. Maki K. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2797-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our previous work identified additional N-terminal phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated either directly by CK2 kinase or by another kinase in the CK2 signal transduction pathway (29Gurel Z.

Reversible phosphorylation of these amino acids regulates the subcellular localization of Ikaros to PC-HC as well as its ability to bind the upstream regulatory element of the Ikaros target gene, TdT (29Gurel Z.

These data identified CK2 kinase as a major regulator of Ikaros function. Because the overexpression of CK2 kinase leads to T-cell leukemia, it has been hypothesized that the impairment of Ikaros function is one of the mechanisms by which CK2 kinase promotes malignant transformation. In this report we demonstrate that Ikaros is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and identify the specific amino acids that are responsible for Ikaros-PP1 interactions. We show that the process of Ikaros dephosphorylation by PP1 is essential for normal Ikaros function and to prevent accelerated Ikaros degradation via the ubiquitin pathway. We also propose a novel function for Ikaros; that is, to target PP1 to PC-HC in hematopoietic cells. Cells—The murine VL3-3M2 thymocyte leukemia cell line has been described previously (30Groves T.

Antibodies to detect the hemagglutinin tag (12CA5) were purchased from Covance (Princeton, NJ). In Vivo Labeling—For in vivo labeling, 293T cells were incubated with radioactive orthophosphate. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated for 4 h with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in phosphate-free medium.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Ikaros Proteins—cDNA for the murine full-length Ikaros isoform, IK-VI, was amplified and cloned into a pGEX-2T GST-containing vector (Amersham Biosciences) that was cleaved with BamH1 and EcoR1 as described previously (34Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G.S. Turck C. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). IK-VI-GST-containing pGEX-2T plasmid was transformed and expressed in the SCS-1 strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). E. coli were induced with 1 mm iospropylthiogalactopyranoside for 2 h in the presence of 100 μm ZnCl2. The GST-IK-VI fusion protein was purified from E. coli according to the standard procedures (Amersham Biosciences) except that all of the buffers contained 10 μm ZnCl2 as described previously (34Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G.S. Turck C. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Fractions that contained purified GST-IK-VI protein were pooled and stored at -80 °C. GST Pulldown Assay—The full-length Ikaros-GST fusion protein (10 μg) or GST protein, as a negative control, were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads and then mixed with cell lysate of VL3-3M2 cells (a total of 2 mg of protein in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin and leupeptin)) for 2 h. After incubations, samples were washed with lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of PP1 was detected by Western blot with anti-PP1 antibody. Plasmids and Transfection—Alanine substitution mutants for IK-VI were generated using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The full-length Ikaros isoform IK-VI and its alanine mutants were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). For transfection, 1 μg of each construct was used to transfect 293T cells via the calcium phosphate method. Confocal Microscopy—293T cells were transfected with appropriate constructs and analyzed by confocal microscopy as described previously (16Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2146-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Images were acquired at room temperature by a Leica TCS-SP MP Confocal and Multiphoton Microscope with a Leica DM-LFS body (upright fixed-stage microscope) using a 100× Leica HX PLAPO (Planapo) oil immersion lens with numerical aperture of 1.4 (Heidelberg, Germany). Biochemical Experiments—Nuclear extractions, Western blots, and gel-shift experiments were performed as described previously (16Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E. Fisher A.G.

Degradation Assay—Pulse-chase analysis was performed in 293T cells as described previously (36Li Y. Suresh Kumar K.G. Tang W. Spiegelman V.S. Fuchs S.Y. Mol.

The 293T cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected with full-length Ikaros constructs or the indicated mutants. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h, and then medium was replaced with cysteine- and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After starvation for 1 h, cells were labeled with a [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Chase was performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 2 mm unlabeled methionine and cysteine. Cells were harvested at indicated time points and lysed in RIPA buffer with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors. Ikaros proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Ikaros-CTS antibodies, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. In the degradation assay described in Fig. 4D, MOLT-4 cells were treated with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich catalogue #C1988) in the presence or absence of calyculin (10 nm) (Calbiochem catalogue #208851) and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB, 50 μm) (Calbiochem catalogue #287891) or 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole (TBB, 10 μm) (Sigma). Cells were harvested at the indicated times, nuclear extract was obtained, and proteins from 20 μg of nuclear extracts from indicated time points were separated by SDS-PAGE. The presence of Ikaros isoforms was detected by anti-Ikaros-CTS antibodies. In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—Recombinant PP1 and PP2A were purchased from New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA. Ikaros protein and its mutants were expressed in 293T cells. Cells were labeled in vivo with radioactive orthophosphate as described above and harvested in RIPA, and proteins were immunoprecipitated and washed three times in NTN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% NP-40), then once in phosphatase reaction buffer. Immunoprecipitated Ikaros proteins bound to protein A beads were incubated with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Brij 35, 5 mm caffeine, and 0.1 mm EGTA) in the presence or absence of PP1 or PP2A (∼150 pm) as indicated. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min and was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. In Vivo Binding Assay—293T cells transfected with Ikaros or its mutant were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer. The Ikaros-PP1 interaction was tested by immunoprecipitation with anti-PP1 antibodies (Santa Cruz, sc 7482) followed by Western blot with anti-Ikaros CTS antibodies. The interaction between endogenous Ikaros and PP1 was tested in untransfected VL3-3M2, MOLT-4, CEM, HAFTL, and BAL17 cells. Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PP1 antibodies, and the presence of Ikaros was detected by Western blot using anti-Ikaros-CTS antibodies. For experiments described in Fig. 1C, 293T cells expressing Ikaros were labeled in vivo with radioactive orthophosphates (PerkinElmer Life Science) for 4 h and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ikaros-CTS antibodies on protein A beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with NTN buffer and once in phosphatase reaction buffer (described above). After washing, immunoprecipitates were incubated with phosphatase reaction buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors as indicated: a phosphatase inhibitor mixture, PPi (Sigma-Aldrich) in lane 1;no phosphatase inhibitor (lane 2); or PP1-specific inhibitor (inhibitor 2, lane 3). The reactions shown in all lanes were supplemented with the CK2 kinase inhibitors DRB and heparin. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Analysis of Ikaros Ubiquitination—MOLT-4 or VL3-3M2 cells were treated with Cbz-LLL (MG132) proteasome inhibitor (50 μm) (Calbiochem, catalogue #474790) for 2 h or left untreated (as indicated). Cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffed saline and lysed in RIPA buffer along with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ikaros-CTS antibody or with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Assay Designs/Stressgen Bioreagents, SPA-200) on protein A beads. Immunoprecipitates were eluted in SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE. Ikaros-ubiquitin conjugates were detected by Western blot using anti-Ikaros-CTS or anti-ubiquitin antibodies as indicated. PP1 Binds and Dephosphorylates Ikaros in Vitro and in Vivo—We tested the ability of different phosphatases to dephosphorylate Ikaros in vitro. Wild-type Ikaros was expressed in 293T cells, labeled in vivo by radioactive orthophosphate, and immunoprecipitated using anti-Ikaros-CTS antibody. The phosphatases PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C were used for in vitro reactions with immunoprecipitated Ikaros. Changes in Ikaros phosphorylation were visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Results showed that after in vitro reaction with PP1, Ikaros lost its radioactive phosphate (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 versus 4), whereas PP2A (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2) and PP2B and PP2C (data not shown) failed to dephosphorylate Ikaros. These data demonstrate that PP1 can dephosphorylate Ikaros. The ability of Ikaros to associate with PP1 was tested using a GST pulldown assay. The nuclear extract from VL3-3M2 cells was mixed with glutathione-agarose beads that were preincubated with GST-Ikaros fusion protein (Fig. 1B, lane 2) or GST protein alone (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Proteins that were bound to the beads were eluted and tested for the presence of PP1 by Western blot (Fig. 1B). These results show that Ikaros interacts with PP1 in a GST pulldown assay. Next, we tested whether Ikaros could be co-immunoprecipitated with PP1. First we examined the ability of Ikaros to be dephosphorylated by a co-immunoprecipitated protein and the ability of a PP1-specific inhibitor to abrogate this dephosphorylation. Ikaros-transfected 293T cells were labeled in vivo with radioactive orthophosphate, and whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ikaros-CTS antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then incubated with phosphatase buffer. Incubations were performed in the presence of a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (PPi, Fig. 1C, lane 1), the absence of phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 1C, lane 2), or in the presence of a PP1-specific inhibitor (Inhibit-2, Fig. 1C, lane 3). After incubation, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Results showed that the radioactive, in vivo phosphorylated Ikaros undergoes dephosphorylation when incubated with phosphatase buffer in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 1C lane 2), suggesting that a phosphatase was co-immunoprecipitated with Ikaros. The co-immunoprecipitated phosphatase activity is inhibited by the addition of a nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor mixture (PPi) or inhibitor-2, a PP1-specific inhibitor (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). These results show that Ikaros co-immunoprecipitates a phosphatase whose activity is inhibited by inhibitor-2, a PP1-specific inhibitor. These results suggest that Ikaros interacts in vivo with PP1. To confirm this, we determined whether Ikaros could be co-immunoprecipitated with PP1-specific antibodies (Fig. 1D). Immunoprecipitation with anti-PP1 antibodies followed by Western blot with anti-IK antibodies showed that PP1 co-immunoprecipitated transfected Ikaros in 293T cells as well as endogenous Ikaros in VL3-3M2 cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 6, respectively). Immunoprecipitations of untransfected 293T cells with anti-PP1 antibodies (Fig. 1D, lane 1) of Ikaros-transfected 293T and VL3-3M2 cells with anti-hemagglutinin antibodies (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 4) and of VL3-3M2 cells with anti-PP2A antibodies (Fig. 1D, lane 5) were used as negative controls. The association of endogenous Ikaros with endogenous PP1 in vivo in other human and murine hematopoietic cell lines was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-PP1 antibodies. The co-immunoprecipitated Ikaros isoforms were detected by Western blot with anti-IK antibodies (Fig. 1D, lanes 7-11). These experiments demonstrate that Ikaros associates with PP1 in hematopoietic cells in vivo. PP1 Interacts with Ikaros via a Specific Recognition Motif—To identify the recognition site that is required for PP1-Ikaros interaction, we tested the ability of PP1 to dephosphorylate Ikaros deletion mutants (Fig. 2A). In vivo phosphorylated Ikaros deletion mutants were immunoprecipitated and then incubated with appropriate buffer in the absence (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) or presence (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) of PP1, and their phosphorylation status was visualized by radiography. Results showed that PP1 is able to dephosphorylate in vitro all Ikaros deletion mutants except the mutant that lacked the C-terminal part of the protein (N-458, Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10). These results suggest that residues that are essential for the dephosphorylation of Ikaros by PP1 are located at the C-terminal part of Ikaros (Fig. 2B). It has been demonstrated that PP1 interacts with its substrate via a specific recognition motif, (R/K)X0-1(V/I)X(F/W) (38Wakula P. Beullens M. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

A search for potential residues involved in PP1-Ikaros interaction at the C-terminal end of the Ikaros protein revealed the presence of an evolutionarily conserved PP1 recognition motif at amino acids 459-470. A sequence comparison of this motif in the Ikaros protein to the PP1 recognition site in proteins known to interact with PP1 is provided in Fig. 2C. The Ikaros PP1 recognition motif is located within one of the C-terminal zinc fingers involved in protein-protein interactions with other Ikaros family members (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2020106539,"Thimet oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15; EP24.15) is an intracellular enzyme that has been proposed to metabolize peptides within cells, thereby affecting antigen presentation and G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction. However, only a small number of intracellular substrates of EP24.15 have been reported previously. Here we have identified over 100 peptides in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells that are derived from intracellular proteins; many but not all of these peptides are substrates or products of EP24.15. First, cellular peptides were extracted from HEK293 cells and incubated in vitro with purified EP24.15. Then the peptides were labeled with isotopic tags and analyzed by mass spectrometry to obtain quantitative data on the extent of cleavage. A related series of experiments tested the effect of overexpression of EP24.15 on the cellular levels of peptides in HEK293 cells. Finally, synthetic peptides that corresponded to 10 of the cellular peptides were incubated with purified EP24.15 in vitro, and the cleavage was monitored by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Many of the EP24.15 substrates identified by these approaches are 9-11 amino acids in length, supporting the proposal that EP24.15 can function in the degradation of peptides that could be used for antigen presentation. However, EP24.15 also converts some peptides into products that are 8-10 amino acids, thus contributing to the formation of peptides for antigen presentation. In addition, the intracellular peptides described here are potential candidates to regulate protein interactions within cells."
https://openalex.org/W2008460182,"The amount of genomic sequence information continues to grow at an exponential rate, while the identification and characterization of genes without known homologs remains a major challenge. For non-model organisms with limited resources for manipulative studies, high-throughput transcriptomic data combined with bioinformatics methods provide a powerful approach to obtain initial insights into the function of unknown genes. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a novel family of putatively secreted, small, cysteine-rich proteins herein named Small Cysteine-Rich Proteins (SCRiPs). Their discovery in expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries from the coral Montastraea faveolata required the performance of an iterative search strategy based on BLAST and Hidden-Markov-Model algorithms. While a discernible homolog could neither be identified in the genome of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, nor in a large EST dataset from the symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia pallida, we identified SCRiP sequences in multiple scleractinian coral species. Therefore, we postulate that this gene family is an example of lineage-specific gene expansion in reef-building corals. Previously published gene expression microarray data suggest that a sub-group of SCRiPs is highly responsive to thermal stress. Furthermore, data from microarray experiments investigating developmental gene expression in the coral Acropora millepora suggest that different SCRiPs may play distinct roles in the development of corals. The function of these proteins remains to be elucidated, but our results from in silico, transcriptomic, and phylogenetic analyses provide initial insights into the evolution of SCRiPs, a novel, taxonomically restricted gene family that may be responsible for a lineage-specific trait in scleractinian corals."
https://openalex.org/W2094492915,"Disease introduction into the New World during colonial expansion is well documented and had a major impact on indigenous populations; however, few diseases have been associated with early human migrations into North America. During the late Pleistocene epoch, Asia and North America were joined by the Beringian Steppe ecosystem which allowed animals and humans to freely cross what would become a water barrier in the Holocene. Anthrax has clearly been shown to be dispersed by human commerce and trade in animal products contaminated with Bacillus anthracis spores. Humans appear to have brought B. anthracis to this area from Asia and then moved it further south as an ice-free corridor opened in central Canada ∼13,000 ybp. In this study, we have defined the evolutionary history of Western North American (WNA) anthrax using 2,850 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 285 geographically diverse B. anthracis isolates. Phylogeography of the major WNA B. anthracis clone reveals ancestral populations in northern Canada with progressively derived populations to the south; the most recent ancestor of this clonal lineage is in Eurasia. Our phylogeographic patterns are consistent with B. anthracis arriving with humans via the Bering Land Bridge. This northern-origin hypothesis is highly consistent with our phylogeographic patterns and rates of SNP accumulation observed in current day B. anthracis isolates. Continent-wide dispersal of WNA B. anthracis likely required movement by later European colonizers, but the continent's first inhabitants may have seeded the initial North American populations."
https://openalex.org/W2036299385,"Many cellular processes require decision making mechanisms, which must act reliably even in the unavoidable presence of substantial amounts of noise. However, the multistable genetic switches that underlie most decision-making processes are dominated by fluctuations that can induce random jumps between alternative cellular states. Here we show, via theoretical modeling of a population of noise-driven bistable genetic switches, that reliable timing of decision-making processes can be accomplished for large enough population sizes, as long as cells are globally coupled by chemical means. In the light of these results, we conjecture that cell proliferation, in the presence of cell–cell communication, could provide a mechanism for reliable decision making in the presence of noise, by triggering cellular transitions only when the whole cell population reaches a certain size. In other words, the summation performed by the cell population would average out the noise and reduce its detrimental impact."
https://openalex.org/W1984166927,"RecQ DNA helicases are critical for preserving genome integrity. Of the five RecQ family members identified in humans, only the Werner syndrome protein (WRN) possesses exonuclease activity. Loss of WRN causes the progeroid disorder Werner syndrome which is marked by cancer predisposition. Cellular evidence indicates that WRN disrupts potentially deleterious intermediates in homologous recombination (HR) that arise in genomic and telomeric regions during DNA replication and repair. Precisely how the WRN biochemical activities process these structures is unknown, especially since the DNA unwinding activity is poorly processive. We generated biologically relevant mobile D-loops which mimic the initial DNA strand invasion step in HR to investigate whether WRN biochemical activities can disrupt this joint molecule. We show that WRN helicase alone can promote branch migration through an 84 base pair duplex region to completely displace the invading strand from the D-loop. However, substrate processing is altered in the presence of the WRN exonuclease activity which degrades the invading strand both prior to and after release from the D-loop. Furthermore, telomeric D-loops are more refractory to disruption by WRN, which has implications for tighter regulation of D-loop processing at telomeres. Finally, we show that WRN can recognize and initiate branch migration from both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the invading strand in the D-loops. These findings led us to propose a novel model for WRN D-loop disruption. Our biochemical results offer an explanation for the cellular studies that indicate both WRN activities function in processing HR intermediates."

The long phases of stable perception of reversible figures suggest a memory that persists for seconds. But persistence of similar duration has not been found in signals of the visual cortex. Here, we show that figure-ground signals in the visual cortex can persist for a second or more after the removal of the figure-ground cues. When new figure-ground information is presented, the signals adjust rapidly, but when a figure display is changed to an ambiguous edge display, the signals decay slowly--a behavior that is characteristic of memory devices. Figure-ground signals represent the layout of objects in a scene, and we propose that a short-term memory for object layout is important in providing continuity of perception in the rapid stream of images flooding our eyes."

https://openalex.org/W2026912481,"Primary human alveolar type II (AT II) epithelial cells maintained in Matrigel cultures form alveolar-like cysts (ALCs) using a cytogenesis mechanism that is different from that of other studied epithelial cell types: neither proliferation nor death is involved. During ALC formation, AT II cells engage simultaneously in fundamentally different, but not fully characterized activities. Mechanisms enabling these activities and the roles they play during different process stages are virtually unknown. Identifying, characterizing, and understanding the activities and mechanisms are essential to achieving deeper insight into this fundamental feature of morphogenesis. That deeper insight is needed to answer important questions. When and how does an AT cell choose to switch from one activity to another? Why does it choose one action rather than another? We report obtaining plausible answers using a rigorous, multi-attribute modeling and simulation approach that leveraged earlier efforts by using new, agent and object-oriented capabilities. We discovered a set of cell-level operating principles that enabled in silico cells to self-organize and generate systemic cystogenesis phenomena that are quantitatively indistinguishable from those observed in vitro. Success required that the cell components be quasi-autonomous. As simulation time advances, each in silico cell autonomously updates its environment information to reclassify its condition. It then uses the axiomatic operating principles to execute just one action for each possible condition. The quasi-autonomous actions of individual in silico cells were sufficient for developing stable cyst-like structures. The results strengthen in silico to in vitro mappings at three levels: mechanisms, behaviors, and operating principles, thereby achieving a degree of validation and enabling answering the questions posed. We suggest that the in silico operating principles presented may have a biological counterpart and that a semiquantitative mapping exists between in silico causal events and in vitro causal events."
https://openalex.org/W2049365451,"Glucocorticoid (GC) is known to affect the reproductive system by suppressing the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) gene expression in the hypothalamus. However, the mechanism of this effect is poorly understood. We show here that the GC-induced reduction of GnRH mRNA is due to attenuation of a post-transcriptional process i.e. splicing of intron A. Treatment of dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic GC, lowered GnRH mRNA transcripts and was accompanied by reduced excision of the first intron (intron A) from the GnRH pre-mRNA both in vitro and in vivo. While seeking to identify the splicing factors involved in GC-inhibited GnRH pre-mRNA splicing, we found that DEX down-regulated neuro-oncological ventral antigen-1 (Nova-1) mRNA and protein and that knockdown of Nova-1 reduced intron A excision from GnRH pre-mRNA. Nova-1 overexpression reversed the DEX-induced reduction of intron A excision. Nova-1 appears to promote intron A excision by binding to the distal region of exon 1 of the GnRH pre-mRNA. Taken together, our findings indicate that the intron A excision by Nova-1 is a target of GC for down-regulation of GnRH gene expression, and more importantly, we characterized Nova-1, a brain-enriched splicing regulator responsible for GnRH pre-mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2057690334,"An appealing tool for study of the complex biological behaviors that can emerge from networks of simple molecular interactions is an agent-based, computational simulation that explicitly tracks small-scale local interactions – following thousands to millions of states through time. For many critical cell processes (e.g. cytokinetic furrow specification, nuclear centration, cytokinesis), the flexible nature of cytoskeletal filaments is likely to be critical. Any computer model that hopes to explain the complex emergent behaviors in these processes therefore needs to encode filament flexibility in a realistic manner. Here I present a numerically convenient and biophysically realistic method for modeling cytoskeletal filament flexibility in silico. Each cytoskeletal filament is represented by a series of rigid segments linked end-to-end in series with a variable attachment point for the translational elastic element. This connection scheme allows an empirically tuning, for a wide range of segment sizes, viscosities, and time-steps, that endows any filament species with the experimentally observed (or theoretically expected) static force deflection, relaxation time-constant, and thermal writhing motions. I additionally employ a unique pair of elastic elements – one representing the axial and the other the bending rigidity– that formulate the restoring force in terms of single time-step constraint resolution. This method is highly local –adjacent rigid segments of a filament only interact with one another through constraint forces—and is thus well-suited to simulations in which arbitrary additional forces (e.g. those representing interactions of a filament with other bodies or cross-links / entanglements between filaments) may be present. Implementation in code is straightforward; Java source code is available at www.celldynamics.org."
https://openalex.org/W1982293214,"Many hypotheses are prevalent in the literature predicting why some plant species can become invasive. However, in some respects, we lack a standard approach to compare the breadth of various studies and differentiate between alternative explanations. Furthermore, most of these hypotheses rely on ‘changes in density’ of an introduced species to infer invasiveness. Here, we propose a simple method to screen invasive plant species for potential differences in density effects between novel regions. Studies of plant competition using density series are a fundamental tool applied to virtually every aspect of plant population ecology to better understand evolution. Hence, we use a simple density series with substitution contrasting the performance of Centaurea solstitialis in monoculture (from one region) to mixtures (seeds from two regions). All else being equal, if there is no difference between the introduced species in the two novel regions compared, Argentina and California, then there should be no competitive differences between intra and inter-regional competition series. Using a replicated regression design, seeds of each species were sown in the greenhouse at 5 densities in monoculture and mixed and grown till onset of flowering. Centaurea seeds from California had higher germination while seedlings had significantly greater survival than Argentina. There was no evidence for density dependence in any measure for the California region but negative density dependence was detected in the germination of seeds from Argentina. The relative differences in competition also differed between regions with no evidence of differential competitive effects of seeds from Argentina in mixture versus monoculture while seeds from California expressed a relative cost in germination and relative growth rate in mixtures with Argentina. In the former instance, lack of difference does not mean ‘no ecological differences’ but does suggest that local adaptation in competitive abilities has not occurred. Importantly, this method successfully detected differences in the response of an invasive species to changes in density between novel regions which suggests that it is a useful preliminary means to explore invasiveness."
