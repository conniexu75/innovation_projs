https://openalex.org/W3212489954,"The purpose of this study was to explore the adaptive mechanism underlying the photosynthetic characteristics and the ion absorption and distribution of white willow (Salix alba L.) in a salt stress environment in cutting seedlings. The results lay a foundation for further understanding the distribution of sodium chloride and its effect on the photosynthetic system.A salt stress environment was simulated in a hydroponics system with different NaCl concentrations in one-year-old Salix alba L.branches as the test materials. Their growth, ion absorption, transport and distribution in the roots and leaves, and the changes in the photosynthetic fluorescence parameters were studied after 20 days under hydroponics.The results show that The germination and elongation of roots are promoted in the presence of 171mM NaCl, but root growth is comprehensively inhibited under increasing salt stress. Under salt stress, Na+ accumulates significantly in the roots and leaves, and the Na+ content and the Na+/K+ and Na+/Ca2+ root ratios are significantly greater than those in the leaves. When the NaCl concentration is ≤ 342mM, Salix alba can maintain relatively stable K+ and Ca2+ contents in its leaves by improving the selective absorption and accumulation of K+ and Ca2+ and adjusting the transport capacity of mineral ions to aboveground parts, while K+ and Ca2+ levels are clearly decreased under high salt stress. With increasing salt concentrations, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (E) and stomatal conductance (gs) of leaves decrease gradually overall, and the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) first decreases and then increases. When the NaCl concentration is < 342mM, the decrease in leaf Pn is primarily restricted by the stomata. When the NaCl concentration is > 342mM, the decrease in the Pn is largely inhibited by non-stomatal factors. Due to the salt stress environment, the OJIP curve (Rapid chlorophyll fluorescence) of Salix alba turns into an OKJIP curve. When the NaCl concentration is > 171mM, the fluorescence values of points I and P decrease significantly, which is accompanied by a clear inflection point (K). The quantum yield and energy distribution ratio of the PSⅡ reaction center change significantly (φPo, Ψo and φEo show an overall downward trend while φDo is promoted). The performance index and driving force (PIABS, PICSm and DFCSm) decrease significantly when the NaCl concentration is > 171mM, indicating that salt stress causes a partial inactivation of the PSII reaction center, and the functions of the donor side and the recipient side are damaged.The above results indicate that Salix alba can respond to salt stress by intercepting Na+ in the roots, improving the selective absorption of K+ and Ca2+ and the transport capacity to the above ground parts of the plant, and increasing φDo, thus shows an ability to self-regulate and adapt."
https://openalex.org/W3160071558,"Here, we sought to quantify the effects of experienced fear and worry, engendered by the COVID-19 pandemic, on both cognitive abilities-speed of information processing, task-set shifting, and proactive control-as well as economic risk-taking. Leveraging a repeated-measures cross-sectional design, we examined the performance of 1517 participants, collected during the early phase of the pandemic in the US (April-June 2020), finding that self-reported pandemic-related worry predicted deficits in information processing speed and maintenance of goal-related contextual information. In a classic economic risk-taking task, we observed that worried individuals' choices were more sensitive to the described outcome probabilities of risky actions. Overall, these results elucidate the cognitive consequences of a large-scale, unpredictable, and uncontrollable stressor, which may in turn play an important role in individuals' understanding of, and adherence to safety directives both in the current crisis and future public health emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W3213721633,"The article expands our knowledge on the variety of biodegraders of ibuprofen, one of the most frequently detected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the environment. We studied the dynamics of ibuprofen decomposition and its relationship with the physiological status of bacteria and with additional carbon and energy sources. The involvement of cytoplasmic enzymes in ibuprofen biodegradation was confirmed. Within the tested actinobacteria, Rhodococcus cerastii IEGM 1278 was capable of complete oxidation of 100 μg/L and 100 mg/L of ibuprofen in 30 h and 144 h, respectively, in the presence of an alternative carbon source (n-hexadecane). Besides, the presence of ibuprofen induced a transition of rhodococci from single- to multicellular lifeforms, a shift to more negative zeta potential values, and a decrease in the membrane permeability. The initial steps of ibuprofen biotransformation by R. cerastii IEGM 1278 involved the formation of hydroxylated and decarboxylated derivatives with higher phytotoxicity than the parent compound (ibuprofen). The data obtained indicate potential threats of this pharmaceutical pollutant and its metabolites to biota and natural ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3213577625,"Develop and validate a prognostic model for clinical deterioration or death within days of pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis using point-of-care criteria.We used prospective registry data from six emergency departments. The primary composite outcome was death or deterioration (respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, new dysrhythmia, sustained hypotension, and rescue reperfusion intervention) within 5 days. Candidate predictors included laboratory and imaging right ventricle (RV) assessments. The prognostic model was developed from 935 PE patients. Univariable analysis of 138 candidate variables was followed by penalized and standard logistic regression on 26 retained variables, and then tested with a validation database (N = 801).Logistic regression yielded a nine-variable model, then simplified to a nine-point tool (PE-SCORE): one point each for abnormal RV by echocardiography, abnormal RV by computed tomography, systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg, dysrhythmia, suspected/confirmed systemic infection, syncope, medico-social admission reason, abnormal heart rate, and two points for creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL. In the development database, 22.4% had the primary outcome. Prognostic accuracy of logistic regression model versus PE-SCORE model: 0.83 (0.80, 0.86) vs. 0.78 (0.75, 0.82) using area under the curve (AUC) and 0.61 (0.57, 0.64) vs. 0.50 (0.39, 0.60) using precision-recall curve (AUCpr). In the validation database, 26.6% had the primary outcome. PE-SCORE had AUC 0.77 (0.73, 0.81) and AUCpr 0.63 (0.43, 0.81). As points increased, outcome proportions increased: a score of zero had 2% outcome, whereas scores of six and above had ≥ 69.6% outcomes. In the validation dataset, PE-SCORE zero had 8% outcome [no deaths], whereas all patients with PE-SCORE of six and above had the primary outcome.PE-SCORE model identifies PE patients at low- and high-risk for deterioration and may help guide decisions about early outpatient management versus need for hospital-based monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3214054147,"In this study, we determined the effects of dietary chitosan on the growth, biochemical composition, gut microbiota, and hematological and histological parameters of juvenile Barbonymus gonionotus . Three test diets containing three different concentrations (1, 2, and 3 g kg -1 feed) of dietary chitosan were formulated. A basal diet without dietary chitosan was considered a control, and the fish were reared for 60 days. Comparing the effects of the dietary chitosan-containing diets with those of the control diet, we found that dietary chitosan significantly improved the muscle growth, nutrient and mineral contents, hematological parameters, lactic acid bacterium abundance, and digestive enzyme activities of B . gonionotus . Moreover, dietary chitosan significantly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria in fish. Interestingly, an increase in the dietary chitosan level significantly enhanced the protein contents of the muscles and inversely significantly decreased the lipid contents compared to those with the basal diet. Quantitative study revealed that dietary chitosan significantly enhanced the length of intestinal villi, and qualitative study showed that dietary chitosan considerably reduced the fat content in the liver and improved the morphology of the kidney compared to those with the basal diet. Taken together, our results suggest that the application of dietary chitosan at a dose of 1 g kg -1 feed produced the highest benefit to treated B . gonionotus , indicating its potential for safe use in aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W3212370706,"Patients admitted on weekends have higher mortality than those admitted on weekdays. However, whether the ""weekend effect"" results in a higher mortality after admission for acute aortic dissection (AAD),-classified according to Stanford types-remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between admission day and in-hospital mortality in AAD Type A and B.We used data from the Japanese registry of all Cardiac and Vascular Diseases Diagnostic Procedure Combination, a nationwide claim-based database with data from 953 certified hospitals, and enrolled in-patients with AAD admitted between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2016. Based on the admission day, we stratified patients into groups (Weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays/holidays). The influence of the admission day on in-hospital mortality was assessed via multi-level logistic regression analysis. We also performed a Stanford type-based stratified analysis.Among the included 25,641 patients, in-hospital mortality was 16.0%. The prevalence of patients admitted with AAD was relatively higher on weekdays. After adjustment for covariates, patients admitted on a Sunday/holiday showed an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.33, p<0.001) than patients admitted on weekdays. Among patients admitted on a Sunday/holiday, only the subgroup of Stanford Type A showed a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality. (Stanford Type A, non-surgery vs. surgery groups: 95% CI 1.06-1.48 vs. 1.17-1.68, p<0.001 for both groups, OR 1.25 vs. 1.41, respectively, Stanford Type B, non-surgery vs. surgery groups: 95% CI 0.64-1.09 vs. 0.40-2.10; p = 0.182 vs. 0.846; OR 0.84 vs. 0.92).In conclusion, patients with AAD Type A admitted on a Sunday/holiday may have an increased in-hospital mortality risk."
https://openalex.org/W3214552050,"Heated tobacco products (HTPs) have become popular recently. People with chronic disease, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cancer, should quit smoking for treatment and recurrence of tobacco-related diseases. However, they have difficulty in quitting smoking, and they may start HTPs use to quit smoking. The purpose of this study is to examine the use of HTPs in people with chronic disease. We used data from an internet study, the Japan Society and New Tobacco Internet Survey (JASTIS). We analyzed 9,008 respondents aged 15-73 years in 2019 using logistic regression. Current use of tobacco products was defined as use within the previous 30 days. Prevalence of current HTP use including dual use and dual use with cigarettes was 9.0% and 6.1% respectively in total. By disease: hypertension 10.2% and 7.4%, diabetes 15.9% and 12.3%, CVD 19.2% and 15.7%, COPD 40.5% and 33.3%, and cancer 17.5% and 11.9%. Diabetes, CVD, COPD, and cancer were positively associated with current use of HTPs (odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.48 (1.06, 2.07), 2.29 (1.38, 3.80), 3.97(1.73, 9.11), and 3.58(1.99, 6.44), respectively) and dual use of cigarettes and HTPs (ORs and 95% CIs: 2.23 (1.61, 3.09), 3.58 (2.29, 5.60), 7.46 (3.76, 14.80), and 2.57 (1.46, 4.55), respectively) after adjusting for confounders. People with chronic disease were more likely to use HTPs and HTPs together with cigarettes. Further research on the smoking situation of HTPs in patients with chronic diseases is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3212917995,"Paired associative corticospinal-motoneuronal stimulation (PCMS) induces plasticity at synapses between corticospinal tracts (CSTs) and spinal motoneurons (SMs). We investigated the effects of peripheral nerve electrical stimulation (PNS) intensity on PCMS-induced plasticity. PCMS consisted of 180 paired stimuli of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left primary motor cortex with PNS on the right ulnar nerve at the wrist. We compared effects induced by different PNS intensities: supramaximal, twice and three times sensory threshold intensities. For evaluating efficacy of the synapse between CSTs and SMs, single-pulse TMS was delivered at cervicomedullary junction level, and cervicomedullary motor-evoked potentials (CMEPs) were recorded from the right first-dorsal interosseous muscle before and after PCMS. PCMS with the supramaximal PNS intensity increased CMEP amplitude. The facilitatory effect of PCMS with the supramaximal PNS was larger than those of PCMS with weaker PNS intensities. Sham TMS with the supramaximal PNS showed no CMEP changes after the intervention. PNS intensity of PCMS influences the magnitude of synaptic plasticity induction between the CSTs and SMs at the spinal level, and the supramaximal intensity is the best for induction of long-term potentiation-like effects. The PNS intensity may influence the number of activated SMs by axonal backpropagating pulses with PNS which must overlap with descending volleys induced by TMS."
https://openalex.org/W3214092137,"The T cell expression of various co-signalling receptors from the CD28 immunoglobulin superfamily (Inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS), Programmed cell death 1(PD-1), cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) or from the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily (glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family related (GITR), 4-1BB, and CD27), is essential for T cell responses regulation. Other receptors (such as T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3, T cell immunoglobulin and T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), and lymphocyte activation gene 3) are also involved in this regulation. Disturbance of the balance between activating and inhibitory signals can induce autoimmunity. We have developed an in vitro assay to simultaneously assess the function of naive CD4+ effector T cells (TEFFs), dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T cells (TREGs) and the expression of co-signalling receptors. By running the assay on cells from healthy adult, we investigated the regulation of activated T cell proliferation and phenotypes. We observed that TEFFs activated by DCs mainly expressed BTLA, ICOS and PD-1, whereas activated TREGs mainly expressed TIGIT, ICOS, and CD27. Strikingly, we observed that programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was significantly expressed on both activated TEFFs and TREGs. Moreover, high PD-L1 expression on activated TEFFs was correlated with a higher index of proliferation. Lastly, and in parallel to the TREG-mediated suppression of TEFF proliferation, we observed the specific modulation of the surface expression of PD-L1 (but not other markers) on activated TEFFs. Our results suggest that the regulation of T cell proliferation is correlated with the specific expression of PD-L1 on activated TEFFs."
https://openalex.org/W3211810811,"Many studies have focused on neural changes and neuroplasticity, while the signaling demand for neural modification needs to be explored. In this study, we traced this issue in the organization of brain functional links where the conflictual arrangement of signed links makes a request to change. We introduced the number of frustrations (unsatisfied closed triadic interactions) as a measure for assessing ""requirement to change"" of functional brain network. We revealed that the requirement to change of the resting-state network has a u-shape functionality over the lifespan with a minimum in early adulthood, and it's correlated with the presence of negative links. Also, we discovered that brain negative subnetwork has a special topology with a log-normal degree distribution in all stages, however, its global measures are altered by adulthood. Our results highlight the study of collective behavior of functional negative links as the source of the brain's between-regions conflicts and we propose exploring the attribute of the requirement to change besides other neural change factors."
https://openalex.org/W3212204699,"To determine the optimal soil sample size for microbial community structure analysis, DNA extraction, microbial composition analysis, and diversity assessments were performed using soil sample sizes of 0.2, 1, and 5 g. This study focused on the relationship between soil amount and DNA extraction container volume and the alteration in microbial composition at different taxonomic ranks (order, class, and phylum). Horizontal (0.2 and 1 g) and vertical (5 g) shaking were applied during DNA extraction for practical use in a small laboratory. In the case of the 5 g soil sample, DNA extraction efficiency and the value of α-diversity index fluctuated severely, possibly because of vertical shaking. Regarding the 0.2 and 1 g soil samples, the number of taxa, Shannon-Wiener index, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity were stable and had approximately the same values at each taxonomic rank. However, non-metric multidimensional scaling showed that the microbial compositions of these two sample sizes were different. The higher relative abundance of taxa in the case of the 0.2 g soil sample might indicate that cell wall compositions differentiated the microbial community structures in these two sample sizes due to high shear stress tolerance. The soil sample size and tube volume affected the estimated microbial community structure. A soil sample size of 0.2 g would be preferable to the other sample sizes because of the possible higher shearing force for DNA extraction and lower experimental costs due to smaller amounts of consumables. When the taxonomic rank was changed from order to phylum, some minor taxa identified at the order rank were integrated into major taxa at the phylum rank. The integration affected the value of the β-diversity index; therefore, the microbial community structure analysis, reproducibility of structures, diversity assessment, and detection of minor taxa would be influenced by the taxonomic rank applied."
https://openalex.org/W3212220912,"Coumestrol (CM), a biologically active compound found in Leguminosae plants, provides various human health benefits. To identify easy and effective methods to increase CM content in vegetables, we developed a quantitative analysis method using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Using this method, we found that soybean sprouts (1.76 ± 0.13 μg/g) have high CM contents among nine vegetables and evaluated the difference in CM contents between two organs of the sprouts: cotyledons and hypocotyls. Next, soybean sprouts were cultivated under different light, temperature, and water conditions and their CM contents were evaluated. CM content was higher in hypocotyls (4.11 ± 0.04 μg/g) than in cotyledons. Cultivating soybean sprouts at 24°C enhanced CM content regardless of light conditions, the growth of fungi and bacteria, and sprout color. Thus, we identified methods of soybean sprout cultivation to increase CM content, which may provide health benefits and enhance value."
https://openalex.org/W3212361490,"In the current study, we analyzed the effects of the systemic inflammatory response (SIR) and amyloid β (Aβ) peptide on the expression of genes encoding cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) in: (i) PC12 cells overexpressing human beta amyloid precursor protein (βAPP), wild-type (APPwt-PC12), or carrying the Swedish mutantion (APPsw-PC12); (ii) the murine hippocampus during SIR; and (iii) Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain. In APPwt-PC12 expression of cyclin D2 (cD2) was exclusively reduced, and in APPsw-PC12 cyclins cD2 and also cA1 were down-regulated, but cA2, cB1, cB2, and cE1 were up-regulated. In the SIR cD2, cB2, cE1 were found to be significantly down-regulated and cD3, Cdk5, and Cdk7 were significantly up-regulated. Cyclin cD2 was also found to be down-regulated in AD neocortex and hippocampus. Our novel data indicate that Aβ peptide and inflammation both significantly decreased the expression of cD2, suggesting that Aβ peptides may also contribute to downregulation of cD2 in AD brain."
https://openalex.org/W3212735865,"Screening for genital infection (GI) such as bacterial vaginosis (BV) and yeast infection, for sexually transmitted infection (STI), and for asymptomatic carriage of group B streptococcus (GBS) in pregnant women are common reason for medical appointments. The diagnosis and control of GIs, STIs, and GBS are major issues, for fertility and overall well-being of affected women. Conventional testing is performed using vaginal/cervical classical sampling (VCS); this procedure requires pelvic examination performed by health care professionals which raises concerns among women. Vaginal-self-sampling (VSS), as an alternative to VCS, might capture more women. The aim was first to show non-inferiority of VSS compared with VCS to screen for GIs, STIs, and GBS; second to determine the feasibility of VSS.VSS and VCS from 1027 women were collected by health care professionals and simultaneously carried out on each patient. GIs, STIs, and GBS were systematically screened in both paired VSS and VCS samples. Non-inferiority of VSS compared with VCS was assessed using z statistic for binomial proportions.Prevalence of GIs were 39.7% using VSS and 38.1% using VCS (p = 0.0016). Prevalence of STIs was 8.5% (VSS) vs 8.1% (VCS) (p = 0.0087). Prevalence of GBS was 13.4% (VSS) and 11.5% (VCS) (p = 0.0001). Most participants (84%) recommended the use of VSS.This study shows that VSS was not inferior to VCS for the detection of GIs, STIs, and GBS. This study provides evidence that VSS can be used as a universal specimen for detection of lower genital tract infections in women.ID-RCB 2014-A01250-4."
https://openalex.org/W3213612800,"Although small in size, insects are a quintessential part of terrestrial ecosystems due to their large number and diversity. While captured insects can be thoroughly studied in laboratory conditions, their population dynamics and abundance in the wild remain largely unknown due to the lack of accurate methodologies to count them. Here, we present the results of a field experiment where the activity of insects has been monitored continuously over 3 months using an entomological stand-off optical sensor (ESOS). Because its near-infrared laser is imperceptible to insects, the instrument provides an unbiased and absolute measurement of the aerial density (flying insect/m 3 ) with a temporal resolution down to the minute. Multiple clusters of insects are differentiated based on their wingbeat frequency and ratios between wing and body optical cross-sections. The collected data allowed for the study of the circadian rhythm and daily activities as well as the aerial density dynamic over the whole campaign for each cluster individually. These measurements have been compared with traps for validation of this new methodology. We believe that this new type of data can unlock many of the current limitations in the collection of entomological data, especially when studying the population dynamics of insects with large impacts on our society, such as pollinators or vectors of infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3214728734,"To describe the use of large-scale respondent driven sampling (RDS) surveys to demonstrate the ""end of an HIV epidemic"" (HIV incidence < 0.5/100 person-years) among persons who inject drugs (PWID) in a middle-income country. Large sample sizes are needed to convincingly demonstrate very low incidence rates.4 large surveys (Ns approximately 1500 each) were conducted among PWID in Hai Phong, Vietnam in 2016-2019. Respondent driven sampling (RDS) with a modification to add snowball sampling was used for recruiting participants. HIV incidence was measured through recency testing, repeat participants across multiple surveys and in a cohort study of PWID recruited from the surveys. RDS analytics (time to equilibria and homophilies for major variables) were used to assess similarities/differences in RDS only versus RDS plus snowball recruiting. Characteristics were compared among respondents recruited through standard RDS recruitment versus through snowball sampling. An overall assessment of the robustness of RDS to modification was made when adding a snowball sampling recruitment.RDS recruiting was very efficient in the first 5 weeks of each survey with approximately 180 respondents recruited per week. Recruiting then slowed considerably, and snowball sampling (permitting an individual respondent to recruit large numbers of new respondents) was added to the existing RDS recruiting. This led to recruiting within 13-14 weeks of 1383, 1451, 1444 and 1268 respondents, close to the target of 1500 respondents/survey. Comparisons of participants recruited through standard RDS method and respondents recruited through snowball methods showed very few significant differences. RDS analytics (quickly reaching equilibria, low homophilies) were favorable for both RDS recruited and total numbers of participants in each survey. DRug use and Infections in ViEtnam (DRIVE) methods have now been officially adopted in other provinces.RDS appears to be quite robust with respect to adding a modest number of participants recruited through snowball sampling. Large sample sizes can provide compelling evidence for ""ending an HIV epidemic"" to policy makers in a PWID population in a middle income country setting."
https://openalex.org/W3212061784,"Infant Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a poorly-addressed, heterogeneous malignancy distinguished by surprisingly few mutations per patient but accompanied by myriad age-specific translocations. These characteristics make treatment of infant AML challenging. While infant AML is a relatively rare disease, it has enormous impact on families, and in terms of life-years-lost and life limiting morbidities. To better understand the mechanisms that drive infant AML, we performed integrative analyses of genome-wide mRNA, miRNA, and DNA-methylation data in diagnosis-stage patient samples. Here, we report the activation of an onco-fetal B-cell developmental gene regulatory network in infant AML. AML in infants is genomically distinct from AML in older children/adults in that it has more structural genomic aberrations and fewer mutations. Differential expression analysis of ~1500 pediatric AML samples revealed a large number of infant-specific genes, many of which are associated with B cell development and function. 18 of these genes form a well-studied B-cell gene regulatory network that includes the epigenetic regulators BRD4 and POU2AF1, and their onco-fetal targets LIN28B and IGF2BP3. All four genes are hypo-methylated in infant AML. Moreover, micro-RNA Let7a-2 is expressed in a mutually exclusive manner with its target and regulator LIN28B. These findings suggest infant AML may respond to bromodomain inhibitors and immune therapies targeting CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD79A."
https://openalex.org/W3212532785,"Hypertension is more prevalent in African Americans (AA) than other ethnic groups. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with hypertension and other cardio-metabolic traits like type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and body mass index (BMI), however the AA population is underrepresented in these studies. In this study, we examined a large AA cohort for the generalizability of 14 Metabochip array SNPs with previously reported European hypertension associations.To evaluate associations, we analyzed genotype data of 14 SNPs for their associations with a diagnosis of hypertension, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in a case-control study of an AA population (N = 9,534). We also performed an age-stratified analysis (>30, 30≥59 and ≥60 years) following the hypertension definition described by the 8th Joint National Committee (JNC). Associations were adjusted for BMI, age, age2, sex, clinical confounders, and genetic ancestry using multivariable regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and beta-coefficients. Analyses stratified by sex were also conducted. Meta-analyses (including both BioVU and COGENT-BP cohorts) were performed using a random-effects model.We found rs880315 to be associated with systolic hypertension (SBP≥140 mmHg) in the entire cohort (OR = 1.14, p = 0.003) and within women only (OR = 1.16, p = 0.012). Variant rs17080093 associated with lower SBP and DBP (β = -2.99, p = 0.0352 and - β = 1.69, p = 0.0184) among younger individuals, particularly in younger women (β = -3.92, p = 0.0025 and β = -1.87, p = 0.0241 for SBP and DBP respectively). SNP rs1530440 associated with higher SBP and DBP measurements (younger individuals β = 4.1, p = 0.039 and β = 2.5, p = 0.043 for SBP and DBP; (younger women β = 4.5, p = 0.025 and β = 2.9, p = 0.028 for SBP and DBP), and hypertension risk in older women (OR = 1.4, p = 0.050). rs16948048 increases hypertension risk in younger individuals (OR = 1.31, p = 0.011). Among mid-age women rs880315 associated with higher risk of hypertension (OR = 1.20, p = 0.027). rs1361831 associated with DBP (β = -1.96, p = 0.02) among individuals older than 60 years. rs3096277 increases hypertension risk among older individuals (OR = 1.26 p = 0.0015), however, this variant also reduces SBP among younger women (β = -2.63, p = 0.0102).These findings suggest that European-descent and AA populations share genetic loci that contribute to blood pressure traits and hypertension. However, the OR and beta-coefficient estimates differ, and some are age-dependent. Additional genetic studies of hypertension in AA are warranted to identify new loci associated with hypertension and blood pressure traits in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3212623747,"Growth-based determination of pubertal onset timing would be cheap and practical. We aimed to determine this timing based on pubertal growth markers. Secondary aims were to estimate the differences in growth between cohorts and identify the role of overweight in onset timing.This multicohort study includes data from three Finnish cohorts-the Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP, N = 2,825) Study, the Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project (STRIP, N = 711), and the Boy cohort (N = 66). Children were monitored for growth and Tanner staging (except in DIPP).The growth data were analyzed using a Super-Imposition by Translation And Rotation growth curve model, and pubertal onset analyses were run using a time-to-pubertal onset model.The time-to-pubertal onset model used age at peak height velocity (aPHV), peak height velocity (PHV), and overweight status as covariates, with interaction between aPHV and overweight status for girls, and succeeded in determining the onset timing. Cross-validation showed a good agreement (71.0% for girls, 77.0% for boys) between the observed and predicted onset timings. Children in STRIP were taller overall (girls: 1.7 [95% CI: 0.9, 2.5] cm, boys: 1.0 [0.3, 2.2] cm) and had higher PHV values (girls: 0.13 [0.02, 0.25] cm/year, boys: 0.35 [0.21, 0.49] cm/year) than those in DIPP. Boys in the Boy cohort were taller (2.3 [0.3, 4.2] cm) compared with DIPP. Overweight girls showed pubertal onset at 1.0 [0.7, 1.4] year earlier compared with other girls. In boys, there was no such difference.The novel modeling approach provides an opportunity to evaluate the Tanner breast/genital stage-based pubertal onset timing in cohort studies including longitudinal data on growth but lacking pubertal follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3213297495,"The first case of COVID-19 was detected in North Carolina (NC) on March 3, 2020. By the end of April, the number of confirmed cases had soared to over 10,000. NC health systems faced intense strain to support surging intensive care unit admissions and avert hospital capacity and resource saturation. Forecasting techniques can be used to provide public health decision makers with reliable data needed to better prepare for and respond to public health crises. Hospitalization forecasts in particular play an important role in informing pandemic planning and resource allocation. These forecasts are only relevant, however, when they are accurate, made available quickly, and updated frequently. To support the pressing need for reliable COVID-19 data, RTI adapted a previously developed geospatially explicit healthcare facility network model to predict COVID-19’s impact on healthcare resources and capacity in NC. The model adaptation was an iterative process requiring constant evolution to meet stakeholder needs and inform epidemic progression in NC. Here we describe key steps taken, challenges faced, and lessons learned from adapting and implementing our COVID-19 model and coordinating with university, state, and federal partners to combat the COVID-19 epidemic in NC."
https://openalex.org/W3213813884,"Comprehensive testing schemes, followed by adequate contact tracing and isolation, represent the best public health interventions we can employ to reduce the impact of an ongoing epidemic when no or limited vaccine supplies are available and the implications of a full lockdown are to be avoided. However, the process of tracing can prove feckless for highly-contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. The interview-based approaches often miss contacts and involve significant delays, while digital solutions can suffer from insufficient adoption rates or inadequate usage patterns. Here we present a novel way of modelling different contact tracing strategies, using a generalized multi-site mean-field model, which can naturally assess the impact of manual and digital approaches alike. Our methodology can readily be applied to any compartmental formulation, thus enabling the study of more complex pathogen dynamics. We use this technique to simulate a newly-defined epidemiological model, SEIR-T, and show that, given the right conditions, tracing in a COVID-19 epidemic can be effective even when digital uptakes are sub-optimal or interviewers miss a fair proportion of the contacts."
https://openalex.org/W3214141044,"Endogenous ouabain (EO) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are important in regulation of sodium and fluid balance. There is indirect evidence that ANP may be involved in the regulation of endogenous cardenolides.H295R are human adrenocortical cells known to release EO. Cells were treated with ANP at physiologic concentrations or vehicle (0.1% DMSO), with or without guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1,2,4 oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ). Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), the intracellular second messenger of ANP, was measured by a chemiluminescent immunoassay and EO was measured by radioimmunoassay of C18 extracted samples.EO secretion is inhibited by ANP treatment, with the most prolonged inhibition (90 min vs ≤ 60 min) occurring at physiologic ANP concentrations (50 pg/mL). Inhibition of guanylyl cyclase with ODQ, also reduces EO secretion. The inhibitory effects on EO release in response to cotreatment with ANP and ODQ appeared to be additive.ANP inhibits basal EO secretion, and it is unlikely that this is mediated through ANP-A or ANP-B receptors (the most common natriuretic peptide receptors) or their cGMP second messenger; the underlying mechanisms involved are not revealed in the current studies. The role of ANP in the control of EO synthesis and secretion in vivo requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3214283993,"Hyperglycemia is generally considered to be an important cause of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of miR-5195-3p in high glucose (HG)-induced human retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cell injury. Here, we first found that the expression level of miR-5195-3p was significantly downregulated in HG-stimulated ARPE-19 cells using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Overexpression of miR-5195-3p attenuated the impaired cell viability, increased apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion in ARPE-19 cells under HG condition using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry and ELISA assay, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-5195-3p could specifically bind to the 3'UTR of glia maturation factor-β (GMFB). GMFB overexpression reversed, while knockdown enhanced the protective effects of miR-5195-3p overexpression against HG-induced ARPE-19 cell injury. In summary, miR-5195-3p targeting GMFB might be a potential therapeutic target for DR."

Missense mutations of this gene have already been found in patients of CTCL and AITL. The non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) can alter the protein structure as well as its functions. In this study, probable deleterious and disease-related nsSNPs in PLCG1 were identified using SIFT, PROVEAN, PolyPhen-2, PhD-SNP, Pmut, and SNPS&amp;GO tools. Further, their effect on protein stability was checked along with conservation and solvent accessibility analysis by I-mutant 2.0, MUpro, Consurf, and Netsurf 2.0 server. Some SNPs were finalized for structural analysis with PyMol and BIOVIA discovery studio visualizer. Out of the 16 nsSNPs which were found to be deleterious, ten nsSNPs had an effect on protein stability, and six mutations (L411P, R355C, G493D, R1158H, A401V and L455F) were predicted to be highly conserved. Among the six highly conserved mutations, four nsSNPs (R355C, A401V, L411P and L455F) were part of the catalytic domain. L411P, L455F and G493D made significant structural change in the protein structure. Two mutations-Y210C and R1158H had post-translational modification. In the 5’ and 3’ untranslated region, three SNPs, rs139043247, rs543804707, and rs62621919 showed possible miRNA target sites and DNA binding sites. This in silico analysis has provided a structured dataset of PLCG1 gene for further in vivo researches. With the limitation of computational study, it can still prove to be an asset for the identification and treatment of multiple diseases associated with the target gene."
https://openalex.org/W3211662150,"Orchestrated chemical signaling of single cells sounds to be a linchpin of emerging organization and multicellular life form. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a well-studied model organism to explore overall pictures of grouped behavior in developmental biology. The chemical waves secreted by aggregating Dictyostelium is a superb example of pattern formation. The waves are either circular or spiral in shape, according to the incremental population density of a self-aggregating community of individuals. Here, we revisit the spatiotemporal patterns that appear in an excitable medium due to synchronization of randomly firing individuals, but with a more parsimonious attitude. According to our model, a fraction of these individuals are less involved in amplifying external stimulants. Our simulations indicate that the cells enhance the system’s asymmetry and as a result, nucleate early sustainable spiral territory zones, provided that their relative population does not exceed a tolerable threshold."
https://openalex.org/W3211694522,"Study of inflammatory cytokines in patients with caustic gastrointestinal tract injury is sketchy. This study investigated the cytokine profiling of patients with caustic substance ingestion, and analyzed the differences between patients with severe and mild injury.This prospective, cross-sectional study enrolled 22 patients admitted to Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between March and October 2018. All patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy in 24 hours. Patients were categorized into two subgroups, as mild (<2b, n = 11) or severe (≥2b, n = 11) group.The neutrophil count was higher in severe than mild group (P = 0.032). Patients in mild and severe groups exhibited significantly higher circulating inflammatory cytokines than healthy control, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-5, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, IL-13, interferon-gamma inducible protein-10, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, the levels of IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were significantly higher in patients with severe group than mild group. Although there was no difference in cumulative survival between both groups (P = 0.147), the severe group received more operations (P = 0.035) and suffered more gastrointestinal complications (P = 0.035) than mild group.Caustic substance ingestion produces mucosal damages and leads to excessive neutrophils and inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood."
https://openalex.org/W3211890524,"Mainly severe (CTCAE grade 3-4) haematotoxicity during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is reported in literature due to major clinical impact, however moderate (CTCAE grade 2) haematotoxicity is common and could affect therapy management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the haematotoxicity course during PRRT and to compare baseline parameters between haematotoxicity grades.In this retrospective study, 100 patients with a neuroendocrine tumour treated with PRRT were included. Patients were treated with an aimed number of four cycles with 7.4 GBq [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE administered every 10 weeks. Haematological assessment was performed at baseline and frequently up to 10 weeks after the fourth cycle. The lowest haematological value was graded according to CTCAE v5.0, and patients were classified using the highest observed grade. Differences in baseline parameters, including [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE positive tumour volume, were evaluated between CTCAE grades.Four cycles were completed by 86/100 of patients, 4/100 patients discontinued due to haematotoxicity, and 10/100 patients due to progressive disease. The treatment course was adjusted due to haematotoxicity in 24/100 patients, including postponed next cycle (n = 17), reduced administered activity (n = 13), and both adjustments (n = 10). The most observed haematotoxicity grade was grade 0-1 in 54/100 patients, grade 2 in 38/100 and grade 3-4 in 8/100. Significant differences in baseline leucocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts were observed between grade 0-1 and grade 2. However, the correlation between baseline and lowest observed values was poor to moderate. No differences between haematotoxicity grades and baseline parameters or somatostatin receptor positive tumour volume was observed.The incidence of severe haematotoxicity was low with extensive screening and monitoring. The vast majority of patients (96/100) was not restricted in treatment continuation by haematotoxicity; therefore, our selection criteria appeared appropriate for safe PRRT treatment. Baseline parameters showed limited correlation with the degree of decline in haematological values."
https://openalex.org/W3212379759,"Unintentional weight loss (UWL) is defined as unintentional reduction of more than 5% of baseline body weight over 6 to 12 months. UWL is a common problem in the older adults, resulting in increased rate of morbidity and mortality. With specific reference to Thailand, no information on factors associated with UWL in older adults could be traced. The aims of this research were to identify the factors associated with UWL and to assess the common causes of UWL among older adults in the geriatric outpatient clinic of university hospital.A case-control study was conducted from June 1st, 2020 to December 31st, 2020. Eighty older adults aged 60 years or older were enrolled in the UWL group while the non-UWL group consisted of 160 participants. Data collection was performed by structural questionnaire including baseline characteristics, psychosocial factors, health information, lifestyle behaviors, and medications. The factors associated with UWL were analyzed by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Causes of UWL were recorded from electronic medical records.The mean age of the 240 participants was 79.6 years (SD 7.4). Most patients were female (79.2%) and had fewer than 12 years of education (62.6%). The three common causes of UWL were reduced appetite (20.1%), dementia and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (13.7%) and medications (11.0%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score of >1 (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.37-4.73; P = 0.003), vitamin D deficiency (OR 4.01, 95% CI 1.62-9.97; P = 0.003), and hemoglobin level of <12 g/dL (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.32-4.63; P = 0.005) were factors significantly associated with UWL.Factors associated with UWL were CCI score >1, vitamin D deficiency, and hemoglobin level of <12 g/dl. The early detection of these associated factors, reduced appetite, dementia and polypharmacy may be important in UWL prevention in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3212834916,"A great deal of information is contained within archival maps—ranging from historic political boundaries, to mineral resources, to the locations of cultural landmarks. There are many ongoing efforts to preserve and digitize historic maps so that the information contained within them can be stored and analyzed efficiently. A major barrier to such map digitizing efforts is that the geographic location of each map is typically unknown and must be determined through an often slow and manual process known as georeferencing. To mitigate the time costs associated with the georeferencing process, this paper introduces a fully automated method based on map toponym (place name) labels. It is the first study to demonstrate these methods across a wide range of both simulated and real-world maps. We find that toponym-based georeferencing is sufficiently accurate to be used for data extraction purposes in nearly half of all cases. We make our implementation available to the wider research community through fully open-source replication code, as well as an online georeferencing tool, and highlight areas of improvement for future research. It is hoped that the practical implications of this research will allow for larger and more efficient processing and digitizing of map information for researchers, institutions, and the general public."
https://openalex.org/W3212923366,"Chronic inflammation can cause oviduct mucosal damage and immune dysfunction, leading to infertility, early pregnancy loss, ectopic pregnancy, tumors, and a decrease in reproductive capacities in female animals. Estrogen can suppress immune responses in different tissues and oviducts, and regulate the oviduct immune balance; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the mechanism of estrogen-regulated oviduct mucosal immunity and discover new estrogen targets for regulating oviduct mucosal immune homeostasis. Sheep oviduct epithelial cells (SOECs) were treated with 17-β estradiol (E2). Transcriptome sequencing and analysis showed differentially expressed S100 calcium-binding protein A (S100A) genes that may participate in the oviduct mucosa immunoregulation of estrogen. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry analysis showed that S100A8 expression changed dynamically in E2-treated SOECs and peaked after 7 h of treatment. Estrogen nuclear receptors and G protein-coupled membrane receptors promoted E2-dependent S100A8 upregulation. The S100A8 gene was disrupted using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 method. Levels of inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-4 were significantly upregulated in S100A8-knockdown SOECs, whereas those of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 was downregulated. Following S100A8 knockdown in SOECs treated with E2 for 7 h, IL-10 levels increased significantly. Estrogen affected oviduct mucosa immune function and dynamically regulated S100A8 in SOECs. S100A8 knockdown caused an excessive immune response, indicating that S100A8 is beneficial for maintaining immune homeostasis in the oviduct mucosa. Moreover, estrogen can compensate for the effect of S100A8 knockdown by upregulating IL-10."
https://openalex.org/W3213859876,"Occupational welding fumes contain varieties of toxic metal particles and may affect cardiovascular system like the Particulate Matters (PM). Few studies have focused on the effects of toxic metals on the hemodynamic balance; however, the reporting results were not consistent. This study aimed to investigate the association between toxic metals exposure (Chromium (Cr), Manganese (Mn) and Lead (Pb)) and blood hemostatic parameters status after a 3-week exposure cessation among workers exposed to welding fumes.Structured interviews and biological samplings were conducted for 86 male workers without a history of Anemia and Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and working in a confined space to construct crude oil tanks. Metal levels of Cr, Mn and Pb in urine were measured during the working days using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) method. The concentrations of hemostatic proteins in blood (White blood cell counts (WBC), Lymphocytes, Monocyte, Eosinophil, Neutrophil, Hematocrit (Hct) were assessed after a 3 weeks exposure cessation. Workers were divided into groups based on occupation type (welder group and non-welder group), and based on metal levels (high and low exposure groups) for comparison. Linear regression models were used to explore the association between metal exposure and multiple blood hemostatic parameters adjusted for age, Body Mass Index (BMI), and smoking status.Urine Mn and Cr level of the welder group was significantly higher than the non-welder group (Mn: 0.96 VS 0.22 ug/g creatinine, p < 0.001; Cr: 0.63 VS 0.22 ug/g creatinine, p < 0.01). The mean value of Hct in the welder group was 44.58 ± 2.84 vol%, significantly higher than the non-welder group (43.07 ± 3.31 vol%, p = 0.026). The median value of WBC in the high Mn-exposed group (6.93 ± 1.59 X 106 Cell/ml) was significantly lower than the low Mn-exposed group (7.90 ± 2.13 X 106 Cell/ml, p = 0.018). The linear regression analyses showed that there was a significantly negative association between log transformed WBC value and the Mn exposure groups (high and low) after adjusting for age, BMI, and smoking status (β = - 0.049, p = 0.045), but no significant result was found between WBC and occupation types (welder and non-welder) (p > 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis also showed positive association between Hct and occupational types (welder and non-welders) (β = 0.014, p = 0.055). The other hemostatic parameters were not different from controls when divided by occupation type or metal level groups.Our results showed that welders were exposed to about 3 to 4 times higher Mn and Cr concentrations than non-welders. Moreover, one third of the non-welders were exposed to high-exposure groups of Mn and Cr metals. Regression models revealed a significant association of the WBC counts with the Mn exposure group. Therefore, we infer that Mn exposure may play a significant role on the blood hemostatic parameters of workers in the confined space. Hazard identification for non-welders should also be conducted in the confined space."
https://openalex.org/W3214279010,"To better understand the contribution of wildlife to the dissemination of Salmonella and antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella and Escherichia coli, we examined whole-genome sequence data from Salmonella and E. coli isolates collected from raccoons (Procyon lotor) and environmental sources on farms in southern Ontario. All Salmonella and phenotypically resistant E. coli collected from raccoons, soil, and manure pits on five swine farms as part of a previous study were included. We assessed for evidence of potential transmission of these organisms between different sources and farms utilizing a combination of population structure assessments (using core-genome multi-locus sequence typing), direct comparisons of multi-drug resistant isolates, and epidemiological modeling of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and plasmid incompatibility (Inc) types. Univariable logistic regression models were fit to assess the impact of source type, farm location, and sampling year on the occurrence of select resistance genes and Inc types. A total of 159 Salmonella and 96 resistant E. coli isolates were included. A diversity of Salmonella serovars and sequence types were identified, and, in some cases, we found similar or identical Salmonella isolates and resistance genes between raccoons, soil, and swine manure pits. Certain Inc types and resistance genes associated with source type were consistently more likely to be identified in isolates from raccoons than swine manure pits, suggesting that manure pits are not likely a primary source of those particular resistance determinants for raccoons. Overall, our data suggest that transmission of Salmonella and AMR determinants between raccoons and swine manure pits is uncommon, but soil-raccoon transmission appears to be occurring frequently. More comprehensive sampling of farms, and assessment of farms with other livestock species, as well as additional environmental sources (e.g., rivers) may help to further elucidate the movement of resistance genes between these various sources."
https://openalex.org/W3212312815,"Personal relative deprivation (PRD; the belief that one is worse off than other people who are similar to oneself) is associated with a reduced willingness to delay gratification, lower prosociality, and increased materialism. These results suggest that PRD may play a role in shaping people's willingness to act to protect the natural environment. We report 3 studies that investigate a possible link between PRD and pro-environmental intentions (ENV). Study 1 was an exploratory study using a US sample; Studies 2 and 3 were pre-registered replications using UK and US samples, respectively. In each study, participants self-reported PRD and ENV; they also indicated their subjective social status (where they come on a national ""ladder"" of social class) and reported their income, education, age, and gender/sex. All three studies found a negative correlation between PRD and ENV. However, multiple regression analyses in which ENV was regressed on PRD and all other variables simultaneously indicated that the unique effect of PRD was small and, for Studies 2 and 3, the 95% confidence intervals included zero. No other variable emerged as a clear unique predictor across all three studies. The data suggest that PRD may be associated with reduced intention to act pro-environmentally, but the causal status of this association, and its relationship to other demographic and social-status variables, remains a topic for further research."
https://openalex.org/W3212929802,"Cigarette butts are known to contain toxic metals which pose a potential threat to the environment and human health. The seriousness of this threat is largely determined by the leachability of these toxic metals when the butts are exposed to aqueous solutions in the environment. The aims of this study were to determine the presence and mobility of toxic and non-toxic elements found in discarded cigarette butts; to relate this mobility to two different contact situations with leaching liquids: tumbling and trampling (batch test) and percolation in a static position (column test); and finally, to verify possible variations in solubility by simulating different environmental systems. Five leachants with different pH values were used to simulate various environmental conditions The concentrations of the solubilized metals were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). CH 3 COOH pH 2.5 showed the greatest capacity to dissolve many elements. On the contrary, weakly acidic or alkaline environments did not favor the leachability of the elements. The best extraction capacity of the column with respect to the batch is statistically significant (p &lt;0.05) for the elements Al, Fe, Ni and Zn, while the batch for P, Si, S. Pb, Cd, As were not detectable in cigarette butts, while Hg had an average concentration of 0.0502 μ g/g. However, Hg was &lt; LOD in all different leachants."
https://openalex.org/W3213331909,"Aerobic fitness (AF) and lipoprotein subclasses associate to each other and to cardiovascular health. Adiposity and physical activity (PA) influence the association pattern of AF to lipoproteins almost inversely making it difficult to assess their independent and joint influence on the association pattern. This study, including 841 children (50% boys) 10.2 ± 0.3 years old with BMI 18.0 ± 3.0 kg/m2 from rural Western Norway, aimed at examining the association pattern of AF to the lipoprotein subclasses and to estimate the independent and joint influence of PA and adiposity on this pattern. We used multivariate analysis to determine the association pattern of a profile of 26 lipoprotein features to AF with and without adjustment for three measures of adiposity and a high-resolution PA descriptor of 23 intensity intervals derived from accelerometry. For data not adjusted for adiposity or PA, we observed a cardioprotective lipoprotein pattern associating to AF. This pattern withstood adjustment for PA, but the strength of association to AF was reduced by 58%, while adjustment for adiposity weakened the association of AF to the lipoproteins by 85% and with strongest changes in the associations to a cardioprotective high-density lipoprotein subclass pattern. When adjusted for both adiposity and PA, the cardioprotective lipoprotein pattern still associated to AF, but the strength of association was reduced by 90%. Our results imply that the (negative) influence of adiposity on the cardioprotective association pattern of lipoproteins to AF is considerably stronger than the (positive) contribution of PA to this pattern. However, our analysis shows that PA contributes also indirectly through a strong inverse association to adiposity. The trial was registered 7 May, 2014 in clinicaltrials.gov with trial reg. no.: NCT02132494 and the URL is https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02132494&cntry=NO."

https://openalex.org/W3213599571,"Background Treatment options for mitral regurgitation range from diuretic therapy, to surgical and interventional strategies including TMVR in high-risk surgical candidates. Frailty has been associated with inferior outcomes following hospitalizations for heart failure and in open cardiac surgery. Objective The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the impact of frailty on clinical outcomes and resource use following transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR). Methods Adults undergoing TMVR were identified using the 2016–2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database, and divided into Frail and Non-Frail groups. Frailty was defined using a derivative of the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty indicator. Generalized linear models were used to assess the association of frailty with in-hospital mortality, complications, nonhome discharge, hospitalization costs, length of stay, and non-elective readmission at 90 days. Average marginal effects were used to quantify the impact of frailty on predicted mortality. Results Of 18,791 patients undergoing TMVR, 11.6% were considered frail. The observed mortality rate for the overall cohort was 2.2%. After adjustment, frailty was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality (AOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.6), corresponding to an absolute increase in risk of mortality of 1.1%. Frailty was associated with a 2.7-day (95% CI 2.1–3.2) increase in postoperative LOS, and $18,300 (95% CI 14,400–22,200) increment in hospitalization costs. Frail patients had greater odds (4.4, 95% CI 3.6–5.4) of nonhome discharge but similar odds of non-elective 90-day readmission. Conclusions Frailty is independently associated with inferior short-term clinical outcomes and greater resource use following TMVR. Inclusion of frailty into existing risk models may better inform choice of therapy and shared decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W3213750703,"Historically, surgical bilioenteric bypass was the only treatment option for extrahepatic bile duct obstruction, but with technological advancements, percutaneous transhepatic drainage (PTD) and endoscopic solutions were introduced as a less invasive alternative. Endoscopic methods may lead to a decreasing indication of PTD in the future, but today it is still the standard treatment method, especially in hilar obstructions.In our retrospective data analysis, we assessed technical success rate, reintervention rate, morbidity, mortality, and the learning curve of patients treated with PTD over 12 years in a tertiary referral center.599 patients were treated with 615 percutaneous interventions. 94.5% (566/599) technical success rate; 2.7% (16/599) reintervention rate were achieved. 111 minor and 22 major complications occurred including 1 case of death. In perihilar obstruction, cholangitis were significantly more frequent in cases where endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography had also been performed prior to PTD compared to PTD alone, with 39 (18.2%) and 15 (10.5%) occurrences, respectively.The results and especially the excellent success rates demonstrate that PTD is safe and effective, and it is appropriate for first choice in the treatment algorithm of perihilar stenosis. Ultimately, we concluded that PTD should be performed in experienced centers to achieve low mortality, morbidity, and high success rates."
https://openalex.org/W3213795590,"To measure medicines' prices, availability, and affordability in Hanam, Vietnam.The standardized methodology developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Action International was used to survey 30 essential medicines (EMs) in 30 public health facilities and 35 private medicine outlets in 2020. The availability of medicine was computed as the percentage of health facilities in which this medicine was found on the data-collection day. International reference prices (IRPs) from Management Sciences for Health (2015) were used to compute Median Price Ratio (MPR). The affordability of treatments for common diseases was computed as the number of days' wages of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker needed to purchase medicines prescribed at a standard dose. Statistic analysis was done using R software version 4.1.1.The mean availability of originator brands (OBs) and lowest-priced generics (LPGs) was 0.7%, 63.2% in the public sector, and 13.7%, 47.9% in the private sector, respectively. In private medicine outlets, the mean availability of both OBs and LPGs in urban areas was significantly higher than that in rural areas (p = 0.0013 and 0.0306, respectively). In the public sector, LPGs' prices were nearly equal to their IRPs (median MPRs = 0.95). In the private medicine outlets, OBs were generally sold at 6.24 times their IRPs while this figure for LPGs was 1.65. The affordability of LPGs in both sectors was good for all conditions, with standard treatments costing a day's wage or less.In both sectors, generic medicines were the predominant product type available. The availability of EMs was fairly high but still lower than WHO's benchmark. A national-scale study should be conducted to provide a comprehensive picture of the availability, prices, and affordability of EMs, thereby helping the government to identify the urgent priorities and improving access to EMs in Vietnam."
https://openalex.org/W3211585657,"It is well known that prolonged bed rest induces muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular deconditioning, bone loss, a loss of functional capacity, and the development of insulin resistance. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is anticipated to be an interventional strategy for disuse due to bed rest. A hybrid training system (HTS), synchronized neuromuscular electrical stimulation for voluntary exercise using an articular motion sensor, may increase the exercise load though bed rest. We assessed oxygen uptake or heart rate during knee bending exercise in the supine position on a bed both simultaneously combined with HTS and without HTS to evaluate exercise intensity on different days in ten healthy subjects (8 men and 2 women) by a randomized controlled crossover trial. The values of relative oxygen uptake during knee bending exercise with HTS were significantly greater than those during knee bending exercise without HTS (7.29 ± 0.91 ml/kg/min vs. 8.29 ± 1.06 ml/kg/min; p = 0.0115). That increment with HTS was a mean of 14.42 ± 13.99%. Metabolic equivalents during knee bending exercise with HTS and without HTS were 2.08 ± 0.26 and 2.39 ± 0.30, respectively. The values of heart rate during knee bending exercise with HTS were significantly greater than those during knee bending exercise without HTS (80.82 ± 9.19 bpm vs. 86.36 ± 5.50 bpm; p = 0.0153). HTS could increase exercise load during knee bending exercise which is easy to implement on a bed. HTS might be a useful technique as a countermeasure against the disuse due to bed rest, for example during acute care or the quarantine for infection prophylaxis."

Hazards ratios were calculated between DSA and transplant center tertiles, stratified by MELD score, to determine differences in inactive to active transition probabilities.7,625 (30.2% of sample registrants;25,216 total) experienced at least one inactive status change in the DSA-level cohort and 7,623 experienced at least one inactive status change in the transplant-center level cohort (30.2% of sample registrants;25,211 total). Inactive patients with MELD≤34 had a higher probability of becoming re-activated if they were waitlisted in a low or medium MMaT transplant center or DSA. Transplant rates were higher and lower re-activation probability was associated with higher mortality for the MELD 26-34 group in the high MMaT tertile. There were no significant differences in re-activation, transplant probability, or waitlist mortality for inactivated patients with MELD≥35 regardless of a DSA's or center's MMaT.This study shows that an inactive status change is independently associated with waitlist mortality. This association differs by a centers' and a DSAs' MMaT. Prioritization through care coordination to resolve issues of inactivity is fundamental to improving access."
https://openalex.org/W3212118754,"The province of Sindh reported the first COVID-19 case in Pakistan on 26 th February 2020. The Government of Sindh has employed numerous control measures to limit its spread. However, for low-and middle-income countries such as Pakistan, the management protocols for controlling a pandemic are not always as definitive as they would be in other developed nations. Given the dire socio-economic conditions of Sindh, continuation of province-wise lockdowns may inadvertently cause a potential economic breakdown. By using a data driven SEIR modelling framework, this paper describes the evolution of the epidemic projections because of government control measures. The data from reported COVID-19 prevalence and google mobility is used to parameterize the model at different time points. These time points correspond to the government’s call for advice on the prerequisite actions required to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in Sindh. Our model predicted the epidemic peak to occur by 18 th June 2020 with approximately 3500 reported cases at that peak, this projection correlated with the actual recorded peak during the first wave of the disease in Sindh. The impact of the governmental control actions and religious ceremonies on the epidemic profile during this first wave of COVID-19 are clearly reflected in the model outcomes through variations in the epidemic peaks. We also report these variations by displaying the trajectory of the epidemics had the control measures been guided differently; the epidemic peak may have occurred as early as the end of May 2020 with approximately 5000 reported cases per day had there been no control measures and as late as August 2020 with only around 2000 cases at the peak had the lockdown continued, nearly flattening the epidemic curve."
https://openalex.org/W3212494857,"Maternal smoking is established to cause adverse birth outcomes, but evidence considering maternal smoking change across successive pregnancies is sparse. We examined the association between self-reported maternal smoking during and between the first two pregnancies with the odds of small for gestational age (SGA) birth (<10th percentile) in the second infant. Records for the first two pregnancies for 16791 women within the SLOPE (Studying Lifecourse Obesity PrEdictors) study were analysed. This is a population-based cohort of prospectively collected anonymised antenatal and birth healthcare data (2003-2018) in Hampshire, UK. Logistic regression was used to relate maternal smoking change to the odds of SGA birth in the second infant. In the full sample, compared to never smokers, mothers smoking at the start of the first pregnancy had higher odds of SGA birth in the second pregnancy even where they stopped smoking before the first antenatal appointment for the second pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.50 [95% confidence interval 1.10, 2.03]). If a mother was not a smoker at the first antenatal appointment for either her first or her second pregnancy, but smoked later in her first pregnancy or between pregnancies, there was no evidence of increased risk of SGA birth in the second pregnancy compared to never smokers. A mother who smoked ten or more cigarettes a day at the start of both of her first two pregnancies had the highest odds of SGA birth (3.54 [2.55, 4.92]). Women who were not smoking at the start of the first pregnancy but who subsequently resumed/began smoking and smoked at the start of their second pregnancy, also had higher odds (2.11 [1.51, 2.95]) than never smokers. Smoking in the first pregnancy was associated with SGA birth in the second pregnancy, even if the mother quit by the confirmation of her second pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3212497885,"This post-trial data linkage analysis was to utilize the data of Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) participants linked with their Medicare data to examine the risk of hospitalized and non-hospitalized gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding associated with antihypertensives.ALLHAT was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial conducted in a total of 42,418 participants aged ≥55 years with hypertension in 623 North American centers. Data for ALLHAT participants who were aged at ≥65 have been linked with their Medicare claims data.A total of 16,676 patients (4,480 for lisinopril, 4,537 for amlodipine, and 7,659 for chlorthalidone) with complete Medicare claims data were available for the final analysis.The cumulative incidences through March 31, 2002 of hospitalized GI bleeding were 5.4%, 5.8% and 5.4% for amlodipine, lisinopril, and chlorthalidone arms, respectively, but were not statistically significant among the 3 arms after adjusting for confounders in Cox regression models. The cumulative incidences of non-hospitalized GI bleeding were also similar across the 3 arms (12.0%, 12.2% and 12.0% for amlodipine, lisinopril, and chlorthalidone, respectively). The increased risk of GI bleeding by age was statistically significant after adjusting for confounders (HR = 1.04 per year, 95% CI: 1.03-1.05). Smokers also had a significantly higher risk of having hospitalized GI bleeding (1.45, 1.19-1.76). Hispanics, those who used aspirin or atenolol in-trial, had diabetes, more education, and a history of stroke had a significantly lower risk of having GI bleeding than their counterparts. Other factors such as gender, history of CHD, prior antihypertensive use, use of estrogen in women, and obesity did not have significant effects on the risk of GI bleeding.There were no statistically significant differences on the risk of hospitalized or non-hospitalized GI bleeding among the 3 ALLHAT trial arms (amlodipine, lisinopril, and chlorthalidone) during the entire in-trial follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3213395736,"In this paper we assess the impact of the recent European recession on stillbirth indices over the course of the 2000s and 2010s; the analysis focuses on four Southern European countries (Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal), which were seriously affected by the sovereign debt crisis from around 2008 to 2017. We use national vital statistics and established economic indicators for the period 2000-2017; stillbirth ratios (stillbirths per 1000 livebirths) are the chosen response variable. For the purpose of the study, we employ correlation analysis and fit regression models. The overall impact of economic indicators on the stillbirth indices is sizeable and statistically robust. We find that a healthy economy is associated with low and declining levels of stillbirth measures. In contrast, economic recession appears to have an adverse effect (Greece, Italy and Spain), or an unclear impact (Portugal), on the stillbirth outcome. This study provides evidence of the adverse effect of the European sovereign debt crisis and ensuing period of austerity on a scarcely explored aspect of health."
https://openalex.org/W3213398905,"SARS-CoV-2 viral attachment and entry into host cells is mediated by a direct interaction between viral spike glycoproteins and membrane bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The receptor binding motif (RBM), located within the S1 subunit of the spike protein, incorporates the majority of known ACE2 contact residues responsible for high affinity binding and associated virulence. Observation of existing crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (SRBD)-ACE2 interface, combined with peptide array screening, allowed us to define a series of linear native RBM-derived peptides that were selected as potential antiviral decoy sequences with the aim of directly binding ACE2 and attenuating viral cell entry. RBM1 (16mer): S443KVGGNYNYLYRLFRK458, RBM2A (25mer): E484GFNCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGYQPY508, RBM2B (20mer): F456NCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGY505 and RBM2A-Sc (25mer): NYGLQGSPFGYQETPYPFCNFVQYG. Data from fluorescence polarisation experiments suggested direct binding between RBM peptides and ACE2, with binding affinities ranging from the high nM to low μM range (Kd = 0.207-1.206 μM). However, the RBM peptides demonstrated only modest effects in preventing SRBD internalisation and showed no antiviral activity in a spike protein trimer neutralisation assay. The RBM peptides also failed to suppress S1-protein mediated inflammation in an endogenously expressing ACE2 human cell line. We conclude that linear native RBM-derived peptides are unable to outcompete viral spike protein for binding to ACE2 and therefore represent a suboptimal approach to inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 viral cell entry. These findings reinforce the notion that larger biologics (such as soluble ACE2, 'miniproteins', nanobodies and antibodies) are likely better suited as SARS-CoV-2 cell-entry inhibitors than short-sequence linear peptides."
https://openalex.org/W3213424117,"Turtle body size is associated with demographic and other traits like mating success, reproductive output, maturity, and survival. As such, growth analyses are valuable for testing life history theory, demographic modeling, and conservation planning. Two important but unsettled research areas relate to growth after maturity and growth rate variation. If individuals exhibit indeterminate growth after maturity, older adults may have an advantage in fecundity, survival, or both over younger/smaller adults. Similarly, depending on how growth varies, a portion of the population may mature earlier, grow larger, or both. We used 23-years of capture-mark-recapture data to study growth and maturity in the Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata), a species suffering severe population declines and for which demographic data are needed for development of effective conservation and management strategies. There was strong support for models incorporating sex as a factor, with the interval growth model reparametrized for capture-mark-recapture data producing later mean maturation estimates than the age-based growth model. We found most individuals (94%) continued growing after maturity, but the instantaneous relative annual plastral growth rate was low. We recommend future studies examine the possible contribution of such slow, continued adult growth to fecundity and survival. Even seemingly negligible amounts of annual adult growth can have demographic consequences affecting the population vital rates for long-lived species."
https://openalex.org/W3213456075,"In hydrological modelling, a good result for the criterion of goodness of fit does not always imply that the hypothesis of mass conservation is fulfilled, and models can lose their essential physical soundness. We propose a way for detecting this anomaly by accounting the resulting water balance during model simulation and use it to modulate the obtained goodness of fit. We call this anomaly in water balance as “inner balance error of the model”. To modulate the goodness of fit values, a penalty function that depends on this error is proposed. In addition, this penalty function is introduced into a multi-criteria objective function, which is also tested. This procedure was followed in modelling the Headwater of the Tagus River (Spain), applying the monthly abcd water balance model. Modulation of the goodness of fit allowed for detecting balance errors in the modelling, revealing that in the simulation of some catchments the model tends to accumulate water in, or release water from, the reservoir that simulates groundwater storage. Although the proposed multi-criteria objective function solves the inner balance error for most catchments, in some cases the error cannot be corrected, indicating that any error in the input and output data is probably related to groundwater flows."
https://openalex.org/W3214057032,"Share pledging has become popular as a method of loan collateral among Chinese shareholders. Our research used a sample of Chinese listed firms between 2008–2018 and produced two main findings. Firstly, we found a negative association between stock price risk and firm profitability. Our second finding was that the interaction effect of share pledging and stock price risk is greater on firm profitability than the effect of stock price risk itself. We examined the role of share pledging by modeling pooled OLS and fixed effects using share pledging behavior, controlling shareholders’ share pledging and the share pledging ratio to reinforce the robustness of our results. Furthermore, we investigated the Davis Double Play effect of share pledging to analyze how share pledging affects stock price risk. We found that higher EPS and investor expectations cannot mitigate the positive impact of share pledging on stock price risk. That is, the reduction of EPS and the deterioration of investor expectations caused by share pledging risk will not further aggravate the stock price risk, as shareholders may have taken some managerial actions to affect the transmission mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3214603344,"The C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is G protein-coupled receptor that upon binding to its cognate ligand, can lead to tumor progression. Several CXCR4-targeted therapies are currently under investigation, and with it comes the need for imaging agents capable of accurate depiction of CXCR4 for therapeutic stratification and monitoring. PET agents enjoy the most success, but more cost-effective and radiation-free approaches such as ultrasound (US) imaging could represent an attractive alternative. In this work, we developed a targeted microbubble (MB) for imaging of vascular CXCR4 expression in cancer. A CXCR4-targeted MB was developed through incorporation of the T140 peptide into the MB shell. Binding properties of the T140-MB and control, non-targeted MB (NT-MB) were evaluated in MDA-MB-231 cells where CXCR4 expression was knocked-down (via shRNA) through optical imaging, and in the lymphoma tumor models U2932 and SuDHL8 (high and low CXCR4 expression, respectively) by US imaging. PET imaging of [18F]MCFB, a tumor-penetrating CXCR4-targeted small molecule, was used to provide whole-tumor CXCR4 readouts. CXCR4 expression and microvessel density were performed by immunohistochemistry analysis and western blot. T140-MB were formed with similar properties to NT-MB and accumulated sensitively and specifically in cells according to their CXCR4 expression. In NOD SCID mice, T140-MB persisted longer in tumors than NT-MB, indicative of target interaction, but showed no difference between U2932 and SuDHL8. In contrast, PET imaging with [18F]MCFB showed a marked difference in tumor uptake at 40-60 min post-injection between the two tumor models (p<0.05). Ex vivo analysis revealed that the large differences in CXCR4 expression between the two models are not reflected in the vascular compartment, where the MB are restricted; in fact, microvessel density and CXCR4 expression in the vasculature was comparable between U2932 and SuDHL8 tumors. In conclusion, we successfully developed a T140-MB that can be used for imaging CXCR4 expression in the tumor vasculature."
