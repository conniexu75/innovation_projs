https://openalex.org/W4283831060,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 have surged notably to become dominant in the United States and South Africa, respectively 1,2 . These new subvariants carrying further mutations in their spike proteins raise concerns that they may further evade neutralizing antibodies, thereby further compromising the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutic monoclonals. We now report findings from a systematic antigenic analysis of these surging Omicron subvariants. BA.2.12.1 is only modestly (1.8-fold) more resistant to sera from vaccinated and boosted individuals than BA.2. However, BA.4/5 is substantially (4.2-fold) more resistant and thus more likely to lead to vaccine breakthrough infections. Mutation at spike residue L452 found in both BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 facilitates escape from some antibodies directed to the so-called class 2 and 3 regions of the receptor-binding domain 3 . The F486V mutation found in BA.4/5 facilitates escape from certain class 1 and 2 antibodies but compromises the spike affinity for the viral receptor. The R493Q reversion mutation, however, restores receptor affinity and consequently the fitness of BA.4/5. Among therapeutic antibodies authorized for clinical use, only bebtelovimab retains full potency against both BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5. The Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, successively yielding subvariants that are not only more transmissible but also more evasive to antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W4283834343,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy1,2 and promotes cardiometabolic health3. Loss of BAT during obesity and ageing is a principal hurdle for BAT-centred obesity therapies, but not much is known about BAT apoptosis. Here, untargeted metabolomics demonstrated that apoptotic brown adipocytes release a specific pattern of metabolites with purine metabolites being highly enriched. This apoptotic secretome enhances expression of the thermogenic programme in healthy adipocytes. This effect is mediated by the purine inosine that stimulates energy expenditure in brown adipocytes by the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A signalling pathway. Treatment of mice with inosine increased BAT-dependent energy expenditure and induced 'browning' of white adipose tissue. Mechanistically, the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1, SLC29A1) regulates inosine levels in BAT: ENT1-deficiency increases extracellular inosine levels and consequently enhances thermogenic adipocyte differentiation. In mice, pharmacological inhibition of ENT1 as well as global and adipose-specific ablation enhanced BAT activity and counteracted diet-induced obesity, respectively. In human brown adipocytes, knockdown or blockade of ENT1 increased extracellular inosine, which enhanced thermogenic capacity. Conversely, high ENT1 levels correlated with lower expression of the thermogenic marker UCP1 in human adipose tissues. Finally, the Ile216Thr loss of function mutation in human ENT1 was associated with significantly lower body mass index and 59% lower odds of obesity for individuals carrying the Thr variant. Our data identify inosine as a metabolite released during apoptosis with a 'replace me' signalling function that regulates thermogenic fat and counteracts obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4283789731,"Abstract Zebrafish, a popular organism for studying embryonic development and for modeling human diseases, has so far lacked a systematic functional annotation program akin to those in other animal models. To address this, we formed the international DANIO-CODE consortium and created a central repository to store and process zebrafish developmental functional genomic data. Our data coordination center ( https://danio-code.zfin.org ) combines a total of 1,802 sets of unpublished and re-analyzed published genomic data, which we used to improve existing annotations and show its utility in experimental design. We identified over 140,000 cis -regulatory elements throughout development, including classes with distinct features dependent on their activity in time and space. We delineated the distinct distance topology and chromatin features between regulatory elements active during zygotic genome activation and those active during organogenesis. Finally, we matched regulatory elements and epigenomic landscapes between zebrafish and mouse and predicted functional relationships between them beyond sequence similarity, thus extending the utility of zebrafish developmental genomics to mammals."

https://openalex.org/W4285740597,"The acute effects of exercise on metabolic energy expenditure and inflammation are well studied, but the long-term effects of regular daily physical activity on metabolic and endocrine effects are less clear. Further, prior studies investigating the impact of daily physical activity in large cohorts have generally relied on self-reported activity. Here, we used the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to investigate the relationship between daily physical activity and both thyroid and immune activity. Daily physical activity was assessed through accelerometry or accelerometry-validated survey responses. Thyroid activity was assessed from circulating levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4). Immune function was assessed from circulating cytokines (C-reactive protein [CRP], immunoglobulin E [IgE], fibrinogen) and blood cell counts. In general linear models including body mass index, age, gender, activity and TSH as factors, active adults had a lower levels of T4 and reduced slope of the TSH:T4 relationship. Similarly, greater physical activity was associated with lower CRP and fibrinogen levels (but not IgE) and lower white blood cell, basophil, monocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil (but not lymphocyte) counts. Daily physical activity was also associated with lower prevalence of clinically elevated CRP, WBC, and lymphocytes in a dose-response manner. These results underscore the long-term impact of daily physical activity on both systemic metabolic activity (thyroid) and on specific physiological tasks (immune). The regulatory effects of physical activity on other bodily systems are clinically relevant and should be incorporated into public health strategies promoting exercise."
https://openalex.org/W4283834957,"Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is a copper-dependent monoamine oxidase whose primary function is the covalent cross-linking of collagen in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Evidence has shown that LOX is associated with cancer and some fibrotic conditions. We recently found that serum LOX is a potential diagnostic biomarker for renal fibrosis, but the mechanism by which LOX is regulated and contributes to renal fibrosis remains unknown. The current study demonstrates the following: (1) LOX expression was increased in fibrotic kidneys including ischemia-reperfusion injury-(IRI-), unilateral ureteral obstruction-(UUO-), and folic acid- (FA-) induced fibrotic kidneys as well as in the paraffin-embedded sections of human kidneys from the patients with renal fibrosis. (2) The increasing deposition and cross-linking of collagen induced by LOX was observed in IRI-, UUO- and FA-kidneys. (3) LOX was regulated by the β-arrestin-ERK-STAT3 pathway in renal fibrosis. STAT3 was the downstream of AT1R-β-arrestin-ERK, ERK entered the nucleus and activated STAT3-pY705 but not STAT3-pS727. (4) STAT3 nuclear subtranslocation and binding to the LOX promoter may be responsible for the upregulation of LOX expression. (5) Pharmacologic inhibition of LOX with BAPN in vivo inhibited the upregulation of LOX, decreased collagen over cross-linking and ameliorated renal fibrosis after ischemic injury. Collectively, these observations suggest that LOX plays an essential role in the development of renal fibrosis by catalyzing collagen over cross-linking. Thus, strategies targeting LOX could be a new avenue in developing therapeutics against renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4285739728,"Plastic pollution of the oceans has long been an ongoing and growing problem. Single-use plastic (plastic bags and microbeads) is responsible for most of this pollution. In recent years, studies have highlighted the importance of the size of plastic particles, and the impact of this pollution source on the environment. We determined the concentration of small marine plastics in seawater, sediments and beach sand around a pristine reef area (Republic of Palau) using very simple tools (plankton net, sieves, organic matter degradation, density separation, Nile red fluorochrome). In this study, we succeeded in detecting microplastic (MPs) particles and microplastic fibers, but also nanoplastic (NPs). These three types of particles were found in all samples with a large heterogeneity, from 0.01 to 0.09 particles L-1 and 0.17 to 32.13 particles g-1 DW for MPs in seawater, sediments and sand, respectively. Even when NPs were identified, the amounts of NPs were underestimated and varied from 0.09 to 0.43 particles L -1 in seawater and from 1.08 to 71.02 particles g -1 DW in sediment and sand, respectively. These variations could be attributed to the environmental characteristics of the different sites. This study shows that plastic pollution must be considered in environmental studies even in the most pristine locations. It also shows that NPs pollution is related to the amount of MPs found at the sites. To understand the effects of this plastic pollution, it is necessary that the next toxicological studies take into account the effects of this fraction that makes up the NPs."
https://openalex.org/W4285744335,"This study describes osteopathic practise activity, scope of practice and the osteopathic patient profile in order to understand the role osteopathy plays within the United Kingdom's (UK) health system a decade after our previous survey.We used a retrospective questionnaire survey design to ask about osteopathic practice and audit patient case notes. All UK registered osteopaths were invited to participate in the survey. The survey was conducted using a web-based system. Each participating osteopath was asked about themselves, their practice and asked to randomly select and extract data from up to 8 random new patient health records during 2018. All patient related data were anonymised.The survey response rate was 500 osteopaths (9.4% of the profession) who provided information about 395 patients and 2,215 consultations. Most osteopaths were self-employed (81.1%; 344/424 responses) working alone either exclusively or often (63.9%; 237/371) and were able to offer 48.6% of patients an appointment within 3 days (184/379). Patient ages ranged from 1 month to 96 years (mean 44.7 years, Std Dev. 21.5), of these 58.4% (227/389) were female. Infants <1 years old represented 4.8% (18/379) of patients. The majority of patients presented with musculoskeletal complaints (81.0%; 306/378). Persistent complaints (present for more than 12 weeks before appointment) were the most common (67.9%; 256/377) and 41.7% (156/374) of patients had co-existing medical conditions. The most common treatment approaches used at the first appointment were soft-tissue techniques (73.9%; 292/395), articulatory techniques (69.4%; 274/395) and high velocity low amplitude thrust (34.4%; 136/395). The mean number of treatments per patient was 7 (mode 4).Osteopaths predominantly provide care of musculoskeletal conditions, typically in private practice. To better understand the role of osteopathy in UK health service delivery, the profession needs to do more research with patients in order to understand their needs and their expected outcomes of care, and for this to inform osteopathic practice and education."
https://openalex.org/W4283832222,"This study aims to characterize and compare the feeding ecology of the European eels ( Anguilla anguilla L.) during the continental phase (i.e. yellow and silver) along a salinity gradient (i.e. lower, middle and upper) in six northern France estuaries (i.e. brackish water). The diet and stable isotopic (i.e. δ 15 N and δ 13 C values) compositions of eels collected with a fyke net in six estuaries (Slack, Wimereux, Liane, Canche, Authie and Somme estuaries) located along the French coast of the eastern English Channel per season over a year were described by combining gut content and stable isotope analyses. Eel guts were dominated by typical BW prey, Malacostraca and Actinopterygii (54% and 40%, respectively), with the gammare Gammarus zaddachi and the green crab Carcinus maenas (38% and 14%, respectively), and smaller yellow eels of A . anguilla and juvenile European flounder, Platichthys flesus (19% and 14%, respectively) being the most frequently found in their guts. The δ 13 C values of a majority of eels confirmed the sea- and brackish water-specific carbon resources. Dietary and isotopic niche revealed no clear change between total length, silvering stages and seasons, but a significant difference between salinity gradients and estuaries. Eels δ 13 C values showed significant enrichment from upper to lower along the estuaries while the δ 15 N values showed an inverse effect, with the lowest values in the lower part and highest in the upper part. Higher variability in δ 13 C values in larger estuaries suggested that eels feed on a wide range of food sources than in smaller estuaries. While eels in the smaller estuaries fed mainly on Actinopterygii prey, eels in the larger ones had a lower trophic level (i.e. δ 15 N values) and fed mainly on Malacostraca prey. This spatial difference in dietary and isotopic niche is discussed in relation to biological structure of eel and environmental variables."
https://openalex.org/W4283836139,"Conjugated bile acids (CBAs) play major roles in hepatic gene regulation via nuclear S1P-inhibited histone deacetylase (HDACs). Gut microbiota modifies bile acid pool to generate CBAs and then CBAs returned to liver to regulate hepatic genes, fatty liver, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, it is not yet known how the gut microbiota was modified under the environment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we revealed that aberrant intestinal sphingosine kinases (SphKs), a major risk factor of IBD, modified gut microbiota by increasing the proportions of Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia, which were associated with the increase in CBAs. When exposed to a high-fat diet (HFD), sphingosine kinases 2 knockout (SphK2KO) mice developed more severity of intestinal inflammation and hepatic steatosis than their wild-type (WT) littermates. Due to knockdown of nuclear SphK2, Sphk2KO mice exhibited an increase in sphingosine kinases 1 (SphK1) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in intestinal epithelial cells. Therefore, the microbiota was modified in the environment of the SphK1/S1P-induced IBD. 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing of cecal contents indicated an increase of Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) measured an increase in CBAs, including taurocholic acid (TCA), taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), and glycocholic acid (GCA), in cecal contents and liver tissues of Sphk2KO mice. These CBAs accumulated in the liver promoted hepatic steatosis through downregulating the acetylation of H3K9, H3K14, H3K18 and H3K27 due to the CBAs-S1PR2-nuclear SphK2-S1P signaling pathway was blocked in HFD-SphK2KO mice. In summary, intestinal aberrant sphingolipid metabolism developed hepatic steatosis through the increase in CBAs associated with an increase in Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia."
https://openalex.org/W4285740772,"The colloquial term ""hangry"" refers to the notion that people become angry when hungry, but very little research has directly determined the extent to which the relationship between hunger and negative emotions is robust. Here, we examined associations between everyday experiences of hunger and negative emotions using an experience sampling method. Sixty-four participants from Central Europe completed a 21-day experience sampling phase in which they reported their hunger, anger, irritability, pleasure, and arousal at five time-points each day (total = 9,142 responses). Results indicated that greater levels of self-reported hunger were associated with greater feelings of anger and irritability, and with lower pleasure. These findings remained significant after accounting for participant sex, age, body mass index, dietary behaviours, and trait anger. In contrast, associations with arousal were not significant. These results provide evidence that everyday levels of hunger are associated with negative emotionality and supports the notion of being ""hangry""."
https://openalex.org/W4283833126,"Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), as the interferon-stimulated gene, maximally drives type I interferon (IFN) production. However, the mechanisms by which the biological function of IRF7 is regulated remain elusive. In this study, we found that IRF7 selectively interacted with the neuralized E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 3 (NEURL3). In concomitant with IRF7 induction, NEURL3 is upregulated by NF-κB signaling in the late phase of viral infection. Moreover, NEURL3 augmented the host antiviral immune response through ubiquitinating IRF7. A mechanistic study revealed that NEURL3 triggered K63-linked poly-ubiquitination on IRF7 lysine 375, which in turn epigenetically enhanced the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through disruption of the association of IRF7 with Histone Deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), consequently augmenting host antiviral immune response. Accordingly, Neurl3-/- mice produced less type I IFNs and exhibited increased susceptibility to viral infection. Taken together, our findings identify NEURL3 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of IRF7 and shed new light on the positive regulation of IRF7 in host antiviral immune signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4284691226,"Viral-host protein protein interaction (PPI) analysis is essential to decode the molecular mechanism of viral pathogen and host immunity processes which eventually help to control viral diseases and optimize therapeutics. The state-of-the-art viral-host PPI predictor leverages unsupervised embedding learning technique (doc2vec) to generate statistical representations of viral-host protein sequences and a Random Forest classifier for interaction prediction. However, doc2vec approach generates the statistical representations of viral-host protein sequences by merely modelling the local context of residues which only partially captures residue semantics. The paper in hand proposes a novel technique for generating better statistical representations of viral and host protein sequences based on the infusion of comprehensive local and global contextual information of the residues. While local residue context aware encoding captures semantic relatedness and short range dependencies of residues. Global residue context aware encoding captures comprehensive long-range residues dependencies, positional invariance of residues, and unique residue combination distribution important for interaction prediction. Using concatenated rich statistical representations of viral and host protein sequences, a robust machine learning framework ""LGCA-VHPPI"" is developed which makes use of a deep forest model to effectively model complex non-linearity of viral-host PPI sequences. An in-depth performance comparison of the proposed LGCA-VHPPI framework with existing diverse sequence encoding schemes based viral-host PPI predictors reveals that LGCA-VHPPI outperforms state-of-the-art predictor by 6%, 2%, and 2% in terms of matthews correlation coefficient over 3 different benchmark viral-host PPI prediction datasets."
https://openalex.org/W4284691797,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex syndrome cluster of metabolic disorders, which greatly increases the risks of diabetic and cardiovascular diseases. Although it has become a significantly worldwide public health burden, its pathogenesis largely remains unknown. In this study, we first performed an integrated analysis of proteomic and metabonomic data of liver tissues of rats between MetS and control groups to reveal possible mechanisms of MetS. A total of 16 significantly perturbed pathways were identified, of which three pathways were shared by patients with MetS and diabetes identified by analysis of serum samples, including alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. Additionally, it was found that 18 differential metabolites were closely related with 36 differential proteins, which were considered as significantly discriminant metabolites and proteins between two groups and were mainly involved in metabolic processes of gamma-aminobutyric acid and acetyl-CoA, biosynthetic processes of cholesterol and amino acids. The results of PPI network analysis and topological parameter calculation of four methods revealed that 16 proteins can serve as hub proteins of MetS. Followed by searching the PubMed database and molecular docking of Cyp7a1 and Got1, we concluded that atorvastatin and resveratrol may be potential drugs for MetS."
https://openalex.org/W4283823095,"Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We hypothesize that a dysfunctional subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) may lead to an accumulation of ectopic fat in the liver. Our aim was to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the causative role of scWAT in NALFD progression. We performed a RNA-sequencing analysis in a discovery cohort (n = 45) to identify genes in scWAT correlated with fatty liver index, a qualitative marker of liver steatosis. We then validated those targets in a second cohort (n = 47) of obese patients who had liver biopsies available. Finally, we obtained scWAT mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from 13 obese patients at different stages of NAFLD and established in vitro models of human MSC (hMSC)-derived adipocytes. We observed impaired adipogenesis in hMSC-derived adipocytes as liver steatosis increased, suggesting that an impaired adipogenic capacity is a critical event in the development of NAFLD. Four genes showed a differential expression pattern in both scWAT and hMSC-derived adipocytes, where their expression paralleled steatosis degree: SOCS3, DUSP1, SIK1, and GADD45B. We propose these genes as key players in NAFLD progression. They could eventually constitute potential new targets for future therapies against liver steatosis."

Here, using mass spectrometry analysis (LC–MS/MS), followed by in vitro and in vivo experiments, we provided evidence that Foxn1 in keratinocytes regulates elements of the electron transport chain and participates in the thioredoxin system (Txn2, Txnrd3, and Srxn1) induction, particularly in a hypoxic environment. We first showed that Foxn1 in keratinocytes upregulates glutathione thioredoxin reductase 3 (Txnrd3) protein expression, and high levels of Txnrd3 mRNA were detected in injured skin of Foxn1+/+ mice. We also showed that Foxn1 strongly downregulated the Ccn2 protein expression, participating in epidermal reconstruction after injury. An in vitro assay revealed that Foxn1 controls keratinocyte migration, stimulating it under normoxia and suppressing it under hypoxia. Keratinocytes overexpressing Foxn1 and exposed to hypoxia displayed a reduced ability to promote angiogenesis by downregulating Vegfa expression. In conclusion, this study showed a new mechanism in which Foxn1, along with hypoxia, participates in the activation of antioxidant defense and controls the functional properties of keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W4284677035,"Sustainable Last-Mile Delivery (LMD) is one of the key phases in city logistics. Micro-hubs in cities are new emerging solutions for an easier and viable last-mile delivery process. The important question in smart and modern cities is the determination of the best micro-hub location for the LMD. This paper solves the micro-hub location selection for sustainable LMD using the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. The main reason for solving the micro-hub location selection is to make the last-mile delivery process in Pardubice as easier and effortless as possible. The Best-Worst Method (BWM), Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method, and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method are coupled to solve the micro-hub location selection for sustainable LMD. First, five criteria and alternatives are identified and discussed with the experts. Second, the hybrid criteria importance is determined by combining the BWM and CRITIC methods. Third, the obtained hybrid weights are integrated within the WASPAS method to rank the micro-hub locations. The findings of the Hybrid BWM-CRITIC-WASPAS model show the Alternative 2 (""Hůrka"") as the best possible location for Pardubice in the context of the LMD. In addition, a comparative analysis with some of the existing MCDM approaches is conducted for the same problem and its results show a high level of matching with the applied hybrid BWM-CRITIC-WASPAS method, which means that Alternative 2 (""Hůrka"") is strongly recommended as a micro-hub location for sustainable LMD in Pardubice."
https://openalex.org/W4284679584,"Brain low grade gliomas (LGG) often give serious clinical symptoms due to the invasion towards nervous system, affecting the life quality of patients. Collagen type I alpha 1(COL1A1) is the main component of type I collagen. Although there are many reports about abnormal expression of COL1A1 in various tumors, specific role and clinical significance of COL1A1 in LGG have not yet been elucidated. In this work, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database was used for detecting the expression level of COL1A1 in cancer and normal tissues, and aimed to explore the relationship between COL1A1 and tumor immune infiltration. We applied Kaplan-Meier to analyze the role of COL1A1 in clinical prognosis. Univariate survival rate and multivariate Cox analysis were used to compare clinical characteristics and survival rate. The relativity between the expression of COL1A1 and the tumor microenvironment was evaluated using ESTIMATE algorithm. Finally, the relationship between expression level of COL1A1 and gene marker sets of immune cell infiltration was investigated via TIMER. According to TCGA, COL1A1 overexpression was correlated with overall survival (OS), progression free interval (PFI) and disease specific survival (DSS) of multiple tumors, especially in LGG. Multivariate analysis showed that COL1A1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for LGG. The expression of COL1A1 was positively correlated with the infiltration of CD4 + T and CD8 + T cells, neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells in LGG. In addition, there was a strong correlation between expression of COL1A1 and different immune marker sets in LGG. The results suggest that COL1A1 is related with tumor immune infiltration of LGG."
https://openalex.org/W4284683156,"The goal of our study was to investigate the relative and absolute intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of ultrasound assessment of patellar tendon (PT) thickness assessed over four locations, in track cyclists and soccer players. Fifteen male elite track cyclists and 15 male elite soccer players participated. Tendon thickness was measured over 4 locations placed at 5-10-15-20 mm inferior to the apex of the patella by two experienced examiners. Each examiner took two US images for the test measurements with a 10-min rest period. After a 30-min period, the subjects underwent a retest measurements that were also repeated 1-week after. A two-way analysis of variance revealed a significant group x location interaction on PT thickness for Examiner 1 (p = .001, η 2 = .81) and Examiner 2 (p = 0.001, η 2 = 0.78). Intra-rater reliability ranged from good to excellent (ICC 2,k ≥ 0.75), whereas inter-rater reliability was good (ICC 2,k ≥ 0.75) in both groups. Ultrasonographic assessment of PT was found to be a reliable method to assess tendon thickness. The middle location of the PT (corresponding to 15 and 20 mm) can be considered the most reliable spot to measure PT thickness. The PT thickness was larger among track cyclists than soccer players, with larger differences over the distal location (15 mm). Ultrasonographic assessment of PT was found to be a reliable method to assess tendon thickness. The middle location of the PT corresponding to 15 mm and 20 mm can be considered the most reliable area to measure PT thickness."

A total of 36 participants initiated the treatment protocol and 32 (Gardening n = 15 and Art n = 17) received the interventions and completed all assessments. Treatments included eight one-hour group-based gardening or art intervention sessions. Self-report psychometric assessments were conducted for anxiety, depression symptomatology, mood disturbance, stress, satisfaction with discretionary social activities, and quality of life measures. Cardiac physiological data were also collected. Outcomes were measured at baseline, during, and post-intervention.Engaging in both gardening and art-making activities resulted in apparent therapeutic improvements for self-reported total mood disturbance, depression symptomatology, and perceived stress with different effect sizes following eight one-hour treatment sessions. Gardening also resulted in improvements for indications of trait anxiety. Based on time-course evidence, dosage responses were observed for total mood disturbance, perceived stress, and depression symptomatology for both gardening and art-making. However, gardening or art-making did not have an apparent influence on heart rate or blood pressure or result in marked improvement for satisfaction with discretionary leisure activities.The data did not support the hypothesis of differential therapeutic benefits of gardening and art-making for healthy women. When taken together, group-based gardening or art-making can provide quantitatively measurable improvements in healthy women's psychosocial health status that imply potentially important public health benefits.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03266120."

https://openalex.org/W4284675870,"People increasingly use various technologies that enable them to ease their everyday lives in different areas. Not only wearable devices are gaining ground, but also sensor-based ambient devices and systems are increasingly perceived as beneficial in supporting users. Especially older and/or frail persons can benefit from the so-called lifelogging technologies assisting the users in different activities and supporting their mobility and autonomy. This paper empirically investigates users' technology acceptance and privacy perceptions related to sensor-based applications implemented in private environments (i.e., passive infrared sensors for presence detection, humidity and temperature sensors for ambient monitoring, magnetic sensors for user-furniture interaction). For this purpose, we designed an online survey entitled ""Acceptance and privacy perceptions of sensor-based lifelogging technologies"" and collected data from N = 312 German adults. In terms of user acceptance, statistical analyses revealed that participants strongly agree on the benefits of such sensor-based ambient technologies, also perceiving these as useful and easy to use. Nevertheless, their intention to use the sensor-based applications was still rather limited. The evaluation of privacy perceptions showed that participants highly value their privacy and hence require a high degree of protection for their personal data. The potential users assessed the collection of data especially in the most intimate spaces of domestic environments, such as bathrooms and bedrooms, as critical. On the other hand, participants were also willing to provide complete data transparency in case of an acute risk to their health. Our results suggest that users' perceptions of personal privacy largely affect the acceptance and successful adoption of sensor-based lifelogging in home environments."

https://openalex.org/W4285742154,"Humans frequently interact with Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) at Punta Banda Estuary, Baja California, Mexico, due to the high incidence of recreational activities people undertake there. The immediate effect of these interactions is that seals flush to the water, reducing their time on land and, probably, increasing their energy expenditure. On-land observations were used to study the impact of different sources of disturbance on seal behavior and evaluate their effect on the amount of time dedicated to nursing over three pupping seasons, (2015-2017), with 0.58-0.81 disturbance events/hour recorded over the entire sampling period. Terrestrial vehicles were the source with the highest disturbance rate (number of disturbance events/h), followed closely by pedestrians. However, the proportion of seals affected was highest when pedestrians were the disturbance source. Recovery events (seals hauling out after flushing) occurred after 34% of disturbance events, after less than half of which the same number of hauled-out seals as there were prior to the disturbance were observed. Recovery time varied among the years studied, of which 2017 saw the longest recovery time. In addition, pedestrians were the disturbance source with the longest recovery time. Given that resting on land is essential for pup survival, which depends on both the establishment of the mother-pup bond from birth and its maintenance throughout nursing, flushing behavior may have significant implications for the entire colony during the nursing season. We recorded a decrease in nursing duration, which did not return to the same level even after recovery and the resumption of nursing. Terrestrial vehicles were found to be the disturbance source that shortened nursing events most significantly."

All were followed until hospital discharge or death. The combined outcome was hospital mortality or terminal extubation with hospice discharge. Twenty-five clinical and laboratory variables available 48 hours prior to intubation were entered into multiple logistic regression (MLR) and the resulting model was used to predict mortality of validation cohort patients. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) was calculated for C-TIME, APACHE IVa and SOFA.The median age of the 2,440 study patients was 66 years; 61.6 percent were men, and 50.5 percent were Hispanic, Native American or African American. Age, gender, COPD, minimum mean arterial pressure, Glasgow Coma scale score, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio, maximum creatinine and bilirubin, receiving factor Xa inhibitors, days receiving non-invasive respiratory support and days receiving corticosteroids prior to intubation were significantly associated with the outcome variable. The validation cohort comprised 1,179 patients. C-TIME had the highest AUROC of 0.75 (95%CI 0.72-0.79), vs 0.67 (0.64-0.71) and 0.59 (0.55-0.62) for APACHE and SOFA, respectively (Chi2 P<0.0001).C-TIME is the only mortality prediction score specifically developed and validated for COVID-19 patients who require mechanical ventilation. It has acceptable discriminant accuracy and goodness-of-fit to assist decision-making just prior to intubation.

https://openalex.org/W4285744739,"The main aim of the study, conducted in Poland, was to compare the academic achievement of 1552 (at Time 1) students without disabilities in three educational settings: general, without students with disabilities, inclusive (with co-teaching), with three to five students with disabilities, and inclusive (without co-teaching), with one to two students with disabilities. The study was longitudinal, with three waves eight months apart. The latent growth curve model was used for data analysis. The results have shown that changes in academic achievement (for language and for mathematics) over time were similar in all three groups; therefore, there were no differences between inclusive education (of the two types) and general education classrooms. These results mean that students neither lose nor benefit while learning in inclusive education classrooms. The findings are in line with the results of previous meta-analyses and are important for the future development of inclusive education."
https://openalex.org/W4283829609,"An intriguing outcome of hybridisation is the emergence of clonally and hemiclonally reproducing hybrids, that can sustain, reproduce, and lead to the emergence of polyploid forms. However, the maintenance of diploid and polyploid hybrid complexes in natural populations remains unresolved. We selected water frogs from the Pelophylax esculentus complex to study how diploid and triploid hybrids, which reproduce hemiclonally via hybridogenesis, are maintained in natural populations. During gametogenesis in diploid hybrids, one of the parental genomes is eliminated, and the remaining genome is endoreplicated. In triploid hybrids, the single-copy genome is typically eliminated, while genome endoreplication does not occur. To investigate how diploid and triploid hybrid frogs reproduce in populations without parental species, we crossed these hybrid animals from two separate pure hybrid populations located in Poland. Using cytogenetic analysis of tadpoles that emerged from the crosses, we established which gametes were produced by parental hybrids. The majority of hybrid females and hybrid males produced one type of gamete with the P . ridibundus genome. However, in both studied populations, approximately half of the diploid and triploid hybrids simultaneously produced gametes with different genome compositions and ploidy levels, specifically, the P . ridibundus and P . lessonae genomes, as well as diploid gametes with genomes of both parental species. Triploid hybrid males and females mostly produced haploid gametes with the P . lessonae genome; however, gametes with the P . ridibundus genome have also been observed. These results suggest that not all hybrids follow the classical hybridogenetic reproduction program and reveal a significant level of alterations in the gametogenesis pathways. In addition, we found a variable survival rate of particular progeny genotypes when we crossed hybrid females with different males suggesting the important role of postzygotic barriers on the maintenance of pure hybrid systems. We suggest that the observed variability in produced gametes and the different survival rate of the progeny with certain genotypes is crucial for the existence of pure hybrid systems."

https://openalex.org/W4284675797,"Informativeness (defined as reduction of uncertainty) is central in human communication. In the present study, we investigate baboons’ sensitivity to informativeness by manipulating the informativity of a cue relative to a response display and by allowing participants to anticipate their answers or to wait for a revealed answer (with variable delays). Our hypotheses were that anticipations would increase with informativity, while response times to revealed trials would decrease with informativity. These predictions were verified in Experiment 1. In Experiments 2 and 3, we manipulated rewards (rewarding anticipation responses at 70% only) to see whether reward tracking alone could account for the results in Experiment 1. We observed that the link between anticipations and informativeness disappeared, but not the link between informativeness and decreased RTs for revealed trials. Additionally, in all three experiments, the number of correct answers in revealed trials with fast reaction times (&lt; 250ms) increased with informativeness. We conclude that baboons are sensitive to informativeness as an ecologically sound means to tracking reward."
https://openalex.org/W4284678266,"A key component of behavior-based energy conservation programs is the identification of target behaviors. A common approach is to target behaviors with the greatest energy-saving potential. The concept of behavioral spillover introduces further considerations, namely that adoption of one energy-saving behavior may increase (or decrease) the likelihood of other energy-saving behaviors. This research aimed to identify and describe household energy- and water-saving measure classes within which positive spillover is likely to occur (e.g., adoption of energy-efficient appliances may correlate with adoption of water-efficient appliances), and explore demographic and psychographic predictors of each. Nearly 1,000 households in a California city were surveyed and asked to report whether they had adopted 75 different energy- and/or water-saving measures. Principal Component Analysis and Network Analysis based on correlations between adoption of these diverse measures revealed and characterized eight water-energy-saving measure classes: Water Conservation, Energy Conservation, Maintenance and Management, Efficient Appliance, Advanced Efficiency, Efficient Irrigation, Green Gardening, and Green Landscaping. Understanding these measure classes can help guide behavior-based energy program developers in selecting target behaviors and designing interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4284693547,"Determinants of elevational distribution of butterfly species richness and abundance in the tropics are poorly understood. Here we assess the combined effects, both additive and interactive, of seasonality and habitat structure on the elevational distribution of butterflies in the Uluguru Mountains, Tanzania. We sampled butterflies along a 1100 m elevational gradient that extended from 1540 to 2639 m using a time-constrained fixed-area method during the short to long rains and long to short rains transitions, and in habitat structure classified as closed or open. We used semi-parametric generalized linear mixed models to assess the relation between butterfly species richness or abundance, and seasonality, habitat structure, family and elevation. For all species combined, species richness declined with elevation in both open and closed habitats during the long to short rains transition. During the short to long rains transition, species richness displayed a mid-elevation peak across habitats. Among the three focal families (Nymphalidae, Papilionidae and Pieridae) similar patterns in the elevational distribution of species richness were observed. Species abundance declined or remained stable with elevation across seasons and habitat structure; the exception being species abundance in open habitat during the short to long rain transition and increased slightly with elevation. Abundance by family did not vary significantly by habitat structure or season. Our results indicate that seasonality and habitat structure shape species richness and abundance of butterflies along an elevational gradient in the Uluguru Mountains. These patterns are important for informing conservation actions because temperature as well as annual and seasonal variation in precipitation are predicted to increase in East Africa as a result of climate change, important determinants of seasonality, while habitat disturbance may increase due to a projected doubling in Tanzania’s population over the next 27 years."

We used confirmatory factor analysis and the Rasch rating scale model for analyzing the data extracted from the proxy versions of the 2019 and 2020 National Health and Aging Trends Study, USA. A total of 403 participants were included in the analysis. The confirmatory factor analysis with a 1-factor model using the robust weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimator indicated a unidimensional measurement structure ( χ 2 = 41.015, df = 20, p = 0.004; root mean square error of approximation = 0.051; comparative fit index = 0.995; Tucker–Lewis Index = 0.993;). The findings indicated that the AD-8 has no misfitting items and no differential item functioning across sex and gender. The items were evenly distributed in the item difficulty rating (range: −2.30 to 0.98 logits). While there were floor effects, the AD-8 revealed good reliability (Rasch person reliability = 0.67, Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89). The Rasch analysis reveals that the AD-8 has excellent psychometric properties that can be used as a screening assessment tool in clinical settings allowing clinicians to measure dementia both quickly and efficiently. To summarize, the AD-8 could be a useful primary screening tool to be used with additional diagnostic testing, if the patient is accompanied by a reliable informant."
https://openalex.org/W4285032008,"Influenza A virus infection is a contagious acute respiratory infection which mostly evolves in an epidemic form, less frequently as pandemic outbreaks. It can take a severe clinical form that needs to be managed in intensive care unit (ICU). The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical aspects of influenza A, then to determine independent predictive factors of ICU mortality in Abderrahmen Mami hospital, Ariana, Tunisia.It was a single-center study, including all hospitalized patients in intensive care, between November 1st, 2009 and October 31st, 2019, with influenza A virus infection. We recorded demographic, clinical and biological data, evolving features; then multivariate analysis of the predictive factors of ICU mortality was realized.During the study period (10 consecutive seasons), 120 patients having severe Influenza A were admitted (Proportion = 2.5%) from all hospitalized patients, with a median age of 48 years and a gender-ratio of 1.14. Among women, 14 were pregnant. Only 7 patients (5.8%) have had seasonal flu vaccine during the year before ICU admission. The median values of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment were respectively 26, 10 and 3. Virus strains identified with polymerase chain reaction were H1N1 pdm09 (84.2%) and H3N2 (15.8%). Antiviral therapy was prescribed in 88 (73.3%) patients. A co-infection was recorded in 19 cases: bacterial (n = 17) and aspergillaire (n = 2). An acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed in 82 patients. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was conducted for 72 (60%) patients with success in 34 cases. Endotracheal intubation was performed in 59 patients with median duration of invasive mechanical ventilation 8 [3.25-13] days. The most frequent complications were acute kidney injury (n = 50, 41.7%), shock (n = 48, 40%), hospital-acquired infections (n = 46, 38.8%) and thromboembolic events (n = 19, 15.8%). The overall ICU mortality rate was of 31.7% (deceased n = 38). Independent predictive factors of ICU mortality identified were: age above 56 years (OR = 7.417; IC95% [1.474-37.317]; p = 0.015), PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 95 mmHg (OR = 9.078; IC95% [1.636-50.363]; p = 0.012) and lymphocytes count ≤ 1.325 109/L (OR = 10.199; IC95% [1.550-67.101]; p = 0.016).Influenza A in ICU is not uncommon, even in A(H1N1) dominant seasons; its management is highly demanding. It is responsible for considerable morbi-mortality especially in elderly patients."

In this work, 2520 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Cobb) were randomly assigned to 84 pens, containing 30 birds each. The experimental design was completely randomized, with seven treatments: enramycin (8 ppm), virginiamycin (16.5 ppm), and tylosin (55 ppm); different doses of CNSL-castor oil (0.5, 0.75, and 1.00 kg/t); and a control diet (without additives). All treatments received semduramicin + nicarbazin (500 g/t; Aviax® Plus) from 0 to 28 d and monensin sodium (100 ppm; Elanco) from 29 to 35 days of age, when the feed was without antibiotics. The challenge was introduced at 14 days of age by inoculating broiler chickens with sporulated Eimeria tenella, Eimeria acervulina, and Eimeria maxima oocysts via oral gavage. In addition to performance parameters, intestinal contents were collected at 28 and 42 days of age for microbiota analysis by sequencing the 16s rRNA in V3 and V4 regions using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Taxonomy was assigned using the SILVA database (v. 138) with QIIME2 software (v. 2020.11). After one week of challenge, the broilers that received tylosin had a higher body weight gain (BWG) than those in the control group (p < 0.05), while the other treatments presented intermediate values. At 28 d, the BWG was lower for the control, CNSL-Castor oil 0.5 kg/t, enramycin, and virginiamycin treatments than that in the tylosin treatment. The inclusion of CNSL-Castor oil at concentrations of 0.75 and 1 kg/t acted as an intermediate treatment (p < 0.05). For alpha diversity, using the Shannon index, it was possible to observe the effect of age, with substantial diversity at 42 d. The Firmicutes phylum had the highest abundance, with values between 84.33% and 95.16% at 42 d. Tylosin showed better performance indices than other treatments. CNSL-castor oil treatments with concentrations of 0.75 and 1 kg/t showed similar results to those of enramycin and virginiamycin. Furthermore, CNSL-castor oil acted as a modulator of intestinal microbiota, reducing the abundance of pathogenic bacteria."

Yet the conditions under which we communication social information remain unclear. Testing hypotheses generated from our theoretical framework, we examined when and why social information is disseminated about an absent third party: i.e., gossiped. Gossip scenarios presented to participants (e.g., ""Person-X cheated on their exam"") were based on three key factors: (1) target (ingroup, outgroup, or celebrity), (2) valence (positive or negative), and (3) content. We then asked them (a) whether they would spread the information, and (b) to rate it according to subjective valence, ordinariness, interest level, and emotion. For ratings, the scenarios participants chose to gossip were considered to have higher valence (whether positive or negative), to be rarer, more interesting, and more emotionally evocative; thus showing that the paradigm was meaningful to subjects. Indeed, for target, valence, and content, a repeated-measures ANOVA found significant effects for each factor independently, as well as their interactions. The results supported our hypotheses: e.g., for target, more gossiping about celebrities and ingroup members (over strangers); for valence, more about negative events overall, and yet for ingroup members, more positive gossiping; for content, more about moral topics, with yet all domains of social content communicated depending on the situation-context matters, influencing needs. The findings suggest that social knowledge sharing (i.e., gossip) involves sophisticated calculations that require our highest sociocognitive abilities, and provide specific hypotheses for future examination of neural mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4285744169,"Background Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) is a heterogeneous disease, which assessment and severity can’t be defined by one particular instrument but using a multidimensional score. Thus, in additional to traditional methods, alternative tools have been developed to assist these patients’ evaluation. Objective To correlate functional and morphological indexes with severity and dyspnea in NCFB patients, focusing on the correlation between the impulse oscillometry system (IOS) and the quantitative analysis of computed tomography (CT). Methods Clinically stable NCFB patients, between 18 and 80 years old were submitted to clinical, functional and morphological evaluations assessed by Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) and Medical Research Council (MRC) scale; spirometry and IOS; and subjective and quantitative Chest CT scans analysis, respectively. Results This study included 38 patients. The best correlations obtained between functional and morphological airway indexes were: resistance at 5 Hz—R5 and the normalized thickness of bronchial walls—Pi10 (r = 0.57), and the mean forced expiratory flow (FEF 25-75% ) and CT score (r = -0.39). BSI as well as MRC showed higher correlations with the quantitative automated analysis of CT (BSI and Pi10: r = 0.41; MRC and Pi10: r = 0.35) than with subjective CT score (BSI and CT score: r = 0.41; MRC and CT score: r = 0.15); and moderate and weak correlations were obtained on both functional airway indexes (BSI and peripheral airways resistance - R5-R20: r = 0.53; BSI and forced expiratory volume at the first second—FEV 1 : R = -0,64; MRC and R5-R20: r = 0.42; and MRC and VEF 1 : r = -0.45). Conclusion In NCFB patients, compartmentalized methods for assessing the respiratory system (IOS and the automated quantitative CT analysis) have a good correlation with severity and dyspnea."
https://openalex.org/W4285744831,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant threat in healthcare settings where it deploys a wide host of virulence factors to cause disease. Many virulence-related phenotypes such as pyocyanin production, biofilm formation, and twitching motility have been implicated in causing disease in a number of hosts. In this study, we investigate these three virulence factors in a collection of 22 clinical strains isolated from blood stream infections. Despite the fact that all 22 strains caused disease and came from the same body site of different patients, they show significant variability in assays for each of the three specific phenotypes examined. There was no significant correlation between the strength of the three phenotypes across our collection, suggesting that they can be independently modulated. Furthermore, strains deficient in each of the virulence-associated phenotypes examined could be identified. To understand the genetic basis of this variability we sequenced the genomes of the 22 strains. We found that the majority of genes responsible for pyocyanin production, biofilm formation, and twitching motility were highly conserved among the strains despite their phenotypic variability, suggesting that the phenotypic variability is likely due to regulatory changes. Our findings thus demonstrate that no one lab-assayed phenotype of pyocyanin production, biofilm production, and twitching motility is necessary for a P . aeruginosa strain to cause blood stream infection and that additional factors may be needed to fully predict what strains will lead to specific human diseases."

We used the National Health Insurance Service–National Health Screening Cohort (NHIS–HEALS) database of National Health Information Database. The NHIS–HEALS dataset includes disability information of National Screening Programme participants, including registration date and type of disability, which is merged from Korean National Disability Registry (KNDR). We used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the association between TUG and disability incidence. We constructed three models with different levels of adjustment; Model 3 was a fully adjusted model. We conducted subgroup analysis according to the risk factors for disability. The study population comprised 81,473 participants; 86 of them were newly registered to KNDR, which were observed during a mean follow-up of 4.1 ± 2.6 (maximum, 8.9) years. For 334,200.9 person-year (PY) follow-up, the disability incidence rate was 0.208 per 1,000 PY. Disability incidence was significantly higher in participants with abnormal TUG results than in those with normal TUG results. (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.600, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.036–2.472). In subgroup analysis, the disability incidence increased in participants of normal cognition, without obesity or without cardiovascular (CV) disease.

The present research evaluated the germination, rooting and physiological characteristics of seedlings of Paeonia ostii 'Fengdan' in response to different physical treatments and the application of exogenous chemicals. Results indicated that seeds stored in sand at room temperature, and soaked in water for 3 days prior to planting, had a beneficial effect on hypocotyl dormancy-breaking. The rate of rooting and root growth of Paeonia ostii 'Fengdan' were significantly improved with 5 cm sowing depth in 15-20℃ soils. Compared with other sowing depths, the rooting percentage was significantly increased by 1.19% (2.5 cm), 0.98% (7.5 cm) and 1.47% (10 cm), respectively. Epicotyl dormancy was relieved when taproot length reached 50 mm. Soaking seeds in 0.76 mmol/L 5-aminolevulinic acid for 48 hours had the greatest beneficial effect on seed germination and seedling growth, the germination percentage was significantly increased by 4.25% (24 h) and 5.08% (72 h) compared with other treatments. While seed soaked in 10 mmol/L sodium nitroprusside for 48 hours also exhibited enhanced seedling growth, and the germination percentage was significantly increased by 4.36% (24 h) and 7.40% (72 h). Those results benefited seed germination and seedling growth of Paeonia ostii 'Fengdan' which could suggest the promotion of its industrial values and productive potentials.

The first arrays have only recently been deployed and there is no consensus yet on the optimal array design. In this paper, we explore whether the maximum harvestable power can be increased by using harvesters or flow deflectors that exert a side force in the streamnormal direction to oppose the expansion of the streamtube. The power harvesting and the side force exertion are modelled with sink terms in the two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. We found that the power limit increases linearly with the side force, and it should be exerted from the upstream side edges of the array. We conclude that future arrays might not be made only of turbines that harvest power, but also of deflectors such as vertical wings of size comparable to a turbine. The promising results of this theoretical study may direct new research on the use of deflectors to maximise the power harvested by tidal arrays."

This study aimed to assess the association between intrathoracic calcification and IGRA results. Methods We retrospectively included consecutive patients who concurrently underwent chest X-ray, chest computed tomography (CT), and an IGRA. Patients with a current diagnosis of active TB or treatment history of active TB or latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) were excluded. The association between calcification according to the chest X-ray or CT and IGRA results were analyzed using binomial logistic regression. Results This study included 574 patients, and 38 (7%) patients had a positive IGRA result. Patients with a positive result were significantly older and had a higher proportion of comorbidities, and history of tuberculosis exposure compared to those with a negative result. Calcification of the lung field and mediastinal lymph nodes according to chest CT was more frequently observed in patients with a positive IGRA result, whereas no significant difference was observed concerning the proportion of lung field calcification on chest X-ray between patients with positive and negative IGRA results. In multivariate analysis, calcification of mediastinal lymph nodes alone (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.76–8.26) and the combination of lung field and mediastinal lymph node calcification (adjusted OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 1.51–11.76) on chest CT was independently associated with positive IGRA results. Conclusions The finding of mediastinal lymph node calcification, with or without lung field calcification, on chest CT was associated with positive IGRA results independent of TB exposure history. Previous TB infection including eliminated TB infection and LTBI can be suspected when calcified lymph nodes in are observed the mediastinum on chest CT."

On the other hand, the parental effect that feeding on these enriched transgenic crops may have on the offspring of the phytophagous that survive on them is not well known. In this work, the effect of vitamin A (β-carotene) addition to diets with or without Bt toxin on Helicoverpa armigera larvae and their offspring was determined. The addition of vitamin A did not have any beneficial effect either for the larvae fed on enriched diets nor for their offspring. However, parental effects due to dietary feeding with the toxin were detected since adults from larvae fed on the Bt diet had higher mating success than those fed on the toxin-free diet, although there were no differences on the fertility of mated females regardless of whether their previous larvae fed on the Bt or non-Bt diet. A certain adaptive effect to the toxin was also noted since the mortality of larvae whose previous generation fed on diet with Bt was lower than that of the larvae that came from larvae fed on a non-Bt diet. It would be interesting to determine if H. armigera adults prefer to mate and lay eggs in the same type of crops in which they have developed or if feeding on different crops, such as corn or alfalfa, causes different paternal effects on the offspring. These aspects can be of great importance in the development of resistance of this species to the Bt toxin."

We estimated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody prevalence (seroprevalence) among blood donors in metropolitan Melbourne following a COVID-19 outbreak in the city between June and September 2020. The aim was to determine the extent of infection spread and whether seroprevalence varied demographically in proportion to reported cases of infection. The design involved stratified sampling of residual specimens from blood donors (aged 20-69 years) in three postcode groups defined by low (<3 cases/1,000 population), medium (3-7 cases/1,000 population) and high (>7 cases/1,000 population) COVID-19 incidence based on case notification data. All specimens were tested using the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay. Seroprevalence was estimated with adjustment for test sensitivity and specificity for the Melbourne metropolitan blood donor and residential populations, using multilevel regression and poststratification. Overall, 4,799 specimens were collected between 23 November and 17 December 2020. Seroprevalence for blood donors was 0.87% (90% credible interval: 0.25-1.49%). The highest estimates, of 1.13% (0.25-2.15%) and 1.11% (0.28-1.95%), respectively, were observed among donors living in the lowest socioeconomic areas (Quintiles 1 and 2) and lowest at 0.69% (0.14-1.39%) among donors living in the highest socioeconomic areas (Quintile 5). When extrapolated to the Melbourne residential population, overall seroprevalence was 0.90% (0.26-1.51%), with estimates by demography groups similar to those for the blood donors. The results suggest a lack of extensive community transmission and good COVID-19 case ascertainment based on routine testing during Victoria's second epidemic wave. Residual blood donor samples provide a practical epidemiological tool for estimating seroprevalence and information on population patterns of infection, against which the effectiveness of ongoing responses to the pandemic can be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W4285742892,"Gender differences in career success are still an issue in society and research, and men typically earn higher incomes than women do. Building on previous theorizing and findings with the Theory of Gendered Organizations and the Theory of Tokenism, we used a large sample of the adult starting cohort in the German National Educational Panel Study and a multilevel approach to test how the interaction between gender and the gender ratio in occupations was associated with income. We wanted to know whether the male advantage in terms of income would be equal in magnitude across occupations (as suggested by the Theory of Gendered Organizations) or if it would vary with the gender ratio in occupations (as suggested by the Theory of Tokenism and reasoning regarding person-job fit), such that people benefit either (a) from resembling the majority of employees in a field by working in a gender-typical occupation or (b) from standing out by working in a gender-atypical occupation. Analyses supported the hypothesis that employees’ incomes may benefit if they belong to the gender minority in an occupation, but this finding applied only to women. By contrast, men did not benefit from working in a gender-atypical occupation. Thus, women earned less than men earned overall, but the gender pay gap was smaller in occupations with a higher ratio of male employees. The findings can advance the understanding of gender-related career decisions for both employers and employees."

The objectives of this study were to determine the metrics deemed important by runners for monitoring running-related injury (RRI) risk, and identify the facilitators and barriers to their use of injury focused wearable technologies.A qualitative focus group study was undertaken. Nine semi-structured focus groups with male (n = 13) and female (n = 14) recreational runners took place. Focus groups were audio and video recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were thematically analysed. A critical friend approach was taken to data coding, and multiple methods of trustworthiness were executed.Excessive loading and inadequate recovery were deemed the most important risk factors to monitor for RRI risk. Other important factors included training activities, injury status and history, and running technique. The location and method of attachment of a wearable device, the design of a smartphone application, and receiving useful injury-related information will affect recreational runners' adoption of injury focused technologies.Overtraining, training-related and individual-related risk factors are essential metrics that need to be monitored for RRI risk. RRI apps should include the metrics deemed important by runners, once there is supporting evidence-based research. The difficulty and/or ease of use of a device, and receiving useful feedback will influence the adoption of injury focused running technologies. There is a clear willingness from recreational runners to adopt injury focused wearable technologies whilst running."
https://openalex.org/W4285743088,"The novel coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly harmed numerous social and economic activities worldwide, drawing researchers and governments’ attention to the problem and tackling it via persistent healthcare measures. The study’s primary purpose is to examine the effects of total coronavirus cases, total fatalities, total recovered cases, unemployment, and trade openness on stock prices and economic growth in the world’s top 39 affected nations. An analysis of the coronavirus outbreaks found that wealthier countries had a well-established healthcare infrastructure, but they were disproportionately affected by the virus. Conversely, the less wealthy nations had inadequate healthcare infrastructures, but they were not as affected as the wealthier countries. Is it possible to buy health with money? That was the question at the heart of the study’s money-and-health curve. The robust least square regression results indicate that an increase in coronavirus cases influences economic growth and stock market performance due to massive healthcare funding distributed globally, sustaining economic and financial activities for a shorter period. However, a continuous increase in coronavirus fatalities depresses the stock market, resulting in financial depression worldwide. Additionally, a rise in overall coronavirus recovered cases has a negative effect on the country’s economic development and stock market performance because of greater uncertainty in economic and financial activities. Case fatality ratios influence economic growth, whereas case recovery ratios decrease economic and financial performance due to greater healthcare concerns across countries. Finally, trade openness is critical in sustaining the country’s economic development and stock market performance in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic."
