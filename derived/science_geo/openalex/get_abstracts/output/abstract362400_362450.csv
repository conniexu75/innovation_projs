https://openalex.org/W2113340624,"Glucocorticoids, end products of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, influence functions of virtually all organs and tissues through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Circulating levels of glucocorticoids fluctuate naturally in a circadian fashion and regulate the transcriptional activity of GR in target tissues. The basic helix-loop-helix protein CLOCK, a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), and its heterodimer partner BMAL1 are self-oscillating transcription factors that generate circadian rhythms in both the central nervous system and periphery. We found that CLOCK/BMAL1 repressed GR-induced transcriptional activity in a HAT-activity- dependent fashion. In serum-shock-synchronized cells, transactivational activity of GR, accessed by mRNA expression of an endogenous-responsive gene, fluctuated spontaneously in a circadian fashion in reverse phase with CLOCK/BMAL1 mRNA expression. CLOCK and GR interacted with each other physically, and CLOCK suppressed binding of GR to its DNA recognition sequences by acetylating multiple lysine residues located in its hinge region. These findings indicate that CLOCK/BMAL1 functions as a reverse-phase negative regulator of glucocorticoid action in target tissues, possibly by antagonizing biological actions of diurnally fluctuating circulating glucocorticoids. Further, these results suggest that a peripheral target tissue circadian rhythm indirectly influences the functions of every organ and tissue inside the body through modulation of the ubiquitous and diverse actions of glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W2104927620,"The movement of most transmembrane proteins between the various membranes of the cell is directed by short linear amino acid sequences in their cytoplasmic portions. These sequence motifs are bound by protein components of transport vesicle coats thereby incorporating the transmembrane proteins as vesicle cargo. In the case of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) the motifs are recognised by the AP complexes or GGA clathrin adaptors. The clathrin adaptor AP2 recognizes two major classes of endocytic motifs including an acidic dileucine motif. In this study, Kelly et al. present the crystal structure of AP2 in a complex with the dileucine motif of a cargo protein thereby revealing the mechanism of cargo-adaptor recognition. During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, cargo proteins are recognized by clathrin adaptors. The clathrin adaptor AP2 recognizes two major classes of endocytic motifs, including an acidic dileucine motif. This study presents the crystal structure of AP2 in complex with the diceucine motif of a cargo protein, thereby revealing the mechanism of cargo–adaptor recognition. Most transmembrane proteins are selected as transport-vesicle cargo through the recognition of short, linear amino-acid motifs in their cytoplasmic portions by vesicle coat proteins. For clathrin-coated vesicles, the motifs are recognized by clathrin adaptors. The AP2 adaptor complex (subunits α, β2, μ2 and σ2) recognizes both major endocytic motifs: YxxΦ motifs1 (where Φ can be F, I, L, M or V) and [ED]xxxL[LI] acidic dileucine motifs. Here we describe the binding of AP2 to the endocytic dileucine motif from CD4 (ref. 2). The major recognition events are the two leucine residues binding in hydrophobic pockets on σ2. The hydrophilic residue four residues upstream from the first leucine sits on a positively charged patch made from residues on the σ2 and α subunits. Mutations in key residues inhibit the binding of AP2 to ‘acidic dileucine’ motifs displayed in liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, but do not affect binding to YxxΦ motifs through μ2. In the ‘inactive’ AP2 core structure3 both motif-binding sites are blocked by different parts of the β2 subunit. To allow a dileucine motif to bind, the β2 amino terminus is displaced and becomes disordered; however, in this structure the YxxΦ-binding site on μ2 remains blocked."
https://openalex.org/W2007598683,"Protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates a set of intracellular signaling pathways, collectively termed the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). UPR signaling promotes cell survival by reducing misfolded protein levels. If homeostasis cannot be restored, UPR signaling promotes cell death. The molecular basis for the switch between prosurvival and proapoptotic UPR function is poorly understood. The ER-resident proteins, PERK and IRE1, control two key UPR signaling pathways. Protein misfolding concomitantly activates PERK and IRE1 and has clouded insight into their contributions toward life or death cell fates. Here, we employed chemical-genetic strategies to activate individually PERK or IRE1 uncoupled from protein misfolding. We found that sustained PERK signaling impaired cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. By contrast, equivalent durations of IRE1 signaling enhanced cell proliferation without promoting cell death. These results demonstrate that extended PERK and IRE1 signaling have opposite effects on cell viability. Differential activation of PERK and IRE1 may determine life or death decisions after ER protein misfolding."
https://openalex.org/W2012477673,"Much interest in vertebrate embryology is now focused on early pattern formation in the frog, Xenopus laevis. In this species, the body plan is specified by a stable positional system set up by a cytoplasmic rotation in the zygote that occurs before first cleavage. Perturbation of this initial cellular event by a variety of means causes permanent distortions of the positional system. Until now it has not been possible to alter the positional system after it has been specified. However, we report here that lithium, when applied after specification of the body plan, can respecify the positional system of the Xenopus embryo such that dorsal, axial structures develop from cells that otherwise contribute to ventral structures. Lithium is usually considered to have negative effects on early embryo development, but our results show that lithium can act in a positive manner to produce structures which represent the uppermost values of the positional system. This discovery introduces a convenient means to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of early vertebrate pattern expression."

To address the role of LPA in regulating platelet function and thrombosis, we investigated the effects of LPA on isolated murine platelets. Although LPA activates platelets from the majority of human donors, we found that treatment of isolated murine platelets with physiologic concentrations of LPA attenuated agonist-induced aggregation. Transgenic overexpression of autotaxin/lysophospholipase D (Enpp2), the enzyme necessary for production of the bulk of biologically active LPA in plasma, elevated circulating LPA levels and induced a bleeding diathesis and attenuation of thrombosis in mice. Intravascular administration of exogenous LPA recapitulated the prolonged bleeding time observed in Enpp2-Tg mice. Enpp2+/- mice, which have ∼50% normal plasma LPA levels, were more prone to thrombosis. Plasma autotaxin associated with platelets during aggregation and concentrated in arterial thrombus, and activated but not resting platelets bound recombinant autotaxin/lysoPLD in an integrin-dependent manner. These results identify a novel pathway in which LPA production by autotaxin/lysoPLD regulates murine hemostasis and thrombosis and suggest that binding of autotaxin/lysoPLD to activated platelets may provide a mechanism to localize LPA production.

LPA is also a weak activator of human platelet aggregation and potentiates the effects of other agonists such as ADP and epinephrine (3Gerrard J.M. Kindom S.E. Peterson D.A. Peller J. Krantz K.E.

LPA triggers several signaling pathways in human platelets that could account for its stimulatory effects (4Retzer M. Siess W. Essler M.

To date, five bona fide cell surface LPA G-protein-coupled receptors, termed LPA 1-5, have been identified, and three more have recently been proposed (13Chun J. Goetzl E.J. Hla T. Igarashi Y.

Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). LPA is present in human plasma at ∼ 0.1 μm. LPA concentrations are ∼ 10-fold higher in serum and have been reported to be elevated in plasma in the setting of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (15Chen X. Yang X.Y. Wang N.D. Ding C. Yang Y.J. You Z.J. Su Q. Chen J.H. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 2003; 63: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Platelets contribute to LPA production (16Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), perhaps by the release of LPA precursors during platelet activation, and platelet depletion or treatment with anti-platelet agents lowers circulating LPA levels in rodents (17Aoki J. Taira A. Takanezawa Y. Kishi Y. Hama K. Kishimoto T. Mizuno K. Saku K. Taguchi R. Arai H. J. Biol.

LPA is also abundant in human atherosclerotic plaques, where it is thought to be derived, in part, from mild oxidation of low density lipoproteins (19Siess W. Zangl K.J. Essler M. Bauer M. Brandl R. Corrinth C. Bittman R. Tigyi G. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6931-6936Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Indeed, LPA has been proposed to be a primary lipid in atherosclerotic plaque that is responsible for platelet activation (20Rother E. Brandl R. Baker D.L. Goyal P. Gebhard H. Tigyi G. Siess W. Circulation. 2003; 108: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Hence, anti-thrombotic therapy targeting LPA production or receptor-mediated signaling may be a novel strategy to prevent thrombus formation in the setting of atherosclerosis. The major mechanism for the generation of receptor-active LPA in blood involves hydrolysis of lysophospholipids by the secreted plasma protein autotaxin/lysophospholipase D (lyso-PLD) (21Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). This single polypeptide enzyme is a member of a family of nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase enzymes (ENPPs), which are cell surface ecto- or are in some cases either secreted or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored enzymes that exhibit a broad ability to catalyze non-selective hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds of a range of nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives (22Stefan C. Jansen S. Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 542-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In this nomenclature, autotaxin/lysoPLD is termed ENPP2, which is one of six ENPP family members. Among these enzymes, autotaxin/lysoPLD is unique because in vitro it exhibits a broad specificity lysophospholipase D activity that can generate LPA by hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (23Cimpean A. Stefan C. Gijsbers R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Autotaxin/lysoPLD can also hydrolyze sphingosylphosphorylcholine to generate sphingosine 1-phosphate; however, this reaction may not contribute significantly to circulating sphingosine 1-phosphate levels (23Cimpean A. Stefan C. Gijsbers R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because levels of LPC in plasma vastly exceed those of sphingosylphosphorylcholine, LPC is likely to be the physiologically important substrate for the enzyme. Studies using genetically altered mice identify a role for autotaxin/lysoPLD in the regulation of LPA levels in the blood. Mice with one copy of the gene encoding autotaxin/lysoPLD (Enpp2+/-) exhibit no obvious developmental phenotype but have reduced plasma levels of LPA (but not sphingosphine-1-phosphate) that are ∼50% that of wild-type mice (24van Meeteren L.A. Ruurs P. Stortelers C. Bouwman P. van Rooijen M.A. Pradere J.P. Pettit T.R. Wakelam M.J. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Mummery C.L. Moolenaar W.H. Jonkers J. Mol. Cell.

This important finding implicates autotaxin/lysoPLD as a key component of a physiologically relevant pathway for production of LPA in the blood and also suggests that, because levels of the LPC substrate are well above the measured Km of the enzyme, modulation of plasma levels of autotaxin/lysoPLD may be an important mechanism for regulating circulating levels of LPA. Autotaxin/lysoPLD deficiency in mice (Enpp2-/-) results in embryonic lethality because of vascular defects, implicating autotaxin/lysoPLD and potentially LPA in vascular development (24van Meeteren L.A. Ruurs P. Stortelers C. Bouwman P. van Rooijen M.A. Pradere J.P. Pettit T.R. Wakelam M.J. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Mummery C.L. Moolenaar W.H. Jonkers J. Mol. Cell.

Genetic manipulation of enzymes and receptors involved in LPA synthesis, inactivation, and signaling promises to provide mouse models to be used in defining the role of LPA in cardiovascular function and pathophysiology. Here we investigated the effects of LPA on murine platelet function and sought to determine the consequences of manipulating plasma LPA levels on thrombosis and hemostasis in mice. Enpp2-Tg and Enpp2+/- Mice-All procedures conformed to the recommendations of the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (Department of Health, Education, and Welfare publication no. NIH 78-23, 1996) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were weaned at 21 days, maintained on a 14-h light and 10-h dark cycle, and fed water and standard rodent chow (2018 Harlan Tekland Rodent Diet) ad libitum. Enpp2+/- mice were generated as previously described (24van Meeteren L.A. Ruurs P. Stortelers C. Bouwman P. van Rooijen M.A. Pradere J.P. Pettit T.R. Wakelam M.J. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Mummery C.L.

To generate mice that overexpress circulating autotaxin/lysoPLD, the human α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) promoter was used to drive expression of the enzyme in liver, which we hoped would result in secretion of the recombinant enzyme into the blood. Preliminary experiments indicated that mouse liver expresses low levels of LPA receptors, 4F. Fang and G. B. Mills, unpublished data. which would minimize the local effects of autotaxin/lysoPLD-mediated LPA generation on liver tissue. The A1AT promoter (-1206-+44) was amplified by PCR from a Yac clone obtained from ATCC. The promoter sequences were cloned in sense orientation into the NheI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3/zeo-Ennp2 (gift of Dr. J. Aoki). Thus, the 5′ end of the human Ennp2 cDNA was linked to the A1AT promoter, and its 3′ end was linked to the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal within pcDNA3/zeo. The entire fragment was excised from the vector and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. This DNA was purified using a Qiagen EX kit, diluted with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and used for microinjection. The DNA at a concentration of 2 μg/ml was injected into 100 individual pronuclei of one-cell-stage FVB mouse embryos in the MD Anderson Transgenic Core Facilities. Injected cells were transferred into the oviduct of pseudopregnant female mice, who were allowed to develop to term. Pups were screened for the transgene by using genomic PCR and Southern blotting. For routine genotyping, genomic DNA was isolated from tail biopsies and used as template for PCR. A forward primer (5′-GATCCCAGCCAGTGGACTTA-3′) specific to the promoter as well as a reverse primer (5′-TCTGACACGACTGGAACGAG-3) specific for hEnnp2 were used. Thirty PCR cycles (94 °C × 1 min, 58 °C × 1 min, 72 °C × 1 min) yielded the expected 264-bp product. Blood Collection, Blood Counts, and Bleeding Time Assay-Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and blood was collected by puncture of the retrobulbar venous plexus into EDTA-coated tubes or into a tube containing 0.1 volume of sodium citrate. EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood was analyzed in an ABC Vet analyzer set to measure mouse blood cells. For prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time assays, blood was collected into 1/10 volume of 3.2% citrate. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation and warmed at 37 °C for 60 s. For prothrombin time, 100 μl of plasma was mixed with 200 μl of thromboplastin (Dade Behring), and clotting time was determined; for activated partial thromboplastin time, 50 μl of Alexin reagent (Trinity Biotech) was added to 50-μl plasma samples and incubated for 180 s at which time 50 μl of 0.02 m CaCl2 was added, and clotting time was determined (26Emeis J.J.

Tsakiris D.A. Scudder L.E. Coller B.S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Citrated whole mouse blood (500 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of a solution of citrated saline buffer (0.38% citrate, 150 mm NaCl) and centrifuged (300 × g × 3 min) at room temperature to obtain a platelet- and plasma-rich buffer fraction. After the fraction containing platelets and plasma was removed, 200 μl of CGS (120 mM NaCl, 13 mM trisodium citrate, 30 mM dextrose) buffer was added to the remaining red cell pellet, and the suspension was mixed. Platelet-rich buffer was again obtained by centrifugation (300 × g × 4 min), and the two platelet-rich fractions were combined. Platelets were isolated by centrifugation (1800 × g × 10 min) then washed 2 times with CGS buffer before final resuspension in Tyrode buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm NaH2P04, 12 mm NaHC03, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.35) at 1-3 × 108/ml.

On the day of use, LPA was air-dried in a glass tube and bath-sonicated in buffer containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 5 min. For flow cytometry, citrate anti-coagulated whole blood was incubated with fluorescent antibody for 30 min at room temperature before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Anti-fibrinogen antibody binding was performed as previously described (30Nylander S. Mattsson C. Lindahl T.L. Thromb.

Antibody binding was detected by flow cytometry using a Beckman Coulter FacsCalibur by gating on the platelet population identified by characteristic forward and side scatter properties. Cyclic AMP levels in platelets treated with 0.1 ng/ml PGI2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Enzyme Immunoassay kit, Assay Designs) as previously described (31Li Z. Ajdic J. Eigenthaler M. Du X. Blood. 2003; 101: 4423-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Carotid Artery Thrombosis-Mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (1-2.5%), and their body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 1 °C by varying the output of an EPZ type halogen heat lamp. A flow probe (Model 0.5PSB, Transonic System Inc.) was placed on the left carotid artery. Thrombosis was initiated by the application of a 1 × 2-mm piece of filter paper (Whatman no. 3) to which 2 μl of a solution of 20% FeCl3 had been applied. The filter paper was removed after 3 min. The flow probe was used to record the time to thrombotic occlusion, which was defined as the time to cessation of >90% of the original blood flow for at least 30 s. To detect a prothrombotic phenotype in Enpp2+/- mice, the thrombosis model was modified by using two filter papers soaked in a solution of 2.5% FeCl3 (32Wang X. Cheng Q. Xu L. Feuerstein G.Z.

The two pieces of filter paper were placed on opposite sides of the vessel for 3 min, and blood flow was monitored as described above. Determination of LysoPLD Activity-Autotaxin/lysoPLD activity in mouse-citrated plasma or transfected HEK293 cell-conditioned medium was measured by the addition of a mixture of radiolabeled LPC ([1-14C]palmitoyl, 50,000 disintegrations per minute/assay) and cold LPC (1 μm) (18Boucharaba A.

After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, an equal volume of 0.04 m acetic acid was added, and LPA was extracted with 0.5 ml of water-saturated butanol. LPA was separated by TLC on silica gel plates in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water mix (50:30:8:4). Unreacted substrate and reaction products were excised from the plate and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Autotaxin/lysoPLD activity was also measured using the fluorogenic substrate FS-3 and with the non-selective phosphodiesterase substrate bis(para-nitrophenol)phosphate following methods that have been described in detail elsewhere (33Morris A.J. Smyth S.S. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 434: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of mouse tissues and plasma was performed with the 3D1 antibody (1:500), kindly provided by Dr. Junken Aoki (University of Tokyo), a polyclonal antibody raised against the peptide sequence in autotaxin CKKPDQHFKPYMKQHLPKRL (1:2000; Poly Sci), and a polyclonal antibody to amino acids 541-720 of autotaxin (Santa Cruz). Similar results were obtained with all antibodies. Preparation and Isolation of Recombinant Autotaxin-Autotaxin was expressed by transfection of suspension cultures of Chinese hamster ovary cells with a vector for expression of a fusion protein containing the human immunoglobulin κ chain leader sequence, a hexahistidine tag, and a cDNA sequence encoding amino acids 52-915 of human autotaxin-γ. Cells were cultured for 4 days in serum-free medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. The secreted His6-tagged autotaxin was purified from the culture medium of these cells by sequential metal ion affinity and gel filtration chromatography and was then exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline and concentrated to ∼1 mg/ml by centrifugal filtration. The purified protein was monomeric and in assays using para-nitrophenol phosphate ester substrates had a specific activity comparable with that reported for native autotaxin isolated from human or bovine plasma. Measurement of Plasma LPA Concentration-Plasma LPA levels were determined using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry with ABI-4000 Q-TRAP hybrid triple quadrupole/ion trap mass spectrometer coupled with an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography system following methods that have been described previously (34Georas S.N.

Lipids were separated on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column, 4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm using methanol/water/HCOOH, 79/20/0.5, v/v, with 5 mm NH4COOH as solvent A and methanol/acetonitrile/HCOOH, 59/40/0.5, v/v, with 5 mm NH4COOH as solvent B. LPA molecular species were analyzed in negative ionization mode with declustering potential, and collision energy was optimized for 17:0, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, and 20:4 LPA. Multiple reaction monitoring parameters for nine other LPA molecular species were selected with the closest possible approximation with available LPA standards. The following transitions were monitored: 407.0/153.0 (16:1 LPA); 409.0/153.1 (16:0 LPA); 423.0/153.1 (17:0 LPA (an unnatural LPA species used as an internal standard)); 431.0/153.0 (18:3 LPA); 433.0/153.0 (18:2 LPA); 435.1/152.9 (18:1 LPA); 437.0/153.0 (18:0 LPA); 455.1/153.0 (20:5 LPA); 457.0/153.0 (20:4 LPA); 459.1/153.0 (20:3 LPA); 461.1/153.0 (20:2 LPA); 481.1/153.0 (22:6 LPA); 483.1/153.0 (22:5 LPA); 485.1/153.0 (22:4 LPA). Measurement of Plasma Nucleotide Concentrations-Plasma levels of ATP, ADP, and adenosine were measured using minor adaptations of previously published procedures (35Borna C. Lazarowski E. van H.C.

In brief, plasma samples were collected directly into stop solution, deproteinated by extraction with perchloric acid, then neutralized by extraction with a mixture of tri-n-octylamine and Freon. HPLC analysis was performed using a Gilson system with a UV/visible absorbance detector. For measurements of ATP and ADP, samples were separated on a Wescan Anion/S column (100 × 4.6 mm) and eluted with a gradient of A = NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (1:1 molar ratio) at 25 mm total concentration in water, adjusted to pH 2.8 with acetic acid. B = NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (1:1 molar ratio) at 125 mm total concentration in water, adjusted to pH 2.9 with acetic acid. To measure plasma adenosine and inosine, samples were separated on an Altima HP C-18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) and eluted with a gradient of A 50 mm NaH2PO4 pH 4.0 with phosphoric acid, and B = A + 46% MeOH. LPA Is a Selective and Dose-dependent Inhibitor of Mouse Platelet Function-As part of our broader efforts to understand the role of the LPA axis in thrombosis, we investigated murine platelet responses to exogenously added LPA. In contrast to results obtained in parallel incubations with human platelets (Fig. 1A), neither LPA nor alkyl-LPA induced aggregation or shape change of washed or gel-filtered mouse platelets (Fig. 1B). No stimulatory effect of LPA was observed with platelets isolated from FVB, Balb/C, and C57Bl/6 mice (data not shown), excluding a strain difference as a potential explanation for this finding. LPA also did not stimulate calcium flux from washed mouse platelets (data not shown). When human platelets were incubated on fibrinogen-coated surfaces in the presence of LPA, actin reorganization occurred (Fig. 1C). LPA also promotes fibronectin matrix assembly in adherent human platelets (6Olorundare O.E. Peyruchaud O. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Neither actin reorganization (Fig. 1C) nor fibronectin matrix assembly (data not shown) was elicited by LPA treatment of mouse platelets, although murine platelets responded appropriately to ADP. Together, these results identify distinctive differences in agonist responsiveness of human and mouse platelets to LPA. The lack of a stimulatory effect of LPA on murine platelets is consistent with prior reports that LPA does not stimulate aggregation of rat platelets (37Schumacher K.A. Classen H.G. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1972; 275: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We and others have previously reported that platelets isolated from a subset of humans fail to aggregate in response to LPA (10Pamuklar Z. Lee J.S. Cheng H.Y. Panchatcharam M. Steinhubl S.

In some individuals the lack of platelet aggregation to LPA is associated with an ability of LPA to promote inhibitory signaling in platelets (10Pamuklar Z. Lee J.S. Cheng H.Y. Panchatcharam M.

To determine whether an LPA-mediated inhibitory signaling pathway predominates in mouse platelets, we tested the ability of LPA to inhibit agonist-induced murine platelet aggregation. LPA attenuated PAR-4-activating peptide-, low dose thrombin (0.01-0.05 units/ml)-, and ADP (1 μm)-induced aggregation of murine platelets (Fig. 2). The inhibitory effect of LPA on mouse platelets was dependent on the dose and type of agonist (Fig. 2, C and D). LPA did not affect platelet aggregation to higher doses of thrombin (>0.5 units/ml; Fig. 2, C and D) or to 1 μg/ml collagen (Fig. 2, A and B). The ability of LPA to inhibit aggregation was dose-dependent, with maximal inhibition observed at 1 μm LPA (Fig. 3A and data not shown). In agreement with the effects on aggregation, LPA also inhibited low dose, but not high dose, agonist-induced fibrinogen binding to murine platelets (Fig. 3B). LPA receptors are linked to G"

However, the native lipoproteins inherent to Gram-positive bacteria, which function as TLR2 ligands, have not been characterized. Here, we have purified a native lipoprotein to homogeneity from Staphylococcus aureus to study as a native TLR2 ligand. The purified 33-kDa lipoprotein was capable of stimulating TLR2 and was identified as a triacylated SitC lipoprotein, which belongs to a family of ATP binding cluster (ABC) transporter substrate-binding proteins. Analyses of the SitC-mediated production of cytokine using mouse peritoneal macrophages revealed that the SitC protein (3 nm) induced the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Moreover, analysis of knock-out mice showed that SitC required TLR2 and MyD88, but not TLR1 or TLR6, for the induction of cytokines. In addition to the S. aureus SitC lipoprotein, we purified two other native ABC transporter substrate-binding lipoproteins from Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus, which were both shown to stimulate TLR2. These results demonstrate that S. aureus SitC lipoprotein is triacylated and that the ABC transporter substrate-binding lipoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria function as native ligands for TLR2."
https://openalex.org/W2042076423,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The lack of tumor specificity remains a major drawback for effective chemotherapies and results in dose-limiting toxicities. However, a ligand-mediated drug delivery system should be able to render chemotherapy more specific to tumor cells and less toxic to normal tissues. In this study, we isolated a novel peptide ligand from a phage-displayed peptide library that bound to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The targeting phage bound to several NSCLC cell lines but not to normal cells. Both the targeting phage and the synthetic peptide recognized the surgical specimens of NSCLC with a positive rate of 75% (27 of 36 specimens). In severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing NSCLC xenografts, the targeting phage specifically bound to tumor masses. The tumor homing ability of the targeting phage was inhibited by the cognate synthetic peptide, but not by a control or a WTY-mutated peptide. When the targeting peptide was coupled to liposomes carrying doxorubicin or vinorelbine, the therapeutic index of the chemotherapeutic agents and the survival rates of mice with human lung cancer xenografts markedly increased. Furthermore, the targeting liposomes increased drug accumulation in tumor tissues by 5.7-fold compared with free drugs and enhanced cancer cell apoptosis resulting from a higher concentration of bioavailable doxorubicin. The current study suggests that this tumor-specific peptide may be used to create chemotherapies specifically targeting tumor cells in the treatment of NSCLC and to design targeted gene transfer vectors or it may be used one in the diagnosis of this malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1969429198,"Signals that control the fine balance between cell death and cell survival are altered during tumorigenesis. Understanding the mechanisms by which this balance is perturbed, leading to excessive cell survival, is important for designing effective therapies. Proteins belonging to the B-cell lymphoma (BCL) family are known to regulate death responses to apoptotic signals, especially those originating within cells. A subset of BCL family members capable of inhibiting cell death is known to contribute to tumorigenesis; however, it is not known whether all six antiapoptotic BCL family members play a causal role in tumor development. Using a mouse model of MYC-driven leukemia, we showed that, in addition to the well characterized BCL2 and BCLxl (BCL2L1), the other four family members—BCLw (BCL2L2), BCLb (BCL2L10), BFL1 (BCL2A1) and MCL1—also cooperate with MYC to accelerate leukemogenesis. In addition, high levels of each family member are found in either solid human tumors or cell lines derived from human leukemias or lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2037680322,"Acquisition of a transformed phenotype involves deregulation of several signal transduction pathways contributing to unconstrained cell growth. Understanding the interplay of different cancer-related signaling pathways is important for development of efficacious multitargeted anticancer drugs. The small molecule 9-aminoacridine (9AA) and its derivative, the antimalaria drug quinacrine, have selective toxicity for tumor cells and can simultaneously suppress nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activate p53 signaling. To investigate the mechanism underlying these drug activities, we used a combination of two-dimensional protein separation by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to identify proteins whose expression is altered in tumor cells by 9AA treatment. We found that 9AA treatment results in selective downregulation of a specific catalytic subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family, p110 gamma. Further exploration of this observation demonstrated that the mechanism of action of 9AA involves inhibition of the prosurvival AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway that lies downstream of PI3K. p110 gamma translation appears to be regulated by mTOR and feeds back to further modulate mTOR and AKT, thereby impacting the p53 and NF-kappaB pathways as well. These results reveal functional interplay among the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, p53 and NF-kappaB pathways that are frequently deregulated in cancer and suggest that their simultaneous targeting by a single small molecule such as 9AA could result in efficacious and selective killing of transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2063846665,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays an important role in HIV trafficking into the brain and the development of the central nervous system complications in HIV infection. Tight junctions are the main structural and functional elements that regulate the BBB integrity. Exposure of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3 cell line) to HIV-infected monocytes resulted in decreased expression of tight junction proteins, such as junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM)-A, occludin, and zonula occludens (ZO)-1. Control experiments involved exposure to uninfected monocytes. Alterations of tight junction protein expression were associated with increased endothelial permeability and elevated transendothelial migration of HIV-infected monocytes across an in vitro model of the BBB. Notably, overexpression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha or PPARgamma attenuated HIV-mediated dysregulation of tight junction proteins. With the use of exogenous PPARgamma agonists and silencing of PPARalpha or PPARgamma, these protective effects were connected to down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and proteasome activities. Indeed, the HIV-induced decrease in the expression of JAM-A and occludin was restored by inhibition of MMP activity. Moreover, both MMP and proteasome inhibitors attenuated HIV-mediated altered expression of ZO-1. The present data indicate that down-regulation of MMP and proteasome activities constitutes a novel mechanism of PPAR-induced protections against HIV-induced disruption of brain endothelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W1975757554,"Influenza pneumonia causes high mortality every year, and pandemic episodes kill millions of people. Influenza-related mortality has been variously ascribed to an ineffective host response that fails to limit viral replication, an excessive host inflammatory response that results in lung injury and impairment of gas exchange, or to bacterial superinfection. We sought to determine whether lung inflammation promoted or impaired host survival in influenza pneumonia.To distinguish among these possible causes of influenza-related death, we induced robust lung inflammation by exposing mice to an aerosolized bacterial lysate prior to challenge with live virus. The treatment induced expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 8- and 40-fold greater, respectively, than that caused by lethal influenza infection. Yet, this augmented inflammation was associated with striking resistance to host mortality (0% vs 90% survival, p = 0.0001) and reduced viral titers (p = 0.004). Bacterial superinfection of virus infected lungs was not observed. When mice were repeatedly exposed to the bacterial lysate, as would be clinically desirable during an influenza epidemic, there was no tachyphylaxis of the induced viral resistance. When the bacterial lysate was administered after the viral challenge, there was still some mortality benefit, and when ribavirin was added to the aerosolized bacterial lysate, host survival was synergistically improved (0% vs 93.3% survival, p<0.0001).Together, these data indicate that innate immune resistance to influenza can be effectively stimulated, and suggest that ineffective rather than excessive inflammation is the major cause of mortality in influenza pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W1992858669,"In this work, Photosystem I supercomplexes have been purified from Lhca-deficient lines of Arabidopsis thaliana using a mild detergent treatment that does not induce loss of outer antennas. The complexes have been studied by integrating biochemical analysis with electron microscopy. This allows the direct correlation of changes in protein content with changes in supramolecular structure of Photosystem I to get information about the position of the individual Lhca subunits, the association of the antenna to the core, and the influence of the individual subunits on the stability of the system. Photosystem I complexes with only two or three antenna complexes were purified, showing that the binding of Lhca1/4 and Lhca2/3 dimers to the core is not interdependent, although weak binding of Lhca2/3 to the core is stabilized by the presence of Lhca4. Moreover, Lhca2 and Lhca4 can be associated with the core in the absence of their ""dimeric partners."" The structure of Photosystem I is very rigid, and the absence of one antenna complex leaves a ""hole"" in the structure that cannot be filled by other Lhcas, clearly indicating that the docking sites for the individual subunits are highly specific. There is, however, an exception to the rule: Lhca5 can substitute for Lhca4, yielding highly stable PSI supercomplexes with a supramolecular organization identical to the WT."

The Chd2 heterozygous mutant mice exhibit increased extramedullary hematopoiesis and susceptibility to lymphomas. At the cellular level, Chd2 mutants are defective in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, accumulate higher levels of the chromatin-associated DNA damage response mediator, γH2AX, and exhibit an aberrant DNA damage response after X-ray irradiation.

Interestingly, a poor rate of reaction with hydrogen peroxide of KatG Compound (Cmpd) I prepared using alkyl peroxide was recently presented as evidence that the catalase mechanism in KatG diverges from the typical monofunctional enzyme pathway exemplified by bovine liver catalase (15Jakopitsch C. Vlasits J. Wiseman B. Loewen P.C. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A reaction between hydrogen peroxide and Cmpd I would be expected to constitute the second phase of the dismutation in which H2O2 acts as a two-electron reductant. A mechanism explaining the robust catalase activity exhibited by KatGs is therefore of special interest because novel mechanistic features are likely to be uncovered; Cmpd I is apparently not a catalytically competent intermediate, and high activity is absent from other homologous class I peroxidases. The near absence of catalase activity in KatG mutants in which replacements are made in the residues of the Met-Tyr-Trp (MYW) adduct strongly suggests a specific mechanistic role is filled by modification of the distal side residues. KatG dismutates hydrogen peroxide in a nonscrambling mechanism such that both oxygen atoms of dioxygen derive from the same molecule of hydrogen peroxide (16Vlasits J. Jakopitsch C. Schwanninger M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 52376-52381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Unlike classical catalases, however, which do not accumulate intermediates during H2O2 turnover because of very rapid rates of both the peroxide reduction and the peroxide oxidation steps, KatG forms a species characteristic of oxyferrous heme (peroxidase Cmpd III) in the presence of high concentrations of peroxide (11Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Jakopitsch C. Vlasits J. Wiseman B. Loewen P.C. Obinger C.

This intermediate is usually stable in peroxidases and is considered to be catalytically inert, but it must be highly unstable in KatG because catalase turnover occurs while the heme is in this form (In cytochrome c peroxidase oxyferrous heme is unstable because of internal redox chemistry involving Trp191, but cytochrome c peroxidase does not exhibit catalase activity (19Miller M.A. Bandyopadhyay D. Mauro J.M. Traylor T.G. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2789-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).) and the catalase activity of the W321F mutant of M. tuberculosis KatG is only moderately reduced (20Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the companion paper (69Zhao X. Yu S. Ranguelova K. Suarez J. Metlitsky L. Schelvis J.P.M. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7030-7037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), formation of oxyenzyme from the carbonyl enzyme shows that in WT KatG, oxyferrous heme is too stable to be a viable catalase intermediate unless some other unique feature produced in the oxyferrous enzyme formed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide alters its properties. A protein-based radical proposed here to be formed on the distal side amino acid adduct, which co-exists with oxyferrous heme when peroxide turnover occurs, is suggested to be a catalytically competent intermediate in catalase turnover in WT KatG. Our focus here is on identifying intermediates formed in M. tuberculosis KatG during catalase turnover. Stopped-flow optical kinetics techniques are applied to follow the changes in heme oxidation state in parallel with rapid freeze-quench-EPR experiments used to monitor the production and decay of protein-based radicals. A heretofore unknown narrow doublet radical signal is characterized by X-band and D-band EPR spectroscopy. DFT calculations provide additional insights into the structure of the radical. A reaction scheme originally suggested in other work (15Jakopitsch C. Vlasits J. Wiseman B. Loewen P.C. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) is described, incorporating the new radical proposed to be localized on the MYW adduct into the catalase reaction pathway. A detailed analysis of the catalase reaction mechanism in M. tuberculosis KatG, the only catalase found in M. tuberculosis, contributes to our understanding of the biology of this pathogen, which resides in host macrophages upon infection and is subjected to extensive oxidative stress in that environment. M. tuberculosis KatG was prepared from an overexpression system in Escherichia coli strain UM262, as published previously (21Marcinkeviciene J.A. Magliozzo R.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22290-22295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and was used usually within a few days of preparation. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Pairs of complementary primers (synthesized and purified by Operon Biotechnologies, Inc.) were designed to introduce the required mutations. The oligonucleotide pairs (mutated codons are in boldface) were as follows: Y390F, 5′-1153CGGGTGGATCCGATCTTTGAGCGGATCACGCGTC1186-3′ and 5′-1186GACGCGTGATCCGCTCAAAGATCGGATCCACCCG1153-3′ (4Yu S. Girotto S. Lee C. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14769-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); M255A, 5′-748GAGACGTTTCGGCGCGCGGCCATGAACGACGTC780-3′ and 5′-780GACGTCGTTCATGGCCGCGCGCCGAAACGTCTC748-3′. Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and the reaction products were transformed into the E. coli XL1-Blue strain for selection purposes. The presence of the mutated codons in the katG gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Gene Wiz, Inc.), and the mutated plasmid was electroporated into E. coli strain UM262 for protein overexpression. The mutants Y229F and W107F were prepared as reported previously (7Yu S. Girotto S. Zhao X. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44121-44127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Ranguelova K. Girotto S. Gerfen G.J. Yu S. Suarez J. Metlitsky L. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6255-6264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The catalase activity of purified KatG enzymes was evaluated optically based on the disappearance of H2O2, at pH 6 or 7, in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer or in 20 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 8.5, according to published procedures (23Beers Jr., R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No direct comparison is presented for the rate of catalase turnover measured optically and the intensity changes in RFQ-EPR measurements (described below) under identical conditions because of the large difference in sensitivity of the two techniques; high enzyme concentration is needed for detection of the radical in EPR spectra, whereas such conditions produce bubbling in solutions that strongly interfere with absorbance measurements. RFQ-EPR methodology has been published elsewhere (22Ranguelova K. Girotto S. Gerfen G.J. Yu S. Suarez J. Metlitsky L. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol.

The frozen powder is packed into precision bore EPR tubes, and the packed sample, which retains isopentane, is frozen in liquid nitrogen. For quantitative EPR, signal intensity is based on a copper standard, and the total intensity for RFQ samples is multiplied by 2 to correct for isopentane dilution. The foaming of solutions because of the rapid evolution of dioxygen leads to further dilution by an additional variable amount around 2-fold, but no further correction of EPR signal intensity was made. In some cases, manually mixed samples were prepared in borate buffer, pH 8.5, by mixing protein solution (∼100 μm) with an 8000-fold molar excess of H2O2, loading the mixture into precision bore EPR tubes, and immediately immersing the tube in liquid nitrogen. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker E500 ElexSys X-band spectrometer with samples held either in a finger Dewar for spectra at 77 K or in an Oxford liquid helium cryostat for lower temperatures. Signal averaging was employed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio when needed. Simulation of X-band EPR spectra was performed using SimFonia software (Bruker). Optical stopped-flow spectroscopy was performed using a HiTech 16-DX instrument as described elsewhere (4Yu S. Girotto S. Lee C. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol.

Cross-link Formation-To rule out the formation of dityrosine cross-links during catalase turnover, 10 μm WT KatG was incubated with 1000–8000-fold molar excess of H2O2 for 15 min at room temperature. SDS-PAGE of KatG from these samples was carried out using a PhastGel system (Amersham Biosciences). DFT Calculations-DFT calculations for the analysis of MYW adduct models were carried out using the Gaussian 03 program package (26Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E.

Molecular structures were optimized at the B3LYP/6–31G* level of theory in combination with the pruned 99-point Euler-Maclaurin radial grid and 590-point angular grid for all atoms. In addition to a single molecule approximation (gas phase model), a mimic of the protein environment of the MYW adduct was explored by employing the polarizable continuum model (27Cossi M.S.G. Rega N. Barone V. J. Chem. Phys. 2002; 117: 43-54Crossref Scopus (2230) Google Scholar) with various solvents spanning permittivity constants from 1 (vacuum) to about 80 (water). An initial geometry of the MYW adduct was built based on the coordinates for the covalently linked residues Met255, Tyr229, and Trp107 taken from the WT M. tuberculosis KatG structure (PDB entry 2CCA), from which we carried out a full optimization. All atoms of the side chains up to the C-α carbons (substituted by methyl groups) were optimized in the model. The relative position of the three C-α carbons and the two dihedral angles that freeze the rotations of the aromatic rings of the tyrosyl and tryptophanyl moieties with respect to their respective C-α atoms were kept constant retaining the values found in the x-ray structure. This set of constraints maintained the relative position of the MYW residues with respect to the backbone atoms (C-α carbons), whereas their relative position with respect to one another could be fully optimized. The natural spin population analysis of the radical models was carried out as implemented in the NBO 5.0 program package (28Glendening E.D.B.J.K. Reed A.E. Carpenter J.E. Bohmann J.A. Morales C.M. NBO 5.0. Theoretical Chemistry Institute, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI2001Google Scholar). Hyperfine coupling values for hydrogen atoms in the radical models were computed and compared with experimental data. Reliability of the chosen level of theory (B3LYP/6–31G*) to predict the spin distribution and hyperfine parameters was examined by comparison of the calculated electron spin densities in free tyrosyl and neutral tryptophanyl radicals to experimental values (29Bender C.J.

An increased size of basis sets (6–311G**) did not affect computed spin distribution or hyperfine parameters significantly. The g value calculations for the radicals were performed using the ADF program package (31Baerends E.J. Berger J.A. Bérces A. Bickelhaupt F.M. Bo C. de Boeij P.L. Boerrigter P.M. Cavallo L.

High Field-EPR D-band (130 GHz) spectra were obtained using a spectrometer assembled at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, that uses a quadrature detection bridge (100-milliwatt pulsed output) and probe supplied by HF EPR Instruments, Inc. (V. Krymov, New York). Cylindrical resonators operating in the TE011 mode provide typical π/2 pulse widths of 30–50 ns at maximum bridge power. The magnetic field is generated by a specially designed 7 tesla superconducting magnet with a ±0.5 tesla superconducting sweep/active shielding coil (Magnex Scientific). Frozen RFQ samples were held in quartz capillary tubes with inner and outer diameters of 0.5 and 0.6 mm, respectively, and an active volume of 0.2 μl. The frozen sample tubes were loaded into the probe under liquid nitrogen and inserted into the low temperature continuous flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments, Spectrostat model 86) and were maintained at 7 K to an accuracy of approximately ± 0.3 K using an ITC503 temperature controller. The magnetic field was calibrated to an accuracy of ∼2 G using a sample of Mn(II)-doped MgO (32Burghaus O. Rohrer M. Gotzinger T. Plato M. Mobius K. Meas. Sci. Technol. 1992; 3: 765-774Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Field-swept two-pulse (Hahn) echo detected spectra were obtained with 180° phase cycling of the first pulse to provide suppression of base-line artifacts. Specific experimental parameters are given in the figure legends. HF EPR spectra were simulated using software described previously (33van der Donk W.A. Stubbe J. Gerfen G.J. Bellew B.F. Griffin R.G.

To fit the 130 GHz echo-detected spectra, a weighted sum of two simulations having different gx values was required. Parameters for the simulations are given in the legend to Fig. 5. Uncertainty in the reported g values is ±0.00003 and for the hyperfine coupling value was ±0.5 G (33van der Donk W.A. Stubbe J. Gerfen G.J. Bellew B.F. Griffin R.G. J. Am. Chem.

Preparation of RFQ Samples for High Field EPR-The RFQ apparatus and its calibration for preparation of the high frequency EPR samples will be described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, it consists of a System 1000 syringe driving ram (Update Instruments, Madison, WI) and associated reactor hoses to produce a sample frozen at 35 ms and the following components designed and manufactured in-house: a Wiskind-type mixing chamber, an ejection nozzle, a freezing unit comprising copper-beryllium alloy wheels, and a sample collection basin. 4J. Manzerova, V. Krymov, and G. Gerfen, unpublished results. Two syringes of equal volume were mounted on the ram unit; one was filled with the KatG solution (150 μm) and the other with 600 mm H2O2. A 25-hole spraying nozzle was attached to the outlet of the aging hose. The reaction mixture was ejected through the nozzle onto the rapidly rotating (1500 rpm) copper-beryllium alloy wheels cooled with liquid nitrogen. The frozen solution was continuously scraped off the wheels by stainless steel blades and was collected as a fine powder under liquid nitrogen. This powder was then divided and packed into either standard size precision bore quartz EPR tubes (4 mm outer diameter) for measurements at X-band or into capillaries for D-band measurements. The 4-mm tubes were attached to a glass funnel using heat-shrink tubing, and this assembly was immersed in isopentane kept at -140 °C; the sample powder was transferred into the funnel with cold metal spatulas and packed using a stainless steel packing rod with a Teflon tip. A packing factor of 0.8 was determined separately by comparing the volume of frozen and then melted contents of a tube. A home-built platform immersed in liquid nitrogen was used to pack D-band capillary tubes. RFQ-EPR and Optical Stopped-flow Experiments-The high catalase activity of M. tuberculosis KatG is conveniently measured in the presence of millimolar H2O2 without enzyme degradation or apparent inhibition. Among the accumulated mechanistic details for this unusual behavior in a class I peroxidase are the findings of a nonscrambling mechanism shown in isotope-ratio experiments (16Vlasits J. Jakopitsch C. Schwanninger M. Holubar P. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the finding that superoxide is not a product during turnover (16Vlasits J. Jakopitsch C. Schwanninger M. Holubar P.

https://openalex.org/W2060034675,"Turner's syndrome (caused by monosomy of chromosome X) is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in females. Although 3% of all pregnancies start with XO embryos, 99% of these pregnancies terminate spontaneously during the first trimester. The common genetic explanation for the early lethality of monosomy X embryos, as well as the phenotype of surviving individuals is haploinsufficiency of pseudoautosomal genes on the X chromosome. Another possible mechanism is null expression of imprinted genes on the X chromosome due to the loss of the expressed allele. In contrast to humans, XO mice are viable, and fertile. Thus, neither cells from patients nor mouse models can be used in order to study the cause of early lethality in XO embryos. Human embryonic stem cells (HESCs) can differentiate in culture into cells from the three embryonic germ layers as well as into extraembryonic cells. These cells have been shown to have great value in modeling human developmental genetic disorders. In order to study the reasons for the early lethality of 45,XO embryos we have isolated HESCs that have spontaneously lost one of their sex chromosomes. To examine the possibility that imprinted genes on the X chromosome play a role in the phenotype of XO embryos, we have identified genes that were no longer expressed in the mutant cells. None of these genes showed a monoallelic expression in XX cells, implying that imprinting is not playing a major role in the phenotype of XO embryos. To suggest an explanation for the embryonic lethality caused by monosomy X, we have differentiated the XO HESCs in vitro an in vivo. DNA microarray analysis of the differentiated cells enabled us to compare the expression of tissue specific genes in XO and XX cells. The tissue that showed the most significant differences between the clones was the placenta. Many placental genes are expressed at much higher levels in XX cells in compare to XO cells. Thus, we suggest that abnormal placental differentiation as a result of haploinsufficiency of X-linked pseudoautosomal genes causes the early lethality in XO human embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2025324290,"Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a newly described cytokine produced after stimulation by IL-2 or IL-18 and IFN-gamma. IL-32 has the typical properties of a pro-inflammatory mediator and although its role in rheumatoid arthritis has been recently reported its effect on the osteoclastogenesis process remains unclear.In the present study, we have shown that IL-32 was a potent modulator of osteoclastogenesis in vitro, whereby it promoted the differentiation of osteoclast precursors into TRAcP+ VNR+ multinucleated cells expressing specific osteoclast markers (up-regulation of NFATc1, OSCAR, Cathepsin K), but it was incapable of inducing the maturation of these multinucleated cells into bone-resorbing cells. The lack of bone resorption in IL-32-treated cultures could in part be explain by the lack of F-actin ring formation by the multinucleated cells generated. Moreover, when IL-32 was added to PBMC cultures maintained with soluble RANKL, although the number of newly generated osteoclast was increased, a significant decrease of the percentage of lacunar resorption was evident suggesting a possible inhibitory effect of this cytokine on osteoclast activation. To determine the mechanism by which IL-32 induces such response, we sought to determine the intracellular pathways activated and the release of soluble mediators in response to IL-32. Our results indicated that compared to RANKL, IL-32 induced a massive activation of ERK1/2 and Akt. Moreover, IL-32 was also capable of stimulating the release of IL-4 and IFN-gamma, two known inhibitors of osteoclast formation and activation.This is the first in vitro report on the complex role of IL-32 on osteoclast precursors. Further clarification on the exact role of IL-32 in vivo is required prior to the development of any potential therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W2032515855,"The evolutionarily conserved structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins forms the core structures of three multisubunit complexes as follows: cohesin, condensin, and the Smc5/6 complex. These complexes play crucial roles in different aspects of chromosomal organization, duplication, and segregation. Although the architectures of cohesin and condensin are better understood, that of the more recently identified Smc5/6 complex remains to be elucidated. We have previously shown that the Smc5/6 complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains Smc5, Smc6, and six non-SMC elements (Nse1-6). In this study, we investigated the architecture of the budding yeast Smc5/6 complex employing the yeast two-hybrid assay as well as in vitro biochemical approaches using purified recombinant proteins. These analyses revealed that Smc5 and Smc6 associate with each other at their hinge regions and constitute the backbone of the complex, whereas the Nse1-6 subunits form three distinct subcomplexes/entities that interact with different regions of Smc5 and Smc6. The Nse1, -3, and -4 subunits form a stable subcomplex that binds to the head and the adjacent coiled-coil region of Smc5. Nse2 binds to the middle of the coiled-coil region of Smc5. Nse5 and Nse6 interact with each other and, as a heterodimer, bind to the hinge regions of Smc5 and Smc6. These findings provide new insights into the structures of the Smc5/6 complex and lay the foundation for further investigations into the mechanism of its functions."
https://openalex.org/W1995302047,"In this study, the potential role of Stat3 in UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis was examined using skin-specific gain and loss of function transgenic mice, that is, K5.Stat3C and K5Cre.Stat3fl/fl mice, respectively. The epidermis of Stat3-deficient mice was highly sensitive to UVB-induced apoptosis, whereas the epidermis of K5.Stat3C mice was more resistant to UVB-induced apoptosis. In particular, the status of Stat3 influenced the survival of ultraviolet-photoproduct cells, including those located in the hair follicles. K5.Stat3C mice exhibited significantly increased epidermal proliferation and hyperplasia in response to UVB irradiation, whereas Stat3-deficient mice showed reduced epidermal proliferation and hyperplasia. Expression of target genes regulated by Stat3, such as cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL, was increased in epidermis of both control and UVB-irradiated K5.Stat3C mice, and downregulated in epidermis of both control and UVB-irradiated K5Cre.Stat3fl/fl mice. Following UVB irradiation, the formation of skin tumors in K5.Stat3C mice was accelerated and both the incidence and multiplicity of skin tumors were significantly greater than wild-type controls. In contrast, Stat3-deficient mice were resistant to UVB skin carcinogenesis. These results show that Stat3 plays an important role in the development of UVB-induced skin tumors through its effects on both survival and proliferation of keratinocytes during carcinogenesis."

The aim of this study was to clarify the role of the HSPG interaction in canonical APRIL signaling, because it has been proposed to act as a docking site and also to play a role in direct signaling. In this study, we generated point mutants of soluble APRIL that lack either the capacity to bind HSPGs or TACI and BCMA and then tested the function of these mutants in mouse B-cell assays. In contrast to previous reports, we found that APRIL alone is sufficient to costimulate B-cell proliferation and drive IgA production and does not require artificial antibody cross-linking. We found no evidence that APRIL requires signaling through HSPGs but, notably, were able to show that binding of APRIL to HSPGs is crucial for mediating natural APRIL cross-linking to allow for optimal activation of murine B cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980740520,"Methylation of the mRNA 5′ guanosine cap is essential for efficient gene expression. The 5′ methyl cap binds to eIF4E, which is the first step in the recruitment of mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit. To investigate whether mRNA cap methylation is regulated in a gene-specific manner, we established a method to detect the relative level of cap methylation on specific mRNAs. We found that two transcription factors, c-Myc and E2F1, induce cap methylation of their transcriptional target genes, and therefore, c-Myc and E2F1 upregulate gene expression by simultaneously inducing transcription and promoting translation. c-Myc-induced cap methylation is greater than transcriptional induction for the majority of its target genes, indicating that this is a major mechanism by which Myc regulates gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2098508359,"We have previously shown that the angiogenic growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN) induces migration of endothelial cells through binding to its receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta (RPTPbeta/zeta). In this study, we show that a monoclonal antibody against alpha(nu)beta(3) but not alpha(5)beta(1) integrin abolished PTN-induced human endothelial cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner. Integrin alpha(nu)beta(3) was found to directly interact with PTN in an RGD-independent manner, whereas a synthetic peptide corresponding to the specificity loop of the beta(3) integrin extracellular domain ((177)CYDMKTTC(184)) inhibited PTN-alpha(nu)beta(3) interaction and totally abolished PTN-induced endothelial cell migration. Interestingly, alpha(nu)beta(3) was also found to directly interact with RPTPbeta/zeta, and PTN-induced Y773 phosphorylation of beta(3) integrin was dependent on both RPTPbeta/zeta and the downstream c-src kinase activation. Midkine was found to interact with RPTPbeta/zeta, but not with alpha(nu)beta(3), and caused a small but statistically significant decrease in cell migration. In the same line, PTN decreased migration of different glioma cell lines that express RPTPbeta/zeta but do not express alpha(nu)beta(3), while it stimulated migration of U87MG cells that express alpha(nu)beta(3) on their cell membrane. Overexpression or down-regulation of beta(3) stimulated or abolished, respectively, the effect of PTN on cell migration. Collectively, these data suggest that alpha(nu)beta(3) is a key molecule that determines the stimulatory or inhibitory effect of PTN on cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2088388436,"Sphingolipids and phosphoinositides both play signaling roles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although previous data indicate independent functions for these two classes of lipids, recent genetic studies have suggested interactions between phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phosphate effectors and sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes. The present study was undertaken to further define the effects of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) metabolism on cell sphingolipid metabolism. The data presented indicate that deletion of SAC1, a gene encoding a PtdIns(4)P phosphatase, increased levels of most sphingolipid species, including sphingoid bases, sphingoid base phosphates, and phytoceramide. In contrast, sac1Δ dramatically reduced inositol phosphosphingolipids, which result from the addition of a PtdIns-derived phosphoinositol head group to ceramides through Aur1p. Deletion of SAC1 decreased PtdIns dramatically in both steady-state and pulse labeling studies, suggesting that the observed effects on sphingolipids may result from modulation of the availability of PtdIns as a substrate for Aur1p. Supporting this hypothesis, acute attenuation of PtdIns(4)P production through Stt4p immediately increased PtdIns and subsequently reduced sphingoid bases. This reduction was overcome by the inhibition of Aur1p. Moreover, modulation of sphingoid bases through perturbation of PtdIns(4)P metabolism initiated sphingolipid-dependent biological effects, supporting the biological relevance for this route of regulating sphingolipids. These findings suggest that, in addition to potential signaling effects of PtdInsP effectors on sphingolipid metabolism, PtdIns kinases may exert substantial effects on cell sphingolipid profiles at a metabolic level through modulation of PtdIns available as a substrate for complex sphingolipid synthesis.

Sphingolipids play vital roles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including regulation of translation, cell cycle, sporulation, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, endocytosis, stress responses, and numerous other processes (see Refs. 1Dickson R.C.

Sphingolipid metabolism has been reviewed extensively, but, in brief, sphingolipid synthesis begins with the condensation of palmitoyl-coenzyme A and serine by serine-palmitoyl transferase to form 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (12Pinto W.J. Wells G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2575-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This short-lived intermediate is quickly converted to the sphingoid bases dihydrosphingosine (DHS) 2The abbreviations used are: DHS, dihydrosphingosine; IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; PHS, phytosphingosine; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdIns(4)P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PtdIns(4,5)P, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; GFP, green fluorescent protein. and phytosphingosine (PHS), which undergo phosphorylation to form sphingoid base phosphates or N-acylation to form ceramides (13Nagiec M.M.

Phytoceramide and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) are used as substrates by Aur1p to form inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), which may then be converted into other complex sphingolipids (15Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). PtdIns and its derivatives serve well established signaling roles in both mammalian cells and S. cerevisiae, which contains three PtdIns 4-kinases producing distinct pools of PtdIns(4)P (5Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar): Stt4p, which resides at the plasma membrane (16Audhya A. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar); Pik1p, which is primarily located at the Golgi (17Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar); and Lsb6p, which is located at the plasma and vacuolar membranes (18Han G.S. Audhya A. Markley D.J. Emr S.D. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47709-47718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Notably, Stt4p is the only wortmannin-sensitive PtdIns 4-kinase in S. cerevisiae (19Cutler N.S. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27671-27677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additionally, the PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase Mss4p uses PtdIns(4)P produced by Stt4p as its substrate (5Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Importantly, the Sac1p lipid phosphatase, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, primarily regulates the pool of PtdIns(4)P generated by Stt4p in vivo (20Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Some interactions between PtdIns pathways and sphingolipid metabolism have been probed using yeast genetic strategies, and several recent studies have focused on regulation of sphingolipid metabolic processes by PtdIns(4,5)P2 effector signaling (see Ref. 21Dickson R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 909-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar for review). PtdIns(4,5)P2 effectors have been proposed to regulate sphingolipid levels by influencing ceramide synthesis and Isc1p activity (Refs. 8Bultynck G. Heath V.L. Majeed A.P. Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4729-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Aronova S. Wedaman K. Aronov P.A. Fontes K. Ramos K. Hammock B.D. Powers T.

Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 909-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, mechanistic data are largely lacking. The effects on sphingolipids of abrogating Sac1p activity have not previously been evaluated. Although mechanistic information is scarce, a few studies provide hints that PtdIns metabolism may influence sphingolipid levels through substrate level interactions. For example, the IPC synthase Aur1p consumes PtdIns by transfer of its inositol phosphate head group to phytoceramide, forming IPC and diacylglycerol (15Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of inositol to the culture media decreased ceramide levels as IPC and, it was inferred, PtdIns increased (22Alvarez-Vasquez F. Sims K.J. Cowart L.A. Okamoto Y. Voit E.O. Hannun Y.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); however, these effects have not been demonstrated in cells with perturbed PtdIns metabolic pathways. Furthermore, it has also been shown that inhibition of IPC synthesis increased the immediate metabolic precursor, ceramides (23Cerbon J. Falcon A. Hernandez-Luna C. Segura-Cobos D. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but the effect on other sphingolipids, including signaling sphingolipids, remains unclear. Together, these results raise tantalizing possibilities about the potential for turnover between PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns to regulate sphingolipid synthesis through nonsignaling mechanisms. We undertook the current study to determine whether modulating turnover of the pool of PtdIns(4)P regulated by Sac1p and Stt4p significantly impacts sphingolipid metabolism. Data indicated that deletion of SAC1 increased levels of sphingoid bases without increasing de novo sphingolipid synthesis. Additionally, phytoceramide and sphingoid base phosphate levels were also elevated. In contrast to these effects, deletion of SAC1 decreased complex sphingolipids, whereas inhibition of Stt4p with wortmannin increased them. Deletion of SAC1 decreased PtdIns levels dramatically, whereas acute inhibition of Stt4p increased PtdIns, indicating that these effects may occur via substrate supply. Additionally, it was shown that treatment with wortmannin reduced sphingoid bases, and inhibition of IPC synthase overcame this decrease, supporting IPC synthesis as the point of interaction. These data support a substrate level metabolic interaction between sphingolipid levels and PtdIns(4)P turnover by Sac1p and Stt4p; this interaction appears to occur independently of recently proposed PtdIns(4,5)P2 effector signaling. Finally, using nutrient permease levels as a readout, it was demonstrated that these changes affect a biologically relevant pool of sphingoid bases. Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions-The yeast strains used in this study are shown in Table 1 with their genotypes. Single deletion mutants in the BY4742 background were obtained from the Euroscarf yeast deletion library. [3H]Serine (ART 246) and [3H]inositol (0116B) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Routine cultures were seeded from 5-ml overnight cultures into yeast-protease-dextrose medium, which contains 1% yeast extract, 2% proteose peptone, and 2% dextrose and grown in a water bath at 30 °C with shaking at 200–250 rpm. For routine experiments, excepting those using radioactivity, cultures were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and then aliquotted into 50-ml Falcon tubes and incubated in a water bath at 30 °C with shaking at 200–250 rpm. For heat stress, the tubes were transferred to an identical water bath at 39 °C with shaking at 200–250 rpm. Wortmannin was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and aureobasidin A was purchased from Takara Bio USA (Madison, WI). The cells were treated for 10 min with wortmannin or 20 min with aureobasidin A. Myriocin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The cells were treated for 5 or 15 min with myriocin, as indicated.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeBY4742MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0BY4742:sac1ΔMATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 sac1Δ::G418BY4742:cnb1ΔMATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 cnb1Δ::G418BY4742:slm1ΔMATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 slm1Δ::G418BY4742:slm2ΔMATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 slm2Δ::G418 Open table in a new tab Sphingoid Base Measurements-After treatment as described, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 3500 × g at room temperature for 3–5 min followed by resuspension in 3 ml of 2:1 chloroform:methanol. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). One-third of the sample was used for total lipid phosphate determination as described previously (25Saheki S. Takeda A. Shimazu T. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The remaining two-thirds were subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis and resolved by HPLC as described previously (26Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The peaks were quantified based on signal derived from an internal standard (l-threo-phytosphingosine). Labeling Studies-For pulse labeling studies, the cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in yeast-protease-dextrose medium from the original culture. Wortmannin (10 μg/ml) was added immediately prior to labeling as indicated. [3H]Inositol (20 μCi/ml) was added. Aliquots of 0.5 ml were taken after 10 min and pipetted into five volumes of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid solution. Lipids were extracted and resolved by TLC in a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:NH4OH (9:7:2) as described previously (27Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For steady-state labeling, the cells were grown to saturation and seeded in SD complete medium containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]inositol. The cells were grown for 21 h to mid-logarithmic phase. As indicated above, aliquots of 0.5 ml were taken, and lipids were extracted and resolved by TLC. The bands visualized by this method were scraped and quantified by liquid scintillation. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Measurements-After treatment as described, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 3500 × g at room temperature for 3–5 min, snapfrozen in an methanol/solid CO2 bath, and analyzed as described previously (28Cowart L.A. Okamoto Y. Lu X. Hannun Y.A. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Western Blot-The cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase, treated as specified, harvested by centrifugation, flash-frozen, and stored at –80 °C until ready for protein isolation. Then cells were washed in 20 ml of sterile water, pelleted, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, containing 40 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science. Glass beads were added to resuspended pellets, and the cells were vortexed for four periods of 30 s intercalated with 30 s on ice. The extract was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. Additional buffer was added to the pellet, and the cells were again vortexed as above. The extracts were combined, and protein concentration was measured by BCA analysis using the Pierce Micro BCA protein assay kit from Fisher. Protein was adjusted to ∼2 μg/μl, and the samples were boiled and subsequently analyzed by Western blot using 10 μg of total protein/lane, as described previously (29Chung N. Jenkins G. Hannun Y.A. Heitman J. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:5000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). They were again washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and then visualized using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Deletion of SAC1 Increases Sphingoid Bases-Previous reports have demonstrated changes in sphingolipid metabolism accompanying perturbation of PtdIns metabolism (11Tabuchi M. Audhya A. Parsons A.B. Boone C. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5861-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Additionally, phenotypic overlaps between sphingolipid and phosphoinositide metabolism mutants may indicate a functional connection. For example, altered sphingoid base levels result in defects in endocytosis and actin organization (29Chung N. Jenkins G. Hannun Y.A. Heitman J. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Chung N. Mao C. Heitman J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35614-35621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); deletion of the PtdIns(4)P-phosphatase Sac1p also causes defects in these processes (20Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To determine whether sphingolipid metabolism was altered by perturbation of PtdIns(4)P pools, sphingolipids were measured in a sac1Δ strain, which exhibits a 7–10-fold increase in PtdIns(4)P (20Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Tahirovic S. Schorr M. Mayinger P. Traffic. 2005; 6: 116-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Deletion of SAC1 increased C18 PHS over 5-fold compared with wild type cells and also significantly increased C20 species (Fig. 2). These data suggested that preventing Sac1p-mediated hydrolysis of PtdIns(4)P to PtdIns increased sphingoid base levels. Deletion of SAC1 Does Not Increase de Novo Sphingoid Base Synthesis-The increase in bases in sac1Δ might be attributed to either increased de novo synthesis or decreased conversion into downstream metabolites. Two complementary approaches were used to determine whether de novo synthesis was the source of the accumulation of bases observed in sac1Δ. To assess whether the increased sphingoid bases in sac1Δ resulted from increased de novo synthesis, sphingoid bases were measured in cells treated with myriocin, a selective inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase (32Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In the wild type, a 15-min treatment with myriocin reduced basal sphingoid bases by 65% with respect to wild type control levels (a reduction of 2.45 pmol/nmol phosphate) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, a 5-min shift to the heat stress temperature of 39 °C, which is known to increase sphingoid bases via de novo synthesis, increased total bases to 257% of controls, and this increase was completely attenuated by myriocin treatment (total bases 66% of control) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, myriocin demonstrated relatively little effect in sac1Δ, with sphingoid base levels reduced by only 16% of mutant controls after 15 min (a reduction of 1.74 pmol/nmol phosphate) (Fig. 3A). Because sac1Δ mutants maintained elevated base levels after inhibition of de novo sphingoid base synthesis, this suggests that the elevated bases derive from an alternate mechanism. A second approach was used to verify this result. Previous work has shown that the mechanism of increasing de novo sphingolipid synthesis during heat stress involves an increased rate of uptake of media serine, which was necessary and sufficient to drive de novo sphingoid base production (33Cowart L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12330-12340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the downstream PtdIns(4,5)P2 effectors Slm1 and Slm2 colocalize with Pma1 (34Fadri M. Daquinag A. Wang S. Xue T. Kunz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1883-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which regulates nutrient uptake through modulation of the proton gradient at the plasma membrane (35Sychrova H. Kotyk A. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was possible that deletion of the PtdIns(4)P 4-phosphatase may increase serine uptake indirectly and, consequently, increase sphingoid base levels. However, measurement of serine uptake demonstrated the opposite effect. Specifically, the rate of uptake of [3H]serine in sac1Δ was only 64% of the rate in wild type cells (0.215 ± 0.015 nmol serine·106 cells–1·min–1 in wild type versus 0.077 ± 0.009 nmol serine·106 cells–1·min–1 in sac1Δ) (Fig. 3C). These data may actually suggest a reduced rate of de novo sphingolipid synthesis in sac1Δ and, in addition to data in Fig. 3A, indicate that de novo synthesis does not likely mediate the increase in sphingoid bases observed in sac1Δ. Deletion of SAC1 Increases Phytoceramide and Sphingoid Base Phosphates-Because elevation of sphingoid bases in the sac1Δ strain did not appear to occur through de novo synthesis, we hypothesized that the increase in bases may result from reduced incorporation into their downstream metabolites, sphingoid base phosphates, and ceramides. Previous data indicate that inhibiting the production of individual sphingolipids can increase concentrations of neighboring metabolites. Specifically, inhibition of ceramide synthesis by lag1Δ and lac1Δ increased sphingoid base phosphates, and deletion of sphingoid base kinases increased sphingoid bases and ceramides. 3A. L. Cowart and Y. A. Hannun, unpublished results. To determine the impact of sac1Δ on total sphingolipid profiles, lipid extracts were used for high throughput lipidomic analysis as previously described. These data indicated that, in contrast to decreased levels of downstream metabolites, sac1Δ produced little change in dihydroceramide and increased phytoceramide to 182% of wild type (Fig. 4A). Additionally, dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate increased 27-fold, and phytosphingosine-1-phosphate increased 8-fold (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that the mechanism for increased sphingoid bases in sac1Δ does not likely involve inhibition of incorporation into immediate downstream metabolites (i.e. ceramides and/or base phosphates) and indicated an alternate mechanism for the observed sphingoid base increase. Deletion of SAC1 Decreases Complex Sphingolipids-In yeast, ceramides serve as a substrate for inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) synthesis through Aur1p. IPC then undergoes modification with mannose and an additional inositol phosphate group to generate mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide and mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide (36Smith E.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, the dramatic elevation in phytoceramide levels suggested that there may be an increase in complex sphingolipids. To test this hypothesis, the cells were grown for 21 h in the presence of [3H]inositol, and complex sphingolipids were extracted, resolved by thin layer chromatography, and quantified by liquid scintillation. Surprisingly, despite robust increases in sphingoid bases, sphingoid base phosphates, and ceramides (Figs. 2 and 4), complex sphingolipid levels decreased dramatically in sac1Δ. In sac1Δ cells, IPC levels were 20% of wild type, mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide levels were 32% of wild type, and mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide levels were 38% of wild type (Fig. 5A). This steady-state labeling study indicates a reduction in complex sphingolipid mass in sac1Δ and may suggest a slower rate of complex sphingolipid synthesis in this mutant. Therefore, a pulse labeling strategy was utilized to determine whether sac1Δ decreased the rate of flux through complex sphingolipid synthesis. The cells were incubated for 10 min in the presence of [3H]inositol, and lipids were extracted and resolved as described under “Materials and Methods.” As in the steady-state labeling experiment, pulse labeling demonstrated a decrease in complex sphingolipids in sac1Δ (Fig. 5B), indicating that elimination of Sac1p activity decreased both the flux and mass of complex sphingolipids. Inhibition of Stt4p Increases Flux through Complex Sphingolipids-The lipid phosphatase Sac1p primarily targets the pool of PtdIns(4)P produced by Stt4p (20Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To determine whether the decrease in complex sphingolipids in sac1Δ results from altered turnover of PtdIns(4)P/PtdIns, cells were treated with the Stt4p inhibitor wortmannin (19Cutler N.S. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27671-27677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which has been demonstrated to decrease PtdIns(4)P. The cells pulse-labeled with [3H]inositol in the presence of wortmannin increased both IPC and mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide relative to untreated controls (Fig. 5B). Thus, inhibition of Stt4p, which decreases consumption of PtdIns for PtdIns(4)P synthesis, increased complex sphingolipids. Conversely, deletion of SAC1, which decreases regeneration of the PtdIns pool and increases PtdIns(4)P (20Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), decreased complex sphingolipids. Together, these results suggest that PtdIns/PtdIns(4)P dynamics through Stt4p and Sac1p impact complex sphingolipid synthesis, which may occur through modulation of PtdIns available for complex sphingolipid synthesis. Deletion of SAC1 Reduces PtdIns Levels-Because complex sphingolipid synthesis requires PtdIns as a substrate (15Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar), regulation of PtdIns levels provides one potential mechanism by which Sac1p may affect complex sphingolipid synthesis (Fig. 1). Indeed, previous data indicate that deletion of SAC1 decreased PtdIns (37Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34294-34300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Supporting the hypothesis of a substrate level effect, steady-state labeling revealed that the sac1Δ strain, which harbors reduced complex lipids, showed labeled PtdIns levels at only 6.0% of wild type (Fig. 5C). During pulse labeling, sac1Δ decreased PtdIns by 31% of wild type, whereas treatment with the Stt4p inhibitor wortmannin increased PtdIns to 169% of wild type (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that dynamics of the Sac1p/Stt4p-mediated pool of PtdIns(4)P significantly impact cellular PtdIns levels, which raised the possibility that they impact complex sphingolipid synthesis by limiting PtdIns substrate available to Aur1p. Inhibition of IPC Synthase Ameliorates Reduction in Sphingoid Bases by Wortmannin-The data strongly suggested that deleting SAC1 reduced the PtdIns available for complex sphingolipid synthesis. This concept is supported by the literature, which indicates that sphingolipid metabolism represents a highly interconnected network. In previous studies, treatment with aureobasidin A, which inhibits the IPC synthase Aur1p (38Heidler S.A. Radding J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2765-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), increased ceramides while reducing levels of diacylglycerol, the other product of the IPC synthesis reaction (23Cerbon J. Falcon A. Hernandez-Luna C. Segura-Cobos D. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of inositol to"

Here, we studied the ability of JAK1 V658F and A634D to activate the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway upon ectopic expression in HEK293 cells alone or together with the other components of the interleukin-9 receptor complex (IL-9Rα, γc, and JAK3). Expression of JAK1 mutants alone failed to trigger STAT activation, but co-expression of the IL-9Rα chain promoted JAK1 mutant phosphorylation and STAT activation. Mutation of the FERM domain of JAK1, which is critical for cytokine receptor association, or of the single tyrosine of IL-9Rα involved in STAT recruitment abolished this activity, indicating that JAK1 mutants need to associate with a functional IL-9Rα to activate STAT factors. Several lines of evidence indicated that IL-9Rα homodimerization was involved in this process. IL-9Rα variants with mutations of the JAK-interacting BOX1 region not only failed to promote JAK1 activation but also acted as dominant negative forms reverting the effect of wild-type IL-9Rα. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments also showed the formation of IL-9Rα homodimers. Interestingly, STAT activation was partially inhibited by expression of γc, suggesting that overlapping residues are involved in IL-9Rα homodimerization and IL-9Rα/γc heterodimerization. Co-expression of wild-type JAK3 partially reverted the inhibition by γc, indicating that JAK3 cooperates with JAK1 mutants within the IL-9 receptor complex. Similar results were observed with IL-2Rβ. Taken together, our results show that IL-9Rα and IL-2Rβ homodimers efficiently mediate constitutive activation of ALL-associated JAK1 mutants.

JAK2 V617F retains its ability to interact with cytokine receptors (6Vainchenker W. Constantinescu S.N. Hematology Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ.

Blood. 2008; 111: 3751-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At physiological levels of expression, JAK2 V617F needs to be associated to JAK2 binding homodimeric type I cytokine receptors such as the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) or the thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) to allow constitutive signaling (8Lu X. Levine R. Tong W. Wernig G. Pikman Y. Zarnegar S. Gilliland D.G. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18962-18967Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Lu X. Huang L.J.

Constitutive and increased erythropoietin or thrombopoietin signaling provide a mechanism for the erythocytosis and thrombocytosis observed in these disorders (11Staerk J. Kallin A. Demoulin J.B.

The A572V mutation in JAK3 has later been identified in patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (12Walters D.K. Mercher T. Gu T.L. O’Hare T. Tyner J.W. Loriaux M. Goss V.L. Lee K.A. Eide C.A.

Moreover, these A634D and R724H mutants induce the autonomous growth of the cytokine-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, whereas the A634D and R879C mutants protect the murine ALL cell line BW5147 from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, indicating that they represent gain of function mutations. However, the potential role of JAK1 binding receptors, which are all heterodimeric, in the mechanism of mutant JAK1-induced constitutive signaling has never been studied. IL-9 is a multifunctional TH2 cytokine that was shown to be involved in T cell tumorigenesis in mouse and in humans (15Renauld J.C. van der Lugt N. Vink A. van Roon M. Godfraind C. Warnier G. Merz H.

Moreover, in vitro dysregulation of the IL-9 response is associated with autonomous cell growth and malignant transformation of lymphoid cells, leading to the constitutive activation of JAK-STAT pathway (19Uyttenhove C.

Its activities are mediated via a heterodimeric receptor complex formed by the IL-9Rα chain (IL-9Rα), which associates with JAK1, and the IL-2Rγ chain, also called γc (common γ chain), which associates with JAK3. γc is in addition involved in IL-2, -4, -7, -15, and -21 signaling, a family of cytokines involved in lymphocyte development and/or activation. IL-9Rα is sufficient to confer high affinity cytokine binding, but formation of the heterodimeric complex with γc is needed for signal transduction (21Knoops L. Renauld J.C. Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Upon IL-9 binding, JAK1 and JAK3 are cross-activated, and IL-9Rα is phosphorylated on a single tyrosine (Tyr-116). This phosphorylated tyrosine is the only docking site for STAT1, -3, and -5, the STATS activated by IL-9 (22Demoulin J.B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. DeLestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this paper, in order to study the potential interactions between ALL-associated JAK1 mutants and the different components of IL-9 receptor complex, we co-expressed these different proteins in HEK293 cells, which lack IL-9Rα, γc, and JAK3. Our data show that JAK1 mutants alone fail to activate STAT transcriptional factors but that this process/activation is promoted by IL-9Rα homodimerization in the absence of γc and JAK3. Cells and Cell Culture-HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. These cells do not express endogenous IL-9Rα, γc, and JAK3. Human fibrosarcoma U4C cells (JAK1-deficient) and γ2A cells (JAK2-deficient) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant human IL-9 was produced in the baculovirus system in our laboratory and was purified as previously described (23Druez C. Coulie P. Uyttenhove C. Van Snick J. J.

Transient transfection of HEK293, COS-7, U4C, and γ2A cells by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was previously described (29Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well 1 day before transfection. Transfection was carried out according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using 250 ng of the appropriate constructs, 500 ng of pGL3-pap1 or pLHRE reporter plasmids, 50 ng of pRLTk control plasmid, and empty vector to normalize total transfected DNA to 1.5 μg. 4 h after transfection cells were stimulated or left unstimulated for 20 h. 24 h after transfection cells were lysed by 150 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer 1× supplied by Promega. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Western Blots-For Western blot analysis, 106 HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates 1 day before transient transfection. In brief, HEK293 cells were transfected with 3.75 μg of different constructs depending on the experimental settings using a standard calcium phosphate transfection procedure (Promega). The day after transfection cells were collected and lysed in 250 μl of Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) using a 20-gauge syringe. Cellular lysates were boiled for 3 min before loading 20 μlon 12% precast Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C; Amersham Biosciences). After blocking the membranes in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline-Tween (TBS-Tween), immunoblotting was performed by overnight incubations at 4 °C with primary antibodies in 0.1% TBS-Tween, using the dilution recommended by the manufacturer. After 3 × 5 min of washing in 0.1% TBS-Tween, the membranes were incubated with secondary anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or anti-mouse-HRP antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), diluted 1/5000 in 5% phosphate-buffered saline-TBS-Tween. After 3 × 5 min of washing, a SuperSignal West Pico detection kit (Pierce) and Kodak Biomax Light Film were used for detection. The following phosphospecific antibodies were used: anti-pY1001/1002 JAK1 and anti-pY705 Stat3 (Cell Signaling Technology). Blots were re-probed with anti-JAK1, anti-STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies as control. Immunoprecipitation-For immunoprecipitation, 6 × 106 HEK293 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates 1 day before transfection. The day after, cells were co-transfected using a standard calcium phosphate transfection procedure (Promega) with the 7 μg of Myc-tagged IL-9Rα together with 7 μg of HA-tagged IL-9Rα or HA-tagged EpoR. The day after transfection, cells were collected and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold modified radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations) (22Demoulin J.B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. DeLestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) using a 20-gauge syringe and kept 30 min on ice. Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-c-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz) and 20 μl of protein-G-agarose (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitates were boiled, subjected to Tris-glycine gel electrophoresis, and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA1.1 (Covance) and anti-c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz). Washing and detection were performed as described above. FACS Analysis of IL-9Rα Cell Surface Expression-The cell surface expression of the different IL-9Rα constructs was verified by FACS on an aliquot of the cells used for the luciferase assay 1 day after transient transfection. FACS analysis was performed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer after staining cells with biotinylated anti-human IL-9Rα antibody (22Demoulin J.B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. DeLestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) followed with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (BD Biosciences) As a control, an aliquot of the transfected cells was stained only with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (BD Biosciences) antibody. Reverse Transcription and Quantitative PCR-Total RNA was extracted from the aliquot of the HEK293 cells used for the luciferase assay 1 day after transient transfection. Roughly 5 × 105 cells was used to extract RNA using the TriPure isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed on 1 μg of total RNA with an oligo-(dT) primer (Roche Applied Science) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcription (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR reactions were performed using primer sets corresponding to murine JAK1 or human JAK1 with qPCR™ Mastermix for SYBR® Green I (Eurogentec). A series of dilutions of the respective PCR product subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) was used a standard for quantification. The sequences of the species-specific JAK1 primers (final concentration, 300 nm) were: mJAK1, 5′-GGAGTGCAGTATCTCTCCTCTCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCATGCCCAGGCACTCATTTTCA-3′ (reverse); hJAK1, 5′-TCTTGGAATCCAGTGGAGGCATAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACTCTTCCCGGATCTTGTTTTTCT-3′ (reverse). Samples were first heated for 2 min at 50 °C then 10 min at 95 °C. cDNA was amplified by 40 cycles of a two-step PCR program at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Melting point analysis was carried out by heating the amplicon from 60 to 95 °C. ALL-associated JAK1 Mutants (V658F and A634D) Induce Constitutive STAT Activation in the Presence of IL-9Rα-ALL-associated JAK1 mutants induce constitutive signaling after ectopic expression in Ba/F3 or BW5147 hematopoietic cells (13Flex E. Petrangeli V. Stella L. Chiaretti S. Hornakova T. Knoops L. Ariola C. Fodale V. Clappier E. Paoloni F. Martinelli S. Fragale A. Sanchez M. Tavolaro S. Messina M. Cazzaniga G. Camera A. Pizzolo G. Tornesello A. Vignetti M. Battistini A. Cave H. Gelb B.D. Renauld J.C. Biondi A. Constantinescu S.N. Foa R. Tartaglia M. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These cells presumably express many receptor complexes that could bind the mutant JAKs and promote constitutive signaling. To study the role of such receptors, we co-expressed components of the IL-9 receptor complex together with JAK1 mutants in HEK293 cells, which are deficient for γc, IL-9Rα, and JAK3. Expression of two ALL-associated JAK1 mutants alone (V658F and A634D) did not induce a significant increase in the level of STAT3 transcriptional activity as assessed by a luciferase assay (Fig. 1). However, co-expression of IL-9Rα with JAK1 mutants (but not WT JAK1) in the absence of JAK3 and γc increased STAT3 activation. Similar results were obtained for STAT5 activation using pLHRE-luc reporter and with the pGRR5-luc reporter, which also responds to STAT1 (data not shown). Stimulation with IL-9 had no effect on IL-9Rα-mediated activation of STAT3 by JAK1 mutants, which is in line with the fact that, in the absence of JAK3 and γc, IL-9 receptor signaling complex cannot support IL-9-induced signal transduction. To prove that mutant JAK1-induced STAT3 activation was dependent on the presence of a functional IL-9Rα, we co-expressed the defective IL-9Rα Y116F, in which the only STAT-recruiting tyrosine residue Tyr-116 was mutated to phenylalanine. We previously showed that this mutation abolishes STAT activation by IL-9 (22Demoulin J.B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. DeLestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As expected, co-expression of the defective IL-9Rα Y116F did not promote mutant JAK1-induced constitutive STAT3 signaling (Fig. 1), indicating that recruitment of STATs by the IL-9Rα phosphotyrosine was necessary for mutant JAK1-induced constitutive signaling. These results contrast with a previous report showing that expression of JAK1 V658F in JAK1-deficient U4C fibrosarcoma cells allows for constitutive STAT3 activation (11Staerk J. Kallin A. Demoulin J.B. Vainchenker W. Constantinescu S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41893-41899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To address the hypothesis that this apparent discrepancy was due to the lack of expression of endogenous JAK1 in U4C cells, we measured STAT3 activation in JAK1-deficient U4C or JAK2-deficient γ2A fibrosarcoma cells transfected with wild-type or V658F JAK1. In U4C cells expression of JAK1 V658F alone allowed for constitutive STAT3 activation (8-fold increased luciferase production, as compared with wild-type JAK1). However, co-expression of IL-9Rα chain induced a further 3-fold increase in STAT3 activation (supplemental Fig. 1A). By contrast, in γ2A cells expression of JAK1 V658F only marginally increased (1.6-fold) STAT3 transcriptional activity unless the IL-9Rα chain was co-expressed (supplemental Fig. 1B). To confirm that JAK1 V658F constitutive activity in U4C cells results from the absence of expression of wild-type JAK1, we cotransfected both isoforms into U4C cells. Co-expression of increasing amounts of wild-type JAK1 together with the JAK1 V658F significantly decreased STAT3 activation (supplemental Fig. 1C). Y107A Mutation in the FERM Domain of JAK1 Mutants Abolishes Constitutive STAT3 Activation-To prove that the JAK1 mutants need to associate to IL-9Rα to constitutively activate STAT3, we mutated tyrosine residue Tyr-107 to alanine in the FERM domain of JAK1 V658F and A634D. Several residues conserved within the FERM domain of JAKs are crucial for cytokine receptor binding (30Saharinen P. Takaluoma K. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and the Y107A mutation within the FERM domain of JAK1 has been shown to abolish JAK1 binding to the gp130 receptor chain (24Haan C. Is’harc H. Hermanns H.M. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Grotzinger J. Behrmann I. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 2 for two different cell lines (HEK293 and COS-7 cells), the Y107A mutation also abolished the capacity of JAK1 mutants to activate STAT3 in the presence of IL-9Rα. These results indicate that an intact FERM domain of JA"
https://openalex.org/W1991654592,"Large networks of proteins govern embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency. Recent analysis of the critical pluripotency factors Oct4 and Nanog has identified their interaction with multiple transcriptional repression complexes, including members of the mSin3A-HDAC complex, suggesting that these factors could be involved in the regulation of Oct4/Nanog function. mSin3A is critical for embryonic development, but the mechanism by which the mSin3A-HDAC complex is able to regulate ES cell pluripotency is undefined. Herein we show that the mSin3A-HDAC complex positively regulates Nanog expression in ES cells through Sox2, a critical ES cell transcription factor and regulator of Nanog. We have identified the mSin3A-HDAC complex to be present at the Nanog promoter only under proliferating conditions concurrent with histone acetylation. We find that Sox2 associates with mSin3A-HDAC complex members both in vitro and in vivo, similar to the interactions found between Oct4/Nanog and the mSin3A-HDAC complex. Knockdown of mSin3A-HDAC complex members or HDAC inhibitor treatment reduces Nanog expression, and overexpression of mSin3A-HDAC complex subunits stimulates Nanog expression. Our data demonstrate that the mSin3A-HDAC complex can positively regulate Nanog expression under proliferating conditions and that this activity is complementary to mSin3A-mediated p53-dependent silencing of Nanog during differentiation."

Elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanism of the amyloid fibril formation is crucial not only to develop a controlling strategy toward the disease, but also to apply the protein fibrils for future biotechnology. Discernable homogeneous granules of alpha-synuclein composed of approximately 11 monomers in average were isolated in the middle of a lag phase during the in vitro fibrillation process. They were demonstrated to experience almost instantaneous fibrillation during a single 12-min centrifugal membrane-filtration at 14,000 x g. The granular assembly leading to the drastically accelerated fibril formation was demonstrated to be a result of the physical influence of shear force imposed on the preformed granular structures by either centrifugal filtration or rheometer. Structural rearrangement of the preformed oligomomeric structures is attributable for the suprastructure formation in which the granules act as a growing unit for the fibril formation. To parallel the prevailing notion of nucleation-dependent amyloidosis, we propose a double-concerted fibrillation model as one of the mechanisms to explain the in vitro fibrillation of alpha-synuclein, in which two consecutive concerted associations of monomers and subsequent oligomeric granular species are responsible for the eventual amyloid fibril formation."

Here, we test the hypothesis that Ca(2+) influx through canonical transient receptor potential 3 (TRPC3) channels modulates insulin-mediated glucose uptake in adult skeletal muscle. Experiments were performed on adult skeletal muscle cells of wild-type (WT) and obese, insulin-resistant ob/ob mice. Application of the diacylglycerol analog 1-oleyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) induced a nonselective cation current, which was inhibited by the addition of anti-TRPC3 antibody in the patch pipette and smaller in ob/ob than in WT cells. Knockdown of TRPC3, using a novel technique based on small interfering RNA (siRNA) coupled to functionalized carbon nanotubes, resulted in pronounced (approximately 70%) decreases in OAG-induced Ca(2+) influx and insulin-mediated glucose uptake. TRPC3 and the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) coimmunoprecipitated, and immunofluorescence staining showed that they were colocalized in the proximity of the transverse tubular system, which is the predominant site of insulin-mediated glucose transport in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, our results indicate that TRPC3 interacts functionally and physically with GLUT4, and Ca(2+) influx through TRPC3 modulates insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Thus, TRPC3 is a potential target for treatment of insulin-resistant conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2035278288,"The ergot fungus Claviceps purpurea produces both ergopeptines and simple d-lysergic acid alkylamides. In the ergopeptines, such as ergotamine, d-lysergic acid is linked to a bicyclic tripeptide in amide-like fashion, whereas in the d-lysergylalkanolamides it is linked to an amino alcohol derived from alanine. We show here that these compound classes are synthesized by a set of three non-ribosomal lysergyl peptide synthetases (LPSs), which interact in a combinatorial fashion for synthesis of the relevant product. The trimodular LPS1 assembles with LPS2, the d-lysergic acid recruiting module, to synthesize the d-lysergyltripeptide precursors of ergopeptines from d-lysergic acid and the three amino acids of the peptide chain. Alternatively, LPS2 can assemble with a distinct monomodular non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) subunit (ergometrine synthetase) to synthesize the d-lysergic acid alkanolamide ergometrine from d-lysergic acid and alanine. The synthesis proceeds via covalently bound d-lysergyl alanine and release of dipeptide as alcohol with consumption of NADPH. Enzymatic and immunochemical analyses showed that ergometrine synthetase is most probably the enzyme LPS3 whose gene had been identified previously as part of the ergot alkaloid biosynthesis gene cluster in C. purpurea. Inspections of all LPS sequences showed no recognizable peptide linkers for their protein-protein interactions as in NRPS subunits of bacteria. Instead, they all carry conserved N-terminal domains (C0-domains) with similarity to the C-terminal halves of NRPS condensation domains pointing to an alternative mechanism of subunit-subunit interactions in fungal NRPS systems. Phylogenetic analysis of LPS modules and the C0-domains suggests that these enzyme systems most probably evolved by module duplications and rearrangements from a bimodular ancestor."

Due to technological obstacles, the time course and extent of reprogramming of cells following fusion has not been assessed to date. Here, we show that hundreds of genes are activated or repressed within hours of fusion of human keratinocytes and mouse muscle cells in heterokaryons, and extensive changes are observed within 4 days. This study was made possible by the development of a broadly applicable approach, species-specific transcriptome amplification (SSTA), which enables global resolution of transcripts derived from the nuclei of two species, even when the proportions of species-specific transcripts are highly skewed. Remarkably, either phenotype can be dominant; an excess of primary keratinocytes leads to activation of the keratinocyte program in muscle cells and the converse is true when muscle cells are in excess. We conclude that nuclear reprogramming in heterokaryons is rapid, extensive, bidirectional, and dictated by the balance of regulators contributed by the cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2091393178,"Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a zinc-finger transcription factor with tumor suppressive activity in colorectal cancer. Here, we investigated whether KLF4 is involved in maintaining genetic stability in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from mice wild type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-), or homozygous (-/-) for the Klf4 alleles. Compared to Klf4(+/+) and Klf4(+/-) MEFs, Klf4(-/-) MEFs had both a higher level of apoptosis and rate of proliferation. Quantification of chromosome numbers showed that Klf4(-/-) MEFs were aneuploid. A higher number of Klf4(-/-) MEFs exhibited gamma-H2AX foci and had higher amounts of gamma-H2AX compared to controls. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated the presence of numerous chromosome aberrations including dicentric chromosomes, chromatid breaks, and double minute chromosomes in Klf4(-/-) cells but in few, if any, Klf4(+/+) or Klf4(+/-) MEFs. Approximately 25% of Klf4(-/-) MEFs exhibited centrosome amplification in contrast to the less than 5% of Klf4(+/+) or Klf4(+/-) MEFs. Finally, only Klf4(-/-) MEFs were capable of anchorage-independent growth. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that MEFs null for the Klf4 alleles are genetically unstable, as evidenced by the presence of aneuploidy, chromosome aberration and centrosome amplification. The results support a crucial role for KLF4 in maintaining genetic stability and as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1974294025,"Unlike the vast majority of flavoenzymes, bacterial luciferase requires an exogenous source of reduced flavin mononucleotide for bioluminescence activity. Within bioluminescent bacterial cells, species-specific oxidoreductases are believed to provide reduced flavin for luciferase activity. The source of reduced flavin in Escherichia coli-expressing bioluminescence is not known. There are two candidate proteins potentially involved in this process in E. coli, a homolog of the Vibrio harveyi Frp oxidoreductase, NfsA, and a luxG type oxidoreductase, Fre. Using single gene knock-out strains, we show that deletion of fre decreased light output by greater than two orders of magnitude, yet had no effect on luciferase expression in E. coli. Purified Fre is capable of supporting bioluminescence in vitro with activity comparable to that with the endogenous V. harveyi reductase (Frp), using either FMN or riboflavin as substrate. In a pull-down experiment, we found that neither Fre nor Frp co-purify with luciferase. In contrast to prior work, we find no evidence for stable complex formation between luciferase and oxidoreductase. We conclude that in E. coli, an enzyme primarily responsible for riboflavin reduction (Fre) can also be utilized to support high levels of bioluminescence."

Disruption of the TGF-β signaling pathway often occurs in colorectal cancers. Earlier, we have shown that TGF-β induces apoptosis through the transcription factor Smad3. Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays were used to identify TGF-β/Smad3 target genes that regulate apoptosis in rat intestinal epithelial cells (RIE-1). We found that TGF-β repressed the expression of the inhibitor of differentiation (Id) gene family. Knockdown of Id1 and Id2 gene expression induced apoptosis in RIE-1 cells, whereas overexpression of Id2 attenuated TGF-β-induced apoptosis. TranSignal Protein/DNA arrays were used to identify the hypoxia-inducing factor-1 (HIF-1) as a downstream target of TGF-β. HIF-1 is a basic helix-loop-helix protein, and overexpression of Id2 blocked HIF-1 activation by TGF-β. Furthermore, knockdown of HIF-1 blocked TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Thus, we have identified HIF-1 as a novel mediator downstream of Id2 in the pathway of TGF-β-induced apoptosis."

However, little is known about the effects of these flights on humoral immunity. We previously immunized adult Pleurodeles waltl (urodele amphibian) onboard the Mir space station and showed that heavy-chain variable (VH) domains of specific IgM antibodies are encoded by genes belonging to the VHII and VHVI families. We have now determined how these animals use their individual VHII and VHVI genes by screening IgM heavy-chain cDNA libraries and by quantifying IgM heavy-chain transcripts encoded by these genes. Results were compared with those obtained using control animals immunized on Earth under the same conditions as onboard Mir. Our experiments revealed an increase in the expression of IgM heavy-chain mRNAs encoded by the VHII and VHVI.C genes and a strong decrease in the expression of IgM heavy-chain mRNAs encoded by the VHVI.A and VHVI.B genes in spaceflight animals. Consequently, different heavy-chain mRNAs are expressed by spaceflight animals, demonstrating that this environment affects the humoral response. These observations may be due to a change in B-cell selection under spaceflight conditions."

The enzyme is reduced by NADPH rapidly but has a very slow oxidative half-reaction using in vitro transcribed tRNA substrates. Using tRNALeu purified from a DUS 2 knockout strain of yeast we obtained reaction rate enhancements of 600-fold over in vitro transcribed substrates, indicating that other RNA modifications are required for rapid uracil reduction. This demonstrates a previously unknown ordering of modifications and indicates that dihydrouridine formation is a later step in tRNA maturation. We also show that an active site cysteine is important for catalysis, likely in the protonation of uracil during tRNA reduction. Dihydrouridine of modified tRNA from Escherichia coli was also oxidized to uridine showing the reaction to be reversible.

We also show that an active site cysteine is important for catalysis, likely in the protonation of uracil during tRNA reduction. Dihydrouridine of modified tRNA from Escherichia coli was also oxidized to uridine showing the reaction to be reversible. Dihydrouridine is one of the most common modified nucleosides present in the tRNAs of eubacteria, eukaryotes, and some archea (1Sprinzl M. Steegborn C. Hübel F. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res... 1996; 24: 68-72Google Scholar). This modified nucleoside is formed by the reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond in uridine at specific sites in tRNAs, most commonly in the D-loop. Our understanding of the physiological role of dihydrouridine is still in its infancy, but one possibility is a structural role. NMR studies have shown that dihydrouridine increases the flexibility of the RNA backbone to allow alternate conformations because its non-planar structure disrupts stacking (2Dalluge J.J. Hashizume T. Sopchik A.E. McCloskey J.A. Davis D.R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1996; 24: 1073-1079Google Scholar). In addition, a role for dihydrouridine in conformational flexibility is also suggested by its distribution among different species. The dihydrouridine content of species adapted to cold environments (psychrophiles) is the highest found in nature, whereas thermophilic species tend to have much less or no dihydrouridine (3Noon K.R. Guymon R. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Thomm M. Lim J. Cavicchiolo R. J. Bacteriol... 2003; 185: 5483-5490Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the chemical stability of RNA structures is enhanced by the absence of dihydrouridine, perhaps explaining why thermophilic species often lack dihydrouridine, to avoid hydrolytic ring opening at high temperatures (4House C.H. Miller S.L. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 315-320Google Scholar). Recent studies have hinted at further physiological roles for dihydrouridine. tRNA lacking dihydrouridine, along with other modifications, degrades at a substantially increased rate, approaching that seen for mRNA (5Alexandrov A. Chernyakov I. Gu W. Hiley S.L. Hughes T.R. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 21: 87-96Google Scholar). The main function of dihydrouridine may therefore be to protect tRNAs from degradation. It has long been known that dihydrouridine levels are increased in cancerous tissues (6Kuchino Y. Borek E. Nature.. 1978; 271: 126-129Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the human dihydrouridine synthase 2 is responsible for the increased dihydrouridine levels formed in pulmonary carcinogenesis (7Kato T. Daigo Y. Hayama S. Nobuhisa I. Yamabuki T. Ito T. Miyamoto M. Kondo S. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 5638-5646Google Scholar). This information suggests that dihydrouridine plays an important role in preventing tRNA turnover. The family of enzymes catalyzing the reduction of uridine in tRNA, dihydrouridine synthases (DUS), 3The abbreviations used are: DUS, dihydrouridine synthase; DTT, dithiothreitol. has recently been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. DUSs from S. cerevisiae were identified by biochemical assays of pooled yeast proteins (8Xing F. Hiley S.L. Hughes T.R. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 17850-17860Google Scholar), whereas the enzymes from E. coli were identified by a bioinformatics approach (9Bishop A.C. Xu J. Johnson R.C. Schimmel P. de Crécy-Lagard V. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 25090-25095Google Scholar). Sequencing and annotation of many microbial genomes suggests the presence of DUSs in a wide number of species. The enzymes from S. cerevisiae are NADPH-dependent with non-overlapping RNA specificity (10Xing F. Martzen M.R. Phizicky E.M. RNA.. 2002; 8: 370-381Google Scholar). From recent structural and homology models, and from analogies to other flavoenzymes that act on pyrimidines, putative active site residues can be assigned. The crystal structure of the enzyme from Thermotoga maritima (11Park F. Gajiwala K. Noland B. Wu L. He D. Molinari J. Loomis K. Pagarigan B. Kearins P. Christoper J. Peat J. Badger J. Hendle J. Lin J. Buchanan S. Proteins.. 2004; 55: 772-774Google Scholar) has a conserved cysteine residue positioned within a suitable distance to protonate the uracil ring as it is reduced. Although some aspects of dihydrouridine formation are becoming better understood, there have been no studies on the kinetics of these enzymes. To better understand how these enzymes function we have investigated the catalytic mechanism of DUS 2 from S. cerevisiae and an active site cysteine mutant. We find that the enzyme is able to reduce tRNA and, surprisingly, prefers modified tRNA substrates to in vitro transcribed tRNAs. We also show that the active site cysteine is important for catalysis, likely acting to protonate the uracil ring. Materials—NADP and NADPH were from Research Products International.

Single colonies were used to inoculate 5 ml of LB, which was shaken at 400 rpm overnight in a 37 °C incubator. From these cultures 1 ml was added to 1 liter of LB containing 0.1 g/liter ampicillin. The cells were grown to an A600 of 0.8 and induced using 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) and grown for 5–6 h at 37 °C. The DUS-containing cells were pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 20 min) and resuspended in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol. The cells were sonicated for 15 min on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min). The clarified supernatant was then passed over a 3.8-cm × 10-cm TALON metal affinity column from Clontech, which had been loaded with cobalt(II) acetate and pre-equilibrated with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol. The column was then washed with 3 column-volumes of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and the protein was eluted from the column with the same buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluted enzyme was then washed extensively with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol in an Amicon ultrafiltration device (10,000 molecular weight cut-off). Wild-type DUS 2 was stored at 4 °C with 1 mm DTT after elution from the metal affinity column. The DTT was removed by a PD-10 desalting column immediately prior to experiments. The enzyme obtained by metal affinity purification showed a single band on SDS-PAGE at ∼43 kDa. However, the absorbance spectrum of the enzyme purified in this way had an unusual peak at 340 nm in addition to the expected flavin absorbance. Therefore the enzyme was purified further to remove this contaminant by applying it to a 3.8-cm × 14-cm DEAE-Sepharose column at 25 °C, which was pre-equilibrated in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol. The column was washed extensively with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol. The yellow fractions containing protein free of the contaminating chromophore were collected. Protein that remained bound to the column was eluted with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol and showed a proportionately higher 340 nm peak. Enzyme fractions free of the chromophore were pooled, concentrated, washed with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and stored at 4 °C. Purification of Mature tRNALeu—Mature tRNALeu was purified from a S. cerevisiae YNR015w knockout strain. A total of 80 liters of yeast cultured in YPD (10 g of yeast extract, 20 g of peptone, 20 g of glucose, 1 liter of H2O) were grown to saturation by shaking at 30 °C in 1-liter flasks. The yeast was pelleted at ∼5000 × g for 15 min and frozen until use. The frozen cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm LiCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 0.1% SDS and thawed to room temperature. Soluble RNA was then extracted with phenol-chloroform buffered to pH 4.7 and centrifuged (4200 × g for 30 min). The RNA in the supernatant was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol and 0.2 m LiCl. The RNA was washed with 70% ethanol, frozen, and lyophilized. The tRNA was purified further on an oligonucleotide column made by treating NHS-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) with an aminated oligonucleotide (IDT Technologies, Coralville, IA) complementary to the 3′-end of tRNALeu-CCA. The tRNA was heated to 50 °C in 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and loaded on the column. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, heated to 50 °C, and eluted in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5. Enzyme Concentrations—The extinction coefficient of the enzyme was determined by recording the absorbance spectrum of the enzyme, adding SDS (1% final concentration), and recording the spectrum of the FMN liberated upon protein unfolding. The extinction coefficient was calculated from the ratio of the absorbance of the free FMN (12Whitby G. Biochem. J... 1953; 54: 437-442Google Scholar) to that of the native enzyme. The extinction coefficient at 457 nm was 12,800 m–1 cm–1 in 50% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 55 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. Enzyme concentrations were routinely determined spectrophotometrically using this extinction coefficient and are given in terms of active site concentrations. Reaction Kinetics—Enzyme solutions for kinetics were made anaerobic in glass cuvettes or tonometers by multiple cycles of evacuation followed by equilibration with an atmosphere of purified argon (13Palfey B.A. Kinetic Analysis of Macromolecules: A practical Approach.(Johnson, K. A., ed) pp. Oxford University Press, New York. 2003; 236: 203-228Google Scholar). When reduced enzyme was needed, a gas-tight syringe containing a dithionite solution (∼6mm) was attached to the cuvette, and the anaerobic enzyme was titrated to complete reduction with one equivalent of dithionite, as judged by absorbance spectroscopy. Reactions were performed at 4 °C using 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol unless stated otherwise. Absorbance spectra were obtained over time using a Shimadzu UV-2501PC scanning spectrophotometer for slow oxidative half-reactions; rapid reactions were studied anaerobically using a Hi-Tech Scientific SF-61DX2 stopped-flow spectrophotometer using published techniques (13Palfey B.A. Kinetic Analysis of Macromolecules: A practical Approach.(Johnson, K. A., ed) pp. Oxford University Press, New York. 2003; 236: 203-228Google Scholar). Binding Titrations—Binding titrations were carried out in quartz fluorescence cuvettes at 25 °C in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol in a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorophotometer. Enzyme (∼20 μm) was titrated with increasing concentrations of ligands. Excitation was at 450 nm, and emission was scanned from 460 to 650 nm, with a maximum fluorescence change observed at 517 nm. For weak or moderate binding, the change in fluorescence was plotted against the concentration of ligand and fit to Equation 1. ΔF=ΔFmaxLKD+L(Eq.1) Tight binding was fit to Equation 2ΔF=ΔFmax[E0+L0+KD−(E0+L0+KD)2−4E0L02](Eq.2) tRNA Synthesis—tRNAs were produced in reactions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, 20 mm of each NTP, T7 RNA polymerase, and DNA template (10 ng/μl). The templates for each reaction were synthesized by PCR using two complementary primers (Invitrogen) comprising the entire tRNA gene to be transcribed, and a T7 RNA polymerase promoter upstream. The sequence of the S. cerevisiae pre-tRNALeu substrate and intronless variant used were GGTTGTTTGGCCGAGCGGTCTAAGGCGCCTGATTCAAGCTCAGGTATCGTAAGATGCAAGAGTTCGAATCTCTTAGCAACCA and GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTTGTTTGGCCGAGCGGTCTAAGGCGCCTGATTCAAGCTCAGGTATCGTAAGATGCAAGAGTTCGAATCTCTTAGCAACCA, respectively. Synthetic tRNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction to remove RNA polymerase, and the RNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. The RNA concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 256 nm using extinction coefficients predicted from the base composition tRNA using the nearest neighbor method (14Kallansrud G. Ward B. Anal. Biochem... 1996; 236: 134-138Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients of 1,019,100 m–1 cm–1 was used for the S. cerevisiae pre-tRNALeu and an extinction of 764,800 m–1 cm–1 was used for the intronless and modified tRNALeu purified from S. cerevisiae. Before use tRNA was heated to 65 °C for 10 min and cooled on ice for 5 min to ensure proper folding of the tRNA. Dihydrouridine Assay—Dihydrouridine produced by the reduction of tRNA was determined using a colorimetric assay (15Hunninghake D. Grisolia S. Anal. Biochem... 1966; 16: 200-205Google Scholar). tRNA (125 μm in 0.3 ml) was treated with 0.03 ml of 1 m KOH and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, hydrolyzing the dihydrouridine ring. The sample was then acidified with 0.15 ml of 1 m H2SO4, and 0.3 ml of a solution of 10 mm 2,3-butanedione-2-oxime and 5 mm N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine was added. The sample was heated for 5 min at 95 °C in a heating block and cooled to 50 °C for 5 min, 0.3 ml of 10 mm FeCl3 was added, and the absorbance at 550 nm was read. Concentrations were determined by comparison with a standard curve determined from known concentrations of dihydrouracil with a linear range between 20 and 250 μm. Preparation of [4-2H]NADPH—[4R-2H]NADPH was prepared as described by Ottolina et al. (16Ottolina G. Riva S. Carrea G. Danieli B. Buckmann A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1989; 998: 173-178Google Scholar). A 10-ml solution of 50 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, 0.5 m 2-d-isopropanol, 13 mm NADP, and 20 units of Thermoanaerobacter brockii alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma) was incubated at 30 °C for 4 h. The solution was diluted to 20 ml with H2O and chromatographed on a 2.8-cm × 40-cm DE-53 column (carbonate form). The [4R-2H]NADPH was eluted with a sodium bicarbonate gradient (0–0.5 m, 500 ml). Fractions with a ratio of A254/A340 of 2.5 or less were pooled and lyophilized. The lyophilized product was chromatographed with water on a 2-cm × 50-cm Sephadex G-10 column to remove salt (17Engel P.C. Anal. Biochem... 1977; 82: 512-552Google Scholar). Fractions containing [4R-2H]NADPH were pooled, and the product was precipitated with 70% acetone at 4 °C to concentrate, dissolved in a minimal amount of water, and lyophilized. [4S-2H]NADPH was prepared in a 6-ml solution of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm 1-d-glucose, 15 mm ATP, 15 mm NADP, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 units of hexokinase, and 100 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 5 h, and the [4S-2H]NADPH was purified as described above. Stereochemistry—The stereochemistry of oxidation of NADPH by the enzyme was determined by incubating 1.5 ml of an aerobic solution containing 2 mm [4R-2H]NADPH, 100 μm of DUS, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 in D2O at 35 °C. After [4R-2H]NADPH was completely oxidized (no absorbance at 340 nm; ∼2 h), enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra 10,000 molecular weight cut-off), and a 300-MHz 1H NMR spectrum was recorded using the water peak as a chemical shift reference (4.2 ppm). An identical procedure was used for [4S-2H]NADPH. Identification of tRNAs Bound to DUS—tRNA bound to the enzyme after purification by the metal affinity column was extracted with phenol-chloroform to remove the protein and precipitated with ethanol to yield the pure tRNA. Mixtures of ∼3.5 μmol of tRNA were incubated in a 10-ml reaction at pH 7.4 in 100 mm potassium Pi with 0.8 mm of each amino acid, 10 mm ATP, and 2880 units of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from E. coli (Sigma A3646-10KU) to ensure complete aminoacylation of the tRNAs. The reactions were incubated for 18 h and extracted with phenolchloroform, and the tRNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. The tRNA was dissolved in 200 μl of 100 μm potassium Pi, pH 9.0, and incubated for 5 h to hydrolyze the aminoacyl-esters. The tRNA was separated from the amino acids by ultrafiltration with 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Microcon centrifugal filtration devices (Amicon) previously washed with H2O. The flow-through was collected and analyzed by the Protein Facility of the Office of Biotechnology, Iowa State University, on an automated Beckman System Gold HPLC amino acid analyzer. The catalytic cycles of flavoenzymes frequently have a reductive half-reaction, in which one substrate reduces the flavin, and an oxidative half-reaction, in which another substrate oxidizes the flavin (Fig. 1). However in many flavoenzymes, the second substrate binds and reacts before the first product is released, deviating from the typical ping-pong mechanism. Transient kinetic experiments were performed to determine the mechanism followed by the flavoenzyme DUS 2 from S. cerevisiae. NADPH has been reported to be the reducing substrate for the DUS 2 enzyme from S. cerevisiae (10Xing F. Martzen M.R. Phizicky E.M. RNA.. 2002; 8: 370-381Google Scholar). The reductive half-reaction of DUS 2 is proposed to start with NADPH binding to the enzyme (Fig. 1). The NADPH then transfers a hydride to the active site flavin prosthetic group, reducing the enzyme. Finally NADP dissociates, yielding free reduced enzyme. In attempting to further understand the mechanism of reduction we investigated the stereofacial selectivity of NADPH oxidation. [4R-2H]NADPH and [4S-2H]NADPH were oxidized, and the NADP produced was analyzed by 1H NMR. When [4R-2H]NADPH was the substrate, a proton signal was observed at 8.4 ppm for the proton at the 4-position of the nicotinamide ring of NADP, the product, indicating that the R-deuteron was transferred (data not shown). When [4S-2H]NADPH was used, the NADP produced lacked the signal at 8.4 ppm, indicating retention of the S-deuteron and transfer of the R-hydrogen. Therefore, DUS is specific for the proR hydrogen of NADPH. The kinetics of the reductive half-reaction were studied at 4 °C by mixing 15 μm anaerobic oxidized enzyme with anaerobic solutions of NADPH in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The absorbance of the flavin, monitored at 450 nm, decreased in three phases (Fig. 2). The first phase, which contributed the majority of the absorbance decrease and represents flavin reduction, had an observed rate constant that increased hyperbolically with NADPH concentration. Fitting the observed rate constant to Equation 3 give a maximum rate constant of 2.5 ± 0.2 s–1 at saturating NADPH. kobs=kred[NADPH]KD+[NADPH](Eq.3) The y-intercept of the plot of the observed rate constant did not differ significantly from zero, indicating that the reverse rate constant is very small and the maximum of 2.5 s–1 is the rate constant for flavin reduction. A KD of 190 ± 35 μm was determined from the dependence of the observed rate constant on the concentration of NADPH (18Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem... 1975; 250: 4048-4052Google Scholar). Two other exponentials, together accounting for ∼30% of the absorbance decrease, were seen in these traces, with rate constants of 0.21 ± 0.005 s–1 and 0.015 ± 0.0007 s–1. These did not vary with NADPH concentration and were possibly due to damaged enzyme. This damage might be due to the oxidation of enzyme thiols; the slower phases of enzyme prepared without DTT became more prominent as these preparations aged. A weak, broad charge-transfer absorbance, observed at 580 nm, corresponded to an NADP-reduced flavin charge-transfer complex seen in many NAD(P)-dependent flavoenzymes (19Palfey B.A. Massey V. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis, volume III/Radical Reactions and Oxidation/Reduction.(Sinnott, M., ed) pp. Academic Press, New York. 1998; 236: 83-154Google Scholar). A trace at 580 nm was fit to two exponentials by fixing the rate constant for the formation of the charge-transfer absorbance to 2.5 s–1, the rate constant of flavin reduction. A rate constant of 2.29 ± 0.01 s–1 for the second phase was obtained. This could be the rate constant for NADP dissociation from the reduced enzyme, if the equilibrium lies completely toward dissociated reduced enzyme and product, but our data do not directly address this. In a separate experiment, the rate constants for flavin reduction were also measured using [4R-2H]NADPH and NADPH giving 0.42 ± .05 s–1 and 1.47 ± 0.3 s–1, respectively. A kinetic isotope effect value of 3.5 ± 0.2 was calculated, indicating that hydride transfer is at least partly rate-limiting. The reductive half-reaction of the C117A mutant of DUS 2 was studied in the same way. Traces were fit to three exponentials. A first phase (12.7 ± 2 s–1) corresponded to a small initial absorbance decrease independent of NADPH concentration. This was followed by a second phase, which accounted for the majority of the absorbance decrease, giving a reduction rate constant of 5.55 ± 0.01 s–1 and a KD of 53 ± 3 μm. A band was seen at 675 nm corresponding to an NADP-reduced flavin charge-transfer complex. A trace at 675 nm was fit to two exponentials by fixing the rate constant for the formation of the charge-transfer absorbance to 5.55 s–1, giving the rate constant for the second phase of 7 ± 2 s–1, and likely corresponds to the rate constant for NADP dissociation from the reduced enzyme. A general mechanism for the oxidative half-reaction is seen in Fig. 1. The reduced enzyme first binds to tRNA. A specific uracil in the tRNA is then reduced by the enzyme to dihydrouracil. Finally the reduced tRNA leaves the enzyme, completing the oxidative half-reaction. We investigated the oxidative half-reaction of S. cerevisiae DUS 2 using synthetic pre-tRNALeu, which was reported to be a substrate (8Xing F. Hiley S.L. Hughes T.R. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 17850-17860Google Scholar). The oxidative half-reaction was analyzed by mixing 60 μm reduced enzyme at 25 °C with saturating concentrations of synthetic yeast pre-tRNALeu (700 μm). Surprisingly, the reaction was extremely slow. Spectra were recorded over 16 h as the flavin was oxidized. Reaction traces at 457 nm fit to one exponential yielding a rate constant of 3.5 × 10–5 ± 4 × 10–7 s–1 for oxidation (Fig. 3). Product analysis showed that 0.9 ± 0.08 mol of dihydrouridine was formed per mole of flavin oxidized. The same experiment, carried out with the C117A mutant enzyme, gave a similar rate constant for flavin oxidation, 4.8 × 10–5 ± 3 × 10–7 s–1. The ratio of dihydrouridine produced per flavin molecule oxidized was 0.84 ± 0.1. The very slow reaction of the pre-tRNALeu could conceivably be caused by the intron, which is excised during normal maturation. Therefore, the oxidative half-reaction was performed using synthetic tRNALeu without the intron. Reduction of the intronless RNA was faster by a factor of ∼6, with a rate constant of 2.2 × 10–4 ± 5 × 10–6 s–1, still a very slow reaction. Given these slow reaction rates, as well as slow steady-state turnover numbers previously reported (8Xing F. Hiley S.L. Hughes T.R. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 17850-17860Google Scholar), we hypothesized that there are other factors affecting the reaction of DUS 2 with tRNA. One possibility is that in vitro transcribed tRNA is not the native DUS 2 substrate. During processing there are multiple modifications of tRNA, and it has been shown that some modification enzymes are dependent upon prior post-transcriptional modifications (20Shigi N. Suzuki T. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 2104-2113Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to determine if one or more other modifications of the tRNA was necessary for rapid reaction. To accomplish this we purified a single tRNALeu species from a DUS 2 knockout strain using an oligonucleotide affinity column. This allowed us to purify tRNA, which should have all the modifications normally present in the tRNA not dependent on the reduction step DUS 2 performs. This partially matured tRNA was reduced by DUS 2 dramatically faster than synthetic tRNA. Reduced DUS 2 (20 μm) was oxidized at 4 °C by mixing with various concentrations of the modified tRNALeu lacking dihydrouridine in anaerobic stopped flow experiments. The absorbance increases at 450 nm were fit to single exponentials. The observed rate constants did not vary with tRNA concentration, indicating a KD much lower than 20 μm (Fig. 4), in stark contrast to synthetic tRNA. The observed rate constant for reaction of the modified tRNALeu substrate was 0.14 ± 0.03 s–1, >600-fold faster than the reaction of the in vitro transcribed intronless substrate at 25 °C. Because the reduction was saturated at all accessible tRNA concentrations, it was not possible to detect whether, as tRNA concentration approaches zero, there was a finite intercept for the observed rate constant; this value would be the rate constant for the reverse of flavin oxidation. The saturating value of the observed rate constant (obtained at all concentrations) is the sum of the forward and reverse rate constants (18Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem... 1975; 250: 4048-4052Google Scholar), but it is not yet possible to parse the contributions of each. Nonetheless, the fast reaction and tight binding indicate that at least one prior modification of the tRNA is very important for substrate recognition by the enzyme. The same experiment was carried out using the C117A mutant of DUS 2. Reduced enzyme (15 μm) was mixed with 50 μm and 100 μm of partially matured tRNA in anaerobic cuvettes at 25 °C. Both reactions gave the same observed rate constant, indicating saturation with tRNA. The reaction was very slow; spectra were taken over several hours. The increase in absorbance at 450 nm with time (Fig. 5), was fit to an exponential, giving a rate constant of 8.7 × 10–5 s–1 ± 3 × 10–6 s–1, 1600-fold slower than the wild-type despite the 21° higher reaction temperature. This indicates that Cys-117 is very important for the reduction of tRNA, consistent with its proposed role as an active site acid. Interestingly, the rate constant is only enhanced 2-fold over that obtained with the in vitro transcribed pre-tRNALeu and is ∼2.5-fold slower than the intronless tRNA. This may indicate that the reason for the slow reaction rate in the in vitro transcribed substrate is improper positioning of the tRNA relative to Cys-117. The importance of modifications in increasing the affinity of tRNA was corroborated by an observation from the purification of DUS 2 by affinity chromatography. The enzyme expressed in E. coli, purified by metal affinity chromatography, gave a single protein band on an SDS-PAGE. The absorbance spectrum of this preparation had peaks characteristic of a flavoenzyme at 370 nm and 450 nm, but also had a peak at 340 nm. This unusual chromophore was separated from the enzyme either by DEAE chromatography or by phenol-chloroform extraction. The compound isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction has the spectrum of a nucleic acid, with absorbance maxima at 260 nm and also at 340 nm, where 4-thiouridine absorbs. 4-Thiouridine is a minor constituent of tRNAs, indicating that tRNA is tightly bound to both the wild-type and C117A enzymes when purified by metal affinity chromatography. Similar results were obtained with the dihydrouridine synthase from T. maritima, and a chemical analysis in that case confirmed the presence of 4-thiouridine. 4L. W. Rider, M. B. Ottosen, S. G.

The membrane-embedded SecYEG heterotrimer, also called core translocon or SecY complex, is a conserved protein-conducting channel essential for the biogenesis of most of the secretory and integral membrane proteins (1Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2007; 450: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The SecY complex is a passive conduit and thus cooperates with cytosolic and membranous partners to drive efficient polypeptide transport into and across membrane. During co-translational transport, the SecY complex associates with the ribosome and elements of the signal recognition particle (2Menetret J.F. Hegde R.S. Aguiar M. Gygi S.P. Park E. Rapoport T.A.

Syd is a nonessential and hydrophilic protein of 181 amino acid residues. Ito and co-workers (12Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Matsuo E. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) originally identified its gene as a multicopy suppressor of the dominant-negative secY-d1 mutation (and thus termed Syd for suppressor of SecYdominance). Biochemical analysis then provided the first but indirect evidence for an interaction between Syd and the translocon (14Matsuo E. Mori H. Shimoike T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18835-18840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For example, Syd was shown to interfere with protein translocation, but only in cells in which SecY and SecE proteins interact weakly. The physiological role of Syd remains uncertain (the deletion of the gene causes no obvious phenotype, see Ref. 12Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but it is anticipated that Syd should provide new clues about the nature of SecY interactions with its cytosolic partners. We here report the crystal structure of Syd and provide direct evidence for its interaction with the SecY complex. We also chart the association and investigate the consequence of Syd binding on both activity and stability of the SecY channel. This comprehensive analysis provides a new framework for the understanding of the SecY channel interactome. Plasmids and Biological Reagents-The Syd open reading frame was PCR-amplified from the Escherichia coli genome and cloned into the expression vector pET23a (Clontech) using the restriction sites NdeI and XhoI. The plasmid pBAD22-hisEYG and purification of the SecY complex were previously described (15Collinson I. Breyton C. Duong F. Tziatzios C. Schubert D. Or E. Rapoport T. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2462-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The deletion Δ251–258 and Δ354–357 into SecY and Δ7–67 into SecE was obtained by PCR amplification using primers introducing a BglII restriction site on each side of the deletion. Purification of Syd-Plasmid pET23-Syd was transformed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Overproduction of Syd was initiated at A600 nm ∼ 0.5 with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were collected in TSG buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; 50 mm NaCl; 10% glycerol; no DTT 4The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; DDM, dodecyl maltoside; IMVs, inner membrane vesicles; TMS, transmembrane segment. ) and lysed with a French press (8,000 p.s.i., three passes). After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h at 4 °C), the supernatant was applied onto a Ni2+-chelated Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in TSG buffer. Syd was eluted with 500 mm imidazole and applied onto a 5-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in TS buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; 50 mm NaCl; 1 mm DTT). Syd was eluted with 250 mm NaCl and concentrated to 40 mg/ml using an Amicon 5-kDa centrifugation device. For selenomethionine labeling, cells were grown in 9 liters of M9 media. At A600 ∼ 0.3, amino acids were added (l-lysine, l-phenylalanine, l-threonine, l-isoleucine, l-leucine, l-valine, and l-selenomethionine; each 50 mg/liter), and Syd expression was induced with 1.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside during 16 h at 30 °C. 125I labeling was performed using IODO-GEN-coated tubes (Pierce) containing 60 μg of Syd and 25 μCi of Na125I. The reaction was quenched with 5 mm DTT, and the protein was desalted through a G-25 spin column equilibrated in TSG buffer. 125I-Syd (∼2 × 105 cpm/μg) was stored at -80 °C and used within a month. Crystallization and Structure Determination-Native E. coli Syd was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in 0.8–1.0 m sodium citrate, 0.2 m sodium chloride, and 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.0. The starting protein concentration was 20 mg/ml. Crystals reached dimensions of up to 0.45 × 0.40 × 0.25 mm. Selenomethionine E. coli Syd crystallized under the same conditions, although the resultant crystals were smaller (up to 0.2 × 0.18 × 0.1 mm). All crystals were cryo-cooled in the presence of 30% sodium malonate, pH 7.0, prior to x-ray data collection at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Stanford, CA). Details of data collection, processing, and structural refinement statistics are given in the supplemental material. Each dataset was integrated and scaled using the programs MOSFLM and SCALA, respectively (16Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The structure of Syd was determined by the single wavelength anomalous diffraction method. Two selenomethionine sites, one each from the two Syd molecules in the asymmetric unit, were located and refined using the program SOLVE, and phases were subsequently improved by density modification using the program RESOLVE (17Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The program ARP/WARP was used to build the initial model (18Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). The primary sequence used in structure refinement was that from GenBank™ (accession number ABE08615). The program REFMAC5 (16Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) was used to refine the initial model using the native Syd dataset. This involved iterative cycles of fitting and rebuilding using the COOT program (19Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Further structural refinement was conducted using the native Syd dataset and CNS (20Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Note that the 6-histidine tag attached to each Syd molecule in the asymmetric unit was not observed in electron density maps and therefore was not included in the structural model. Notably, the structure determination clearly indicates the presence of a disulfide bridge between cysteines 147 and 154 in Syd. These two cysteines are ideally positioned with respect to one another within the polypeptide chain fold to form this linkage. However, for one of the molecules of Syd in the asymmetric unit, there is some evidence from electron density maps that this disulfide bridge may be broken in ∼20% of the crystallized molecules. The other two cysteines present in Syd are too far removed from one another to form a disulfide bridge. Structures were visualized using PyMol (version 0.99), and electrostatic maps were obtained using the APBS plug-in (version 1.0.0). Atomic charges and radii were generated with the AMBER option at the Protein Data Bank code 2PQR on-line service. Analytical Gel Filtration-Analytical gel filtration was performed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) connected in-line to miniDAWN multiangle light scattering equipment coupled to an interferometric refractometer (Wyatt Technologies). Data analysis was recorded in real time using the ASTRA software (Wyatt Technologies). Molecular masses were calculated using the Debye fit method. Other Methods-The preparation of reagents such as Nd-SecYEG, SecA, 125I-proOmpA, and urea-stripped IMVs, as well as the conditions for in vitro translocation assays and native/blue-native gel electrophoresis were described previously (7Bessonneau P. Besson V. Collinson I. Duong F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Alami M. Dalal K. Lelj-Garolla B. Sligar S.G. Duong F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1995-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Detection of Na125I-labeled proteins and densitometry scanning were performed using a phosphorimager scanner. A Complex of SecYEG and Syd-Nanodiscs permit investigation of the biochemistry of the SecY complex, without using liposome or detergent (21Alami M. Dalal K. Lelj-Garolla B. Sligar S.G. Duong F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1995-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Each particle, also referred to as Nd-SecYEG or SecYEG-Nanodisc, is made of a single SecY complex embedded in a small patch of lipid bilayer supported by two membrane scaffold proteins. Although homogeneous and water-soluble, the Nd-SecYEG particles (∼125 kDa) appear smeared on native-PAGE (Fig. 1A). When incubated with the purified Syd protein, however, the mobility of the particles is greatly enhanced, possibly as a result of complex formation and modification of the electrophoretic characteristics. On its own, the 125I-Syd protein migrates at the bottom of the gel but dramatically shifts to the expected high molecular weight position when incubated with the Nd-SecYEG particles (Fig. 1B). When the SecY subunit carries small internal deletion in one or the other of its largest cytosolic loops, C4 and C5, respectively, the binding of Syd appears reduced (Fig. 1B). In the SecY crystal structure, these loops extend prominently from the surface of the cytoplasmic membrane and form binding sites for SecA or the ribosome (3Menetret J.F. Schaletzky J. Clemons Jr., W.M. Osborne A.R. Skanland S.S. Denison C. Gygi S.P. Kirkpatrick D.S. Park E. Ludtke S.J. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Mol.

Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 23Osborne A.R. Rapoport T.A.

Microbiol. 2008; 70: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The stability of the Nd-SecYEG-Syd complex was further assessed by ultracentrifugation. The 125I-Syd protein, which floats at the top of the sucrose gradient, sediments to a higher density in the presence of Nd-SecYEG (Fig. 1C). The sedimentation is only partial when the SecY subunit carries the internal deletion in either C4 or C5 loops (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the absence of salt in the buffer increases the stability of the SecYEG-Syd complex (Fig. 1C, bottom panel), suggesting that electrostatic forces mediate the interaction. The oligomeric state of Syd and the stoichiometry between Syd and Nd-SecYEG was assessed by analytical gel filtration. In the presence of an excess of Syd, most of the Nd-SecYEG is complexed as judged by the shift and the symmetry of the elution peak during gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2A). Multiangle light scattering analyses indicate that the purified Nd-SecYEG-Syd complex is monodisperse with a measured molecular mass of 152 kDa ±3%. On their own, the Nd-SecYEG particles and the Syd protein are also homogeneous but with a measured molecular mass of ∼126 and ∼23 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2B). Thus, the protein Syd is monomeric in solution and forms a stable 1:1 stoichiometry with the SecYEG complex. Atomic Structure of Syd-Syd was crystallized and its structure solved by single wavelength anomalous dispersion to 2.0 Å resolution (Fig. 3A). There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and their refined structures include all residues, except for the C-terminal 6-histidine tag used to purify the protein. The Syd structure is relatively compact and globular, being primarily comprised of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and two long α-helices. A space-filling representation of Syd reveals that part of this β-sheet structure forms a concave cavity (or groove) on the protein surface. Sequence alignments show that the residues forming the concave surface of this groove are highly conserved (supplemental Fig. S1). The periphery of the observed groove is made of two protruding stalks located to the N terminus (residues 30–34; 45–48) and C terminus (residues 138–143) of the protein. Examination of surface electrostatics indicates that Syd has a distinct negatively charged patch localized on the concave groove surface and its surrounding stalks (Fig. 3B). A similar electrostatic analysis of the SecY complex shows that the two SecY loops involved in the binding of Syd are electropositive, because of several conserved basic residues in those regions (Fig. 3C). These observations strongly suggest that the negatively charged groove found in Syd forms the binding site for the SecY electropositive loops. Interacting Surface between SecY and Syd and Exclusion of SecA- Single cysteine residues were introduced at different positions on the concave surface of Syd (Fig. 4A) and tested for reactivity with IMVs enriched for the SecY complex carrying the mutation M255A. The position SecY-255C is located at the tip of loop C4, and it is involved in the binding of SecA (23Osborne A.R. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2007; 129: 97-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). None of the purified Syd variants formed cysteine-linked dimer in solution (data not shown) nor cross-reacted with the wild-type IMVs (Fig. 4B, top). In contrast, a strong SecY-Syd cysteine cross-link was detected when Syd-115C was incubated with the SecY-255C IMVs (Fig. 4B). This cross-link is specific and efficient because it appeared without the addition of oxidizing agent, and it engaged most of the SecY proteins in the corresponding titration experiment (Fig. 4B, bottom). Weaker cross-links were observed when the cysteine residue was located at other positions along the groove (90, 97, and 135, respectively; Fig. 4B, top), suggesting more distant or transient interactions with the position SecY-255. Previous Scatchard analyses indicate that Syd does not interfere with the binding of SecA onto membrane-embedded SecYEG (14Matsuo E. Mori H. Shimoike T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18835-18840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We confirm here that SecA can displace Syd from the SecY complex. Indeed, the cysteine cross-link between Syd-115C and SecY-255C is almost completely abolished when the IMVs are incubated with an equimolar amount of SecA and Syd (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, when the SecYEG complex in Nanodiscs is incubated with an equimolar amount of Syd and SecA, most of the resulting complex consists of Syd only (Fig. 4D). Thus, Syd and SecA seem to possess different affinity for the SecY complex whether it is embedded in the membrane as an oligomer or integrated in Nanodiscs as a monomer. Further discussion will require knowledge of the Kd values, but the results already indicate that the binding of Syd and SecA is mutually exclusive. The conclusion is consistent with the overlap of the interaction site, along with the size consideration of SecA and Syd. Effect of Syd on Translocation Efficiency and Stability of the SecY Complex-Search of genome data banks reveals that Syd exists only in Gram-negative bacteria and solely in those where SecE is comprised of three transmembrane segments (TMS). In general, SecE contains a single TMS except in about 30% of Gram- bacteria where two additional TMS are located at the N terminus of the protein. In E. coli, the two TMS are not essential for cell viability or translocation activity but seem important for the stability of the SecY complex (25Schatz P.J. Bieker K.L. Ottemann K.M. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Nishiyama K. Suzuki H. Tokuda H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 2121-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). The SecE subunit is indeed critical for the biogenesis of SecY, and any unassembled SecY is rapidly eliminated by the Fts protease (27Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The possible evolutive relationship between Syd and SecE prompted us to test the effect of Syd when the two TMS of SecE are deleted from the SecY complex (deletion SecEΔ7–67). As reported previously, in vitro protein translocation into wild-type IMVs is not appreciably affected by Syd (14Matsuo E. Mori H. Shimoike T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18835-18840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the concentration of Syd required to achieve half-inhibition of translocation appears ∼5 times lower for the mutant SecY complex carrying the deletion SecEΔ7–67 (Fig. 5B). A similar inhibition of translocation is also observed when the SecY complex carries the mutation G240D (or SecY24) (14Matsuo E. Mori H. Shimoike T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18835-18840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mutation G240D is located at the interface between SecY and SecE, and it reduces the stability of the SecYE complex (10Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 28Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Together, the observations suggest a relationship between the activity of Syd and the strength of the SecYEG heterotrimeric associations. Syd seems to preferentially recognize mis-assembled SecYEG complexes. In the membrane, the two TMS of SecE stabilize the SecY complex and may also prevent the binding of Syd. We thus analyzed further the effect of Syd on the stability of the SecY complex in solution. The SecY complex in DDM migrates as a dimer during Blue-Native PAGE analysis; the ratio with monomers depending on the concentration of detergent (7Bessonneau P. Besson V. Collinson I. Duong F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of Syd, the equilibrium is shifted, and most of the SecYEG dimers are dissociated in monomers (Fig. 6A). In other detergents such as Triton X-100, the SecY dimer is relatively labile and easily dissociates in single subunits (29Maillard A.P. Lalani S. Silva F. Belin D. Duong F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1281-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the presence of Syd, the dissociation of the SecY complex is further enhanced (Fig. 6A). Thus, the SecYEG associations are weakened in detergent micelles, and Syd contributes to their further destabilization. These observations are consistent with a model in which Syd acts against a translocation channel in which the SecY-SecE interactions are mal-formed, unstable, or compromised (14Matsuo E. Mori H. Shimoike T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18835-18840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the effects observed are proportional to the concentration of Syd, we failed to detect the presence of this protein in the complexes revealed by Blue-Native PAGE (Fig. 6A), suggesting weaker interaction in detergent solution or the disruption of this interaction by the charged blue dye during the gel electrophoresis. To differentiate the two possibilities, the SecYEG complex was incubated with Syd in detergent solution and analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. In the DDM micelles, the SecYEG complex and Syd are co-eluted together in a seemingly stoichiometric ratio, whereas excess of Syd is eluted in the later fractions (Fig. 6B). In the Triton X-100 micelles, SecY and Syd are also co-eluted together, but the SecE/SecG proteins clearly appear in the later fractions (Fig. 6B). Thus, Syd and the SecY subunit alone have the capacity to form a stable complex, as seen in detergent solution. Concluding Remarks-Syd is a monomeric and hydrophilic protein, with a conserved electronegative and concave surface. The simplicity of the protein makes its interaction with the SecY channel straightforward in comparison with SecA or the ribosome, both of which include multiple and complex functional domains. For all three partners however, the nature of all interactions with the SecY cytosolic loops may largely involve electrostatics. This is likely the case with Syd. In the case of the ribosome, cryo-electron microscopy studies indicate that the acidic phosphate backbone of the rRNA helices at the ribosome exit tunnel is establishing major contact points with the basic residues in the SecY loops (2Menetret J.F.

Cell. 2007; 28: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the case of SecA, the exact binding mode needs to be clarified, but one of the few electronegative patches at the surface of the protein would be prime candidate for the interaction. The capacity of Syd to dissociate the dimeric and intramolecular SecYEG associations in detergent solution is remarkable. It is consistent with the Syd inhibitory activity against certain SecY mutant complexes presenting abnormal SecY-SecE associations (Refs. 12Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Matsuo E. Mori H. Shimoike T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18835-18840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and this study). Together the results support a model in which Syd represents a quality control system for the correct assembly of the SecY channel. In the cell membrane, the mal-associated SecY complex would be preferentially recognized and further dissociated upon binding of Syd. The unassembled SecY subunit would then be targeted for degradation by the FtsH protease (27Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The Syd protein possesses an unprecedented mode of action, contributing to an additional level of sophistication to the biogenesis and the function of the translocon."
https://openalex.org/W2049299262,"Very little is known about the residues important for the interaction of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) with the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF-1R) and the insulin receptor (IR). Insulin, to which IGF-II is homologous, is proposed to cross-link opposite halves of the IR dimer through two receptor binding surfaces, site 1 and site 2. In the present study we have analyzed the contribution of IGF-II residues equivalent to insulin's two binding surfaces toward the interaction of IGF-II with the IGF-1R and IR. Four “site 1” and six “site 2” analogues were produced and analyzed in terms of IGF-1R and IR binding and activation. The results show that Val43, Phe28, and Val14 (equivalent to site 1) are critical to IGF-1R and IR binding, whereas mutation to alanine of Gln18 affects only IGF-1R and not IR binding. Alanine substitutions at Glu12, Asp15, Phe19, Leu53, and Glu57 analogues resulted in significant (>2-fold) decreases in affinity for both the IGF-1R and IR. Furthermore, taking a novel approach using a monomeric, single-chain minimized IGF-1R we have defined a distinct second binding surface formed by Glu12, Phe19, Leu53, and Glu57 that potentially engages the IGF-1R at one or more of the FnIII domains.

Its 67 amino acids are arranged, like those counterparts in IGF-I, in four domains in the order B, C, A, and D from the N terminus (Fig. 1). IGF-II and -I share >60% sequence identity across these domains, whereas their B and A domains are homologous to the B and A chains of insulin (1Denley A. Cosgrove L.J. Booker G.W. Wallace J.C.

A central B domain α-helix (Gly12–Cys21 in IGF-II) and two smaller anti-parallel α-helices in the A domain (Glu44–Arg49 and Leu53–Tyr59 in IGF-II) are the key structural features of these proteins; the α-helical segments are stabilized by three strictly conserved disulfide bonds (2Rinderknecht E.

The mitogenic and metabolic activities of the IGFs and insulin result from their interaction with the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF-1R) and/or the exon 11- (IR-A) and exon 11+ (IR-B) isoforms of the insulin receptor (IR). These class II receptor tyrosine kinases exist at the membrane as preformed disulfide-linked homodimers composed of two α and two β subunits in a β-α-α-β arrangement (reviewed in Refs. 9De Meyts P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 376-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Cell Mol.

The IR and IGF-1R share between 41 and 84% sequence similarity that is most pronounced in their tyrosine kinase domains. Despite the homology in sequence and structure between these receptors, each exhibits distinct ligand binding preferences. The IGF-1R and IR bind their cognate ligands with high affinity (IGF-I and insulin, respectively). Both the IGF-1R and IR-A bind IGF-II with high affinity and are capable of mediating IGF-II action (12Denley A. Wallace J.C. Cosgrove L.J. Forbes B.E. Horm. Metab. Res. 2003; 35: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the IR-B has a low affinity for IGF-II. The discerning factors for this isoform discrimination are largely undefined but may involve steric hindrance between the 12 amino acids encoded by exon 11 of IR-B and the IGF-II C domain. There are currently no structures of any of these ligand·receptor complexes. The binding of insulin to the IR is certainly the best characterized of these interactions. Insulin has two IR binding surfaces: the “site 1” binding surface lies within the insulin dimerization surface, whereas “site 2” overlaps its hexamer-forming surface. Insulin is proposed to cross-link opposite halves of the insulin receptor dimer through these two receptor binding surfaces (13De Meyts P. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of binding at physiological insulin concentrations is 1:1. However, each IR has two potential ligand binding pockets both also consisting of two ligand binding surfaces (site 1 and site 2 of one monomer and site 1′ and site 2′ of the other, which combine to give two identical binding pockets, site 1/2′ and site 1′/2). This putative arrangement is consistent with the three-dimensional crystal structure of the IR ectodomain (15McKern N.M. Lawrence M.C. Streltsov V.A. Lou M.-Z. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Richards K.M. Bentley J.D. Pilling P.A. Hoyne P.A. Cartledge K.A. Pham T.M. Lewis J.L. Sankovich S.E. Stoichevska V. Da Silva E. Robinson C.P. Frenkel M.J. Sparrow L.G. Fernley R.T. Epa V.C. Ward C.W. Nature. 2006; 443: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Evidence from ligand binding studies suggests that insulin may cross-link only one pair of binding surfaces at a time, with binding of a second molecule to an unoccupied site accelerating the dissociation of the first in a negatively cooperative fashion (9De Meyts P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 376-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Site 1 on the IR is proposed to contain ligand binding determinants from the L1 and FnIII-2 insert domains (probably operating in trans between opposing monomers); site 2, though less well defined, is proposed to involve loops at the junction of the FnIII-1 and FnIII-2 domains (9De Meyts P.

The interaction of IGF-I with the IGF-1R uses a similar binding mechanism to the insulin-IR interaction, with equivalent binding surfaces on the ligands and receptors (1Denley A. Cosgrove L.J.

An additional interaction of the IGF-I C domain with the cysteine rich (CR) domain of IGF-1R contributes to high affinity binding (20Whittaker J. Groth A.V. Mynarcik D.C. Pluzek L. Gadsboll V.L. Whittaker L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43980-43986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast to our knowledge of IGF-I and insulin receptor interactions there is relatively little known about the interaction of IGF-II with the IGF-1R and IR. Sequence and structural similarities suggest that IGF-II shares similar IR and IGF-1R binding surfaces (and similar modes of binding) to insulin and IGF-I. Three IGF-II residues that correspond to insulin's site 1 binding surface, i.e. Val43 (ValA3), Phe26 (PheB24), and Tyr27 (PheB25) (insulin homologues in parentheses) have previously been shown to be important for IR and IGF-1R binding (23Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IGF-II C domain is largely responsible for the differences in specificity between IGF-I and IGF-II for the IR and IGF-1R (24Denley A. Bonython E.R. Booker G.W. Cosgrove L.J. Forbes B.E. Ward C.W. Wallace J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), although, unlike the IGF-I C domain, alanine scanning mutagenesis of the IGF-1R and IR suggests it does not contact the CR domain of either receptor (21Whittaker J.

This has allowed the first comprehensive comparison of the receptor binding surfaces of IGF-II, IGF-I, and insulin. Furthermore, we have taken a novel approach using a minimized IGF-1R (see supplemental Fig. S1) to define two receptor binding surfaces on IGF-II. This has allowed us to identify subtle differences between the ligand binding surfaces of all three ligands, which could contribute toward receptor binding specificity. In addition we have investigated the possible contribution of the IGF-1R FnIII domains to IGF-II binding.

Approximately 500,000 fluorescent counts of Eu-IGF-II (IGF-1R and IR-A binding) or Eu-insulin (for IR-B binding) were added to each well along with increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor in a final volume of 100 μl and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C.

Time-resolved fluorescence was measured using 340 nm excitation and 612 nm emission filters with a BMG Lab Technologies Polarstar fluorometer (Mornington, Australia). Assays were performed in triplicate at least three times. Mini-IGF-1R Binding Assays-To construct an expression vector for the mini-IGF-1R (L1, CR, and L2 domains fused to the CTa peptide, residues 692–706, see supplemental Fig. S1) an oligonucleotide cassette encoding the CTa peptide preceded by an in-frame BamHI site and followed by a stop codon and an XbaI site was ligated into the BamHI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1zeo(+) (Invitrogen). An in-frame BamHI site was introduced into the IGF-1R cDNA after the codon for Asp461, the C terminus of the IGF-1R L2 domain, by site-directed mutagenesis (32Kirsch R.D. Joly E.

Cells were pelleted at 1025 × g for 1.5 min, and the supernatant was aspirated. Cells were washed with 500 μl of cold TBS and pelleted, and the supernatant was aspirated again. Pellets were incubated with Enhancement solution (100 μl) in the dark for 30 min and then transferred to a white Greiner Lumitrac 600 96-well plate. Time-resolved fluorescence was measured as described above. Assays were performed in triplicate at least three times.

Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, the plates were washed three times with TBST. Phosphorylated receptor was detected by incubation at room temperature for 2 h with europium-labeled antiphosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (76 ng/well, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Wells were washed four times with TBST, twice with water, and then DELFIA enhancement solution (100 μl/well) was added. Time-resolved fluorescence was detected as described above. Assays were performed in triplicate at least three times. Production and Characterization of IGF-II Analogues-To define and compare the receptor binding surfaces of IGF-II with those of insulin, two groups of IGF-II analogues were produced (Fig. 1). The site 1 analogues, Val14 → Thr, Gln18 → Ala, Phe28 → Leu, and Val43 → Met IGF-II, are so called because they incorporate amino acid substitutions at residues corresponding to insulin's site 1 binding surface (ValB12, TyrB16, TyrB26, and ValA3 in insulin, respectively). The site 2 analogues contain alanine substitutions at the residues Glu12, Asp15, Phe19, Asp52, Leu53, and Glu57, which correspond to insulin's second binding surface (HisB10, GluB13, LeuB17, SerA12, LeuA13, and GluA17, respectively). Following successful expression in E. coli, analogues were purified, and their structural integrity was analyzed by far-UV CD spectroscopy. All analogues had CD spectra indistinguishable from that of IGF-II (29Delaine C. Alvino C.L. McNeil K.A. Mulhern T.D. Gauguin L. De Meyts P. Jones E.Y. Brown J. Wallace J.C. Forbes B.E. J. Biol.

IGF-1R Binding Properties of IGF-II Analogues-Competition binding assays were used to measure the affinities of IGF-II and IGF-II analogues for IGF-1R immunocaptured from P6 IGF-1R cell lysates (Fig. 2, A and B) and for IGF-1R present on P6 IGF-1R cells (Fig. 2, C and D), because there is evidence that some analogues behave differently in the two assay formats (34Gauguin L.

Agrin is a proteoglycan with a molecular mass of more than 500 kDa that is expressed in many tissues (for a review, see Ref. 1Bezakova G. Ruegg M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Despite its widespread expression, the function of agrin is best characterized in skeletal muscle, where it is a key organizer during formation, maintenance, and regeneration of the neuromuscular junction (2Sanes J.R.

Accordingly, mice with an inactivation of the agrn gene die at birth due to nonfunctional neuromuscular junctions and subsequent respiratory failure (4Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Moscoso L. Rupp F.

Little is known about the role of agrin in other tissues, in particular in the central nervous system (for a review, see Ref. 5Kröger S. Schröder J.E. News Physiol.

Likewise, brains of agrin-deficient mice, whose perinatal death was prevented by the reexpression of agrin specifically in motor neurons, have a severely reduced number of pre- and postsynaptic specializations at excitatory synapses (10Ksiazek I.

In addition, agrin isoforms are highly expressed by central nervous system neurons before synapse formation, suggesting additional functions for agrin during axonal and dendritic elongation (11Kröger S.

Alternative first exon usage generates either a secreted soluble agrin molecule (NtA-agrin) or a transmembrane form of agrin (TM-agrin) (17Burgess R.W. Skarnes W.C. Sanes J.R. J.

Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The secreted form of agrin specifically interacts with the laminin γ1-chain via its NtA-domain, resulting in a stable association with basal laminae (19Denzer A.J. Brandenberger R. Gesemann M.

Denzer A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6762-6770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in TM-agrin, the NtA-domain is replaced by a non-cleaved signal anchor that converts agrin into a type II transmembrane protein and localizes the agrin protein in an Ncyto/Cexo orientation in the plasma membrane (17Burgess R.W. Skarnes W.C. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Neumann F.R. Bittcher G. Annies M. Schumacher B. Kröger S. Ruegg M.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). TM-agrin is primarily expressed in the CNS on axons and dendrites during the phase of active neurite extension (15Annies M. Kröger S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 20: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R. Löschinger J. Wöll S. Porten E. Abraham C. Ruegg M.A. Kröger S. Mol.

In agreement with this hypothesis, it was recently shown that either clustering or overexpression of TM-agrin in neurons during the phase of active neurite extension reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton and induces the rapid formation of numerous filopodia-like processes extending from the primary neurite (21Annies M.

In this study, we demonstrate that the TM-agrin-mediated formation of processes is the result of the initiation of an intracellular signaling cascade, which involves lipid rafts, the activation of the Src family kinase Fyn, and the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). These results provide essential evidence for a function of TM-agrin as a receptor or co-receptor on neurites. Animals-Fertile White Leghorn (Gallus gallus domesticus) chicken eggs were purchased from a local hatchery and incubated at 38 °C in a humid atmosphere. The age of the embryos was expressed in embryonic days. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the welfare of experimental animals issued by the Federal Government of Germany and the University of Mainz. Materials-Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβC) and PDMP (dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol) were obtained from Sigma. The inhibitors PP1 and PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone) were obtained from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). PP1 and PD98059 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a concentration of 25 mg/ml, corresponding to 88 and 100 mm, respectively. The following antibodies against agrin were used: rabbit anti-agrin antiserum 46 (11Kröger S. Horton S.E. Honig L.S. J.

This antiserum was generated against the C-terminal half of agrin and, thus, specifically reacts with the extracellular part of all TM-agrin and NtA-agrin isoforms in Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. In contrast, sheep anti-TM-agrin (generated against a peptide of the intracellular domain of TM-agrin) reacts only with TM-agrin and not with NtA-agrin (21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R.

In contrast, the rabbit polyclonal antibody Src[pY418] (Invitrogen) detects specifically the tyrosine phosphate at position 418 (murine) and 417 (chick) of different Src family kinases and was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (1:1000 dilution). A rabbit antiserum against glycerinaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was from Abcam (ab9485; Cambridge, UK) (26Hambsch B. Grinevich V. Seeburg P.H. Schwarz M.K. J. Biol.

Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the transferrin receptor were from Invitrogen and used at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Polyclonal antibodies against total MAPK as well as monoclonal antibodies against phospho-MAPK were from Cell Signaling Technologies (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). Cell Culture of Retinal Ganglion Cells-TM-agrin has been shown to induce filopodia-like processes on several neurons from the central and peripheral nervous system (21Annies M. Bittcher G.

Throughout the present study, retinal ganglion cells were used, because they have been shown to exclusively synthesize TM-agrin (21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R. Löschinger J. Wöll S. Porten E. Abraham C. Ruegg M.A. Kröger S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Retinal ganglion cells were cultured as described previously (27Halfter W. Reckhaus W. Kröger S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3712-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on coverslips pretreated overnight with poly-l-lysine and subsequently coated with EHS tumor-derived laminin (Sigma) at a concentration of 2 μg/cm2 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were cultured for 1 or 2 days in vitro. Filopodia-like processes were induced by incubating with saturating amounts of the anti-agrin antiserum 46, and the number of processes was determined after the indicated time, as described previously (21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R. Löschinger J. Wöll S. Porten E. Abraham C. Ruegg M.A. Kröger S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The values were expressed as the number of processes per 50 μm of neurite length. Immunocytochemistry-Retinal neuron cultures were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1% phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Excess fixative was removed by washing the cultures twice with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by incubation with phosphate buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100. Cultures were double-labeled by first incubating with a primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by extensive washing in phosphate buffer. The cultures were subsequently incubated with the appropriate Alexa594- or Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-sheep, goat anti-mouse, or goat anti-rabbit; Molecular Probes; 24 μg/ml final concentration) and with Alexa-488-conjugated phalloidin to reveal the actin cytoskeleton or with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated cholera toxin, as described (21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R. Löschinger J. Wöll S. Porten E. Abraham C. Ruegg M.A. Kröger S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All secondary antibodies were preabsorbed against IgG of other species, eliminating cross-reactivity. After 1.5 h, the cultures were again washed in PBST and embedded in Citifluor fluorescent mounting medium (Plano, Wetzlar, Germany). Specimens were analyzed with a photomicroscope (Leica, DMRA; Leica, Solms, Germany) equipped with epifluorescence optics using fluorescence filters of the appropriate wavelength for the complete separation of the different chromophores. Pictures were acquired with a digital camera (DC200; Leica) using the Leica data acquisition software. Contrast and brightness of entire images were adjusted using Photoshop (version 7.0; Adobe, Mountain View, CA). Isolation of Lipid Rafts-Lipid rafts were prepared as described by Simons and Ikonen (28Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7940) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Retinal ganglion cells either untreated or treated with anti-agrin antibodies were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and then lysed for 1 h on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-base, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) as well as phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture 1 and 2; Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were homogenized through a 27-gauge needle and subsequently through a 22-gauge needle three times each. The lysate was then adjusted to a concentration of 40% using the OptiPrep density gradient medium according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma), loaded at the bottom of a STLS55 centrifuge tube (Beckmann Coulter, Krefeld, Germany), and overlaid with 1.2 ml of 30% OptiPrep in lysis buffer and 0.2 ml of 5% OptiPrep. The samples were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, eight fractions (0.25 ml each) were collected from top to bottom and designated as fractions 1–8. Fractions 1 and 2 (corresponding to ∼15% OptiPrep) contained Fyn and are referred to as lipid raft fractions. To concentrate the proteins, the fractions were diluted with water containing protease inhibitors and centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C and 55,000 rpm in a TLA 55 rotor. The protein pellet was then dissolved in 60 μl of SDS buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0,01% bromphenol blue) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting-Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) by electroblotting. The membranes were blocked with 4% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The dilutions of the antibody were as described above. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA) and were used at dilutions of 1:5,000. Peroxidase-associated signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (SuperSignal West Pico; Pierce, Bonn, Germany), followed by exposure to BioMax HyperFilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands in Western blots were quantified, and densitometric analysis was performed using the AIDA Image Analyzer software (version 3.28; Raytest; Straubenhardt, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Values of phosphoprotein bands were normalized to the values of the corresponding total proteins to account for loading variations and random variability in the different lanes. Mean normalized values from the indicated number of experiments were plotted and compared statistically as previously described (29White R. Gonsior C. Kramer-Albers E.M. Stohr N. Huttelmaier S. Trotter J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. for n ≥ 3. TM-agrin and Cholesterol-rich Lipid Rafts Colocalize on Neurites-Clustering of TM-agrin by polyclonal antibodies or overexpression of TM-agrin cDNA is sufficient to induce the formation of highly dynamic filopodia-like processes on axons and dendrites from central or peripheral nervous system neurons (21Annies M.

Lin L. Daniels M.P. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 33: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since similar processes can also be induced in nonneuronal cells from several species (22McCroskery S. Chaudhry A. Lin L. Daniels M.P. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 33: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), 5R. Ramseger, R. White, and S. Kröger, unpublished results. the intracellular signaling mechanism appears not to be restricted to neurons. Lipid rafts are glycosphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched microdomains within cell membranes that serve as signaling platforms in many different cell types of many different species (30Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5053) Google Scholar). To determine if lipid rafts are involved in TM-agrin-induced process formation, processes were induced on retinal ganglion cell axons and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated β-subunit of cholera toxin (Ctx). Cholera toxin binds to the ganglioside GM1, a major component of lipid rafts (31Schon A. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5019-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and has been used extensively as a lipid raft marker in a variety of cells and tissues (e.g. see Refs. 32Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar and 33Bruses J.L. Chauvet N. Rutishauser U. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 504-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retinal ganglion cells were used, since they exclusively express the transmembrane form of agrin (18Neumann F.R. Bittcher G. Annies M. Schumacher B. Kröger S. Ruegg M.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous results (34Wu C.C. Russell R.M. Karten H.J. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), Ctx-binding sites are widely present on the retinal ganglion cell axon (Fig. 1A). Moreover, Ctx-binding sites are also associated with TM-agrin-induced filopodia-like processes (Fig. 1B), and agrin immunoreactivity and Ctx-binding sites codistribute on untreated axons (Fig. 1, C–E) as well as on the filopodia-like processes (Fig. 1, F–H). The overlapping distribution of agrin immunoreactivity and Ctx binding sites is consistent with the hypothesis that TM-agrin is associated with lipid rafts. To more directly determine if TM-agrin is an integral part of lipid rafts and if anti-agrin antibody-induced clustering of TM-agrin on neurons induces a change in the lipid raft association of agrin, cold Triton X-100-insoluble components of membranes from retinal ganglion cells were isolated by discontinuous OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation, a method widely used to enrich for lipid raft components (30Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5053) Google Scholar). Eight fractions ranging from low (fraction 1) to high (fraction 8) density were obtained and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting (Fig. 2). The Src family kinase Fyn has previously been shown to be enriched in lipid rafts (35Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 36Hering H. Lin C.C. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was used as a marker for the low density fractions. The presence of Fyn in Western blots of fractions 1 and 2 indicates that these two fractions are enriched in lipid rafts (Fig. 2). In support of this notion, the transferrin receptor and glycerinaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were exclusively present in the high density nonraft fractions. In membranes from untreated control retinal ganglion cells, TM-agrin was detected in the low density lipid raft-containing fractions 1 and 2 as well as in the high density nonraft fractions (fractions 5–8; Fig. 2, left). In contrast, separation of membranes prepared 5 min after TM-agrin clustering and subsequent process formation (21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R. Löschinger J. Wöll S. Porten E. Abraham C. Ruegg M.A. Kröger S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) showed that agrin was highly concentrated in the low density lipid raft fractions, and little immunoreactivity remained in the high density nonraft fractions (Fig. 2, right). A similar result was obtained when lipid rafts were analyzed 3 h after antibody treatment (not shown), a time point where the number of processes has reached a maximum (21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R. Löschinger J. Wöll S. Porten E. Abraham C. Ruegg M.A. Kröger S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, the transferrin receptor as well as glycerinaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase remained associated exclusively with the nonraft fractions (Fig. 2, right). Although the large size of agrin and its migration as a broad smear in Western blots precluded a precise quantification, these results are consistent with the idea that TM-agrin is associated with lipid rafts and with nonraft fractions in nontreated neurons and that formation of an actin-rich filopodia-like process by clustering of TM-agrin is paralleled by the partitioning of the majority of TM-agrin into lipid rafts. To determine if lipid rafts are required for TM-agrin-mediated process induction, retinal ganglion cells were preincubated for 1 h with mβC, followed by clustering of TM-agrin to induce process formation. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin is a water-soluble cyclic oligomer that sequesters cholesterol from plasma membranes within its hydrophobic core and, thus, acutely disperses lipid rafts (30Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5053) Google Scholar, 37Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson E.M.

Weinberg R.J. Mei L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3164-3175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment for 4 h had no effect on the growth of the neurites or on growth cone morphology (data not shown), indicating that mβC does not affect retinal ganglion cell viability under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 3A, incubation of retinal ganglion cells with mβC resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the number of TM-agrin-induced processes, and at a concentration of 2 mm, the number of processes was reduced to control values. These results demonstrate that extraction of cholesterol from lipid rafts using mβC inhibits TM-agrin-dependent process formation. To obtain additional evidence for a role of lipid rafts in TM-agrin-dependent process formation, the synthesis of lipid rafts was inhibited using threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP). PDMP inhibits the biosyntheses of glycosphingolipids, key components of lipid rafts, and thus reduces the number of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane by a different mechanism compared with mβC (39Inokuchi J. Mason I. Radin N.S. Cancer Lett. 1987; 38: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40Nagafuku M. Kabayama K. Oka D. Kato A. Tani-ichi S. Shimada Y. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Yamasaki S. Saito T. Iwabuchi K. Hamaoka T. Inokuchi J. Kosugi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51920-51927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Preincubation of retinal ganglion cells with PDMP for 24 h did not influence their viability or growth cone morphology (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 3B, treatment of retinal ganglion cells with PDMP reduced the number of TM-agrin-induced processes. This reduction was dose-dependent, and values similar to nontreated control cultures were reached at a concentration of 40 μm PDMP. In summary, our results show that TM-agrin is associated with lipid rafts and that lipid rafts are required for the TM-agrin-dependent formation of filopodia-like processes. To analyze the role of lipid rafts in the maintenance of TM-agrin-induced processes, neurites were pretreated with anti-agrin antibodies for 3 h to induce the maximal number of filopodia-like processes and then incubated for 1.5 h with increasing concentrations of mβC to disperse lipid rafts. In the absence of mβC but continuous presence of anti-agrin antibodies, the number of processes was not changed compared with the initial number of processes (bar ab + 0 mm in Fig. 3C), in agreement with the previous observation that extended incubation times with antibodies does not lead to the formation of more processes (21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R. Löschinger J. Wöll S. Porten E. Abraham C. Ruegg M.A. Kröger S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Likewise, removal of the antibodies in the absence of mβC did not affect the number or stability of the process (bar ab in Fig. 3C; see also Ref. 21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R. Löschinger J. Wöll S. Porten E. Abraham C. Ruegg M.A. Kröger S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, incubation of process-containing retinal ganglion cells with either 2 or 5 mm mβC for 1.5 h in the presence of anti-agrin antibodies resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the number of processes (Fig. 3C). These data show that extraction of cholesterol from lipid rafts eliminates existing TM-agrin-induced processes, demonstrating that rafts are not only required for the initial formation of TM-agrin-induced processes but also for their"

KatG enzymes are homologous to class I peroxidases such as cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase (5Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999: 276-278Google Scholar), although certain features clearly distinguish the KatG enzymes. The most unusual of these is a three-amino acid distal side adduct (MYW) in which the side chains of Met255, Tyr229, and Trp107 are covalently linked. This adduct (Fig. 1) is found in all KatG enzymes (6Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Bertrand T.

The details of post-translational modification and the exact role of the MYW adduct in the catalase reaction mechanism remain under active investigation. Our companion paper (52Suarez J.

The origin of the changes in catalatic function in Synechocystis KatG and Burkholderia pseudomallei KatG distal Trp mutants had been assigned to faulty binding of the second molecule of hydrogen peroxide that should participate in reduction of Compound (Cmpd) I in a classical catalase cycle (12Regelsberger G.

Loboda A. Zhang H. Mauk A.G. Loewen P.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5868-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), because the formation of Cmpd I was undamaged and in fact was very rapid in those cases. More recently, residue Trp111 together with His112 were described as key sites in Synechocystis KatG for the steering of Cmpd I reduction by hydrogen peroxide (16Deemagarn T. Wiseman B. Carpena X. Ivancich A. Fita I. Loewen P.C. Proteins. 2007; 66: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mutations in other residues surrounding the heme pocket have also been shown to interfere with catalase activity for reasons ascribed to disruption of hydrogen bonding networks (17Jakopitsch C.

Other issues such as stabilization of the oxyferrous heme intermediate formed in the presence of excess H2O2 was not presented in studies of KatG from other laboratories, but in the case of M. tuberculosis KatG[Y229F] (14Yu S. Girotto S. Zhao X. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44121-44127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and in KatG[W107F] as shown here, such stabilization is clearly a fundamental alteration in function that sets apart the behavior of these mutants. No prior work has defined a specific mechanistic role for the MYW adduct structure that could not also be fulfilled by the individual residues whether they were covalently linked or not. DFT calculations along with extensive analysis of EPR spectra allowed a reasonable assignment in the companion paper (52Suarez J. Ranguelova K. Jarzecki A.A. Manzerova J. Krymov V. Zhao X. Yu S.

The formation of this species occurs in KatG[Y229F], W107F, and M255A mutants in the presence of even a few molar equivalents of peroxide, but catalase function is severely reduced. The properties of the oxy intermediates in WT KatG and three distal side mutants and a proposed mechanism for the catalase reaction are discussed here. Chemicals and Reagents-INH, PAA, hydrogen peroxide, o-dianisidine, and all the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest purity available. INH was recrystallized from methanol and stored at 4 °C. PAA (32%) was diluted to 10 mm in potassium phosphate buffer and was incubated with 780 units/ml catalase (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 37 °C, followed by removal of the enzyme by ultrafiltration, to remove hydrogen peroxide that interfered with optical stopped-flow experiments. This preparation of PAA was stored at -80 °C in small aliquots.

Optical Measurements-All standard spectrophotometric measurements were performed using an NT14 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Aviv Biomedical, Lakewood, NJ).

Catalase and peroxidase activities were determined spectrophotometrically in replicate analyses using initial rates of reactions with 25 mm hydrogen peroxide (catalase activity) or t-butyl hydroperoxide plus o-dianisidine (peroxidase activity) according to published methods (22Marcinkeviciene J.A.

A rapid scanning diode array stopped-flow spectrophotometer (HiTech Scientific model SF-61DX2) was used for kinetics experiments. Data acquisition and analyses were performed using the Kinet-Asyst software package (HiTech Scientific). All reactions were followed at 25 °C using freshly prepared solutions of PAA or H2O2, all in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Preparation of Oxyferrous KatG[W107F]-Oxyferrous KatG[W107F] was generated through photolysis of the carbonyl enzyme dissolved in oxygen-containing buffer as described by Miller et al. (24Miller M.A. Bandyopadhyay D. Mauro J.M. Traylor T.G. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2789-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme solutions were placed in a sealed cuvette and purged with argon for 30 min followed by carbon monoxide for 10 min. Addition of a small excess of sodium dithionite resulted in conversion to the enzyme-CO complex according to the optical features of the product (the wavelengths of the Soret, β, and α bands were 422, 540, 570 nm, respectively). The enzyme-CO complex was then separated in air from the reaction mixture using a small ion exchange column. After extensive rinsing of the bound enzyme-CO complex, it was eluted with potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl. The chromatographic purification procedure was performed in a cold room with reduced light and completed within 10 min to minimize dissociation of CO by photolysis. The enzyme-CO complex was then subjected to a 10–15-s illumination by a 75-watt xenon lamp, and the resulting protein was stored at 4 °C. For comparison, similar experiments were performed using WT KatG. In some cases, the oxyenzyme complexes were also prepared by treating the ferric enzymes with excess H2O2 followed by rapid removal of excess peroxide through ion exchange chromatography of the enzyme. EPR/Resonance Raman Spectroscopy-X-band EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker E500 EPR spectrometer with data acquisition and manipulation performed using XeprView and WinEPR software (Bruker). Low temperature spectra were recorded using an Oxford Spectrostat continuous flow cryostat and ITC503 temperature controller. The spectra of KatG[W107F] (100 μm) were recorded at 10 K in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (at room temperature). The EPR spectrum of commercial ferric horse heart Mb in 50 mm glycine/NaOH buffer at pH 10 was used as a standard to estimate the low spin concentration in samples of KatG[W107F]. Final heme concentration in the standard was based on the Soret peak at 418 nm, assuming complete conversion to the low spin alkaline form of myoglobin (∈ = 95 mm-1·cm-1) (25Antonini E. Brunori M.

Resonance Raman spectra were obtained using instrumentation described previously (27Kapetanaki S. Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. Schelvis J.P.

The laser power at the sample was 10 milliwatts. Toluene was used to calibrate the spectra, and the spectra were corrected for a sloping base line with a polynomial function. The goal of this work was to provide characterization of resting KatG[W107F] and new mechanistic insights into the loss of catalase activity in this and two other distal side mutants to shed light on the mechanism in the WT enzyme. Spectroscopic examination of the ferric enzyme helps explain the major alteration in functional properties of the W107F mutant, which include stabilization of 6-c heme species.

Here, changes in mechanism and the properties of heme and enzyme intermediates are described in the context of the unique mechanistic features afforded by the distal side MYW adduct presented in the companion paper (52Suarez J. Ranguelova K. Jarzecki A.A. Manzerova J. Krymov V. Zhao X. Yu S. Metlitsky L. Gerfen G.J. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol.

Enzymatic and Spectroscopic Characterization of KatG[W107F]- The yield of KatG[W107F] upon overexpression and purification from Escherichia coli is similar to that of WT KatG. The catalase activity of KatG[W107F] is greatly reduced compared with WT KatG (0.5 ± 0.2 versus 3800 ± 300 units/mg for WT KatG) under assay conditions using millimolar concentrations of H2O2, whereas its peroxidase activity (with t-butyl peroxide and o-dianisidine) is only moderately reduced (0.6 ± 0.2 versus 0.9 ± 0.1 unit/mg for WT KatG). Here, it was considered important to describe the characteristics of the resting (ferric) enzyme to help explain the behavior of the oxyenzyme presented below. The optical spectrum of KatG[W107F] has a Soret peak at 407 and sharp CT2 and CT1 bands around 504 and 628 nm, respectively (Fig. 2A), characteristic of enzyme containing a high level of 6-c heme. In freshly isolated WT KatG, which contains 5-c heme as the majority species, the CT1 band is found close to 640 nm, and in “aged” WT enzyme, which contains more 6-c heme, it occurs at 629 nm (31Chouchane S. Girotto S. Kapetanaki S. Schelvis J.P. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8154-8162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the W107F mutant also exhibits optical features at 541 and 578 nm characteristic of the β and α bands of 6-c low spin (6-c LS) ferric heme and/or oxyferrous heme, both of which are confirmed here. These low spin features decay upon storage of the enzyme, consistent with loss of an exchangeable heme ligand. EPR and resonance Raman spectra also provided insight into coordination number in the W107F mutant. EPR spectra of freshly purified KatG[W107F] contain a broad axial signal (g⊥ = 5.80 and g ∼2.0) and some low intensity signals because of 6-c low spin ferric heme (g1 = 3.23, g2 = 2.05 and unresolved g3) estimated to be less than 10% of heme content in the fresh enzyme (Fig. 2B, spectrum 1). WT KatG under the same conditions instead exhibits signals assigned to 5-c heme and a rhombic signal also assigned to a 6-c heme species different from the one in the mutant (g1,2,3 = 5.94, 5.49, ∼2) (31Chouchane S.

The 6-c complexes other than the low spin species are assigned to enzyme containing water as a sixth ligand associated with heme iron. Certain similar findings were reported earlier for the analogous mutant of Synechocystis and B. pseudomallei KatG (28Carpena X. Wiseman B. Deemagarn T. Herguedas B. Ivancich A. Singh R. Loewen P.C. Fita I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5171-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Ivancich A. Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Un S. Obinger C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14093-14102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An endogenous strong field ligand is likely responsible for the 6-c LS species because the gmax value (3.21) is larger than that usually observed for O-type (oxygen and nitrogen as the strong field axial ligands) heme (33Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Arends T. Bemski G. Nagel R.L. Proceedings of the 1st Inter-American Symposium on Hemoglobins, Caracas, 1969. Karger, Basel1971: 199Google Scholar, 34Svistunenko D.A. Sharpe M.A. Nicholls P. Blenkinsop C. Davies N.A. Dunne J. Wilson M.T. Cooper C.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The hydroxy-form of horseradish peroxidase, for example, exhibits an EPR signal with gmax = 2.9 (35Blumberg W.E. Peisach J. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1854-1862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a similar signal is reported for the distal histidine (H123Q) mutant of Synechocystis KatG (32Ivancich A. Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Un S. Obinger C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14093-14102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) arguing in favor of the hydroxide form in that histidine mutant and assignment of the 6-c LS species here to an endogenous ligand complex very likely from coordination of the distal imidazole (residue His108). Resonance Raman spectra of KatG[W107F] contained multiple ν3 bands, including a 6-c heme band at 1488 cm-1 (along with a small contribution from a band at 1483 cm-1 also assigned to 6-c heme), and a band at 1507 cm-1 typical of 6-c LS heme (Fig. 2C), consistent with the optical and EPR spectra. The bands usually associated with out-of-plane modes in the low frequency region of the resonance Raman spectra have lower intensities in the mutant compared with WT M. tuberculosis KatG, suggesting a more planar geometry of heme. This observation is consistent with the axial EPR signal arising from the majority species at low temperature. An oxyenzyme component was not detectable most likely because of photolysis of the ligand. In KatG[W107F], and in KatG[Y229F] as previously reported (14Yu S. Girotto S. Zhao X. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44121-44127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), elimination of the MYW adduct apparently alters the hydrogen bonding arrangements on the distal side to favor and stabilize 6-c heme. Conversely, water coordination in WT KatG could be considered to be disfavored by the presence of the MYW adduct. The heme iron-associated water molecule in the crystal structure of WT M. tuberculosis KatG from this laboratory (36Zhao X. Yu H. Yu S. Wang F. Sacchettini J.C. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) is hydrogen bonded to the indole nitrogen of Trp107 (and is also hydrogen bonded to the distal histidyl imidazole but at a longer distance). The hydrogen bond to the indole nitrogen could disfavor optimal interaction between the water ligand and iron; in fact the water iron bond length is 2.8 Å in this structure (36Zhao X. Yu H. Yu S. Wang F. Sacchettini J.C. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The 6-c form(s) of M. tuberculosis KatG enzyme in solution displays unique spectroscopic and functional properties (37Zhao X. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Ranguelova K. Suarez J. Metlitsky L. Yu S. Brejt S.Z. Zhao L. Schelvis J.P. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 12583-12592Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because both the 107 and the 229 mutants favor 6-c heme species, the distal sides must have something in common. The phenolic oxygen of Tyr229 in the MYW adduct of WT KatG faces away from heme iron (36Zhao X. Yu H. Yu S. Wang F. Sacchettini J.C. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas the indole nitrogen of Trp107 faces toward the sixth ligand position, yet mutation of either residue has a similar effect on coordination number that could arise due to removal of the participation of the indole group. The position of the indole is likely to be altered in the Y229F mutant because of the missing covalent bond to Trp107. Thus, disruption of the indole-water interactions in these two distal side mutants can favor water coordination to iron. There may also be a change in the position of His108 because the adjacent Trp side chain is not incorporated into the MYW adduct in the Y229F mutant, and the link between Tyr229 and Trp107 is absent in the W107F mutant, such that this region of the distal pocket can be more flexible in both cases. The histidyl imidazole of residue 108 may then become the more important hydrogen-bonding site for stabilizing sixth ligands to iron. The W107F mutant also exhibits more 6-c LS heme because of coordination of an endogenous ligand likely to be the distal imidazole, which constitutes specific evidence for enhanced flexibility of the distal side in the heme pocket. Most importantly, the observation of enhanced stability of oxyferrous heme in these distal side mutants is consistent with the idea that the histidyl imidazole can better participate in hydrogen bonding to stabilize ligands when the indole of Trp107 is missing. Oxyferrous KatG[W107F]-The presence of some oxyferrous enzyme in samples of purified KatG[W107F] was suspected because of the broad shape of the features around 540 and 580 nm in the optical spectrum of the enzyme as isolated. However, oxyferrous heme has not been reported for purified KatG or other “native” peroxidases, either because there is no route to its formation in situ or because this intermediate may be formed but is unstable. Thus, the presence of oxyferrous heme in preparations of KatG[W107F] would indicate first that it can be formed during cell growth and that it is stable enough to persist during purification and storage. To help confirm these ideas, authentic oxyferrous KatG[W107F] was prepared by photolysis in aerated buffer of the carbonyl complex formed from reduced (ferrous) enzyme and CO. The prepared oxy-KatG[W107F] shows characteristic absorption bands at 413, 542, and 578 nm. Like oxy-horseradish peroxidase (39Wittenberg B.A. Antonini E. Brunori M. Noble R.W. Wittenberg J.B. Wymann J. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1970-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the oxyenzyme undergoes auto-oxidation to ferric enzyme with an isosbestic point consistent with direct conversion to the ferric enzyme (Fig. 3A). Oxyferrous KatG[W107F] decays very slowly, and the reaction follows single exponential kinetics. The t½ is estimated to be at least 2 days at 4 °C, as compared with 6 min for the similarly prepared oxy-WT KatG (Fig. 3B). In similar experiments, the half-lives of oxyferrous Y229F and M255A mutants were found to be 25 and 7 min, respectively. The oxy-WT KatG and KatG[Y229F] prepared here are more stable than the corresponding enzyme forms from Synechocystis (40Jakopitsch C. Wanasinghe A. Jantschko W. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9037-9042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the stability of oxyferrous M. tuberculosis KatG was hardly affected by the Met255 mutation, was improved by the Tyr299 mutation, and was greatly enhanced by Trp107 mutation. The Met255 mutation still allows formation of a Tyr-Trp cross-link on the distal side (10Ghiladi R.A. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15093-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These observations lead to the conclusion that the MYW adduct in WT KatG disfavors ligand binding to the sixth coordination position of heme iron in confirmation of the observations on the ferric enzyme above.

https://openalex.org/W2054460645,"CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) is a key rate-controlling enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the principle membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine. CCTalpha is the predominant isoform expressed in mammalian cells. To investigate the role of CCTalpha in the development and function of B-lymphocytes, mice with B-lymphocytes that selectively lacked CCTalpha were derived using the CD19-driven Cre/loxP system. When challenged with a T-cell-dependent antigen, the animals harboring CCTalpha-deficient B-cells exhibited a hyper-IgM secretion phenotype coupled with a lack of IgG production. The inability of CCTalpha-/- B-cells to undergo class switch recombination correlated with a proliferation defect in vivo and in vitro in response to antigenic and mitogenic stimuli. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation of CCTalpha-/- B-cells resulted in an early trigger of the unfolded protein response-mediated splicing of Xbp-1 mRNA, and this was accompanied by accelerated kinetics of IgM secretion and higher incidence of IgM-secreting cells. Thus, the inability of stimulated B-cells to produce enough phosphatidylcholine prevents proliferation and class switch recombination but leads to unfolded protein response activation and a hyper-IgM secretion phenotype."

Furthermore, deregulation of CK1delta has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In this study, the cell specific distribution of CK1delta in various tissues and organs of young adult BALB/c mice was analysed by immunohistochemistry.Immunohistochemical staining of CK1delta was performed using three different antibodies against CK1delta. A high expression of CK1delta was found in a variety of tissues and organ systems and in several cell types of endodermal, mesodermal and ectodermal origin.These results give an overview of the cell-type specific expression of CK1delta in different organs under normal conditions. Thus, they provide evidence for possible cell-type specific functions of CK1delta, where CK1delta can interact with and modulate the activity of key regulator proteins by site directed phosphorylation. Furthermore, they provide the basis for future analyses of CK1delta in these tissues."

There are two main pathways for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine: the CDP-choline pathway present in all eukaryotes and the phosphatidylethanolamine methylation pathway present in mammalian hepatocytes and some single celled eukaryotes, including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In S. cerevisiae, the rate-determining step in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine via the CDP-choline pathway is catalyzed by Pct1. Pct1 converts phosphocholine and CTP to CDP-choline and pyrophosphate. In this study, we determined that Pct1 is in the nucleoplasm and at endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes.

Exclusion of Pct1 from the nucleus by elimination of its nuclear localization signal or by decreasing Kap60 function did not affect the level of phosphatidylcholine synthesis.

In this study, we demonstrate that the karyopherin Kap60 (Srp1/importin-α) interacts with Pct1. Kap60 and Kap95 (Rsl1/importin-β) form a heterodimer that regulates protein import into the nucleus (37Cook A. Bono F. Jinek M. Conti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 38King M.C. Lusk C.P. Blobel G. Nature. 2006; 442: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 39Strahl T. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Diminution of the function of either Kap60 or Kap95 abolished Pct1 nuclear import. A bipartite basic region in Pct1 was required for Pct1 to interact with Kap60 and for its import into the nucleus. Deletion of the nuclear localization signal from Pct1 resulted in its localization to the cytoplasm but did not affect the level of PC synthesis. The rate of PC synthesis through the CDP-choline pathway was normal when Pct1 import into the nucleus was prevented by decreasing Kap60 function; however, diminishing Kap95 function resulted in almost complete ablation of PC synthesis via the CDP-choline pathway under conditions where Pct1 was extranuclear. Reagents-[methyl-14C]Choline chloride and [methyl-14C]methionine were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Affinity resins were purchased from Sigma (rabbit IgG-agarose), Stratagene (calmodulin-agarose), and Clontech (Talon). Complete and EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets were purchased from Roche Applied Science, and leupeptin, pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma. Antibodies used were anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and anti-red fluorescent protein (RFP) (Clontech), anti-His6 (Novagen), anti-c-Myc and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked IgG (Cell Signaling), and anti-TAP (Open Biosystems). Yeast Strains and Plasmids-The yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Tables 1 and 2. The pct1Δ::KanMx-containing strains were constructed by amplifying pct1Δ::KanMx from genomic DNA of pct1Δ::KanMx from the yeast gene deletion strain set (from Euroscarf) by PCR. Primers used hybridized 100 bp upstream of the start for the open reading frame and 100 bp downstream of the stop codon and were 5′-TACCCATTCCCCTTTCTTGCATACGCCAGTCACTTTTC-3′ and 5′-ATCTTTAAATATGTACATACGCTTGTTTATACGTGGAGGCG-3′. The linear PCR product was transformed into cells and G418-resistant transformants were selected and screened by PCR to verify the integration of the drug-resistant cassette into the PCT1 locus.

Minimal medium was SD (0.67% bacto-yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose) with 20 mg/liter adenine sulfate, 20 mg/liter l-histidine HCl, 100 mg/liter l-leucine, 30 mg/liter l-lysine, 20 mg/liter l-methionine, 20 mg/liter l-tryptophan, and 20 mg/liter uracil added as required, based on strain auxotrophies and plasmid maintenance. For expression of plasmids under control of a galactose-inducible promoter, dextrose was replaced with galactose. Co-Purification of Pct1-TAP with Protein-binding Partners-A TAP tag protocol was followed as described with the following modifications (40Andrews B.J. Bader G.D. Boone C. Nat.

Yeast strains containing genomic PCT1 plus or minus the TAP tag inserted at the 3′-end of the open reading frame were grown to midlog phase in 4 liters of YEPD at 25 °C. Cultures were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 10 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and pepstatin A. Cells were lysed by passage through a French press three times at 8,000 p.s.i. The concentration of KCl was adjusted by adding one-ninth volume of 2 m KCl. Cell extract was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to IgG-agarose beads in IPP150 buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and eluted by gravity flow, and the beads were washed with 30 ml of IPP150 buffer and then with 10 ml of TEV cleavage buffer (10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40/Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The beads were incubated with 1 ml of TEV cleavage buffer and 100 units of acTEV recombinant protease for 2 h at 16 °C. The eluate was recovered by gravity flow. Calmodulin beads washed with calmodulin binding buffer (10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40/Triton X-100) were added to the eluate along with 3 ml of calmodulin binding buffer and 3 μl of 1 m CaCl2. The suspension was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, poured into a column, and washed with 30 ml of calmodulin binding buffer. Samples were eluted by gravity flow with 1 ml of calmodulin elution buffer (10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40/Triton X-100). Samples were concentrated using a ReadyPrep Cleanup Kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and silver-stained, and bands were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Purification of Pct1-His6 and Determination of Protein Binding Partners-Pct1 expressed with a C-terminal His6 tag was purified from BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells as follows. Cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol to midlog phase at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced using 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cultures were transferred to 30 °C for 4 h. Cultures were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, cells were lysed using Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (B-Per; Pierce) containing EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) by passage through 16.5-, 18.5-, 20-, 21.5-, and 23-gauge needles. The lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was added to Co2+ resin (Talon) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl). Resin was pelleted and washed three times with 10 ml of wash buffer. Pct1-His6 was eluted using 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole. Pure Pct1-His6 was rebound to the Co2+ resin, and yeast cell protein extract was added to Pct1-His6-bound resin or empty resin for determination of Pct1-interacting proteins. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, Coomassie-stained, and excised for analysis by mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry-Proteins contained in gel slices were reduced with dithiothreitol, carboxamidomethylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin. Peptides were extracted with 70% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid. The extraction solvent was removed under vacuum, and the tryptic peptides were resuspended in 5% methanol, 0.5% formic acid. Liquid chromatography MS/MS was performed using an Ultimate pump and Famos autosampler (LC Packings, Amsterdam, Netherlands) interfaced to the nanoflow electrospray ionization source of a hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer (QTrap; Applied Biosystems). Samples were injected onto a capillary column (0.10 × 150-mm Chromolith C18, monolithic; Merck) at a flow rate of 1.2 μl/min. Solvent A consisted of 98% water, 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; Solvent B consisted of 2% water, 98% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; and the linear gradient was as follows: 5% solvent B to 35% solvent B over 35 min and then 90% B for 6 min before re-equilibration at 5% solvent B. The sample was sprayed through distal coated fused silica emitter tips, 75-μm inner diameter with a 15-μm inner diameter tip (New Objectives PicoTip). The capillary voltage was 2.10 kV with a declustering potential of 60 V, and the curtain gas was set to 15 (arbitrary units). Spectra were acquired using the information-dependent acquisition mode. The two most intense ions from the survey scan (375-1200 m/z) were selected for tandem MS, and the collision energy was set based on the mass of the precursor as determined by the m/z and charge. The raw MS/MS data were searched against NCBI yeast entries and against all SwissProt entries using the MASCOT algorithm (Matrix Science). Search parameters were peptide mass and fragment mass tolerance of 0.8 and 0.5 Da, respectively, one missed cleavage allowed. Oxidized methionines and carboxamidomethylated cysteines were chosen as variable modifications. Two-hybrid Interactions-The PCT1 open reading frame and the PCT1 open reading frame lacking its nuclear localization signal (without amino acid residues 2-75) were subcloned in frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (BD) in plasmid pAS1-CYH2. The open reading frames for KAP60 and KAP95 were subcloned in frame with the Gal4 DNA activation domain (AD) in plasmid pACT2. Plasmids were transformed into the reporter strain PJ69-4A (MATa trp1-901 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ) and grown on SC medium lacking Trp and Leu to select for plasmids. Cells were patched onto medium lacking Trp, Leu, Ade, and His to determine two-hybrid interactions (42Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). SNF1 in frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain and SNF4 in frame with the Gal4 activation domain were used as controls for nonspecific protein-protein interactions, as were empty vectors. Microscopy-Cells were observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope fitted with a plan-neofluor 100[×] oil immersion lens. Images were captured using a Zeiss Axio Cam HR using Axiovision 4.5 software. Live cells were visualized using differential interference contrast, GFP, or rhodamine filters, as required. To visualize GFP and RFP fusion proteins in live cells, cells were grown to midlog phase at 30 °C and mounted on a 2% agarose pad. To counterstain for DNA, cells were incubated in 2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 20 min before viewing. Strains expressing Pct1-Myc were visualized by immunofluorescence of formaldehyde-fixed cells in mounting medium that consisted of 90% glycerol, 10% phosphate-buffered saline, and DAPI. All primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. All secondary antibodies were used at 1:4000 dilution. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis-Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with 10% acrylamide or precast gradient 4-20% gels (Bio-Rad) for mass spectrometry samples. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or silver nitrate. Proteins separated on gels for Western blot analysis were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected using appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Metabolic Labeling-For PC synthesis through the CDP-choline or methylation pathways, 10 μm [14C]choline or [methyl-14C]methionine was added, respectively. Cells were grown to midlog phase at 25 °C (a portion was shifted to 37 °C for 1 h when analyzing kap60ts and kap95ts temperature-sensitive alleles), and radiolabel was added to the cultures for 1 h. Cells expressing proteins with a galactose-inducible promoter were shifted to galactose-containing medium for 2-3 h to induce expression of Pct1 before radiolabel was added. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 5 min in a tabletop centrifuge, and lipids were extracted using the method of Folch, as described (8Howe A.G. Zaremberg V. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44100-44107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14776-14783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The organic phase contained PC. Analysis of aqueous phase choline-containing metabolites was as follows. The aqueous phase was dried down overnight using vacuum and resuspended in distilled water. Samples were spotted on Silica Gel G plates (Analtech) and developed using a solvent of 50 ml of methanol, 50 ml of 0.6% NaCl, and 5 ml of NH4OH. The plate was dried and analyzed for radiolabel distribution using a BioScan radiometric detector. Radioactive bands were scraped into vials, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Identification of Kap95 and Kap60 as Potential Pct1-interacting Proteins-Proteins that directly bind to Pct1 or its mammalian homologue CCTα have yet to be identified. This is a major obstacle in determining the mechanisms regulating PC synthesis and its integration with other cell biological processes. Our strategy for identification of potential Pct1-interacting proteins was to use two different methods to identify Pct1-protein interactions. Proteins identified using both protocols were considered further. In the first approach, Pct1 containing a C-terminal Pct1-TAP tag inserted at the 3′-end of the PCT1 open reading frame, allowing for expression of PCT1 from within the genome and under control of its own promoter, was used. Pct1-TAP was expressed full-length and was biologically active (Fig. S1). This in vivo approach was supplemented by a second in vitro procedure whereby p"

Isolation of C57BL/6J mice from their 4 brothers growing in the same cage reduced goblet cells and MUC2 expression with a peak on day 8 in the rectum, but not in the colon. Gene expression analysis using a whole mouse genome microarray showed that the stress induced a 10-fold larger change in the gene expression in the rectum (722 genes) than in the colon (72 genes). The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) application organized the rectum-specific 711 genes into stress response-related pathways. Nuclear factor-kappaB-related cytokine networks constructed with IPA showed selective up-regulation of interleukin (IL)-18 mRNA expression, which was also confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The stress produced active forms of caspase 1, IL-18, and a negative regulator for goblet cells, Notch 1, only in the rectum. IL-18-knockout mouse rectum had significantly increased goblet cells and MUC2 mucin, compared with wild-type mouse rectum. The absence of IL-18 completely blocked the stress-induced changes in gene expression and the goblet cell responses in the rectum. Thus, IL-18 may be a crucial determinant for the vulnerability of the rectum to psychosocial stress."
https://openalex.org/W2151801746,"Combining genome sequence analysis and functional analysis, we show that some full-length copies of tirant are present in heterochromatic regions in Drosophila simulans and that when tested in vitro, these copies have a functional promoter. However, when inserted in heterochromatic regions, tirant copies are inactive in vivo, and only transcription of euchromatic copies can be detected. Thus, our data indicate that the localization of the element is a hallmark of its activity in vivo and raise the question of genomic invasions by transposable elements and the importance of their genomic integration sites."
https://openalex.org/W2023446579,"β-Cell-type KATP channels are octamers assembled from Kir6.2/KCNJ11 and SUR1/ABCC8. Adenine nucleotides play a major role in their regulation. Nucleotide binding to Kir6.2 inhibits channel activity, whereas ATP binding/hydrolysis on sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) opposes inhibition. Segments of the Kir6.2 N terminus are important for open-to-closed transitions, form part of the Kir ATP, sulfonylurea, and phosphoinositide binding sites, and interact with L0, an SUR cytoplasmic loop. Inputs from these elements link to the pore via the interfacial helix, which forms an elbow with the outer pore helix. Mutations that destabilize the interfacial helix increase channel activity, reduce sensitivity to inhibitory ATP and channel inhibitors, glibenclamide and repaglinide, and cause neonatal diabetes. We compared Kir6.x/SUR1 channels carrying the V59G substitution, a cause of the developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes syndrome, with a V59A substitution and the equivalent I60G mutation in the related Kir6.1 subunit from vascular smooth muscle. The substituted channels have increased PO values, decreased sensitivity to inhibitors, and impaired stimulation by phosphoinositides but retain sensitivity to Ba2+-block. The V59G and V59A channels are either not, or poorly, stimulated by phosphoinositides, respectively. Inhibition by sequestrating phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate with neomycin and polylysine is reduced in V59A, and abolished in V59G channels. Stimulation by SUR1 is intact, and increasing the concentration of inhibitory ATP restores the sensitivity of Val-59-substituted channels to glibenclamide. The I60G channels, strongly dependent on SUR stimulation, remain sensitive to sulfonylureas. The results suggest the interfacial helix dynamically links inhibitory inputs from the Kir N terminus to the gate and that sulfonylureas stabilize an inhibitory configuration. β-Cell-type KATP channels are octamers assembled from Kir6.2/KCNJ11 and SUR1/ABCC8.

FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 11Misler S. Falke L.C. Gillis K. McDaniel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7119-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). There are several subtypes of KATP channels (12Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) that subserve important functions in many tissues (13Seino S. Miki T. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 133-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The Kir6.2/SUR1 neuroendocrine channel in pancreatic β-cells couples insulin secretion to the plasma glucose level. KATP channels determine theβ-cell membrane potential and changes in the levels of ATP and ADP induced by changes in glucose metabolism determine channel activity. Antidiabetic sulfonyl-ureas such as glibenclamide (GBC) bind to SUR1 reducing its stimulatory action on the pore thus inducing channel closure that prompts insulin secretion (14Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement IV, J.P. Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 15Proks P. Reimann F. Green N. Gribble F. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S368-S376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in either subunit can alter the balanced action of adenine nucleotides on KATP channels and result in disorders of insulin secretion (16Ashcroft F.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 17Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 2008; 29: 265-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Loss of channel function is a cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (reviewed in Ref. 18Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), whereas mutations that increase channel activity are one cause of neonatal diabetes (reviewed in Ref. 17Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 2008; 29: 265-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mutations in SUR1 have been identified that produce more active channels via increased Mg-nucleotide-dependent stimulation of the pore (6Babenko A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8778-8782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Babenko A.P. Polak M. Cave H. Busiah K. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L.

Rev. 2008; 29: 265-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mutations in Kir6.2 have been identified in which the ability of ATP to close the channel is reduced due to a decreased affinity for inhibitory ATP or to an increased stability of the open state in the absence of ATP (16Ashcroft F.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 21Gloyn A.L. Pearson E.R. Antcliff J.F. Proks P. Bruining G.J. Slingerland A.S. Howard N. Srinivasan S. Silva J.M.

In patients carrying one copy of these “gain of function” mutations the balanced action of adenine nucleotides is altered and the resulting increase in channel activity leads to β-cell hyperpolarization and the decrease in insulin secretion that causes (transient or permanent) neonatal diabetes. KATP channel subunits are found in neurons (Kir6.2 with SUR1), in striated muscle (Kir6.2 with SUR2A), and in some smooth muscle (Kir6.1 with SUR2B). Some Kir6.2 mutations result in hyperactive channels that produce more severe syndromic phenotypes that include muscle weakness, developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes, termed the DEND syndrome (16Ashcroft F.M.

Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 27Nishida M.

Hattersley A.T. Ashcroft F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17539-17544Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and in isolated patches, 3 mm MgATP produces only a 10% block; in addition, the sensitivity of heterozygous channels to tolbutamide is strongly reduced (29Proks P. Antcliff J.F. Lippiat J. Gloyn A.L. Hattersley A.T. Ashcroft F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17539-17544Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 30Proks P. Girard C. Ashcroft F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In experiments at the single channel level in the absence of ATP, homozygous V59G channels exhibit a high open probability (PO = 0.83 versus 0.53 for the wild type (29Proks P. Antcliff J.F.

The reduced sensitivity of V59G channels to inhibition by ATP and tolbutamide has been attributed to the higher open probability, because both compounds stabilize a long lived interburst closed state (31Trapp S.

In addition, the V59G substitution reduces the surface expression of the mutant channel to ∼20% of wild type (35Lin C.W. Lin Y.W. Yan F.F. Casey J. Kochhar M. Pratt E.B. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1738-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two other substitutions of Val-59 occur, V59M (21Gloyn A.L. Pearson E.R. Antcliff J.F. Proks P. Bruining G.J.

Bell, personal communication. which produce an “intermediate” DEND phenotype. The V59M channel has been extensively characterized (22Koster J.C. Remedi M.S. Dao C. Nichols C.G. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2645-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Proks P. Antcliff J.F. Lippiat J. Gloyn A.L. Hattersley A.T. Ashcroft F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 2005; 14: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the properties of the recently identified V59A channel have not been established. Homology models imply the interfacial helix could serve to transmit conformational changes from the regulatory subunit to the outer transmembrane (M1) helices of Kir6.1 or 6.2 pores and thus affect gating. The nature of these conformational changes is uncertain, but the first N-terminal residues of Kir6.2 are known to be important for transitions from the open to the long lived closed state. Deletions of 5–35 residues from Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 produce highly active channels, PO > 0.9 (36Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43997-44004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 37Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), with reduced sensitivity to sulfonylureas and ATP (3Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Koster J.C. Sha Q. Shyng S. Nichols C.G. J.

Physiol. 1999; 518: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), similar to those seen in the V59G channels. We suggest that the N terminus of Kir6.x is an inhibitory element that interacts with parts of SUR1, specifically with the L0 linker, to facilitate the transition to the closed state and thus to restrict channel openings (39Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41577-41580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The observation that soluble, Kir N-terminal-like peptides can reduce the PO of ΔNKir6.1/SUR1 and ΔNKir6.2/SUR1 channels supports this idea (36Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43997-44004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The interfacial helix is the physical connection between the proximal N terminus and the outer M1 helix. We propose that substitutions (e.g. glycine, methionine, and alanine) for valine at position 59 can introduce flexibility into the V59G helix that impairs the inhibitory action of the proximal N terminus. To support this hypothesis, we sought to characterize the V59G mutation further, compare it with a V59A substitution and the analogous substitution, I60G, in Kir6.1 the pore-forming subunit of the vascular KATP channel. This channel is composed of Kir6.1 and SUR2B (40Yamada M. Isomoto S. Matsumoto S. Kondo C. Shindo T. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), however, for comparison we examined the I60G/SUR1 channel. Kir6.1 and 6.2 are 71% homologous overall, and the amino acids in the interfacial helix are identical except Val-59 is replaced by Ile-60 in Kir6.1. The Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 channels differ in their unitary conductance (∼36 versus 66 pS for Kir6.1 versus Kir6.2, respectively (41Takano M. Xie L.H. Otani H. Horie M. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The channels also differ in their gating by nucleotides in isolated patches: Kir6.1/SUR1 channels require strong activating conditions, whereas Kir6.2/SUR1 channels are open in nucleotide-free solutions (42Beech D.J. Zhang H. Nakao K. Bolton T.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 43Satoh E. Yamada M. Kondo C. Repunte V.P. Horio Y. Iijima T. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. 1998; 511: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Kir6.1-based channels have been reported either to have very low (41Takano M. Xie L.H. Otani H. Horie M. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 43Satoh E. Yamada M. Kondo C. Repunte V.P. Horio Y. Iijima T. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. 1998; 511: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or equivalent (34Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) sensitivity to inhibitory ATP when compared with Kir6.2-based channels. In view of these differences in gating on one hand and of the similarity in amino acid sequence around the mutation on the other it was of interest to compare the V59G and I60G/SUR1 KATP channels. Structure Prediction-To examine the effect of the mutations on the secondary structure of the interfacial helix of Kir6.x (Kir6.1: amino acids 55–67, Kir6.2: 54–66), the following programs were used: Predator (version 5a), JPRED, PSIPRED, nnpredict, and PhD (see Ref. 44Rost B. Methods Biochem. Anal. 2003; 44: 559-587PubMed Google Scholar for references). Molecular Biology, Cell Culture, and Transfection-Human Kir6.1, Kir6.2, and SUR1 cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. A Myc epitope was introduced into human Kir6.2 after leucine 100 by ligating complementary oligonucleotides with appropriate overhangs; this modification did not affect the functional properties of the protein (39Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41577-41580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The V59G, V59A, and I60G mutations were introduced into Kir6.2 and Kir6.1, respectively, using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutations were verified by sequencing the relevant DNA region (V59G) or the whole coding region (I60G and V59A). HEK 293 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium containing glutamine and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 μg/ml gentamycin as described (45Hambrock A. Loffler-Walz C. Russ U. Lange U. Quast U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant Kir6.x and SUR1 at a molar ratio of 1:1 using Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (46Hambrock A. Loffler-Walz C. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), encoding green fluorescent protein, was added for identification of transfected cells. Patch Clamp Experiments-Patch clamp experiments in the whole cell configuration were performed at 37 °C as described by Russ et al. (47Russ U. Hambrock A. Artunc F. Loffler-Walz C. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The bath was filled with (in mm): NaCl, 142; KCl, 2.8; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1; d(+)-glucose, 11; HEPES, 10; pH 7.4. Patch pipettes were filled with (in mm) potassium glutamate, 132; NaCl, 10; MgCl2, 2; HEPES, 10; EGTA, 1; Na2ATP, 1; and Na2GDP, 0.3 at pH 7.2 such that [Mg2+]free was ∼0.85 mm and that there was a balance between inhibition and activation. Pipettes had a resistance of 3–5 MΩ. Cells were clamped at –60 mV. To determine the reversal potential of the currents, square pulses, 0.5-s duration, ranging from –110 to +10 mV in 20-mV steps were applied every 12 s. Recordings in which the reversal potential deviated from ∼–90 mV were rejected. For experiments in the cell-attached and inside-out configuration, pipettes with a larger diameter were used (resistance of 1.0–1.5 MΩ). Experiments were performed at 22 °C. Pipette and bath were filled with a high K+-Ringer solution containing (in mm) KCl, 142; NaCl, 2.8; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1; d(+)-glucose, 11; HEPES, 10; titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. In the inside-out mode and after patch excision, the pipette was moved in front of a pipe filled with a high K+ buffer containing (in mm) KCl, 142; MgCl2, 0.7–30.7 (according to the nucleotides added); d(+)-glucose, 11; Na2ATP, 0–30; EGTA, 0.1 (0 when adding Ba2+); HEPES, 10; titrated to pH 7.2 with NaOH at 22 °C and containing the channel modulators of interest. For experiments in Mg2+-free buffer, MgCl2 was omitted and EGTA was replaced by 1 mm EDTA. In a series of experiments using high ATP concentrations (10 and 30 mm), NaCl was added to the bath and pipe solutions with lower ATP concentration to minimize differences in osmolarity. Patches were generally clamped at –50 mV except for examination of the Ba2+-induced block in the inside-out configuration. Ba2+ applied to the inside of the patch produced only a slight block at –50 mV (because it was flushed out of the pore by the inward K+ current at negative voltage), whereas at +50 mV a complete block was achieved (as Ba2+ was dragged into the pore by the outward current). Some inhibitors (e.g. neomycin) were tested at both –50 and +50 mV. In experiments with the V59G/SUR1 channel in the inside-out configuration and at symmetrical high K+ solution, the leak current was determined as the outward current remaining in the presence of 1 mm Ba2+ at +50 mV, and it was assumed that, at –50 mV, the leak current was of the same magnitude (with inverted sign), thus determining the zero current level. Data were filtered at 0.2 kHz and sampled at 1 kHz. The open probability (PO) of the V59A channel was determined in the inside-out configuration using Sylgard-coated pipettes. Recordings from patches with one channel were filtered at 2.5 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz. Amplitude histograms were generated using PulseTools (Heka, Lambrecht, Germany) and analyzed by fitting a superposition of 2 Gaussian distributions to the data. [3H]GBC Competition Experiments-Binding experiments were performed in intact cells at 37 °C as described by Hambrock et al. (45Hambrock A. Loffler-Walz C. Russ U. Lange U. Quast U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using an incubation buffer containing (in mm): NaCl, 129; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 1.2; CaCl2, 1.25; d(+)-glucose, 11; NaHCO3, 5; HEPES, 10 at pH 7.4. [3H]GBC was 1–2 nm; nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 nm GBC and was ∼10% of total binding. Data Analysis and Statistics-Channel inhibition and equilibrium binding inhibition curves were analyzed according to the Hill equation,y=100-A(1+10nH(pX-pIC50))Eq. 1 as described before (45Hambrock A. Loffler-Walz C. Russ U. Lange U. Quast U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with y denoting the current or total binding, A the maximum inhibition (amplitude or extent of specific binding), nH the Hill coefficient, and x the inhibitor concentration with pX = –log X and pIC50 = –log IC50. In the text, the IC50 values with their 95% confidence interval are given. IC50 values are lognormally distributed (48Christopoulos A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 351-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); therefore the corresponding pIC50 values were compared by using the Student t-test after the data had passed the normality and equal variance tests using the program SigmaStat 3.1 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Materials-The reagents and media used for cell culture and transfection were from Invitrogen, the other chemicals, including nucleotides, were from Sigma. Glibenclamide, tolbutamide, and diazoxide were purchased from Sigma; repaglinide was a kind gift from Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). The KATP channel modulators were dissolved in DMSO/ethanol (50/50, v/v) and further diluted with the same solvent or with incubation buffer (final solvent concentration in the assays, <1%). [3H]GBC (specific activity, 1.85 TBq/mmol) was purchased from Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences. Poly-d-lysine-HBr (mean molecular weight 41,400; chain length ∼200) was from Sigma. Structure Prediction-Glycine has a lower helix propensity than valine (49Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar), and two, Predator and nnpredict, out of five protein secondary structure programs predicted that the V59G substitution will destabilize and thus break the interfacial helix. The PSIPRED and PhD programs predicted no structural change with the V59G mutation; JPRED did not recognize the helix structure. The same structural predictions were obtained for the I60G substitution in Kir6.1. Alanine and methionine have a greater helix propensity on the Chou-Fasman scale (49Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar) than glycine, are not expected to interrupt the interfacial helix, but may change its flexibility. Basic Observations on Kir6.2 Channels-Fig. 1 shows basic characteristics of the wild-type and Val-59-substituted channels determined in the whole cell configuration. After breaking into a cell expressing wild-type channels, a current developed during cell dialysis with a nucleotide containing activating solution (Fig. 1a). The current was totally inhibited by glibenclamide (GBC, 0.1 μm), indicating it goes through KATP channels. In contrast, in cells expressing the Val-59-substituted channels, a current was present immediately upon breaking into the cell indicating channels were open prior to dialysis (Fig. 1, b and c). In agreement with their reported reduced sensitivity to sulfonylureas (29Proks P. Antcliff J.F. Lippiat J. Gloyn A.L. Hattersley A.T. Ashcroft F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17539-17544Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) the V59G currents were not affected by GBC (1 μm) (Fig. 1b; n = 12). The V59A channels display an intermediate sensitivity to 1 μm glibenclamide, ∼40% inhibition. Both of the Val-59-subsitituted channels are blocked by a high concentration of Ba2+ (1 mm). Fig. 2 shows there is no significant difference in Ba2+ sensitivity between the wild-type and V59G channels.FIGURE 2Concentration-dependent inhibition of V59G and wild-type Kir6.2/SUR1 channels by Ba2+. Experiments were performed using the inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique at +50 mV (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data are means of eight and six patches for the mutant and wild-type channels, respectively, and curve analysis with the Hill coefficient 1.0 gave pIC50 values of 5.38 ± 0.02 and 5.45 ± 0.07, respectively (not different). The inset shows a typical experiment with V59G channels. The zero current level was determined in the presence of Ba2+ (1 mm) and is given by the dotted line. There was a slight channel rundown; Ba2+ was applied via a pipe to the inside of the patch.View Large Image Figure ViewerDown"
https://openalex.org/W2038936725,"Presenilin (PS) is involved in many cellular events under physiological and pathological conditions. Previous reports have revealed that PS deficiency results in hyperproliferation and resistance to apoptotic cell death. In the present study, we investigated the effects of PS on beta-catenin and cell mortality during serum deprivation. Under these conditions, PS1/PS2 double-knockout MEFs showed aberrant accumulation of phospho-beta-catenin, higher ROS generation, and notable cell death. Inhibition of beta-catenin phosphorylation by LiCl reversed ROS generation and cell death in PS deficient cells. In addition, the K19/49R mutant form of beta-catenin, which undergoes normal phosphorylation but not ubiquitination, induced cytotoxicity, while the phosphorylation deficient S37A beta-catenin mutant failed to induce cytotoxicity. These results indicate that aberrant accumulation of phospho-beta-catenin underlies ROS-mediated cell death in the absence of PS. We propose that the regulation of beta-catenin is useful for identifying therapeutic targets of hyperproliferative diseases and other degenerative conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2142100350,"Intracellular acidosis is a profound negative regulator of myocardial performance. We hypothesized that titrating myofilament calcium sensitivity by a single histidine substituted cardiac troponin I (A164H) would protect the whole animal physiological response to acidosis in vivo. To experimentally induce severe hypercapnic acidosis, mice were exposed to a 40% CO(2) challenge. By echocardiography, it was found that systolic function and ventricular geometry were maintained in cTnI A164H transgenic (Tg) mice. By contrast, non-Tg (Ntg) littermates experienced rapid and marked cardiac decompensation during this same challenge. For detailed hemodymanic assessment, Millar pressure-conductance catheterization was performed while animals were treated with a beta-blocker, esmolol, during a severe hypercapnic acidosis challenge. Survival and load-independent measures of contractility were significantly greater in Tg vs. Ntg mice. This assay showed that Ntg mice had 100% mortality within 5 min of acidosis. By contrast, systolic and diastolic function were protected in Tg mice during acidosis, and they had 100% survival. This study shows that, independent of any beta-adrenergic compensation, myofilament-based molecular manipulation of inotropy by histidine-modified troponin I maintains cardiac inotropic and lusitropic performance and markedly improves survival during severe acidosis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2024905384,"Rev is an essential regulatory protein in the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and other lentiviruses, including HIV-1. It binds incompletely spliced viral mRNAs and shuttles them from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a critical prerequisite for the production of viral structural proteins and genomic RNA. Despite its important role in production of infectious virus, the development of antiviral therapies directed against Rev has been hampered by the lack of an experimentally-determined structure of the full length protein. We have used a combined computational and biochemical approach to generate and evaluate a structural model of the Rev protein. The modeled EIAV Rev (ERev) structure includes a total of 6 helices, four of which form an anti-parallel four-helix bundle. The first helix contains the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES). An arginine-rich RNA binding motif, RRDRW, is located in a solvent-exposed loop region. An ERLE motif required for Rev activity is predicted to be buried in the core of modeled structure where it plays an essential role in stabilization of the Rev fold. This structural model is supported by existing genetic and functional data as well as by targeted mutagenesis of residues predicted to be essential for overall structural integrity. Our predicted structure should increase understanding of structure-function relationships in Rev and may provide a basis for the design of new therapies for lentiviral diseases."
