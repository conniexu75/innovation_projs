Using a model, we show that population heterogeneity can affect disease-induced immunity considerably because the proportion of infected individuals in groups with the highest contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. We estimate that if R 0 = 2.5 in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity, then the disease-induced herd immunity level can be ~43%, which is substantially less than the classical herd immunity level of 60% obtained through homogeneous immunization of the population. Our estimates should be interpreted as an illustration of how population heterogeneity affects herd immunity rather than as an exact value or even a best estimate."

https://openalex.org/W3036691738,"The resolution and dimensionality with which biologists can characterize cell types have expanded dramatically in recent years, and intersectional consideration of such features (e.g., multiple gene expression and anatomical parameters) is increasingly understood to be essential. At the same time, genetically targeted technology for writing in and reading out activity patterns for cells in living organisms has enabled causal investigation in physiology and behavior; however, cell-type-specific delivery of these tools (including microbial opsins for optogenetics and genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators) has thus far fallen short of versatile targeting to cells jointly defined by many individually selected features. Here, we develop a comprehensive intersectional targeting toolbox including 39 novel vectors for joint-feature-targeted delivery of 13 molecular payloads (including opsins, indicators, and fluorophores), systematic approaches for development and optimization of new intersectional tools, hardware for in vivo monitoring of expression dynamics, and the first versatile single-virus tools (Triplesect) that enable targeting of triply defined cell types."
https://openalex.org/W3037132242,"Background & methods Recent social movements have highlighted fatal police violence as an enduring public health problem in the United States. To solve it, the public requires basic information, such as understanding where rates of fatal police violence are particularly high, and for which groups. Existing mapping efforts, though critically important, often use inappropriate statistical methods and can produce misleading, unstable rates when denominators are small. To fill this gap, we use inverse-variance-weighted multilevel models to estimate overall and race-stratified rates of fatal police violence for all Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the U.S. (2013–2017), as well as racial inequities in these rates. We analyzed the most recent, reliable data from Fatal Encounters, a citizen science initiative that aggregates and verifies media reports. Results Rates of police-related fatalities varied dramatically, with the deadliest MSAs exhibiting rates nine times those of the least deadly. Overall rates in Southwestern MSAs were highest, with lower rates in the northern Midwest and Northeast. Yet this pattern was reversed for Black-White inequities, with Northeast and Midwest MSAs exhibiting the highest inequities nationwide. Our main results excluded deaths that could be considered accidents (e.g., vehicular collisions), but sensitivity analyses demonstrated that doing so may underestimate the rate of fatal police violence in some MSAs by 60%. Black-White and Latinx-White inequities were slightly underestimated nationally by excluding reportedly ‘accidental’ deaths, but MSA-specific inequities were sometimes severely under- or over-estimated. Conclusions Preventing fatal police violence in different areas of the country will likely require unique solutions. Estimates of the severity of these problems (overall rates, racial inequities, specific causes of death) in any given MSA are quite sensitive to which types of deaths are analyzed, and whether race and cause of death are attributed correctly. Monitoring and mapping these rates using appropriate methods is critical for government accountability and successful prevention."

https://openalex.org/W3037753162,"Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has garnered attention after the success of the REDUCE-IT trial, which contradicted previous conclusions on EPA for cardiovascular disease risk. Here we first investigated EPA's preventative role on hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. EPA ethyl esters prevented obesity-induced glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia in C57BL/6J mice. Supporting NHANES analyses showed that fasting glucose levels of obese adults were inversely related to EPA intake. We next investigated how EPA improved murine hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. EPA overturned the obesity-driven decrement in the concentration of 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE) in white adipose tissue and liver. Treatment of obese inbred mice with RvE1, the downstream immunoresolvant metabolite of 18-HEPE, but not 18-HEPE itself, reversed hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia through the G-protein coupled receptor ERV1/ChemR23. To translate the findings, we determined if the effects of RvE1 were dependent on host genetics. RvE1's effects on hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia were divergent in diversity outbred mice that model human genetic variation. Secondary SNP analyses further confirmed extensive genetic variation in human RvE1/EPA-metabolizing genes. Collectively, the data suggest EPA prevents hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, in part, through RvE1's activation of ERV1/ChemR23 in a host genetic manner. The studies underscore the need for personalized administration of RvE1 based on genetic/metabolic enzyme profiles."
https://openalex.org/W3037425074,"Aim To investigate markers of systemic inflammation in pre- and postmenopausal women and identify possible predictors of systemic inflammation with menopause. Methods Cross-sectional study of 69 healthy women between 45- and 60 years. Blood samples were collected to assess leukocyte subsets and plasma cytokines. MRI and DXA scans were performed to assess body composition. Through uni- and multivariate analyses, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), visceral fat mass and age were evaluated as predictors of systemic inflammation in relation to menopause. Results Postmenopausal women tended to have higher leukocyte counts (5.4 x109 vs. 4.9 x109 cells/l, p = 0.05) reflected in increased total lymphocytes (1.8 x109 vs. 1.6 x109 cells/l, p = 0.01) and monocytes (0.5 x109 vs. 0.4 x109 cells/l, p = 0.02), compared to premenopausal women. Increased visceral fat mass was a strong predictor of high leukocyte subsets. Postmenopausal women had higher plasma TNF-α (2.24 vs. 1.91 pg/ml, p = 0.01) and IL-6 (0.45 vs. 0.33 pg/ml, p = 0.004) compared to premenopausal women and high FSH was a significant predictor of increased plasma TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Menopause was further associated with increased T-cells (1,336 vs. 1,128 cells/μl, p = 0.04) reflected in significantly higher counts of exhausted-, senescent-, and memory CD4+ T-cell subsets. Conclusions Menopause is associated with increased systemic inflammation as well as exhausted- and senescent T-cells. We suggest, that both increased visceral fat mass and declining sex hormone levels might contribute to postmenopausal systemic inflammation and calls for further large-scale studies to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3037767747,"Adropin as a secretory peptide has shown a protective role on the disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the role and mechanism of this peptide on the hepatic glucose production has remained unclear. Adropin knockout (KO) mice were generated to explore its effects on the enhanced hepatic glucose production in obesity. We found that compared to wild-type (WT) mice, adropin-KO mice developed the unbalanced enhanced hepatic glucose production in advance of the whole-body insulin resistance (IR) by high-fat diet (HFD). Mechanistically, adropin dissociated CREB-CRTC2 and FoxO1-PGC1α complex and reduced their binding to the promoters of G6Pase and PEPCK to decrease glucose production in IR. However, these effects were not observed in insulin-sensitive hepatocytes. Furthermore, in IR hepatocytes, dampened AMPK signaling was re-activated by adropin treatment via inhibition of PP2A. To further authenticate AMPK role in vivo, we administrated HFD-fed mice with AAV8-CA AMPKα and found that AMPK activation functionally restored the aberrant glucose production and IR induced by adropin-deficiency. This study provides evidence that adropin activates the AMPK pathway via inhibition of PP2A and decreases the liver glucose production in IR context. Therefore, adropin may represent a novel target for the prevention and treatment of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3037354310,"Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum) is one of the top crops in Kazakhstan, where it is cultivated in different ecological niches, mainly at higher latitudes in the steppe zone of the northern region. Therefore, local breeding programs for durum wheat are primarily focused on selection for high productivity in Northern Kazakhstan based on the introduction of promising foreign germplasm and the adoption of marker-assisted selection. In this study, a world tetraploid wheat collection consisted of 184 primitive and domesticated accessions, which were previously genotyped using 16,425 polymorphic SNP markers, was field-tested in Northern and South-eastern Kazakhstan. The field tests have allowed the identification of 80 durum wheat promising lines in Northern Kazakhstan in comparison with a local standard cultivar. Also, GGE (Genotype and Genotype by Environment) biplot analyses for yield performance revealed that accessions of T. dicoccum, T. carthlicum, and T. turanicum also have potential to improve durum wheat yield in the region. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) has allowed the identification of 83 MTAs (marker-trait associations) for heading date, seed maturation time, plant height, spike length, number of fertile spikes, number of kernels per spike, and thousand kernel weight. The comparison of the 83 identified MTAs with those previously reported in GWAS for durum wheat suggests that 38 MTAs are presumably novel, while the co-localization of a large number of MTAs with those previously published confirms the validity of the results of this study. The MTAs reported herewith will provide the opportunity to implement marker-assisted selection in ongoing durum wheat breeding projects targeting higher productivity in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3037577338,"The phenotypes of each breast cancer subtype are defined by their transcriptomes. However, the transcription factors that regulate differential patterns of gene expression that contribute to specific disease outcomes are not well understood. Here, using gene silencing and overexpression approaches, RNA-Seq, and splicing analysis, we report that the transcription factor B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and drives metastatic disease. Moreover, BCL11A promotes cancer cell invasion by suppressing the expression of muscleblind-like splicing regulator 1 (MBNL1), a splicing regulator that suppresses metastasis. This ultimately increases the levels of an alternatively spliced isoform of integrin-α6 (ITGA6), which is associated with worse patient outcomes. These results suggest that BCL11A sustains TNBC cell invasion and metastatic growth by repressing MBNL1-directed splicing of ITGA6. Our findings also indicate that BCL11A lies at the interface of transcription and splicing and promotes aggressive TNBC phenotypes.

Our findings also indicate that BCL11A lies at the interface of transcription and splicing and promotes aggressive TNBC phenotypes. Breast cancer subtypes are defined by unique transcriptomes that are reflective of their developmental lineage and specify distinct phenotypes. The luminal breast epithelial lineage highly expresses estrogen receptor (ER), FOXA1, and GATA3, and these factors drive more differentiated breast cancer phenotypes that are associated with good patient prognoses (1Fallahpour S. Navaneelan T. De P. Borgo A. Breast cancer survival by molecular subtype: a population-based analysis of cancer registry data.CMAJ Open. 2017; 5 (28951445): E734-E73910.9778/cmajo.20170030Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Haque R.

In contrast, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), while heterogeneous, are generally more primitive and are devoid of ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 receptors. These tumors convey the poorest prognoses because of the high incidence of metastatic recurrence, with a median 5-year survival rate of ∼68% depending on the patient population (3Ovcaricek T. Frkovic S. Matos E. Mozina B. Borstnar S. Triple negative breast cancer–prognostic factors and survival.Radiol. Oncol. 2011; 45: 4610.2478/v10019-010-0054-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Once metastasis has occurred, patient prognosis is very poor, with a median overall survival of only 13 months (4Kassam F. Enright K. Dent R. Dranitsaris G. Myers J. Flynn C. Fralick M. Kumar R. Clemons M. Survival outcomes for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer: implications for clinical practice and trial design.Clin.

Thus, there is a significant need to understand the molecular mechanisms that drive metastatic disease in TNBC patients. Development of metastases requires tumor cells to disengage their cellular adhesions, allowing them to dissociate from the primary tumor, migrate, and invade the basement membrane, providing vascular access. After extravasation, tumor cells invade secondary sites and reinitiate growth pathways. Only a small percentage of cells that are shed from the primary tumor possess these invasive and tumor-initiating properties and, hence, are termed tumor-initiating cells (TIC) (5Luzzi K.J.

TIC are more migratory and invasive than most cells within the tumor bulk and exhibit a molecular profile that significantly overlaps that of cells that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (7Mani S.A.

The rapid rate of metastatic recurrence in TNBC is thought to be due, in part, to the high proportion of TIC within these tumors compared with luminal breast cancers (7Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.J.

However, it is likely that additional, lineage-associated factors also contribute to metastatic progression of this disease. The zinc finger transcription factor, BCL11A, was initially identified because of a chromosomal translocation site in chronic B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (12Satterwhite E. Sonoki T. Willis T.G.

In the mouse mammary gland, BCL11A is one of 22 genes defining an embryonic mammary signature that is silenced in adult epithelia and reactivated in mouse and human TNBC (20Zvelebil M. Oliemuller E.

BCL11A silencing also reduces the TIC population in TNBC xenografts, and ectopic BCL11A expression in nontransformed immortalized mammary epithelial cells can promote xenograft tumor formation (14Khaled W.T.

Whereas these studies have implicated BCL11A as a key driver of stem cell fate in the mammary epithelium that controls primary tumor growth, it is unknown whether this factor also contributes to metastatic progression. The potential for BCL11A to contribute to the metastatic cascade is supported by it being a component of an 11-gene expression signature that is prognostic for breast cancer metastasis to the bone (22Hayashi N. Manyam G.C. Gonzalez-Angulo A.M. Niikura N. Yamauchi H. Nakamura S. Hortobagyi G.N. Baggerly K.A. Ueno N.T.

In addition to a lack of clarity regarding its role in metastasis, the downstream transcriptional targets of BCL11A and the factors that preclude its expression in luminal tumors remain to be discovered. Here, we define a new pathway involving BCL11A that controls TNBC metastasis. Elucidation of the BCL11A-regulated transcriptome, followed by genetic modulation studies, further revealed that BCL11A is necessary for sustained expression of extracellular matrix and adhesion genes as well as the RNA splicing regulator, muscleblind-like protein 1 (MBNL1), and its downstream targets. Basal breast cancer is the most abundant subtype of TNBC. Consistent with prior reports, we found that BCL11A expression is highly upregulated in basal breast cancer compared with the more differentiated luminal tumors in a publicly available data set (24Farmer P.

Further confirming its differential expression, the level of BCL11A is also significantly higher in TNBC than in all other breast cancer subtypes in the TCGA data set (Fig. 1A, right) (14Khaled W.T.

Because increased stem cell activity can promote metastatic disease in various cancers, we postulated that BCL11A is essential for breast cancer metastasis. To test this, we first assessed the impact of altering BCL11A levels on in vitro surrogates of metastatic behaviors in cell lines representing two TNBC subtypes: MDA-MB-231 (mesenchymal-like or claudin-low subtype of TNBC) and MDA-MB-468 cells (basal-like 1) (26Lehmann B.D.

Transiently silencing BCL11A (Fig. 1B) had no impact on cell migration for either cell line (Fig. 1C). However, invasion was significantly reduced with the loss of BCL11A expression compared with the nonsilencing control (Fig. 1D), in alignment with a previous report (23Wang X. Xu Y. Xu K. Chen Y. Xiao X. Guan X. BCL11A confers cell invasion and migration in androgen receptor-positive triple-negative breast cancer.Oncol.

Together, these data indicate that sustained BCL11A expression is necessary to maintain the invasive phenotype of TNBC cells and may ultimately control their metastatic potential. To directly assess the impact of BCL11A on metastatic outgrowth, we transduced luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-MB-231-FFluc) with lentiviral vectors expressing an shRNA targeting BCL11A or a nonsilencing control. Upon confirming BCL11A silencing (Fig. 1E), these cells were injected into the left ventricles of the hearts of immunocompromised mice to assess their ability to colonize the body. After 18 days, BCL11A-silenced cells were significantly compromised in their ability to establish metastatic disease compared with control cells (Fig. 1F). Combined, these data suggest that sustained expression of BCL11A is necessary for invasion and metastatic outgrowth in models of TNBC. To determine whether BCL11A is also sufficient to induce metastasis within the context of TNBC, we overexpressed BCL11A in a cell line of low metastatic potential. Compared with the MDA-MB-231 cell line, SUM149PT cells (BSL2 TNBC subtype) have a lower incidence of cancer stem cells and are less invasive in vitro and in vivo (26Lehmann B.D. Bauer J.A. Chen X.

Similar to BCL11A-silenced cells, overexpression of BCL11A had no impact on cell growth (Fig. 2, A and B). However, BCL11A overexpression significantly increased metastatic outgrowth in the lungs 31 days after intracardiac injection compared with cells transduced with an empty vector (Fig. 2C). Whereas no macroscopic metastases were observed in control mice, 4/9 mice injected with BCL11A-overexpressing cells had visible macrometastatic lesions (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2). Given the function of BCL11A as a transcriptional regulator, we expected that its impact on invasion and metastatic outgrowth would be mediated by changes in target gene expression. Therefore, we used RNA-Seq to identify candidate BCL11A target genes. To identify early proximal targets of BCL11A, rather than downstream changes, that corresponded to invasion changes in vitro, MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with siRNAs against BCL11A or a nonsilencing control (Fig. 3A), and changes in RNA expression were evaluated. This revealed 183 and 395 genes that were up- or downregulated, respectively (Table S1), with transient BCL11A silencing. The top 25 most significantly changed genes are shown in Fig. 3B. The downregulated gene set was most strongly enriched in pathways involved in extracellular matrix organization and integrins in angiogenesis (top 4 enriched pathways are shown in Fig. 3C, left), which was consistent with the loss of invasion and metastatic behaviors that occurs with BCL11A silencing. In contrast, the upregulated gene set was enriched in cell cycle and mitosis-associated genes (top 4 enriched pathways shown in Fig. 3C, right). This was surprising because we, and others, have observed an absence of changes in cell number following BCL11A silencing (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1) (14Khaled W.T. Choon Lee S. Stingl J. Chen X. Raza Ali H. Rueda O.M. Hadi F. Wang J. Yu Y. Chin S.-F. Stratton M. Futreal A. Jenkins N.A. Aparicio S. Copeland N.G. et al.BCL11A is a triple-negative breast cancer gene with critical functions in stem and progenitor cells.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (25574598): 598710.1038/ncomms6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Notably, Bcl11a-null mice die shortly after birth, and we were unable to generate homozygous BCL11A-null clones in the MDA-MB-231 cell line using CRISPR/Cas9, suggesting that there is a critical threshold or time dependence for BCL11A expression that is required for long-term cell viability/growth. Regardless, the downregulated gene set identified several potential candidates that may collaborate to modulate metastatic behaviors. In addition to changes in absolute expression of various genes, we also observed a striking change in the spliced isoforms for many genes. To determine whether BCL11A is associated with splicing in human basal breast cancers, we interrogated publicly available gene expression datasets to identify the set of genes that are most positively correlated with BCL11A (25Cancer Genome Atlas Network Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours.Nature. 2012; 490: 61-7010.1038/nature11412Crossref PubMed Scopus (8301) Google Scholar, 32Brueffer C.

Evaluation of these genes for functionality revealed that the highest ranked gene ontologies (GO) were “mRNA splicing” (GO 0000398; p = 2 × 10−4) and “mRNA splice site selections” (GO 0006376; p = 9.44 × 10−4), suggesting that BCL11A is a major regulator of the spliced transcriptome in basal breast cancers. Analysis of the RNA-Seq data set described here revealed 415 significant alternative splicing events, including 256 alternatively spliced cassette (cass) exons occurring in response to BCL11A silencing (Fig. 3D). We identified cassette exons for which the change in the percent exons spliced in (ΔPSI) was ≥10. This yielded 107 differentially spliced cassette exons that occur when BCL11A is repressed (Table S2). In alignment with the group of genes whose expression is downregulated with BCL11A silencing, genes that were alternatively spliced were also enriched in pathways controlling cell adhesion (adjusted p < 0.0421), as well as other ontologies. These data suggest that BCL11A controls the transcriptome, particularly that associated with cell adhesion, through at least two processes: gene expression and mRNA splicing. Given that BCL11A-correlated genes are associated with mRNA splicing functions in basal breast cancer, our observation that BCL11A silencing results in a significant shift in splicing events in MDA-MB-231 cells, and that these splicing events are also enriched in pathways governing extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, we interrogated the RNA-Seq data set for genes that encode splicing factors that are differentially expressed in response to BCL11A silencing. One of the genes whose expression was most significantly induced was the RNA-splicing regulator muscleblind-like protein 1 (MBNL1), an established suppressor of TNBC invasion and metastasis (Fig. 3E). MBNL1 promotes cellular differentiation by repressing embryonic stem and iPS cell-specific alternative splicing programs (33Han H. Irimia M. Ross P.J. Sung H.-K. Alipanahi B. David L. Golipour A.

Thus, we proposed that BCL11A regulation of MBNL1 contributes to the alternative splicing events that occur when BCL11A expression is altered. We first confirmed that BCL11A represses the expression of MBNL1 in independent samples of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. As expected, transient silencing of BCL11A increased MBNL1 mRNA and protein expression in both cell lines (Fig. 4, A and B, and Fig. S3A). MBNL1 was also upregulated in MDA-MB-231-FFLuc cells that had undergone stable silencing of BCL11A using 5 independent shRNAs (Fig. S3B). Conversely, MBNL1 protein expression was reduced in SUM149PT cells upon transient overexpression of BCL11A (Fig. S3C). These data confirm that BCL11A is both necessary and sufficient to suppress MBNL1 expression in TNBC. To determine whether BCL11A directly binds to the MBNL1 gene to repress its expression, we examined publicly available genome-wide ChIP-Seq data for BCL11A in human lymphoblastoid (GM12878) and embryonic stem cell lines (h1-hESC) available in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) (36The E.P.C.

Twelve phenolic components were identified from the EAF of C. cyrtophyllum. Additionally, acteoside (1) was found to be a major component (0.803 g, 0.54%) and show DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities with IC50 values of 79.65±3.4 and 23.00±1.5 μg/ml, indicating it is principally responsible for the significant total antioxidant effect of C. cyrtophyllum.

Based on genetics, call properties, adult morphology, tadpole morphology and niche modelling, we determined the segregated status species of D. suweonensis and D. immaculatus. We then proceeded to describe a new treefrog species, D. flaviventris sp. nov., from the central lowlands of the Republic of Korea. The new species is geographically segregated from D. suweonensis by the Chilgap mountain range and known to occur only in the area of Buyeo, Nonsan and Iksan in the Republic of Korea. While the Yellow sea is the principal element to the current isolation of the three clades, the paleorivers of the Yellow sea basin are likely to have been the major factor for the divergences within this clade. We recommend conducting rapid conservation assessments as these species are present on very narrow and declining ranges."

Children prenatally exposed to alcohol or early life trauma (ELT) are at higher risk of impairment of these skills and may require intervention to address self-regulation deficits. Researchers partnered with the local Aboriginal health organization and schools to develop and pilot a manualized version of the Alert Program® in the Fitzroy Valley, north Western Australia, a region with documented high rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and ELT. This self-controlled cluster randomized trial evaluated the effect of an 8-week Alert Program® intervention on children's executive functioning and self-regulation skills. Following parent or caregiver consent (referred to hereafter as parent), 271 students were enrolled in the study. This reflects a 75% participation rate and indicates the strong community support that exists for the study. Teachers from 26 primary school classrooms across eight Fitzroy Valley schools received training to deliver eight, one-hour Alert Program® lessons over eight-weeks to students. Student outcomes were measured by parent and teacher ratings of children's behavioral, emotional, and cognitive regulation. The mean number of lessons attended by children was 4.2. Although no significant improvements to children's executive functioning skills or behavior were detected via the teacher-rated measures as hypothesized, statistically significant improvements were noted on parent-rated measures of executive functioning and behavior. The effectiveness of future self-regulation programs may be enhanced through multimodal delivery through home, school and community based settings to maximize children's exposure to the intervention. Despite mixed findings of effect, this study was an important first step in adapting and evaluating the Alert Program® for use in remote Australian Aboriginal community schools, where access to self-regulation interventions is limited."
https://openalex.org/W3037672119,"The endonuclease Artemis is responsible for opening DNA hairpins during V(D)J recombination and for processing a subset of pathological DNA double-strand breaks. Artemis is an attractive target for the development of therapeutics to manage various B cell and T cell tumors, because failure to open DNA hairpins and accumulation of chromosomal breaks may reduce the proliferation and viability of pre-T and pre-B cell derivatives. However, structure-based drug discovery of specific Artemis inhibitors has been hampered by a lack of crystal structures. Here, we report the structure of the catalytic domain of recombinant human Artemis. The catalytic domain displayed a polypeptide fold similar overall to those of other members in the DNA cross-link repair gene SNM1 family and in mRNA 3′-end-processing endonuclease CPSF-73, containing metallo-β-lactamase and β-CASP domains and a cluster of conserved histidine and aspartate residues capable of binding two metal atoms in the catalytic site. As in SNM1A, only one zinc ion was located in the Artemis active site. However, Artemis displayed several unique features. Unlike in other members of this enzyme class, a second zinc ion was present in the β-CASP domain that leads to structural reorientation of the putative DNA-binding surface and extends the substrate-binding pocket to a new pocket, pocket III. Moreover, the substrate-binding surface exhibited a dominant and extensive positive charge distribution compared with that in the structures of SNM1A and SNM1B, presumably because of the structurally distinct DNA substrate of Artemis. The structural features identified here may provide opportunities for designing selective Artemis inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3037329228,"The interplay between G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for controlling neuronal activity that shapes neuromodulatory outcomes.

These results uncover a mechanistic interplay between GPCRs involved in controlling opioidergic neuromodulation in the brain. The mammalian brain features a staggering number of neuromodulatory systems that often converge on the same neurons and must be integrated and balanced through a system of opposing signaling and feedback mechanisms (1Huang Y. Thathiah A. Regulation of neuronal communication by G protein-coupled receptors.FEBS Lett. 2015; 589 (25980603): 1607-161910.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Most neuromodulators act on G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), an extensive protein family that triggers responses by engaging second messenger systems and ion channels. GPCR signals are relayed through an array of heterotrimeric G proteins comprised of 16 Gα subunits (2Milligan G. Kostenis E. Heterotrimeric G-proteins: a short history.Br. J.

Understanding the logic and mechanisms of this GPCR signaling coordination is critical yet poorly explored.

However, its coupling to individual G proteins and their role in propagating downstream signals has not been holistically examined, which limits our understanding of the MOR-GPR139 interplay. Here, we present the results of a systematic investigation of G protein–coupling selectivity of GPR139 and its role in signaling to downstream effectors. We also explore how GPR139 regulates MOR effects in a native neuronal setting. We establish that the key effects of GPR139 are mediated by Gq/11 signaling, which opposes the transmission of MOR signals at several intersecting points. Based on our findings, we propose that GPR139 “tunes” cellular responses to modulate opioid effects. To determine the signaling properties of GPR139, we first examined its complete G protein–coupling profile. We used a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) GPCR “fingerprinting” approach that permits the comprehensive study of unmodified receptors and unmodified Gα proteins to examine their coupling selectivity (22Masuho I. Ostrovskaya O. Kramer G.M. Jones C.D. Xie K. Martemyanov K.A. Distinct profiles of functional discrimination among G proteins determine the actions of G protein-coupled receptors.Sci. Signal. 2015; 8 (26628681): ra12310.1126/scisignal.aab4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this assay, Venus-tagged Gβ1γ2 was paired with the nanoluciferase-based sensor mas-GRK3CT. In the presence of a chosen Gα subunit, GPCR activation triggers dissociation of the G protein heterotrimer, generating the BRET signal (Fig. 1A). Using this strategy, we surveyed GPR139 activity on 15 Gα proteins (Fig. 1, B–F) and recorded both the maximum amplitude and initial activation kinetics for each G protein (Fig. 1, G and H). Interestingly, GPR139 could activate multiple G proteins with varying efficacies and kinetics. Within the Gi/o class, there were no strong preferences for individual subtypes (Fig. 1, B and C). Within the Gq/11 class, only Gq and G11 showed appreciable activation (Fig. 1D). Dose-response studies with representative members further confirmed similar potencies of GPR139 coupling to G11 and Go (Fig. S1). Gs and G12/13 classes were not activated by GPR139 (Fig. 1, E and F). Side-by-side comparison of maximum amplitudes (Fig. 1G) and the activation rates (Fig. 1H) across all classes of G proteins revealed a unique fingerprint-like profile of GPR139 coupling preferences. Together, these results indicate that GPR139 is a dual-specificity receptor capable of activating G proteins of the Gi/o and Gq/11 classes. Because GPR139 can activate multiple G protein classes, which can lead to different cellular responses, we examined the effectors engaged by GPR139. We used a panel of sensors to assay the effect of GPR139 activation on Ca2+ mobilization, ion channel regulation, and cAMP generation (Fig. 2A). When calcium levels were assayed with the BRET-based sensor CalFluxVTN (23Yang J. Cumberbatch D. Centanni S. Shi S.Q. Winder D. Webb D. Johnson C.H. Coupling optogenetic stimulation with NanoLuc-based luminescence (BRET) Ca2+ sensing.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27786307): 1326810.1038/ncomms13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we observed that GPR139 activation triggered a rapid and transient increase in BRET signal (Fig. 2B) suggestive of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and consistent with previous reports (14Matsuo A.

The application of the Gαq family–selective inhibitor YM-254890 completely blocked the response, indicating that the signal was mediated by Gαq-type proteins (Fig. 2B). Dose-response studies confirmed these observations and established an EC50 of 75 ± 29 nm (Fig. 2C), which is consistent with the EC50 for G11 activation in the G protein BRET assay (119 ± 32 nm) (Fig. S1). Next, we tested the influence of GPR139 on GIRK channels, which are activated by Gβγ released preferentially by Gi/o proteins (24Breitwieser G.E. Szabo G. Uncoupling of cardiac muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors from ion channels by a guanine nucleotide analogue.Nature. 1985; 317 (2413368): 538-54010.1038/317538a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 25Huang C.L.

We monitored GIRK channel opening kinetically by measuring thallium influx with an indicator dye (27Weaver C.D. Harden D. Dworetzky S.I. Robertson B. Knox R.J. A thallium-sensitive, fluorescence-based assay for detecting and characterizing potassium channel modulators in mammalian cells.J. Biomol. Screen. 2004; 9 (15634793): 671-67710.1177/1087057104268749Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The simultaneous addition of thallium and the GPR139 agonist JNJ-63533054 did not increase the rate of thallium influx compared with the slow, passive entry observed in cells without receptor (Fig. 2D). Dose-response studies quantifying changes in the slope of fluorescence showed no JNJ-63533054–induced changes at any concentration tested, confirming that GPR139 does not activate GIRK channels (Fig. 2E). Positive control experiments with MOR-transfected cells treated with morphine significantly increased the rate of GIRK channel activation, indicating adequate assay sensitivity (Fig. S2, A and B). Finally, we measured the effect of GPR139 on cAMP generation with a biosensor (Fig. 2F). Unexpectedly, we found that GPR139 stimulation dynamically increased cAMP levels. The increase occurred in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 41 ± 20 nm (Fig. 2G). GPR139 expression without agonist stimulation also increased the baseline cAMP levels, suggesting a high level of constitutive activity (Fig. S3). In summary, these results indicate that GPR139 coupling to Gq/11 propagates to engage the canonical Ca2+ release pathway. However, despite the efficient coupling of GPR139 to Gi/o and no coupling to Gs/olf, we observed no GIRK channel activation and paradoxical increase in cAMP production. The seemingly contradictory results between G protein coupling and downstream modulation of cAMP warranted further investigation. First, we tested whether GPR139 can also alter cAMP dynamics after treatment with the AC activator forskolin (FSK). Preincubation with JNJ-63533054 had no effect on cAMP dynamics in control cells (Fig. S4), but in GPR139-transfected cells, we detected a substantial enhancement of cAMP generation in both the amplitude and the initial activation rate (Fig. 3, A, C, and D). Intriguingly, several AC isoforms known to be expressed in HEK293T can be regulated by calcium generated downstream of Gq/11-coupled GPCRs (28Atwood B.K. Lopez J. Wager-Miller J. Mackie K.

To test the hypothesis that the GPR139-mediated changes in cAMP were driven by Gq/11 signaling, we blocked Gαq/11 with YM-254890 and found that it prevented GPR139-mediated augmentation of cAMP generation (Fig. 3B). The maximal response elicited by co-application of YM-254890 with JNJ-63533054 was decreased compared with cells treated with agonist alone and restored back to the control-treated condition (Fig. 3C). Moreover, YM-254890 also abolished the effect of JNJ-63533054 on the acceleration of cAMP production rate (Fig. 3D). We next addressed the inability to detect GIRK channel activation by GPR139 despite its coupling to Gi/o (25Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Interestingly, GIRK channels have also been shown to be impacted by Gq signaling acting via PIP2 and protein kinase C to inhibit channel activity (31Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W.

Thus, we hypothesized that GPR139 could negatively regulate GIRK channels via Gq to prevent channel opening in response to Gi/o activation. To test this hypothesis, we activated GIRK directly by agonist ML-297 (34Kaufmann K. Romaine I. Days E. Pascual C. Malik A. Yang L. Zou B. Du Y. Sliwoski G. Morrison R.D. Denton J. Niswender C.M. Daniels J.S. Sulikowski G.A. Xie X.S. et al.ML297 (VU0456810), the first potent and selective activator of the GIRK potassium channel, displays antiepileptic properties in mice.ACS Chem.

Indeed, expression of GPR139 inhibited GIRK channel opening to 52.3 ± 1.6% of control (Fig. 3, E and F). Overexpression of G11 enhanced this inhibition (Fig. 3, G and H). In contrast, blockade of Gq/11 by YM-254890 diminished the inhibitory effects of GPR139 (Fig. 3, G and H). These effects were selective for GPR139 as MOR had no impact on ML-297–mediated GIRK activation either upon overexpression of G11 or blockade of Gq/11 by YM-254890 (Fig. S5, A and B). We thus conclude that GPR139 negatively regulates GIRK channel opening by engaging the Gq/11 pathway, which predominates over stimulatory Gi/o engagement. We next sought to determine the relevance of GPR139-mediated Gq/11 signaling to counteracting MOR in the endogenous setting by examining spontaneous neuron firing in the medial habenula (mHb), where MOR and GPR139 are co-expressed (4Wang D.

Application of the MOR agonist DAMGO significantly dampened neuronal firing and reversed upon DAMGO washout (Fig. 4, A, B, and D). Pretreatment with JNJ-63533054 did not change the baseline firing rate (Fig. 4A) but completely blocked DAMGO's effects on firing (Fig. 4, A, C, and D). This effect of JNJ-63533054 was specific as it did not block DAMGO influence on firing in GPR139−/− mice (Fig. S6, A and B). Importantly, blockade of Gαq/11 with YM-254890 reversed the effects of the JNJ-63533054 and restored inhibition of firing in response to DAMGO (Fig. 4, A, C, and D). Taken together, these data indicate that GPR139-initiated Gq/11 signaling is sufficient to counteract MOR-mediated effects on mHb neuron firing.

In this study, we determined the prevalence and factors associated with antibacterial use in managing symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) in households in rural communities of Gulu district, northern Uganda. A cross-sectional study was conducted among households selected using multi-stage sampling. Data were collected through interviews with care-givers of children under five years, using a structured interviewer administered questionnaire. Out of the 856 children who had symptoms of ARIs, 515 (60.2%; CI: 54.5%-65.6%) were treated with antibacterials. The most commonly used antibacterials were amoxicillin (55.2%, n = 358), cotrimoxazole (15.4%, n = 100) and metronidazole (11.4%, n = 74). The determinants of antibacterial use included; getting treatment from a health facility (AOR: 1.85, CI: 1.34-2.56, P < 0.001), households located in peri-urban area (AOR: 2.54, CI: 1.34-4.84, P = 0.005), and a child having cough (AOR: 7.02, CI: 4.36-11.31, P < 0.001). The prevalence of antibacterial use among children under five years with symptoms of ARIs is high in communities of Gulu district, northern Uganda. Getting treatment from a health facility, if a household was located in a peri-urban area and having a cough are positive predictors of antibacterial use. There is need for targeted education on appropriate antibacterial use in rural communities and hospital settings where over prescription is most likely especially in treating symptoms of ARIs among children under five years."

Stress at baseline was related to both future positive mental health (negatively) and future depression (positively). Being male in this study was associated with increased future depression. Results hold across Germany, Russia, and China. Results support the conceptualization of positive and negative mental health as related, but independent dimensions across three cultures."
https://openalex.org/W3037567860,"Background Many patient organisations collaborate with drug companies, resulting in concerns about commercial agendas influencing patient advocacy. We contribute to an international body of knowledge on patient organisation-industry relations by considering payments reported in the industry’s centralised ‘collaboration database’ in Sweden. We also investigate possible commercial motives behind the funding by assessing its association with drug commercialisation. Methods Our primary data source were 1,337 payment reports from 2014–2018. After extraction and coding, we analysed the data descriptively, calculating the number, value and distribution of payments for various units of analysis, e.g. individual companies, diseases and payment goals. The association between drug commercialisation and patient organisation funding was assessed by, first, the concordance between leading companies marketing drugs in specific diseases and their funding of corresponding patient organisations and, second, the correlation between new drugs in broader condition areas and payments to corresponding patient organisations. Results 46 companies reported paying €6,449.224 (median €2,411; IQR €1,024–4,569) to 77 patient organisations, but ten companies provided 67% of the funding. Small payments dominated, many of which covered costs of events organised by patient organisations. An association existed between drug commercialisation and industry funding. Companies supported patient organisations in diseases linked to their drug portfolios, with the top 3 condition areas in terms of funding–cancer; endocrine, nutritional and metabolic disorders; and infectious and parasitic disorders–accounting for 63% of new drugs and 56% of the funding. Conclusion This study reveals close and widespread ties between patient organisations and drug companies. A relatively few number of companies dominated the funding landscape by supporting patient organisations in disease areas linked to their drug portfolios. This commercially motivated funding may contribute to inequalities in resource and influence between patient organisations. The association between drug commercialisation and industry funding is also worrying because of the therapeutic uncertainty of many new drugs. Our analysis benefited from the existence of a centralised database of payments–which should be adopted by other countries too–but databases should be downloadable in an analysable format to permit efficient and independent analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3038059995,"In the human food industry, the wheat-free market sales have increased over the years due to awareness of wheat gluten allergy and celiac disease. Sorghum is a gluten-free grain with great potential to address shortcomings in this market. The aim of this study was to evaluate the milling process and flour quality of one white and one red sorghum varieties and evaluate extrusion as a potential process to produce sorghum crisps. The white and red sorghum grains were milled into flour in three production cycles. Flour quality was evaluated by determination of nutritional composition, pasting, and thermal profile. Extrusion processing of white and red sorghum flour was performed, and macrostructure of final product was evaluated. The white and red sorghum used in this study yielded similar flour content (P > 0.05). Chemical analyses revealed a higher protein and lower starch content for white sorghum than red sorghum flour (P < 0.05); however, their pasting properties did not differ. Initial and peak gelatinization temperatures were higher (P < 0.05) for red sorghum compared to white sorghum flour. Regarding particle size, white sorghum flour presented lower d10 and d50 compared to the red sorghum flour (P < 0.05). However, these differences did not impact the extrusion conditions, and white and red sorghum crisps had similar macrostructure characteristics. In conclusion, although differences in nutritional, thermal, and particle size properties were observed between the sorghum flours used in this study, changes in extrusion parameters were not needed in order to produce sorghum crisps with similar characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3037705403,"Glaucoma is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form of glaucoma, is often associated with elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) due to the dysfunction of trabecular meshwork (TM) tissues. Currently, an ex vivo human anterior segment perfusion cultured system is widely used to study the effects of glaucoma factors and disease modifying drugs on physiological parameters like aqueous humor (AH) dynamics and IOP homeostasis. This system requires the use of freshly enucleated intact human eyes, which are sparsely available at very high cost. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using human donor corneoscleral segments for modeling morphological and biochemical changes associated with POAG. Among the number of corneas donated each year, many are deemed ineligible for transplantation due to stringent acceptance criteria. These ineligible corneoscleral segments were obtained from the Lions Eye Bank, Tampa, Florida. Each human donor anterior corneoscleral segment was dissected into four equal quadrants and cultured for 7 days by treating with the glaucoma factors dexamethasone (Dex) or recombinant transforming growth factor (TGF) β2 or transduced with lentiviral expression vectors containing wild type (WT) and mutant myocilin. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining analysis revealed that the TM structural integrity is maintained after 7 days in culture. Increased TUNEL positive TM cells were observed in corneoscleral quadrants treated with glaucoma factors compared to their respective controls. However, these TUNEL positive cells were mainly confined to the scleral region adjacent to the TM. Treatment of corneoscleral quadrants with Dex or TGFβ2 resulted in glaucomatous changes at the TM, which included increased extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Western blot analysis of the conditioned medium showed an increase in ECM (fibronectin and collagen IV) levels in Dex- or TGFβ2-treated samples compared to control. Lentiviral transduction of quadrants resulted in expression of WT and mutant myocilin in TM tissues. Western blot analysis of conditioned medium revealed decreased secretion of mutant myocilin compared to WT myocilin. Moreover, increased ECM deposition and ER stress induction was observed in the TM of mutant myocilin transduced quadrants. Our findings suggest that the ex-vivo cultured human corneoscleral segment model is cost-effective and can be used as a pre-screening tool to study the effects of glaucoma factors and anti-glaucoma therapeutics on the TM."
https://openalex.org/W3037595929,"In sheep, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementations in late gestation increases the growth of offspring; however, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of PUFA supplementation during early gestation. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in early gestation pregnant ewes on fatty acid concentration of fetal liver (FL) and fetal central nervous system (FCNS), and relative abundance of the mRNA for genes associated with transport and metabolism of fatty acids in FL and placenta. A total of 12 ewes, block for stage of gestation were fed a diet containing 1.6% (dry matter basis) monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) or EPA+DHA during the first 45 days of gestation. A cesarean section was conducted on day 45 of gestation to collect placenta (caruncle and cotyledon), FL, and FCNS. Relative abundance of mRNA in FL and FCNS and fatty acid concentration were analyzed using a 2x2 factorial arrangement of treatments considering fatty acid supplementation and tissue as the main factors. Concentrations of C18:1 isomers increase (P < 0.05) in FL and FCNS with MUFA supplementation; the FL and FCNS had a greater concentration of C20:3(n-6), C20:3(n-3), C22:1, C22:5 and C22:6 (P < 0.05) with EPA+DHA supplementation. In FL, the relative abundance of LPL mRNA was greater (P = 0.02) as a result of MUFA supplementation. In placenta, there was a FA x tissue interaction for relative abundance of DNMT3b and FFAR-4 mRNA (P < 0.05). Fetus from MUFA-supplemented dams had a greater relative abundance of FABP-4 mRNA (P < 0.05). Results indicate supplementation with EPA+DHA during early gestation increases the total EPA and DHA in FL. For the placenta, EPA+DHA supplementation led to an increase in the relative abundance of lipid mRNA for transport genes."
https://openalex.org/W3036003870,"The cancer risk of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has not been well documented in southern Europe. This study aimed to evaluate the overall pattern of cancer risk among patients with IBD in Friuli Venezia Giulia, northeastern Italy. A population-based cohort study was performed through a record linkage between local healthcare databases and the cancer registry (1995-2013). We identified 3664 IBD patients aged 18-84 years, including 2358 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 1306 with Crohn's disease (CD). Sex- and age-standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare the cancer incidence of IBD patients with the general population. The cumulative cancer risk among IBD patients reached about 10% after 10 years of follow-up. A total of 246 cancers occurred among UC patients (SIR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.92-1.19), and 141 among CD patients (SIR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.01-1.41). As compared with the general population, no increased risk of colorectal cancers was observed for either UC or CD patients, whereas the risk of anal cancer was significantly elevated among UC patients (SIR = 6.03, 95% CI: 1.24-17.60). Increased risks were seen for specific extra-intestinal cancers, including corpus uteri (SIR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.07-5.50) and kidney (SIR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.03-3.69) among UC patients; thyroid (SIR = 5.58, 95% CI: 2.41-11.00) and skin non-melanoma (SIR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.32-2.55) among CD patients. This population-based study showed that both UC and CD patients had a colorectal cancer risk similar to that of the general population. However, they were at a higher risk of developing certain extra-intestinal cancer types. Although detection biases cannot be excluded, the study findings pointed to a role of long-standing exposures to immunosuppressive therapies, underlying disease status, as well as the interactions with lifestyle factors. Our findings lent additional support to the need for monitoring the cancer burden in this at-risk population."
https://openalex.org/W3037667413,"Cystic kidney diseases are a very heterogeneous group of chronic kidney diseases. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical and ultrasound characteristics and the final diagnosis is often difficult to be made. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) may help the clinicians to find the correct final diagnosis. The aim of our study was to test the diagnostic yield of NGS and its ability to improve the diagnosis precision in a heterogeneous group of children with cystic kidney diseases. Next-generation sequencing of genes responsible for the formation of cystic kidneys was performed in 31 unrelated patients with various clinically diagnosed cystic kidney diseases gathered at the Department of Pediatrics of Motol University Hospital in Prague between 2013 and 2018. The underlying pathogenic variants were detected in 71% of patients (n = 22), no or only one (in case of autosomal recessive inheritance) pathogenic variant was found in 29% of patients (n = 9). The result of NGS correlated with the clinical diagnosis made before the NGS in 55% of patients (n = 17), in the remaining 14 children (45%) the result of NGS revealed another type of cystic kidney disease that was suspected clinically before or did not find causal mutation in suspected genes. The most common unexpected findings were variants in nephronophthisis (NPHP) genes in children with clinically suspected autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD, n = 4). Overall, 24 pathogenic or probably pathogenic variants were detected in the PKHD1 gene, 8 variants in the TMEM67 gene, 4 variants in the PKD1 gene, 2 variants in the HNF1B gene and 2 variants in BBS1 and NPHP1 genes, respectively. NGS is a valuable tool in the diagnostics of various forms of cystic kidney diseases. Its results changed the clinically based diagnoses in 16% (n = 5) of the children."
https://openalex.org/W3037873119,"To determine the prevalence of vascular complications among inpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and factors independently associated with vascular complications in a tertiary care department in Ningbo, China, the authors conducted a cross-sectional study using an existing computerised medical records database. A total of 3370 adult patients with T2DM were admitted to this tertiary care department for the first time between 2012 and 2017. Patients were categorised as those (1) with at least one vascular complication, (2) with at least one microvascular complication, and (3) with at least one macrovascular complication. Over 5 years, the prevalence of vascular, microvascular, and macrovascular complications among inpatients with T2DM was 73.2%, 57.5%, and 51.4%, respectively. The odds of vascular, microvascular, and macrovascular complications increased with age and were higher in patients with hypertension. The odds of vascular and microvascular complications were higher in single, divorced, or widowed patients, patients with T2DM for a long time, and patients on advanced T2DM therapeutic regimen. The odds of vascular and macrovascular complications were lower in women. The odds of microvascular complications decreased with education. The odds of macrovascular complications were higher in smokers. In conclusion, in the tertiary care department, more than half of inpatients with T2DM had vascular complications, and factors independently associated with vascular complications were identified. The study findings could be used in future interventional studies to prevent and manage vascular complications among these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3036657921,"Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are vital to coral reefs worldwide, providing structural integrity and inducing the settlement of important invertebrate larvae. CCA are known to be impacted by changes in their environment, both during early development and adulthood. However, long-term studies on either life history stage are lacking in the literature, therefore not allowing time to explore the acclimatory or potential adaptive responses of CCA to future global change scenarios. Here, we exposed a widely distributed, slow growing, species of CCA, Sporolithon cf. durum, to elevated temperature and pCO2 for five months and their first set of offspring (F1) for eleven weeks. Survival, reproductive output, and metabolic rate were measured in adult S. cf. durum, and survival and growth were measured in the F1 generation. Adult S. cf. durum experienced 0% mortality across treatments and reduced their O2 production after five months exposure to global stressors, indicating a possible expression of plasticity. In contrast, the combined stressors of elevated temperature and pCO2 resulted in 50% higher mortality and 61% lower growth on germlings. On the other hand, under the independent elevated pCO2 treatment, germling growth was higher than all other treatments. These results show the robustness and plasticity of S. cf. durum adults, indicating the potential for them to acclimate to increased temperature and pCO2. However, the germlings of this species are highly sensitive to global stressors and this could negatively impact this species in future oceans, and ultimately the structure and stability of coral reefs."

Objectives To evaluate how responsible the ethno-religious origins are, for the prevalence of trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in displaced Iraqi asylum-seekers and refugees residing in the Iraqi Kurdistan region. Methods Structured interviews with a cross-sectional sample of 150 individuals, comprised of three self-identified ethno-religious groups (50 participants in each): Christians, Muslims, and Yazidis. Results 100% prevalence of trauma exposure and 48.7% of current PTSD among refugees, 70% PTSD rate of Yazidi participants, which is significantly higher (p < 0.01) compared to 44% of Muslim participants and 32% of Christian participants. These findings were corroborated using the self-rated PTSD, DSM-5 Checklist, with more severe PTSD symptom scores (p < 0.001) obtained among Yazidis (43.1; 19.7), compared to Muslims (31.3; 20.1) and Christians (29.3; 17.8).

https://openalex.org/W3036400606,"Seasonal exposures influence human health and development. The placenta, as a mediator of the maternal and fetal systems and a regulator of development, is an ideal tissue to understand the biological pathways underlying relationships between season of birth and later life health outcomes. Here, we conducted a differential expression (DE) analysis of season of birth in full-term human placental tissue to evaluate whether the placenta may be influenced by seasonal cues. Of the analyzed transcripts, 583 displayed DE between summer and winter births (False Discovery Rate [FDR] q < .05); among these, BHLHE40, MIR210HG, and HILPDA had increased expression among winter births (Bonferroni P < .05). Enrichment analyses of the seasonally variant genes between summer and winter births indicated overrepresentation of transcription factors HIF1A, VDR, and CLOCK, among others, and of GO term pathways related to ribosomal activity and infection. Additionally, a cosinor analysis found rhythmic expression for approximately 11.9% of all 17 664 analyzed placental transcripts. These results suggest that the placenta responds to seasonal cues and add to the growing body of evidence that the placenta acts as a peripheral clock, which may provide a molecular explanation for the extensive associations between season of birth and health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3037169822,"Adenylyl cyclases (AC) are essential for the normal and pathophysiological response of many cells. In cardiomyocytes, the predominant AC isoforms are AC5 and AC6. Specific AC5 inhibition was suggested as an option for the treatment of heart failure potentially advantageous over β-blockers. We previously reported an interaction between the calcium-binding protein annexin A4 (ANXA4) and AC5 in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and an inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated whether ANXA4 is able to differentiate between AC5 and AC6. In transfected HEK293 cells, ANXA4 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with AC5 and not with AC6, via its N-terminal domain. Both ANXA4 and a peptide comprising the ANXA4 N-terminal sequence (A4N1-22) decreased the cAMP production in AC5 and not in AC6 expressing cells. In line with ACs inhibition, in myocytes from ANXA4-deficient mice, β-adrenoceptor (βAR) stimulation led to a higher increase of the L-type calcium current (ICaL) and to an excessive action potential duration (APD) prolongation as compared to wild-type cardiomyocytes. This enhanced response was reversed in the presence of A4N1-22 peptide likely via specific AC5 inhibition. We conclude that via the N-terminal domain ANXA4 inhibits AC5 not AC6, and that A4N1-22 as a specific AC5 inhibitor could serve as a novel therapeutic tool for the treatment of AC5-linked diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3037374687,"Roof greening is an important national policy for maintaining the hydrological balance in China; however, plant growth is limited by drought stress. This study aims to identify strong drought resistant plant species for roof greening from ten common species: Paeonia lactiflora, Hemerocallis dumortieri, Meehania urticifolia, Iris lactea var. chinensis, Hylotelephium erythrostictum, Sedum lineare, Iris germanica, Cosmos bipinnata, Hosta plantaginea, and Dianthus barbatus. By controlling the soil relative water content (RWC), we designed three treatments: moderate drought stress (40±2% < RWC < 45±2%), severe drought stress (RWC < 30±2%) and well-watered control (RWC > 75±2%). After the seedlings were provided different levels of water, their membrane permeability (MP), chlorophyll concentration (Chl), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity were measured. Finally, the membership function method was used to assess the drought resistance of these species. The results showed that C. bipinnata and M. urticifolia were not suitable for moderate or severe drought stress and did not survive. The other species presented variations in physiological and biochemical parameters. The MP of He. dumortieri, I. lactea and Ho. plantaginea showed minor changes between the well-watered control and drought stress. Most of the species showed reduced SOD activity under moderate drought stress but increased activity under severe stress. All of the plant species showed decreases in the protective enzymes POD and APX with increasing drought stress. The membership function method was applied to calculate the plant species' drought resistance, and the following order of priority of the roof-greening plant species was suggested: He. dumortieri > I. germanica > I. lactea > D. barbatus > Hy. erythrostictum > S. lineare > Ho. plantaginea > P. lactiflora."
https://openalex.org/W3037576035,"In an era of renewed commitment to accelerate the declines in Tuberculosis (TB) incidence and mortality, there is the need for National Tuberculosis Programmes (NTPs) to monitor trends in key indicators across a geographical location and to provide reliable data for direct measurement of TB incidence and mortality. In this context, we explored the trends of TB case detection, mortality and HIV co-infection, and examined the predictors of TB deaths in Ten districts of the Volta region of Ghana.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all TB cases registered from 2013 to 2017 in 10 districts of the Volta Region of Ghana. Case detection rate (CDR) was computed as the ratio of the number of new and relapse TB case notified to NTP to the number of estimated incident TB cases in a given year. Case fatality rates were estimated using data from 2012-2016 cohort of TB patients. Simple and multiple logistic regression were used to identify predictors of TB deaths with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals estimated.Overall, there were 3,735 new and relapse TB patients who commenced anti-TB treatment during the period, representing the case detection rate of 40.1% with district variations. The CDR remained stable during the 5 years. Of the total cases, HIV status was documented for 3,144 (84.2%), among whom, 712 (22.6%) were HIV positive. The TB/HIV co-infection was more prevalent among children under 15 years of age (30.1%), males (30.6%), treatment after lost to follow-up patients (33.3%), and smear-negative pulmonary TB patients (29.1%). The prevalence of TB/HIV co-infection did not significantly change over the years. The overall case fatality rate was 13% (n = 486), with considerable variation among HIV-positives and HIV-negative TB patients (21.8% and 11% respectively) (p<0.001) and among districts. TB/HIV co-infection, sputum smear-negative pulmonary TB and district of anti-TB treatment predicted TB mortality.TB case detection rate was low and remained stable during the study period, whereas co-infection with HIV and mortality rates were quite high, indicating the need for feasible strategies such as active case finding to improve case detection, and improved case management to reduce mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3036224473,"Background Due to improved treatment, there is an increasing focus on the reproductive potential of survivors of childhood cancer. Cytotoxic chemotherapy accelerates the decline in the number of primordial follicles within the mammalian ovary at all ages, but effects on the developmental potential of remaining oocytes following prepubertal cancer treatment are unclear. Objectives To investigate whether cyclophosphamide (CY) exposure in the prepubertal period in female mice influences ovarian function and the functional competence of oocytes in adulthood. Methods This study used Swiss albino mice as the experimental model. Female mice were treated with 200 mg/kg CY on either postnatal day 14 (CY14), 21 (CY21) or 28 (CY28) i.e at a prepubertal and 2 young postpubertal ages. At 14 weeks of life, ovarian function, functional competence of oocytes, and embryo quality were assessed. Results The number of primordial follicles decreased significantly in CY14 and CY21 groups compared to control (p < 0.01). The number of oocytes from superovulated was 8.5 ± 1.4, 24.1 ± 2.9 and 26.8 ± 2.1 in CY14, CY21 and CY28 respectively which was significantly lower than control (50.2 ± 3.2; p < 0.001). In vitro culture of CY14 embryos demonstrated only 55.4% blastocyst formation (p < 0.0001) and reduced ability of inner cell mass (ICM) to proliferate in vitro (p < 0.05) at 120 and 216 h post insemination respectively. On the other hand, ICM proliferation was unaltered in 2 young postpubertal ages. Conclusion Our results indicate long-term effects on the developmental competence of oocytes exposed to CY in early but not adult life. These data provide a mechanism whereby long-term fertility can be impaired after chemotherapy exposure, despite the continuing presence of follicles within the ovary, and support the need for fertility preservation in prepubertal girls before alkylating agent exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3037222130,"Post-ictal emergence of slow wave EEG (electroencephalogram) activity and burst-suppression has been associated with the therapeutic effects of the electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), indicating that mere “cerebral silence” may elicit antidepressant actions. Indeed, brief exposures to burst-suppressing anesthesia has been reported to elicit antidepressant effects in a subset of patients, and produce behavioral and molecular alterations, such as increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), connected with antidepressant responses in rodents. Here, we have further tested the cerebral silence hypothesis by determining whether repeated exposures to isoflurane anesthesia reduce depressive-like symptoms or influence BDNF expression in male Wistar outbred rats (Crl:WI(Han)) subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS), a model which is responsive to repeated electroconvulsive shocks (ECS, a model of ECT). Stress-susceptible, stress-resilient, and unstressed rats were exposed to 5 doses of isoflurane over a 15-day time period, with administrations occurring every third day. Isoflurane dosing is known to reliably produce rapid EEG burst-suppression (4% induction, 2% maintenance; 15 min). Antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of isoflurane were assessed after the first, third, and fifth drug exposure by measuring sucrose consumption, as well as performance on the open field and the elevated plus maze tasks. Tissue samples from the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were collected, and levels of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) protein were assessed. We find that isoflurane anesthesia had no impact on the behavior of stress-resilient or anhedonic rats in selected tests; findings which were consistent—perhaps inherently related—with unchanged levels of BDNF."

The present study was carried out to delineate the underlying molecular mechanisms of immunological non-responsiveness to HIV therapy.We conducted microarray-based whole gene expression profiles of 30 subjects infected with HIV-1 subtype C, in peripheral blood to discern the signature genes associated with immunological non-responsiveness. After a thorough analysis and comparison of gene-expression profiles, microarray data was validated via qRT-PCR approach.Overall, we found 10 genes significantly up-regulated and 60 genes down-regulated (≥2-fold change) in immunological non-responders as compared to responders. Based on these results and pathway analysis of the protein-protein interaction, 20 genes were shortlisted for validation in human infected cases. We found statistically significant differences in expression levels of twelve genes IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-7R, TNF-α, FoxP3, PDCD5, COX7B, SOCS1, SOCS3, RPL9, RPL23, and LRRN3 respectively among immunological non-responders compared to therapy responders, confirming their an intimate relationship with immunological responsiveness to therapy.Altogether, microarray and qRT-PCR validation results indicated that the aberrant expression of key genes involved in the regulation of T cell homeostasis, immune activation, inflammatory cytokine production, apoptosis, and immune-regulatory processes are possibly associated with immunological non-responsiveness in HIV-1 C infected individuals on ART."

Our objective was to assess of surrogates of social value of Phase 1 trials performed in pediatric oncology: rates of approval of tested interventions, transition to further phases of testing and citation in subsequent primary research reports.We performed an analysis on a subset of eligible trials included in a previous meta-analysis. That study systematically searched EMBASE and PubMed for small sample size, non-randomized, dose escalation pediatric cancer Phase 1 studies of any malignancy, assessing chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy and looked at risk and benefit. The current analysis assessed all studies in that review published between January 1st 2004 and December 31st 2013 for predictors of social value. This time range allowed for at least five years of subsequent development activity. Sources of data included FDA and EMA medicine databases (for approval), ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trials Register (for transition) and Google Scholar (for citation).One hundred thirty-nine trials enrolling 3814 patients met the eligibility criteria. Seven trials (5%) led to drugs being registered for pediatric use in therapy of cancer. Fifty-two (37%) transitioned to later phases of pediatric oncology trials according to ClinicalTrials.gov and/or EU Register. Over 90% of trials were cited by at least one subsequent primary research report or systematic review. Most of the citations were preclinical studies.Our analysis shows that treatments tested in pediatric Phase 1 trials in oncology have low rates of regulatory approval. However, a large proportion of Phase 1 trials inform further testing and development of tested interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3035874028,"Common mental disorders (CMD) among mothers cause disability, negatively affect child development, and have high long-term economic costs. Little is known about how factors across multiple life dimensions, modeled together, are differentially related to maternal mental health in high poverty contexts. Further, there is limited evidence on determinants of CMD in areas where self-help groups (SHGs) exist to promote women's wellbeing. Filling this evidence gap is important given the high prevalence of CMD and the rapid expansion of SHGs in rural India. Cross-sectional data were collected from 1644 mother-infant pairs living in disadvantaged rural villages across five Indian states-Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh-surveyed in the Women Improving Nutrition through Group-based Strategies study. CMD were assessed using the 20-item Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ). We examined 31 factors across four life dimensions: work (work type, time spent in labor, domestic and caretaking activities), agency (SHG membership, decision-making, gender attitudes), health/nutrition (underweight, fertility, diet diversity, child illness), and household/environment (dependency ratio, wealth, food security, shocks, water, sanitation). Survey-adjusted multivariate logistic and ordinary least squares regression models were fit to examine predictors of CMD or SRQ score. On average, mothers were 26 (range 18-46) years old and their children were 15 (range 6-24) months old. CMD defined as ≥ 8 positive SRQ responses were reported by 262 women (16%). Protective factors included being engaged in agricultural labor as a main occupation relative to being a housewife (AOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.10-0.32), more time working (0.85, 0.77-0.93), higher decision-making (0.33, 0.16-0.69), SHG membership (0.73, 0.56-0.96), and having an improved toilet (0.49, 0.33-0.72). Risk factors included food insecurity (1.13, 1.07-1.20) and shocks to non-farm livelihoods (2.04, 1.10-3.78). Practitioners and policymakers should aim to improve food security, economic wellbeing and social capital, such as that created through SHG membership, to improve maternal mental health. Future research should aim to understand why working outside the home, albeit in agricultural work, appears to protect maternal mental health in this context."

A 3-rounds e-Delphi method was utilized to develop a consensual understanding of the dimensions of sport-injury related growth. A panel of 24 psychology of sport injury experts participated in the process. The final list of items obtained was subjected to conventional content analysis to identify general themes. The process led to the development of a 5-dimension model capable of describing athletes’ experiences of personal growth following a severe sports-related injury: personal strength, improved social life, health benefits, sport benefits, and social support and recognition. The domains of sport-injury related growth identified here are consistent with growth-domains identified in previous personal growth literature. However, they also highlight the importance of contextualizing the experience of growth. We have captured key elements of sport-injury related growth, domains that can be used as the basis for further psychometric testing and for further interventions to increase adjustment and well-being during the rehabilitation process."
https://openalex.org/W3037649887,"Automated colony counting methods have long been known in Microbiology. Numerous methods for automated image analysis have been described and a wide range of commercial products exists. Known advantages are saving cost by reducing enumeration time, automatic documentation, reproducibility, and operator independence. Still, even today the realization of all advantages of automated image analysis makes it necessary to either invest in an expensive, high performance commercial system, or to acquire expert knowledge in image processing. This is a considerable obstacle for many laboratories, and the reason why manual colony counting is still done frequently. This article describes an easy to apply automatic colony counting system–including suggestions for sample preparation–that can be put into operation with basic knowledge of image processing and low budget."
https://openalex.org/W3037824963,"Objectives Timely delivery of fetal growth restriction (FGR) is important in reducing stillbirth. However, targeted earlier delivery of FGR preferentially removes smaller babies from later gestations, thereby right-shifting the distribution of birthweights at term. This artificially increases the birthweight cutoffs defining the lower centiles and redefines normally grown babies as small by population-based birthweight centiles. Our objective was to compare updated Australian national population-based birthweight centile charts over time with the prescriptive INTERGROWTH-21st standard. Methods A retrospective descriptive study of all singleton births ≥34 weeks’ gestation in Victoria, Australia in five two-year epochs: 1983–84, 1993–94, 2003–04, 2013–14, and 2016–17. The birthweight cutoffs defining the 3rd and 10th centile from three Australian national population-based birthweight centile charts, for births in 1991–1994, in 1998–2007, and 2004–2013 respectively, were applied to each epoch to calculate the proportion of babies with birthweight <3rd and <10th centile. The same analysis was done using the INTERGROWTH-21st birthweight standard. To assess change over gestation, proportions were also calculated at preterm, early term and late term gestations. Results From 1983–84 to 2016–17, the proportion of babies with birthweight <3rd fell across all birthweight centile charts, from 3.1% to 1.7% using the oldest Australian chart, from 3.9% to 1.9% using the second oldest Australian chart, from 4.3% to 2.2% using the most recent Australian chart, and from 2.0% to 0.9% using the INTERGROWTH-21st standard. A similar effect was evident for the <10th centile. The effect was most obvious at term gestations. Updating the Australian population birthweight chart progressively right-shifted the birthweight distribution, changing the definition of small over time. The birthweight distribution of INTERGROWTH-21st was left-shifted compared to the Australian charts. Conclusions Locally-derived population-based birthweight centiles are better for clinical audit of care but should not be updated. Prescriptive birthweight standards are less useful in defining ‘small’ due to their significant left-shift."
https://openalex.org/W3038081823,"The reduction and simplification of grasslands has led to the decline of numerous species of grassland fauna, particularly grassland-obligate birds. Prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus spp.) are an example of obligate grassland birds that have declined throughout most of their distribution and are species of conservation concern. Pyric herbivory has been suggested as a land management strategy for enhancing prairie-chicken habitat and stabilizing declining population trends. We assessed differences in vegetation structure created by pyric herbivory compared to fire-only treatments to determine whether pyric herbivory increased habitat heterogeneity for prairie-chickens, spatially or temporally. Our study was performed at four sites in the southern Great Plains, all within the current or historic distribution of either lesser (T. pallidicinctus), greater (T. cupido), or Attwater's (T. cupido attwateri) prairie-chickens. Key vegetation characteristics of grass cover and vegetation height in pyric herbivory and fire-only treatments were within the recommended range of values for prairie-chickens during their distinct life history stages. However, patches managed via pyric herbivory provided approximately 5% more forb cover than fire-only treatments for almost 30 months post-fire. Additionally, pyric herbivory extended the length of time bare ground was present after fires. Pyric herbivory also reduced vegetation height and biomass, with mean vegetation height in pyric herbivory treatments lagging behind fire-only treatments by approximately 15 months. Canopy cover in fire-only treatments exceeded levels recommended for prairie-chicken young within 12 months post-fire. However, canopy cover in pyric herbivory treatments never exceeded the maximum recommended levels. Overall, it appears that pyric herbivory improves vegetation characteristics reported as critical to prairie-chicken reproduction. Based on our results, we suggest pyric herbivory as a viable management technique to promote prairie-chicken habitat in the southern Great Plains, while still accommodating livestock production."
https://openalex.org/W3037318455,"The challenges of supporting the end-of-life preferences of patients and their families have often been attributed to poor understanding of the patient's condition. Understanding how physicians, as patients, communicate their end-of-life care preferences to their families may inform shared decision making at end of life.The purpose of this study was to understand what matters to families of physicians when decision making with and for a physician who is approaching the end of life.Cross-sectional qualitative design.We conducted interviews with family members of deceased physicians.We analyzed the data using the constant comparison method to identify themes.Family members (N = 26) rarely were unclear about the treatment preferences of physicians who died. Three overarching themes emerged about what matters most to physicians' families: (1) honoring preferences for the context of end-of-life care; (2) supporting the patient's control and dignity in care; and, (3) developing a shared understanding of preferences. Families struggled to make decisions and provide the care needed by the physicians at the end of life, often encountering significant challenges from the healthcare system.Even when disease and prognosis are well understood as in this group of physicians, families still experienced difficulties in end-of-life decision making. These findings highlight the need to specifically address preferences for caregiver, care setting and symptom management in shared end-of-life decision making conversations with patients and families."
https://openalex.org/W3037797478,"The current paradigm for biomedical research and drug testing postulates that in vitro and in silico data inform animal studies that will subsequently inform human studies. Recent evidence points out that animal studies have made a poor contribution to current knowledge of Major Depressive Disorder, whereas the contribution of in vitro and in silico studies to animal studies- within this research area- is yet to be properly quantified. This quantification is important since biomedical research and drug discovery and development includes two steps of knowledge transferability and we need to evaluate the effectiveness of both in order to properly implement 3R principles (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement). Here, we used the citation tracking facility within Web of Science to locate citations of original research papers on in vitro and in silico related to MDD published identified in PubMed by relevant search terms. 67 publications describing target papers were located. Both in vitro and in silico papers are more cited by human medical papers than by animal papers. The results suggest that, at least concerning MDD research, the current two steps of knowledge transferability are not being followed, indicating a poor compliance with the 3R principles."
https://openalex.org/W4235027709,"Nitrate (NO3-), through its conversion to nitrite (NO2-) and nitric oxide, has been shown to increase exercise tolerance in healthy younger adults and older diseased patients. Nitrate's effect in well-trained middle to older-aged adults has not been studied. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of a NO3- rich beverage on submaximal constant work rate exercise time in well-trained middle to older-aged adults.This was a randomized controlled cross-over trial with 15 well-trained middle to older-aged adults, 41-64 year-old, who received one of two treatments (NO3- rich beverage then placebo or placebo then NO3- rich beverage), after which an exercise test at 75 percent of the subject's maximal work rate was completed.The NO3- rich beverage increased plasma NO3- and NO2- levels by 260 μM and 0.47 μM, respectively (p<0.001). Exercise time was not significantly different (p = 0.31) between the NO3- rich versus placebo conditions (1130±151 vs 1060±132 sec, respectively). Changes in exercise time between the two conditions ranged from a 55% improvement to a 40% decrease with the NO3- rich beverage. Oxygen consumption and rating of perceived exertion were not significantly different between the two conditions.In middle to older-aged well-trained adults, NO3- supplementation has non-significant, albeit highly variable, effects on exercise tolerance.

https://openalex.org/W3036116105,"Viral infections complicated by a bacterial infection are typically referred to as coinfections or superinfections. Streptococcus pyogenes, the group A streptococcus (GAS), is not the most common bacteria associated with influenza A virus (IAV) superinfections but did cause significant mortality during the 2009 influenza pandemic even though all isolates are susceptible to penicillin. One approach to improve the outcome of these infections is to use passive immunization targeting GAS. To test this idea, we assessed the efficacy of passive immunotherapy using antisera against either the streptococcal M protein or streptolysin O (SLO) in a murine model of IAV-GAS superinfection. Prophylactic treatment of mice with antiserum to either SLO or the M protein decreased morbidity compared to mice treated with non-immune sera; however, neither significantly decreased mortality. Therapeutic use of antisera to SLO decreased morbidity compared to mice treated with non-immune sera but neither antisera significantly reduced mortality. Overall, the results suggest that further development of antibodies targeting the M protein or SLO may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of invasive GAS diseases, including IAV-GAS superinfections, which may be particularly important during influenza pandemics."

https://openalex.org/W3037322269,"Individual growth data are useful in assessing relative habitat quality, but this approach is less common when evaluating the efficacy of habitat restoration. Furthermore, available models describing growth are infrequently combined with computational approaches capable of handling large data sets. We apply a mechanistic model to evaluate whether selection of restored habitat can affect individual growth. We used mark-recapture to collect size and growth data on sub-yearling Chinook salmon and steelhead in restored and unrestored habitat in five sampling years (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2016). Modeling strategies differed for the two species: For Chinook, we compared growth patterns of individuals recaptured in restored habitat over 15-60 d with those not recaptured regardless of initial habitat at marking. For steelhead, we had enough recaptured fish in each habitat type to use the model to directly compare habitats. The model generated spatially explicit growth parameters describing size of fish over the growing season in restored vs. unrestored habitat. Model parameters showed benefits of restoration for both species, but that varied by year and time of season, consistent with known patterns of habitat partitioning among them. The model was also supported by direct measurement of growth rates in steelhead and by known patterns of spatio-temporal partitioning of habitat between these two species. Model parameters described not only the rate of growth, but the timing of size increases, and is spatially explicit, accounting for habitat differences, making it widely applicable across taxa. The model usually supported data on density differences among habitat types in Chinook, but only in a couple of cases in steelhead. Modeling growth can thus prevent overconfidence in distributional data, which are commonly used as the metric of restoration success."
https://openalex.org/W3037744895,"Lasso peptides are unique in that the tail of the lasso peptide threads through its macrolactam ring. The unusual structure and biological activity of lasso peptides have generated increased interest from the scientific community in recent years. Because of this, many new types of lasso peptides have been discovered. These peptides can be synthesized by microorganisms efficiently, and yet, their chemical assembly is challenging. Herein, we investigated the possibility of high pressure inducing the cyclization of linear precursors of lasso peptides. Unlike other molecules like rotaxanes which mechanically interlock at high pressure, the threaded lasso peptides did not form, even at pressures the high pressure up to 14 000 kbar."
https://openalex.org/W3037884481,"High postprandial blood glucose levels are associated with increased mortality, cardiovascular events and development of diabetes in the general population. Interventions targeting postprandial glucose have been shown to prevent both cardiovascular events and diabetes. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a novel nutritional supplement targeting postprandial glucose excursions in non-diabetic adults. Sixty overweight healthy male and female participants were recruited at two centers and randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. The supplement, a water-based drink containing 2.6g of amino acids (L-Leucine, L-Threonine, L-Lysine Monohydrochloride, L-Isoleucine, L-Valine) and 250 mcg of chromium picolinate, was consumed with a standardized carbohydrate-rich meal. The primary endpoint was the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for venous blood glucose from 0 to 120 minutes. Secondary endpoints included glucose iAUC 0–180 minutes and the maximum glucose concentration (Cmax), for both venous and capillary blood glucose. In the intention-to-treat-analysis (n = 60) the supplement resulted in a decreased venous blood glucose iAUC0-120min compared to placebo, mean (SE) of 68.7 (6.6) versus 52.2 (6.8) respectively, a difference of -16.5 mmol/L•min (95% CI -3.1 to -30.0, p = 0.017). The Cmax for venous blood glucose for the supplement and placebo were 6.45 (0.12) versus 6.10 (<0.12), respectively, a difference of -0.35 mmol/L (95% CI -0.17 to -0.53, p<0.001). In the per protocol-analysis (n = 48), the supplement resulted in a decreased Cmax compared to placebo from 6.42 (0.14) to 6.12 (0.14), a difference of -0.29 mmol/L (95% CI -0.12 to -0.47, p = 0.002). No significant differences in capillary blood glucose were found, as measured by regular bed-side glucometers. The nutritional supplement drink containing amino acids and chromium improves the postprandial glucose homeostasis in overweight adults without diabetes. Future studies should clarify, whether regular consumption of the supplement improves markers of disease or could play a role in a diet aiming at preventing the development of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3037559531,"Many studies have shown that Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of both community onset and hospital onset bloodstream infections. However, relatively little is known about the occurrence and outcome of S. aureus bacteremia in sub-Saharan Africa. A previous report indicated that S. aureus accounts for 16% of community onset and 6% of hospital onset bloodstream infections at Aga Khan University Hospital Nairobi (AKUHN). Data about the etiology of S. aureus bacteremia in sub-Saharan Africa will help optimize recognition and treatment. This study was performed in order to understand the etiologies and risk factors for S. aureus bacteremia in a sub-Saharan location.A review of the electronic record of laboratory results from September 2010 through December 2018 identified 201 patients seen at AKUHN with S. aureus bacteremia. The source and/or focus of infection was identified and in-hospital mortality was determined. Cases with bacteremia after three days of hospitalization were considered hospital acquired. Community onset cases were divided into community acquired and health care associated.Most cases (71%; 143/201) were community onset, but only 41% (83/201) of these cases were community acquired. The most commonly identified foci of infection for community acquired bacteremia were musculoskeletal (25%; 21/83) and skin and soft tissue (24%; 20/83). The majority of health care associated (70%; 40/57) and hospital acquired cases (74%; 43/58) were associated with invasive vascular devices, with peripheral IVs being the most common for hospital acquired and dialysis catheters being the most common for health care associated infections. In-hospital mortality rates were 23% (19/83) for community acquired, 19% (11/57) for health care associated and 33% (19/58) for hospital acquired infections.Invasive vascular devices were associated with a substantial portion of cases of S. aureus bacteremia and provide an important target for infection control efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3037001688,"Despite the good mechanical properties of natural fibre composites, their use in load-bearing components is still limited, which may be due to lack of knowledge and confidence in calculating the performance of the composites by mechanical models. The present study is providing an experimental evaluation of stiffness predictions of multiaxial flax fibre composite by classical laminate theory (CLT). The experimental base is (i) multiaxial flax fibre composites fabricated with two types of biaxial non-crimp fabrics, having a nominal yarn orientation of ±45°, and (ii) uniaxial flax fibre composites fabricated with the same flax yarn as used in the fabrics. The fabricated composites are characterised by volumetric composition, yarn orientation and tensile properties. A fast and easy operational Fast Fibre Orientation (FFO) method is developed to determine the actual yarn orientation in fabrics and composites. It is demonstrated that the FFO method is a robust method, giving repeatable results for yarn orientations, and it can be used both on fabrics and composites. CLT predictions of stiffness of the multiaxial flax fibre composites are shown to be in good agreement with the measured stiffnesses of the composites in three testing directions (0°, 45°, and 90°). The use of the actual yarn orientations measured by the FFO method, instead of the nominal yarn orientations of ±45°, is shown to result in improved CLT predictions of stiffness with a mean deviation between predictions and measurements on 0.2 GPa. Altogether, it is demonstrated that stiffness of multiaxial flax fibre composites can be accurately predicted by CLT, without any fitting constants, based on independently determined stiffness parameters of the related uniaxial flax fibre composite, and based on measured yarn orientations in the flax fibre fabric."

Given the rise of hypertension-related diseases in the Dominican Republic, the purpose of our study was to identify hypertension-related health beliefs of Dominicans in order to inform the development of culturally appropriate interventions for hypertension prevention, care, and treatment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 Dominicans, 15 of whom were receiving treatment for hypertension. Operating within the interpretative paradigmatic framework, we conducted thematic analyses of interview data to identify hypertension-related health beliefs and practices. Iterative data analysis revealed the following themes: 1) Negative emotions are a primary cause of hypertension, 2) Medication is the best treatment but adherence is challenging, 3) Systemic barriers impede treatment access, 4) Hypertension negatively impacts mental and physical well-being, and 5) Lifestyle changes, relaxation, and social support help manage hypertension. Data gathered from member checking validated these findings. This study enhances understanding of the beliefs and experiences of Dominicans and emphasize the importance of implementing culturally competent health programming and care."
