https://openalex.org/W2030323546,THE following observations would seem to throw fresh light upon the question of the mode of action of hyaluronidase on connective tissue permeability.
https://openalex.org/W2059800873,"MOST of the methods of detection of sugars depend upon the formation of furfurals by the treatment of the sugar with mineral acid or fairly strong organic acid (for example, trichloracetic acid), and subsequent formation of a coloured compound with an amine or a phenol. The most common faults of the reagents hitherto tried are: (1) a partial destruction of the paper, making it fragile; (2) a dark background colour; (3) poor distinction between the various classes of sugars."

https://openalex.org/W2154696296,"THE mycelia of certain wood-rotting and litter-decomposing Hymenomycetes form enzymes of the laccase type1. I have shown that the mycelium of Marasmius graminum produces a copper-containing phenol oxidase of the same type. This enzyme catalyses the oxidation of polyphenols and aromaticdiamines, the oxidation of p-phenylenediamine being much faster than that of catechol. It is not poisoned by carbon monoxide2. The fruit-bodies of the cultivated mushroom, Psalliota bispora f. albida (= “Ps. campestris”), contain a polyphenol oxidase which oxidizes catechol but not p-phenylenediamine and which is inhibited by carbon monoxide3. Provided that the mycelium of Ps. bispora contains the same carbon monoxide–sensitive oxidase, it should be possible to clarify the problem of whether the phenol oxidases of these fungi act as terminal respiratory enzymes. This might be done by studying the influence of carbon monoxide on the respiration of the mycelia. The respiration of the Psalliota mycelium ought to be sensitive to carbon monoxide whereas that of Marasmius ought to be insensitive. Therefore, the mycelia of both fungi were grown in Barcroft vessels, and the influence of carbon monoxide on the respiration was determined. Respiration was not inhibited in either of the two fungi."
https://openalex.org/W1995736739,"CHYMOTRYPSIN displays both esterase and proteolytic activity, and it has recently been shown1 that this enzyme is inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphonate and that loss of esterase activity is paralleled by loss of proteolytic activity. Diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate (E.600) resembles diisopropyl fluorophosphonate in being a very powerful anticholinesterase. We have found that it will also inhibit chymotrypsin, and have been studying the system chymotrypsin–diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a convenient model for other esterase systems, since the physical data for this enzyme (purity, molecular weight, etc.) are among the more accurately known."

Hitherto there has been no indication of other catechol substances in mammalian heart. However, hydroxytyramine occurs in urine5,6, and has recently been found in sheep suprarenals7."

https://openalex.org/W2015589518,"SEA-URCHINS differ from mammals, in which fertilization is internal and the survival of spermatozoa largely depends on extraneous nutrients provided by accessory secretions, in that fertilization takes place after the eggs and sperm have been shed into sea water, which is a poor source of organic nutrients. Furthermore, unlike mammalian spermatozoa which in most species, including man, obtain their metabolic energy through anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis1, sea-urchin spermatozoa depend on a non-glycolytic and strictly aerobic metabolism; sea-urchin semen is devoid of significant amounts of fructose or other fermentable sugars; and the spermatozoa are incapable of glycolysing sugars added in vitro2."

https://openalex.org/W1979063682,"POSTERIOR pituitary hormone analogues have been known from the neural region of Ascidians for some time1,2, though doubt has been thrown on their reality3. One investigator only seems to have looked for anterior pituitary hormones4; he examined an extract from the neural region (ganglion + neural gland + ciliated pit) of Polycarpa for gonadotrophically active substance. Unfortunately, as he admitted himself, he had not sufficient material for an adequate test, so his results remained inconclusive and have not been generally accepted. In the course of other investigations I have had occasion to repeat this work using two other Ascidians, Ciona intestinalis (L.) and Phallusia mammilata (Cuv.)."

https://openalex.org/W2070372784,"LITTLE information is available on the excretion of methylthiouracil, particularly after its administration in hyperthyroidism. Since the drug is now widely prescribed for the reduction of hyperthyroid and thyrotoxic states, we have been interested in the development of a colour reaction for it capable of adaptation on a quantitative basis. Up to the present, colorimetric methods for the determination of thiouracil and propylthiouracil have been based upon the original procedure of Anderson1, who applied Grote's reagent2 for the determination of thiourea and compounds containing the C=S group to the determination of thiouracil in urine. Methods using Grote's reagent, however, are subject to a number of disadvantages, the chief of which are: (1) instability of the stock reagent; (2) tedious adjustment of the reaction; (3) preparation of standards for each set of determinations. Except for the procedure of Williams et al.3 all workers report an unstable reagent; the method of Williams et al. has the disadvantage of a 12-hr, digestion procedure. Since the colour reaction described in this communication represents a new approach to the subject, previous work will not be discussed further."

https://openalex.org/W2065224706,"PAST work has indicated that fractionation of diphtheria antitoxic horse serum yields fractions of which the dilution ratio, and hence the firmness of combination, may show considerable variations. There was a definite correlation between the in vitro/in vivo ratio and the dilution ratio1. Kekwick and Record2 examined electrophoretically pure gamma- and beta-globulin from hyperimmune horse sera, and found that both fractions had antitoxic activity and that they differed in their L + /Lf ratios and in their speed of flocculation. It was of interest to investigate whether this was a general phenomenon, or one confined to the diphtheria toxin–antitoxin system, by studying the relation between tetanus toxin and horse tetanus antitoxic sera."
https://openalex.org/W2007250354,"AMONG the indolic compounds formed from tryptophane in animal intestine, indole, skatole and indolethylamine are those reported to have the strongest pharmacological action. Their effect on plain or striated muscle has been studied in the past, either in vivo or in the isolated organs, although with no clear and consistent results1–5. More recently, Torda and Wolff6 have examined the effect of indole, skatole, indole-3-acetate and tryptophane on the sensitivity of frog striated muscle to acetylcholine and potassium, finding that only indole increases the response to acetylcholine, while indole, skatole and indoleacetate increase the potassium effect. Since the presence in the bowel of indole and allied compounds seems to be a normal fact7, and that the intestinal membrane can absorb and fix significant amounts of indole8, and presumably other indole compounds as well, it seemed interesting to study their effect on the intestinal smooth muscle, as it might have implications in regard to the alterations of intestine motility."

https://openalex.org/W2049920185,"WHEN an ice-cold benzene solution (12 c.c.) of perbenzoic acid (0.6 gm.) was added (during a period of 5 min.) to a benzene solution (12 c.c.) of diphenylene diazomethane (0.5 gm.) at 45°, a vigorous evolution of gas was observed. The temperature was kept at 45° for a further 10 min. and benzoic acid removed by extraction with sodium carbonate. The product was dried in vacuo and the residue recrystallized from dilute methyl alcohol yielding fluorenone (0.15 gm.)."

https://openalex.org/W1998601212,"WE have investigated the unsaponifiable fraction of cod-liver oil and found that it has a strong bacteriostatic effect; especially interesting is the fact that in vitro it suppresses growth of M. tuberculosis. The non-saponifiable matter was chromatographed over alumina, the fraction most firmly held having the strongest activity. This fraction was a viscous oil and did not contain sterols, vitamin A or vitamin D. Only hydroxylic compounds (probably chiefly unsaturated) were present, and among these α-glyceryl ethers were found. After hydrogenation the bacteriostatic effect decreased considerably. The fraction inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis in concentrations of 1–3 µgm. per ml. Sauton medium."
