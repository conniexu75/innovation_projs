https://openalex.org/W2068391832,"Normal ovulatory menstrual cycles were initiated in prepubertal female rhesus monkeys by the infusion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone for 6 minutes once every hour. When this regimen was discontinued, the animals promptly reverted to an immature state. These findings permit the conclusion that neither adenohypophysial nor ovarian competence is limiting in the initiation of puberty and suggest that this process depends on the maturation of the neuroendocrine control system that directs the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus."
https://openalex.org/W1992332411,"We have examined nuclear transport in Aspergillus nidulans to determine whether microtubles function in the movement of this organelle. Nuclear movement was found to be inhibited in germinating conidia (uninucleate asexual spores) by the microtubule inhibitor benomyl. To show that the benomyl inhibition was due to its effect on microtubules, the test was repeated with mutants which have genetic lesions in β-tubulin which produce resistance to benomyl in one case (benA15) and super-sensitivity in another (benA16). Nuclear movement was resistant to benomyl in the strain carrying benA15 and super-sensitive in the strain carrying benAl6. Since altered sensitivity to benomyl in these strains is specifically due to alterations in β-tubulin, these results show that β-tubulin is involved in nuclear movement. To eliminate the possibility that nuclear movement blockage was a secondary consequence of nuclear division blockage, this experiment was repeated with temperature-sensitive nuclear division mutants. At restrictive temperature, nuclear division was blocked in these mutants but nuclear movement was not. In the presence of benomyl, nuclear division and migration were blocked at permissive and restrictive temperatures. Thus nuclear division blockage alone is not sufficient to block nuclear movement. These experiments were corroborated by similar experiments on a temperature-sensitive nuclear movement mutant. Five previously isolated nonallelic temperature-sensitive nuclear movement mutants, nudA-E, were analyzed genetically and found not to be allelic to the benA (β-tubulin) tubA α-tubulin genes."

The incorporation of 3H-labeled leucine by human placental tissue in vitro into pLRF was determined by purification on carboxymethyl-cellulose and specific immunoprecipitation of the 3H-labeled pLRF. The specific activity of the pLRF released into the medium increased 100-fold from day 1 to day 2 of culture and attained a concentration of 2.84 microcuries per microgram. These data indicate that the pLRF that was released initially was endogenous, whereas that released subsequently reflected synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2058755065,Specific binding sites for blood-borne insulin were determined to be selectively localized on axons and axon terminals in the external median eminence and the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus by means of quantitative fine structural radioautography. This localization suggests that discrete populations of hypothalamic nerve terminals are potential targets for the direct effects of insulin and that insulin may act through synaptic mechanisms to influence hypothalamic circuits regulating energy balance and hypophyseal function.

https://openalex.org/W1600876296,"A procedure has been developed for the rapid purification of the enzyme T4 DNA ligase. The procedure involves the induction at 42 degrees C of a lambda lysogen containing the gene for T4 DNA ligase (Murray, N.E., Bruce, S.A., and Murray, K. (1979) J. Mol. Biol. 132, 493-504), followed by purification of the ligase activity by phosphocellulose and hydroxylapatite chromatography. This results in the purification of large amounts of ligase with very high specific activity. The enzyme is free of contaminating exo- and endonuclease activities and active in the ligation of DNA fragments possessing cohesive or blunt-end termini."
https://openalex.org/W1502184199,"Abstract Rapid RNA sequencing technology was used to determine if the base specificities of an RNase recently purified from chicken liver would prove useful for RNA sequence analysis. Escherichia coli 5 S [5'-32P]rRNA or yeast 5.8 S [5'-32P]rRNA was digested with the enzyme and this digest, along with digests derived from RNases of known specificity (U2, T1, T2) were subjected to electrophoresis through denaturing polyacrylamide slab gels. Following autoradiography, the banding patterns arising from the activity of each enzyme were compared, and the base specificity of the unknown RNase was established. The chicken liver RNase was found to have a marked preference for phosphodiester bonds containing cytidylic acid residues, a property which should make the enzyme useful for distinguishing between pyrimidines in RNA sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W1570077039,"The binding of heavy meromyosin (HMM), a soluble two-headed fragment of myosin, to F-actin was examined at mu = 0.22 M, 22 degrees C. The actin-HMM association constant was determined by having HMM and subfragment 1 (S-1) compete for sites on F-actin. In these experiments, varying concentrations of S-1 were added to a fixed concentration of HMM and F-actin. F-actin and bound fragments (HMM and S-1) then were sedimented and the concentration of unbound fragments was determined. The data were analyzed using a set of theoretical equations proposed by Hill ((1978) Nature 274, 825-826) that provide a simple way of analyzing the relative binding of one- and two-headed ligands. Using these equations, the actin-HMM association constant was determined to be 3 x 10(9) M-1, while under the same conditions the actin-S-1 association constant is 5 x 10(6) M-1 (determined in preceding paper (Greene, L. E., and Eisenberg, E. (1980) J. Biol, Chem. 255, 543-548)). Therefore, under these conditions, HMM binds 600-fold stronger to actin than does S-1, indicating that both of the HMM heads can bind strongly to actin."

The antiserum did not affect blood pressure in sodium-replete dogs but decreased plasma renin activity and blood pressure in sodium-depleted animals. The antiserum also reduced blood pressure to control levels concomitant with suppression of plasma renin activity in uninephrectomized dogs with acute renovascular hypertension. These observations establish the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure in the sodium-depleted state as well as in the initiation of renovascular hypertension."

https://openalex.org/W1505973422,"The mechanism of streptolydigin inhibition of RNA synthesis has been investigated with a combination of steady state kinetics and product analysis by employing the abortive initiation reaction of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. The pattern of inhibition by streptolydigin on the poly[d(A-T)] . poly[d(A-T)]template (non-competitive versus AMP; competitive versus UTP) was consistent with one inhibitor binding site and with an ordered addition of AMP followed by UTP. The more complicated patterns observed on the poly[d(I-C)] . poly[d(I-C)] template and the bacteriophage T7 A2 promotor (noncompetitive versus CTP) were explained by assuming that streptolydigin could stabilize the translocated ternary complex containing the product dinucleotide. Product analysis of two other abortive initiation reactions showed that the product did not dissociate from the inhibitor-bound translocated ternary complex. Finally, rifampicin and streptolydigin were shown to be functionally independent during initiation on several templates."
https://openalex.org/W1991279507,"The interplay of insulin, cortisol, and prolactin induces synthesis of casein and alpha-lactalbumin in cultured mammary explants from mature virgin mice. A striking difference has been found between the optimal concentrations of cortisol required for maximal induction of the two milk proteins in vitro: 3 x 10(-8) molar for alpha-lactalbumin and 3 x 10(-6) molar for casein. Moreover, 10(-7) to 10(-5) molar cortisol caused progressive inhibition of alpha-lactalbumin accumulation. Such differential actions of cortisol may partly account for the asynchronous synthesis of the two proteins during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W1599344936,"To elucidate the role of zinc-bound water in liver alcohol dehydrogenase catalysis, chelation by 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2-bipyridine was studied. The rate constants for association of both chelating agents to the active center zinc were pH-dependent with a pKa of 9.2 and preferential binding to a protonated form. The binary complex dissociation rate constants were pH-independent for both chelating agents. In the presence of saturating NAD+, the pKa for the equilibrium binding of 2,2-bipyridine was perturbed to 7.6, similar to the functional group previously shown to be involved in NAD+ binding. The presence of saturating imidazole resulted in pH-independent 2,2-bipyridine binding. These studies provide compelling evidence that the ionizing enzyme functional group involved in coenzyme binding, proton liberation, and conformational states is zinc-bound water. The limiting rate of chelation by 2,2-bipyridine was pH-independent, and no limiting rate was observed in the presence of saturating imidazole. These results indicate that the limiting rate of chelation is due to the rate of dissociation of zinc-bound water. The implications of this regarding the role of zinc in catalytic turnover of liver alcohol dehydrogenase are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1500614664,"Highly purified preparations of dnaG protein from Escherichia coli prime minus strand synthesis of phage alpha 3 DNA in vitro. This protein synthesizes primer oligonucleotides which may be composed of ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide moieties or both. The presence of deoxyribonucleotide moieties in the chain limits primer chain length; this effect occurs even when ribonucleoside triphosphates are included in the priming reaction. The dnaG protein can use ADP in place of ATP. Primer formation by dnaG protein is strictly stoiochiometric in vitro; one molecule of dnaG protein is required to prime one molecule of alpha 3 DNA. All of these primers are equally efficient in the subsequent elongation reaction with DNA elongation factors I and III, dnaZ gene product, and DNA polymerase III to form RFII. The site recognized by dnaG protein on alpha 3 DNA in vitro is within the same region of the alpha 3 chromosome as the origin of replication in vivo. Structural properties of this site are crucial to dnaG action in vitro. No other enzymatic activity for dnaG protein has been detected."
https://openalex.org/W1542237986,"In the interaction between Escherichia coli virus T1 and its host cell, which leads to reorientation of macromolecule synthesis, the alteration of the host cell membrane is an important step: The proton-motive force is rapidly reduced. This became apparent from selective changes in energy-coupled transports: proton-motive force- and ATP-dependent transports are inhibited in wild type cells. However, in ATPase-deficient (unc-) cells the ATP-driven transports are not affected by T1. The membrane potential is reduced by T1 as was measured by triphenylmethylphosphonium ion distribution. The potassium gradient is dissipated and calcium ions are accumulated by the cells. However, the residual (but reduced) membrane energy is essential for T1 development since the addition of uncouplers prevents any viral production. Consistently, the cell membrane remains intact after T1 infection: proteins, like beta-galactoside, amino acids, and alpha-methylglucoside cannot passively penetrate the membrane of T1-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1659136561,"The fidelity of protein biosynthesis in vitro was studied quantitatively in a well defined system that employed poly(A) as a message for the elaboration of phenylalanine-containing polypeptides from Escherichia coli phenylalanyl-tRNALys. Admixture of phenylalanyl-tRNALys and lysyl-tRNALys in three different ratios resulted in the efficient formation of peptides that contained the amino acids in the same ratios in which they had been utilized in the individual incubation mixtures. The incorporation was also shown to be codon-specific in a quantitative sense; the poly(A)-directed incorporation of [14C]phenylalanine from phenylalanyl-tRNALys was unaffected by [3H]phenylalanyl tRNAPhe, by arginyl-tRNA (one species of which responds to the codon triplet AGA) or by unfractionated E. coli tRNA. These findings suggest that the transfer of amino acids from (misacylated) tRNAs into polypeptides in vitro is as predicted by the adapter hypothesis and that such systems can operate with sufficient fidelity to permit the preparation of proteins having defined amino acid substitutions."
https://openalex.org/W1590747881,"Phenylglyoxal, an arginine-specific reagent, strongly inhibits DNA polymerases isolated from eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and RNA tumor viral sources as well as Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. The inhibitory action of phenylglyoxal appears to be due to interference with the template binding function of these enzymes and implies the presence of an arginine residue at the template binding site of these enzymes from diverse sources and suggests that template dependent DNA, and perhaps RNA polymerases, may be mechanistically similar with respect to their template binding function. In contrast, the activity of terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase, a template-independent DNA polymerase isolated from calf thymus, is not inhibited by phenylglyoxal. A detailed analysis of the inhibitory process carried out using avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) DNA polymerase as a test enzyme revealed that inclusion of template-primer during the preincubation with phenylglyoxal, but not substrate triphosphates or primer alone, protects the enzyme against phenylglyoxal inactivation. Furthermore, phenylglyoxal does not appear to inhibit the elongation of initiated DNA strands, but blocks the reinitiation of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1625888066,"Abstract A deoxyadenosylcobalamin-dependent ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase has been purified to homogeneity from cell free extracts of Corynebacterium nephridii. Ion exchange chromatography of th extract on DEAE-Sephadex and DEAE-Bio-Gel A, followed by affinity chromatography on dGTP-Sepharose, yielded two forms of the reductase. The first reductase, which was weakly bound to the affinity column, was eluted with 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 6.5, while the second, more tightly bound form required 2 M urea for its elution. The weakly bound form is homogeneous as judged by gel filtration, equilibrium sedimentation, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This enzyme is a dimeric protein with a molecular weight of 196,000, composed of two identical or very similar subunits with molecular weights of 100,000. The second protein appears to be a polymeric form of the reductase. Both forms of the enzyme catalyze the reduction of the four common ribonucleoside diphosphates as well as the hydrogen exchange between adenosylcobalamin and the solvent. The ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase system of C. nephridii appears to be intermediate between the more primitive adenosylcobalamin-dependent reductase system of Lactobacillus leichmannii and the more advanced nonheme iron system of Escherichia coli."

https://openalex.org/W1558046729,"The three known active site residues of the tryptophan synthase beta 2 subunit from Escherichia coli are shown to fall within 25 residues of each other in the primary sequence of the NH2-terminal region of the beta 2 subunit. These residues are: lysine-86, which forms a Schiff's base with pyridoxal phosphate; histidine-81 or histidine-85, which removes the alpha proton of L-serine; and cysteine-61, which reacts with bromoacetylpyridoxamine phosphate, an affinity label for the beta 2 subunit. The sequence of the first 78 residues of a single cyanogen bromide fragment containing these active site residues has been determined by automatic Edman degradation and by sequence analysis of daughter peptides. This 79-residue cyanogen bromide fragment, which contains the 22-residue pyridoxyl peptide sequenced earlier by Fluri et al. (Fluri, R., Jackson, L. E., Lee, W. E., and Crawford, I. P. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6620-6624), was placed at the NH2-terminal end of the beta chain beginning at residue 22. Thus, the primary sequence of residues 1 to 99 of the beta 2 subunit is reported."
https://openalex.org/W1498762331,"Abstract The primary structure of Escherichia coli tRNA UUR Le which recognizes the UU series of codons has been determined.

The chain length of tRNA UUR Leu is 87 residues, the same as other E. coli tRNA Leu s and T4 phage-coded tRNA Leus. Its sequence is especially similar to that of E. coli tRNA2 Leu in the Darm and T psi C arm regions. E. coli tRNA UUR Leu contains an unknown modified nucleoside in the first position of the anticodon and was shown by mass spectrometry and chemical degradation to be an adenosine derivativee. Addition of tRNA UUR Leu to a cell-free protein-synthesizing system with high Mg2+ concentration resulted in the formation of polyleucine miscoded by poly(U), indicating that the unknown modified nucleoside exhibits a tendency to recognize U under certain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1500732526,"Detailed kinetic analysis was performed on asparaginase II, a cell wall glycoprotein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme was highly active in the hydrolysis and hydroxylaminolysis reactions with D- and L-asparagine and with a variety of N-substituted analogues. The data from studies involving pH dependencey, substrate saturation, and product inhibition support the hypotheses that (a) the yeast asparaginase mechanism proceeds via an acyl enzyme intermediate; (b) an ionizable group on the enzyme, pK approximately 6.0, is involved in the acylation and deacylation reactions; and (c) yeast asparaginase II is a peptidoasparaginase."
https://openalex.org/W1577944578,"Saccharopine dehydrogenase (epsilon-N-(L-glutaryl-2)-L-lysine: NAD oxidoreductase (L-lysine-forming) EC 1.5.1.7) from baker's yeast is inactivated by diethyl pyrocarbonate. Spectrophotometric studies show that the inactivation results from the modification of 3 histidyl residues/molecule of enzyme. The sulfhydryl content of the enzyme is unchanged by modification. The reversibility of inactivation by hydroxylamine and the pH dependence of inactivation are also consistent with the inactivation being due to modification of the histidyl residue. Although the coenzyme and substrates are without effect when added singly, the inactivation is completely protected by alpha-ketoglutarate in the presence of a saturating concentration of NADH. Since alpha-ketoglutarate binds only to the enzyme . NADH complex, the results suggest that the inactivation is due to modification of the residue at or near the substrate-binding site. Under the conditions where the inactivation is largely protected by NADH plus alpha-ketoglutarate, 2 histidyl residues appear to be modified suggesting that only 1 residue involved in the catalytic activity. The modification appears to prevent the binding of alpha-ketoglutarate, but not of the coenzyme, to the enzyme. The protein fluorescence of the native and modified enzymes is quenched by NAD+ and NADH. However, the NADH titration curve of the modified enzyme is not affected by alpha-ketoglutarate, in contrast to the native enzyme which shows an increase in the apparent affinity for the coenzyme in the presence of alpha-ketoglutarate."

https://openalex.org/W1563688046,"The influence of serum on the synthesis of the nervous system specific S-100 protein has been investigated in the rat glial cell clone C61a. In sparse cells, where S-100 synthesis is low, removal of serum leads to a 2- to 3-fold increase of the rate of S-100 synthesis relative to total soluble cell protein. Measurements of S-100 content by radioimmunoassay showed that sparse cells are accumulating S-100 much more rapidly in the absence of serum. Our findings suggest that serum components inhibit the expression of S-100 synthesis in sparse cells by a concentration-dependent mechanism. This effect does not correlate directly with the reduced cellular growth rate in low serum or serum-free medium. Lipid-free medium, which has little growth-promoting activity, maintains the capacity to lower the rate of S-100 synthesis. A partially purified extract of platelets can substitute for serum in repressing the synthesis of the S-100 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1523571245,"Permeabilized cells of Escherichia coli were used to examine the effect on RNA synthesis of guanosine 5‘-diphosphate-3‘-monophosphate (ppGp). Electrophoretic and hybridization analysis of bulk RNA demonstrated that ppGp selectively reduced the accumulation of both ribosomal and transfer RNAs. The experiments further suggested that the observed reduction in stable RNA accumulation resulted from a reduction in stable RNA chain initiation rather than an effect on elongation, processing, or maturation of stable RNA transcripts. In contrast, the expression of the lac Z gene was not affected by ppGp. These results suggest that ppG, a nucleotide produced in E. coli during the stringent response, could play a direct role in the stringent regulation of stable RNA synthesis."

The apoprotein of cytochrome b present in the mutant was identical with cytochrome b of control cells (mutant cells grown in the presence of delta-aminolevulinic acid) by the following criteria: similar apparent molecular weights in dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; anomalous migration behavior during electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels of different porosities; identical gel pattern obtained after immunoprecipitation with specific antiserum against cytochrome b; and identical fingerprints obtained after limited proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The kinetics of incorporation in vivo of [35S]methionine into apoprotein of cytochrome b in the mutant suggested that heme deficiency may affect assembly into the membrane of subunits of the cytochrome b.c1 complex rather than synthesis of cytochrome b."
https://openalex.org/W1539634678,"Up to now it was not possible to isolate an enzyme . adenylate complex after mixing the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli with ATP, MgCl2, and glutamate. This enzyme catalyzes an AMP-dependent and PPi-independent deacylation of Glu-tRNAGlu. The labeled glutamate which disappears from Glu-tRNAGlu in the presence of AMP remains linked to the enzyme in a complex isolated by filtration on nitrocellulose discs. The addition of tRNAGlu to this reaction mixture at the deacylation plateau gives rise to a synthesis of Glu-tRNAGlu, via an ATP-independent reaction. These results indicate the existence of the following equilibrated reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase E + Glu-tRNAGlu + AMP in equilibrium E . AMP approximately Glu + tRNAGlu. This transfer of glutamate from an activated complex to tRNAGlu indicates that the formation of glutamyl-tRNA is catalyzed via a two-step reaction mechanism. The AMP-dependent and PPi-independent deacylation of Glu-tRNAGlu is the rate-limiting step of the reverse of the AMP- and PPi-dependent deacylation."
https://openalex.org/W1542844327,"We present here a detailed analysis of the effect of amino acid starvation and the addition of cycloheximide on RNA metabolism of yeast cells and spheroplasts. These effects have been studied at the level of uridine phosphorylation, methylation of rRNA, and biosynthesis of 35 S, 4 S, and 5 S RNA species. Amino acid starvation inhibits the phosphorylation of uridine assigned for RNA synthesis more than that for other metabolic processes. This implies that a salvage pathway for the synthesis of UMP and CMP is regulated by the rate of transcription and perhaps is localized in the nucleus. The rate of rRNA methylation is not coupled with the rate of transcription; therefore, quantitation of 35 S RNA synthesis (yeast rRNA primary transcript by [methyl-3H]methionine labeling is unreliable. Biosynthesis of 35 S RNA ceases immediately after the cells are transferred to an amino-acid-deficient medium; at a later time 4 S and 5 S RNAs are also inhibited. Therefore, coordination and noncoordination in the stringent response of these RNA species depend upon the time of starvation. Although addition of a small dose (less than 1.0 microgram/ml) of cycloheximide to starved yeast spheroplasts does not alter the rate of uridine phosphorylation, it increases the rate of entrance of uridine into total RNA. This effect is of greater magnitude in 4 S and 5 S than in 35 S RNA. Since the drug does not alter the rate of decay of 35 S RNA that takes place in starvation, it has a selective effect on transcription. A similar small dose, however, produces inhibition of transcription of all these RNA species in nonstarved conditions. This opposite effect of the drug appears to be a characteristic feature of RNA metabolism in eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W1483122851,"Kinetic studies were done to obtain a quantitative estimation of the synergistic interactions that occur between phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (orthophosphate:oxaloacetate carboxylase (phosphorylating) E.C. 4.1.1.31) from Escherichia coli K12 and various combinations of its primary substrate, P-enolpyruvate, and the activators acetylcoenzyme A, CDP, GTP, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The analysis involves the evaluation of apparent K values, KS for P-enolpyru;ate and KA for activators, as a function of the concentration of P-enolpyruvate or another activator in the case of KA determinations. Methods are presented which allow the determination of dissociation constants for P-enolpyruvate and activators from binary, ternary, and quaternary complexes of enzyme with substrates or activators, or both. It was observed that synergistic activation occurs with acetyl coenzyme A and all of the coactivators but not with fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and the other co-activators. The enhancement of binding from the binary enzyme substrate (or activator) complex to the ternary or quaternary complexes is in the range of 100-fold. The dissociation constants for P-enolpyruvate, acetyl coenzyme A, CDP, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate are the same from any active enzyme species. Synergistic activation by multiple activators reflects the ability of co-activators to shift the equilibrium concentrations of active enzyme species away from the inactive forms via a modified cascade scheme, thus decreasing the probability that dissociation of any one activator will yield an inactive enzyme species."
https://openalex.org/W1559329092,"Pyruvate oxidase is a peripheral membrane enzyme isolated from Escherichia coli. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to yield acetate plus CO2. The specific activity of the purified oxidase is stimulated 25-fold by lipids, and this lipid requirement has been the subject of previous studies. Since the enzyme is a tetramer at high protein concentrations (1 mg/ml) and is known to self-aggregate under certain conditions, the question arose as to whether the lipid stimulation observed in the steady state assay might be due to a change in the quaternary structure of the protein, either a dissociation or further association. This report is directed at determining the state of association of pyruvate oxidase under assay conditions by using fluorescence polarization. A photoreactive, nonspecific probe, 1-azidonaphthalene 5-sulfonate, was used to label the protein surface with an extrinsic fluorophore. It is concluded that under steady state assay conditions the oxidase remains tetrameric."

Formation of PlaTrp represents a typical peptic amino transfer reaction. In this instance PlaTrp undoubtedly derives from a reaction between the acceptor, Pla, and the carboxylate anion, CF3CO-TrpCOOO- (or a species obtained from it). This observation suggests that in general the anionic form of a substrate, such as AcPheTrpCOOO- in the case of AcPheTrp, may be the primary source of the amino acid residue transferred in amino transpeptidations. Other evidence supports the validity of the proposal. Furthermore it has the virtue of rationally explaining why AcPheTrpNH2-like substrates fail to participate in amino transpeptidations and why these reactions tend to increase in importance at high pH."
