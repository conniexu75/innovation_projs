https://openalex.org/W2036639816,"The transcriptional corepressors SMRT and N-CoR function as silencing mediators for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors. Here we show that SMRT and N-CoR directly interact with mSin3A, a corepressor for the Mad–Max heterodimer and a homolog of the yeast global–transcriptional repressor Sin3p. In addition, we demonstrate that the recently characterized histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) interacts with Sin3A and SMRT to form a multisubunit repressor complex. Consistent with this model, we find that HDAC inhibitors synergize with retinoic acid to stimulate hormone-responsive genes and differentiation of myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells. This work establishes a convergence of repression pathways for bHLH-Zip proteins and nuclear receptors and suggests this type of regulation may be more widely conserved than previously suspected."
https://openalex.org/W1980952363,"The pathways by which mammalian Ras proteins induce cortical actin rearrangement and cause cellular transformation are investigated using partial loss of function mutants of Ras and activated and inhibitory forms of various postulated target enzymes for Ras. Efficient transformation by Ras requires activation of other direct effectors in addition to the MAP kinase kinase kinase Raf and is inhibited by inactivation of the PI 3-kinase pathway. Actin rearrangement correlates with the ability of Ras mutants to activate PI 3-kinase. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity blocks Ras induction of membrane ruffling, while activated PI 3-kinase is sufficient to induce membrane ruffling, acting through Rac. The ability of activated Ras to stimulate PI 3-kinase in addition to Raf is therefore important in Ras transformation of mammalian cells and essential in Ras-induced cytoskeletal reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W2104788426,"Transcriptional repression by Mad–Max heterodimers requires interaction of Mad with the corepressors mSin3A/B. Sin3p, the S. cerevisiae homolog of mSin3, functions in the same pathway as Rpd3p, a protein related to two recently identified mammalian histone deacetylases, HDAC1 and HDAC2. Here, we demonstrate that mSin3A and HDAC1/2 are associated in vivo. HDAC2 binding requires a conserved region of mSin3A capable of mediating transcriptional repression. In addition, Mad1 forms a complex with mSin3 and HDAC2 that contains histone deacetylase activity. Trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, abolishes Mad repression. We propose that Mad–Max functions by recruiting the mSin3–HDAC corepressor complex that deacetylates nucleosomal histones, producing alterations in chromatin structure that block transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2006470470,"Stimulation of cells with inducers of NF-kappaB such as LPS and IL-1 leads to the degradation of IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-beta proteins and translocation of NF-kappaB to the nucleus. We now demonstrate that, besides the physical partitioning of inactive NF-kappaB to the cytosol, the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB is regulated through phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 by protein kinase A (PKA). The catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) is maintained in an inactive state through association with IkappaB-alpha or IkappaB-beta in an NF-kappaB-IkappaB-PKAc complex. Signals that cause the degradation of IkappaB result in activation of PKAc in a cAMP-independent manner and the subsequent phosphorylation of p65. Therefore, this pathway represents a novel mechanism for the cAMP-independent activation of PKA and the regulation of NF-kappaB activity."
https://openalex.org/W2016567695,"Members of the Mad family of bHLH-Zip proteins heterodimerize with Max to repress transcription in a sequence-specific manner. Transcriptional repression by Mad:Max heterodimers is mediated by ternary complex formation with either of the corepressors mSin3A or mSin3B. We report here that mSin3A is an in vivo component of large, heterogeneous multiprotein complexes and is tightly and specifically associated with at least seven polypeptides. Two of the mSin3A-associated proteins, p50 and p55, are highly related to the histone deacetylase HDAC1. The mSin3A immunocomplexes possess histone deacetylase activity that is sensitive to the specific deacetylase inhibitor trapoxin. mSin3A-targeted repression of a reporter gene is reduced by trapoxin treatment, suggesting that histone deacetylation mediates transcriptional repression through Mad-Max-mSin3A multimeric complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2074096799,"An important event in gene expression is the covalent modification of histone proteins. We have found that the mammalian transcriptional repressor Sin3 (mSin3) exists in a complex with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. Consistent with the observation that mSin3-mediated repression of transcription involves the modification of histone polypeptides, we found that the mSin3-containing complex includes polypeptides that tether the mSin3 complex to core histone proteins. In addition, two novel mSin3-associated polypeptides, SAP18 and SAP30, were identified. We isolated a cDNA encoding human SAP18 and found that SAP18 is a component of an mSin3-containing complex in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate a direct interaction between SAP18 and mSin3. SAP18 represses transcription in vivo when tethered to the promoter, consistent with the ability of SAP18 to interact with mSin3."
https://openalex.org/W2033749460,"Sin3 and Rpd3 negatively regulate a diverse set of yeast genes. A mouse Sin3-related protein is a transcriptional corepressor, and a human Rpd3 homolog is a histone deacetylase. Here, we show that Sin3 and Rpd3 are specifically required for transcriptional repression by Ume6, a DNA-binding protein that regulates genes involved in meiosis. A short region of Ume6 is sufficient to repress transcription, and this repression domain mediates a two-hybrid and physical interaction with Sin3. Coimmunoprecipitation and two-hybrid experiments indicate that Sin3 and Rpd3 are associated in a complex distinct from TFIID and Pol II holoenzyme. Rpd3 is specifically required for repression by Sin3, and artificial recruitment of Rpd3 results in repression. These results suggest that repression by Ume6 involves recruitment of a Sin3-Rpd3 complex and targeted histone deacetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2085490483,"The docking of transport vesicles with their target membrane is thought to be mediated by p115. We show here that GM130, a cis-Golgi matrix protein, interacts specifically with p115 and so could provide a membrane docking site. Deletion analysis showed that the N-terminus binds to p115, whereas the C-terminus binds to Golgi membranes. Mitotic phosphorylation of GM130 or a peptide derived from the N-terminus prevented binding to p115. The peptide also inhibited the NSF- but not the p97-dependent reassembly of Golgi cisternae from mitotic fragments, unless it was mitotically phosphorylated. Together, these data provide a molecular explanation for the COPI-mediated fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus at the onset of mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2044005280,"The antibiotic lactacystin was reported to covalently modify β-subunit X of the mammalian 20 S proteasome and inhibit several of its peptidase activities. However, we demonstrate that [3H]lactacystin treatment modifies all the proteasome's catalytic β-subunits. Lactacystin and its more potent derivative β-lactone irreversibly inhibit protein breakdown and the chymotryptic, tryptic, and peptidylglutamyl activities of purified 20 S and 26 S particles, although at different rates. Exposure to these agents for 1 to 2 h reduced the degradation of short- and long-lived proteins in four different mammalian cell lines. Unlike peptide aldehyde inhibitors, lactacystin and the β-lactone do not inhibit lysosomal degradation of an endocytosed protein. These agents block class I antigen presentation of a model protein, ovalbumin (synthesized endogenously or loaded exogenously), but do not affect presentation of the peptide epitope SIINFEKL, which does not require proteolysis for presentation. Generation of most peptides required for formation of stable class I heterodimers is also inhibited. Because these agents inhibited protein breakdown and antigen presentation similarly in interferon-γ-treated cells (where proteasomes contain LMP2 and LMP7 subunits in place of X and Y), all β-subunits must be affected similarly. These findings confirm our prior conclusions that proteasomes catalyze the bulk of protein breakdown in mammalian cells and generate the majority of class I-bound epitopes for immune recognition.

Most of these peptides are generated by protein breakdown in the cytosol and are transported by the transporter associated with antigen presentation transporter into the endoplasmic reticulum (1York I.A.

The mechanisms responsible for the generation of the class I-presented peptides had been unclear until recently. However, a variety of recent evidence has suggested that the proteasome plays a primary role in this process and that during the turnover of cytosolic and nuclear proteins a fraction of the peptides generated by the proteasome are utilized for MHC class I presentation (1York I.A.

The 20 S proteasome is a 700-kDa particle with multiple peptidase activities, including a chymotryptic-, tryptic-, and peptidylglutamyl-like activity (4Orlowski M.

It is a cylindrical-shaped structure composed of four rings, the outer two each contain seven α-subunits and the inner two each contain seven β-subunits (7Grziwa A. Baumeister W. Dahlmann B. Kopp F.

Although the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is clearly essential for the rapid degradation of short-lived or highly abnormal proteins and polypeptides in yeast (15Seufert W. Jentsch S.

Two of the proteasome's catalytic β-subunits, LMP7 and LMP2, are encoded in the MHC region (21Monaco J.J. McDevitt H.O. Hum.

Furthermore, inhibiting ubiquitin conjugation in a TS mutant decreased antigen presentation of a model protein (27Michalek M.T. Grant E.P. Gramm C. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1993; 363: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). On the other hand, modifications of a protein that stimulate its ubiquitinylation and degradation by 26 S proteasomes enhance its rate of MHC class I presentation (28Grant E.P. Michalek M.T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3750-3758PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, when 20 S proteasomes are incubated with a protein for extended periods, they can generate some class I-binding peptides, although such experiments involve highly nonphysiological conditions (29Boes B. Hengel H. Ruppert T. Multhaup G. Koszinowski U.H. Kloetzel P.-M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 30Dick L.R. Aldrich C. Jameson S.C. Moomaw C.R.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 289-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).More definitive evidence for the proteasome's general importance in antigen presentation in vivo requires methods to specifically inhibit proteasome function in intact cells. Recently, certain peptide aldehydes (such asN-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal, LLnL, andN-carbobenzoxyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norvalinal, MG115) have been shown to strongly inhibit multiple peptidase activities of proteasomes and to reduce protein hydrolysis (3Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). Moreover, these agents can enter cells and block the degradation of most cellular proteins and the generation of the majority of class I-presented peptides (3Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). Although these peptide aldehydes can also inhibit the cysteine proteases found in lysosomes and calpains (3Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar), several findings argued that the inhibition of protein degradation and antigen presentation was due to effects on the proteasome. For example, the rank order of potencies of different peptide aldehydes in inhibiting the proteasome was the same as for blocking protein degradation and antigen presentation and did not correlate with efficacy against cysteine proteases (3Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). Also, inhibition of these cysteine proteases did not affect protein breakdown or antigen presentation. Nevertheless, more selective proteasome inhibitors are needed to establish definitively a major role for the proteasome in these processes.A chemically distinct type of proteasome inhibitor is the antibiotic lactacystin which was isolated from Streptomyces by Omura and colleagues (32Omura S. Matsuzaki K. Fujimoto T. Kosuge K. Fuzuya T. Fujita S. Nakagawa A. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 44: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and synthesized by Corey and colleagues (33Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Reichard G.A. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3358-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Fenteany et al. (11Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) have shown that [3H]lactacystin bound covalently to a polypeptide identified as proteasome β-subunit X in bovine brain cells and that lactacystin could irreversibly inhibit the chymotryptic- and tryptic-like peptidase activity and reversibly inhibit the post-acidic activity of purified proteasomes. Lactacystin spontaneously hydrolyzes into clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, which appears to be the active inhibitor that reacts with the N-terminal threonine of subunit X (34Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Grenier L. Melandri F.D. Nunes S.L. Stein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7273-7276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Because lactacystin and the β-lactone appeared to be highly specific inhibitors that do not affect cysteine or serine proteases, they are potentially very useful research tools. We therefore examined whether they inhibit proteasomes that contain β-type subunits not expressed in neurons (e.g. LMP7, LMP2, and MECL-1), whether they reduce protein hydrolysis in vitro and in cells, and whether they can block MHC class I antigen presentation.

Several lines of evidence had suggested that the proteasome was also responsible for the generation of some class I-presented peptides. Two of the proteasome's catalytic β-subunits, LMP7 and LMP2, are encoded in the MHC region (21Monaco J.J. McDevitt H.O. Hum. Immunol. 1986; 15: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Monaco J.J. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 173-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and the absence of these subunits in mutant cells or mice decreases the efficiency of presentation of certain antigens (23Fehling H.J.

Furthermore, inhibiting ubiquitin conjugation in a TS mutant decreased antigen presentation of a model protein (27Michalek M.T. Grant E.P. Gramm C. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1993; 363: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). On the other hand, modifications of a protein that stimulate its ubiquitinylation and degradation by 26 S proteasomes enhance its rate of MHC class I presentation (28Grant E.P. Michalek M.T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3750-3758PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, when 20 S proteasomes are incubated with a protein for extended periods, they can generate some class I-binding peptides, although such experiments involve highly nonphysiological conditions (29Boes B.

More definitive evidence for the proteasome's general importance in antigen presentation in vivo requires methods to specifically inhibit proteasome function in intact cells. Recently, certain peptide aldehydes (such asN-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal, LLnL, andN-carbobenzoxyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norvalinal, MG115) have been shown to strongly inhibit multiple peptidase activities of proteasomes and to reduce protein hydrolysis (3Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). Moreover, these agents can enter cells and block the degradation of most cellular proteins and the generation of the majority of class I-presented peptides (3Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). Although these peptide aldehydes can also inhibit the cysteine proteases found in lysosomes and calpains (3Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar), several findings argued that the inhibition of protein degradation and antigen presentation was due to effects on the proteasome. For example, the rank order of potencies of different peptide aldehydes in inhibiting the proteasome was the same as for blocking protein degradation and antigen presentation and did not correlate with efficacy against cysteine proteases (3Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). Also, inhibition of these cysteine proteases did not affect protein breakdown or antigen presentation. Nevertheless, more selective proteasome inhibitors are needed to establish definitively a major role for the proteasome in these processes. A chemically distinct type of proteasome inhibitor is the antibiotic lactacystin which was isolated from Streptomyces by Omura and colleagues (32Omura S. Matsuzaki K. Fujimoto T. Kosuge K. Fuzuya T. Fujita S. Nakagawa A. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 44: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and synthesized by Corey and colleagues (33Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Reichard G.A. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3358-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Fenteany et al. (11Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) have shown that [3H]lactacystin bound covalently to a polypeptide identified as proteasome β-subunit X in bovine brain cells and that lactacystin could irreversibly inhibit the chymotryptic- and tryptic-like peptidase activity and reversibly inhibit the post-acidic activity of purified proteasomes. Lactacystin spontaneously hydrolyzes into clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, which appears to be the active inhibitor that reacts with the N-terminal threonine of subunit X (34Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Grenier L. Melandri F.D. Nunes S.L. Stein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7273-7276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Because lactacystin and the β-lactone appeared to be highly specific inhibitors that do not affect cysteine or serine proteases, they are potentially very useful research tools. We therefore examined whether they inhibit proteasomes that contain β-type subunits not expressed in neurons (e.g. LMP7, LMP2, and MECL-1), whether they reduce protein hydrolysis in vitro and in cells, and whether they can block MHC class I antigen presentation."
https://openalex.org/W1994369498,"A prior genetic study indicated that activity of Sir silencing proteins at a hypothetical AGE locus is essential for long life span. In this model, the SIR4-42 mutation would direct the Sir protein complex to the AGE locus, giving rise to a long life span. We show by indirect immunofluorescence that Sir3p and Sir4p are redirected to the nucleolus in the SIR4-42 mutant. Furthermore, this relocalization is dependent on both UTH4 a novel yeast gene that extends life span, and its homologue YGL023. Strikingly, the Sir complex is relocalized from telomeres to the nucleolus in old wild-type cells. We propose that the rDNA is the AGE locus and that nucleolar function is compromised in old yeast cells in a way that may be mitigated by targeting of Sir proteins to the nucleolus."
https://openalex.org/W2046290772,"The frequency(frq) gene encodes central components of the transcription/translation-based negative-feedback loop comprising the core of the Neurospora circadian oscillator; posttranscriptional regulation associated with FRQ is surprisingly complex. Alternative use of translation initiation sites gives rise to two forms of FRQ whose levels peak 4–6 hr following the peak of frq transcript. Each form of FRQ is progressively phosphorylated over the course of the day, thus providing a number of temporally distinct FRQ products. The kinetics of these regulatory processes suggest a view of the clock where relatively rapid events involving translational regulation in the synthesis of FRQ and negative feedback of FRQ on frq transcript levels are followed by slower posttranslational regulation, ultimately driving the turnover of FRQ and reactivation of the frq gene."
https://openalex.org/W2167557755,"The commitment complex is the first defined step in the yeast (S. cerevisiae) splicing pathway. It contains U1 snRNP as well as Mud2p, which resembles human U2AF65. In a genetic screen, we identified the yeast gene MSL-5, which is a novel commitment complex component. Genetic and biochemical criteria indicate a direct interaction between Msl5p and both Mud2p and the U1 snRNP protein Prp40p. This defines a bridge between the two ends of the intron. Msl5p (renamed BBP for branchpoint bridging protein) has a mammalian ortholog, the splicing factor SF1. Our results show that SF1 interacts strongly with human U2AF65, and that SF1 is a bona fide E complex component. This implies that aspects of these novel cross-intron protein–protein interactions are conserved between yeast and mammals."

CSB-deficient mice exhibit all of the CS repair characteristics: ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity, inactivation of transcription-coupled repair, unaffected global genome repair, and inability to resume RNA synthesis after UV exposure. Other CS features thought to involve the functioning of basal transcription/repair factor TFIIH, such as growth failure and neurologic dysfunction, are present in mild form. In contrast to the human syndrome, CSB-deficient mice show increased susceptibility to skin cancer. Our results demonstrate that transcription-coupled repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers contributes to the prevention of carcinogenesis in mice. Further, they suggest that the lack of cancer predisposition in CS patients is attributable to a global genome repair process that in humans is more effective than in rodents."

The α and β isoforms are abundantly expressed in the brain, with α making up as much as 2% of total protein in certain brain regions (3Erondu N.E. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3270-3277Google Scholar). CaMKII is particularly enriched in PSDs (4Ouimet C.C. McGuinness T.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5604-5608Google Scholar, 5Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin.

Earlier reports suggested that CaMKIIα constitutes as much as 50% of total PSD protein (8Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 945-949Google Scholar), but PSDs prepared from rapidly homogenized brains are only 2–3-fold enriched in CaMKIIα compared with whole forebrain extracts (3Erondu N.E. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3270-3277Google Scholar, 11Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Tanaka R. Tada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1529-1537Google Scholar). CaMKIIα knockout mice show impaired hippocampal long term potentiation, a cellular model for learning and memory (12Silva A.J. Stevens C.F. Tonegawa S. Wang Y. Science. 1992; 257: 201-206Google Scholar). Conversely, introduction of CaMKIIα into neurons augments postsynaptic responses and occludes further electrically induced long term potentiation (13Pettit D.L. Perlman S. Malinow R. Science. 1994; 266: 1881-1885Google Scholar, 14Lledo P.-M. Hjelmstad G.O. Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11175-11179Google Scholar). CaMKIIα undergoes calcium/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation on Thr286 in its regulatory domain, rendering the kinase partially calcium-independent (1Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1990; 31: 181-221Google Scholar, 2Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Google Scholar). This reaction has been proposed as a “molecular switch,” translating transient calcium elevation into prolonged kinase activity (15Lisman J.E. Goldring M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5320-5324Google Scholar, 16Fukunaga K. Muller D. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6119-6124Google Scholar), which becomes subject to regulation by protein phosphatases. In addition, Thr286 autophosphorylation promotes binding of CaMKIIα to a 190-kDa PSD protein by gel overlay (17McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Google Scholar). The present results extend these findings, demonstrating that Thr286autophosphorylation controls subcellular targeting of CaMKII in neurons with important functional consequences. CaMKIIα was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified (17McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Google Scholar). [35S]CaMKIIα (≈1200 cpm/pmol) was purified from cells metabolically labeled with 35 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 58 h prior to harvesting. Kinase was autophosphorylated in the presence (Thr286) or the absence (Thr305/Thr306) of calcium/calmodulin (0.2–0.6 and 0.6–1.2 mol 32P/mol kinase subunit, respectively) (17McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Google Scholar). Appropriate autophosphorylation of [35S]CaMKIIα with unlabeled ATP was confirmed by assaying calcium-dependent and -independent kinase activities (18Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7163-7170Google Scholar) using specific CaMKII substrate autocamtide-2 (10 μm) (19Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 59-70Google Scholar). PSDs were prepared from adult rat forebrains flash frozen within 45 s of euthanasia by detergent lysis of synaptosomes (20Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Google Scholar) except that 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin were included in all buffers. Synaptosomes were lysed in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 150 mm KCl, and a second subsequent sucrose gradient was omitted because it yielded no further purification. PSDs displayed typical “donut” morphology by video-enhanced differential-interference contrast microscopy (21Gamblin T.C. Williams Jr., R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 43-46Google Scholar). PSDs prepared in the absence or the presence of the protein phosphatase inhibitor microcystin-LR (1 μm) contained similar amounts of CaMKII protein (5–10% by quantitative immunoblotting (17McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Google Scholar)) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent CaMKII activity (100–150 nmol/min/mg with 10 μm autocamtide-2). Calcium-independent kinase activity was <2% and ≈10% of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity when PSDs were isolated in the absence or the presence of microcystin-LR, respectively. Therefore, CaMKII (Thr286) was almost completely dephosphorylated during normal PSD isolation (minus microcystin-LR). PSDs and 35S- or32P-labeled CaMKIIα were incubated at the indicated concentrations, temperatures, and times in Buffer A (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 μmmicrocystin-LR, and EDTA and EGTA at 2.5-fold molar excess over Mg2+ and Ca2+, respectively, carried over from the autophosphorylation. Binding was terminated by centrifugation of 90 μl through 0.5 ml of HEPES-buffered 0.5 m sucrose cushion into 20 μl of 10% glutaraldehyde in 0.6 m sucrose in a horizontal rotor (5000 × g, 45–60 s). The sucrose cushions were aspirated (excess ligand), and the tube bottoms (PSD pellets) were cut off and counted. Soluble [T286-32P]CaMKIIα (0.1–0.2 μm subunit) was incubated with 25–50 μg/ml isolated PSDs, whereas resuspended PSD·[T286-32P]CaMKIIα complexes (2–5 μg kinase/mg PSD) were incubated at a final concentration of 70 μg/ml PSD protein. Incubations were conducted for 30 min at 30 °C in Buffer A containing 1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1m NaCl, plus specific inhibitors or activators indicated below. Phosphatase activity was quantitated as trichloroacetic acid-soluble (20%, w/v) [32P]phosphate by scintillation counting. Blanks, with no PSDs in soluble substrate assays or 2.5 μm microcystin-LR in “PSD complex” substrate assays, were subtracted from all assays to control for [32P]phosphate present at the beginning of the incubation. Microcystin-LR completely blocked dephosphorylation in both assays. PP1 activity was calculated by subtraction of dephosphorylation measured in the presence of 0.2 μm Inhibitor-2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) from total “constitutive” dephosphorylation. PP2A activity was defined as activity inhibited by 2.5 nmokadaic acid (LC Laboratories); activity measured in the presence of 2.5 μm okadaic acid was assigned to unknown okadaic acid-resistant phosphatase(s); PP2C activity was defined as that stimulated by 10 mm magnesium acetate in the presence of 2.5 μm okadaic acid. Each protein phosphatase activity was expressed as a percentage of constitutive activity. Activities do not add up to 100% because inhibitor concentrations were chosen for optimum selectivity, not maximal efficacy. After incubation without or with 1 μm [T286-P]CaMKIIα, PSDs (0.3 mg/ml) were washed by pelleting twice and suspended in Buffer A containing 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μmmicrocystin-LR, and either 0.5 mm CaCl2, 6 μm calmodulin, or 1 mm EGTA. Phosphorylations were started by adding 0.5 μm [γ-32P]ATP (100 cpm/nmol) and stopped with 25 mm EDTA after 1 min on ice. GluR1 was immunoprecipitated (22McGlade-McCulloh E. Yamamoto H. Tan S.E. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1993; 362: 640-642Google Scholar) using antibody from Chemicon. No phosphorylated band co-migrating with GluR1 was detected in control precipitations with normal serum (not shown). Preparation and electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slice were described previously (23Lovinger D.M. White G. Weight F.F. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1372-1379Google Scholar). Four to six slices (400 μm, 3–6 week old rats) were divided into control/experimental hemislices and maintained in oxygenated, artificial cerebrospinal fluid for 60 min at 32 °C. After treatment with or without calyculin A (1 μm for 60 min) or tetraethylammonium (TEA) (25 mm for 10 min, 15-min wash) slices were flash frozen in liquid N2. Slices were homogenized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and the PSD-enriched particulate fraction was isolated by centrifugation (30 min at 14,000 × g). Crude PSD fractions were immunoblotted in triplicate for the indicated proteins using mixed alkaline phosphatase- and 125I-labeled secondary antibodies. Gamma counts for CaMKIIα/β and GluR1 in each lane were normalized to neurofilament heavy subunit (NF-H) immunoreactivity. Normalized values for experimental slices were expressed as a percentage of control slice values. Quantifications were performed in the linear range of the assay, which was determined separately for each protein by probing serial extract dilutions. Thr286 autophosphorylated CaMKIIα has been shown previously to bind a 190-kDa PSD protein on gel overlays (17McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Google Scholar). One criticism of gel overlays is that denatured proteins are partially renatured prior to binding, potentially exposing binding domain(s) that are cryptic in native protein or PSDs. To examine possible interactions of CaMKII under native conditions, we investigated binding of [35S]CaMKIIα to isolated PSDs (Fig.1 A). Calcium/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation at Thr306, generating the calcium-independent form of the kinase ([T286-P]CaMKII), enhancedin vitro binding about 5-fold. Calcium/calmodulin-independent autophosphorylation at Thr305/Thr306, inactivating the enzyme ([T306-P]CaMKII), reduced binding somewhat below nonphosphorylated kinase. Binding of [T286-P]CaMKII by PSDs was independent of calcium/calmodulin or magnesium (not shown). The apparent binding was not due to exchange of [35S]CaMKII for endogenous enzyme but represented true accumulation of CaMKIIα in the PSD (Fig.1 A, inset). [T286-P]CaMKIIα binding to PSDs was specific and may be functionally relevant, because the low levels of binding to mitochondria and membranes were unaffected by autophosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). [T286-P]CaMKIIα binding to PSDs was rapid, reaching saturation after 15 min at 4 °C (Fig. 1 B) or 5 min at 25 °C (not shown). Whereas nonphosphorylated kinase bound reversibly (≈25% dissociated in 3 h), binding of [T286-P]CaMKIIα appeared essentially irreversible under these conditions (<3% dissociated in 3 h) (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, although binding to PSDs was enhanced by autophosphorylation, continued phosphorylation was not required to maintain the interaction because dissociation was not accelerated when dephosphorylation of bound kinase by endogenous protein phosphatases was allowed (calcium-independent CaMKII activity 17 versus 10% ± microcystin-LR at 60 min) (Fig.1 C, open circle). This may explain why during PSD isolation CaMKII remains PSD-associated even though it is mostly dephosphorylated (see “Experimental Procedures”). In fact, [T286-P]CaMKIIα dissociated from PSDs as slowly as endogenous CaMKIIα measured by immunoblotting (not shown), suggesting thatin vitro and in vivo association of CaMKII with the PSD are mechanistically similar. The reason for this very slow reversibility is not known, but mechanisms such as proteolysis (24Rich D.P. Schworer C.M. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1990; 1: 107-116Google Scholar, 25Lisman J. Harris K. J. Physiol. Paris. 1994; 88: 193-195Google Scholar) may be required to dissociate CaMKII from the PSD in vivo. To assess the affinity of binding to PSDs, initial rates of [T286-32P]CaMKIIα binding were measured in the absence or the presence of nonradioactive kinase. Whereas non-P CaMKIIα and [T306-P]CaMKIIα were poor competitors, [T286-P]CaMKIIα was an effective competitor (apparent IC50 ≈1.1 μm) (Fig. 1 D). Because this IC50is approximately 10 times lower than the average concentration of CaMKII in forebrain (3Erondu N.E. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3270-3277Google Scholar, 17McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Google Scholar), sufficient CaMKII exists for binding to be regulated in vivo. Significantly, this IC50 is very similar to the affinity of [T286-P]CaMKIIα for p190 estimated by gel overlay (17McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Google Scholar); p190 is therefore a candidate for targeting the calcium-independent form of CaMKII to PSDs. It seemed important to determine which protein phosphatases (PPs) influence the lifetime of calcium-independent CaMKII in the PSD. CaMKII can be dephosphorylated by purified PP1 (26Schworer C.M. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8581-8584Google Scholar), PP2A (27Lai Y. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4253-4257Google Scholar), and PP2C (28Fukunaga K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 133-137Google Scholar), but not by PP2B. Each of these major phosphatases is present in PSDs, although only PP1 is enriched in this fraction (29Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Google Scholar). Their activities can be distinguished based on requirements for divalent cations and sensitivity to specific inhibitors (30Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-398Google Scholar). With soluble exogenous [T286-32P]CaMKIIα as the substrate, the PP2A:PP1 activity ratio was 3:1 (Fig. 2), in agreement with previous data (29Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Google Scholar). However, under these conditions, 5–10% of the substrate binds to PSDs. When assays were repeated using [T286-32P]-CaMKIIα previously bound to the PSD as a substrate, PP1 appeared to be mostly responsible for dephosphorylation (PP2A:PP1 activity ratio, 1:6; Fig. 2). 2Total activities in soluble and PSD-bound CaMKII phosphatase assays were 7.8 and 0.6 pmol/min/mg, respectively. It is difficult to interpret this difference because both substrate and enzyme are immobilized on the PSD in the latter assay. The apparent decrease in phosphatase activity after binding may reflect a preferential loss of the PP2A component or may simply be due to restricted mobility of PSD-bound CaMKII. This is consistent with previous reports that dephosphorylation of CaMKII endogenous to PSDs is catalyzed by PP1 (29Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Google Scholar, 31Shields S.M. Ingebritsen T.S. Kelly P.T. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3414-3422Google Scholar, 32Dosemeci A. Reese T.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 550-555Google Scholar); however, CaMKII endogenous to isolated PSDs (i.e. in vivotranslocated CaMKII) may represent a modified form of the kinase (46Wu K. Huang Y. Adler J. Black I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3015-3019Google Scholar), possibly due to post-mortem ischemic conditions (11Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Tanaka R. Tada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1529-1537Google Scholar, 47Churn S.B. Sankaran B. Haley B.E. DeLorenzo R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 934-940Google Scholar). The present data demonstrate that interaction of the calcium-independent form of CaMKII with PSDs directly regulates its inactivation, in that binding to the PSD in vitro converts CaMKII from a PP2A substrate to a substrate for PSD-bound PP1. The mechanism for this change in protein phosphatases responsible for dephosphorylating Thr286 is unknown. CaMKII may undergo a conformational change after binding to PSDs that favors dephosphorylation by PP1. Alternatively, dephosphorylation by PP1 may be enhanced by physical proximity in the PSD. AKAP79 is a protein that is thought to anchor inactive forms of protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and PP2B to PSDs (33Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Google Scholar, 34Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Google Scholar). In contrast, CaMKII bound to PSDs remains active, because binding of [T286-P]CaMKIIα to PSDs increased calcium-independent activity toward autocamtide-2 peptide substrate by an amount corresponding to binding of [T286-32P]CaMKIIα quantified in parallel reactions (not shown). More importantly, binding of [T286-P]CaMKIIα (≈10 μg/mg PSD protein) led to a ≈2-fold increase of calcium-dependent phosphorylation and a ≈13-fold increase of calcium-independent phosphorylation of many proteins in PSDs (Fig.3 A). In the presence of calcium/calmodulin, CaMKII phosphorylates GluR1 subunits of AMPA-type glutamate receptors in PSDs, increasing channel permeability and postsynaptic responses (22McGlade-McCulloh E. Yamamoto H. Tan S.E. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1993; 362: 640-642Google Scholar). GluR1 immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with PSDs phosphorylated in the absence of calcium, with or without bound [T286-P]CaMKIIα. Phosphorylated GluR1 was immunoprecipitated only from PSDs to which [T286-P]CaMKIIα had been bound (Fig. 3 B), identifying GluR1 as a substrate for the PSD-bound, autophosphorylated, calcium-independent form of CaMKII. Brain injuries involving increased intracellular calcium such as ischemia/hypoxia (11Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Tanaka R. Tada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1529-1537Google Scholar, 35Aronowski J. Grotta J.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 709: 103-110Google Scholar), hypoglycemia (36Hu B.R. Kurihara J. Wieloch T. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1361-1369Google Scholar), and excitotoxic insults (37Morioka M. Fukunaga K. Nagahiro S. Kurino M. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2132-2139Google Scholar) cause CaMKII translocation to the cytoskeleton, including PSDs. Ischemia also transiently increases calcium-independent CaMKII activity (38Zalewska T. Domanska-Janik K. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 637-641Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that Thr286autophosphorylation is sufficient for translocation of CaMKII to occur in neurons. Calyculin A, a cell-permeant protein phosphatase inhibitor, was shown previously to increase Thr286 phosphorylation in hippocampal slices (39Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Google Scholar) without affecting general excitability or viability (40Figurov A. Boddeke H. Muller D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1035-1041Google Scholar). Here, calyculin A increased calcium-independent CaMKII activity in hippocampal slice extracts from 25.6 ± 1.2% to 43.4 ± 3.7% (n = 6, p < 0.01), accompanied by a >2-fold increase in CaMKII associated with PSD-enriched fractions (Fig. 4, A andC). We next induced a form of long term potentiation with the K+-channel blocker TEA (41Aniksztejn L. Ben-Ari Y. Nature. 1991; 349: 67-69Google Scholar). There was a 83.6 ± 21.7% (n = 4, p < 0.05) enhancement of transmission at CA3-CA1 synapses (Fig. 4 B) 15 min after TEA removal, accompanied by increased calcium-independent CaMKII activity (20.3 ± 1.9% to 26.7 ± 4.2%, n = 5, p = 0.07) and a 70–80% increase of CaMKII protein in the PSD-enriched fraction (Fig. 4 C). Thus, CaMKII translocation occurs in intact neurons in response to treatments that induce CaMKII autophosphorylation and potentiate synaptic transmission. In conclusion, the present data suggest a molecular mechanism for association of CaMKII with the PSD that is likely to be important in physiological and pathological states. Stimulation of CaMKII autophosphorylation by calcium influx into dendritic spines may increase the amount of active CaMKII in the PSD resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of GluR1 and other key substrates, in turn leading to an enhanced postsynaptic response. In addition, translocation may sequester CaMKII away from the cytosolic phosphatase activity of PP2A, making it available for dephosphorylation by PSD-bound PP1 only. Interestingly, PP1 itself is highly regulated by phosphorylation and association with targeting and inhibitory subunits (42Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Google Scholar) and is also involved in synaptic plasticity (43Mulkey R.M. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Google Scholar). Finally, because CaMKII has been proposed to play a structural role in the PSD (5Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 732-737Google Scholar), translocation of substantial amounts of cytosolic CaMKII to the PSD in response to calcium signals may result in long term changes in synapse morphology (44Greenough W.T. West R.W. DeVoogd T.J. Science. 1978; 202: 1096-1098Google Scholar, 45Geinisman Y. deToledo-Morrell L. Morrell F. Brain Res. 1991; 566: 77-88Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2000293147,"Although the La autoantigen binds to the 3' ends of all nascent polymerase III transcripts, its function in vivo has long been unclear. Although S. cerevisiae cells lacking the La protein homolog Lhp1p are viable, cells containing a mutation that disrupts the anticodon stem of tRNA(Ser)CGA require Lhp1p for growth. We demonstrate that for the wild-type pre-tRNA(Ser)CGA and other pre-tRNAs, Lhp1p is required for the normal endonucleolytic removal of the 3' trailer sequence. In cells lacking Lhp1p, the 3' trailer is removed by exonuclease(s). Although maturation of the mutant pre-tRNA(Ser)CGA requires Lhp1p, introduction of a second mutation that restores base pairing eliminates the requirement. We propose that binding by Lhp1p stabilizes pre-tRNAs in conformations that allow the 3' endonucleolytic cleavage to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2056296605,"Two forms of FRQ, a central component of the Neurospora circadian clock, arise through alternative in-frame initiation of translation. Either form alone suffices for a functional clock at some temperatures, but both are always necessary for robust rhythmicity. Temperature regulates the ratio of FRQ forms by favoring different initiation codons at different temperatures; when either initiation codon is eliminated, the temperature range permissive for rhythmicity is demonstrably reduced. This temperature-influenced choice of translation-initiation site represents a novel adaptive mechanism that extends the physiological temperature range over which clocks function. Additionally, a temperature-dependent threshold level of FRQ is required to establish the feedback loop comprising the oscillator. These data may explain how temperature limits permissive for rhythmicity are established, thus providing a molecular understanding for a basic characteristic of circadian clocks."

In addition, the functional inactivation of the caspase-3 gene in knock-out mice results in the profound absence of apoptosis in certain tissues and lethality shortly after birth (18Kuida K.

Therefore, caspase-3 appears to be an extremely biologically relevant apoptotic protease.All caspase family members are initially synthesized as inactive precursors and require proteolytic processing themselves to generate the two subunits that form the active protease. This suggests that the apoptotic machinery may be regulated, in part, by a proteolytic cascade (for review, see Ref. 19Nicholson D.W. Nat.

In the case of caspase-3, the mature enzyme is formed from 17 kDa (p17) and 12 kDa (p12) subunits, which are produced from a 32-kDa precursor (4Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

However, the process of how the caspase-3 precursor is converted into the mature caspase-3 remains uncharacterized, and the cellular proteases that cleave these sites have not been identified.We have recently shown that when the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line was induced to undergo apoptosis by exposure to staurosporine (STS), one of the early biochemical events was the conversion of the 32-kDa caspase-3 precursor into the mature protease that was responsible for the subsequent proteolysis of DNA-PKcs (9Han Z.

In addition, we have also demonstrated that apoptosis in HL-60 cells triggered by STS was independent of the synthesis of new proteins (20Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that HL-60 cells constitutively express all of the factors necessary for apoptosis including the caspase-3 precursor proteases. Therefore, cell extracts from HL-60 cells should provide an ideal system for the identification of the proteases that can catalyze the conversion of the caspase-3 precursor protein into an active apoptotic protease.A recent study by Liu et al.

In our study, we have modified thisin vitro assay system and investigated the process of proteolytic processing of caspase-3. Our results show that this process appears to involve two proteolytic steps and to be catalyzed by two different proteases. Lastly, our study provides insight into why certain protease inhibitors, including the caspase-3 selective inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, can block apoptosis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that in a cell-free assay system cytochrome c induces the proteolytic conversion of the 32-kDa caspase-3 precursor into the mature caspase-3. Furthermore, our results showed that this process involved two sequential cleavage steps and that each step was catalyzed by a unique proteolytic activity. Finally, our results provide additional insight into the mechanisms by which protease inhibitors block apoptosis.Proteolytic Processing of Caspase-3Molecular cloning of the caspase-3 gene and biochemical analysis of the purified, active caspase-3 showed that caspase-3 was initially synthesized as an inactive 32-kDa precursor (4Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Cleavage at the IETD/S site appeared to occur first, yielding a mature p12 subunit and a p20 intermediate product. However, it should be pointed out that since good antibodies that can recognize the p12 subunit are not available now, the exact status of this subunit during the assay period remains speculative. Subsequently, a cleavage occurred at the ESMD↓S site in the p20 intermediate, yielding the mature p17 subunit. Together, the p12 and p17 subunits then form the mature caspase-3 (Fig. 5). Thus, blocking the cleavage at IETD↓S with Ac-IETD-CHO, CrmA, or TPCK completely abrogated the appearance of any processed products of caspase-3, whereas blocking the cleavage at ESMD↓S with Ac-EMSD-CHO or Ac-DEVD-CHO allowed the primary cleavage at IETD↓S to occur but not the secondary cleavage at EMSD↓S (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, our data provide strong evidence for a sequential two-step processing mechanism.Figure 5A two-step mechanism for proteolytic processing of caspase-3 (cpp32). The first cleavage occurs at the IETD/S site that generates the p20/p12 intermediate. This cleavage is inhibitable by CrmA, TPCK, and Ac-IETD-CHO. The second cleavage occurs at the ESMD/S site to generate the fully active p17/p12 protease. This cleavage may be autocatalytic and is inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO and AC-EMSD-CHO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Nature of the Protease That Cleaves the IETD↓S SiteOur results suggest that the protease activity required for the cleavage step at the IETD↓S site in the 32-kDa caspase-3 precursor has some novel properties. First, it is sensitive to the sequence-specific peptide inhibitor, Ac-IETD-CHO (Fig. 3 B), and it is also sensitive to CrmA and TPCK (Fig. 4). CrmA is a cowpox viral protein that can inhibit several members of the caspase family including caspase-1 (28Ray C.K. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesen G.S. Pickup D.J.

First, Northern blot analysis of HL-60 cells found no evidence for the expression of the caspase-1 gene (data not shown). Second, the presence of the highly selective caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CHO (22Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R.

Third, the cleavage at the IETD↓S site proceeded normally in the presence of the caspase-3 inhibitor (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, it is unlikely that caspase-1 or caspase-3-like proteases are involved with this event. It remains to be seen if other caspases, such as caspase-6 and caspase 8, might be responsible for cleaving the caspase-3 IETD↓S site. This is potentially likely since both activated caspase-6 (33Orth K. O'Rourke K. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Rev. 1970; 50: 244-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and while it has not been shown to have an inhibitory effect on caspases, it has been observed, in some studies, to have an inhibitory effect on apoptosis (25Chow S.C. Weis M. Kass G.E.N. Holmstrom T.H. Eriksson J.E. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 264: 134-138Google Scholar, 26Fearnhead H.O. Rivett A.J. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M.

Thus, it is possible that TPCK, at the concentrations used in our assay, directly inhibited the protease that cleaves at the IETD↓S site, thus inhibiting the processing of the caspase-3 precursor (Figs. 4 A and 5). If this is true, then both TPCK and CrmA may be inhibiting the same protease. Alternatively, it is also possible that the TPCK-sensitive protease is different from that of CrmA. This would suggest that the TPCK-sensitive protease acts upstream of the CrmA-sensitive protease. Experiments to test this possibility are underway.The Nature of the Protease That Cleaves the ESMD↓S Site in the p20 Intermediate PeptideOne surprising finding in this study is the observation that the highly selective caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO (5Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5504-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), blocked only the second cleavage step at the ESMD↓S site in the p20 peptide (Fig. 3 C). This prevented the conversion of the p20 intermediate peptide into the mature p17 subunit. Apparently, the inhibitory effect of Ac-DEVD-CHO was selective upon this cleavage step, since it had no observable effect on the first cleavage step at the IETD↓S site in the 32-kDa precursor (Fig.3 C). This suggests that, unlike the protease activity that was required for cleaving the IETD↓S site, either caspase-3 itself or, more likely, a caspase-3-like proteolytic activity is specifically required for cleaving the ESMD↓S site. It could be argued that the HL-60 cell S-100 extract contained a trace amount of endogenous, active caspase-3, which was responsible for generating the p17 subunit once the p20 product was available. However, this appears to be unlikely for the following reasons. First, we have not been able to detect the presence of p17 in the untreated S-100 extract even in Western blots with overloaded protein samples (data not shown). Second, the effective concentration of Ac-DEVD-CHO (50–100 nm; see Fig.3 C) that was required for the inhibition of this protease activity was relatively high. In assays that have been described for assessing the inhibitor potency of the Ac-DEVD-CHO peptide on purified caspase-3, the K i values have been estimated to be less than 1 nm (5Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar). The fact that Ac-DEVD-CHO inhibited the protease activity that cleaves the ESMD↓S site in a range of 50–100 nm suggests that this activity could not be attributed to the presence of a trace amount of the active caspase-3 in the extract. Rather, it is likely that this activity is simply caspase-3-like.Aternatively, it could be speculated that p20 and p12 may form a partially active intermediate protease that undergoes autocatalysis at the ESMD↓S site, producing the fully active caspase-3 consisting of p17 and p12 (Fig. 5). Unlike the fully active caspase-3, which is extremely sensitive to the peptide inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (5Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar), the partially active p20/p12 intermediate protease may have a much lower affinity for the Ac-DEVD-CHO peptide and thus be less sensitive to it than the fully active p17/p12 protease. Experimentally, it should be possible to prove or disapprove this hypothesis. Introduction of a point mutation into the ESMD↓S site that makes it uncleavable should give rise to the production of only p12 and p20 peptides. If the p20/p12 complex has any proteolytic activity, then it may be able to quantify this using caspase-3 substrates such as PARP (5Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K.

All three inhibitors have been shown, by various investigators, to block apoptosis in a variety of cells under many different treatments (6Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z.

Cell Res. 1995; 221: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The reason CrmA and Ac-DEVD-CHO block apoptosis was thought to be due to their direct inhibitory effect on the active apoptotic caspase-3 (5Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

The results of this study have revealed that both inhibitors are also capable of preventing the conversion of the inactive caspase-3 precursor into the active protease.Finally, although TPCK has been found to inhibit apoptosis in several studies (25Chow S.C. Weis M. Kass G.E.N. Holmstrom T.H. Eriksson J.E. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 264: 134-138Google Scholar, 26Fearnhead H.O. Rivett A.J. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M.

Immunol. 1995; : 4741-4748PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism by which it mediates this effect was unclear. In particular, it has been well characterized that TPCK has no direct inhibitory effect on caspase-3 (5Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar, 9Han Z. Malik N.

Therefore, we suggest that at least one mechanism by which TPCK prevents apoptosis is that it can inhibit a novel protease that participates in the process of the conversion of the caspase-3 precursor to the active apoptotic protease. In recent years, evidence has accumulated that the degradation of certain proteins by members of the caspase family is a general biochemical event taking place in cells undergoing apoptosis (for reviews, see Refs. 1Martin S.J.

Antibodies prepared against peptides from the predicted protein sequence detected a approximately 350 kDa protein corresponding to the open reading frame, which was absent in 13/23 A-T homozygotes. Subcellular fractionation, immunoelectronmicroscopy and immunofluorescence showed that the ATM protein is present in the nucleus and cytoplasmic vesicles. This distribution did not change after irradiation. We also provide evidence that ATM protein binds to p53 and this association is defective in A-T cells compatible with the defective p53 response in these cells. These results provide further support for a role for the ATM protein as a sensor of DNA damage and in a more general role in cell signalling, compatible with the broader phenotype of the syndrome."

Biological activities and post-receptor signaling mechanisms of the TRAF proteins are still obscure. TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, when overexpressed, activate NF-κB (11Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Google Scholar, 13Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V.

Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Google Scholar). The N-terminal RING finger motif is necessary for both of these activities.In the course of Amgen EST project, we discovered a novel TNFR-related protein we have named ATAR (anotherTRAF-associated receptor). Expression of ATAR is highly tissue-specific. To explore its biological function, we applied the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for signaling proteins that associate with the intracellular domain of ATAR. We found that ATAR interacts with both TRAF2 and TRAF5. Like most other TRAF-binding TNFR family members, ATAR also mediates NF-κB activation.RESULTSA murine cDNA sequence that appeared to encode a portion of a novel TNFR family member was identified during the Amgen EST program. A full-length cDNA isolated from a mouse intestinal cDNA library encodes a 276-amino acid protein we called ATAR that has a signal peptide and a single transmembrane region (Fig.1 A). The extracellular domain contains three cysteine-rich repeats and is most homologous to TNFR2. The receptor has a short cytoplasmic tail of only 46 amino acids. During the screen, we also isolated different spliced products that result in deletions within the extracellular domain or generation of soluble receptor forms (Fig. 1 B). However, none of the soluble forms comprise complete cysteine repeats, suggesting they might be defective in ligand recognition. The human counterpart of the receptor was subsequently isolated from a bone marrow cDNA library. Amino acid comparisons demonstrated that the mouse and human homologs share 51 and 25% identity within their extracellular and intracellular domains, respectively.Tissue distribution of mouse ATAR was examined in an RNase protection assay (Fig. 2). Among the tissues examined, ATAR mRNA was highly expressed in spleen, thymus, bone marrow, lung, and small intestine. Very low levels of expression were detected in brain, skeletal muscle, and stomach. Similar tissue distribution patterns were observed for human ATAR mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis (data not shown).Figure 2RNase protection assay of murine ATAR. A 300-base pair (bp) 32P-labeled fragment was used as probe in the RNase protection analysis of mouse total RNA samples as indicated. A 250-base pair protected fragment was generated after RNase treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To explore the biological function of ATAR, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to search for signaling proteins that interact with the ATAR intracellular domain. Human B lymphocyte and mouse lymph node libraries were screened with bait containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the human ATAR intracellular domain. A total of 40 million transformants were screened and positive clones obtained encoded TRAF5 or TRAF2. All of these TRAF5 and TRAF2 clones contained a complete C-terminal TRAF domain, consistent with previous reports that this domain mediates receptor interaction. We also examined the interaction of ATAR with TRAF1 and TRAF3 by yeast two-hybrid interaction assays. No interaction of ATAR with TRAF1 or TRAF3 was detected in this assay (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3ATAR Interaction with TRAF proteins. A, human and mouse ATAR interact with TRAF5 and TRAF2. Expression vectors encoding full-length or deletion mutants of human or mouse ATAR intracellular domain fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain were cotransformed into HF7C yeast strain with vectors expressing GAL4 activation domain fused with TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, or TRAF5 proteins. Yeast transformation mixtures were plated on synthetic dextrose plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and containing 20 mm 3-aminotriazole. + indicates growth on the selection plates and also expression of β-galactosidase.

Four conserved amino acids within the TRAF-binding sites of human CD40 and ATAR were aligned. Each of the four amino acids within ATAR was replaced with alanine individually. The intracellular domain containing each point mutation was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and the fusion protein was tested for its interaction with TRAF2 and TRAF5 in the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay as described above. (+) indicates growth on the selection plates and also expression of β-galactosidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because human and mouse ATAR are poorly conserved within their intracellular domains, we tested the ability of mouse ATAR to interact with TRAF proteins. Like its human homolog, mouse ATAR interacted with TRAF2 and TRAF5 but not TRAF1 or TRAF3 (Fig. 3 A). Sequence alignment revealed a stretch of nine conserved amino acids (residues 261–269 in mouse and 264–272 in human) among otherwise largely unrelated intracellular domains (Fig. 1 A), suggesting the importance of this short conserved region in TRAF recognition. To further localize the TRAF-interacting region, we fused residues 224–263 or residues 264–283 of the human ATAR intracellular domain to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and tested their interaction with TRAF proteins. The GAL4DB-ATAR(264–283) fusion protein containing the conserved nine-amino acid stretch was able to bind both TRAF5 and TRAF2. Therefore, the C-terminal 20 amino acids of ATAR were sufficient for TRAF interaction. Interestingly, the last four of these nine amino acids are conserved in the TRAF-interacting region of CD40 (Fig.3 B). Double mutations of CD40 Glu253 and Thr254 to alanine abolished the TRAF interaction (21Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes & Development. 1996; 10: 963-973Google Scholar). Each of the four conserved amino acids of ATAR was substituted with alanine, and each point mutant was tested for its interaction with TRAF2 and TRAF5 (Fig. 3 B). The glutamic acid to alanine substitution at position 271 abolished ATAR interaction with the TRAF proteins. However, the other point mutants interacted as well as the wild type receptor with TRAF2 and TRAF5.We then examined the interaction of ATAR with TRAF proteins in mammalian cells. An expression vector that directs the synthesis of full-length ATAR was co-transfected with a FLAG-tagged TRAF2 or TRAF5 expression vector into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Cell lysates from each transfection were immunoprecipitated with either preimmune serum or a polyclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of ATAR. Western analysis of the immunoprecipitates were performed with a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope. Both Flag-TRAF2 and Flag-TRAF5 specifically co-precipitated with ATAR (Fig.4). Therefore ATAR is another TRAF-interacting TNFR family member.Figure 4Co-immunoprecipitation of ATAR with TRAF2 and TRAF5. 293 cells (3 × 105) were transfected with indicated the combinations of expression vectors for human ATAR and Flag epitope-tagged TRAF2 and TRAF5. After 24 h, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with preimmune serum (lanes 1 and 3) or antibody against ATAR extracellular domain (lanes 2 and 4). Co-precipitating TRAF proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody against Flag epitope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interaction of ATAR with TRAF2 and TRAF5 suggests that like TNFR2 and CD40, ATAR may also mediate NF-κB activation. To test this possibility, a NF-κB-dependent reporter construct was transfected into 293 cells. Co-transfection with a ATAR expression vector resulted in an approximately 10-fold induction of luciferase activity as compared with the vector transfection control (Fig.5 A). This NF-κB activation requires ATAR interaction with TRAF proteins, because expression of ATAR(E271A), the point mutant that no longer interacts with TRAF2 or TRAF5, failed to activate NF-κB (Fig. 5 A).Figure 5NF-κB activation induced by ATAR. A, activation of NF-κB in ATAR transfected 293 cells. 293 cells (3 × 105) were transfected with 1 μg of pELAM-luc reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of pRSV-βgal, and 2 μg of control, ATAR, or ATAR(E271A) expression vector. Luciferase activities were measured after 24 h and normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression levels. The values (mean ± SD) represent luciferase activities relative to vector transfection for representative experiments performed in duplicate. B, inhibition of ATAR-mediated NF-κB activation by TRAF5(205–558) mutant. 293 cells (3 × 105) were transfected with 1 μg of pELAM-luc reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of pRSV-βgal, 1 μg of ATAR expression vector, and the indicated amounts of TRAF5(205–558) expression vector and supplemented with vector DNA to reach a total of 3.5 μg of DNA. Luciferase activities were measured as described above. C, synergistic activation of NF-κB by ATAR and TRAF5 293 cells (3 × 105) were transfected with 1 μg of pELAM-luc reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of pRSV-βgal, 1 μg of indicated combinations of expression vectors for ATAR, TRAF5, or TRAF2, and vector DNA to reach a total of 3.5 μg of DNA. Luciferase activities were measured as described above. Western analysis indicated similar protein expression levels in all samples (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Both TRAF2 and TRAF5, when overexpressed, activate NF-κB. This activity depends on their N-terminal RING finger and zinc finger motifs (11Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Google Scholar, 16Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Google Scholar). We generated a TRAF5(205–558) truncation mutant lacking the RING and zinc finger motifs. In a dose-dependent experiment, co-expression of TRAF5(205–558) deletion mutant with ATAR in 293 cells blocks NF-κB activation induced by ATAR overexpression (Fig. 5 B). Similar inhibitory effects were observed when ATAR was co-expressed with TRAF2 RING and zinc finger deletion mutant (data not shown). These dominant negative inhibitory effects suggest potential involvement of both TRAF5 and TRAF2 in ATAR-mediated NF-κB activation pathway.To further examine the effects of TRAF5 and TRAF2 expression on ATAR-mediated NF-κB activation, we co-expressed ATAR with full-length TRAF5 or TRAF2 proteins in 293 cells. Interestingly, we found that co-expression of ATAR and TRAF5 resulted in a synergistic activation of NF-κB (Fig. 5 C). On the contrary, no synergy was detected when ATAR was co-expressed with TRAF2 (Fig.5 C). We also examined ATAR(E271A), a point mutant that no longer binds with TRAF proteins. When co-expressed with TRAF5 or TRAF2, ATAR(E271A) did not affect NF-κB activation induced by TRAF5 or TRAF2 (data not shown). This specific synergistic activation by ATAR and TRAF5 suggests that TRAF5 plays a unique role in ATAR signaling.DISCUSSIONWe report here the identification of a novel TNFR family member. ATAR is the smallest reported member of this receptor superfamily so far. The human and mouse homologs are poorly conserved (45% identity) as compared with other members within the family. For example, TNFR1, TNFR2, Fas, and CD40 share 65, 64, 51, and 63% identity in the two species, respectively. This poor sequence conservation is especially evident in the region of the short cytoplasmic tail (25% identity). However, we argued against the possibility that they may represent distinct receptors based on two factors: 1) no other human counterparts were isolated during cDNA library screening with mouse ATAR, and 2) distinct receptors within this family share approximately 25% between each other.Despite the limited homology, both human and mouse ATAR intracellular domains interact with the same TRAF proteins. This TRAF-binding activity resides in the C-terminal 20 amino acids of human ATAR, because GAL4-ATAR(264–283) is still able to interact with TRAF5. Interestingly, within this region is a stretch of nine amino acids well aligned with the corresponding region in the mouse receptor. Similar amino acid residues have been shown to be crucial in TRAF-recognition by TNFR2, CD40, and CD30. This finding should help shed light on the structural requirements of TRAF-receptor interactions.Overexpression of ATAR in mammalian cells results in NF-κB activation. This activation depends on the interaction of ATAR with TRAF proteins, because a TRAF-binding deficient mutant (E271A) fails to activate NF-κB. In addition, we found that co-expression of ATAR with TRAF5 but not TRAF2 resulted in synergistic activation of NF-κB. These results suggest that TRAF5 contributes to ATAR-mediated NF-κB activation. However, it does not rule out involvement of TRAF2 in this process, because TRAF2 is ubiquitously expressed and might not be a limiting factor in 293 cells.ATAR is identical to a recently reported protein (HVEM) that was identified as a receptor for mediating viral entry of herpes simplex virus-1 and -2 (22Montgomer R.I. Warner M.S. Lum B.J. Spear P.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine if this viral entry process activates ATAR and how cellular responses mediated by the receptor (e.g. NF-κB activation) affect the viral life cycle. It is noteworthy that latent infection membrane protein-1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus also interacts with TRAF proteins through its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Possible pathogenic roles of ATAR and TRAF proteins in herpes simplex virus infection await further study.ATAR is mainly expressed in spleen, thymus, bone marrow, and small intestine, all tissues in which lymphoid cells are enriched. This expression pattern suggests that ATAR plays a role in development or regulation of the immune system. This notion is supported by the fact that ATAR mediates activation of NF-κB, which in turn activates a battery of genes crucial to immune regulation (23Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar). Among the known TNF-like ligands tested, we did not detect interaction of ATAR with TNFα, lymphotoxin α and β, or CD40 ligand (data not shown). Identification of its cognate ligand will greatly improve our understanding of the physiological role of ATAR. The TNFR 1The abbreviations used are: TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. superfamily includes, among others, TNFR1, TNFR2, Fas, NGFR, CD40, and CD30 (1Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Google Scholar). Receptors within this group share a similar extracellular domain architecture of multiple cysteine-rich repeats, each containing about 40 amino acids with six cysteines. However, no significant homology is found within the intracellular domains with the exception of the death domain shared by TNFR1, Fas, and Wsl-1 (DR3) (2Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Google Scholar, 3Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Google Scholar, 4Kitson J. Raven T. Jiang Y.P. Goeddel D.V. Giles K. Pun K.T.

Science. 1996; 274: 990-992Google Scholar). Post-receptor signaling mechanisms utilized by the TNFR superfamily have recently begun to emerge with the discovery of two distinct classes of receptor-associated proteins. The death domain proteins TRADD, RIP, and FADD interact with the death domain of TNFR1 or Fas following ligand-mediated receptor aggregation (6Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar, 7Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

The N-terminal death effector domain of FADD then recruits Caspase-8 (Flice/MACH), an ICE-like cysteine protease, to the receptor complex (6Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar, 7Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Google Scholar). This process activates the apoptotic protease cascade and results in rapid onset of apoptosis. The second group of signaling molecules, the TRAF proteins, directly interact with TNFR2, CD40, CD30, and lymphotoxin-β receptor (9Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D.

A, activation of NF-κB in ATAR transfected 293 cells. 293 cells (3 × 105) were transfected with 1 μg of pELAM-luc reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of pRSV-βgal, and 2 μg of control, ATAR, or ATAR(E271A) expression vector. Luciferase activities were measured after 24 h and normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression levels. The values (mean ± SD) represent luciferase activities relative to vector transfection for representative experiments performed in duplicate. B, inhibition of ATAR-mediated NF-κB activation by TRAF5(205–558) mutant. 293 cells (3 × 105) were transfected with 1 μg of pELAM-luc reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of pRSV-βgal, 1 μg of ATAR expression vector, and the indicated amounts of TRAF5(205–558) expression vector and supplemented with vector DNA to reach a total of 3.5 μg of DNA. Luciferase activities were measured as described above. C, synergistic activation of NF-κB by ATAR and TRAF5 293 cells (3 × 105) were transfected with 1 μg of pELAM-luc reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of pRSV-βgal, 1 μg of indicated combinations of expression vectors for ATAR, TRAF5, or TRAF2, and vector DNA to reach a total of 3.5 μg of DNA. Luciferase activities were measured as described above. Western analysis indicated similar protein expression levels in all samples (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Both TRAF2 and TRAF5, when overexpressed, activate NF-κB. This activity depends on their N-terminal RING finger and zinc finger motifs (11Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Google Scholar, 16Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Google Scholar). We generated a TRAF5(205–558) truncation mutant lacking the RING and zinc finger motifs. In a dose-dependent experiment, co-expression of TRAF5(205–558) deletion mutant with ATAR in 293 cells blocks NF-κB activation induced by ATAR overexpression (Fig. 5 B). Similar inhibitory effects were observed when ATAR was co-expressed with TRAF2 RING and zinc finger deletion mutant (data not shown). These dominant negative inhibitory effects suggest potential involvement of both TRAF5 and TRAF2 in ATAR-mediated NF-κB activation pathway.To further examine the effects of TRAF5 and TRAF2 expression on ATAR-mediated NF-κB activation, we co-expressed ATAR with full-length TRAF5 or TRAF2 proteins in 293 cells. Interestingly, we found that co-expression of ATAR and TRAF5 resulted in a synergistic activation of NF-κB (Fig. 5 C). On the contrary, no synergy was detected when ATAR was co-expressed with TRAF2 (Fig.5 C). We also examined ATAR(E271A), a point mutant that no longer binds with TRAF proteins. When co-expressed with TRAF5 or TRAF2, ATAR(E271A) did not affect NF-κB activation induced by TRAF5 or TRAF2 (data not shown). This specific synergistic activation by ATAR and TRAF5 suggests that TRAF5 plays a unique role in ATAR signaling. A murine cDNA sequence that appeared to encode a portion of a novel TNFR family member was identified during the Amgen EST program. A full-length cDNA isolated from a mouse intestinal cDNA library encodes a 276-amino acid protein we called ATAR that has a signal peptide and a single transmembrane region (Fig.1 A). The extracellular domain contains three cysteine-rich repeats and is most homologous to TNFR2. The receptor has a short cytoplasmic tail of only 46 amino acids. During the screen, we also isolated different spliced products that result in deletions within the extracellular domain or generation of soluble receptor forms (Fig. 1 B). However, none of the soluble forms comprise complete cysteine repeats, suggesting they might be defective in ligand recognition. The human counterpart of the receptor was subsequently isolated from a bone marrow cDNA library. Amino acid comparisons demonstrated that the mouse and human homologs share 51 and 25% identity within their extracellular and intracellular domains, respectively. Tissue distribution of mouse ATAR was examined in an RNase protection assay (Fig. 2). Among the tissues examined, ATAR mRNA was highly expressed in spleen, thymus, bone marrow, lung, and small intestine. Very low levels of expression were detected in brain, skeletal muscle, and stomach. Similar tissue distribution patterns were observed for human ATAR mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). To explore the biological function of ATAR, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to search for signaling proteins that interact with the ATAR intracellular domain. Human B lymphocyte and mouse lymph node libraries were screened with bait containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the human ATAR intracellular domain. A total of 40 million transformants were screened and positive clones obtained encoded TRAF5 or TRAF2. All of these TRAF5 and TRAF2 clones contained a complete C-terminal TRAF domain, consistent with previous reports that this domain mediates receptor interaction. We also examined the interaction of ATAR with TRAF1 and TRAF3 by yeast two-hybrid interaction assays. No interaction of ATAR with TRAF1 or TRAF3 was detected in this assay (Fig. 3 A). Because human and mouse ATAR are poorly conserved within their intracellular domains, we tested the ability of mouse ATAR to interact with TRAF proteins. Like its human homolog, mouse ATAR interacted with TRAF2 and TRAF5 but not TRAF1 or TRAF3 (Fig. 3 A). Sequence alignment revealed a stretch of nine conserved amino acids (residues 261–269 in mouse and 264–272 in human) among otherwise largely unrelated intracellular domains (Fig. 1 A), suggesting the importance of this short conserved region in TRAF recognition. To further localize the TRAF-interacting region, we fused residues 224–263 or residues 264–283 of the human ATAR intracellular domain to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and tested their interaction with TRAF proteins. The GAL4DB-ATAR(264–283) fusion protein containing the conserved nine-amino acid stretch was able to bind both TRAF5 and TRAF2. Therefore, the C-terminal 20 amino acids of ATAR were sufficient for TRAF interaction. Interestingly, the last four of these nine amino acids are conserved in the TRAF-interacting region of CD40 (Fig.3 B). Double mutations of CD40 Glu253 and Thr254 to alanine abolished the TRAF interaction (21Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes & Development. 1996; 10: 963-973Google Scholar). Each of the four conserved amino acids of ATAR was substituted with alanine, and each point mutant was tested for its interaction with TRAF2 and TRAF5 (Fig. 3 B). The glutamic acid to alanine substitution at position 271 abolished ATAR interaction with the TRAF proteins. However, the other point mutants interacted as well as the wild type receptor with TRAF2 and TRAF5. We then examined the interaction of ATAR with TRAF proteins in mammalian cells. An expression vector that directs the synthesis of full-length ATAR was co-transfected with a FLAG-tagged TRAF2 or TRAF5 expression vector into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Cell lysates from each transfection were immunoprecipitated with either preimmune serum or a polyclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of ATAR. Western analysis of the immunoprecipitates were performed with a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope. Both Flag-TRAF2 and Flag-TRAF5 specifically co-precipitated with ATAR (Fig.4). Therefore ATAR is another TRAF-interacting TNFR family member. Interaction of ATAR with TRAF2 and TRAF5 suggests that like TNFR2 and CD40, ATAR may also mediate NF-κB activation. To test this possibility, a NF-κB-dependent reporter construct was transfected into 293 cells. Co-transfection with a ATAR expression vector resulted in an approximately 10-fold induction of luciferase activity as compared with the vector transfection control (Fig.5 A). This NF-κB activation requires ATAR interaction with TRAF proteins, because expression of ATAR(E271A), the point mutant that no longer interacts with TRAF2 or TRAF5, failed to activate NF-κB (Fig. 5 A). Both TRAF2 and TRAF5, when overexpressed, activate NF-κB. This activity depends on their N-terminal RING finger and zinc finger motifs (11Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F.

We generated a TRAF5(205–558) truncation mutant lacking the RING and zinc finger motifs. In a dose-dependent experiment, co-expression of TRAF5(205–558) deletion mutant with ATAR in 293 cells blocks NF-κB activation induced by ATAR overexpression (Fig. 5 B). Similar inhibitory effects were observed when ATAR was co-expressed with TRAF2 RING and zinc finger deletion mutant (data not shown). These dominant negative inhibitory effects suggest potential involvement of both TRAF5 and TRAF2 in ATAR-mediated NF-κB activation pathway.

When co-expressed with TRAF5 or TRAF2, ATAR(E271A) did not affect NF-κB activation induced by TRAF5 or TRAF2 (data not shown). This specific synergistic activation by ATAR and TRAF5 suggests that TRAF5 plays a unique role in ATAR signaling. DISCUSSIONWe report here the identification of a novel TNFR family member. ATAR is the smallest reported member of this receptor superfamily so far. The human and mouse homologs are poorly conserved (45% identity) as compared with other members within the family. For example, TNFR1, TNFR2, Fas, and CD40 share 65, 64, 51, and 63% identity in the two species, respectively. This poor sequence conservation is especially evident in the region of the short cytoplasmic tail (25% identity). However, we argued against the possibility that they may represent distinct receptors based on two factors: 1) no other human counterparts were isolated during cDNA library screening with mouse ATAR, and 2) distinct receptors within this family share approximately 25% between each other.Despite the limited homology, both human and mouse ATAR intracellular domains interact with the same TRAF proteins. This TRAF-binding activity resides in the C-terminal 20 amino acids of human ATAR, because GAL4-ATAR(264–283) is still able to interact with TRAF5. Interestingly, within this region is a stretch of nine amino acids well aligned with the corresponding region in the mouse receptor. Similar amino acid residues have been shown to be crucial in TRAF-recognition by TNFR2, CD40, and CD30. This finding should help shed light on the structural requirements of TRAF-receptor interactions.Overexpression of ATAR in mammalian cells results in NF-κB activation. This activation depends on the interaction of ATAR with TRAF proteins, because a TRAF-binding deficient mutant (E271A) fails to activate NF-κB. In addition, we found that co-expression of ATAR with TRAF5 but not TRAF2 resulted in synergistic activation of NF-κB. These results suggest that TRAF5 contributes to ATAR-mediated NF-κB activation. However, it does not rule out involvement of TRAF2 in this process, because TRAF2 is ubiquitously expressed and might not be a limiting factor in 293 cells.ATAR is identical to a recently reported protein (HVEM) that was identified as a receptor for mediating viral entry of herpes simplex virus-1 and -2 (22Montgomer R.I. Warner M.S. Lum B.J. Spear P.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine if this viral entry process activates ATAR and how cellular responses mediated by the receptor (e.g. NF-κB activation) affect the viral life cycle. It is noteworthy that latent infection membrane protein-1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus also interacts with TRAF proteins through its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Possible pathogenic roles of ATAR and TRAF proteins in herpes simplex virus infection await further study.ATAR is mainly expressed in spleen, thymus, bone marrow, and small intestine, all tissues in which lymphoid cells are enriched. This expression pattern suggests that ATAR plays a role in development or regulation of the immune system. This notion is supported by the fact that ATAR mediates activation of NF-κB, which in turn activates a battery of genes crucial to immune regulation (23Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar). Among the known TNF-like ligands tested, we did not detect interaction of ATAR with TNFα, lymphotoxin α and β, or CD40 ligand (data not shown). Identification of its cognate ligand will greatly improve our understanding of the physiological role of ATAR. We report here the identification of a novel TNFR family member.

https://openalex.org/W2043343878,"Head and neck carcinogenesis is believed to be a multistep process, whereby genetic events accumulate in the carcinogen-exposed field at risk, resulting in distinct phenotypic premalignant changes that eventually evolve into invasive cancer. Frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the chromosome 9p21 region and inactivation of p16INK4a by different mechanisms have been described in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Recently, we reported that loss of 9p21 is also frequent in oral premalignant lesions. To investigate potential inactivation of p16INK4a in these premalignant lesions, we analysed 74 biopsies from 36 patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for expression of the p16 protein. Loss of p16 expression was found in 28 (38%) of the lesion biopsies from 17 patients (47%). LOH at the D9s171, a marker in the 9p21 region, was observed in 19 lesion biopsies from 12 cases and correlated with absence of p16 by IHC in 11 (92%) of the 12 comparable cases and 15 (79%) of 19 lesion biopsies. By direct sequencing of ten lesion biopsies from ten individuals with LOH at D9s171 for p16INK4a exon 2, one non-sense mutation at codon 88 (GGA→TGA) was identified. Our data suggest that inactivation of p16INK4a may play an important role in early head and neck cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2036568037,"Cysteine proteases of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme family have been implicated in the effector process of apoptosis in several systems. Among these, CPP32 has been shown to be processed to active enzyme at the onset of apoptosis. Here, we show that CPP32 precursor is cleaved into its active form during phytohaemaglutinin A activation of T lymphocytes. Maximal processing is observed between day 3 and day 4 following addition of mitogen and is a transient process. Precursor cleavage is associated with the appearance of a CPP32-like enzymatic activity in cell lysates. At this time in the culture, almost no apoptotic cell and no dead cell can be detected, and T lymphocytes are actively proliferating. CPP32 processing also occurs when lymphocytes are stimulated through an allogeneic primary mixed lymphocyte reaction. Our results suggest that proteolytic activation of CPP32 could be a physiological step during T lymphocyte activation. In addition, these data indicate that CPP32 activation can occur independently of programmed cell death in T lymphocytes."

Excystation is blocked by specific cysteine protease inhibitors. Using a biotinylated inhibitor, the target protease was identified and its corresponding gene cloned. The protease was localized to vesicles that release their contents just prior to excystation. The Giardia protease is the earliest known branch of the cathepsin B family. Its phylogeny confirms that the cathepsin B lineage evolved in primitive eukaryotic cells, prior to the divergence of plant and animal kingdoms, and underscores the diversity of cellular functions that this enzyme family facilitates."

https://openalex.org/W2015532531,"The 92 kd type IV collagenase/gelatinase (MMP-9) is important in mediating basement membrane and extracellular matrix degradation in metastasis. Because MMP-9 is made in tumor cells, but not in quiescent normal cells, we wished to identify the transcriptional elements responsible for its synthesis in tumor cells. We chose to characterize transcriptional regulation of the MMP-9 gene in a highly metastatic H-ras and v-myc transformed rat embryo cell line which overexpresses MMP-9. Using transient transfection of reporter gene constructs containing either 5′-deleted or mutated MMP-9 promoter fragments, as well as electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we have demonstrated that multiple transcription factor consensus binding motifs in the promoter, including those for NFκB, SP-1, Ets, AP-1, and a retinoblastoma binding element, participate in transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 expression in this cell line. Also, deletion of an alternating purine-pyrimidine tract in the downstream promoter was found to decrease transcriptional activity, suggesting that promoter conformation may be important in MMP-9 regulation. Thus multiple pathways leading to activation of NFκB, SP-1, Ets, AP-1, and retinoblastoma binding factors in tumor cells all may contribute to MMP-9 transcription and hence to metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2313211164,"We previously described in the CCL39 hamster fibroblast cell line the inhibition of DNA synthesis reinitiation by agents that elevate cyclic AMP. Here, we show that 8Br-cAMP strongly blocks both the growth factor-induced increase in cyclin D1 protein expression and decrease in p27KIP1 protein levels, leaving untouched the levels of cyclin D3, cdk2 and cdk4. To assess the role of cyclin D1 in the cAMP-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis, we overexpressed the cyclin D1 gene in CCL39 and analysed the cAMP response in stable transfectants. We showed that the kinase activities associated to G1 cyclin-cdk complexes are significantly more resistant to cAMP in cyclin D1 transfectants than in their normal counterparts, although the serum-induced p27KIP1 disparition is still cAMP sensitive in cyclin D1 overexpressors. Interestingly, the mitogen-induced DNA synthesis reinitiation is also much less inhibited by cAMP in cyclin D1 transfectants than in control cells. These data clearly establish that the cAMP-inducible blockade of the G1 phase of the cell cycle can be partially alleviated by overexpression of cyclin D1 in hamster fibroblasts, thus strongly suggesting that cyclin D1 protein is one of the major targets for cAMP inhibitory action in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2040064188,"Peroxisome proliferators (PPs) are a class of nongenotoxic carcinogens in the rodent liver. The induction of immediate-early gene expression in immortalized mouse liver cells by the PPs Wy-14,643, monoethylhexyl phthalate, ciprofibrate ethyl ester, and clofibrate suggested that they may be activating growth-regulatory signal transduction pathways. We report that incubation of quiescent ML457 cells with Wy-14,643 resulted in the appearance of two tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of approximately 44 and 42 kDa with maximal phosphorylation at 20 min. These two proteins were identified as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) ERK1 and ERK2 (also known as mitogen-activated protein kinases, or MAPKs). Stimulation of quiescent ML457 cells with monoethylhexyl phthalate, ciprofibrate ethyl ester, and clofibrate also resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2; however, the steroid PP dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, which does not induce immediate-early gene expression, did not induce phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. Kinase activity of ERK1 and ERK2 was stimulated by the PPs, consistent with their phosphorylation. The PPs also induced phosphorylation of the upstream regulator MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK). Preincubation of quiescent cells with MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked activation of ERK1 and ERK2 by the PPs, implicating MEK activation as a requirement for PP-induced ERK activation.

In rodents, PPs are nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogens (1Ashby J Brady A Elcombe C.R Elliot B.M. Ishmael J Odum J Tugwood J. D Kettle S Purchase I.F.H. et al.Hum. Exp.

Evidence suggests that PPs possess growth-modulatory activities that are independent of peroxisome proliferation (2Marsman D.S. Cattley R.C. Conway J.G. Popp J.A.

Indeed, PP-induced hepatocarcinogenesis is greater in older rats where a higher rate of spontaneously initiated cells would be expected (8Grasl-Kraupp B. Huber W. Taper H. Schulte-Hermann R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 666-671PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cattley R.C. Marsman D.S. Popp J.A. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although the PPs are structurally diverse, most are amphipathic molecules containing a large hydrophobic (aliphatic or aromatic) moiety as well as a carboxylic acid or an ester that can be converted into an acid (10Lake B.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 483-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of this group include hypolipidemic agents that are fibric acid derivatives, such as ciprofibrate and clofibrate, Wy-14,643 (a non-fibrate hypolipidemic agent), MEHP (the active metabolite of the plasticizer diethylhexyl phthalate), and DHEA, an adrenal steroid. As amphipathic carboxylic acids, PPs are similar in structure to a group of important cell signaling molecules, the fatty acids. An early event in signal transduction induced by growth factors and other agonists is the liberation of fatty acids from membrane phospholipids. Free fatty acids act as second messengers by rapid and transient changes in their concentrations in response to receptor activation (11Graber R. Sumida C. Nunez E.A. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1994; 9: 91-116PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, they act as modulators of signaling molecules such as phospholipases, kinases, and G-proteins (12Sumida C. Graber R. Nunez E.A. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1993; 48: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Activation of signaling pathways by the fatty acids results in gene expression and subsequent modulation of cell growth. Activation of signal transduction pathways has become a common theme among a variety of nongenotoxic tumor promoters. Examples include the activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters (13Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5758) Google Scholar), activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family by Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (14Chao T.O. Byron K.L. Lee K. Villereal M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19876-19883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (15Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and activation of the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by palytoxin (16Kuroki D.W. Bignami G.S. Wattenberg E.V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar). Since PPs behave as tumor promoters and are similar in structure to fatty acids, they may function by modulating growth-regulatory signaling pathways. In addition, some PPs have been shown to induce the expression of immediate-early genes, including c-fos, c-jun, junB, and egr-1, and to modulate cell proliferation in mouse liver cell lines (17Ledwith B.J. Johnson T.E. Wagner L.K. Pauley C.J. Manam S. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3257-3264PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ledwith B.J. Manam S. Troilo P. Joslyn D.J. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 8: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that several of the PPs activate the MAPK family members ERK1 and ERK2 in an immortalized mouse liver cell line. The activation of ERK1 and ERK2 appears to be important to the induction of immediate-early gene expression by the PPs. Wy-14,643 was purchased from ChemSyn Science Laboratories (Lenexa, KS).

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Before stimulation, confluent cultures were serum-starved by incubation in 0.1% serum-containing medium for 3 days. The quiescent cells were then subjected to the various compounds diluted in media containing 0.1% serum and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.1. In experiments using the inhibitor PD98059, cells were incubated with the inhibitor for 1 h before stimulation. Hepatocytes were isolated from Harlan Sprague Dawley rats by standard two-stage perfusion and incubated overnight in serum-free William's Medium E before treatment. Stock solutions of PPs and PD98059 were dissolved in Me2SO. Upon dilution of stocks in culture media, Me2SO concentrations were 0.2% or lower. After stimulation, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5). Lysates (50 μg) were separated by 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. For anti-phosphotyrosine blotting, membranes were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and then incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of monoclonal antibodies PY20 and G410 in block for 1 h. Identification of ERK1 and ERK2 was accomplished using a 1:2000 dilution of polyclonal anti-ERK1 antibody plus polyclonal anti-ERK2 antibody in 5% nonfat milk in TBST. Phospho-specific ERK (MAPK) and MEK1/2 antibodies were used as specified by the manufacturer. Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Treated cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate in phosphate-buffered saline). Lysates containing 100 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated by incubation with polyclonal anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 antibodies (5 μl of each antibody) for 1 h followed by a second hour with protein A-agarose. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with RIPA buffer and three times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA). Immunocomplexes were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μmATP, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein. Reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer, and 10 μl of each sample was subjected to 10–18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then visualized by autoradiography. After stimulation, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was isolated by guanidinium isothiocyanate lysis as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). Total RNA was quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm, and 10 μg of each sample was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel. Equal loading of RNA was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining. RNA was transferred to nylon-supported nitrocellulose by capillary blotting, and blots were hybridized overnight with 32P nick-translated DNA (5 × 105 cpm/ml) in 50% formamide, 1 m NaCl, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 10% dextran sulfate. Blots were washed in 0.1 × SSC (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), 0.5% SDS at 37 °C and then exposed to Kodak Biomax film. To determine if the PPs activated a tyrosine kinase cascade, quiescent ML457 cells were treated with 1 mm Wy-14,643 for various lengths of time. This concentration causes optimal induction of immediate-early gene expression while avoiding toxicity (17Ledwith B.J. Johnson T.E. Wagner L.K. Pauley C.J. Manam S. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3257-3264PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ledwith B.J. Manam S. Troilo P. Joslyn D.J. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 8: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Western blotting of whole cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed a transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins in response to Wy-14,643 (Fig. 1). The two proteins were approximately 44 and 42 kDa in size and were maximally phosphorylated at 20 min. A low level of phosphorylation in control cells (refed with no addition) was seen at 0 and 10 min but disappeared by 20 min, possibly due to the removal of extracellular factors by the media change. Interestingly, these proteins were the same size as the downstream regulators of the Ras pathway, ERK1 and ERK2. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with anti-ERK antibodies confirmed the identity of p42 and p44 as ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig.2, see below).Figure 2Other PPs induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. Quiescent ML457 cells were treated with no addition (NA), 1 mm Wy-14,643, 1 mm MEHP, 1 mm ciprofibrate ethyl ester, 1 mm clofibrate, 1 mm DHEA-S, or 20% serum for 20 min before SDS lysis (panels A and B) or RIPA lysis (panel C). A, tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 were detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies as described in Fig. 1.B, tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 were detected in whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific ERK antibody. C, ERK1 and ERK2 were immunoprecipitated from RIPA lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures.”αPTyr, αTyr(P). In the top panel, tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK1 and -2 were detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The bottom panel shows the same blot stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To see if phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 could be found with other PPs, quiescent ML457 cells were treated with 1 mmconcentrations of MEHP, ciprofibrate ethyl ester, clofibrate, and DHEA-S. The 20-min time point for each PP is shown in three separate experiments in Fig. 2. ERK tyrosine phosphorylation was examined by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 2 A) and anti-phospho ERK (Fig. 2 B) antibodies or by immunoprecipitation of ERK proteins followed by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting (Fig. 2 C). Consistent with its strong induction of immediate-early gene expression (17Ledwith B.J. Johnson T.E. Wagner L.K. Pauley C.J. Manam S. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3257-3264PubMed Google Scholar), MEHP caused a marked increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 as compared with no addition (Fig. 2,A–C). Two other inducers of immediate-early gene expression, ciprofibrate ethyl ester and clofibrate, also caused a phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. However, the extent of ERK phosphorylation induced by ciprofibrate ethyl ester and clofibrate varied during experiments and is probably due to the oily nature of the compounds, resulting in variable solubilities at the time of treatment. DHEA-S is the more soluble and active metabolite of DHEA, a naturally secreted adrenal steroid (20Yamada J. Sakuma M. Ikeda T. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Unlike the other PPs, DHEA-S does not resemble a fatty acid, does not cause a transient increase in liver cell proliferation in vivo (21Rao M.S. Subbarao V. Yeldandi A.V. Reddy J.K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2977-2979PubMed Google Scholar), and does not induce immediate-early gene expression (17Ledwith B.J. Johnson T.E. Wagner L.K. Pauley C.J. Manam S. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3257-3264PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, DHEA-S did not induce phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig.2,A–C). To determine if the tyrosine phosphorylation of the ERKs resulted in induction of their kinase activity, ERK1 and ERK2 were immunoprecipitated from quiescent ML457 cells stimulated with increasing doses of the PPs and used in an immunocomplex kinase assay. ERK activation by the PPs was consistent with the results seen for tyrosine phosphorylation. The 1 mm concentrations of Wy-14,643, MEHP, ciprofibrate ethyl ester, and clofibrate all increased ERK activation over control levels (no addition), whereas DHEA-S did not increase ERK activity. In addition, increasing ERK activity could be seen with increasing doses of each of the PPs with the exception of DHEA-S (Fig. 3). ERK activity continued to increase with PP doses of up to 2 mm; however, cytotoxicity was apparent above 1 mm (data not shown). In response to growth factors and other agonists, receptor tyrosine kinases initiate a signaling cascade leading to Ras activation followed by a sequential activation of Raf and MEK (22Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3207) Google Scholar). MEK is a dual-specific kinase that phosphorylates ERK1 and ERK2, leading to their activation (23Nakielny S. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MEK is also activated by phosphorylation. To determine if the PPs activated MEK, quiescent ML457 cells were stimulated with 1 mm concentrations of the PPs or with 20% serum. Western blotting using a phospho-specific MEK antibody showed that MEK was phosphorylated in response to PP stimulation (Fig.4). Phosphorylation by activated MEK is the main pathway of ERK activation although other mechanisms of ERK activation have been demonstrated (24Ettehadieh E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Hess-Bienz D. Watts J. Shastri N. Aebersold R. Science. 1992; 255: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,25Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3449-3454PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if ERK activation by the PPs is mainly through their activation of MEK, a specific inhibitor of MEK, PD98059, was employed (26Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). PD98059 prevents the activation of MEK by upstream regulators (27Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Incubation of quiescent ML457 cells with PD98059 before stimulation with the PPs greatly reduced both the tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown) and kinase activity of the ERKs (Fig.5). A dose of 10 μm PD98059 reduced the levels of ERK activation by the PPs to approximately that of no addition, confirming a role for MEK in PP-induced ERK activation. Activation of the ERKs leads to the phosphorylation of a variety of substrates including transcription factors (28Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 29Seth A. Alvarez E. Gupta S. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23521-23524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that ultimately regulate gene expression. Induction of immediate-early gene expression by the PPs has been shown previously (17Ledwith B.J. Johnson T.E. Wagner L.K. Pauley C.J. Manam S. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3257-3264PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ledwith B.J. Manam S. Troilo P. Joslyn D.J. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 8: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine if activation of ERK1 and ERK2 by the PPs is responsible for their induction of immediate-early gene expression, quiescent cells were preincubated with PD98059 followed by PP stimulation and RNA isolation. The evaluation of three immediate-early genes, c-fos,egr-1, and junB, is shown in Fig.6. As seen previously (17Ledwith B.J. Johnson T.E. Wagner L.K. Pauley C.J. Manam S. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3257-3264PubMed Google Scholar), the expression of c-fos, egr-1, and junB mRNA was induced by 1 mm concentrations of Wy-14,643, MEHP, ciprofibrate ethyl ester, and clofibrate. In the presence of PD98059, a marked reduction in PP-induced gene expression was observed. Expression of c-fos and egr-1 were most strongly affected, showing a dose-dependent decrease with PD98059 for all PPs. Induction of junB and c-jun (data not shown) expression was generally less inhibited, particularly for MEHP. While Wy-14,643-induced junB expression was significantly reduced at 5 μm PD98059, the reduction at 10 μmPD98059 was less, suggesting an inhibitor-based modulation. Since no effect on gene expression was seen with the inhibitor alone, perhaps blocking the signaling cascade at MEK augments alternative pathways. To ensure that our results were not specific to this in vitro system, immediate-early gene expression and ERK phosphorylation were examined in primary rat hepatocytes. Induction of immediate-early gene expression by the PPs has been shown in other liver and non-liver cell lines (17Ledwith B.J. Johnson T.E. Wagner L.K. Pauley C.J. Manam S. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3257-3264PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ledwith B.J. Manam S. Troilo P. Joslyn D.J. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 8: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were treated with 100 μm or 1 mm Wy-14,643 for 20 min for protein isolation or for 1–24 h for RNA isolation. Western blotting using a phospho-specific ERK antibody showed an increase in ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation upon treatment with 1 mm Wy-14,643 (Fig. 7 A), whereas induction of immediate-early gene expression was seen after a 1-h treatment with 1 mm Wy-14,643 (junB is shown in Fig.7 B), consistent with the results seen in ML457 cells. Although a side-by-side comparison is not shown, the induction of both ERK phosphorylation and immediate-early gene expression was lower in hepatocytes than in ML457 cells. In addition to junB expression, the expression of two genes involved in peroxisome proliferation, FACO and CYP4A1, are shown (Fig.7 B). Both FACO and CYP4A1 are induced by treatment with 100 μm Wy-14,643 but not by the 1 mm dose of Wy-14,643. Conversely, junB expression was induced at 1 mm but not 100 μm Wy-14,643. This is consistent with the fact that peroxisome proliferation is induced at lower doses of PPs (2Marsman D.S. Cattley R.C. Conway J.G. Popp J.A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6739-6744PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wada N. Marsman D.S. Popp J.A. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1992; 18: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) while immediate-early gene expressionin vitro (17Ledwith B.J. Johnson T.E. Wagner L.K. Pauley C.J. Manam S. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3257-3264PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ledwith B.J. Manam S. Troilo P. Joslyn D.J. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 8: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and cell proliferation in vivo(2Marsman D.S. Cattley R.C. Conway J.G. Popp J.A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6739-6744PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wada N. Marsman D.S. Popp J.A. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1992; 18: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) require higher doses. We have shown that the PPs Wy-14,643, MEHP, ciprofibrate ethyl ester, and clofibrate transiently activate the MAPK family members ERK1 and ERK2 in the immortalized mouse liver cell line ML457. The steroid PP DHEA-S did not activate the ERKs, which is consistent with its inability to induce immediate-early gene expression (17Ledwith B.J. Johnson T.E. Wagner L.K. Pauley C.J. Manam S. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3257-3264PubMed Google Scholar). These compounds had minimal effects on the activation of the MAPK family members JNK and p38 (data not shown). All of the PPs tested (except DHEA-S) produced a dose-dependent increase in ERK phosphorylation between 100 μm and 2 mmconcentrations. The 1 mm dose induced strong levels of ERK activation for each of the PPs without significant toxicity. Although a 1 mm dose is much higher than needed for induction of peroxisomal enzymes, it is consistent with the doses necessary for optimal immediate-early gene induction and regulation of cell cycle progression (17Ledwith B.J. Johnson T.E. Wagner L.K. Pauley C.J. Manam S. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3257-3264PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that regulation of cell growth by PPs may be independent of peroxisome proliferation, can require higher doses, and may be more relevant to hepatocarcinogenesis (2Marsman D.S. Cattley R.C. Conway J.G. Popp J.A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6739-6744PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wada N. Marsman D.S. Popp J.A. Fundam. Appl.

Health Perspect. 1993; 101 (Suppl. 5): 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In vivo, the plasma levels of both ciprofibrate and clofibrate are in the range necessary for ERK activation in vitro. Continually feeding rats approximately 12.5 mg of ciprofibrate/kg of body weight resulted in 100% tumor incidence (1Ashby J Brady A Elcombe C.R Elliot B.M. Ishmael J Odum J Tugwood J. D Kettle S Purchase I.F.H. et al.Hum. Exp. Toxicol... 1994; 13 (Suppl. 2,): S1-S117Google Scholar) while rats gavaged with 10 mg of ciprofibrate/kg daily for 1 week gave average drug plasma levels of 0.5–0.6 mm(33Eason C.T. Powles P. Henry G. Spencer A.J Pattison A. Bonner F.W. Xenobiotica. 1989; 19: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Since ciprofibrate accumulates in the liver (34Waddell W.J. Marlowe C. Sambasiva Rao M. Reddy J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the liver concentration of ciprofibrate is likely to be higher than plasma levels. Studies with clofibrate have shown a 90% tumor incidence when rats were continually fed approximately 250 mg/kg (1Ashby J Brady A Elcombe C.R Elliot B.M. Ishmael J Odum J Tugwood J. D Kettle S Purchase I.F.H. et al.Hum. Exp. Toxicol... 1994; 13 (Suppl. 2,): S1-S117Google Scholar). Plasma drug levels after daily doses of clofibrate for 1 week were at a mean of 0.37–0.47 mm in rats fed 250–300 mg/kg and peaked at 1.4 mm in rats gavaged with 125 mg/kg (35Cayen M.N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 29: 157-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MEK, the upstream regulator of the ERKs, is also activated by the PPs as shown by the induction of MEK phosphorylation following PP treatment. Inhibition of MEK activity by the MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059 greatly reduced the induction of ERK activity by the PPs. This reduction of ERK activity by PD98059 was utilized to assess the role of ERK activation in the induction of immediate-early gene expression by the PPs. Although the results varied depending on the specific gene and PP evaluated, a small to significant reduction of PP-induced gene expression was generally observed in the presence of PD98059. Since PD98059 did not block all PP-induced gene expression, other signaling pathways may be modulated by some of the PPs. However, the induction of immediate-early gene expression by the PPs can be largely attributed to the activation of ERK1 and ERK2. Induction of ERK phosphorylation was also seen in primary rat hepatocytes treated with 1 mm Wy-14,643. The level of ERK phosphorylation in hepatocytes was lower than seen in ML457 cells; however, ML457 cells contain higher levels of ERK protein (data not shown), accounting for some of this discrepancy. It is not surprising that differentiated hepatocytes would respond less strongly to mitogen-activated signaling pathways than an immortalized cell line. The preneoplastic liver cells promoted by PPs in vivo are probably more similar to the growth-competent immortalized liver cells than to mature differentiated hepatocytes. Consistent with the induction of ERK phosphorylation, an induction ofjunB expression is seen in hepatocytes after a 1-h treatment with 1 mm Wy-14,643. The 100 μm dose of Wy-14,643 had no effect on junB expression but did induce the expression of two genes involved in peroxisome proliferation,FACO and CYP4A1. However, FACO andCYP4A1 expression were not seen with the 1 mmdose of Wy-14,643. This is consistent with the idea that the induction of peroxisome proliferation occurs at low doses of PPs whereas induction of immediate-early gene expression and cell proliferation requires higher doses. This inverse relationship may suggest an antagonism between induction of peroxisome proliferation and activation of immediate-early signaling pathways. The induction of peroxisome proliferation in differentiated hepatocytes is mediated by the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) (36Lee S.S.-T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar, 37Green S. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The PPARs (α, γ, δ) are members of the steroid receptor superfamily and function as transcription factors. PPARα is transcriptionally activated by the PPs, fatty acids, and other ligands (37Green S. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 38Issemann I. Prince R.A. Tugwood J.D. Green S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 11: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The antagonism between peroxisome proliferation and immediate-early gene expression discussed above may be due to interaction between growth-regulatory signaling pathways and PPARα. For example, many nuclear receptors including PPARα (39Sakai M. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Nishizawa M. Nishi S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5370-5376PubMed Google Scholar) are mutually antagonistic with the transcription factor AP-1 (fos-jun heterodimer), apparently via competition for common cofactors such as CREB-binding protein (40Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfield M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). Interestingly, preneoplastic foci and tumors promoted by PPs often have reduced peroxisomal gene expression relative to the surrounding normal hepatocytes (41Yokoyama Y. Tsuchida S. Hatayama I. Satoh K. Narita T. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Yamada J. Suga T. Sato K. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), possibly due to increased AP-1 activity and hence decreased PPARα activity within the proliferating cells. A role for PPARα in PP-induced hepatocarcinogenesis is hypothesized but unconfirmed, yet PPAR-independent mechanisms could be responsible for, or at least contribute to, PP-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Activation of the ERK signaling pathway leading to enhanced cell proliferation is one potential mechanism. Alternatively, activation of the ERKs may contribute to PP-induced hepatocarcinogenesis by modulating PPARα activity. Recently, studies have shown that the ERKs phosphorylate PPARγ in response to insulin, epidermal growth factor, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and that this phosphorylation affects PPARγ transcriptional activity (42Zhang B. Berger J. Zhou G. Elbrecht A. Biswas S. White-Carrington S. Szalkowski D. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31771-31774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 43Hu E.

Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Similar interaction between the ERKs and PPARα are likely since insulin stimulates PPARα phosphorylation in rat adipocytes (44Shalev A. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Yen P.M. Wahli W. Burger A.G. Chin W.W. Meier C.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4499-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate enhances fatty acid-induced PPARα transcriptional activity in rat hepatoma cells (45Jindal A. Appel R.A. Ribiero R.C.J. Bass N.M. Hepatology. 1996; 24 (abstr.): 359Google Scholar). However, the potential cross-talk between ERK and PPARα may have synergistic or antagonistic characteristics and does not exclude a contribution of ERK alone to hepatocarcinogenesis. ERK activation by the PPs is independent of PPARα since ML457 cells do not undergo peroxisome proliferation nor contain detectable levels of PPARα. 3B. J. Ledwith, unpublished results. Activation of the ERKs by the PPs could have profound effects on cell proliferation and may be an integral part of their tumor-promoting capabilities. Tumor promotion involves selective effects on the growth of preneoplastic cells over the surrounding normal tissue. These preneoplastic cells could preferentially respond to the activation of the ERK signaling pathway that plays an important role in growth regulation. A role for ERK in tumor promotion is supported by one study which showed that constitutively active mutants of MEK1 in fibroblasts cause an elevated basal level of ERK activity leading to a reduced growth factor requirement for DNA synthesis and rapid tumor formation in nude mice (46Brunet A. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate study, a correlation was seen between tumor growth rate and the degree of ERK activation in NIH 3T3 cell clones overexpressing insulin receptor substrate 1 (47Ito T. Sasaki Y. Wands J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Further support is provided by the activity of the skin tumor promoter BHTOOH. Activation of ERK2 by BHTOOH and its metabolites in cultured keratinocytes correlated with their tumor-promoting activities in vivo. In addition, BHTOOH-induced ERK2 activation provided some protection from the cytotoxicity induced by the BHTOOH metabolites (48Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Kensler T.W. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3480-3485PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, activation of ERK2 in initiated cells could provide a selective growth advantage along with a protective effect against toxicity, whereas the inhibitory effects of toxicity on non-initiated cells could provide further selective pressure (48Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Kensler T.W. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3480-3485PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the PPs have inhibitory effects on cell growth (17Ledwith B.J. Johnson T.E. Wagner L.K. Pauley C.J. Manam S. Galloway S.M. Nichols W.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3257-3264PubMed Google Scholar, 32Chen Z.Y. Liu Y.F. He C.Y. White C.C. Eaton D.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2622-2629PubMed Google Scholar) in addition to their induction of ERK activity, both of which may contribute to their tumor-promoting activity. In summary, we have shown that the PPs Wy-14,643, MEHP, ciprofibrate ethyl ester, and clofibrate stimulate ERK1 and ERK2 activity in a MEK-dependent manner and that this activity is necessary for the complete induction of immediate-early genes by the PPs in ML457 cells. In addition, induction of ERK phosphorylation by Wy-14,643 was evident in primary rat hepatocytes. The mechanism by which the PPs are activating the ERK/MEK pathway is currently under investigation. These results place the PPs in the growing class of tumor promoters that modulate growth-regulatory pathways in the cell. We thank Gary Dysart and John DeLuca for preparing the rat hepatocytes. We also thank John Balliet and Sujata Manam for critical reading of the manuscript and helpful discussions."

https://openalex.org/W2402625550,"A significant proportion of human cancers express high levels of p53 protein in the absence of an underlying mutation in the gene. Using transformed (Vh1) and non-transformed (FRTL-5) rat thyroid epithelial cell lines as a model, we have examined the mechanisms by which high levels of wild-type p53 may be tolerated. Stable transfection with p53-dependent reporter constructs demonstrated that the 'excess' wild-type p53 in Vh1 cells is not associated with a comparable increase in p53-dependent transcription (though the response to u.v. irradiation is retained). Mdm-2, which binds p53 and inhibits its transactivation activity, is overexpressed in Vh1 cells in the absence of gene amplification and in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore disruption of p53-mdm-2 complex formation in Vh1 cells by microinjection of an antibody to the p53-binding domain of mdm-2 resulted in a dramatic increase in p53-dependent transcription. Since only a small proportion of the p53 in Vh1 cells was found to be in complex with mdm-2 (the majority of unbound protein being in a latent form), this suggests that mdm-2 selectively binds a pool of p53 that would otherwise be active as a sequence-specific activator of transcription. We suggest that, in some types of tumour, the 'sensitivity' of the p53-driven mdm-2 feedback loop may be sufficient to prevent free, active p53 reaching the level required for growth arrest or apoptosis, making them an ideal target for therapies designed to disrupt p53-mdm-2 interactions."

Evidence suggests that many of these effects are the results of PGE2 interacting with specific seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Based upon their ligand binding selectivity and signaling pathway activation, these receptor subtypes are classified as EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 (1Breyer M.D. Jacobson H.R. Breyer R.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 8-17Google Scholar, 2Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229Google Scholar). Extensive structural information is available for GPCRs that bind small ligands (biogenic amine neurotransmitters, nucleotides, and opsin), and such studies have provided significant insights regarding the receptor amino acid residues required for ligand recognition (for review, see Ref. 3Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Google Scholar). Evidence supports the role of residues embedded in the transmembrane as important in receptor-ligand interactions (4van Rhee A.M. Jacobson K.A. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 37: 1-38Google Scholar). In contrast, the extracellular regions appear to be relatively unimportant for binding of these small ligands, with the exception of a role of an extracellular cysteine disulfide bridge demonstrated in several receptors including the β-adrenergic receptor (5Fraser C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9266-9270Google Scholar) and the thromboxane A2 receptor (6D'Angelo D.D. Eubank J.J. Davis M.G. Dorn III, G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6233-6240Google Scholar) as well as a portion of the second extracellular loop of the adenosine A1 and A2areceptors (7Kim J. Jiang Q. Glashofer M. Yehle S. Wess J. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 683-691Google Scholar, 8Olah M.E. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24692-24698Google Scholar). Less is known regarding the structural determinants of EP receptor-ligand interactions. Several groups have previously identified the importance of an arginine residue found in transmembrane region VII of the EP3 receptor and conserved throughout prostanoid receptors (9Audoly L. Breyer R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 57: 61-68Google Scholar, 10Negishi M. Irie A. Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16122-16127Google Scholar, 11Huang C. Tai H.-H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 493-498Google Scholar). Substitution of Arg329 in transmembrane VII to either Ala or Glu led to a loss of detectable [3H]PGE2 binding and receptor-mediated inhibition of [cAMP]i (9Audoly L. Breyer R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 57: 61-68Google Scholar). Comparisons of the amino acid sequence between the rabbit EP3 receptor and the other cloned prostanoid receptors have identified several regions of conservation (9Audoly L. Breyer R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 57: 61-68Google Scholar). Fourteen conserved amino acid residues were identified outside the putative transmembrane regions, including six amino acid residues clustered in the amino-terminal portion of the second extracellular loop. We hypothesized that conserved extracellular regions of the EP3 receptor affect receptor/ligand interactions either directly or indirectly, analogous to the proposed interactions between the extracellular regions and ligands of peptide-binding GPCRs such as neurokinin-1 (13Fong T.M. Yu H. Huang R.-R.C. Strader C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11806-11811Google Scholar), thyrotropin (14Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Russo D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2176-2182Google Scholar). To test whether this conserved primary structure plays a role in receptor-ligand interaction, a series of point mutants were generated and assayed for their ability to bind a panel of natural and synthetic prostanoid analogs. Findings presented herein provide evidence that the second extracellular loop of the prostaglandin E2 EP3 receptor plays a role in ligand selectivity. Misoprostol and misoprostol-free acid were gifts of Dr. Paul Collins (Searle). All other prostanoid analogs were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Isoproterenol, ascorbic acid, and indomethacin were purchased from Sigma. [3H]PGE2 was purchased from DuPont NEN. LipofectAMINE, and Opti-MEM were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Missense mutations were introduced using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously (9Audoly L. Breyer R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 57: 61-68Google Scholar). The sequence of the flanking oligonucleotides was as follows: upstream oligonucleotide (EP3 nucleotide 501 coding), 5′ TG GTG TAC CTA TCC AGG 3′; downstream oligonucleotide (EP3 nucleotide 963 coding), 5′ CCA GGG ATC CAA TAT CTG G 3′. The internal oligonucleotides used to introduce missense mutations are listed as follows (with underlining indicating nucleotide substitutions): QA198: 5′ A CAG TAC ACG ATC GCG TGG CCC GG 3′; WA199, 5′ TAC ACC ATC CAA GCTCCC GGG ACG 3′; PS200, 5′ ATC CAG TGG TCA GGTACC TGG TGC TTC 3′; TA202, 5′ TC CAG TGG CCTGGT GCT TGG TGC TTC 3′; WA203, 5′ G TGG CCT GGT ACCGCA TGC TTC ATC AGC 3′; CA204, 5′ CAG TGG CCT GGTACC TGG GCT TTC ATC AGC3′; FA205, 5′ GT TGG CCC GGT ACG TGG TGC GCA ATC AGT AC 3′. PCR fragments encoding the target amino acid substitutions were then subcloned into the hemagglutinin-tagged 77A isoform of the EP3 receptor in plasmid 77A hemagglutinin wt pRC/CMV, generating the full-length EP3 77A receptor (9Audoly L. Breyer R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 57: 61-68Google Scholar). Two independent clones bearing each amino acid substitution were then isolated and characterized in subsequent experiments. The identity of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing both strands of the PCR amplified region using a ThermoSequenase kit (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). HEK293tsA201 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids bearing wt or mutant EP3 cDNA as described (9Audoly L. Breyer R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 57: 61-68Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 72 h, and the medium was replaced every 24 h. At 72 h cells were lysed and membranes prepared as described (16Breyer R.M. Emeson R.B. Breyer M.D. Abromson R.M. Davis L.S. Ferrenbach S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 298: 6163-6169Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). For saturation binding isotherm experiments, 10–40 μg of membrane protein, representing 20 fmol of receptor, was incubated with various concentrations of [3H]PGE2, and reactions were stopped by filtration onto glass fiber filters as described (9Audoly L. Breyer R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 57: 61-68Google Scholar). For competition binding assays, 10–40 μg of membrane proteins were incubated with 1 nm [3H]PGE2 and varying concentrations of unlabeled competitor and assayed as described above. HEK293tsA201 cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids containing the human β2AR and either the wt or mutant EP3 receptor. cAMP measurements were performed by radioimmunoassay as described (9Audoly L. Breyer R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 57: 61-68Google Scholar). Saturation binding isotherms, competition binding isotherms, and dose-dependent responses of [cAMP]i were analyzed using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).Ki values were calculated using the method of Cheng and Prusoff (17Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using Instat (GraphPad). Sequence alignments of the cloned rabbit EP3 receptor was performed against all cloned prostanoid receptors (9Audoly L. Breyer R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 57: 61-68Google Scholar). A cluster of six conserved amino acid residues was identified in the putative second extracellular loop (Fig.1). The sequence was identified asQ 198 WPGTWCF, where bold characters represent conserved amino acids. Pro200 is conserved throughout all cloned prostanoid receptors with the exception of the FP receptor. We tested whether this conserved portion of the receptor plays a role in the prostaglandin EP3 receptor function and/or structure. TA202 displayed markedly increased affinities for methyl ester compounds of the E series as compared with the wild type receptor despite displaying similar dissociation constants for [3H]PGE2( Kdwt = 1.4 ± 0.3 nm, KdTA202 = 1.3 ± 0.1 nm). As shown in Fig.2 A, TA202 resulted in a 128-fold increase in affinity for misoprostol as compared with the wild type receptor ( Kiwt = 1600 ± 350 nm, KiTA202 = 13 ± 3 nm). In contrast, the affinity of TA202 for the carboxylate derivative misoprostol-free acid increased a modest 2-fold ( Kiwt) = 6.5 ± 1.9 nm, KiTA202 = 3.3 ± 0.6 nm). The Ki values for other natural and synthetic prostanoid agonists with a carboxylate at the C1 position were not statistically different from wild type (TableI). Sulprostone, which has a sulfonamide moiety at C1, had a modest 3-fold increase in affinity. To test if the increased affinity for misoprostol could be extended to other E series methyl ester compounds, TA202 was assayed with a panel of paired methyl ester/carboxylate prostanoid analogs that differed in their substituents at positions which differ between PGE2 and misoprostol: substitution at the C15 and C16 position and presence or absence of a double bond between C5 and C6. For each compound tested TA202 displayed increased affinity for the methyl ester compound from 38- to 128-fold as compared with wild type; however, the affinities for the carboxylate analog of each pair was not statistically different from wt (Table II).

The identity of Trp199 is not highly conserved among prostanoid receptors as tyrosine, phenylalanine, or alanine may be found at this position. Nonetheless, substitution of Trp199with alanine resulted in a similar phenotype to the TA202 receptor. WA199 displayed a 9-fold increase in affinity for misoprostol and a 3-fold increase in affinity for sulprostone while theKi values for other compounds tested remained unaffected (Table I). Proline 200 is conserved among the EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, DP, IP, and TP receptors across species. In the FP receptor, this position is occupied by a serine residue. Pro200 of the EP3 receptor was mutated to Ser, and its binding characteristics were determined. The KdPS200 = 4.1 ± 0.5 nm versusKdwt = 1.4 ± 0.3 nm suggested a modest loss of [3H]PGE2 affinity for PS200 (two-tailedp value < 0.01). Competition binding isotherms resulted in a loss of specificity for PS200 as determined using PGE2, PGD2, and PGF2α. The PS200 receptor displayed a 4-fold loss in affinity for PGE2; however, it gained 3- and 5-fold in affinity for PGF2αand PGD2, respectively (Table I, Fig. 3). Similarly, results obtained with the synthetic PGE analogs sulprostone and misoprostol-free acid demonstrated a 5–7-fold decrease in affinity, while misoprostol displayed a 5-fold increase in affinity. Thus, the overall pattern for the PS200 substitution was a loss in affinity for compounds that bind with high affinity to wt and an increase for compounds that bind with lower affinity to wt receptor. These results suggest Pro200 plays a crucial role maintaining ligand binding selectivity. Substitution with alanine at the positions Gln198, Trp203, Cys204, and Phe205 did not affect the binding profile of these receptors despite absolute conservation of the primary structure at these positions among all cloned prostanoid receptors. Membranes prepared from cells transfected with each receptor were tested in saturation binding (data not shown) and competition binding isotherms with the panel of natural and synthetic prostanoid analogs, and no statistically significant changes in affinity or order of agonist potency were observed (Table I). These results argue against the role of each individual residues in receptor-ligand interactions. Signal transduction properties of each receptor variant were determined. As compared with the wild type receptor (EC50 = 480 pm), the various receptor EC50 values were: QA198 = 550 pm, WA199 = 360 pm, PS200 = 500 pm, TA202 = 370 pm, WA203 = 400 pm, CA204 = 370 pm, FA205 = 200 pm) and did not display any statistically significant differences in receptor evoked signaling in three independent experiments. Using site-directed mutagenesis studies of the prostaglandin EP3 receptor, the present results demonstrate that the second extracellular loop plays an integral role in receptor-ligand interaction and particularly in ligand selectivity. The gainof agonist affinity observed for several mutant receptor phenotypes argues strongly against gross perturbation of receptor structure by these amino acid substitutions as the cause of the altered ligand binding phenotypes. The precise role of the second extracellular loop in receptor-ligand interaction is unknown. One possible explanation for the observed phenotype is that the second extracellular loop forms part of the binding pocket and is in direct contact with the bound ligand. Alternatively, the effects of these mutations may be the result of an indirect role of the second extracellular loop. This is analogous to the Ca2+, Na+, or K+ channels where it has been proposed that extracellular loops fold into the ion channel pore and interact with the transmembrane helices (18MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 889-892Google Scholar). A third possibility is that the loop is important for the overall conformation of the receptor without direct interaction with the transmembrane helices. This interpretation may be consistent with the idea that modification of Trp199, Pro200, or Thr202 induces a general relaxation of the receptor conformation, preventing it from discriminating structurally related prostanoid analogs. Several models supporting a direct role of extracellular domains of peptide/amino acid binding GPCRs have been described in the literature. In the case of the receptor for parathyroid hormone, it was suggested that amino acid residues near the extracellular surface of the transmembrane helices play a “filter” role allowing discrimination between various ligands (19Turner R.P. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Google Scholar). This concept could be extended to the EP3 receptor, where it is conceivable to consider Thr202 or Trp199 as filters which reduce affinity for compounds with a C1 methyl ester. Elimination of Thr202 or Trp199 side chains results in the elimination of a “gate” preventing methyl ester prostanoids from accessing the binding cleft. This model argues in favor of a two-step process in terms of receptor-ligand interaction. It has been suggested for the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGLUR1, that the extracellular region of the receptor may act as a primary point of receptor-ligand interaction or “bait” and subsequently facilitate presentation to the transmembrane ligand pocket (20O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Google Scholar). Similarly, this model may be applied to the second extracellular loop of the EP3receptor, whereby Trp199, Pro200, and/or Thr202 attract ligands and present them to the binding pocket. The filter and bait models are not mutually exclusive and may be complementary to one another. It is interesting to note that mutation of Cys204, which is conserved among all cloned prostanoid receptors, caused no detectable change in ligand binding affinity or receptor activation. These results are in sharp contrast to the results presented for the thromboxane A2 receptor, where replacement of Cys183 to Ser (analogous position as Cys204) led a complete loss of binding and signaling (6D'Angelo D.D. Eubank J.J. Davis M.G. Dorn III, G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6233-6240Google Scholar). These authors suggested that a critical disulfide bond existed between Cys183 and Cys105 (transmembrane domain III) of the thromboxane A2 receptor; however, results presented here argue against the importance of a putative disulfide bridge involving Cys204 in the EP3 receptor. It is also of interest that within this highly conserved amino-terminal portion of the second extracellular loop, substitutions at the other absolutely conserved positions Gln198, Trp203, Cys204, and Phe205 did not detectably affect ligand binding or signal transduction. It may be that substitutions at several positions are required to disrupt receptor function. Alternatively, an untested function (e.g.internalization/recycling) may have been altered. We propose a revised version of the model currently described for the EP3 receptor (21Yamamoto Y. Kamiya K. Terao S. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 820-825Google Scholar). We had previously shown that the EP3 and EP4 receptors displayed increased affinities for carboxylate compounds versus their methyl ester derivatives (9Audoly L. Breyer R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 57: 61-68Google Scholar, 12Breyer R.M. Davis L.S. Nian C. Redha R. Stillman B. Jacobson H.R. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F485-F493Google Scholar). Furthermore, a large body of literature has suggested that the carboxylate moiety of C1 interacts with the positive side chain of arginine in transmembrane VII. The above results with TA202 suggest that a negative charge on C1 of prostanoids isnot required for high affinity interactions with the EP3 receptor as shown for the TA202 receptor. Based on the high degree of homology of the second extracellular loop among cloned prostanoid receptors, it is conceivable these findings may be generalized to some or all of the prostanoid receptors. This may suggest that a revised three-dimensional model incorporating the extracellular loop regions is required to interpret receptor-ligand interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2323337480,"Quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells can be induced to re-enter the cell cycle by stimulation of a variety of growth factor-dependent signal transduction cascades. We have utilised this cell system to investigate the point of convergence of mitogenic signalling by analysing the changes that distinct mitogens induce in the components of the cell cycle regulatory machinery (the G1 cyclins, cdks and their inhibitors). In the presence of insulin, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase caused a dramatic post-transcriptional down-regulation of p27(Kip1), an increase in cyclin D3 but had little effect on cyclin D1 levels, whilst activation of protein kinase C had a more modest effect on cyclin D3 and p27(Kip1) but caused a striking elevation in the expression of cyclin D1. The neuropeptide bombesin, when combined with insulin, caused increased expression of cyclin D1 and down-regulation of p27(Kip1) mRNA and protein. Thus each combination of mitogenic agents had different effects on the components responsible for regulating the orderly progression of the cell cycle. This outcome is incompatible with a single route to mitogenesis and demonstrates that different mitogens remain distinct in the signalling responses they initiate, only converging at the levels of the expression of the D-type cyclins and the inhibitor p27(Kip1)."

Rearrangements of the NFKB-2 locus leading to the production of 3' truncated NFKB-2 proteins are recurrently found in lymphoid neoplasms, particularly cutaneous lymphomas. Such mutant NFKB-2 proteins have lost the ability to repress transcription that is typical of NFKB-2 subunit p52, and function as constitutive transcriptional activators. To verify whether the expression of abnormal NFKB-2 proteins can lead to malignant transformations in mammalian cells, we transfected human lymphoblastoid cell lines and murine fibroblasts (Balb/3T3) with expression vectors carrying the cDNAs coding for normal NFKB-2p52, Lyt-10C alpha or LB40 proteins, which are representative of the abnormal types found in lymphoma cases. The expression of both normal and mutant NFKB-2 proteins has a lethal effect on lymphoblastoid cells and a cytotoxic effect was also observed in murine fibroblasts. The fibroblast cell lines expressing Lyt-10C alpha or LB40, but not those expressing normal NFKB-2p52, were capable of forming colonies in soft agar. The analysis of individual clones revealed that cloning efficiency correlated with the expression levels of the abnormal proteins. Injection of the Lyt-10C alpha-transfected Balb cells in SCID mice led to tumor formation in all of the animals, whereas no tumors were observed in the mice injected with control or NFKB-2p52-transfected cells, thus indicating that abnormal NFKB-2 protein expression is tumorigenic in vivo. Our results show that mutant NFKB-2 proteins can lead to the transformed phenotype, and support the hypothesis that alterations in NFKB-2 genes may play a role in lymphomagenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2329738804,"We have examined the role of erbB-2 expression in the modulation of cellular toxicity to cisplatin. We have demonstrated that treatment of NIH3T3-erbB-2 cells, which overexpress the p185(erbB-2) product of the human erbB-2 gene, with a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain (TAb-250), results in enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity. A similar enhancement was obtained when cells were exposed to herbimycin A and its analogue CP127 374, both of which inhibit tyrosine kinase activity. Using the host cell reactivation (HCR) of reporter gene expression from cisplatin-damaged plasmid and unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) following cisplatin treatment of cells, we have found that modulation of erbB-2 by TAb-250 was associated with inhibition of DNA repair. TAb-250 alone, under conditions which modulate DNA repair, slightly reduces the S-phase of the cell cycle, while cisplatin induced arrest at S and G2 phases. Combination of TAb-250 and cisplatin only slightly prevented cisplatin-induced S and G2 blocks. Since the ras pathway is one of the major signaling components coupled to erbB-2, we have examined the role of ras in DNA repair regulation. Transient expression of a ras dominant negative mutant, Asn-17-ras(H), prevents DNA repair modulation by TAb-250, suggesting that the erbB-2 receptor regulates DNA repair mechanism(s), at least in part, through ras-coupled pathway(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1993280039,"A series of inductive events between two different cell groups, the ureteric bud epithelium and metanephric mesenchyme, gives rise to the functional mammalian kidney. These reciprocal inductive interactions involve a number of molecules, one of which is the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. The phenotype of mice lacking functional RET includes kidney agenesis or severe dysgenesis, indicating a requirement for RET in kidney organogenesis. To investigate RET expression in human kidney development, we used a semi-quantitative RT – PCR-based strategy to examine a panel of kidney RNA samples ranging from 8 – 24 weeks gestational age. We found RET expression was highest earlier in development (14 weeks) with expression decreasing through to 24 weeks gestation. While three alternative RET transcripts generated by exon skipping at the 5′ end of the gene were all detected throughout kidney development, expression of one transcript, RET2/6, where exon 2 was spliced to exon 6, varied relative to full length RET during this period. Levels of RET2/6 were highest at the earliest age of fetal kidney examined (8 weeks) and decreased relative to all other RET transcripts to low adult levels. The period of high expression coincides with a period of rapid bud bifurcation. Thus, it is possible that RET2/6 has a role in the early growth and differentiation of the human kidney."

We previously localized a putative breast tumor suppressor gene to a 3 cM region on 17q25 by deletion mapping of microsatellite markers in breast tumors. To determine if the same 17q25 region of loss is important in the genesis of other tumor types, 32 ovarian tumors and 24 prostate tumors, as well as 33 additional breast tumors, were analysed with 17q25 polymorphic microsatellite markers. While no significant loss was observed in prostate tumors, greater than half of ovarian tumors exhibited loss coincident with the candidate region previously defined in breast tumors. These results suggest that one or more novel tumor suppressor genes exist on 17q25 within a concordant region of interstitial loss defined in both breast and ovarian neoplasms."

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Since elastase released by activated neutrophils is rendered inactive by the inhibitor (37Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar), diminished circulating levels can result in proteolytic destruction of lung elastin, a phenomenon implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung disease (38Beith J. Front. Matrix Biol. 1978; 6: 1-4Google Scholar). “Loop-sheet” polymerization is apparently responsible for accumulation of a subset of human AAT variants in the ER of hepatocytes (31Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). However, impaired secretion of the majority of variants does not include detectable intracellular accumulation. Most “null” alleles encode a polypeptide truncated at the carboxyl terminus (39Fabretti G. Sergi C. Consales G. Faa G. Brisigotti M. Romeo G. Callea F. Liver. 1992; 12: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which is a phenomenon predicted to preclude formation of specific secondary structural features (31Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and can prevent loop-sheet polymerization. Variant QO Hong Kong (null(Hong Kong)) cannot attain conformational maturation following biosynthesis, forms a physical interaction with molecular chaperone calnexin (24Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is expected to exhibit a persistent interaction with quality control machinery of the ER. We demonstrate that a detectable interaction between null(Hong Kong) and UGTR results in response to manipulations predicted to diminish ER lumenal Ca2+ stores. Interpretation of these findings with regard to factors responsible for quality control of human AAT folding and secretion are discussed.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, a physical association between immunoreactive UGTR and secretion-incompetent variant null(Hong Kong) was detected in response to incubation of cells with metabolic poisons. The interaction was cumulative and required incubation of cells with both metabolic poisons, sodium fluoride and sodium azide. The exclusion of trypan blue from treated cells and the absence of coprecipitating UGTR following removal of metabolic poisons suggest that formation of the complex did not represent an artifact of cell death. Detection of radiolabeled UGTR in the context of our radiolabeling procedure suggests that it may contain a significant number of methionine residues or exhibit rapid intracellular turnover. Intracellular association between null(Hong Kong) and calnexin was diminished at conditions that induced coprecipitation of UGTR. Because ATP is required to stabilize calnexin-glycoprotein interactions in the ER (43Wada I. Ou W.-J. Liu M.-C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and reduction of nucleotide levels would be expected to dissociate the null(Hong Kong)-calnexin complex.Exogenous ATP had no influence on stability of the accumulated null(Hong Kong)-UGTR interaction, suggesting that lowered intracellular availability of the nucleotide was not solely responsible for intracellular accumulation of the complex. Ability of thapsigargin treatment to result in detectable coprecipitation of p150, plus destabilization of the interaction during a 37 °C incubation with exogenous Ca2+, supported the hypothesis that depletion of ATP by metabolic poisons might have resulted in inactivation of the microsomal Ca2+ATPase pump, leading to reduction of ER lumenal Ca2+ stores. In support of this concept, depletion of ATP in rat liver microsomes induced calcium release and pump inhibition, and these effects were mimicked by thapsigargin treatment. Considering these data, it is reasonable to conclude that reduction of ER lumenal Ca2+, occurring as an indirect effect of depleting intracellular ATP, likely played a significant role in causing detectable accumulation of the null(Hong Kong)-UGTR complex and is also supported by coprecipitation of UGTR in response to mobilization of the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ pool.The physical interaction between null(Hong Kong) and molecular chaperone calnexin (24Le A.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding was the observation that thapsigargin treatment diminished interaction between calnexin and null(Hong Kong). Furthermore, the treatment diminished interaction with calnexin to a greater extent than did metabolic poisons. Despite this fact, coprecipitation of UGTR was not greater in thapsigargin-treated cells, and longer incubations did not result in gradual accumulation of the null(Hong Kong)-UGTR complex (not shown). An explanation for this observation is that thapsigargin treatment may have caused gross structural alterations in the ER in response to rapid mobilization of ER Ca2+ stores which could impair accumulation of the null(Hong Kong)-UGTR complex. In this regard, gradual mobilization of the divalent cation in response to incubation with metabolic poisons might have provided more favorable conditions for intracellular accumulation.A recently proposed model (15Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 17Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) suggests that asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of unfolded glycoproteins participate in a cycle of reglucosylation/deglucosylation in which these events are catalyzed by UGTR and α-glucosidase II, respectively. Cycles of transient interaction with UGTR, each resulting in reglucosylation of attached oligosaccharides, is believed to facilitate interaction between unfolded glycoproteins and calnexin and ensure the retention of improperly folded glycoproteins in the ER. We have observed post-translational incorporation of mannosidase-resistant radiolabel into asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of null(Hong Kong) in H1A/N13 cells incubated with [3H]galactose, 2R. Sifers, unpublished observations. suggesting that they likely participate as substrates for UGTR. Conceivably, the steady-state concentration of the transiently-formed complex is beyond the detection limits of ECL Western blotting. Conceivably, intracellular accumulation of the null(Hong Kong)-UGTR complex would result if the two components normally interact with one another in a transient fashion but require Ca2+ for dissociation. Data generated in the present study lend support to the proposed precursor-product relationship between UGTR association and subsequent assembly with calnexin. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that formation of these null(Hong Kong)-containing complexes, in the context of this study, occurred as mutually exclusive events.Asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of unfolded glycoproteins with the structure of Man7–9GlcNAc2 function as acceptors in the glucose transfer reaction (11Parodi A.J. Mendelzon D.H. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8260-8265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since catalysis of glucose transfer by UGTR is a Ca2+-dependent process (49Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it has been suggested that hydrolysis of UDP-glucose, which is coupled to glucose transfer, may provide the energy necessary for dissociating bound glycoproteins from UGTR (8Fernandez F. Jannatipour M. Hellman U. Rokeach L.A. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have been unable to demonstrate transfer of glucose to oligosaccharides of null(Hong Kong) during Ca2+-dependent dissociation of UGTR, but this may reflect poor detection limits associated with our analysis. Also, Ca2+-dependent dissociation of UGTR does not occur following coprecipitation of the complex, even in the presence of UDP-glucose. 3P. Choudhury, unpublished observation. If dissociation is coupled to glucose transfer then binding of the antibody to null(Hong Kong) may somehow interfere with recognition of oligosaccharides by UGTR.The concept that UGTR might participate in glycoprotein folding and quality control originally emerged from experiments performed in cell-free systems. However, in a recent report, Fernandez et al. (8Fernandez F. Jannatipour M. Hellman U. Rokeach L.A. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) detected a 2–9-fold induction of UGTR mRNA inSchizosaccharomyces pombe at conditions known to perturb glycoprotein folding and induce synthesis of stress proteins. The structural gene was cloned and compared with that in Drosophila melanogaster. A conserved yeast heat shock promoter sequence was detected in the 5′ terminus, providing an explanation of how its expression is induced similar to that of several stress proteins. Our observations demonstrating that intracellular accumulation of the null(Hong Kong)-UGTR complex lend additional support to this hypothesis. Co-immunoprecipitation of intracellular complexes containing AAT furnishes an opportunity to subject the quality control model to experimental analysis, which will provide further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema resulting from severe plasma AAT deficiency. In eukaryotes, proteins destined for secretion are translocated as nascent polypeptides into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; AAT, α1-antitrypsin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; UGTR, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; AAT, α1-antitrypsin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; UGTR, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase.

Folding into the native conformation, a structure dictated by the primary amino acid sequence (2Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5079) Google Scholar), is facilitated through transient interaction with one or more molecular chaperones (3Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3575) Google Scholar). Conformational fidelity of folded structures is monitored by a poorly understood quality control system (4Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) which prevents transport of incompletely folded and unassembled proteins beyond the ER (5Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Cotranslational addition of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to specific asparagine residues and hydrolysis of attached glucose units can accompany translocation of the nascent polypeptide (6Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar). Reglucosylation of high mannose-type glycans has been detected in microsomal preparations from mammals, plants, fungi, yeast, and protozoa (7Trombetta S. Bosch M. Parodi A.J.

Importantly, only high mannose-type oligosaccharides attached to unfolded proteins function as acceptors in the glucose transfer reaction (11Parodi A.J. Mendelzon D.H. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol.

In support of this idea, Labriola et al. (22Labriola C. Cazzulo J.J. Parodi A.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have reported that delivery of a nascent acid hydrolase to lysosomes of Trypanosoma cruzi is delayed by inhibition of ER α-glucosidase activity and is a predictable response if attached monoglucosylated oligosaccharides are interacting with calnexin. Recent evidence suggests that protein folding and quality control machinery may participate in the molecular pathogenesis of several human diseases caused by defective intracellular transport of an aberrantly folded protein through the secretory pathway (23Amara J.F.

Because ATP is required to stabilize calnexin-glycoprotein interactions in the ER (43Wada I. Ou W.-J. Liu M.-C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and reduction of nucleotide levels would be expected to dissociate the null(Hong Kong)-calnexin complex. Exogenous ATP had no influence on stability of the accumulated null(Hong Kong)-UGTR interaction, suggesting that lowered intracellular availability of the nucleotide was not solely responsible for intracellular accumulation of the complex. Ability of thapsigargin treatment to result in detectable coprecipitation of p150, plus destabilization of the interaction during a 37 °C incubation with exogenous Ca2+, supported the hypothesis that depletion of ATP by metabolic poisons might have resulted in inactivation of the microsomal Ca2+ATPase pump, leading to reduction of ER lumenal Ca2+ stores. In support of this concept, depletion of ATP in rat liver microsomes induced calcium release and pump inhibition, and these effects were mimicked by thapsigargin treatment. Considering these data, it is reasonable to conclude that reduction of ER lumenal Ca2+, occurring as an indirect effect of depleting intracellular ATP, likely played a significant role in causing detectable accumulation of the null(Hong Kong)-UGTR complex and is also supported by coprecipitation of UGTR in response to mobilization of the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ pool. The physical interaction between null(Hong Kong) and molecular chaperone calnexin (24Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) is disrupted by incubation with Ca2+ chelators (24Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding was the observation that thapsigargin treatment diminished interaction between calnexin and null(Hong Kong). Furthermore, the treatment diminished interaction with calnexin to a greater extent than did metabolic poisons. Despite this fact, coprecipitation of UGTR was not greater in thapsigargin-treated cells, and longer incubations did not result in gradual accumulation of the null(Hong Kong)-UGTR complex (not shown). An explanation for this observation is that thapsigargin treatment may have caused gross structural alterations in the ER in response to rapid mobilization of ER Ca2+ stores which could impair accumulation of the null(Hong Kong)-UGTR complex. In this regard, gradual mobilization of the divalent cation in response to incubation with metabolic poisons might have provided more favorable conditions for intracellular accumulation. A recently proposed model (15Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 17Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) suggests that asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of unfolded glycoproteins participate in a cycle of reglucosylation/deglucosylation in which these events are catalyzed by UGTR and α-glucosidase II, respectively. Cycles of transient interaction with UGTR, each resulting in reglucosylation of attached oligosaccharides, is believed to facilitate interaction between unfolded glycoproteins and calnexin and ensure the retention of improperly folded glycoproteins in the ER. We have observed post-translational incorporation of mannosidase-resistant radiolabel into asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of null(Hong Kong) in H1A/N13 cells incubated with [3H]galactose, 2R. Sifers, unpublished observations. suggesting that they likely participate as substrates for UGTR. Conceivably, the steady-state concentration of the transiently-formed complex is beyond the detection limits of ECL Western blotting. Conceivably, intracellular accumulation of the null(Hong Kong)-UGTR complex would result if the two components normally interact with one another in a transient fashion but require Ca2+ for dissociation. Data generated in the present study lend support to the proposed precursor-product relationship between UGTR association and subsequent assembly with calnexin. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that formation of these null(Hong Kong)-containing complexes, in the context of this study, occurred as mutually exclusive events. Asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of unfolded glycoproteins with the structure of Man7–9GlcNAc2 function as acceptors in the glucose transfer reaction (11Parodi A.J. Mendelzon D.H. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8260-8265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since catalysis of glucose transfer by UGTR is a Ca2+-dependent process (49Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it has been suggested that hydrolysis of UDP-glucose, which is coupled to glucose transfer, may provide the energy necessary for dissociating bound glycoproteins from UGTR (8Fernandez F. Jannatipour M. Hellman U. Rokeach L.A. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have been unable to demonstrate transfer of glucose to oligosaccharides of null(Hong Kong) during Ca2+-dependent dissociation of UGTR, but this may reflect poor detection limits associated with our analysis. Also, Ca2+-dependent dissociation of UGTR does not occur following coprecipitation of the complex, even in the presence of UDP-glucose. 3P. Choudhury, unpublished observation. If dissociation is coupled to glucose transfer then binding of the antibody to null(Hong Kong) may somehow interfere with recognition of oligosaccharides by UGTR. The concept that UGTR might participate in glycoprotein folding and quality control originally emerged from experiments performed in cell-free systems. However, in a recent report, Fernandez et al. (8Fernandez F. Jannatipour M. Hellman U. Rokeach L.A. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) detected a 2–9-fold induction of UGTR mRNA inSchizosaccharomyces pombe at conditions known to perturb glycoprotein folding and induce synthesis of stress proteins. The structural gene was cloned and compared with that in Drosophila melanogaster. A conserved yeast heat shock promoter sequence was detected in the 5′ terminus, providing an explanation of how its expression is induced similar to that of several stress proteins. Our observations demonstrating that intracellular accumulation of the null(Hong Kong)-UGTR complex lend additional support to this hypothesis. Co-immunoprecipitation of intracellular complexes containing AAT furnishes an opportunity to subject the quality control model to experimental analysis, which will provide further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema resulting from severe plasma AAT deficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2324277855,"Fibroblast growth factors mediate cellular responses by interacting with a family of related receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFRs). We have previously shown that FGFR-1, but not of FGFR-4, ectopically expressed in BaF3 lymphoid cells allows for proliferation in response to FGFs, and that the intracellular signaling halves of these two receptors distinguish their mitogenic potentials (Wang et al., 1994). In order to map the residues which functionally distinguish these receptors, a panel of chimeric receptors whose cytodomains bear different contributions from FGFR-1 and FGFR-4 were constructed and characterized. The behavior of these chimeras implicate amino acids from both the kinase insert and kinase domains in receptor-mediated proliferation. Specifically, two tyrosine residues present in the short kinase insert domain of FGFR-1 and absent from FGFR-4 are a necessary, but not sufficient, component of a fully mitogenic receptor, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation in the kinase insert promotes a mitogenic signaling pathway. A strongly mitogenic receptor also requires one or two FGFR-1-specific residues from either of two regions within the kinase domain. One of these regions is within the kinase domain's activation loop, where FGFR-1, but not FGFR-4, bears a key aspartate residue. The mitogenic potentials of FGFR-1, FGFR-4, and the chimeric receptors strongly correlates with the magnitude of ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation in BaF3 cells. We discuss mechanisms by which these few key amino acid differences may determine the levels of ligand-induced FGF receptor autophosphorylation and mitogenic potency."

Regulated fusion is a critical feature of heterotypic membrane interactions involved in vesicular transport of cargo through the exocytic and endocytic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 1Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Google Scholar) and homotypic events leading to the reassembly of intracellular organelles following their disassembly during mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 2Warren G.

Cell. 1995; 82: 885-893Google Scholar), the latter being a member of a larger gene family of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive AAA ATPases, which includes the intra-Golgi targeting/fusion factor NSF (reviewed in Refs. 3Rothman J.E.

Similarly, liver ER microsomes inactivated by NEM lack fusion activity (14Sokoloff A.V. Whalley T. Zimmerberg J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 23-30Google Scholar). Moreover, the mammalian homolog to Cdc48p, p97, in conjunction with NSF has been shown to be required for homotypic fusion of vesiculated Golgi membranes (6Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.-M. Watson N. Farquhar M. Malhotra M. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Google Scholar, 7Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.-M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Google Scholar). The potential role of p97 in the fusion of mammalian ER membranes has not been tested.In addition to a role for members of the AAA ATPase gene family in fusion, Rab GTPases have also been shown to be essential for the targeting and/or fusion of membranes throughout the exocytic and endocytic pathways (reviewed in Refs. 20Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Google Scholar and 21Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Google Scholar). Morphological, genetic, and biochemical approaches have revealed an essential role for Rab1 in ER to Golgi transport in mammalian cells (22Nuoffer C.N. Davidson H.W. Matteson J. Meinkoth J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 125: 225-237Google Scholar, 23Plutner H. Cox A.D. Pind S. Khosravi-Far R. Bourne J.R. Schwaninger R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J.

Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Google Scholar). Rab5 is involved in the homotypic fusion of endosomes (26Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Google Scholar), whereas Ypt7p is involved in the homotypic fusion of yeast vacuoles (8Haas A. Scheglmann D. Lazar T. Gallwitz D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5258-5270Google Scholar, 9Haas A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3296-3305Google Scholar). Given the participation of different Rab GTPases in homotypic fusion of at least two intracellular compartments, a novel Rab protein may also mediate homotypic fusion of ER membranes. To test this hypothesis, in the present study we describe the development of a simple ELISA-based assay, which allows us to efficiently quantitate the fusion of mammalian ER microsomes. We now report that fusion is mediated by a small monomeric GTPase(s) belonging to the Rab family.RESULTSThe ER is an organelle that specializes in the folding and oligomerization of proteins for export. We previously described a cell-free assay based on the ability of radiolabeled ([35S]) heavy (H) and light (L) chain containing ER microsomes prepared from two different cell lines to promote the fusion-dependent oligomerization of mature IgG molecules (12Watkins J.D. Hermanowski A.L. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5182-5192Google Scholar). Using this assay, we demonstrated that H2L2 assembly is efficient (∼50% of the total H and L chain pool is assembled) and that oligomerization is not rate-limiting. Therefore, the rate assembly of mature IgG is a direct measure of membrane fusion.We now report the development of an ELISA assay to more rapidly quantitate ER fusion. This assay encompasses the general principles of the previous fusion reaction (12Watkins J.D. Hermanowski A.L. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5182-5192Google Scholar) in that microsomes are prepared from Ag8(8) and P3U.1 cells expressing the IgG H and L chains, respectively. Incubation at 32 °C in the presence of ATP and cytosol leads to luminal continuity between the two membrane populations and oligomerization of the H and L chains to form mature IgG. To quantitate the appearance of H2L2, membranes are solubilized by detergent and centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and the supernatant is added to protein G-protein-coated ELISA plates, which bind the H chain found only in mature H2L2. Unbound material is removed by washing, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. The amount of H2L2 in each well is quantitated by spectroscopy.Fig. 1 shows the kinetics of the reaction over a 30-min time course in the absence or the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. The addition of detergent allows us to distinguish between the appearance of H2L2 from bonafide fusion-dependent assembly of sealed membranes and fusion-independent oligomerization, which as shown previously (12Watkins J.D. Hermanowski A.L. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5182-5192Google Scholar) can occur if the membranes are lysed by addition of detergent at the beginning of the incubation. Using intact membranes, there is a rapid onset of H2L2 assembly that proceeds at a linear rate following a brief lag (<1–2 min) and reaches a plateau after 15 min of incubation (Fig. 1). In contrast, in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100, the kinetics of H2L2assembly has a prolonged lag period (10 min) and a reduced rate. The reduced kinetics of H2L2 assembly in the presence of detergent undoubtedly reflects the loss of the highly specialized folding/oligmerization environment of the ER (12Watkins J.D. Hermanowski A.L. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5182-5192Google Scholar). Given the kinetic differences between assembly observed in the absence or the presence of detergent, incubations are limited to the 15-min time period where nonluminal H2L2 assembly in response to any potential membrane lysis would contribute only minimally to the signal derived from fusion-related assembly. A detergent-treated sample is always included as an internal control in each experiment, and this value, which measures the maximal contribution of luminal independent assembly, is subtracted from all reported values. All of the basic properties of the ELISA based assay were found to be identical to those reported for ER fusion detected by appearance of radiolabeled H2 L2 (12Watkins J.D. Hermanowski A.L. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5182-5192Google Scholar) (not shown).Previous studies by our group and others using GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs such as GTPγS have suggested a potential role for GTPases in the fusion of mammalian ER membranes (12Watkins J.D. Hermanowski A.L. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5182-5192Google Scholar, 15Dawson A.P. Comerford J.G. Cell Calcium. 1989; 10: 343-350Google Scholar, 16Paiement J. Beaufay H. Godelaine D. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 29-37Google Scholar). To define the GTP requirement for ER assembly, we first examined whether the GTP-dependent step required a membrane-associated or cytosolic component. Pretreatment of cytosol with 50 μmGTPγS for 15 min at 32 °C in the presence of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system, followed by the addition of 10 mmGTP to neutralize the inhibitory effect of GTPγS, had no effect on the subsequent ability of cytosol stimulate H2L2 assembly compared with untreated cytosol (not shown). In contrast, the addition of GTPγS to the assay potently inhibited ER fusion (Fig. 2 A, lane g) (12Watkins J.D. Hermanowski A.L. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5182-5192Google Scholar). Identical results were observed with GDPβS (Fig.2 A, lane h), suggesting that ER fusion requires a complete GTPase cycle. No effect of either analog was observed on the assembly of H2L2 in the presence of detergent (not shown).Figure 2ER fusion is mediated by a Rab GTPase.

We conclude that the Sar1 and ARF1 GTPases are not involved in ER assembly.Rab family GTPases are believed to play an unknown but critical role in vesicle targeting and fusion (reviewed in Ref. 21Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Google Scholar). To test if members of the Rab GTPase family are involved in ER assembly, we treated membranes with Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), a protein essential for the cycling of Rab between GDP- and GTP-bound forms. Previous studies have demonstrated that GDI binds exclusively to the GDP-bound form of Rab proteins and that the addition of GDI to a variety of Rab-dependent in vitro fusion assays leads to potent inhibition (33Lombardi D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 794-797Google Scholar), presumably due to the ability of GDI to efficiently extract the GDP-bound form of Rab proteins from the membrane (reviewed in Refs. 37Wu S.-K. Zeng K.

As shown in Fig. 2 A, preincubation of microsomes with GDI on ice prior to incubation at 32 °C leads to a complete, dose-dependent inhibition of fusion with an IC50 of ∼0.5 μm. Pretreatment of either membrane alone was sufficient to inactivate fusion (not shown), emphasizing the need for Rab on each fusion partner. No inhibition of H2L2 assembly was observed in the presence of detergent (not shown), demonstrating that GDI blocks the fusion of intact membranes. As additional controls, we examined the effect of selected GDI mutants on ER fusion. Residues involved in Rab binding have been recently shown to occur in sequence conserved regions, which form a compact structure at the apex of GDI (39Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Google Scholar). Mutation of the surface residues Tyr39, Tyr249, or Met250 found in sequence conserved regions 1 and 3B, respectively, potently block the ability of GDI to bind Rab in vitro and to extract Rab from membranes (39Schalk I.

Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Google Scholar) and prevent the ability of GDI to inhibit ER to Golgi transport in vitro (34Peter F. Nuoffer C. Pind S.N. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1393-1406Google Scholar). 2W. E. Balch, unpublished results. Incubation of ER microsomes with these mutants at a 5-fold excess over the concentration of wild-type GDI necessary to elicit complete inhibition of ER assembly (Fig. 2 A) had at most a modest effect on ER fusion (Fig.2 B). In addition, Rho-GDI, which extracts Rho GTPases and inactivates Rho/Rac-dependent events (reviewed in Ref. 40Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Google Scholar), had no effect on ER assembly at concentrations up to 50 μm (not shown). Assembly does not require the Rab1 isoform involved in ER to Golgi and intra-Golgi transport because addition of a trans-dominant mutant (Rab1A[N124I]), which fails to bind guanine nucleotide and which potently inhibits the fusion of ER-derived vesicles to Golgi compartments (22Nuoffer C.N.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1343-1355Google Scholar), had no effect on homotypic fusion (Fig. 2 A, lane f). These results demonstrate that a novel Rab protein is required for the homotypic fusion of ER membranes.To assess whether the requirement for Rab in ER assembly occurs in conjunction with the activity of a NEM-sensitive factor(s), we first examined whether our assay is sensitive to sulfhydryl alkylating reagents. Although NEM has been widely used in the past to inactivate AAA ATPase family members and found to inhibit the GTP-dependent assembly of liver microsomes (14Sokoloff A.V. Whalley T. Zimmerberg J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 23-30Google Scholar), it is membrane permeant and would be expected to inactivate sulhydryl groups required for the assembly of H and L chains in the lumen of the ER. We therefore examined the effects of a number of membrane-impermeant analogs of NEM including sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SMPB, and sulfo-SMCC on the ability of membranes or cytosol to promote fusion (Fig.3 A). Following treatment for 15 min on ice, the reagents were inactivated by the addition of excess glutathione, and the treated membranes or cytosol were subsequently incubated in the presence of ATP for 15 min at 32 °C. Whereas treatment of cytosol had little effect on ER assembly (Fig. 3 A, lanes b and c), pretreatment of microsomes with each of the reagents completely inhibited the appearance of assembled H2L2 (Fig. 3 A, lanes d–g). As expected, a similar effect was observed in the presence of detergent (not shown) due to alkylation of the sensitive sulfhydryl groups required for H and L chain oligmerization. To avoid the possibility that ER microsomes were potentially leaky to these membrane impermeant regents, we also analyzed the effect of a large bulky thiol-blocking reagent, BSA-PDP synthesized by conjugating the bifunctional reagent N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate to BSA (14Sokoloff A.V. Whalley T. Zimmerberg J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 23-30Google Scholar, 42Carlsson J. Drevin H. Axen R. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 723-737Google Scholar). Previous studies using fluorescent quenching as a measured of fusion of rat liver ER microsomes have shown that this reagent inhibits lipid bilayer mixing (14Sokoloff A.V. Whalley T. Zimmerberg J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 23-30Google Scholar). H and/or L chain-containing microsomes were pretreated with BSA-PDP for 15 min on ice. Following neutralization of unreacted PDP groups with excess glutathione, membranes were incubated for 15 min at 32 °C. Treatment of either the H or L chain containing membranes alone was sufficient to inactivate fusion of ER membranes when mixed with the untreated partner (Fig. 3 A, lanes h–j). No effect was observed with unmodified BSA (not shown). Attempts to reactivate the fusion of ER membranes pretreated with either the membrane impermeant NEM analogs or BSA-PDP using purified NSF or p97, two AAA ATPases previously implicated in yeast ER and mammalian Golgi reassembly (6Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.-M. Watson N. Farquhar M. Malhotra M. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Google Scholar, 7Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.-M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Google Scholar, 17Latterich M. Frohlich K.-U. R. S. Cell. 1995; 82: 885-893Google Scholar), were unsuccessful (not shown).Figure 3A, ER fusion is inhibited by pretreatment with sulhydryl-blocking reagents. Cytosol (band c) or microsomes (d–j) were preincubated separately (b, c, h, andi) or together (a, d–g, andj) on ice for 15 min with the indicated reagents (final concentrations: 0.1 mm for NEM and sulfo-analogs, 1 mm [PDP] for BSA-PDP (14Sokoloff A.V. Whalley T. Zimmerberg J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 23-30Google Scholar)). Following the addition of 2 mm glutathione to neutralize excess reagent, treated and untreated membranes/cytosol were combined and incubated for 15 min at 32 °C in the presence of ATP, and H2L2assembly was quantitated by ELISA. B, microsomes incubated in the presence of ATP and cytosol at 32 °C for the indicated time (Δt) were transferred to ice and either held on ice (▪) or supplemented with 2 μm GDI (□), 50 μmGTPγS (○), or BSA-PDP (1 mm PDP) (•) (final concentrations). After 30 min on ice, GDI treated samples were transferred to 32 °C and incubated for a total time of 15 min. After 15 min on ice, BSA-PDP of GTPγS treated samples were supplemented with either 2 mm glutathione (BSA-PDP-treated samples) or 10 mm GTP (GTPγS-treated samples) to neutralize excess reagent, transferred to 32 °C, and incubated for a total time of 15 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To assess the temporal sensitivity of the assay to Rab activation or sulfhydryl-blocking reagents, membranes were incubated for increasing time at 32 °C. At the indicated time (Fig. 3 B, Δt), membranes were transferred to ice and either retained on ice (Fig. 3 B, closed squares) or treated with GDI (Fig. 3 B, open squares), GTPγS (Fig.3 B, open circles), or BSA-PDP (Fig.3 B, closed circles) and reincubated at 32 °C for a total time of 15 min. The addition of BSA-PDP (Fig.3 B, closed circles) inhibited the assembly of H2L2 only when added within the first 2–5 min of incubation at 32 °C, confirming that H2L2assembly is inaccessible to the bulky thiol-containing reagent. Similar results were observed with membrane impermeant NEM analogs (not shown). Although the temporal sensitivity to GTPγS yielded a similar result to that of sulfhydryl blocking reagents (Fig. 3 B, open circles), H2L2 assembly remained sensitive to GDI throughout the entire time course (Fig. 3 B,open squares)). The addition of GDI at any time point abruptly blocked ER fusion, similar to the effect of transferring cells to ice (Fig. 3 B, closed squares). Thus, the requirement for Rab is a transient event, occurring immediately prior to membrane fusion.DISCUSSIONWe have developed a convenient ELISA assay to measure homotypic ER fusion based on the unique protein folding environment of the ER (12Watkins J.D. Hermanowski A.L. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5182-5192Google Scholar). Fusion of H and L chain containing microsomes requires a factor sensitive to sulfhydryl blocking reagents, as has been observed previously in other assays that measure ER assembly using fluorescent lipid probes (11Latterich M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 78: 87-98Google Scholar, 13Orsel J.G. Bartoldus I. Stegmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3369-3375Google Scholar, 14Sokoloff A.V. Whalley T. Zimmerberg J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 23-30Google Scholar). Consistent with the observation that NSF cannot reverse the GTP-dependent fusion of microsomes prepared from rat liver (14Sokoloff A.V. Whalley T. Zimmerberg J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 23-30Google Scholar), we have been unable to reverse NEM-inhibited ER fusion by either purified NSF or p97, proteins that are required for the reassembly of NEM-treated Golgi membranes (6Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.-M. Watson N. Farquhar M. Malhotra M. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Google Scholar, 7Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.-M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Google Scholar). The latter reagent (p97/yeast Cdc48p) is involved in the assembly of yeast ER fragments (17Latterich M. Frohlich K.-U. R. S. Cell. 1995; 82: 885-893Google Scholar). It would appear that the fusion of mammalian ER microsomes may be mediated by a novel member of the AAA ATPase family. Alternatively, the inactivated factor(s) may remain associated with a docking/fusion complex(es), functioning as a dominant inhibitor.The principle focus of our study was to examine the hypothesis that a Rab GTPase may mediate ER fusion. Previous observations using GTP and/or GTP analogs have implicated the involvement of a GTPase(s) in the homotypic assembly of the mammalian ER membranes (12Watkins J.D. Hermanowski A.L. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5182-5192Google Scholar, 15Dawson A.P. Comerford J.G. Cell Calcium. 1989; 10: 343-350Google Scholar, 16Paiement J. Beaufay H. Godelaine D. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 29-37Google Scholar). We eliminated the possibility that Sar1, ARF1, and Rab1 are involved in ER fusion as trans-dominant inhibitory forms of these proteins, which inhibit ER to Glogi transport, had no effect on ER fusion in vitro. The inability of the GTP-restricted forms of either the Sar1 or ARF1 GTPases to inhibit fusion eliminates the possibility that the inhibition observed with GTPγS is somehow related to the activation of endogenous Sar1 or ARF1 leading to the stable coating of ER membranes with either COPII or COPI coats, respectively (30Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Google Scholar, 32Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Google Scholar,43Orci L.

However, we did find that Rab-GDI, but not Rho-GDI, had potent effects on homotypic fusion and that this inhibition was specific, because GDI mutants defective in Rab binding were"
https://openalex.org/W1977446264,"Overexpression of neu (also known as c-erbB-2 or HER-2) commonly occurs in human cancer and is also known to enchance tumor metastasis and chemoresistance. Our earlier reports showed that the adenovirus 5 E1A can suppresss the neu-mediated transformation by repression of neu. Thus, E1A has the potential to be used as a therapeutic agent against the neu-overexpressing human cancers. However, a serious concern to this approach is that E1A is also capable of immortalizing primary culture cells and can co-operate with ras or E1B oncogenes to transform them. The E1A CR2 domain (amino acid residues 120 to 140) necessary for binding to RB is believed to be required for this oncogenic function. Here, we report that deletion of CR2 region did not affect E1A's capability to repress neu. Interestingly, deletion of the amino acid residues 4 to 25 or 40 to 80 completely disrupted E1A-mediated neu repression. By deleting the amino acid residues from 81 to 185, we have successfully generated a mini-E1A mutant that was sufficient to inhibit neu promoter activity and suppress neu-mediated transformation. The mini-E1A mutant does not contain the CR2 domain that is crucial for RB binding and immortalization, and hence, may serve as a more selective tumor suppressor, and a safer therapeutic agent. It may also be a useful tool to further investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of neu overexpression and E1A-mediated transcriptional repression in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2334135107,"Protein tyrosine phosphorylation accompanies the integrin-mediated cell to substratum adhesion, and is essential for the progression of G1/S phase of the cell-cycle in normal fibroblasts. To examine how cellular protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity is involved in regulating the adhesion-dependent protein tyrosine phosphorylation, we employed fibroblast cells bearing an active form of a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), v-Src. We found that the v-Src induced tyrosine phosphorylation in certain proteins such as tensin, talin, p120, p80/85 (cortactin) and paxillin was greatly reduced when the cell to substratum adhesion was lost. Readhesion of the cells onto fibronectin restored these phosphorylation events, while this was inhibited by the addition of RGD peptide. The kinase activity of the v-Src was unchanged by the loss of cell to substratum adhesion. On the other hand, treatment with a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate caused much the same increase in the v-Src-mediated cellular tyrosine phosphorylation between cells adhered to the culture environments and cells kept in suspension. These data suggest that PTPase(s) appears to be more critical than the v-Src PTK in determining the cell adhesion-dependent protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, most of the protein tyrosine phosphorylations that are mediated by the v-Src but still dependent on the cell adhesion were indeed greatly reduced during an anchorage-independent growth of v-Src cells. Thus our data collectively indicate that the v-Src induced high level of tyrosine phosphorylation in certain types of proteins are still under the control of the integrin(s) or the cell adhesion to culture substratum, and most of these adhesion-regulated high levels of tyrosine phosphorylations are not essential for the transformed phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2320068547,"The Dbl oncogene is the putative exchange factor for two small GTP-binding proteins, RhoA and CDC42 which are involved in the polymerization of actin to produce stress fibers and filopodia, respectively. We report here that Dbl oncogene-transformed NIH3T3 cells show actin stress fibers only when cells are plated on fibronectin. Plating of cells on collagen I and IV as well as on poly-D-lysine and gelatin induces polymerization of actin to form filopodia, lamellipodia and membrane ruffles but not stress fibers. The putative collagen receptors, alpha1/beta1 and alpha2/beta1 integrins are expressed at reduced level in Dbl-transformed cells compared to untransformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Nevertheless, adhesion to collagens is not altered. Inhibitory monoclonal antibody to mouse integrin beta1 subunit blocked adhesion of both Dbl-transformed and untransformed NIH3T3 cells, demonstrating that adhesion to collagen I and IV is mediated by the beta1 family of integrins. Dbl product rapidly induces the depolymerization of actin stress fibers, rounding up of the cells, and formation of filopodia and lamellipodia when microinjected in NIH3T3 cells plated on gelatin. Thus, Dbl may exert its effect on actin cytoskeleton organization in response to extracellular proteins by altering integrin-mediated signalling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2324222738,"LIM-kinase 1 and 2 (LIMK1 and LIMK2) are members of a novel class of protein kinases with structures composed of two LIM motifs at the N-terminus and an unusual protein kinase domain at the C-terminus. The cellular functions of the LIMK family proteins have remained unknown. In the present study, we examined effects of LIMKs on neuronal differentiation of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Transient expression analyses revealed that LIMK1, in itself, had no apparent effect on PC12 cells, but the oncogenic Ras-induced differentiation of PC12 cells was notably inhibited by co-expression with LIMK1 or LIMK2. A mutant of LIMK1 lacking a protein kinase domain (ΔK) similarly inhibited Ras-induced differentiation of PC12 cells, but a mutant lacking a LIM domain (ΔLIM) failed to do so, indicating that a LIM domain but not a protein kinase domain is required for the inhibitory activity. This notion was further supported by the finding that mutation, changing conserved cysteines involved in zinc coordination to glycines in both of two LIM motifs, abolished the inhibitory activity of ΔK. Additionally, we also found that the constitutively activated MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK)-induced differentiation of PC12 cells was inhibited by co-expression with ΔK. Furthermore, ΔK did not inhibit the kinase activity of MAP kinase (MAPK) stimulated by MAPKK, when co-expressed in COS7 cells. These findings suggest that LIMK1 inhibits neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, through its LIM domain and by interfering with events downstream of MAPK activation."
