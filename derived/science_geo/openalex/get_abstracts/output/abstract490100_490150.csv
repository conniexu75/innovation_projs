https://openalex.org/W1976472776,"Uncontrolled transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling promotes aggressive metastatic properties in late-stage breast cancers. However, how TGFβ-mediated cues are directed to induce tumorigenic events is poorly understood, particularly given that TGFβ has clear tumor suppressing activity in other contexts. Here, we demonstrate that the transcriptional regulators TAZ and YAP (TAZ/YAP), key effectors of the Hippo pathway, are necessary to promote and maintain TGFβ-induced tumorigenic phenotypes in breast cancer cells. Interactions between TAZ/YAP, TGFβ-activated SMAD2/3, and TEAD transcription factors reveal convergent roles for these factors in the nucleus. Genome-wide expression analyses indicate that TAZ/YAP, TEADs, and TGFβ-induced signals coordinate a specific pro-tumorigenic transcriptional program. Importantly, genes cooperatively regulated by TAZ/YAP, TEAD, and TGFβ, such as the novel targets NEGR1 and UCA1, are necessary for maintaining tumorigenic activity in metastatic breast cancer cells. Nuclear TAZ/YAP also cooperate with TGFβ signaling to promote phenotypic and transcriptional changes in nontumorigenic cells to overcome TGFβ-repressive effects. Our work thus identifies cross-talk between nuclear TAZ/YAP and TGFβ signaling in breast cancer cells, revealing novel insight into late-stage disease-driving mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2144976262,"The accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes stress to which an unfolded protein response is activated to render cell survival or apoptosis (chronic stress). Transcriptional and translational reprogramming is tightly regulated during the unfolded protein response to ensure specific gene expression. The master regulator of this response is the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 signaling where eIF2α is phosphorylated (eIF2α-P) by the kinase PERK. This signal leads to global translational shutdown, but it also enables translation of the transcription factor ATF4 mRNA. We showed recently that ATF4 induces an anabolic program through the up-regulation of selected amino acid transporters and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Paradoxically, this anabolic program led cells to apoptosis during chronic ER stress in a manner that involved recovery from stress-induced protein synthesis inhibition. By using eIF2α-P-deficient cells as an experimental system, we identified a communicating network of signaling pathways that contribute to the inhibition of protein synthesis during chronic ER stress. This eIF2α-P-independent network includes (i) inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin kinase protein complex 1 (mTORC1)-targeted protein phosphorylation, (ii) inhibited translation of a selective group of 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNAs (encoding proteins involved in the translation machinery and translationally controlled by mTORC1 signaling), and (iii) inhibited translation of non-5′-terminal oligopyrimidine ribosomal protein mRNAs and ribosomal RNA biogenesis. We propose that the PERK/eIF2α-P/ATF4 signaling acts as a brake in the decline of protein synthesis during chronic ER stress by positively regulating signaling downstream of the mTORC1 activity. These studies advance our knowledge on the complexity of the communicating signaling pathways in controlling protein synthesis rates during chronic stress.

Protein synthesis is an energy-expensive molecular process that requires careful regulation. Nutrient availability is closely linked to the rates of protein synthesis (1.Ron D. Harding H.P.

Guan K.L. Amino acid signalling upstream of mTOR.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that mTORC1 activity is important for the translation of a population of mRNAs that contain a 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) tract (10.Thoreen C.C. Chantranupong L. Keys H.R. Wang T. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. A unifying model for mTORC1-mediated regulation of mRNA translation.Nature. 2012; 485: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The majority of TOP mRNAs encode ribosomal proteins and translation factors (11.Mahoney S.J. Dempsey J.M. Blenis J. Cell signaling in protein synthesis ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation and elongation.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2009; 90: 53-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, active mTORC1 phosphorylates multiple proteins by which global protein synthesis rates are positively regulated. One of the mTORC1-targeted proteins is p70 S6 kinase (S6K), a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 and eIF4B as well as proteins involved in the assembly of the translation initiation complex (12.Jastrzebski K. Hannan K.M. Tchoubrieva E.B. Hannan R.D. Pearson R.B. Coordinate regulation of ribosome biogenesis and function by the ribosomal protein S6 kinase, a key mediator of mTOR function.Growth Factors. 2007; 25: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). mTORC1 also positively regulates translation elongation via the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, thus preventing the inhibitory phosphorylation of eEF2 (13.Browne G.J.

An additional positive effect of mTORC1 has been described for rRNA transcription and processing (14.Mayer C. Zhao J. Yuan X.

Russell R.C. Guan K.L. Amino acid signalling upstream of mTOR.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Conversely, mTORC1 signaling inhibits catabolic processes such as autophagy, a survival mechanism used when cells respond to nutrient starvation (9.Jewell J.L. Russell R.C. Guan K.L. Amino acid signalling upstream of mTOR.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In agreement with all these findings, a short duration treatment with Torin 1, a catalytic inhibitor of mTORC1, caused a significant decrease in global protein synthesis rates in mouse embryotic fibroblasts (MEFs) (10.Thoreen C.C. Chantranupong L. Keys H.R. Wang T. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. A unifying model for mTORC1-mediated regulation of mRNA translation.Nature. 2012; 485: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Another intracellular sensor of nutrient availability is the phosphorylation of eIF2α (eIF2α-P) by stress-activated eIF2α kinases (GCN2, PKR, PERK, and HRI). eIF2α-P causes decreased availability of ternary complexes (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi) and inhibits global translation initiation rates (16.Sonenberg N.

However, some mRNAs are preferentially translated via alternative mechanisms of translation initiation (18.Palam L.R. Baird T.D. Wek R.C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Specifically, mRNAs that contain upstream open reading frames, among which is the mRNA encoding the transcription factor ATF4, are translated better under conditions of limited ternary complex availability. ATF4 induces transcriptional reprogramming in nutritionally stressed cells and has a profound impact on cell metabolism (17.Baird T.D. Wek R.C. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phosphorylation and translational control in metabolism.Adv. Nutr. 2012; 3: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In response to diverse stress conditions, this ATF4-mediated transcription program is triggered from the phosphorylation of eIF2α at residue Ser51 by the stress-activated eIF2α kinases. This cellular adaptation to stress is known as the integrated stress response (ISR) program (25.Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F.

Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress involves mechanisms similar to nutritional stress caused by amino acid starvation (26.Krokowski D. Han J. Saikia M. Majumder M. Yuan C.L. Guan B.J. Bevilacqua E. Bussolati O. Bröer S. Arvan P. Tchórzewski M. Snider M.D. Puchowicz M. Croniger C.M. Kimball S.R. Pan T. Koromilas A.E. Kaufman R.J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 17202-17213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although ER stress is the result of the accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the ER and amino acid starvation induces the accumulation of some deacylated tRNAs, both stresses activate specific kinases that phosphorylate eIF2α, inhibit protein synthesis, and initiate the ISR program (27.Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). We showed previously that during ER stress ATF4 induced the expression of genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, amino acid transporters, and proteins involved in the machinery of protein synthesis (26.Krokowski D. Han J. Saikia M. Majumder M. Yuan C.L. Guan B.J. Bevilacqua E. Bussolati O. Bröer S. Arvan P. Tchórzewski M. Snider M.D. Puchowicz M. Croniger C.M. Kimball S.R. Pan T. Koromilas A.E. Kaufman R.J.

Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ATF4 also increased aminoacylation of tRNAs for amino acids, which are substrates for amino acid transport systems among which are system A (SNAT2/Slc38a2) and the heterodimeric system L (Lat1/Slc7a5 and Slc3a2) (26.Krokowski D. Han J. Saikia M. Majumder M. Yuan C.L. Guan B.J. Bevilacqua E. Bussolati O. Bröer S. Arvan P. Tchórzewski M. Snider M.D. Puchowicz M. Croniger C.M. Kimball S.R. Pan T. Koromilas A.E. Kaufman R.J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 17202-17213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). System A mediates the transport of small neutral amino acids, and system L mediates the transport of branched-chain (Leu, Ile, and Val) and aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, and Trp) (29.Hyde R. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Amino acid transporters: roles in amino acid sensing and signalling in animal cells.Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 30.Hundal H.S.

Metab. 2009; 296: E603-E613Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We demonstrated in pancreatic β cells that ER stress increased the flux of amino acids by the coordinated induction of a network of transporters, contributing in parallel to other known mechanisms to translational recovery from the stress-induced inhibition of protein synthesis (26.Krokowski D. Han J. Saikia M. Majumder M. Yuan C.L. Guan B.J. Bevilacqua E. Bussolati O. Bröer S. Arvan P. Tchórzewski M. Snider M.D. Puchowicz M. Croniger C.M. Kimball S.R. Pan T. Koromilas A.E. Kaufman R.J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 17202-17213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, increased system L activity can lead to increased intracellular levels of Leu, which along with other factors becomes a nutrient sensing mechanism that activates mTORC1 on lysosomal membranes (31.Han J.M. Jeong S.J. Park M.C. Kim G. Kwon N.H. Kim H.K. Ha S.H. Ryu S.H. Kim S.

A tumor suppressor complex with GAP activity for the Rag GTPases that signal amino acid sufficiency to mTORC1.Science. 2013; 340: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). This mechanism of mTORC1 activation also involves the signaling adaptor protein p62, which is targeted for degradation by the autophagic pathway (33.Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Feedback on fat: p62-mTORC1-autophagy connections.Cell. 2011; 147: 724-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The effect of the ER stress-induced eIF2α-P/ATF4 axis on mTORC1 activity has not been clearly established. Recent reports showed that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, a negative regulator of mTORC1, was correlated with decreased mTORC1 activity during prolonged ER stress (34.Qin L. Wang Z. Tao L. Wang Y. ER stress negatively regulates AKT/TSC/mTOR pathway to enhance autophagy.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 35.Preston A.M. Hendershot L.M. Examination of a second node of translational control in the unfolded protein response.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 4253-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the ATF4-induced amino acid transporter network contributes to protein synthesis rates during chronic ER stress by increasing mTORC1 activity. We also hypothesized that the cross-talk between the ISR and mTORC1 signaling pathways during ER stress contributes synergistically to the reprogramming of global protein synthesis rates and selective mRNA translation. To test this hypothesis, we used MEFs deficient in eIF2α-P (S51A mutation; A/A cells). These cells do not have the immediate shutdown of protein synthesis during acute ER stress and do not induce ATF4 expression (36.Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Translational control is required for the unfolded protein response and in vivo glucose homeostasis.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). However, the response of eIF2α-P-deficient cells to prolonged stress has not yet been reported. We now show that ER stress induces a gradual decrease of protein synthesis in A/A cells with a good correlation to mTORC1 inactivation. Ectopic expression of ATF4 in A/A cells increased global translation rates and amino acid uptake and partially restored mTORC1 activity during ER stress. The contribution of amino acid transporters in the induction of mTORC1 activity was also demonstrated in pancreatic β cells. We previously studied extensively the ATF4-mediated amino acid transporter network in mouse insulinoma cell line 6 (MIN6) in response to ER stress (26.Krokowski D. Han J. Saikia M. Majumder M. Yuan C.L. Guan B.J. Bevilacqua E. Bussolati O. Bröer S. Arvan P. Tchórzewski M. Snider M.D. Puchowicz M. Croniger C.M. Kimball S.R. Pan T. Koromilas A.E. Kaufman R.J. Hatzoglou M.

Chem. 2013; 288: 17202-17213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that inhibition of amino acid transporters negatively regulates mTORC1 activity during ER stress. Taken together, our studies reveal a cross-talk between the ATF4 transcription program and the mTORC1 signaling that contributes to the regulation of mRNA translation during prolonged ER stress. The identification of the network of amino acid transporters in this cross-communication of signaling pathways can lead to therapeutic strategies that can attenuate increasing protein synthesis rates during chronic stress. As we showed earlier, control of bulk protein synthesis rates during chronic ER stress is important for cell survival (26.Krokowski D. Han J. Saikia M. Majumder M. Yuan C.L. Guan B.J. Bevilacqua E.

The studies reported here contribute to an increased understanding of the mechanisms that control bulk protein synthesis rates during chronic ER stress. MEFs including S/S, A/A, ATG5+/+, and ATG5−/− were grown in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% defined FBS (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. S/S and A/A MEFs were described previously (36.Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J.

MIN6 was maintained in the same medium as for MEFs plus 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and only passages 30–42 were cultured for analysis. All cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for all experiments. Adenoviral particles expressing ATF4, β-gal, and shRNA against ATF4 (Vector BioLabs) were propagated in HEK293T cells. For the experiments of ATF4 overexpression in A/A MEFs, cells were infected with adenoviral particles for 24 h followed by the indicated treatments. For the experiments using shRNA for ATF4, cells were infected with adenoviral particles for 72 h followed by the indicated treatments. ER stress was induced with 400 nm thapsigargin (Sigma). Inhibition of glycosylation was treated with 3 μm tunicamycin (Sigma). 2-Aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid and α-methyl-dl-tryptophan were from Sigma-Aldrich. Torin 1 was purchased from Tocris. Amino acid uptake was measured by the corresponding isotope-labeled amino acid as described previously (26.Krokowski D. Han J. Saikia M. Majumder M. Yuan C.L.

Briefly, cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well, grown for 24 h, and subjected to treatment as described. Cells were washed twice with Earle's balanced salt solution at 37 °C, and assays were performed in Earle's balanced salt solution or Earle's balanced salt solution with NaCl replaced by choline chloride as follows: (i) system A activity: 0.1 mm [14C]methylaminoisobutyrate (MeAIB; 4 μCi/ml) for 2 min; (ii) Leu uptake by system L: 0.01 mm [3H]Leu (2 μCi/ml) for 1 min; (iii) Arg uptake by system y+: 0.1 mm [3H]Arg (8 μCi/ml) for 30 s in the presence of 2 mm Leu, which prevents uptake through system y+L; and (iv) 0.05 mm [3H]Gln (5 μCi/ml). Amino acids were extracted in ethanol and measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Cells were lysed in 1 n NaOH and 1% sodium deoxycholate. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowery method using BSA as a standard. All radiochemicals were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. To measure the concentration of free intracellular amino acids, cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and grown to 70% confluence (3.0–4.0 × 106 cells). Control and treated cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and free amino acids were extracted by 5% acetic acid in ethanol for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to tubes, dried under vacuum, and dissolved in 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 9.5). The remaining cells were lysed in 1 n NaOH and 1% sodium deoxycholate, and the protein concentration was determined by the Lowery method with BSA as a standard. Amino acids were derivatized and analyzed on an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-UV MassTrak Amino Acid Analysis instrument (Waters) following the manufacturer's instructions at the University Hospital of Cleveland, Laboratory Core. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well, grown for 24 h, and subjected to treatment as described (38.Bevilacqua E. Wang X. Majumder M. Gaccioli F. Yuan C.L. Wang C. Zhu X.

Briefly, cells were incubated for 10 min in Met/Cys-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS in the presence of the treatment reagents. [35S]Met/Cys was added (30 μCi/ml Expre35S35S Protein Labeling Mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for an additional 30 min. Cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS, and total proteins were precipitated three times with 5% TCA and 1 mm Met for 10 min on ice. Precipitates were dissolved in 200 μl of 1 n NaOH and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate for 1 h. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Total cellular proteins were quantified by the DCTM Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instruction. Incorporation of [35S]Met/Cys into total cellular proteins was calculated and normalized. Cells were seeded in 150-mm culture dishes and grown to 70% confluence (∼1.0 × 107 cells). Following the indicated treatments, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to cells for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, scraped, and pelleted at 4,000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellets were suspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mm DTT, 200 unit/ml RNase inhibitor (RNaseOUT, Invitrogen), EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)), kept on ice for 20 min, and then passed 15 times through a 23-gauge needle.

Intravascular spectroscopic and molecular photoacoustic imaging can potentially improve the identification of atherosclerotic plaque composition, the detection of inflammation, and ultimately the risk stratification of atherosclerosis. In this study, a first-of-its-kind intravascular optical-resolution photoacoustic tomography (OR-PAT) system with a 1.1 mm diameter catheter is developed, offering optical-diffraction limited transverse resolution as fine as 19.6 μm, ∼10-fold finer than that of conventional intravascular photoacoustic and ultrasonic imaging. To offer complementary imaging information and depth, the system also acquires co-registered intravascular ultrasound images in parallel. Imaging of an iliac stent and a lipid phantom shows that the high resolution and contrast of OR-PAT can enable improved stent implantation guidance and lipid identification. In the future, these capabilities may ultimately improve the diagnosis and interventional treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, which are prone to cause thrombotic complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke."

Common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., a major protein source in developing countries, is highly affected by soil salinity and the information on genes that play a role in salt tolerance is scarce. We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and related pathways by comprehensive analysis of transcriptomes of both root and leaf tissues of the tolerant genotype grown under saline and control conditions in hydroponic system. We have generated a total of 158 million high-quality reads which were assembled into 83,774 all-unigenes with a mean length of 813 bp and N50 of 1,449 bp. Among the all-unigenes, 58,171 were assigned with Nr annotations after homology analyses. It was revealed that 6,422 and 4,555 all-unigenes were differentially expressed upon salt stress in leaf and root tissues respectively. Validation of the RNA-seq quantifications (RPKM values) was performed by qRT-PCR (Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR) analyses. Enrichment analyses of DEGs based on GO and KEGG databases have shown that both leaf and root tissues regulate energy metabolism, transmembrane transport activity, and secondary metabolites to cope with salinity. A total of 2,678 putative common bean transcription factors were identified and classified under 59 transcription factor families; among them 441 were salt responsive. The data generated in this study will help in understanding the fundamentals of salt tolerance in common bean and will provide resources for functional genomic studies."

In several studies comparing gender dysphoric youth, who are likely to be homosexual in adulthood, to clinical or non-clinical control groups, the findings have been consistent with the fraternal birth order effect in males; however, less is known about unique sibship characteristics of gender dysphoric females. The current study investigated birth order and sibling sex ratio in a large sample of children and adolescents referred to the same Gender Identity Service (N = 768). Probands were classified as heterosexual males, homosexual males, or homosexual females based on clinical diagnostic information. Groups differed significantly in age and sibship size, and homosexual females were significantly more likely to be only children. Subsequent analyses controlled for age and for sibship size. Compared to heterosexual males, homosexual males had a significant preponderance of older brothers and homosexual females had a significant preponderance of older sisters. Similarly, the older sibling sex ratio of homosexual males showed a significant excess of brothers whereas that of homosexual females showed a significant excess of sisters. Like previous studies of gender dysphoric youth and adults, these findings were consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. In addition, the greater frequency of only children and elevated numbers of older sisters among the homosexual female group adds to a small literature on sibship characteristics of potential relevance to the development of gender identity and sexual orientation in females."

Here, we combined data from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and antibody-based immunohistochemistry across all major human tissues to explore the human liver proteome with enriched expression, as well as the cell type-enriched expression in hepatocyte and bile duct cells. We identified in total 477 protein-coding genes with elevated expression in the liver: 179 genes have higher expression as compared to all the other analyzed tissues; 164 genes have elevated transcript levels in the liver shared with at least one other tissue type; and an additional 134 genes have a mild level of increased expression in the liver. We identified the precise localization of these proteins through antibody-based protein profiling and the subcellular localization of these proteins through immunofluorescent-based profiling. We also identified the biological processes and metabolic functions associated with these proteins, investigated their contribution in the occurrence of liver diseases, and identified potential targets for their treatment.

https://openalex.org/W1997270477,"Background & Aims Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become an important public concern due to its increasing prevalence. An altered fatty acid composition has been associated with MetS, but the Mediterranean diet has been shown to have a protective effect. The aim of the present study was to analyze the influence of a Mediterranean dietary pattern, as assessed by the biomarkers of food supplied, on the plasma fatty acid composition and its relation with MetS after 1 year of intervention. Methods A total of 424 subjects were randomly selected from the PREDIMED randomized dietary trial after completing a 1-year intervention program. Participants aged 55 to 80 years and at high risk of cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to three dietary interventions: Mediterranean diet supplemented with virgin olive oil or nuts, or a low-fat diet. Results After 1 year of intervention participants in the virgin olive oil group showed significantly increased plasma concentrations of palmitic and oleic acids, but reduced proportions of margaric, stearic, and linoleic acids. In turn, subjects in the nut group showed significantly increased levels of palmitic, linoleic, and α-linolenic acids, but reduced proportions of myristic, margaric, palmitoleic, and dihommo-γ-linoleic acids. Increases in the biomarkers of foods supplied to the Mediterranean diet groups, i.e., oleic and α-linolenic acids, were beneficially associated with the incidence, reversion and prevalence of MetS. No weight changes were observed among participants. Conclusions The nut and olive oil diets induced a fatty acid composition that has been shown to be beneficial in the face of MetS. Therefore, a Mediterranean diet rich in fats of vegetable origin may be a useful tool for the management of MetS without the need for concerns over weight gain due to its high fat content.

https://openalex.org/W2064185874,"Background Dyslipidemia and lipotoxicity-induced insulin resistance, inflammation and oxidative stress are the key pathogeneses of renal damage in type 2 diabetes. Increasing evidence shows that whole-body low dose radiation (LDR) plays a critical role in attenuating insulin resistance, inflammation and oxidative stress. Objective The aims of the present study were to investigate whether LDR can prevent type 2 diabetes-induced renal damage and the underlying mechanisms. Methods Mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD, 40% of calories from fat) for 12 weeks to induce obesity followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg) to develop a type 2 diabetic mouse model. The mice were exposed to LDR at different doses (25, 50 and 75 mGy) for 4 or 8 weeks along with HFD treatment. At each time-point, the kidney weight, renal function, blood glucose level and insulin resistance were examined. The pathological changes, renal lipid profiles, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis were also measured. Results HFD/STZ-induced type 2 diabetic mice exhibited severe pathological changes in the kidney and renal dysfunction. Exposure of the mice to LDR for 4 weeks, especially at 50 and 75 mGy, significantly improved lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity and protein kinase B activation, meanwhile, attenuated inflammation and oxidative stress in the diabetic kidney. The LDR-induced anti-oxidative effect was associated with up-regulation of renal nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) expression and function. However, the above beneficial effects were weakened once LDR treatment was extended to 8 weeks. Conclusion These results suggest that LDR exposure significantly prevented type 2 diabetes-induced kidney injury characterized by renal dysfunction and pathological changes. The protective mechanisms of LDR are complicated but may be mainly attributed to the attenuation of dyslipidemia and the subsequent lipotoxicity-induced insulin resistance, inflammation and oxidative stress."

Both men and women were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing facial photographs. In addition to general intelligence, figural and fluid intelligence showed a significant relationship with perceived intelligence, but again, only in men. No relationship between perceived intelligence and IQ was found for women. We used geometric morphometrics to determine which facial traits are associated with the perception of intelligence, as well as with intelligence as measured by IQ testing. Faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. By contrast, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin. By contrast, we found no correlation between morphological traits and real intelligence measured with IQ test, either in men or women.These results suggest that a perceiver can accurately gauge the real intelligence of men, but not women, by viewing their faces in photographs; however, this estimation is possibly not based on facial shape. Our study revealed no relation between intelligence and either attractiveness or face shape."

Several molecules work as cofactors in the conversion process, including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs exhibit a paradoxical effect, as they convert PrP into protease-resistant PrP (PrP-res) but also exert protective activity. We compared the stability and aggregation propensity of PrP and the heparin-PrP complex through the application of different in vitro aggregation approaches, including real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy–associated forms from mouse and hamster brain homogenates were used to seed RT-QuIC-induced fibrillization. In our study, interaction between heparin and cellular PrP (PrPC) increased thermal PrP stability, leading to an 8-fold decrease in temperature-induced aggregation. The interaction of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWHep) with the PrP N- or C-terminal domain affected not only the extent of PrP fibrillization but also its kinetics, lowering the reaction rate constant from 1.04 to 0.29 s–1 and increasing the lag phase from 12 to 19 h in RT-QuIC experiments. Our findings explain the protective effect of heparin in different models of prion and prion-like neurodegenerative diseases and establish the groundwork for the development of therapeutic strategies based on GAGs.—Vieira, T.

In the study, Hakason index, Nemerow index (P), the hazard index (HI) and the cancer risk index (RI) were calculated to assess the potential risk. The sequence of potential ecological risk based on Hakason index was arsenic (As) > cadmium (Cd) > lead (Pb) > copper (Cu) > chromium (Cr), in particular, As and Cd were regarded as high polluted metals. While the results of extraction of TCLP were assessed using P, the sequence was As > Pb > Cd > Cr > Cu, which mean that As and Pb should be low polluted, and Cd, Cr and Cu would barely not polluted. For human health, total carcinogenic risk for children and adults was 2.01×10−3 and 1.05×10−3, respectively. This could be considered to be intolerable in urban street dust exposure. The sequence in the hazard quotient (HQ) of each element was As > Cr > Pb > Cu > Cd. The HI value of these toxic metals in urban street dust for children and adults was 5.88×10−1 and 2.80×10−1, respectively.

Under basal conditions, Cav-1 binds eNOS and inhibits nitric oxide (NO) production via the Cav-1 scaffolding domain (CAV; amino acids 82–101).

https://openalex.org/W2055727332,"O-GlcNAcylation is an important post-translational modification of proteins and is known to regulate a number of pathways involved in cellular homeostasis. This involves dynamic and reversible modification of serine/threonine residues of different cellular proteins catalyzed by O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and O-linked N-acetylglucosaminidase in an antagonistic manner. We report here that decreasing O-GlcNAcylation enhances the viability of neuronal cells expressing polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin exon 1 protein fragment (mHtt). We further show that O-GlcNAcylation regulates the basal autophagic process and that suppression of O-GlcNAcylation significantly increases autophagic flux by enhancing the fusion of autophagosome with lysosome. This regulation considerably reduces toxic mHtt aggregates in eye imaginal discs and partially restores rhabdomere morphology and vision in a fly model for Huntington disease. This study is significant in unraveling O-GlcNAcylation-dependent regulation of an autophagic process in mediating mHtt toxicity.

https://openalex.org/W2027209297,"Nitrogen is one of the key nutrients for microbial growth. During infection, pathogenic fungi like C. albicans need to acquire nitrogen from a broad range of different and changing sources inside the host. Detecting the available nitrogen sources and adjusting the expression of genes for their uptake and degradation is therefore crucial for survival and growth as well as for establishing an infection. Here, we analyzed the transcriptional response of C. albicans to nitrogen starvation and feeding with the infection-relevant nitrogen sources arginine and bovine serum albumin (BSA), representing amino acids and proteins, respectively. The response to nitrogen starvation was marked by an immediate repression of protein synthesis and an up-regulation of general amino acid permeases, as well as an up-regulation of autophagal processes in its later stages. Feeding with arginine led to a fast reduction in expression of general permeases for amino acids and to resumption of protein synthesis. The response to BSA feeding was generally slower, and was additionally characterized by an up-regulation of oligopeptide transporter genes. From time-series data, we inferred network interaction models for genes relevant in nitrogen detection and uptake. Each individual network was found to be largely specific for the experimental condition (starvation or feeding with arginine or BSA). In addition, we detected several novel connections between regulator and effector genes, with putative roles in nitrogen uptake. We conclude that C. albicans adopts a particular nitrogen response network, defined by sets of specific gene-gene connections for each environmental condition. All together, they form a grid of possible gene regulatory networks, increasing the transcriptional flexibility of C. albicans."

Simulation conditions mimic those experienced by the real human tear film during blinks. Namely, thermodynamic equilibrium simulations at different lateral compressions are performed to model varying surface pressure, and the dynamics of the system during a blink is studied by non-equilibrium MD simulations. Polar lipids separate their non-polar counterparts from water by forming a monomolecular layer whereas the non-polar molecules establish a thick outermost lipid layer. Under lateral compression, the polar layer undulates and a sorting of polar lipids occurs. Moreover, formation of three-dimensional aggregates of polar lipids in both non-polar and water subphases is observed. We suggest that these three-dimensional structures are abundant under dynamic conditions caused by the action of eye lids and that they act as reservoirs of polar lipids, thus increasing stability of the tear film."

Oenanthe javanica, an aquatic perennial herb, belongs to the Oenanthe genus in Apiaceae family, with known medicinal properties. In the current study, O. javanica was subjected to hormone stimuli (gibberellin, salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, and abscisic acid) and abiotic stresses (heat, cold, salt, and drought), and the expression of nine candidate reference genes (eIF-4α, ACT7, TIP41, GAPDH, SAND, EF-1α, PP2A, TBP, and TUB) was evaluated. Stability of the genes was assessed using geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. All the genes presented distinct expression profiles under the experimental conditions analyzed. Under abiotic stress conditions, ACT7 and PP2A genes displayed the maximum stability; PP2A and SAND were the most stable genes under hormone stimuli. Even though PP2A gene was most stable across all the samples, individual analysis revealed changes in expression profile. To further validate the suitability of the reference genes identified in this study, the expression level of M6PR gene under salt treatment was studied. Based on our data, we propose that it is essential to normalize the target gene expression with specific reference genes under different experimental conditions for most accurate results.

When applied as a soil drench, BABA significantly reduced weights of S. avenae, whereas foliar spray and seed treatment had no such effects. BABA-mediated suppression of S. avenae growth was dose dependent and lasted at least for 7 days. The aminobutyric acid concentration in phloem sap of BABA-treated plants was higher and increased with BABA concentrations applied. Moreover, after 10 days of treatment, the aminobutyric acid content in BABA-treated plants was still higher than that in control treatment. Sitobion avenae could not discriminate artificial diet containing BABA from standard diet, indicating that BABA itself is not a deterrent to this aphid. Also S. avenae did not show preference for control plants or BABA-treated plants. Consistent with choice test results, S. avenae had similar feeding activities on control and BABA-treated plants, suggesting that BABA did not induce antifeedants in wheat seedlings. In addition, aminobutyric acid concentration in S. avenae feeding on BABA-treated plants was significantly higher than those feeding on control plants. Sitobion avenae growth rate was reduced on the artificial diet containing BABA, indicating that BABA had direct toxic effects on this aphid species. These results suggest that BABA application reduced S. avenae performance on wheat seedlings and the mechanism is possibly due to direct toxicity of high BABA contents in plant phloem."

https://openalex.org/W2152366177,"Aeroallergens such as house dust mite (HDM), cockroach, and grass or tree pollen are innocuous substances that can induce allergic sensitization upon inhalation. The serine proteases present in these allergens are thought to activate the protease-activated receptor (PAR)-2, on the airway epithelium, thereby potentially inducing allergic sensitization at the expense of inhalation tolerance. We hypothesized that the proteolytic activity of allergens may play an important factor in the allergenicity to house dust mite and is essential to overcome airway tolerance. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of PAR-2 activation in allergic sensitization and HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation. In our study, Par-2 deficient mice were treated with two different HDM extracts containing high and low serine protease activities twice a week for a period of 5 weeks. We determined airway inflammation through quantification of percentages of mononuclear cells, eosinophils and neutrophils in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid and measured total IgE and HDM-specific IgE and IgG1 levels in serum. Furthermore, Th2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-5, IL-13, Eotaxin-1, IL-17, KC, Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), were measured in lung tissue homogenates. We observed that independent of the serine protease content, HDM was able to induce elevated levels of eosinophils and neutrophils in the airways of both wild-type (WT) and Par-2 deficient mice. Furthermore, we show that induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by HDM exposure is independent of Par-2 activation. In contrast, serine protease activity of HDM does contribute to enhanced levels of total IgE, but not HDM-specific IgE. We conclude that, while Par-2 activation contributes to the development of IgE responses, it is largely dispensable for the HDM-induced induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and airway inflammation in an experimental mouse model of HDM-driven allergic airway disease."

Group VIA phospholipase A2 (iPLA2β) affects β-cell sensitivity to apoptosis, and here we examined iPLA2β effects on events that occur in β-cells incubated with C16:0. Such events in INS-1 insulinoma cells were found to include activation of caspase-3, expression of stress response genes (C/EBP homologous protein and activating transcription factor 4), accumulation of ceramide, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis. All of these responses were blunted in INS-1 cells that overexpress iPLA2β, which has been proposed to facilitate repair of oxidized mitochondrial phospholipids, e.g. cardiolipin (CL), by excising oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acid residues, e.g. linoleate (C18:2), to yield lysophospholipids, e.g. monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), that can be reacylated to regenerate the native phospholipid structures. Here the MLCL content of mouse pancreatic islets was found to rise with increasing iPLA2β expression, and recombinant iPLA2β hydrolyzed CL to MLCL and released oxygenated C18:2 residues from oxidized CL in preference to native C18:2. C16:0 induced accumulation of oxidized CL species and of the oxidized phospholipid (C18:0/hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid)-glycerophosphoethanolamine, and these effects were blunted in INS-1 cells that overexpress iPLA2β, consistent with iPLA2β-mediated removal of oxidized phospholipids. C16:0 also induced iPLA2β association with INS-1 cell mitochondria, consistent with a role in mitochondrial repair. These findings indicate that iPLA2β confers significant protection of β-cells against C16:0-induced injury."

We evaluated the effectiveness of antenatal clinics (ANC) to deliver two doses of IPTp and ITNs to pregnant women in Segou district, Mali.We used household data to assess the systems effectiveness of ANC to deliver IPTp and ITNs to pregnant women and used logistic regression to identify predictors of ANC attendance, receipt of IPTp and ITN use during pregnancy, and the impact on community effectiveness.Of 81% of recently pregnant women who made at least one ANC visit, 59% of these attended during the eligible gestational age for IPTp. Of these, 82% reported receiving one dose of SP and 91% attended ANC again, of whom 66% received a second dose, resulting in a cumulative effectiveness for 2-dose IPTp of 29%, most of whom used an ITN (90%). Cumulative effectiveness of 2-dose SP by directly observed therapy (DOT) was very low (6%). ITN use was 92%, and ANC was the main source (81%). Reported and ANC-card data showed some doses of SP are given to women in their first trimester. Women were less likely to receive two doses by DOT if they were married (OR 0.10; CI 0.03, 0.40), or lived <5 km from the health facility (OR 0.34; CI 0.14, 0.83). A high household person-LLIN ratio predicted low ITN use in pregnant women (OR 0.16; CI 0.04, 0.55).Our findings suggest poor adherence by health workers to provision of IPTp by eligible gestational age and DOT, contributing to low effectiveness of this strategy in this setting. ITN delivery and use among women was substantially higher. Efforts to improve health worker adherence to IPTp guidelines are needed to improve service delivery of IPTp."

However, the role of the methylation-induced RRAD inactivation in tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, the Ras-regulated transcriptome and epigenome were profiled by comparing T29H (a RasV12-transformed human ovarian epithelial cell line) with T29 (an immortalized but non-transformed cell line) through reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and digital gene expression. We found that RasV12-mediated oncogenic transformation was accompanied by RRAD promoter hypermethylation and a concomitant loss of RRAD expression. In addition, we found that the RRAD promoter was hypermethylated, and its transcription was reduced in ovarian cancer versus normal ovarian tissues. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine resulted in demethylation in the RRAD promoter and restored RRAD expression in T29H cells. Additionally, treatment with farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI277 resulted in restored RRAD expression and inhibited DNA methytransferase expression and activity in T29H cells. By employing knockdown and overexpression techniques in T29 and T29H, respectively, we found that RRAD inhibited glucose uptake and lactate production by repressing the expression of glucose transporters. Finally, RRAD overexpression in T29H cells inhibited tumor formation in nude mice, suggesting that RRAD is a tumor suppressor gene.

Ras, a small 21-kDa GTPase that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation, plays a critical role in cancer initiation and progression. Mutations in genes of the human Ras family (H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras) have been detected in ∼30% of human cancers (1Bos J.L. ras oncogenes in human cancer: a review.Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wittinghofer A. Signal transduction via Ras.Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 933-937PubMed Google Scholar). As a membrane protein, Ras serves as a molecular switch that mediates signal transduction across the membrane. Dysregulation of Ras signaling ultimately leads to oncogenesis (1Bos J.L. ras oncogenes in human cancer: a review.Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shiraha H. Yamamoto K.

Taking advantage of the Ras-T29H ovarian epithelial cell model, Cheng's group also found that the OPCML (opioid-binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like) gene is epigenetically regulated by Ras in oncogenic transformation (11Mei F.C.

RAS-mediated epigenetic inactivation of OPCML in oncogenic transformation of human ovarian surface epithelial cells.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying Ras involvement in oncogenic transformation remain poorly understood. 80 years ago, Otto Warburg proposed that to overcome nutrient limitations for uncontrolled cell proliferation, tumor cells exhibit an altered metabolism characterized by elevated aerobic glycolysis. This hypothesis is supported by the observation of increased glucose uptake in tumor cells (13Vander Heiden M.G. Cantley L.C. Thompson C.B.

Although aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate ATP, the ratios of ATP/ADP and ADH/NAD+ are high in proliferating cells, especially when they are provided with an abundant nutrient supply in the circulating blood (13Vander Heiden M.G.

When tumor cells undergo aerobic glycolysis, glucose is converted to lactate and other intermediates for biosynthesis of fatty acids, nonessential amino acids, and nucleotides (13Vander Heiden M.G.

Rad: a member of the Ras family overexpressed in muscle of type II diabetic humans.Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that the RRAD promoter is hypermethylated in human cancers, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, breast cancer, malignant mesotheliomas, prostate cancer, cervical carcinoma, and lung cancer, and its promoter hypermethylation is associated with reduced RRAD expression in tumor tissues (19Mo Y.

These observations led us to speculate that RRAD may be involved in cancer aerobic glycolysis by regulating glucose uptake. DNA methylation changes are integral to all aspects of cancer genomics and have been shown to have important associations with gene expression (28Weisenberger D.J.

The pCMV-RasV12 plasmid was purchased from Clontech. Plasmid transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RRAD overexpression in stable clones was validated by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. Cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and were cultured in an incubator in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Genomic DNA was extracted using the genomic DNA extraction kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, China). Genomic DNA (750 ng) is used as the starting material and was converted by sodium bisulfite using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). The RRAD promoter region (+5 to −315 upstream of the TSS) was amplified from the modified DNA using Nest1 and Nest2 primers. The primer sequences are as follows: Nest1, 5′-GGGGTTTTAGGGTGTGTTGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AATTCTTCTCCAAAAAACAATTAC-3′ (antisense); Nest2, 5′-GTATTGGGTTTTGGTTTTAGAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACTTTTAACTAATTAAATTTACCCC-3′ (antisense).

The Nest2 PCR was performed in a total volume of 35 μl containing 4.5 μl of the 10-fold diluted Nest1 PCR product under the same PCR conditions for 36 cycles. The PCR product was gel-purified, ligated into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI), sequenced, and analyzed with the PUMA software program. 42 ovarian tumors and 10 normal tissues were collected from subjects who underwent surgery in The General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army (Beijing, China). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The protocol was approved by the Scientific Ethics Committees of The General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army. All ovarian tumors and control tissues were confirmed by the hospital's clinical pathology department. The classification and features of the ovarian tissues were as listed in Tables 1 and 2.

T29H cells were placed in a 10-cm plate, incubated to 50% confluence, and then treated with 5-aza-dC. Growth medium was changed every 24 h. Cells were harvested after 4 days for RNA and DNA extraction, which was carried out using the TIANGEN kit (Beijing, China). The extracted RNA and DNA were then used for RRAD expression and promoter methylation analysis, respectively. Differences were analyzed by the paired t test using SPSS version 17.0 software. All samples were normalized to β-actin. T29 or T29H cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2.5 × 105 cells/well 1 h before transfection with siRNA and siPORTTM NeoFXTM agent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were collected 72 h later. The small interfering RNAs siRRAD and the negative control siCONT were obtained from Invitrogen. HRasV12 siRNAs were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD) for 30 min. The DNA-free RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI). A sample prepared in the absence of reverse transcriptase served as a negative control. SYBR Green real-time PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM 7300 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Differences between samples were analyzed by independent sample t test using SPSS version 17.0 software. All samples were normalized to β-actin.

Lysates (80 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-RRAD antibody (Sigma). β-Actin was used as the loading control. The nuclear extracts were prepared using the Nuclear Extraction kit (Epigentek), and then aliquotted and stored at −80 °C until the assay was performed. DNMT activity was measured using the DNMT Activity/Inhibition Assay Ultra kit (Epigentek), as described previously (30Gao F. Liu X. Wu X.P. Wang X.L. Gong D. Lu H. Xia Y. Song Y. Wang J. Du J. Liu S.

Briefly, 5-μg nuclear extracts for each assay were used as the start material, and the procedure was according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glucose uptake was determined as the accumulation of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Briefly, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated with insulin at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed twice again with PBS and incubated with 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (200 μm in PBS, 1 μCi/well) at 37 °C for 15 min. Cytochalasin B was used as a negative control. The reaction was terminated with three rapid washes in ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed with 1% SDS and prepared for scintillation counting (MicroBeta-1450, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Differences between samples were analyzed by independent sample Student's t test using SPSS version 17.0 software. Lactate was quantified as described previously (32Marbach E.P. Weil M.H. Rapid enzymatic measurement of blood lactate and pyruvate: use and significance of metaphosphoric acid as a common precipitant.Clin. Chem. 1967; 13: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight cultures were harvested and resuspended in phosphate buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and sonicated to disrupt the cells. The cell debris was removed, and serial dilutions of the suspension were assayed for lactate, using the lactate assay kit from BioVision (Milpitas, CA). Lactate production was normalized to cell number. Differences between samples were analyzed by independent sample t test using SPSS version 17.0 software. RRBS libraries were constructed for T29 and T29H cell lines, as described previously (33Gu H. Bock C. Mikkelsen T.S. Jäger N. Smith Z.D. Tomazou E. Gnirke A. Lander E.S. Meissner A. Genome-scale DNA methylation mapping of clinical samples at single-nucleotide resolution.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 ng of genomic DNA was digested with 20 units of MspI (New England Biolabs) in a 20-μl reaction for 20 h at 37 °C. After purification, the digested products were blunt-ended, and then dA was added, followed by methylated adapter (Illumina) ligation. To obtain DNA fractions in the 40–120 and 120–220 bp range of MspI-digested products, two ranges (160–240 and 240–340 bp) of adapter-ligated fractions were excised from 2% agarose gel. The size-selected DNA was bisulfite-treated for two rounds using the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer's standard protocol. The final libraries were generated by amplification with HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Boston, MA), and Illumina Multiplexing PCR Primers. The quality and quantity of RRBS libraries were analyzed by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and RT-PCR, respectively. Finally, Illumina HiSeq 2000 was used to sequence the libraries according to the manufacturer's protocol. For sequencing reads produced by HiSeq 2000, the low quality reads and adapter sequences were first removed from the raw reads. The quality of resulted clean reads was checked by FastQC (available on the World Wide Web). All bisulfite-treated short reads and human reference genome sequence were then converted to three-letter alphabet. The software SOAP2 (34Li R. Li Y. Kristiansen K. Wang J. SOAP: short oligonucleotide alignment program.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 713-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar) was used for the alignment of the transformed reads to the transformed reference genome sequence with two mismatches allowed in the seed (40 bp) (35Li Y. Zhu J. Tian G. Li N. Li Q. Ye M. Zheng H. Yu J. Wu H. Sun J. Zhang H. Chen Q. Luo R. Chen M. He Y. Jin X. Zhang Q. Yu C. Zhou G. Sun J. Huang Y. Zheng H. Cao H. Zhou X. Guo S. Hu X. Li X.

The DNA methylome of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000533Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To identify the position of methylcytosines and the methylation pattern of each methylcytosine, BSMAP was used to process the alignment results to identify the methylcytosines where at least three reads were covered. The detailed annotation of methylcytosines was performed using RRBS-Analyzer software (36Wang T. Liu Q. Li X. Wang X. Li J. Zhu X. Sun Z.S. Wu J. RRBS-Analyser: a comprehensive web server for reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data analysis.Hum. Mutat. 2013; 34: 1606-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cytosine methylation pattern in CpG islands across T29 and T29H sequences was determined from the mapping reads of each sample. Based on the CpG methylation pattern, the differential methylation regions (DMRs) were then identified by RRBS-Analyzer (supplemental Table S1). Two biological replicates were carried out for each cell line, and about 3.50- and 4.40-Gb 100-bp paired-end data were generated for T29 and T29H in each replicate, respectively, of which about 80% can be uniquely mapped to the human genome (supplemental Table S2). The efficiency of bisulfite treatment was evaluated by calculating the C to T conversion rate for all cytosines in the C"
https://openalex.org/W2120256958,"Argos recently implemented a new algorithm to calculate locations of satellite-tracked animals that uses a Kalman filter (KF). The KF algorithm is reported to increase the number and accuracy of estimated positions over the traditional Least Squares (LS) algorithm, with potential advantages to the application of state-space methods to model animal movement data. We tested the performance of two Bayesian state-space models (SSMs) fitted to satellite tracking data processed with KF algorithm. Tracks from 7 harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) tagged with ARGOS satellite transmitters equipped with Fastloc GPS loggers were used to calculate the error of locations estimated from SSMs fitted to KF and LS data, by comparing those to “true” GPS locations. Data on 6 fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were used to investigate consistency in movement parameters, location and behavioural states estimated by switching state-space models (SSSM) fitted to data derived from KF and LS methods. The model fit to KF locations improved the accuracy of seal trips by 27% over the LS model. 82% of locations predicted from the KF model and 73% of locations from the LS model were <5 km from the corresponding interpolated GPS position. Uncertainty in KF model estimates (5.6±5.6 km) was nearly half that of LS estimates (11.6±8.4 km). Accuracy of KF and LS modelled locations was sensitive to precision but not to observation frequency or temporal resolution of raw Argos data. On average, 88% of whale locations estimated by KF models fell within the 95% probability ellipse of paired locations from LS models. Precision of KF locations for whales was generally higher. Whales’ behavioural mode inferred by KF models matched the classification from LS models in 94% of the cases. State-space models fit to KF data can improve spatial accuracy of location estimates over LS models and produce equally reliable behavioural estimates."

Typically, these enzymes utilize a non-heme iron center to oxidatively cleave a carbon-carbon double bond of a carotenoid substrate. Some members also isomerize specific double bonds in their substrates to yield cis-apocarotenoid products. The apocarotenoid oxygenase from Synechocystis has been hypothesized to represent one such member of this latter category of CCEs. Here, we developed a novel expression and purification protocol that enabled production of soluble, native ACO in quantities sufficient for high resolution structural and spectroscopic investigation of its catalytic mechanism. High performance liquid chromatography and Raman spectroscopy revealed that ACO exclusively formed all-trans products. We also found that linear polyoxyethylene detergents previously used for ACO crystallization strongly inhibited the apocarotenoid oxygenase activity of the enzyme. We crystallized the native enzyme in the absence of apocarotenoid substrate and found electron density in the active site that was similar in appearance to the density previously attributed to a di-cis-apocarotenoid intermediate. Our results clearly demonstrated that ACO is in fact a non-isomerizing member of the CCE family.

https://openalex.org/W2069600241,"Introduction Clinical staging of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is crucial for the choice of treatment. Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are typically recommended and used for staging of the cervical lymph nodes (LNs). Although ultrasonography (US) is a non-expensive, accessible and non-ionising imaging modality this method is not consistently used. This study aimed to investigate if addition of US of patients classified as clinically LN negative (cN0) by CT and/or MRI, increases the detection of LN metastases. Also, we aimed to identify which of the sonographic characteristics: echogenicity, border, shape, appearance of hilum and nodal blood-flow pattern best detect metastases in this patient group. Method Fifty-one patients with OSCC classified as cN0 by CT/MRI were consecutively included and prospectively examined with US prior to sentinel node biopsy or selective neck dissection. Localisation, size and sonographic characteristics were registered for each LN and compared with the pathological findings. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for different size measurements and sonographic characteristics. Results We found that short axial diameter was the best size criterion for detection of metastases. However, the sonographic characteristics were better predictors than size and the presence at least four of the sonographic characteristics: hypo-echoic or heterogeneous appearance; irregular border; spherical shape; absence of nodal hilum; and peripheral nodal blood-flow resulted in a sensitivity of 43.8; specificity 91.4; PPV 70.0; and NPV 78.0. The number of patients with occult metastases decreased from 16 out of 51 (31%) to nine out of 51 (18%). Three patients (6%) were over-staged by US. Conclusion The addition of US to the clinical work-up of patients with cN0 OSCC increases the detection of metastases, thus US potentially reduces the number of patients requiring a secondary neck surgery after sentinel node biopsy."
https://openalex.org/W1993476352,"Metabolic flexibility is the key to the ecological success of the marine Roseobacter clade bacteria. We investigated the metabolic adaptation and the underlying changes in gene expression of Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL12T to anoxic life by a combination of metabolome, proteome, and transcriptome analyses. Time-resolved studies during continuous oxygen depletion were performed in a chemostat using nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Formation of the denitrification machinery was found enhanced on the transcriptional and proteome level, indicating that D. shibae DFL12T established nitrate respiration to compensate for the depletion of the electron acceptor oxygen. In parallel, arginine fermentation was induced. During the transition state, growth and ATP concentration were found to be reduced, as reflected by a decrease of A578 values and viable cell counts. In parallel, the central metabolism, including gluconeogenesis, protein biosynthesis, and purine/pyrimidine synthesis was found transiently reduced in agreement with the decreased demand for cellular building blocks. Surprisingly, an accumulation of poly-3-hydroxybutanoate was observed during prolonged incubation under anoxic conditions. One possible explanation is the storage of accumulated metabolites and the regeneration of NADP+ from NADPH during poly-3-hydroxybutanoate synthesis (NADPH sink). Although D. shibae DFL12T was cultivated in the dark, biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophyll was increased, possibly to prepare for additional energy generation via aerobic anoxygenic photophosphorylation. Overall, oxygen depletion led to a metabolic crisis with partly blocked pathways and the accumulation of metabolites. In response, major energy-consuming processes were reduced until the alternative respiratory denitrification machinery was operative.

The mixotrophic D. shibae DFL12T can utilize a relatively small range of carbon sources like carboxylic acids, glucose, and glycerol. However, it is not able to grow with butanoate, ethanol, or methanol (1Biebl H. Allgaier M. Tindall B.J. Koblizek M. Lünsdorf H. Pukall R. Wagner-Döbler I.

Because a phosphofructokinase activity is missing, D. shibae DFL12T uses the Entner-Doudoroff pathway instead of the standard glycolysis pathway (6Fürch T. Preusse M. Tomasch J. Zech H.

Moreover, D. shibae DFL12T is able to perform aerobic anoxygenic photophosphorylation to gain additional energy (1Biebl H. Allgaier M. Tindall B.J. Koblizek M. Lünsdorf H. Pukall R. Wagner-Döbler I.

Indeed, the 4.4-Mb genome of D. shibae DFL12T contains genes encoding enzymes of the denitrification pathway (8Wagner-Döbler I. Ballhausen B. Berger M. Brinkhoff T. Buchholz I. Bunk B. Cypionka H.

Denitrification is the reduction of nitrate in four sequential steps into dinitrogen by the concomitant generation of a proton-motive force, which fuels ATP synthesis via ATPase (9Zumft W.G. Cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the bacterium possesses a nap operon encoding the periplasmic nitrate reductase NapA (EC 1.7.99.4) catalyzing the reduction of NO3− to NO2− instead of a cytoplasmic NarG nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.99.4) as known from other denitrifying bacteria (9Zumft W.G. Cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). The nir operon encoding the periplasmic nitrite reductase NirS (EC 1.7.2.1) that catalyzes the reduction of NO2− to NO, the nor operon encoding the nitric oxide reductase NorB (EC: 1.7.2.5) that reduces NO to N2O, and the nos operon encoding the nitrous oxide reductase NosZ (EC: 1.7.2.4) that converts N2O to N2 are also present in the genome of D. shibae DFL12T (8Wagner-Döbler I.

Furthermore, D. shibae DFL12T possesses genes for the assimilatory nitrate reductase NasA (EC 1.7.99.4) and the two subunits of the assimilatory nitrite reductase NasDE (EC 1.7.1.4). Additionally, genes for high affinity cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidases and alternative oxygen-independent NADH dehydrogenases necessary for energy generation via anaerobic respiration were identified in the genome of D. shibae DFL12T (8Wagner-Döbler I.

Moreover, genes necessary for mixed acid fermentation were identified in the genome of D. shibae DFL12T (8Wagner-Döbler I. Ballhausen B. Berger M. Brinkhoff T. Buchholz I. Bunk B. Cypionka H.

With its genetic equipment, D. shibae DFL12T should be able to convert pyruvate to acetate and ethanol. However, experimental details of its regulatory and metabolic response to lack of oxygen are still missing. Recently, a transposon mutagenesis study using D. shibae DFL12T identified nitrate reductase and corresponding cofactor-synthesizing enzyme-encoding genes as essential for anaerobic growth (11Ebert M. Laass S. Burghartz M. Petersen J. Kossmehl S. Wöhlbrand L. Rabus R. Wittmann C. Tielen P. Jahn D. Transposon mutagenesis identified chromosomal and plasmid genes essential for adaptation of the marine bacterium Dinoroseobacter shibae to anaerobic conditions.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, chromosomal and plasmid-encoded genes involved in membrane-localized sodium gradient-dependent processes, genomic rearrangements, and cellular envelope restructuring were indispensable for growth without oxygen (11Ebert M.

Recently, first systems biology-oriented studies with Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 17395 (formerly deposited as Phaeobacter gallaeciensis DSM 17395) (12Buddruhs N. Pradella S. Göker M. Päuker O.

Dynamics of amino acid utilization in Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 17395.Proteomics. 2013; 13: 2869-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In comparison with D. shibae DFL12T, P. inhibens DSM 17395 is able to degrade a wide range of carbon sources. It shows a preference for amino acids as carbon sources related to its habitat (15Drüppel K. Hensler M. Trautwein K. Kossmehl S. Wöhlbrand L. Schmidt-Hohagen K. Ulbrich M. Bergen N. Meyer-Kolthoff J.

Microbiol. 2014; 16: 218-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This underlines the need for systematic investigations of this group of bacteria as a precondition to unravel the survival strategies of Roseobacter clade bacteria in the marine environment. Here, we present a systematic investigation using transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analysis to unravel the metabolic adaptation of D. shibae DFL12T to oxygen depletion with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Continuous cultivation of D. shibae DFL12T was performed in salt water minimal medium with 5 mm succinate as a carbon source and 25 mm nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor in an Inforce HT Multifors 2 reactor (Infors, Bottmingen, Switzerland) at 30 °C, pH 8.0, with aeration of 0.7 liter of air/min and a stirring speed of 150 rpm. The working volume of the reactor was 1 liter. The chemostat was protected from light by covering with aluminum foil to avoid aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis of D. shibae DFL12T. Inoculation, starting of the continuous cultivation, and the anaerobic shift were done as described before (11Ebert M. Laass S. Burghartz M. Petersen J. Kossmehl S. Wöhlbrand L. Rabus R. Wittmann C. Tielen P. Jahn D. Transposon mutagenesis identified chromosomal and plasmid genes essential for adaptation of the marine bacterium Dinoroseobacter shibae to anaerobic conditions.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nitrate at a concentration of 25 mm was continuously supplemented to the culture. Fig. 1 shows the consumption of the residual oxygen and the slightly decreasing cell, optical density, and time points of sampling for the observation of the adaptation. For determination of the nitrate concentration, a 2-ml sample of a D. shibae DFL12T culture was heated for 20 min at 80 °C and centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was sterilized using a cellulose-acetate filter with a pore size of 0.2 μm (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). The investigated time points were prior to the anaerobic shift (0 min) and 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after the oxygen supply was switched off. The determination of nitrate and nitrite was performed using the nitrite/nitrate colorimetric test (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A whole genome microarray of D. shibae DFL12T from Agilent (8 × 15K format; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) was used as described before (16Tomasch J. Gohl R. Bunk B. Diez M.S. Wagner-Döbler I. Transcriptional response of the photoheterotrophic marine bacterium Dinoroseobacter shibae to changing light regimes.ISME J. 2011; 5: 1957-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Time-resolved transcriptome analyses were performed with three technical and three biological replicates. Pairwise comparisons of obtained expression rates for different time points after the shift to anoxic conditions with data obtained prior to anaerobic shift (0 min) were made (Table 1). The investigated time points were 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, and 120 min after the oxygen supply was switched off (Fig. 1). Cell harvesting, RNA isolation, and DNA arrays were processed as described before (11Ebert M. Laass S. Burghartz M. Petersen J. Kossmehl S. Wöhlbrand L. Rabus R. Wittmann C. Tielen P. Jahn D.

Following reduction and alkylation of 50 μg of total cellular protein, proteolytic digest was performed overnight with 0.5 μg of trypsin GOLD (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Finally, 1 μg of total digested protein was separated applying a 215-min gradient of increasing acetonitrile concentration using an UltiMate 3000 nano-LC (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) online-coupled to an electrospray-ionization ion trap mass spectrometer (amaZon ETD, Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) operated as described before (13Zech H.

Three biological replicates were analyzed. Protein identification was performed with ProteinScape (version 3.0; Bruker Daltonik GmbH) on a Mascot server (version 2.3; Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) searching against a genomic database of D. shibae DFL12T translated into amino acid sequences, including a target-decoy strategy. A single missed cleavage was allowed for tryptic peptides. Furthermore, carbamidomethylation (cysteine) as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification as well as a mass tolerance (monoisotopic) of 0.4 Da for MS and MS/MS were chosen. Searching was restricted to doubly and triply charged peptides. The instrument type was ESI-TRAP. A false discovery rate of <1.0% was set. The significance threshold was p < 0.05, and only peptides with a Mascot score of >25 were considered for protein identification. The investigated time points were 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after the oxygen supply was switched off (Fig. 1).

Protein extracts of cells grown under oxic conditions (0 min) served as reference state and were labeled with Cy5. Protein extracts of cells harvested after shutdown of the oxygen supply served as test states and were each labeled with Cy3. The internal standard was composed of equal amounts of all test states and the reference state and was labeled with Cy2. Isoelectric focusing (pH range of 3.0–5.6 and 3–11 non-linear) and second dimension separation were performed as described previously (13Zech H. Hensler M. Kossmehl S. Drüppel K. Wöhlbrand L.

Time-resolved analysis of PHB concentration was performed in three biological replicates. The investigated time points were 0 min (before stopping the aeration), 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after oxygen supply was switched off. 2 ml of the chemostat culture were harvested and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C.

Whether RBP4 contributes to cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unknown. Methods We assessed RBP4 concentrations and those of endothelial activation molecules including E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by ELISA, and the common carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) and carotid artery plaque by ultrasound in 217 (112 black and 105 white) patients with RA. Relationships were identified in potential confounder and mediator adjusted mixed regression models. Results RBP4 concentrations were associated with systolic and mean blood pressure, and those of glucose and E-selectin (partial R = −0.207 (p = 0.003), −0.195 (p = 0.006), −0.155 (p = 0.03) and −0.191 (p = 0.007), respectively in all patients); these RBP4-cardiovascular risk relations were mostly reproduced in patients with but not without adverse traditional or non-traditional cardiovascular risk profiles. RBP4 concentrations were not associated with atherosclerosis in all patients, but related independently to cIMT (partial R = 0.297, p = 0.03) and plaque (OR (95%CI) = 2.95 (1.31–6.68), p = 0.008) in those with generalized obesity, as well as with plaque in those with abdominal obesity (OR (95%CI) = 1.95 (1.12–3.42), p = 0.01). Conclusion In the present study, RBP4 concentrations were inversely associated with metabolic risk and endothelial activation in RA. This requires further investigation. RBP4 concentrations were related to enhanced atherosclerosis in patients with generalized or/and abdominal obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2003289983,"Cancer is a heterogeneous and tissue-specific disease. Thus, the tissue of origin reflects on the natural history of the disease and dictates the therapeutic approach. It is suggested that tissue differentiation, mediated mostly by epigenetic modifications, could guide tissue-specific susceptibility and protective mechanisms against cancer. Here we studied breast specific methylation in purified normal epithelium and its reflection in breast cancers. We established genome wide methylation profiles of various normal epithelial tissues and identified 110 genes that were differentially methylated in normal breast epithelium. A number of these genes also showed methylation alterations in breast cancers. We elaborated on one of them, TRIM29 (ATDC), and showed that its promoter was hypo-methylated in normal breast epithelium and heavily methylated in other normal epithelial tissues. Moreover, in breast carcinomas methylation increased and expression decreased whereas the reverse was noted for multiple other carcinomas. Interestingly, TRIM29 regulation in breast tumors clustered according to the PAM50 classification. Thus, it was repressed in the estrogen receptor positive tumors, particularly in the more proliferative luminal B subtype. This goes in line with previous reports indicating tumor suppressive activity of TRIM29 in estrogen receptor positive luminal breast cells in contrast to oncogenic function in pancreatic and lung cancers. Overall, these findings emphasize the linkage between breast specific epigenetic regulation and tissue specificity of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1994133720,"As a facultative anaerobe, Vibrio cholerae can grow by anaerobic respiration. Production of cholera toxin (CT), a major virulence factor of V. cholerae, is highly promoted during anaerobic growth using trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) as an alternative electron acceptor. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of TMAO-stimulated CT production and uncovered the crucial involvement of stringent response in this process. V. cholerae 7th pandemic strain N16961 produced a significantly elevated level of ppGpp, the bacterial stringent response alarmone, during anaerobic TMAO respiration. Bacterial viability was impaired, and DNA replication was also affected under the same growth condition, further suggesting that stringent response is induced. A ΔrelA ΔspoT ppGpp overproducer strain produced an enhanced level of CT, whereas anaerobic growth via TMAO respiration was severely inhibited. In contrast, a ppGpp-null strain (ΔrelA ΔspoT ΔrelV) grew substantially better, but produced no CT, suggesting that CT production and bacterial growth are inversely regulated in response to ppGpp accumulation. Bacterial capability to produce CT was completely lost when the dksA gene, which encodes a protein that works cooperatively with ppGpp, was deleted. In the ΔdksA mutant, stringent response growth inhibition was alleviated, further supporting the inverse regulation of CT production and anaerobic growth. In vivo virulence of ΔrelA ΔspoT ΔrelV or ΔdksA mutants was significantly attenuated. The ΔrelA ΔspoT mutant maintained virulence when infected with exogenous TMAO despite its defective growth. Together, our results reveal that stringent response is activated under TMAO-stimulated anaerobic growth, and it regulates CT production in a growth-dependent manner in V. cholerae."
https://openalex.org/W2055714182,"Protein-tyrosine kinase C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) was originally purified as a kinase for phosphorylating Src and other Src family kinases. The phosphorylation of a C-terminal tyrosine residue of Src family kinases suppresses their kinase activity. Therefore, most physiological studies regarding Csk function have been focused on Csk as a negative regulator of Src family tyrosine kinases and as a potential tumor suppressor. Paradoxically, the protein levels of Csk were elevated in some human carcinomas. In this report, we show that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is a new protein substrate of Csk and could locate in the nucleus. We demonstrate that Csk-mediated phosphorylation of eEF2 has no effect on its cytoplasmic function in regulating protein translation. However, phosphorylation of eEF2 enhances its proteolytic cleavage and the nuclear translocation of the cleaved eEF2 through a SUMOylation-regulated process. Furthermore, we show that cleaved fragments of eEF2 can induce nuclear morphological changes and aneuploidy similar to those in cancer cells, suggesting that there is an additional mechanism for Csk in tumorigenesis through regulation of eEF2 subcellular localization."
https://openalex.org/W2058052694,"Prenatal stress (PS) represents a critical variable affecting lifetime health trajectories, metabolic and vascular functions. Beneficial experiences may attenuate the effects of PS and its programming of health outcomes in later life. Here we investigated in a rat model (1) if PS modulates recovery following cortical ischemia in adulthood; (2) if a second hit by adult stress (AS) exaggerates stress responses and ischemic damage; and (3) if tactile stimulation (TS) attenuates the cumulative effects of PS and AS. Prenatally stressed and non-stressed adult male rats underwent focal ischemic motor cortex lesion and were tested in skilled reaching and skilled walking tasks. Two groups of rats experienced recurrent restraint stress in adulthood and one of these groups also underwent daily TS therapy. Animals that experienced both PS and AS displayed the most severe motor disabilities after lesion. By contrast, TS promoted recovery from ischemic lesion and reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. The data also showed that cumulative effects of adverse and beneficial lifespan experiences interact with disease outcomes and brain plasticity through the modulation of gene expression. Microarray analysis of the lesion motor cortex revealed that cumulative PS and AS interact with genes related to growth factors and transcription factors, which were not affected by PS or lesion alone. TS in PS+AS animals reverted these changes, suggesting a critical role for these factors in activity-dependent motor cortical reorganization after ischemic lesion. These findings suggest that beneficial experience later in life can moderate adverse consequences of early programming to improve cerebrovascular health."
https://openalex.org/W2058467186,"To achieve effective intracellular anticancer drug delivery, the polymeric vesicles supplemented with the pH-responsive outlayered gels as a delivery system of doxorubicin (DOX) were developed from self-assembly of the lipid/polypeptide adduct, distearin grafted poly(γ-glutamic acid) (poly(γ-GA)), followed by sequential deposition of chitosan and poly(γ-GA-co-γ-glutamyl oxysuccinimide)-g-monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) in combination with in situ covalent cross-linking on assembly surfaces. The resultant gel-caged polymeric vesicles (GCPVs) showed superior performance in regulating drug release in response to the external pH change. Under typical physiological conditions (pH 7.4 and 37 °C) at which the γ-GA/DOX ionic pairings remained mostly undisturbed, the dense outlayered gels of GCPVs significantly reduced the premature leakage of the uncomplexed payload. With the environmental pH being reduced from pH 7.4 to 4.7, the drug liberation was appreciably promoted by the massive disruption of the ionic γ-GA/DOX complexes along with the significant swelling of nanogel layers upon the increased protonation of chitosan chain segments. After being internalized by HeLa cells via endocytosis, GCPVs exhibited cytotoxic effect comparable to free DOX achieved by rapidly releasing the payload in intracellular acidic endosomes and lysosomes. This strongly implies the great promise of such unique GCPVs as an intracellular drug delivery carrier for potential anticancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2093961448,"An understanding of how the degree of phylogenetic relatedness influences the ecological similarity among species is crucial to inferring the mechanisms governing the assembly of communities. We evaluated the relative importance of spider phylogenetic relationships and ecological niche (plant morphological variables) to the variation in spider body size and shape by comparing spiders at different scales: (i) between bromeliads and dicot plants (i.e., habitat scale) and (ii) among bromeliads with distinct architectural features (i.e., microhabitat scale). We partitioned the interspecific variation in body size and shape into phylogenetic (that express trait values as expected by phylogenetic relationships among species) and ecological components (that express trait values independent of phylogenetic relationships). At the habitat scale, bromeliad spiders were larger and flatter than spiders associated with the surrounding dicots. At this scale, plant morphology sorted out close related spiders. Our results showed that spider flatness is phylogenetically clustered at the habitat scale, whereas it is phylogenetically overdispersed at the microhabitat scale, although phylogenic signal is present in both scales. Taken together, these results suggest that whereas at the habitat scale selective colonization affect spider body size and shape, at fine scales both selective colonization and adaptive evolution determine spider body shape. By partitioning the phylogenetic and ecological components of phenotypic variation, we were able to disentangle the evolutionary history of distinct spider traits and show that plant architecture plays a role in the evolution of spider body size and shape. We also discussed the relevance in considering multiple scales when studying phylogenetic community structure."

Abcc9 encodes a membrane-associated receptor that partners with a potassium channel to become the major potassium-sensitive ATP channel in the heart. Abcc9 also encodes a smaller protein enriched in the mitochondria. We now deleted exon 5 of Abcc9 to ablate expression of both plasma membrane and mitochondria-associated Abcc9-encoded proteins, and found that the myocardium failed to acquire normal mature metabolism, resulting in neonatal cardiomyopathy. Unlike wild-type neonatal cardiomyocytes, mitochondria from Ex5 cardiomyocytes were unresponsive to the KATP agonist diazoxide, consistent with loss of KATP activity. When exposed to hydrogen peroxide to induce cell stress, Ex5 neonatal cardiomyocytes displayed a rapid collapse of mitochondria membrane potential, distinct from wild-type cardiomyocytes. Ex5 cardiomyocytes had reduced fatty acid oxidation, reduced oxygen consumption and reserve. Morphologically, Ex5 cardiac mitochondria exhibited an immature pattern with reduced cross-sectional area and intermitochondrial contacts. In the absence of Abcc9, the newborn heart fails to transition normally from fetal to mature myocardial metabolism.—Fahrenbach, J. P., Stoller, D., Kim, G., Aggarwal, N., Yerokun, B., Earley, J.

https://openalex.org/W1986249234,"In patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel in reducing cardiovascular events. This study sought to evaluate the effect of clopidogrel pretreatment on the pharmacodynamics of ticagrelor in patients undergoing PPCI.We measured platelet reactivity using the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours following ticagrelor bolus in patients previously loaded with clopidogrel (C+T) and in thienopyridine-naive patients (T) referred to our centre for PPCI.In total, 52 consecutive eligible patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were enrolled (27 C+T and 25 T). Baseline characteristics and mean baseline platelet reactivity units (PRUs) were similar between the groups. The primary endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving a PRU<208 at 2 hours, was more frequently achieved in the C+T group compared to T treatment (76.0% vs 44.4%, p= 0.026). Notably, C+T therapy resulted in fewer patients with high platelet reactivity at 1 hour (56.0% vs. 14.8%), 4 hours (100.0% vs. 61.5%) and 6 hours (100.0% vs. 64%, p<0.01 for all comparisons). Furthermore, C+T therapy was associated with lower PRU values from 2 to 48 hours.In patients referred for PPCI, ticagrelor bolus following clopidogrel resulted in more rapid and profound platelet inhibition, demonstrating a positive pharmacodynamic interaction. Further study is needed to determine if this pharmacodynamic effect translates into reduced clinical events."
https://openalex.org/W2063010328,"Constitutively activated variants of small GTPases, which provide valuable functional probes of their role in cellular signaling pathways, can often be generated by mutating the canonical catalytic residue (e.g. Ras Q61L) to impair GTP hydrolysis. However, this general approach is ineffective for a substantial fraction of the small GTPase family in which this residue is not conserved (e.g. Rap) or not catalytic (e.g. Rheb). Using a novel engineering approach, we have manipulated nucleotide binding through structure-guided substitutions of an ultraconserved glycine residue in the G3-box motif (DXXG). Substitution of Rheb Gly-63 with alanine impaired both intrinsic and TSC2 GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-mediated GTP hydrolysis by displacing the hydrolytic water molecule, whereas introduction of a bulkier valine side chain selectively blocked GTP binding by steric occlusion of the γ-phosphate. Rheb G63A stimulated phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate p70S6 kinase more strongly than wild-type, thus offering a new tool for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2011960622,"The gap in Kenya between need and treatment for mental disorders is wide, and private providers are increasingly offering services, funded in part by private health insurance (PHI). Chiromo, a 30-bed psychiatric hospital in Nairobi, forms part of one of the largest private psychiatric providers in East Africa. The study evaluated the effects of insurance on service use and charge, questioning implications on access to care. Data derive from invoices for 455 sequential patients, including 12-month follow-up. Multi-linear and binary logistic regressions explored the effect of PHI on readmission, cumulative length of stay, and treatment charge. Patients were 66.4% male with a mean age of 36.8 years. Half were employed in the formal sector. 70% were admitted involuntarily. Diagnoses were: substance use disorder 31.6%; serious mental disorder 49.5%; common mental disorder 7%; comorbid 7%; other 4.9%. In addition to daily psychiatric consultations, two-thirds received individual counselling or group therapy; half received lab tests or scans; and 16.2% received ECT. Most took a psychiatric medicine. Half of those on antipsychotics were given only brands. Insurance paid in full for 28.8% of patients. Mean length of stay was 11.8 days and, in 12 months, 16.7 days (median 10.6). 22.2% were readmitted within 12 months. Patients with PHI stayed 36% longer than those paying out-of-pocket and had 2.5 times higher odds of readmission. Mean annual charge per patient was Int$ 4,262 (median Int$ 2,821). Insurers were charged 71% more than those paying out-of-pocket - driven by higher fees and longer stays. Chiromo delivers acute psychiatric care each year to approximately 450 people, to quality and human rights standards higher than its public counterpart, but at considerably higher cost. With more efficient delivery and wider insurance coverage, Chiromo might expand from its occupancy of 56.6% to reach a larger population in need."
https://openalex.org/W2018752349,We have previously shown that the respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] can productively infect monocyte derived dendritic cells [MoDC] and remain dormant within the same cells for prolonged periods. It is therefore possible that infected dendritic cells act as a reservoir within the airways of individuals between annual epidemics. In the present study we explored the possibility that sub-epithelial DCs can be infected with RSV from differentiated bronchial epithelium and that in turn RSV from DCs can infect the epithelium. A dual co-culture model was established in which a differentiated primary airway epithelium on an Air Liquid Interface (ALI) was cultured on a transwell insert and MoDCs were subsequently added to the basolateral membrane of the insert. Further experiments were undertaken using a triple co-culture model in which in which macrophages were added to the apical surface of the differentiated epithelium. A modified RSV [rr-RSV] expressing a red fluorescent protein marker of replication was used to infect either the MoDCs or the differentiated epithelium and infection of the reciprocal cell type was assessed using confocal microscopy. Our data shows that primary epithelium became infected when rr-RSV infected MoDCs were introduced onto the basal surface of the transwell insert. MoDCs located beneath the epithelium did not become infected with virus from infected epithelial cells in the dual co-culture model. However when macrophages were present on the apical surface of the primary epithelium infection of the basal MoDCs occurred. Our data suggests that RSV infected dendritic cells readily transmit infection to epithelial cells even when they are located beneath the basal layer. However macrophages appear to be necessary for the transmission of infection from epithelial cells to basal dendritic cells.
https://openalex.org/W2046741242,"DNA topoisomerase I from Plasmodium falciparum (PfTopoI), a potential selective target for chemotherapy and drug development against malaria, is used here, together with human Topo I (HssTopoI), for docking, molecular dynamics (MD) studies and experimental assays. Six synthetic isoflavonoid derivatives and the known PfTopoI inhibitors camptothecin and topotecan were evaluated in parallel. Theoretical results suggest that these compounds dock in the binding site of camptothecin and topotecan inside both enzymes and that LQB223 binds selectively in PfTopoI. In vitro tests against P. falciparum blood parasites corroborated the theoretical findings. The selectivity index (SI) of LQB223 ≥98 suggests that this molecule is the most promising in the group of compounds tested. In vivo experiments in mice infected with P. berghei showed that LQB223 has an antimalarial activity similar to that of chloroquine."
https://openalex.org/W2115059223,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation (H3K56ac) is a modification of new H3 molecules deposited throughout the genome during S-phase. H3K56ac is removed by the sirtuins Hst3 and Hst4 at later stages of the cell cycle. Previous studies indicated that regulated degradation of Hst3 plays an important role in the genome-wide waves of H3K56 acetylation and deacetylation that occur during each cell cycle. However, little is known regarding the mechanism of cell cycle-regulated Hst3 degradation. Here, we demonstrate that Hst3 instability in vivo is dependent upon the ubiquitin ligase SCF(Cdc4) and that Hst3 is phosphorylated at two Cdk1 sites, threonine 380 and threonine 384. This creates a diphosphorylated degron that is necessary for Hst3 polyubiquitylation by SCF(Cdc4). Mutation of the Hst3 diphospho-degron does not completely stabilize Hst3 in vivo, but it nonetheless results in a significant fitness defect that is particularly severe in mutant cells treated with the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate. Unexpectedly, we show that Hst3 can be degraded between G2 and anaphase, a window of the cell cycle where Hst3 normally mediates genome-wide deacetylation of H3K56. Our results suggest an intricate coordination between Hst3 synthesis, genome-wide H3K56 deacetylation by Hst3, and cell cycle-regulated degradation of Hst3 by cyclin-dependent kinases and SCF(Cdc4)."
https://openalex.org/W1998892848,"Abortive cycling is a universal feature of transcription initiation catalyzed by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RNAP). In bacteriophage T7 RNAP, mutation of proline 266 to leucine (P266L) in the C-linker region connecting the N-terminal promoter binding domain with the C-terminal catalytic domain drastically reduces short abortive products (4-7 nt) while marginally increasing long abortives (9-11 nt). Here we have investigated the transcription initiation pathway of P266L with the goal of understanding the mechanistic basis for short and long abortive synthesis. We show that the P266L mutation does not alter the affinity for the promoter, mildly affects promoter opening, and increases the +1/+2 GTP K(d) by 2-fold. However, unlike wild-type T7 RNAP that undergoes stepwise rotation of the promoter binding domain and DNA scrunching during initial transcription, the P266L mutant does not undergo coupled rotational/scrunching movements until 7 nt RNA synthesis. The lack of rotation/scrunching correlates with greater stabilities of the initiation complexes of the P266L and decreased short abortive products. The results indicate that the increased flexibility in the C-linker due to P266L mutation enables T7 RNAP to absorb the stress from the growing RNA:DNA hybrid thereby decreasing short abortive products. Increased C-linker flexibility, however, has an adverse effect of delaying the transition into elongation by 1-2 nt, which gives rise to long abortive products. However, a mutation in the upstream promoter region greatly decreases long abortive products in P266L reactions, rendering the combination of P266L and A-15C promoter a desirable pair for efficient in vitro transcription for RNA production. We conclude that the conformational rigidity in the C-linker region conferred by the proline at position 266 is responsible for the undesirable short abortive products, but the rigidity is critical for efficient promoter clearance and transition into elongation."

An animal model corresponding to the human immuno-pathologic features of midge allergy is needed for investigating the mechanisms and therapies. This study successfully developed a murine model of Forcipomyia taiwana allergy.BALB/c mice were sensitized intra-peritoneally with midge extract on days 0, 7, 14, 21 then intra-dermally on days 28, 31 and 35. Serum midge-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a were measured every 14 days by indirect ELISA. The mice were challenged intradermally with midge extract at day 40 and then sacrificed. Proliferation and cytokine production of splenocytes after stimulation with midge extract were determined by MTT assay and ELISA, respectively. The cytokine mRNA expression in response to midge stimulation was analyzed by RT-PCR.Serum IgE, total IgG, and IgG1 antibody levels against midge extract were significantly higher in the midge-sensitized mice than in the control mice. After the two-step sensitization, all mice in the midge-sensitized group displayed immediate itch and plasma extravasation reactions in response to challenge with midge extract. Skin histology from midge-sensitized mice showed marked eosinophil and lymphocyte infiltrations similar to that observed in humans. Stimulation of murine splenocytes with midge extract elicited significant proliferation, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-γ protein production, and up-regulation of mRNA in a dose-dependent manner in the midge-sensitized group, but not in the control group.A murine model of midge bite allergy has been successfully developed using a two-step sensitization protocol. The sensitized mice have very similar clinical and immunologic reactions to challenge with midge proteins as the reactions of human to midge bites. This murine model may be a useful platform for future research and the development of treatment strategies for insect bite allergy."
https://openalex.org/W2138826756,"Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is an inherited disorder of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO). Patients with VLCAD deficiency may present with hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, cardiomyopathy, and myopathy. Although several mouse models have been developed to aid in the study of the pathogenesis of long-chain FAO defects, the muscular phenotype is underexposed. To address the muscular phenotype, we used a newly developed mouse model on a mixed genetic background with a more severe defect in FAO (LCAD(-/-); VLCAD(+/-)) in addition to a validated mouse model (LCAD(-/-); VLCAD(+/+)) and compared them with wild-type (WT) mice. We found that both mouse models show a 20% reduction in energy expenditure (EE) and a 3-fold decrease in locomotor activity in the unfed state. In addition, we found a 1.7°C drop in body temperature in unfed LCAD(-/-); VLCAD(+/+) mice compared with WT body temperature. We conclude that food withdrawal-induced inactivity, hypothermia, and reduction in EE are novel phenotypes associated with FAO deficiency in mice. Unexpectedly, inactivity was not explained by rhabdomyolysis, but rather reflected the overall reduced capacity of these mice to generate heat. We suggest that mice are partly protected against the negative consequence of an FAO defect.-Diekman, E. F., van Weeghel, M., Wanders, R. J. A., Visser, G., Houten, S. M. Food withdrawal lowers energy expenditure and induces inactivity in long-chain fatty acid oxidation-deficient mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W2060532445,"Nativists have postulated fundamental geometric knowledge that predates linguistic and symbolic thought. Central to these claims is the proposal for an isolated cognitive system dedicated to processing geometric information. Testing such hypotheses presents challenges due to difficulties in eliminating the combination of geometric and non-geometric information through language. We present evidence using a modified matching interference paradigm that an incongruent shape word interferes with identifying a two-dimensional geometric shape, but an incongruent two-dimensional geometric shape does not interfere with identifying a shape word. This asymmetry in interference effects between two-dimensional geometric shapes and their corresponding shape words suggests that shape words activate spatial representations of shapes but shapes do not activate linguistic representations of shape words. These results appear consistent with hypotheses concerning a cognitive system dedicated to processing geometric information isolated from linguistic processing and provide evidence consistent with hypotheses concerning knowledge of geometric properties of space that predates linguistic and symbolic thought."

Still, some deaf musicians continue to perform with their CI. Here we show unexpected results that CI musicians can reliably tune a guitar by CI alone and, under controlled conditions, match simultaneously presented tones to <0.5 Hz. One subject had normal contralateral hearing and produced more accurate tuning with CI than his normal ear. To understand these counterintuitive findings, we presented tones sequentially and found that tuning error was larger at ∼ 30 Hz for both subjects. A third subject, a non-musician CI user with normal contralateral hearing, showed similar trends in performance between CI and normal hearing ears but with less precision. This difference, along with electric analysis, showed that accurate tuning was achieved by listening to beats rather than discriminating pitch, effectively turning a spectral task into a temporal discrimination task."
https://openalex.org/W1969487987,"Objective Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the mineralization and fragmentation of elastic fibers in the skin, retina, and vascular walls. While there is no doubt that peripheral arterial disease is associated with PXE, several other cardiac complications have been linked with PXE, mainly based on case reports. It remains unclear, whether cardiac systolic or diastolic function impairment is a common complication of PXE. Methods This study conducted systematic assessment of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function via standard echocardiography and two-dimensional strain imaging, in a large cohort of asymptomatic PXE patients (n = 75) and matched healthy controls (n = 30). Results PXE and controls did not differ in terms of any of the diastolic parameters tested: E-wave (82±17 cm/s vs. 82±13 cm/s, p = 0.890), E deceleration time (191.7±55.6 ms vs. 190.0±35.9 ms, p = 0.879), and E/Em ratio (7.1±2.3 vs. 7.0±1.8, p = 0.829). In addition, no significant differences were observed between PXE and control in terms of left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, as well as global, basal, mid, and apex longitudinal strains. Conclusions These findings revealed that preclinical cardiac dysfunction is uncommon in a large population of asymptomatic PXE patients."
