https://openalex.org/W2044998957,"Experimental and theoretical studies of small clusters of metal atoms are aimed at revealing how properties change in the ultrafinely divided state. Thermodynamic, electronic, and structural features can be size-dependent and may be involved in determining the activity of small-particle catalysts. Correlations between these properties give indications of the features important in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2014174169,"Thin films that are grown by the process of sputtering are, by and large, quite unlike the smooth, featureless structures that one might expect. In general, these films have a complicated surface morphology and an extended network of grooves and voids in their interiors. Such features can have a profound effect on the physical properties of a thin film. The surface irregularities and the bulk defects are the result of a growth instability due to competitive shadowing, an effect that also plays a role in geological processes such as erosion. For amorphous thin films, the shadow instability can be described by a remarkably simple model, which can be shown to reproduce many important observed characteristics of thin film morphology."

The new technology of adaptive optics can overcome this problem by compensating for the wavefront distortion that results from turbulence. The result will be large gains in resolving power and limiting magnitude, closely approaching the theoretical limit. In other words, telescopic images will be very significantly sharpened. Rapid and accelerating progress is being made today by several groups. Adaptive optics, together with the closely related technology of active optics, seems certain to be utilized in large astronomical telescopes of the future. This may entail significant changes in telescope design."

However, there is no basic reason why tons rather than pounds cannot be treated. Continuous refiners have been designed and operated, and a suitable design theory exists (3)."
https://openalex.org/W1987473132,"Pollen analysis of pond deposits in the upper reaches of a stream from northeastern Iowa, an area beyond the last glacial margin, provides a nearly complete record of vegetational changes during the last 12.5 thousand years. Sixty-one radiocarbon dates provide good chronological control. Spruce forest was replaced by deciduous forest before 9.1 thousand years ago, followed by prairie from 5.4 to 3.5 thousand years ago, and oak savanna from 3.5 thousand years ago until presettlement times. The prairie invasion was nearly 3 thousand years later here than at other sites in Iowa and Minnesota, documenting a late Holocene, rather than an early-middle Holocene, period of maximum warmth and dryness for the southern part of the upper Midwest."

Experimental results, which have previously been obtained in the higher temperature regime by a shock tube technique, are combined with lower temperature results to give an experimental determination of the rate behavior over the large temperature range approximately 200 to 2000 K. It is now possible to assess the accuracy of ab initio potential energy surface calculations and to judge theoretical chemical kinetic methods."

https://openalex.org/W2079414604,"Automobile fuel-economy improvements are supposed to provide the major energy savings in the 1980's, but the DOE claims that Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ratings overstate actual road-condition savings. The shortfall could amount to as much as one million barrels of oil a day and offset the new domestic production from North Slope oil fields and synthetic fuel plants. The fuel economy program suffers from personnel shortages for confirmatory testing, but the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) feels the Department of Transportation (DOT) and EPA should update the personnel priorities. Improvements to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act are suggested that would eliminate some of the measuring assumptions creating much of the shortfall, specifically the differences between prototype and production-line cars and the differences between laboratory and road testing. The agencies and auto manufacturers disagree over who is to blame for the floundering fuel-economy program."

https://openalex.org/W2162743627,"It should be apparent that while there are many complicating factors in softening processes which tend to render some results inconsistent with others, progress in understanding these processes is being made, and certain unifying concepts have evolved. Realization of the differences in the reaction of metal systems to softening is now well established. Arbitrary division of the softening process into distinct stages has perhaps caused some confusion in the past, but with the use of new techniques, mechanistic details of the entire softening process are now being unfolded."
