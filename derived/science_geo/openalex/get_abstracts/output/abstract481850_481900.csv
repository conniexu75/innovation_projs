https://openalex.org/W2111003787,"Flow batteries, in which the electro-active components are held in fluid form external to the battery itself, are attractive as a potential means for regulating the output of intermittent renewable sources of electricity; an aqueous flow battery based on inexpensive commodity chemicals is now reported that also has the virtue of enabling further improvement of battery performance through organic chemical design. Flow batteries differ from the conventional type in that the electro-active components of flow batteries are held in fluid form external to the battery itself, enabling such systems to store arbitrarily large amounts of energy. Flow batteries are therefore attractive as a potential means for regulating the output of intermittent sources of electricity such as wind or solar power. But an important limitation of most such systems is the abundance and cost of the electro-active materials. To overcome this limitation, Brian Huskinson and colleagues have developed an aqueous flow battery on the basis of inexpensive, non-metallic commodity chemicals, with the added advantage of enabling the tuning of key battery properties through chemical design. As the fraction of electricity generation from intermittent renewable sources—such as solar or wind—grows, the ability to store large amounts of electrical energy is of increasing importance. Solid-electrode batteries maintain discharge at peak power for far too short a time to fully regulate wind or solar power output1,2. In contrast, flow batteries can independently scale the power (electrode area) and energy (arbitrarily large storage volume) components of the system by maintaining all of the electro-active species in fluid form3,4,5. Wide-scale utilization of flow batteries is, however, limited by the abundance and cost of these materials, particularly those using redox-active metals and precious-metal electrocatalysts6,7. Here we describe a class of energy storage materials that exploits the favourable chemical and electrochemical properties of a family of molecules known as quinones. The example we demonstrate is a metal-free flow battery based on the redox chemistry of 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulphonic acid (AQDS). AQDS undergoes extremely rapid and reversible two-electron two-proton reduction on a glassy carbon electrode in sulphuric acid. An aqueous flow battery with inexpensive carbon electrodes, combining the quinone/hydroquinone couple with the Br2/Br− redox couple, yields a peak galvanic power density exceeding 0.6 W cm−2 at 1.3 A cm−2. Cycling of this quinone–bromide flow battery showed >99 per cent storage capacity retention per cycle. The organic anthraquinone species can be synthesized from inexpensive commodity chemicals8. This organic approach permits tuning of important properties such as the reduction potential and solubility by adding functional groups: for example, we demonstrate that the addition of two hydroxy groups to AQDS increases the open circuit potential of the cell by 11% and we describe a pathway for further increases in cell voltage. The use of π-aromatic redox-active organic molecules instead of redox-active metals represents a new and promising direction for realizing massive electrical energy storage at greatly reduced cost."

https://openalex.org/W2061041720,"The emergence of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) from jawless vertebrates was accompanied by major morphological and physiological innovations, such as hinged jaws, paired fins and immunoglobulin-based adaptive immunity. Gnathostomes subsequently diverged into two groups, the cartilaginous fishes and the bony vertebrates. Here we report the whole-genome analysis of a cartilaginous fish, the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii). We find that the C. milii genome is the slowest evolving of all known vertebrates, including the ‘living fossil’ coelacanth, and features extensive synteny conservation with tetrapod genomes, making it a good model for comparative analyses of gnathostome genomes. Our functional studies suggest that the lack of genes encoding secreted calcium-binding phosphoproteins in cartilaginous fishes explains the absence of bone in their endoskeleton. Furthermore, the adaptive immune system of cartilaginous fishes is unusual: it lacks the canonical CD4 co-receptor and most transcription factors, cytokines and cytokine receptors related to the CD4 lineage, despite the presence of polymorphic major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. It thus presents a new model for understanding the origin of adaptive immunity. Whole-genome analysis of the elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish, shows that it is the slowest evolving of all known vertebrates, lacks critical bone formation genes and has an unusual adaptive immune system. The elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii) is a cartilaginous fish native to the temperate waters off southern Australia and New Zealand, living at depths of 200 to 500 metres and migrating into shallow waters during spring for breeding. The genome sequence is published in this issue of Nature. Comparison with other vertebrate genomes shows that it is the slowest evolving genome of all known vertebrates — coelacanth included. Genome analysis points to an unusual adaptive immune system lacking the CD4 receptor and some associated cytokines, indicating that cartilaginous fishes possess a primordial gnathostome adaptive immune system. Also absent are genes encoding secreted calcium-binding phosphoproteins, in line with the absence of bone in cartilaginous fish."
https://openalex.org/W1982934377,"UvrD helicase is required for nucleotide excision repair, although its role in this process is not well defined. Here we show that Escherichia coli UvrD binds RNA polymerase during transcription elongation and, using its helicase/translocase activity, forces RNA polymerase to slide backward along DNA. By inducing backtracking, UvrD exposes DNA lesions shielded by blocked RNA polymerase, allowing nucleotide excision repair enzymes to gain access to sites of damage. Our results establish UvrD as a bona fide transcription elongation factor that contributes to genomic integrity by resolving conflicts between transcription and DNA repair complexes. Furthermore, we show that the elongation factor NusA cooperates with UvrD in coupling transcription to DNA repair by promoting backtracking and recruiting nucleotide excision repair enzymes to exposed lesions. Because backtracking is a shared feature of all cellular RNA polymerases, we propose that this mechanism enables RNA polymerases to function as global DNA damage scanners in bacteria and eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2145071690,"Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP), extracts from the wolfberries, are protective to retina after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). The antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated antioxidant pathway plays an important role in maintaining the redox status of the retina. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), combined with potent AREs in its promoter, is a highly effective therapeutic target for the protection against neurodegenerative diseases, including I/R-induced retinal damage. The aim of our present study was to investigate whether the protective effect of LBP after I/R damage was mediated via activation of the Nrf2/HO-1-antioxidant pathway in the retina. Retinal I/R was induced by an increase in intraocular pressure to 130 mm Hg for 60 minutes. Prior to the induction of ischemia, rats were orally treated with either vehicle (PBS) or LBP (1 mg/kg) once a day for 1 week. For specific experiments, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP, 20 mg/kg), an HO-1 inhibitor, was intraperitoneally administered at 24 h prior to ischemia. The protective effects of LBP were evaluated by quantifying ganglion cell and amacrine cell survival, and by measuring cell apoptosis in the retinal layers. In addition, HO-1 expression was examined using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses. Cytosolic and nuclear Nrf2 was measured using immunofluorescent staining. LBP treatment significantly increased Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and HO-1 expression in the retina after I/R injury. Increased apoptosis and a decrease in the number of viable cells were observed in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL) in the I/R retina, which were reversed by LBP treatment. The HO-1 inhibitor, ZnPP, diminished the LBP treatment-induced protective effects in the retina after I/R. Taken together, these results suggested that LBP partially exerted its beneficial neuroprotective effects via the activation of Nrf2 and an increase in HO-1 protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W1973022936,"Many DNA sequence variants influence phenotypes by altering gene expression. Our understanding of these variants is limited by sample sizes of current studies and by measurements of mRNA rather than protein abundance. We developed a powerful method for identifying genetic loci that influence protein expression in very large populations of the yeast Saccharomyes cerevisiae. The method measures single-cell protein abundance through the use of green-fluorescent-protein tags. We applied this method to 160 genes and detected many more loci per gene than previous studies. We also observed closer correspondence between loci that influence protein abundance and loci that influence mRNA abundance of a given gene. Most loci cluster at hotspot locations that influence multiple proteins - in some cases, more than half of those examined. The variants that underlie these hotspots have profound effects on the gene regulatory network and provide insights into genetic variation in cell physiology between yeast strains."
https://openalex.org/W2088742011,"Within mammalian cells, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) inhabits a membrane-bound vacuole known as the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). We have recently shown that wild type S. Typhimurium also colonizes the cytosol of epithelial cells. Here we sought to quantify the contribution of cytosolic Salmonella to the total population over a time course of infection in different epithelial cell lines and under conditions of altered vacuolar escape. We found that the lysosomotropic agent, chloroquine, acts on vacuolar, but not cytosolic, Salmonella. After chloroquine treatment, vacuolar bacteria are not transcriptionally active or replicative and appear degraded. Using a chloroquine resistance assay, in addition to digitonin permeabilization, we found that S. Typhimurium lyses its nascent vacuole in numerous epithelial cell lines, albeit with different frequencies, and hyper-replication in the cytosol is also widespread. At later times post-infection, cytosolic bacteria account for half of the total population in some epithelial cell lines, namely HeLa and Caco-2 C2Bbe1. Both techniques accurately measured increased vacuole lysis in epithelial cells upon treatment with wortmannin. By chloroquine resistance assay, we also determined that Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1), but not SPI-2, the virulence plasmid nor the flagellar apparatus, was required for vacuolar escape and cytosolic replication in epithelial cells. Together, digitonin permeabilization and the chloroquine resistance assay will be useful, complementary tools for deciphering the mechanisms of SCV lysis and Salmonella replication in the epithelial cell cytosol."

https://openalex.org/W1982501941,"Intestinal epithelial stem cells (ISCs) are the focus of recent intense study. Current in vitro models rely on supplementation with the Wnt agonist R-spondin1 to support robust growth, ISC self-renewal, and differentiation. Intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) are important supportive cells within the ISC niche. We hypothesized that co-culture with ISEMF enhances the growth of ISCs in vitro and allows for their successful in vivo implantation and engraftment. ISC-containing small intestinal crypts, FACS-sorted single ISCs, and ISEMFs were procured from C57BL/6 mice. Crypts and single ISCs were grown in vitro into enteroids, in the presence or absence of ISEMFs. ISEMFs enhanced the growth of intestinal epithelium in vitro in a proximity-dependent fashion, with co-cultures giving rise to larger enteroids than monocultures. Co-culture of ISCs with supportive ISEMFs relinquished the requirement of exogenous R-spondin1 to sustain long-term growth and differentiation of ISCs. Mono- and co-cultures were implanted subcutaneously in syngeneic mice. Co-culture with ISEMFs proved necessary for successful in vivo engraftment and proliferation of enteroids; implants without ISEMFs did not survive. ISEMF whole transcriptome sequencing and qPCR demonstrated high expression of specific R-spondins, well-described Wnt agonists that supports ISC growth. Specific non-supportive ISEMF populations had reduced expression of R-spondins. The addition of ISEMFs in intestinal epithelial culture therefore recapitulates a critical element of the intestinal stem cell niche and allows for its experimental interrogation and biodesign-driven manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2012178932,"Background Excessive iron accumulation leads to iron toxicity in the brain; however the underlying mechanism is unclear. We investigated the effects of iron overload induced by high iron-diet consumption on brain mitochondrial function, brain synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Iron chelator (deferiprone) and antioxidant (n-acetyl cysteine) effects on iron-overload brains were also studied. Methodology Male Wistar rats were fed either normal diet or high iron-diet consumption for 12 weeks, after which rats in each diet group were treated with vehicle or deferiprone (50 mg/kg) or n-acetyl cysteine (100 mg/kg) or both for another 4 weeks. High iron-diet consumption caused brain iron accumulation, brain mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired brain synaptic plasticity and cognition, blood-brain-barrier breakdown, and brain apoptosis. Although both iron chelator and antioxidant attenuated these deleterious effects, combined therapy provided more robust results. Conclusion In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating that combined iron chelator and anti-oxidant therapy completely restored brain function impaired by iron overload."
https://openalex.org/W1979033746,"The epidermis of terrestrial vertebrates is a stratified epithelium and forms an essential protective barrier. It is continually renewed, with dead corneocytes shed from the surface and replaced from a basal keratinocyte stem cell population. Whilst mouse is the prime model system used for epidermal studies, there is increasing employment of the zebrafish to analyse epidermis development and homeostasis, however the architecture and ontogeny of the epidermis in this system are incompletely described. In particular, it is unclear if adult zebrafish epidermis is derived entirely from the basal epidermal stem cell layer, as in the mouse, or if the most superficial keratinocyte layer is a remnant of the embryonic periderm. Furthermore, a relative paucity of cellular markers and genetic reagents to label and manipulate the basal epidermal stem cell compartment has hampered research. Here we show that the type I keratin, krtt1c19e, is a suitable marker of the basal epidermal layer and identify a krtt1c19e promoter fragment able to drive strong and specific expression in this cell type. Use of this promoter to express an inducible Cre recombinase allowed permanent labelling of basal cells during embryogenesis, and demonstrated that these cells do indeed generate keratinocytes of all strata in the adult epidermis. Further deployment of the Cre-Lox system highlighted the transient nature of the embryonic periderm. We thus show that the epidermis of adult zebrafish, as in the mouse, derives from basal stem cells, further expanding the similarities of epidermal ontogeny across vertebrates. Future use of this promoter will assist genetic analysis of basal keratinocyte biology in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W2065438964,"Background MAPK inhibitors (MAPKi) are active in BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma patients, but the extent of response and progression-free survival (PFS) is variable, and complete responses are rare. We sought to examine the patterns of response and progression in patients treated with targeted therapy. Methods MAPKi-naïve patients treated with combined dabrafenib and trametinib had all metastases ≥5 mm (lymph nodes ≥15 mm in short axis) visible on computed tomography measured at baseline and throughout treatment. Results 24 patients had 135 measured metastases (median 4.5/patient, median diameter 16 mm). Time to best response (median 5.5 mo, range 1.7–20.1 mo), and the degree of best response (median −70%, range +9 to −100%) varied amongst patients. 17% of patients achieved complete response (CR), whereas 53% of metastases underwent CR, including 42% ≥10 mm. Metastases that underwent CR were smaller than non-CR metastases (median 11 vs 20 mm, P<0.001). PFS was variable among patients (median 8.2 mo, range 2.6–18.3 mo), and 50% of patients had disease progression in new metastases only. Only 1% (1/71) of CR-metastases subsequently progressed. Twelve-month overall survival was poorer in those with a more heterogeneous initial response to therapy than less heterogeneous (67% vs 93%, P = 0.009). Conclusion Melanoma response and progression with MAPKi displays marked inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity. Most metastases undergo complete response, yet only a small proportion of patients achieve an overall complete response. Similarly, disease progression often occurs only in a subset of the tumor burden, and often in new metastases alone. Clinical heterogeneity, likely reflecting molecular heterogeneity, remains a barrier to the effective treatment of melanoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2014768150,"Background Elevated plasma levels of IL-1β and IL-18 from patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection indicate a possible activation of inflammasome by HCV. Methodology/Principal Findings To demonstrate whether HCV infection activates the inflammasome, we investigated inflammasome activation from HCV infected hepatic Huh7 cells, or monocytic cells and THP-1 derived macrophages challenged with HCV virions, but no any inflammasome activation was detected in these cells. However, when we transfected HCV genomic RNA into monocytes or macrophages, IL-1β was secreted in a dose-dependent manner. We also detected ASC oligomerization and caspase-1 cleavage in HCV RNA transfected macrophages. Using shRNA-mediated gene silencing or specific inhibitors, we found that HCV RNA-induced IL-1β secretion was dependent on the presence of inflammasome components such as NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1. Furthermore, we also found that RIG-I was dispensable for HCV RNA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was required. Conclusions Our results indicate that HCV RNA activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in a ROS-dependent manner, and RIG-I is not required for this process."
https://openalex.org/W1986114891,"MicroRNAs are single-stranded non-coding RNAs that simultaneously down-modulate the expression of multiple genes post-transcriptionally by binding to the 3′UTRs of target mRNAs. Here we used computational methods to predict microRNAs relevant in breast cancer progression. Specifically, we applied different microRNA target prediction algorithms to various groups of differentially expressed protein-coding genes obtained from four breast cancer datasets. Six potential candidates were identified, among them miR-223, previously described to be highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment and known to be actively transferred into breast cancer cells. To investigate the function of miR-223 in tumorigenesis and to define its molecular mechanism, we overexpressed miR-223 in breast cancer cells in a transient or stable manner. Alternatively we overexpressed miR-223 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts or HEK293 cells and used their conditioned medium to treat tumor cells. With both approaches, we obtained elevated levels of miR-223 in tumor cells and observed decreased migration, increased cell death in anoikis conditions and augmented sensitivity to chemotherapy but no effect on adhesion and proliferation. The analysis of miR-223 predicted targets revealed enrichment in cell death and survival-related genes and in pathways frequently altered in breast cancer. Among these genes, we showed that protein levels for STAT5A, ITGA3 and NRAS were modulated by miR-223. In addition, we proved that STAT5A is a direct miR-223 target and highlighted a possible correlation between miR-223 and STAT5A in migration and chemotherapy response. Our investigation revealed that a computational analysis of cancer gene expression datasets can be a relevant tool to identify microRNAs involved in cancer progression and that miR-223 has a prominent role in breast malignancy that could potentially be exploited therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W2048060464,"Introduction With the progression of substance dependence, drug cue-related brain activation is thought to shift from motivational towards habit pathways. However, a direct association between cue-induced brain activation and dependence duration has not yet been shown. We therefore examined the relationship between alcohol cue-reactivity in the brain, cue-induced subjective craving and alcohol dependence duration and severity. Since alcohol dependence is highly comorbid with depression/anxiety, which may modulate brain responses to alcohol cues, we also examined the relation between comorbid depression/anxiety and cue-reactivity. Methods We compared 30 alcohol dependent patients with 15 healthy controls and 15 depression/anxiety patients during a visual alcohol cue-reactivity task using functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenated level-dependent responses and subjective craving as outcomes. Within the alcohol dependent group we correlated cue-reactivity with alcohol dependence severity and duration, with cue-induced craving and with depression/anxiety levels. Results Alcohol dependent patients showed greater cue-reactivity in motivational brain pathways and stronger subjective craving than depression/anxiety patients and healthy controls. Depression/anxiety was not associated with cue-reactivity, but depression severity in alcohol dependent patients was positively associated with craving. Within alcohol dependence, longer duration of alcohol dependence was associated with stronger cue-related activation of the posterior putamen, a structure involved in habits, whereas higher alcohol dependence severity was associated with lower cue-reactivity in the anterior putamen, an area implicated in goal-directed behavior preceding habit formation. Conclusion Cue-reactivity in alcohol dependence is not modulated by comorbid depression or anxiety. More importantly, the current data confirm the hypothesis of a ventral to dorsal striatal shift of learning processes with longer dependence duration, which could underlie increasingly habitual substance use with progressing substance dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2053658327,"Atherosclerosis is a major cause of cerebrovascular disease. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in matrix degradation within the atherosclerotic lesion leading to plaque destabilization and ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that MMP-7 could be involved in this process.Plasma levels of MMP-7 were measured in 182 consecutive patients with moderate (50-69%) or severe (≥70%) internal carotid artery stenosis, and in 23 healthy controls. The mRNA levels of MMP-7 were measured in atherosclerotic carotid plaques with different symptomatology, and based on its localization to macrophages, the in vitro regulation of MMP-7 in primary monocytes was examined.Our major findings were (i) Patients with carotid atherosclerosis had markedly increased plasma levels of MMP-7 compared to healthy controls, with particularly high levels in patients with recent symptoms (i.e., within the last 2 months). (ii) A similar pattern was found within carotid plaques with markedly higher mRNA levels of MMP-7 than in non-atherosclerotic vessels. Particularly high protein levels of MMP-7 levels were found in those with the most recent symptoms. (iii) Immunhistochemistry showed that MMP-7 was localized to macrophages, and in vitro studies in primary monocytes showed that the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α in combination with hypoxia and oxidized LDL markedly increased MMP-7 expression. (iv) During the follow-up of patients with carotid atherosclerosis, high plasma levels of MMP-7 were independently associated with total mortality.Our findings suggest that MMP-7 could contribute to plaque instability in carotid atherosclerosis, potentially involving macrophage-related mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2037206608,"Systemic treatment of patients with early-stage cancers attempts to eradicate occult metastatic disease to prevent recurrence and increased morbidity. However, prediction of recurrence from an analysis of the primary tumor is limited because disseminated cancer cells only represent a small subset of the primary lesion. Here we analyze the expression of circulating microRNAs (miRs) in serum obtained pre-surgically from patients with early stage colorectal cancers. Groups of five patients with and without disease recurrence were used to identify an informative panel of circulating miRs using quantitative PCR of genome-wide miR expression as well as a set of published candidate miRs. A panel of six informative miRs (miR-15a, mir-103, miR-148a, miR-320a, miR-451, miR-596) was derived from this analysis and evaluated in a separate validation set of thirty patients. Hierarchical clustering of the expression levels of these six circulating miRs and Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of disease recurrence of early stage colon cancer can be predicted by this panel of miRs that are measurable in the circulation at the time of diagnosis (P = 0.0026; Hazard Ratio 5.4; 95% CI of 1.9 to 15)."
https://openalex.org/W2062955826,"The growth and guidance of many axons in the developing nervous system require Netrin-mediated activation of Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and other still unknown signaling cues. Commissural axon guidance defects are more severe in DCC mutant mice than Netrin-1 mutant mice, suggesting additional DCC activating signals besides Netrin-1 are involved in proper axon growth. Here we report that interaction screens on extracellular protein microarrays representing over 1,000 proteins uniquely identified Cerebellin 4 (CBLN4), a member of the C1q-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, and Netrin-1 as extracellular DCC-binding partners. Immunofluorescence and radio-ligand binding studies demonstrate that Netrin-1 competes with CBLN4 binding at an overlapping site within the membrane-proximal fibronectin domains (FN) 4–6 of DCC and binds with ∼5-fold higher affinity. CBLN4 also binds to the DCC homolog, Neogenin-1 (NEO1), but with a lower affinity compared to DCC. CBLN4-null mice did not show a defect in commissural axons of the developing spinal cord but did display a transient increase in the number of wandering axons in the brachial plexus, consistent with a role in axon guidance. Overall, the data solidifies CBLN4 as a bona fide DCC ligand and strengthens its implication in axon guidance."

However, there is limited data concerning the replicon types of blaOXA-58-carrying plasmids and the genetic context surrounding blaOXA-58 in Acinetobacter spp. in China.Twelve non-duplicated blaOXA-58-harboring Acinetobacter spp. isolates were collected from six hospitals in five different cities between 2005 and 2010. The molecular epidemiology of the isolates was carried out using PFGE and multilocus sequence typing. Carbapenemase-encoding genes and plasmid replicase genes were identified by PCR. The genetic location of blaOXA-58 was analyzed using S1-nuclease method. Plasmid conjugation and electrotransformation were performed to evaluate the transferability of blaOXA-58-harboring plasmids. The genetic structure surrounding blaOXA-58 was determined by cloning experiments. The twelve isolates included two Acinetobacter pittii isolates (belong to one pulsotype), three Acinetobacter nosocomialis isolates (belong to two pulsotypes) and seven Acinetobacter baumannii isolates (belong to two pulsotypes/sequence types). A. baumannii ST91 was found to be a potential multidrug resistant risk clone carrying both blaOXA-58 and blaOXA-23. blaOXA-58 located on plasmids varied from ca. 52 kb to ca. 143 kb. All plasmids can be electrotransformed to A. baumannii recipient, but were untypeable by the current replicon typing scheme. A novel plasmid replicase named repAci10 was identified in blaOXA-58-harboring plasmids of two A. pittii isolates, three A. nosocomialis isolates and two A. baumannii isolates. Four kinds of genetic contexts of blaOXA-58 were identified. The transformants of plasmids with structure of IS6 family insertion sequence (ISOur1, IS1008 or IS15)-ΔISAba3-like element-blaOXA-58 displayed carbapenem nonsusceptible, while others with structure of intact ISAba3-like element-blaOXA-58 were carbapenem susceptible.The study revealed the unique features of blaOXA-58-carrying plasmids in Acinetobacter spp. in China, which were different from that of Acinetobacter spp. found in European countries. The diversity of the genetic contexts of blaOXA-58 contributed to various antibiotics resistance profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2001748768,"The prion protein (PrP) is implicated in the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs), which comprise a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases affecting humans and other mammals. Conversion of cellular PrP (PrPC) into the scrapie form (PrPSc) is the hallmark of TSEs. Once formed, PrPSc aggregates and catalyzes PrPC misfolding into new PrPSc molecules. Although many compounds have been shown to inhibit the conversion process, so far there is no effective therapy for TSEs. Besides, most of the previously evaluated compounds failed in vivo due to poor pharmacokinetic profiles. In this work we propose a combined in vitro/in silico approach to screen for active anti-prion compounds presenting acceptable drugability and pharmacokinetic parameters. A diverse panel of aromatic compounds was screened in neuroblastoma cells persistently infected with PrPSc (ScN2a) for their ability to inhibit PK-resistant PrP (PrPRes) accumulation. From ∼200 compounds, 47 were effective in decreasing the accumulation of PrPRes in ScN2a cells. Pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties were predicted in silico, allowing us to obtain estimates of relative blood brain barrier permeation and mutagenicity. MTT reduction assays showed that most of the active compounds were non cytotoxic. Compounds that cleared PrPRes from ScN2a cells, were non-toxic in the MTT assay, and presented a good pharmacokinetic profile were investigated for their ability to inhibit aggregation of an amyloidogenic PrP peptide fragment (PrP109–149). Molecular docking results provided structural models and binding affinities for the interaction between PrP and the most promising compounds. In summary, using this combined in vitro/in silico approach we have identified new small organic anti-scrapie compounds that decrease the accumulation of PrPRes in ScN2a cells, inhibit the aggregation of a PrP peptide, and possess pharmacokinetic characteristics that support their drugability. These compounds are attractive candidates for prion disease therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2074189037,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 4A3 (PTP4A3) is highly expressed in multiple human cancers and is hypothesized to have a critical, albeit poorly defined, role in the formation of experimental tumors in mice.

In particular, PTP4A3 is expressed in the tumor vasculature and has been proposed to be a direct target of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in endothelial cells. We now provide the first in vivo experimental evidence that PTP4A3 participates in VEGF signaling and contributes to the process of pathological angiogenesis. Colon tumor tissue isolated from Ptp4a3-null mice revealed reduced tumor microvessel density compared with wild type controls. Additionally, vascular cells derived from Ptp4a3-null tissues exhibited decreased invasiveness in an ex vivo wound healing assay. When primary endothelial cells were isolated and cultured in vitro, Ptp4a3-null cells displayed greatly reduced migration compared with wild type cells. Exposure to VEGF led to an increase in Src phosphorylation in wild type endothelial cells, a response that was completely ablated in Ptp4a3-null cells. In loss-of-function studies, reduced VEGF-mediated migration was also observed when human endothelial cells were treated with a small molecule inhibitor of PTP4A3.

High gene expression levels of Ptp4a3, as well as its closely related family members Ptp4a1 and Ptp4a2, are often associated with tumor growth and metastasis of many human cancer types (3.Stephens B.J.

Furthermore, poor patient prognosis and increased tumor invasiveness are commonly observed in many different malignancies expressing high levels of PTP4A3 (4.Radke I. Götte M. Kersting C. Mattsson B.

Although the specific PTP4A substrates have remained elusive, several downstream signaling pathways have been proposed including: PI3K/AKT (6.Wang H. Quah S.Y. Dong J.M. Manser E. Tang J.P. Zeng Q.

Considering the multitude of proposed signaling effectors, it is likely that the function of PTP4A3 is tightly regulated by cell type and specific cues from the extracellular environment. protein-tyrosine phosphatase 4A3 microvascular endothelial growth medium human microvascular endothelial cell. Preclinical and clinical findings have suggested that in addition to a role in cancer cells, PTP4A3 may be fundamentally involved in tumor angiogenesis. High Ptp4a3 gene expression levels are observed in tumor endothelium, pointing to its potential involvement in the pathological angiogenesis required for tumor progression as well as metastatic colonization (10.St Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. PRL-3 expression in metastatic cancers.Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 5607-5615PubMed Google Scholar). Ptp4a3 is increased 10-fold in the vasculature of invasive breast tumors relative to normal vasculature (12.Parker B.S. Argani P. Cook B.P. Liangfeng H. Chartrand S.D. Zhang M. Saha S. Bardelli A. Jiang Y. St Martin T.B. Nacht M. Teicher B.A. Klinger K.W. Sukumar S. Madden S.L. Alterations in vascular gene expression in invasive breast carcinoma.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7857-7866Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). High PTP4A3 protein levels are also observed in developing heart tissue and blood vessels but not in their mature forms, suggesting a general role for PTP4A3 in cardiovascular system development (13.Guo K. Li J. Wang H. Osato M. Tang J.P. Quah S.Y. Gan B.Q. Zeng Q. PRL-3 initiates tumor angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9625-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is a multifaceted process dependent on a complex network of growth factors and signaling pathways. Ectopic overexpression of PTP4A3 increases tube formation by endothelial cells, a phenotype associated with angiogenesis (14.Rouleau C. Roy A. St Martin T. Dufault M.R. Boutin P. Liu D. Zhang M. Puorro-Radzwill K. Rulli L. Reczek D. Bagley R. Byrne A. Weber W. Roberts B. Klinger K. Brondyk W. Nacht M. Madden S. Burrier R. Shankara S. Teicher B.A. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase PRL-3 in malignant cells and endothelial cells: expression and function.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas genetic or pharmacological reduction of PTP4A3 expression or activity leads to a decrease in tube formation (15.Xu J. Cao S. Wang L. Xu R. Chen G. Xu Q. VEGF promotes the transcription of the human PRL-3 gene in HUVEC through transcription factor MEF2C.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e27165Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PTP4A3-expressing tumor cells can recruit endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo (13.Guo K. Li J. Wang H. Osato M. Tang J.P. Quah S.Y. Gan B.Q. Zeng Q. PRL-3 initiates tumor angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9625-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a well characterized proangiogenic factor capable of inducing proliferation, migration, and sprouting of endothelial cells and is necessary for the creation of new vasculature. When VEGF binds to its cognate VEGFR2 receptor on endothelial cells, several key pathways that promote angiogenic signaling are activated. Known downstream effectors of VEGF signaling include Src (16.He H. Venema V.J. Gu X. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. Vascular endothelial growth factor signals endothelial cell production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin through flk-1/KDR activation of c-Src.J. Biol.

Huot J. p38 MAP kinase activation by vascular endothelial growth factor mediates actin reorganization and cell migration in human endothelial cells.Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ptp4a3 gene expression in cultured endothelial cells appears to be regulated by VEGF through its VEGFR2 receptor and the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2C (15.Xu J. Cao S. Wang L. Xu R. Chen G. Xu Q. VEGF promotes the transcription of the human PRL-3 gene in HUVEC through transcription factor MEF2C.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e27165Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because of the potential role of PTP4A3 in vascular function during angiogenesis and metastases, we tested the hypothesis that PTP4A3 is a mediator of the angiogenic phenotype of vascular cells in tumor and nontumor microenvironments. Accordingly, blood vessel development was contrasted in experimental colon tumors from wild type and Ptp4a3-null mice using CD31 immunocytochemistry. Aspects of wound repair were quantified in primary murine pulmonary endothelial cells from wild type and Ptp4a3-null mice. Furthermore, the contribution of PTP4A3 to VEGF signaling and its downstream signaling components, notably phosphorylation of Src, was examined. To complement previous siRNA studies (18.Fagerli U.M.

Finally, we documented diminution of in vivo VEGF-mediated vascular permeability in mice lacking PTP4A3. Creation of Ptp4a3 mutant mice, global gene deletion, and colon tumorigenesis experiments were performed as described previously (2.Zimmerman M.W. Homanics G.E. Lazo J.S. Targeted deletion of the metastasis-associated phophatase Ptp4a3 (PRL-3) suppresses murine colon cancer.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e58300Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These mice have been donated to the Jackson Laboratory mutant strain repository (stock 21159). Experimental mice were produced by mating heterozygous breeding pairs, and genotyping was performed by Southern blotting of genomic DNA with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to exon 6 of the Ptp4a3 genomic locus. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the University of Pittsburgh and University of Virginia Animal Care and Use Committees. Mouse blood pressure and cardiovascular output measurements were assayed with the CODA noninvasive tail cuff system (Kent Scientific). An occlusion cuff was placed at the base of the tail, and a volume pressure recording sensor was placed around the tail vein. Blood volume was measured by the differential pressure transducer, which utilizes a volumetric assay to determine blood flow and blood volume. Adult male mice (n = 5/genotype, 8–10 weeks) under normal diet and environmental conditions were used for the experiment. All tail cuff experiments were performed on restrained, conscious mice at approximately the same time of day, and body temperature was controlled with a heat pad at 37 °C. Mice were trained on the equipment daily for 4 consecutive days before experimental data were collected. Cardiovascular statistics for each mouse were determined as the average of at least three measurements taken on day 5. Tissues from four mice per genotype as well as tumors from mice 16 weeks after azoxymethane treatment (2.Zimmerman M.W. Homanics G.E. Lazo J.S. Targeted deletion of the metastasis-associated phophatase Ptp4a3 (PRL-3) suppresses murine colon cancer.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e58300Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (14 wild type and 11 Ptp4a3-null) were isolated and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight at room temperature. Samples were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned onto glass slides. Slides were deparaffinized and antigenicity retrieved by steaming in EDTA, pH 8.0, for 30 min. For the microvessel density assay, an antibody against CD31 (clone M-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a concentration of 1:300 at room temperature overnight. For each colon cancer sample blinded and randomly chosen CD31-stained fields (n = 5/sample) from multiple tumors were imaged, positively stained vessels were counted, and vessel density was determined as a function of tissue area (mm2). Cell and tissue samples were lysed using radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer, protein concentration was quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and experiments were repeated in triplicate. Lysates (30 μg each) were separated using the Novex SDS-PAGE system and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in Odyssey buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) and incubated with primary antibodies overnight followed by secondary fluorescent antibodies according to the manufacturers' instructions. Detection and signal quantification were performed with an Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR Biosciences). We used the following commercially available primary antibodies: PTP4A3 clone 318 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); VEGFR2, p-Src (Tyr-416), Src, p-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), ERK1/2, FAK, p-FAK (Tyr-576/Tyr-577), paxillin, p-paxillin (Tyr-118) (Cell Signaling Technology); β-tubulin (Cedarlane Laboratories). The phosphorylation status of VEGFR2 was measured using an ELISA-based antibody array according to the manufacturer's protocol (Full Moon Biosciences). Whole protein lysates (60 μg) from wild type and Ptp4a3-null endothelial cells were biotinylated and bound to individual antibody array slides. Secondary fluorescence was performed with Cy3-labeled streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences), and slides were shipped to the manufacturer for imaging and data analysis. Relative signal intensities were determined by comparing Ptp4a3-null median-centered values with wild type. Skeletal muscle tissue biopsies (pectoralis major muscle) were isolated from mice (n = 3/genotype, male, 6–8 weeks), placed into prewarmed microvascular endothelial growth medium (EGM-MV; Lonza) and cut into small (<2 mm) pieces. Collagen matrix was prepared with type I collagen containing Medium 199, l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, sodium bicarbonate, and NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich) as reported previously (21.Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Thrombospondin-1 inhibits endothelial cell responses to nitric oxide in a cGMP-dependent manner.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Tissue pieces were embedded into the matrix in individual wells (n = 14–33/mouse) of a 96-well tissue culture plate and overlaid with EGM-MV. The samples were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 72 h. For each well, the distance from the tissue edge to the furthest migrating vascular cell was measured under a brightfield microscope with a total of 69 and 84 determinations performed from wild type and null tissues, respectively. Mouse primary endothelial cells were isolated from pulmonary tissue (n = 12 mice/genotype) as described previously (22.Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Kapralova V.I. Wasserloos K. Mosher M. Epperly M.W. Greenberger J.S. Pitt B.R. Kagan V.E. Oxidative lipidomics of γ-radiation-induced lung injury: mass spectrometric characterization of cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine peroxidation.Radiat. Res. 2011; 175: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on a collagen matrix in 2% O2, 5% CO2, 93% N2 in a Coy hypoxic glove box/chamber (Coy Laboratories, Inc.) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 0.2% retinal derived growth factor (ENDOGRO; Vec Technologies), 10 units/ml heparin, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acid supplement (Invitrogen), and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Commercially available human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs; ScienCell or Lonza) were cultured in EGM-2 under normoxic conditions (5% CO2) in collagen-coated tissue culture flasks. The primary growth factor components of EGM-2, namely IGF, EGF, FGF, and VEGF, were purchased from Lonza and used at the manufacturer's recommended concentrations. The PTP4A3 inhibitor BR-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was solubilized in tissue culture grade dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) and added to HMVECs at the indicated concentrations in 6- or 12-well plates. Lysates from BR-1-treated HMVECs were collected following 24 h of treatment. Primary mouse endothelial cells and HMVECs were grown to confluence in collagen-coated 12-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences). Each well (n = 6/genotype or treatment) was scratched longitudinally with a pipette tip and incubated for 16 h to allow gap closure. Cell migration distance was determined by measuring the gap distance between cell fronts following inward migration. Adult male mice (n = 6–8/genotype, 8–12 weeks) under normal diet and environmental conditions were injected intravenously with Evans blue dye (100 μl of a 1% solution in 0.9% NaCl). After 20 min, 400 ng of recombinant murine VEGF (Peprotech) dissolved in 20 μl of PBS and 0.1% BSA or 20 μl of vehicle alone was injected intradermally into the shaved right or left flank of the mouse, respectively. After 20 min, the animals were euthanized and perfused with 10 ml of saline via the left ventricle. The area of skin containing the injection site was removed using a 5-mm biopsy punch (Miltex). Evans blue dye was extracted from the skin by incubation with 20 μl of formamide for 24 h at 57 °C, and the absorbance of the extracted dye was measured at 620 nm in triplicate in a 96-well plate. Statistical analysis of cell and tissue based assays, as well as Western blot quantification, was analyzed using the two-tailed Student's t test. For all experiments significance was defined as p < 0.05. High levels of PTP4A3 expression have previously been observed in fetal heart and the immature blood vessels of tumor tissue (13.Guo K. Li J. Wang H. Osato M. Tang J.P. Quah S.Y. Gan B.Q. Zeng Q. PRL-3 initiates tumor angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9625-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Western blot assay on mouse tissue samples revealed high PTP4A3 protein in lysates from fetal heart and adult spleen, whereas detectable levels were also found in adult heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, lung, brain, and fetal intestine (Fig. 1A). As expected, fetal heart tissue (from whole heart lysates) exhibited the highest level of PTP4A3 protein in the tissues analyzed. Compared with adult heart and skeletal muscle tissues (pectoralis major), fetal heart had 5-fold greater protein levels (Fig. 1B). When fetal and adult heart tissues from wild type and Ptp4a3-null mice were compared, however, these tissues appeared overtly normal and healthy (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining for the endothelial cell marker CD31 revealed similar blood vessel density in skeletal muscle tissue in both genotypes (Fig. 1C) under basal conditions consistent with our previous observation of no significant gross abnormalities in the mice (2.Zimmerman M.W. Homanics G.E. Lazo J.S. Targeted deletion of the metastasis-associated phophatase Ptp4a3 (PRL-3) suppresses murine colon cancer.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e58300Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We next examined cardiovascular function in adult wild type and knock-out mice. Blood pressure, heart rate, and tissue blood flow were measured using a noninvasive tail cuff system. Mice were acclimated to the assay system for four preliminary trials throughout the course of 1 week. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly different between genotypes (Fig. 1, D and E). Tail blood flow rate also was unaffected by the loss of PTP4A3 (Fig. 1F). Collectively, these results suggest that loss of PTP4A3 activity does not overtly affect heart and vessel development and is not required for basal function of the cardiovascular system in adult mice under nonstressed laboratory conditions. Expression of human PTP4A3 has been reported in tumor endothelium (10.St Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B.

Alterations in vascular gene expression in invasive breast carcinoma.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7857-7866Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and potentially could contribute to the formation of the extensive vascular network necessary for tumor growth. Furthermore, PTP4A3-expressing tumor cells have the ability to functionally recruit endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo (13.Guo K. Li J. Wang H. Osato M. Tang J.P. Quah S.Y. Gan B.Q. Zeng Q. PRL-3 initiates tumor angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9625-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mice deficient for PTP4A3 develop fewer tumors in a carcinogenesis model of colitis-associated colon cancer driven by azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate (2.Zimmerman M.W. Homanics G.E. Lazo J.S. Targeted deletion of the metastasis-associated phophatase Ptp4a3 (PRL-3) suppresses murine colon cancer.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e58300Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The adenocarcinomas that form in the wild type and Ptp4a3-null mice do not exhibit gross histological differences (2.Zimmerman M.W. Homanics G.E. Lazo J.S. Targeted deletion of the metastasis-associated phophatase Ptp4a3 (PRL-3) suppresses murine colon cancer.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e58300Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We found that both wild type and knock-out tumors were vascularized as evidenced by CD31-positive staining of endothelium in both genotypes (Fig. 2, A and B). Ptp4a3-null tumors, however, had a reduced microvessel presence compared with tumors from the wild type mice, which was evident when the tissues were examined under higher magnification (Fig. 2, C and D). On average, microvessel density was decreased 30% in Ptp4a3-null tissue compared with wild type (Fig. 2E). Because of inherent skewness of vessel density in autochthonous-growing tumors (23.Thompson H.J. McGinley J.N. Knott K.K. Spoelstra N.S. Wolfe P. Vascular density profile of rat mammary carcinomas induced by 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea: implications for the investigation of angiogenesis.Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we also performed log transformation of the data set and continued to observe a statistically significant (p = 0.001) difference between the tumors from wild type and PTP4A3-null mice. These findings support a critical role for PTP4A3 in the development of the tumor vasculature in this mouse model of colon cancer. Examination of tumor angiogenesis in vivo is complex because of inherent variability in vascular density but also due to differences in intratumor and extratumor vasculature and vessel size (23.Thompson H.J. McGinley J.N. Knott K.K. Spoelstra N.S. Wolfe P. Vascular density profile of rat mammary carcinomas induced by 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea: implications for the investigation of angiogenesis.Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24.Preusser M.

Therefore we more precisely examined the angiogenic phenotype of vascular cells from wild type and Ptp4a3-null mice. An ex vivo invasion assay was implemented using skeletal muscle tissue biopsies that were capable of producing outgrowth of vascular cells in response to external stimuli. Tissue samples were embedded in a collagen matrix containing microvascular endothelial growth medium, and vascular cell invasion was determined after 72 h (Fig. 3, A and B). The resulting outgrowth of cells into the matrix has been commonly used to measure capacity for wound healing or angiogenesis (21.Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Thrombospondin-1 inhibits endothelial cell responses to nitric oxide in a cGMP-dependent manner.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), although the migrating cells may not be exclusively endothelial in origin. When examined under higher magnification, the morphology of invasive cells in the three-dimensional matrix became apparent (Fig. 3C). Compared with wild type tissue, Ptp4a3-null samples produced a reduction in outgrowth as measured by the distance from the solid tissue to the farthest invading cell. The relative invasion distance after incubation for 72 h was 20% less in Ptp4a3 knock-out cells compared with wild type cells (Fig. 3D). This result suggested that PTP4A3 was a contributing factor to vascular cell invasiveness that is important during angiogenesis. The cellular function of PTP4A3 was further examined with cultured pulmonary endothelium from adult wild type and Ptp4a3-null mice. Cells were cultured, and purity was assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell migration was measured using an in vitro wound healing assay in which endothelial cells were grown to confluence and a longitudinal gap was created. These cells were incubated for 16 h to permit gap closure via endothelial migrati"
https://openalex.org/W2134694260,"We studied the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice model because it develops autoimmune diabetes that resembles human type 1 diabetes. In diabetic mice, urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was ten-fold increased at an “early stage” of diabetes, and twenty-fold increased at a “later stage” (21 and 40 days, respectively after diabetes diagnosis) as compared to non-obese resistant controls. In NOD Diabetic mice, glomerular enlargement, increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increased blood pressure were observed in the early stage. In the late stage, NOD Diabetic mice developed mesangial expansion and reduced podocyte number. Circulating and urine ACE2 activity were markedly increased both, early and late in Diabetic mice. Insulin administration prevented albuminuria, markedly reduced GFR, blood pressure, and glomerular enlargement in the early stage; and prevented mesangial expansion and the reduced podocyte number in the late stage of diabetes. The increase in serum and urine ACE2 activity was normalized by insulin administration at the early and late stages of diabetes in Diabetic mice. We conclude that the Diabetic mice develops features of early kidney disease, including albuminuria and a marked increase in GFR. ACE2 activity is increased starting at an early stage in both serum and urine. Moreover, these alterations can be completely prevented by the chronic administration of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2061443367,"The relevance of tumor microenvironment for the development and progression of tumor cells in hematological malignancies has been extensively reported. Identification of factors involved in the information exchange between the malignant cells and the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and the knowledge on their functioning may provide important information to eliminate leukemic cells from protective BM niches. We evaluated changes in BM-MSCs obtained from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at different times in the course of disease. Whereas ALL-MSCs did not exhibit phenotypic changes compared to BM-derived MSCs isolated from healthy donors, they exhibited increased adipogenic capacity. In addition, the viability of healthy CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors was significantly reduced when co-cultured with ALL-MSCs. ALL-MSCs grow less efficiently, although gradually recover normal growth with treatment. Accordingly, proliferation is particularly low in MSCs obtained at diagnosis and in the first days of treatment (+15 days), recovering to control levels after 35 days of treatment. Correlating these results with bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) production, a molecule demonstrated to affect MSC biology, we found higher production of BMP4 in ALL-MSCs derived from patients over the course of disease but not in those free of leukemia. However, no significant differences in the expression of different members of the BMP4 signaling pathway were observed. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between high levels of BMP4 production in the cultures and MSC proliferation was found, as observed in MSCs derived from patients at diagnosis that produce high BMP4 levels. In addition, co-culturing ALL-MSC with the REH leukemia cell line, but not CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, powerfully enhanced BMP4 production, suggesting an intimate crosstalk among ALL-MSCs isolated from BM colonized by ALL cells that presumably also occurs in situ conditions. Our data may support the participation of BMP4 in BM niche, but the mechanism remains to be elucidated."

All patients were accordingly examined at 7 Tesla and 1.5 Tesla MRI utilizing dedicated head coils. The following sequences were obtained: 7 Tesla TOF MRA, 1.5 Tesla TOF MRA and 7 Tesla non-contrast enhanced MPRAGE. Image analysis was performed by two radiologists with regard to delineation of aneurysm features (dome, neck, parent vessel), presence of artifacts, vessel-tissue-contrast and overall image quality. Interobserver accordance and intermethod comparisons were calculated by kappa coefficient and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient.A total of 20 intracranial aneurysms were detected in 16 patients, with two patients showing multiple aneurysms (n = 2, n = 4). Out of 20 intracranial aneurysms, 14 aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation and 6 aneurysms in the posterior circulation. 7 Tesla MPRAGE imaging was superior over 1.5 and 7 Tesla TOF MRA in the assessment of all considered aneurysm and image quality features (e.g. image quality: mean MPRAGE7T: 5.0; mean TOF7T: 4.3; mean TOF1.5T: 4.3). Ratings for 7 Tesla TOF MRA were equal or higher over 1.5 Tesla TOF MRA for all assessed features except for artifact delineation (mean TOF7T: 4.3; mean TOF1.5T 4.4). Interobserver accordance was good to excellent for most ratings.7 Tesla MPRAGE imaging demonstrated its superiority in the detection and assessment of UIA as well as overall imaging features, offering excellent interobserver accordance and highest scores for all ratings. Hence, it may bear the potential to serve as a high-quality diagnostic tool for pretherapeutic assessment and follow-up of untreated UIA."
https://openalex.org/W2031053524,"Background Volatile anesthetics are widely used in pediatric anesthesia but their potential neurotoxicity raise significant concerns regarding sequelae after anesthesia. However, whether physiological disturbance during anesthetic exposure contributes to such side effects remains unknown. The aim of the current study is to compare the neurotoxic effects of isoflurane and sevoflurane in 14 day old rat pups under spontaneous breathing or ventilated conditions. Methods Postnatal 14 day rats were assigned to one of five groups: 1) spontaneous breathing (SB) + room air (control, n = 17); 2) SB + isoflurane (n = 35); 3) SB + sevoflurane (n = 37); 4) mechanical ventilation (MV) + isoflurane (n = 29); 5) MV + sevoflurane (n = 32). Anesthetized animal received either 1.7% isoflurane or 2.4% seveoflurane for 4 hours. Arterial blood gases and blood pressure were monitored in the anesthetized groups. Neurodegeneration in the CA3 region of hippocampus was assessed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated DNA nick-end labeling immediately after exposure. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated with the Morris water maze in other cohorts 14 days after experiments. Results Most rats in the SB groups developed physiological disturbance whereas ventilated rats did not but become hyperglycemic. Mortality from anesthesia in the SB groups was significantly higher than that in the MV groups. Cell death in the SB but not MV groups was significantly higher than controls. SB + anesthesia groups performed worse on the Morris water maze behavioral test, but no deficits were found in the MV group compared with the controls. Conclusions These findings could suggest that physiological disturbance induced by isoflurane or sevoflurane anesthesia may also contribute to their neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2040701450,"Cascading failures constitute an important vulnerability of interconnected systems. Here we focus on the study of such failures on networks in which the connectivity of nodes is constrained by geographical distance. Specifically, we use random geometric graphs as representative examples of such spatial networks, and study the properties of cascading failures on them in the presence of distributed flow. The key finding of this study is that the process of cascading failures is non-self-averaging on spatial networks, and thus, aggregate inferences made from analyzing an ensemble of such networks lead to incorrect conclusions when applied to a single network, no matter how large the network is. We demonstrate that this lack of self-averaging disappears with the introduction of a small fraction of long-range links into the network. We simulate the well studied preemptive node removal strategy for cascade mitigation and show that it is largely ineffective in the case of spatial networks. We introduce an altruistic strategy designed to limit the loss of network nodes in the event of a cascade triggering failure and show that it performs better than the preemptive strategy. Finally, we consider a real-world spatial network viz. a European power transmission network and validate that our findings from the study of random geometric graphs are also borne out by simulations of cascading failures on the empirical network."
https://openalex.org/W2033706929,"Epigenetic processes–including DNA methylation–are increasingly seen as having a fundamental role in chronic diseases like cancer. DNA methylation patterns offer a route to develop prognostic measures based directly on DNA measurements, rather than less-stable RNA measurements. A novel DNA methylation-based measure of the co-ordinated interactive behaviour of genes is developed, in a network context. It is shown that this measure reflects well the co-regulatory behaviour linked to gene expression (at the mRNA level) over the same network interactions. This measure, defined for pairs of genes in a single patient/sample, associates with overall survival outcome independent of known prognostic clinical features, in several independent data sets relating to different cancer types. In total, more than half a billion CpGs in over 1600 samples, taken from nine different cancer entities, are analysed. It is found that groups of gene-pair interactions which associate significantly with survival identify statistically significant subnetwork modules. Many of these subnetwork modules are shown to be biologically relevant by strong correlation with pre-defined gene sets, such as immune function, wound healing, mitochondrial function and MAP-kinase signalling. In particular, the wound healing module corresponds to an increase in co-ordinated interactive behaviour between genes for worse prognosis, and the immune module corresponds to a decrease in co-ordinated interactive behaviour between genes for worse prognosis. This measure has great potential for defining DNA-based cancer biomarkers. Such biomarkers could naturally be developed further, by drawing on the rapidly expanding knowledge base of network science."

Changes in the extracellular space induced by cell swelling in response to the neural activity enable the in vivo characterization of cerebral microstructure by measuring the water diffusivity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To study the diurnal microstructural alterations of human brain, fifteen right-handed healthy adult subjects were recruited for DTI studies in two repeated sessions (8∶30 AM and 8∶30 PM) within a 24-hour interval. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial (λ//) and radial diffusivity (λ⊥) were compared pixel by pixel between the sessions for each subject. Significant increased morning measurements in FA, ADC, λ// and λ⊥ were seen in a wide range of brain areas involving frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. Prominent evening dominant λ⊥ (18.58%) was detected in the right inferior temporal and ventral fusiform gyri. AM-PM variation of λ⊥ was substantially left side hemisphere dominant (p<0.05), while no hemispheric preference was observed for the same analysis for ADC (p = 0.77), λ// (p = 0.08) or FA (p = 0.25). The percentage change of ADC, λ//, λ⊥, and FA were 1.59%, 2.15%, 1.20% and 2.84%, respectively, for brain areas without diurnal diffusivity contrast. Microstructural variations may function as the substrates of the phasic neural activities in correspondence to the environment adaptation in a light-dark cycle. This research provided a baseline for researches in neuroscience, sleep medicine, psychological and psychiatric disorders, and necessitates that diurnal effect should be taken into account in following up studies using diffusion tensor quantities."
https://openalex.org/W2096883862,"Bone mass is maintained by osteoclasts that resorb bone and osteoblasts that promote matrix deposition and mineralization. Bone homeostasis is altered in chronic inflammation as well as in post-menopausal loss of estrogen, which favors osteoclast activity that leads to osteoporosis. The MAPK p38α is a key regulator of bone loss and p38 inhibitors preserve bone mass by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. p38 function is regulated by two upstream MAPK kinases, namely MKK3 and MKK6. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of MKK3- or MKK6-deficiency on osteoclastogenesis in vitro and on bone loss in ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in mice. We demonstrated that MKK3 but not MKK6, regulates osteoclast differentiation from bone marrow cells in vitro. Expression of NFATc1, a master transcription factor in osteoclastogenesis, is decreased in cells lacking MKK3 but not MKK6. Expression of osteoclast-specific genes Cathepsin K, osteoclast-associated receptor and MMP9, was inhibited in MKK3-/- cells. The effect of MKK-deficiency on ovariectomy-induced bone loss was then evaluated in female WT, MKK3-/- and MKK6-/- mice by micro-CT analysis. Bone loss was partially inhibited in MKK3-/- as well as MKK6-/- mice, despite normal osteoclastogenesis in MKK6-/- cells. This correlated with the lower osteoclast numbers in the MKK-deficient ovariectomized mice. These studies suggest that MKK3 and MKK6 differentially regulate bone loss due to estrogen withdrawal. MKK3 directly mediates osteoclastogenesis while MKK6 likely contributes to pro-inflammatory cytokine production that promotes osteoclast formation."
https://openalex.org/W2146604272,"Typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are required to remove hydrogen peroxide from several different cellular compartments. Their activity can be regulated by hyperoxidation and consequent inactivation of the active-site peroxidatic cysteine. Here we developed a simple assay to quantify the hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxins. Hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxins can only occur efficiently in the presence of a recycling system, usually involving thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. We demonstrate that there is a marked difference in the sensitivity of the endoplasmic reticulum-localized peroxiredoxin to hyperoxidation compared with either the cytosolic or mitochondrial enzymes. Each enzyme is equally sensitive to hyperoxidation in the presence of a robust recycling system. Our results demonstrate that peroxiredoxin IV recycling in the endoplasmic reticulum is much less efficient than in the cytosol or mitochondria, leading to the protection of peroxiredoxin IV from hyperoxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2082951494,"Copy number variations (CNVs) are one of the main sources of variability in the human genome. Many CNVs are associated with various diseases including cardiovascular disease. In addition to hybridization-based methods, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are increasingly used for CNV discovery. However, respective computational methods applicable to NGS data are still limited. We developed a novel CNV calling method based on outlier detection applicable to small cohorts, which is of particular interest for the discovery of individual CNVs within families, de novo CNVs in trios and/or small cohorts of specific phenotypes like rare diseases. Approximately 7,000 rare diseases are currently known, which collectively affect ∼6% of the population. For our method, we applied the Dixon's Q test to detect outliers and used a Hidden Markov Model for their assessment. The method can be used for data obtained by exome and targeted resequencing. We evaluated our outlier-based method in comparison to the CNV calling tool CoNIFER using eight HapMap exome samples and subsequently applied both methods to targeted resequencing data of patients with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease. In both the HapMap samples and the TOF cases, our method is superior to CoNIFER, such that it identifies more true positive CNVs. Called CNVs in TOF cases were validated by qPCR and HapMap CNVs were confirmed with available array-CGH data. In the TOF patients, we found four copy number gains affecting three genes, of which two are important regulators of heart development (NOTCH1, ISL1) and one is located in a region associated with cardiac malformations (PRODH at 22q11). In summary, we present a novel CNV calling method based on outlier detection, which will be of particular interest for the analysis of de novo or individual CNVs in trios or cohorts up to 30 individuals, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1987323258,"Ab initio assembly of transcriptome sequencing data has been widely used to identify large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), a novel class of gene regulators involved in many biological processes. To differentiate real lincRNA transcripts from thousands of assembly artifacts, a series of filtering steps such as filters of transcript length, expression level and coding potential, need to be applied. However, an easy-to-use and publicly available bioinformatics pipeline that integrates these filters is not yet available. Hence, we implemented sebnif, an integrative bioinformatics pipeline to facilitate the discovery of bona fide novel lincRNAs that are suitable for further functional characterization. Specifically, sebnif is the only pipeline that implements an algorithm for identifying high-quality single-exonic lincRNAs that were often omitted in many studies. To demonstrate the usage of sebnif, we applied it on a real biological RNA-seq dataset from Human Skeletal Muscle Cells (HSkMC) and built a novel lincRNA catalog containing 917 highly reliable lincRNAs.

https://openalex.org/W2038416521,"Rationale Optimal management of complicated parapneumonic effusions (CPPE) remains controversial. Objectives to assess safety and efficacy of iterative therapeutic thoracentesis (ITTC), the first-line treatment of CPPE in Rennes University Hospital. Methods Patients with CPPE were identified through our computerized database. We retrospectively studied all cases of CPPE initially managed with ITTC in our institution between 2001 and 2010. ITTC failure was defined by the need for additional treatment (i.e. surgery or percutaneous drainage), or death. Results Seventy-nine consecutive patients were included. The success rate was 81% (n = 64). Only 3 patients (4%) were referred to thoracic surgery. The one-year survival rate was 88%. On multivariate analysis, microorganisms observed in pleural fluid after Gram staining and first thoracentesis volume ≥450 mL were associated with ITTC failure with adjusted odds-ratios of 7.65 [95% CI, 1.44–40.67] and 6.97 [95% CI, 1.86–26.07], respectively. The main complications of ITTC were iatrogenic pneumothorax (n = 5, 6%) and vasovagal reactions (n = 3, 4%). None of the pneumothoraces required chest tube drainage, and no hemothorax or re-expansion pulmonary edema was observed. Conclusions Although not indicated in international recommendations, ITTC is safe and effective as first-line treatment of CPPE, with limited invasiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2129530893,"Bycatch in longline fisheries threatens the viability of some seabird populations. The Hawaii longline swordfish fishery reduced seabird captures by an order of magnitude primarily through mitigating bycatch during setting. Now, 75% of captures occur during hauling. We fit observer data to a generalized additive regression model with mixed effects to determine the significance of the effect of various factors on the standardized seabird haul catch rate. Density of albatrosses attending vessels during hauling, leader length and year had largest model effects. The standardized haul catch rate significantly increased with increased albatross density during hauling. The standardized catch rate was significantly higher the longer the leader: shorter leaders place weighted swivels closer to hooks, reducing the likelihood of baited hooks becoming available to surface-scavenging albatrosses. There was a significant linear increasing temporal trend in the standardized catch rate, possibly partly due to an observed increasing temporal trend in the local abundance of albatrosses attending vessels during hauling. Swivel weight, Beaufort scale and season were also significant but smaller model effects. Most (81%) haul captures were on branchlines actively being retrieved. Future haul mitigation research should therefore focus on reducing bird access to hooks as crew coil branchlines, including methods identified here of shorter leaders and heavier swivels, and other potentially effective methods, including faster branchline coiling and shielding the area where hooks becomes accessible. The proportion of Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) captures that occurred during hauling was significantly, 1.6 times, higher than for black-footed albatrosses (P. nigripes), perhaps due to differences in the time of day of foraging and in daytime scavenging competitiveness; mitigating haul bycatch would therefore be a larger benefit to Laysans. Locally, findings identify opportunities to nearly eliminate seabird bycatch. Globally, findings fill a gap in knowledge of methods to mitigate seabird bycatch during pelagic longline hauling."
https://openalex.org/W2034057916,"Background Iron deficiency is common during pregnancy. Experimental animal studies suggest that it increases cardiovascular risk in the offspring. Objective To examine the relationship between maternal pregnancy dietary and supplement iron intake and hemoglobin, with offspring’s arterial stiffness (measured by carotid-radial pulse wave velocity), endothelial function (measured by brachial artery flow mediated dilatation), blood pressure, and adiposity (measured by body mass index), test for mediation by cord ferritin, birth weight, gestational age, and child dietary iron intake, and for effect modification by maternal vitamin C intake and offspring sex. Design Prospective data from 2958 mothers and children pairs at 10 years of age enrolled in an English birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study for Parents and Children (ALSPAC), was analysed. Results 2639 (89.2%) mothers reported dietary iron intake in pregnancy below the UK reference nutrient intake of 14.8 mg/day. 1328 (44.9%) reported taking iron supplements, and 129 (4.4%) were anemic by 18 weeks gestation. No associations were observed apart from maternal iron intake from supplements with offspring systolic blood pressure (−0.8 mmHg, 99% CI −1.7 to 0, P = 0.01 in the sample with all relevant data observed, and −0.7 mmHg, 99% CI −1.3 to 0, P = 0.008 in the sample with missing data imputed). Conclusion There was no evidence of association between maternal pregnancy dietary iron intake, or maternal hemoglobin concentration (which is less likely to be biased by subjective reporting) with offspring outcomes. There was a modest inverse association between maternal iron supplement intake during pregnancy with offspring systolic blood pressure at 10 years."
https://openalex.org/W2033447807,"The immunophilins, cyclophilins, catalyze peptidyl cis-trans prolyl-isomerization (PPIase), a rate-limiting step in protein folding and a conformational switch in protein function. Cyclophilins are also chaperones. Noncatalytic mutations affecting the only cyclophilins with known but distinct physiological substrates, the Drosophila NinaA and its mammalian homolog, cyclophilin-B, impair opsin biogenesis and cause osteogenesis imperfecta, respectively. However, the physiological roles and substrates of most cyclophilins remain unknown. It is also unclear if PPIase and chaperone activities reflect distinct cyclophilin properties. To elucidate the physiological idiosyncrasy stemming from potential cyclophilin functions, we generated mice lacking endogenous Ran-binding protein-2 (Ranbp2) and expressing bacterial artificial chromosomes of Ranbp2 with impaired C-terminal chaperone and with (Tg-Ranbp2(WT-HA)) or without PPIase activities (Tg-Ranbp2(R2944A-HA)). The transgenic lines exhibit unique effects in proteostasis. Either line presents selective deficits in M-opsin biogenesis with its accumulation and aggregation in cone photoreceptors but without proteostatic impairment of two novel Ranbp2 cyclophilin partners, the cytokine-responsive effectors, STAT3/STAT5. Stress-induced STAT3 activation is also unaffected in Tg-Ranbp2(R2944A-HA)::Ranbp2(-/-). Conversely, proteomic analyses found that the multisystem proteinopathy/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1, are down-regulated post-transcriptionally only in Tg-Ranbp2(R2944A-HA)::Ranbp2(-/-). This is accompanied by the age- and tissue-dependent reductions of diubiquitin and ubiquitylated proteins, increased deubiquitylation activity, and accumulation of the 26 S proteasome subunits S1 and S5b. These manifestations are absent in another line, Tg-Ranbp2(CLDm-HA)::Ranbp2(-/-), harboring SUMO-1 and S1-binding mutations in the Ranbp2 cyclophilin-like domain. These results unveil distinct mechanistic and biological links between PPIase and chaperone activities of Ranbp2 cyclophilin toward proteostasis of selective substrates and with novel therapeutic potential."

https://openalex.org/W2018649727,"During recent decades, over 40% of Japanese estuarine tidal flats have been lost due to coastal developments. Local populations of the saltmarsh sesarmid crab Clistocoeloma sinense, designated as an endangered species due to the limited suitable saltmarsh habitat available, have decreased accordingly, being now represented as small remnant populations. Several such populations in Tokyo Bay, have been recognised as representing distributional limits of the species. To clarify the genetic diversity and connectivity among local coastal populations of Japanese Clistocoeloma sinense, including those in Tokyo Bay, mitochondrial DNA analyses were conducted in the hope of providing fundamental information for future conservation studies and an understanding of metapopulation dynamics through larval dispersal among local populations. All of the populations sampled indicated low levels of genetic diversity, which may have resulted from recent population bottlenecks or founder events. However, the results also revealed clear genetic differentiation between two enclosed-water populations in Tokyo Bay and Ise-Mikawa Bay, suggesting the existence of a barrier to larval transport between these two water bodies. Since the maintenance of genetic connectivity is a requirement of local population stability, the preservation of extant habitats and restoration of saltmarshes along the coast of Japan may be the most effective measures for conservation of this endangered species."
https://openalex.org/W2023070757,"Malfunctions in regulatory pathways that control cell size are prominent in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we show annexin A6 (Anxa6) to be a crucial regulator of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-mediated counterhypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes. Adrenergic stimulation of H9c2 cardiomyocytes by phenylephrine (PE) increased the cell size with enhanced expression of biochemical markers of hypertrophy, concomitant with elevated expression and subcellular redistribution of Anxa6. Stable cell lines with controlled increase in Anxa6 levels were protected against PE-induced adverse changes, whereas Anxa6 knockdown augmented the hypertrophic responses. Strikingly, Anxa6 knockdown also abrogated PE-induced juxtanuclear accumulation of secretory granules (SG) containing ANP propeptides (pro-ANP), a signature of maladaptive hypertrophy having counteractive functions. Mechanistically, PE treatment prompted a dynamic association of Anxa6 with pro-ANP-SG, parallel to their participation in anterograde traffic, in an isoform-specific fashion. Moreover, Anxa6 mutants that failed to associate with pro-ANP hindered ANP-mediated protection against hypertrophy, which was rescued, at least partially, by WT Anxa6. Additionally, elevated intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) stimulated Anxa6-pro-ANP colocalization and membrane association. It also rescued pro-ANP translocation in cells expressing an Anxa6 mutant (Anxa6(ΔC)). Furthermore, stable overexpression of Anxa6(T356D), a mutant with superior flexibility, provided enhanced protection against PE, compared with WT, presumably due to enhanced membrane-binding capacity. Together, the present study delivers a cooperative mechanism where Anxa6 potentiates ANP-dependent counterhypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes by facilitating regulated traffic of pro-ANP."
https://openalex.org/W2058873673,"In this study, the role of substrate stiffness on the endocytic uptake of a cell-penetrating peptide was investigated. The cell-penetrating peptide, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase activated protein kinase II (MK2), enters a primary mesothelial cell line predominantly through caveolae. Using tissue culture polystyrene and polyacrylamide gels of varying stiffness for cell culture, and flow cytometry quantification and enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) for uptake assays, we showed that the amount of uptake of the peptide is increased on soft substrates. Further, peptide uptake per cell increased at lower cell density. The improved uptake seen on soft substrates in vitro better correlates with in vivo functional studies where 10–100 µM concentrations of the MK2 inhibitor cell penetrating peptide demonstrated functional activity in several disease models. Additional characterization showed actin polymerization did not affect uptake, while microtubule polymerization had a profound effect on uptake. This work demonstrates that cell culture substrate stiffness can play a role in endocytic uptake, and may be an important consideration to improve correlations between in vitro and in vivo drug efficacy."

Pulse-type electric fish alter their inter pulse intervals (IPIs) according to different behavioral contexts as aggression, hiding and mating. Nevertheless, only a few behavioral studies comparing the influence of different stimuli IPIs in the fish electric response have been conducted. We developed an apparatus that allows real time automatic realistic stimulation and simultaneous recording of electric pulses in freely moving Gymnotus carapo for several days. We detected and recorded pulse timestamps independently of the fish's position for days. A stimulus fish was mimicked by a dipole electrode that reproduced the voltage time series of real conspecific according to previously recorded timestamp sequences. We characterized fish behavior and the eletrocommunication in 2 conditions: stimulated by IPIs pre-recorded from other fish and random IPI ones. All stimuli pulses had the exact Gymontus carapo waveform. All fish presented a surprisingly long transient exploratory behavior (more than 8 h) when exposed to a new environment in the absence of electrical stimuli. Further, we also show that fish are able to discriminate between real and random stimuli distributions by changing several characteristics of their IPI distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2086100233,"Large-scale brain activity patterns can be visualized by optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) based on activity-dependent changes in the blood oxygenation level. Another method, flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging (AFI), exploits the mitochondrial flavoprotein autofluorescence, which is enhanced during neuronal activity. In birds, topographic mapping of visual space has been shown in the visual wulst, the avian homologue of the mammalian visual cortex by using OIS. We here applied the AFI method to visualize topographic maps in the visual wulst because with OIS, which depends on blood flow changes, blood vessel artifacts often obscure brain activity maps. We then compared both techniques quantitatively in zebra finches and in C57Bl/6J mice using the same setup and stimulation conditions. In addition to experiments with craniotomized animals, we also examined mice with intact skull (in zebra finches, intact skull imaging is not feasible probably due to the skull construction). In craniotomized animals, retinotopic maps were obtained by both methods in both species. Using AFI, artifacts caused by blood vessels were generally reduced, the magnitude of neuronal activity significantly higher and the retinotopic map quality better than that obtained by OIS in both zebra finches and mice. In contrast, our measurements in non-craniotomized mice did not reveal any quantitative differences between the two methods. Our results thus suggest that AFI is the method of choice for investigations of visual processing in zebra finches. In mice, however, if researchers decide to use the advantages of imaging through the intact skull, they will not be able to exploit the higher signals obtainable by the AFI-method."

https://openalex.org/W2037220619,"Depression and depressive symptoms predict poor adherence to medical therapy, but the association is complex, nonspecific, and difficult to interpret. Understanding this association may help to identify the mechanism explaining the results of interventions that improve both medical therapy adherence and depressive symptoms as well as determine the importance of targeting depression in adherence interventions. We previously demonstrated that Managed Problem Solving (MAPS) focused on HIV medication adherence improved adherence and viral load in patients initiating a new antiretroviral regimen. Here, we assessed whether MAPS improved depressive symptoms and in turn, whether changes in depressive symptoms mediated changes in adherence and treatment outcomes. We compared MAPS to usual care with respect to presence of depressive symptoms during the trial using logistic regression. We then assessed whether MAPS’ effect on depressive symptoms mediated the relationship between MAPS and adherence and virologic outcomes using linear and logistic regression, respectively. Mediation was defined by the disappearance of the mathematical association between MAPS and the outcomes when the proposed mediator was included in regression models. Although MAPS participants had a lower rate of depressive symptoms (OR = 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.21–0.93), there was no evidence of mediation of the effects of MAPS on adherence and virological outcome by improvements in depression. Thus, interventions for medication adherence may not need to address depressive symptoms in order to impact both adherence and depression; this remains to be confirmed, however, in other data."

Applying this approach to the proteome of the facultative intra-cellular pathogen Francisella tularensis resulted in identification of 170 novel CTL epitopes, several of which were shown to elicit highly robust T cell responses. Here we demonstrate that by DNA immunization using a short DNA fragment expressing six of the most prominent identified CTL epitopes a potent and specific CD8+ T cell responses is being induced, to all encoded epitopes, a response not observed in control mice immunized with the DNA vector alone Moreover, this CTL-specific mediated immune response prevented disease development, allowed for a rapid clearance of the bacterial infection and provided complete protection against lethal challenge (10LD50) with F. tularensis holarctica Live Vaccine Strain (LVS) (a total to 30 of 30 immunized mice survived the challenge while all control DNA vector immunized mice succumbed). Furthermore, and in accordance with these results, CD8 deficient mice could not be protected from lethal challenge after immunization with the CTL-polyepitope. Vaccination with the DNA poly-epitope construct could even protect mice (8/10) against the more demanding pulmonary lethal challenge of LVS.

https://openalex.org/W1972033590,"Background Immune protection against pathogenic organisms has been shown to incur costs. Previous studies investigating the cost of immunity have mostly focused on the metabolic requirements of immune maintenance and activation. In addition to these metabolic costs, the immune system can induce damage to the host if the immune response is mis-targeted or over-expressed. Given its non-specific nature, an over-expressed inflammatory response is often associated with substantial damage for the host. Here, we investigated the cost of an over-expressed inflammatory response in the reproductive function of male mice. Methodology/Principal Findings We experimentally blocked the receptors of an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in male mice exposed to a mild inflammatory challenge, with each treatment having an appropriate control group. The experiment was conducted on two age classes, young (3 month old) and old (15 month old) mice, to assess any age-related difference in the cost of a disrupted immune regulation. We found that the concomitant exposure to an inflammatory insult and the blockade of IL-10 induced a reduction in testis mass, compared to the three other groups. The frequency of abnormal sperm morphology was also higher in the group of mice exposed to the inflammatory challenge but did not depend on the blockade of the IL-10. Conclusions Our results provide evidence that immune regulation confers protection against the risk of inflammation-induced infertility during infection. They also suggest that disruption of the effectors involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response can have serious fitness consequences even under mild inflammatory insult and benign environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2134746578,"Extracellular matrix molecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are typical targets for some pathogenic bacteria, which allow adherence to host cells. Bacterial polysaccharide lyases depolymerize GAGs in β-elimination reactions, and the resulting unsaturated disaccharides are subsequently degraded to constituent monosaccharides by unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases (UGLs). UGL substrates are classified as 1,3- and 1,4-types based on the glycoside bonds. Unsaturated chondroitin and heparin disaccharides are typical members of 1,3- and 1,4-types, respectively. Here we show the reaction modes of bacterial UGLs with unsaturated heparin disaccharides by x-ray crystallography, docking simulation, and site-directed mutagenesis. Although streptococcal and Bacillus UGLs were active on unsaturated heparin disaccharides, those preferred 1,3- rather than 1,4-type substrates. The genome of GAG-degrading Pedobacter heparinus encodes 13 UGLs. Of these, Phep_2830 is known to be specific for unsaturated heparin disaccharides. The crystal structure of Phep_2830 was determined at 1.35-Å resolution. In comparison with structures of streptococcal and Bacillus UGLs, a pocket-like structure and lid loop at subsite +1 are characteristic of Phep_2830. Docking simulations of Phep_2830 with unsaturated heparin disaccharides demonstrated that the direction of substrate pyranose rings differs from that in unsaturated chondroitin disaccharides. Acetyl groups of unsaturated heparin disaccharides are well accommodated in the pocket at subsite +1, and aromatic residues of the lid loop are required for stacking interactions with substrates. Thus, site-directed mutations of the pocket and lid loop led to significantly reduced enzyme activity, suggesting that the pocket-like structure and lid loop are involved in the recognition of 1,4-type substrates by UGLs.

Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Enzymatic degradation of glycosaminoglycans.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Based on the sugar composition and mode of glycosidic bonds (i.e. 1,3- and 1,4-types), GAGs are categorized as hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin (Fig. 1, A and B). The polysaccharide chondroitin sulfate has repeating disaccharide units comprising β-d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc), which are linked via 1,3-glycosidic bonds. In contrast, heparin and heparan sulfate have only 1,4-type glycosidic bonds, which comprise repeating disaccharide units with uronic acid residues (α-l-iduronic acid (IdoUA) or β-GlcUA) and amino sugar residues (d-glucosamine (GlcN) or N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc)). Constituent sugar residues of chondroitin sulfate and heparin have varying numbers of sulfate groups (2.Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Order out of chaos. Assembly of ligand binding sites in heparan sulfate.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). With the exception of hyaluronan, these GAGs are present as core protein-bound proteoglycans and play multiple roles in the architecture of extracellular matrices and cell growth and differentiation (3.Gandhi N.S.

Adhesion of microbes to eukaryotic cells may be a primary mechanism for residence of normal flora and pathogenic infections. GAGs are typical microbial targets for interactions with host cells, and some specific interactions between microbes and these polysaccharides have been described (4.Sava I.G. Zhang F. Toma I.

GAGs are depolymerized by a variety of bacterial polysaccharide lyases. Based on primary structures, these enzymes are categorized into several families (PL-1–22) in the Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZy) database (6.Shim K.W. Kim D.H.

GAG-degrading enzymes include hyaluronate and chondroitin ABC lyases (family PL-8), and heparinase I (PL-13), -II (PL-21), and -III (PL-12), which have differing sequence and substrate specificities (9.Sasisekharan R.

Polysaccharide lyases depolymerize GAGs through β-elimination reactions and generally produce unsaturated disaccharides containing unsaturated uronic acid with C-C double bonds at nonreducing termini (Fig. 1B) (11.Linhardt R.J. Avci F.Y. Toida T. Kim Y.S. Cygler M. CS lyases. Structure, activity, and applications in analysis and the treatment of diseases.Adv. Pharmacol. 2006; 53: 187-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Carbon atoms C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-6 of unsaturated GlcUA (ΔGlcUA) and IdoUA (ΔIdoUA) are located in a single plane because of the formation of double bonds between C-4 and C-5 (12.Nakamichi Y. Maruyama Y. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Structural determinants in streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase for recognition of glycosaminoglycan sulfate groups.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 6262-6271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because GlcUA is a C-5 epimer of IdoUA, ΔGlcUA and ΔIdoUA are identical in structure. Hence, both ΔGlcUA and ΔIdoUA are referred to as ΔGlcUA in this paper. Unsaturated GAG disaccharides are degraded to monosaccharides by unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL), which is classified as a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 88 in the CAZy database (Fig. 1B) (7.Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy).

Purif. 2003; 29: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast to other hydrolases, UGL recognizes a double bond in ΔGlcUA and triggers the hydration of C-5 (14.Itoh T. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Crystal structure of unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase complexed with substrate.J. Biol.

Glycoside cleavage by a new mechanism in unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 19334-19337Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because ΔGlcUA is a component of all unsaturated GAG oligosaccharides, UGLs are essential for the complete degradation of GAGs. To date, all bacterial UGLs are classified as members of the GH-88 family. However, different substrate specificities accommodate structural diversities of unsaturated GAG oligosaccharides with different sugar residues, glycosidic bonds, and degrees of sulfation. For example, streptococcal UGLs and Bacillus sp. GL1 enzyme (BacillusUGL) prefer sulfated and unsulfated unsaturated disaccharides with 1,3-glycosidic bonds, respectively (16.Maruyama Y. Nakamichi Y. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.J. Biol.

Biophys. 1999; 368: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, Phep_2830, the UGL of Pedobacter heparinus (formerly known as Flavobacterium heparinum) degrades only unsaturated heparin disaccharides with 1,4-glycosidic bonds (18.Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Kiziltepe T. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R.

Recent studies have focused on the physiological functions and structures of UGLs and have revealed peculiar mechanisms of UGL catalysis using artificial substrates (15.Jongkees S.A. Withers S.G. Glycoside cleavage by a new mechanism in unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 19334-19337Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and that UGL gene disruption leads to reduced upper respiratory tract colonization by Streptococcus pneumoniae (19.Marion C. Stewart J.M. Tazi M.F. Burnaugh A.M. Linke C.M. Woodiga S.A. King S.J. Streptococcus pneumoniae can utilize multiple sources of hyaluronic acid for growth.Infect. Immun. 2012; 80: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Specific inhibitors of UGL are therefore expected to provide anti-bacterial drugs with no side effects. In addition, we demonstrated inducible mRNA expression of the streptococcal enzyme in the presence of GAG (16.Maruyama Y. Nakamichi Y. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18059-18069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and identified structural determinants of the preference of streptococcal UGL for sulfated substrates with 1,3-glycosidic bonds (12.Nakamichi Y. Maruyama Y. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Structural determinants in streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase for recognition of glycosaminoglycan sulfate groups.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 6262-6271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme recognition mechanism for 1,4-glycosidic bond-type substrates from heparin and heparan sulfate remains unknown. Degradation of heparins and heparan sulfates with 1,4-glycosidic bonds is also considered important for bacterial adherence and invasion to host cells because heparin, heparan sulfate, hyaluronan, and chondroitin sulfate are constituents of mammalian extracellular matrices (20.Esko J.D. Lindahl U. Molecular diversity of heparan sulfate.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the crystal structure of a P. heparinus UGL that has specific activity for unsaturated disaccharides with 1,4-glycosidic bonds and demonstrated the binding modes of these substrates with bacterial UGLs by x-ray crystallography, docking simulations, site-directed mutagenesis, and measurements of mutant enzyme kinetics. Unsaturated chondroitin disaccharides were purchased from Seikagaku Biobusiness (Tokyo, Japan). Unsaturated heparin disaccharides were purchased from Iduron (Manchester, UK) and Sigma. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). All other analytical grade chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. Overexpression systems for P. heparinus UGLs (Phep_2238, Phep_2649, and Phep_2830) were constructed in Escherichia coli cells as follows. Three P. heparinus UGL genes were amplified from the genome of P. heparinus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was performed using P. heparinus genomic DNA as a template, synthetic oligonucleotide primers, and KOD-FX-neo polymerase (Toyobo). Forward and reverse primers for the Phep_2238 gene were 5′-GGCATATGAAAAGAAACCTGATTTTAAAAA-3′ and 5′-CCCTCGAGTTATTTCTGTAGTTTTTTATAACGC-3′; those for the Phep_2649 gene were 5′-GGCATATGAACATTATCAAGTCAAGTCC-3′ and 5′-CCCTCGAGTCATAAACCTCTTTCTTTTA-3′, and those for the Phep_2830 gene were 5′-GGCATATGAAATCACTACTCAGTGCGTTTG-3′ and 5′-CCCTCGAGTTAAGACTGATTAATTGTTTTC-3′. Restriction sites for NdeI and XhoI are shown as underlined 5′ regions. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 30 s. PCR products were ligated with HincII-digested pUC119 (Takara, Shiga, Japan) using Ligation High version 2 (Toyobo) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol, and the resulting plasmids were digested with NdeI and XhoI to isolate UGL gene fragments. Phep_2238 and Phep_2649 DNA fragments were ligated with NdeI- and XhoI-digested pET21b vectors (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), and the Phep_2830 DNA fragment was ligated into NdeI- and XhoI-digested pCold IV vector (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) using Ligation High version 2. The resulting plasmids were designated pET21b-Phep_2238, pET21b-Phep_2649, and pCold IV-Phep_2830, respectively. To overexpress Phep_2238, Phep_2649, and Phep_2830, E. coli BL21(DE3) host cells (Novagen) were transformed with pET21b-Phep_2238 and pET21b-Phep_2649, and E. coli Rosetta-gami B host cells (Novagen) were transformed with pCold IV-Phep_2830. To express Phep_2238 or Phep_2649, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET21b-Phep_2238 or pET21b-Phep_2649 plasmid were cultured at 37 °C in Luria broth (Sigma) supplemented with sodium ampicillin (100 μg ml−1). When turbidity at 600 nm reached 0.3–0.7, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the cells were further cultured at 16 °C for 44 h. To overexpress Phep_2830, E. coli Rosetta gami B cells harboring pCold IV-Phep_2830 were cultured at 37 °C in Luria broth supplemented with sodium ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) and chloroamphenicol (33 μg ml−1).

Kinetic parameters of SagUGLs (wild-type, S365A, S365G, S368A, S368G, and K370A), BacillusUGL, Phep_2238, Phep_2649, and Phep_2830s (wild-type and F164A) with various unsaturated GAG disaccharides were determined using assays of UGL activity at 30 °C, in which decreases in substrate absorbance at 235 nm were monitored. Reaction mixtures of SagUGLs and BacillusUGL contained substrate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and enzyme. Reaction mixtures for Phep_2238, Phep_2649, and Phep_2830s contained substrate, 100 mm KPB (pH 6.0), and enzyme. Substrate concentration ranges were fixed at 0.05–1.0 mm because the absorbance at 235 nm of the substrate at over 1.0 mm exceeds measurement limitations on the spectrometer. Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) and turnover numbers (kcat) were calculated by fitting the data using the KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). To perform docking analyses of UGLs and substrates, our coordinates of SagUGL were used from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The structure of ligand-free SagUGL (PDB code 2ZZR) was selected as a receptor model. Docking analyses were performed using the AutoDock 4.2 program (23.Morris G.M. Huey R. Lindstrom W. Sanner M.F.

Chem. 2009; 30: 2785-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (13567) Google Scholar). The coordinates of CΔ6S were obtained from coordinates of SagUGL complexed with CΔ6S (PDB code 3ANK), and coordinates of unsaturated heparin disaccharides were obtained using ACD/ChemSketch Freeware, version 5.12 (Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) and the OpenBabel program (24.O'Boyle N.M. Banck M. James C.A. Morley C. Vandermeersch T. Hutchison G.R. Open Babel. An open chemical toolbox.J. Cheminform. 2011; 3: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar). Asp-175 and Lys-370 of SagUGL were treated as flexible residues because Asp-175 of SagUGL was critical for catalysis and Lys-370 showed movement during interactions with CΔ6S (12.Nakamichi Y. Maruyama Y. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Structural determinants in streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase for recognition of glycosaminoglycan sulfate groups.J. Biol.

Figures for protein structures and docking forms were prepared using the PyMOL program (25.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2004Google Scholar). Three residues (Ser-365, Ser-368, and Lys-370) of SagUGL were substituted with Ala or Gly, Ala, and Ala, and the resulting mutants were designated S365A, S365G, S368A, and K370A, respectively. Asp-182 of Phep_2238, and Arg-57, Phe-164, Asp-174, and Gly-362 of Phep_2830 were also substituted with Asn, Ala, Ala, Asn, and Tyr, and the resulting mutants were designated D182N, R57A, F164A, D174N, and G362Y, respectively. With the exception of D174N and G362Y, UGL mutants were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). D174N and G362Y were constructed using a KOD-Plus Mutagenesis Kit (Toyobo) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids pET21b-SagUGL and pCold IV-Phep_2830 were used as PCR templates for SagUGL and Phep_2830, respectively, and synthetic oligonucleotides were used as sense and antisense primers. Sense and antisense primer sequences were as follows (mutation sites are underlined): S365A, 5′-CTATTGCACGGTGTGTATGCGTGGCATTCAGGTAAAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCCTTTACCTGAATGCCACGCATACACACCGTGCAATAG-3′; S365G, 5′-CTATTGCACGGTGTGTATGGGTGGCATTCAGGTAAAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCCTTTACCTGAATGCCACCCATACACACCGTGCAATAG-3′; S368A, 5′-CACGGTGTGTATTCGTGGCATGCAGGTAAAGGAGTAGATG-3′ and 5′-CATCTACTCCTTTACCTGCATGCCACGAATACACACCGTG-3′; K370A, 5′-GTATTCGTGGCATTCAGGTGCAGGAGTAGATGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTTCATCTACTCCTGCACCTGAATGCCACGAATAC-3′; D182N, 5′-GAATTTAAGGTGATCATTAACAATATGATGAACCTGGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTCCAGGTTCATCATATTGTTAATGATCACCTTAAATTC-3′; R57A, 5′-CCAGGAATGAACCCAGCGTCTGTCAATCCGGACGGGACGG-3′ and 5′-CCGTCCCGTCCGGATTGACAGACGCTGGGTTCATTCCTGG-3′; F164A, 5′-GGCCATCCGCTCATGGGATGCCGGACACTGGCAATTTCCG-3′ and"
https://openalex.org/W2039582245,"Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a pathophysiological phenomenon, which underlies some neurological disorders, such as migraine and stroke, but its mechanisms are still not completely understood. One of the striking facts is that the spatiotemporal evolution of CSD wave is varying. Observations in experiments reveal that a CSD wave may propagate through the entire cortex, or just bypass some areas of the cortex. In this paper, we have applied a 2D reaction-diffusion equation with recovery term to study the spatiotemporal evolution of CSD. By modulating the recovery rate from CSD in the modeled cortex, CSD waves with different spatiotemporal evolutions, either bypassing some areas or propagating slowly in these areas, were present. Moreover, spiral CSD waves could also be induced in case of the transiently altered recovery rate, i.e. block release from the absolute refractory period. These results suggest that the refractory period contributes to the different propagation patterns of CSD, which may help to interpret the mechanisms of CSD propagation."
