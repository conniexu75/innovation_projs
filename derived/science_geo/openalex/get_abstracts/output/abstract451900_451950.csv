https://openalex.org/W2031680145,"Background Previous studies based on local case series estimated the annual incidence of endocarditis in the U.S. at about 4 per 100,000 population. Small-scale studies elsewhere have reported similar incidence rates. However, no nationally-representative population-based studies have verified these estimates. Methods and Findings Using the 1998–2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, which provides diagnoses from about 8 million U.S. hospitalizations annually, we examined endocarditis hospitalizations, bacteriology, co-morbidities, outcomes and costs. Hospital admissions for endocarditis rose from 25,511 in 1998 to 38, 976 in 2009 (12.7 per 100,000 population in 2009). The age-adjusted endocarditis admission rate increased 2.4% annually. The proportion of patients with intra-cardiac devices rose from 13.3% to 18.9%, while the share with drug use and/or HIV fell. Mortality remained stable at about 14.5%, as did cardiac valve replacement (9.6%). Other serious complications increased; 13.3% of patients in 2009 suffered a stroke or CNS infection, and 5.5% suffered myocardial infarction. Amongst cases with identified pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common, increasing from 37.6% in 1998 to 49.3% in 2009, 53.3% of which were MRSA. Streptococci were mentioned in 24.7% of cases, gram-negatives in 5.6% and Candida species in 1.0%. We detected no inflection in hospitalization rates after changes in prophylaxis recommendations in 2007. Mean age rose from 58.6 to 60.8 years; elderly patients suffered higher rates of myocardial infarction and death, but slightly lower rates of Staphylococcus aureus infections and neurologic complications. Our study relied on clinically diagnosed cases of endocarditis that may not meet strict criteria. Moreover, since some patients are discharged and readmitted during a single episode of endocarditis, our hospitalization figures probably slightly overstate the true incidence of this illness. Conclusions Endocarditis is more common in the U.S. than previously believed, and is steadily increasing. Preventive efforts should focus on device-associated and health-care-associated infections."
https://openalex.org/W2099445014,"Trauma and sepsis can cause acute lung injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in part by triggering neutrophil (PMN)-mediated increases in endothelial cell (EC) permeability. We had shown that mitochondrial (mt) damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) appear in the blood after injury or shock and activate human PMN. So we now hypothesized that mitochondrial DAMPs (MTD) like mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and peptides might play a role in increased EC permeability during systemic inflammation and proceeded to evaluate the underlying mechanisms. MtDNA induced changes in EC permeability occurred in two phases: a brief, PMN-independent 'spike' in permeability was followed by a prolonged PMN-dependent increase in permeability. Fragmented mitochondria (MTD) caused PMN-independent increase in EC permeability that were abolished with protease treatment. Exposure to mtDNA caused PMN-EC adherence by activating expression of adherence molecule expression in both cell types. Cellular activation was manifested as an increase in PMN calcium flux and EC MAPK phosphorylation. Permeability and PMN adherence were attenuated by endosomal TLR inhibitors. EC lacked formyl peptide receptors but were nonetheless activated by mt-proteins, showing that non-formylated mt-protein DAMPs can activate EC. Mitochondrial DAMPs can be released into the circulation by many processes that cause cell injury and lead to pathologic endothelial permeability. We show here that mitochondria contain multiple DAMP motifs that can act on EC and/or PMN via multiple pathways. This can enhance PMN adherence to EC, activate PMN-EC interactions and subsequently increase systemic endothelial permeability. Mitochondrial DAMPs may be important therapeutic targets in conditions where inflammation pathologically increases endothelial permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2044931307,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major impediment to successful cancer chemotherapy. Co-delivery of novel MDR-reversing agents and anticancer drugs to cancer cells holds great promise for cancer treatment. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) overexpression is associated with the development and progression of MDR in breast cancer, and it is emerging as a novel and promising MDR-reversing target. In this study, a multifunctional nanocomplex, composed of polyethylenimine (PEI)/poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonates) (PSS)/graphene oxide (GO) and termed PPG, was prepared using the layer-by-layer assembly method to evaluate the reversal effects of PPG as a carrier for adriamycin (ADR) along with miR-21 targeted siRNA (anti-miR-21) in cancer drug resistance. ADR was firstly loaded onto the PPG surface (PPGADR) by physical mixing and anti-miR-21 was sequentially loaded onto PPGADR through electric absorption to form (anti-miR-21)PPGADR. Cell experiments showed that PPG significantly enhanced the accumulation of ADR in MCF-7/ADR cells (an ADR resistant breast cancer cell line) and exhibited much higher cytotoxicity than free ADR, suggesting that PPG could effectively reverse ADR resistance of MCF-7/ADR. Furthermore, the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of PPG could be correlated with effective silencing of miR-21 and with increased accumulation of ADR in drug-resistant tumor cells. The endocytosis study confirmed that PPG could effectively carry drug molecules into cells via the caveolae and clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathways. These results suggest that this PPG could be a potential and efficient non-viral vector for reversing MDR, and the strategy of combining anticancer drugs with miRNA therapy to overcome MDR could be an attractive approach in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2046592570,"Subcortical structures are involved in many healthy and pathological brain processes. It is crucial for many studies to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to assess the ability to detect subcortical generators. This study aims to assess the source localization accuracy and to compare the characteristics of three inverse operators in the specific case of subcortical generators. MEG has a low sensitivity to subcortical sources mainly because of their distance from sensors and their complex cyto-architecture. However, we show that using a realistic anatomical and electrophysiological model of deep brain activity (DBA), the sources make measurable contributions to MEG sensors signals. Furthermore, we study the point-spread and cross-talk functions of the wMNE, sLORETA and dSPM inverse operators to characterize distortions in cortical and subcortical regions and to study how noise-normalization methods can improve or bias accuracy. We then run Monte Carlo simulations with neocortical and subcortical activations. In the case of single hippocampus patch activations, the results indicate that MEG can indeed localize the generators in the head and the body of the hippocampus with good accuracy. We then tackle the question of simultaneous cortical and subcortical activations. wMNE can detect hippocampal activations that are embedded in cortical activations that have less than double their amplitude, but it does not completely correct the bias to more superficial sources. dSPM and sLORETA can still detect hippocampal activity above this threshold, but such detection might include the creation of ghost deeper sources. Finally, using the DBA model, we showed that the detection of weak thalamic modulations of ongoing brain activity is possible."
https://openalex.org/W2073561387,"Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) is a cytosolic double-stranded (dsDNA) sensor essential for innate immune responses against DNA viruses and bacteria such as Francisella and Listeria. Upon dsDNA engagement, the AIM2 amino-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) is responsible for downstream signaling to the adapter protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) through homotypic PYD-PYD interactions and the assembly of an inflammasome. Toward a better understanding of the AIM2 signaling mechanism, we determined the crystal structure of the human AIM2 PYD. The structure reveals a death domain fold with a short α3 helix that is buttressed by a highly conserved lysine residue at the α2 helix, which may stabilize the α3 helix for potential interaction with partner domains. The surface of the AIM2 PYD exhibits distinct charge distribution with highly acidic α1-α2 helices and highly basic α5-α6 helices. A prominent solvent-exposed hydrophobic patch formed by residues Phe-27 and Phe-28 at the α2 helix resembles a similar surface involved in the death effector domain homotypic interactions. Docking studies suggest that the AIM2 PYD may bind the AIM2 hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear (HIN) domain or ASC PYD using overlapping surface near the α2 helix. This may ensure that AIM2 interacts with the downstream adapter ASC only upon release of the autoinhibition by the dsDNA ligand. Our work thus unveils novel structural features of the AIM2 PYD and provides insights into the potential mechanisms of the PYD-HIN and PYD-PYD interactions important for AIM2 autoinhibition and inflammasome assembly.

AIM2 was also reported to play a role in autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis through recognition of host DNA (10Dombrowski Y. Peric M. Koglin S. Kammerbauer C. Göss C. Anz D. Simanski M. Gläser R.

AIM2 contains a carboxyl-terminal HIN domain that binds dsDNA and an amino-terminal PYD that is responsible for downstream signaling to the adapter protein ASC. Previous phylogenetic analysis of the PYD sequences revealed two separate clades among the mammalian PYHIN proteins, one containing the AIM2 orthologs and the other containing all other PYHIN proteins (14Cridland J.A.

Biol. 2012; 12: 140Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In agreement with its distinct sequence, the AIM2 PYD was shown to be the only PYHIN PYD that associates with ASC to form an inflammasome (1Hornung V. Ablasser A. Charrel-Dennis M. Bauernfeind F.

Besides PYD, the death domain superfamily includes the death domain (DD), death effector domain (DED), and caspase recruitment domain (CARD). Many of them are involved in the assembly of oligomeric multiprotein signaling complexes such as the PIDDosome (DD) (20Park H.H. Logette E. Raunser S. Cuenin S. Walz T. Tschopp J. Wu H.

Despite progress in the structural characterization of the DD, DED, and CARD signaling complexes, the molecular mechanisms of PYD-mediated signaling events remain poorly understood largely because of the lack of structural information on PYD-PYD complexes. To date, the structures of eight human PYDs and two mouse PYDs have been experimentally characterized, largely through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These include the PYDs from human ASC (Protein Data Bank codes 1UCP (25Liepinsh E. Barbals R. Dahl E. Sharipo A. Staub E. Otting G.

Interestingly, all known PYD structures have a uniquely short α3 helix compared with other DD superfamily members (33Kersse K. Verspurten J. Vanden Berghe T. Vandenabeele P. The death-fold superfamily of homotypic interaction motifs.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported the crystal structure of the AIM2 HIN domain in complex with dsDNA and found that the HIN domain binds dsDNA through electrostatic attraction, and the AIM2 PYD and HIN domain interaction maintains the receptor in an autoinhibited state in the absence of dsDNA (34Jin T.

To examine the structure and function of the AIM2 PYD, we carried out crystallographic studies of the AIM2 PYD. The AIM2 PYD was crystallized as a fusion with maltose-binding protein (MBP). The structure reveals a typical death domain fold for the PYD with distinct surface charges and hydrophobic patches. We identify a highly conserved lysine residue at the α2 helix that stabilizes the short α3 helix, a common feature for all known PYD structures that has not been described previously. Our docking and binding studies suggest potential modes of the PYD-PYD and PYD-HIN associations through overlapping surface at the AIM2 PYD such that the AIM2 receptor signal transduction only occurs upon ligand engagement. The pyrin domain of human AIM2 (NCBI accession number NP_004824; residues 1–107) was cloned into a pET30a-derived vector with a non-cleavable amino-terminal MBP tag and a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag. The MBP tag harbors mutations (D82A/K83A/E172A/N173A/K239A) designed to enhance its crystallization propensity (35Ullah H. Scappini E.L. Moon A.F. Williams L.V. Armstrong D.L. Pedersen L.C.

Transformed BL21(DE3) Codon Plus RIPL cells (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) were grown at 37 °C, induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C for 4 h, harvested, and lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) plus 5 mm imidazole, DNase (Biomatik, Wilmington, DE), and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Soluble protein from the cell lysate was purified by Hisprep IMAC column (GE Healthcare) and further purified using a XK26/60 Superdex 200 size exclusion column in buffer A supplemented with 5 mm maltose (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL). The mutant AIM2 PYD constructs were produced using the Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and the expression and purification were carried essentially the same as for the wild type protein. The human ASC PYD (residues 1–91) coding sequence was cloned into a pET30a-derived vector with a tobacco etch virus protease cleavable amino-terminal GB1 tag. Expression and purification were carried out similarly to the AIM2 PYD except that the GB1 tag was removed by tobacco etch virus cleavage. Purified MBP-PYD protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml before setting up hanging drops for vapor diffusion crystallization. Multiple commercial crystallization screens were tested using the Mosquito crystallization robot (TTP Labtech, UK). Rod-shaped crystals grew at room temperature in 1 week using a well solution containing 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and 0.1 m potassium acetate at pH 4.0. 20% ethylene glycol (v/v) was added to the reservoir solution as the cryoprotectant to freeze the crystals in liquid nitrogen for x-ray diffraction data collection. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the General Medical Sciences and Cancer Institutes Collaborative Access Team (GM/CA-CAT) of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data were processed with the HKL2000 program suite (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The solvent content was 53.2% for one molecule of the fusion protein per asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with Phaser (38McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

After three washing steps using buffer B, 200 μg of AIM2 HIN protein was incubated with the beads followed by three washing steps with buffer B. The bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of buffer B plus 10 mm maltose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The GAL4-based Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid system from Clontech was used to examine the interaction between the AIM2 PYD and the ASC PYD. The PYD coding sequences were cloned into the pGBKT7 plasmid encoding DNA-binding domain and the pGADT7 plasmid encoding activation domain. Combinations of DNA-binding domain and activation domain plasmid pairs were transformed into yeast strain AH109. The cells were plated on agar plates of minimum synthetic dropout medium without leucine and tryptophan (−Leu/−Trp) to select for transformants. Single colonies were then picked and replicated onto −His/−Leu/−Trp plates. Growth of the colonies at 30 °C was recorded 72 h later. The association between the AIM2 PYD and HIN domain was measured using an ITC200 calorimeter (Microcal, Piscataway, NJ) at 288 K. All protein samples were dialyzed extensively in buffer B. The wild type or mutant MBP-AIM2 PYD at 0.3 mm was titrated into ∼200 μl of purified AIM2 HIN domain at 30 μm. The binding isotherm data were analyzed with the program Origin using a single site binding model after subtracting the buffer dilution background. A 5′,6-fluorescein-labeled 20-mer DNA oligo with a sequence of 5′-ccatcaaagagagaaagagc-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) was dissolved in buffer B and annealed with its reverse complement DNA oligo. A 4 nm concentration of the probe was mixed with 100 nm purified AIM2 HIN domain, and increasing concentrations of the wild type or mutant MBP-AIM2 PYD were added to the above DNA-HIN complex. The mixtures were then aliquoted in triplets into black 96-well plates, and the fluorescence polarization was measured with a Paradigm spectrometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

This randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CCX282-B in 436 patients with Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores were 250–450 and C-reactive protein >7.5 mg/L at study entry. In addition to stable concomitant Crohn’s medication (85% of subjects), subjects received placebo or CCX282-B (250 mg once daily, 250 mg twice daily, or 500 mg once daily) for 12 weeks. They then received 250 mg CCX282-B twice daily, open-label, through week 16. Subjects who had a clinical response (a ≥70 point drop in CDAI) at week 16 were randomly assigned to groups given placebo or CCX282-B (250 mg, twice daily) for 36 weeks. Primary endpoints were clinical response at Week 8 and sustained clinical response at Week 52. During the 12-week Induction period, the clinical response was highest in the group given 500 mg CCX282-B once daily. Response rates at week 8 were 49% in the placebo group, 52% in the group given CCX282-B 250 mg once daily (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12; p = .667 vs placebo), 48% in the group given CCX282-B 250 mg twice daily (OR = 0.95; p = .833), and 60% in the group given CCX282-B 500 mg once daily (OR = 1.53; p = .111).

https://openalex.org/W2044093336,"Clinically, circulating prolactin levels and density of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are individual risk factors for breast cancer. As tumors develop, the surrounding stroma responds with increased deposition and cross-linking of the collagen matrix (desmoplasia). In mouse models, prolactin promotes mammary carcinomas that resemble luminal breast cancers in women, and increased collagen density promotes tumor metastasis and progression. Although the contributions of the ECM to the physiologic actions of prolactin are increasingly understood, little is known about the functional relationship between the ECM and prolactin signaling in breast cancer. Here, we examined consequences of increased ECM stiffness on prolactin signals to luminal breast cancer cells in three-dimensional collagen I matrices in vitro. We showed that matrix stiffness potently regulates a switch in prolactin signals from physiologic to protumorigenic outcomes. Compliant matrices promoted physiological prolactin actions and activation of STAT5, whereas stiff matrices promoted protumorigenic outcomes, including increased matrix metalloproteinase-dependent invasion and collagen scaffold realignment. In stiff matrices, prolactin increased SRC family kinase-dependent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at tyrosine 925, FAK association with the mitogen-activated protein kinase mediator GRB2, and pERK1/2. Stiff matrices also increased co-localization of prolactin receptors and integrin-activated FAK, implicating altered spatial relationships. Together, these results demonstrate that ECM stiffness is a powerful regulator of the spectrum of prolactin signals and that stiff matrices and prolactin interact in a feed-forward loop in breast cancer progression. Our study is the first reported evidence of altered ECM-prolactin interactions in breast cancer, suggesting the potential for new therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2013825418,"Numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified multiple cortical regions that are involved in face processing in the human brain. However, few studies have characterized the face-processing network as a functioning whole. In this study, we used fMRI to identify face-selective regions in the entire brain and then explore the hierarchical structure of the face-processing network by analyzing functional connectivity among these regions. We identified twenty-five regions mainly in the occipital, temporal and frontal cortex that showed a reliable response selective to faces (versus objects) across participants and across scan sessions. Furthermore, these regions were clustered into three relatively independent sub-networks in a face-recognition task on the basis of the strength of functional connectivity among them. The functionality of the sub-networks likely corresponds to the recognition of individual identity, retrieval of semantic knowledge and representation of emotional information. Interestingly, when the task was switched to object recognition from face recognition, the functional connectivity between the inferior occipital gyrus and the rest of the face-selective regions were significantly reduced, suggesting that this region may serve as an entry node in the face-processing network. In sum, our study provides empirical evidence for cognitive and neural models of face recognition and helps elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying face recognition at the network level."
https://openalex.org/W1998715001,"Background Access to HIV diagnosis is life-saving; however the use of rapid diagnostic tests in combination is vulnerable to wrongly diagnosing HIV infection when both screening tests give a false positive result. Misclassification of HIV patients can also occur due to poor quality control, administrative errors and lack of supervision and training of staff. Médecins Sans Frontières discovered in 2004 that HIV negative individuals were enrolled in some HIV programmes. This paper describes the result of an audit of three sites to review testing practices, implement improved testing algorithms and offer re-testing to clients enrolled in the HIV clinic. Findings In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Burundi and Ethiopia patients were identified for HIV retesting. In total, 44 false-positive patients were identified in HIV programmes in DRC, two in Burundi and seven in Ethiopia. Some of those identified had been abandoned by partners or started on anti-retroviral therapy or prophylaxis. Despite potential damage to programme reputations, no impact in terms of testing uptake occurred with mean monthly testing volumes stable after introduction of re-testing. In order to prevent the problem, training, supervision and quality control of testing procedures were strengthened. A simple and feasible confirmation test was added to the test algorithm. Prevalence of false positives after introducing the changes varied from zero percent (95% CI 0%–8.2%) to 10.3 percent (95% CI: 7.2%–14.1%) in Burundi and DRC respectively. Conclusion False HIV diagnoses were found in a variety of programme settings and had devastating individual consequences. We re-tested individuals in our programmes while instituting improved testing procedures without a negative impact on test uptake. Considering the importance of correct diagnosis to the individual, as well as the resources needed to care for someone with HIV, it is critical to ensure that all patients registered in HIV programmes are accurately diagnosed."
https://openalex.org/W2105548092,"Dysfunction of β-cells is a major characteristic in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The combination of obesity and T2DM is associated with elevated plasma free fatty acids (FFAs). However, molecular mechanisms linking FFAs to β-cell dysfunction remain poorly understood. In the present study, we identified that the major endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) marker, Grp78 and ERS-induced apoptotic factor, CHOP, were time-dependently increased by exposure of β-TC3 cells to FFA. The expression of ATF6 and the phosphorylation levels of PERK and IRE1, which trigger ERS signaling, markedly increased after FFA treatments. FFA treatments increased cell apoptosis by inducing ERS in β-TC3 cells. We also found that FFA-induced ERS was mediated by the store-operated Ca(2+) entry through promoting the association of STIM1 and Orai1. Moreover, calpain-2 was required for FFA-induced expression of CHOP and activation of caspase-12 and caspase-3, thus promoting cell apoptosis in β-TC3 cells. Together, these results reveal pivotal roles for Ca(2+)/calpain-2 pathways in modulating FFA-induced β-TC3 cell ERS and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2074560701,"Iron is an essential component in many protein complexes involved in photosynthesis, but environmental iron availability is often low as oxidized forms of iron are insoluble in water. To adjust to low environmental iron levels, cyanobacteria undergo numerous changes to balance their iron budget and mitigate the physiological effects of iron depletion. We investigated changes in key protein abundances and photophysiological parameters in the model cyanobacteria Synechococcus PCC 7942 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 over a 120 hour time course of iron deprivation. The iron stress induced protein (IsiA) accumulated to high levels within 48 h of the onset of iron deprivation, reaching a molar ratio of ∼42 IsiA : Photosystem I in Synechococcus PCC 7942 and ∼12 IsiA : Photosystem I in Synechocystis PCC 6803. Concomitantly the iron-rich complexes Cytochrome b6f and Photosystem I declined in abundance, leading to a decrease in the Photosystem I : Photosystem II ratio. Chlorophyll fluorescence analyses showed a drop in electron transport per Photosystem II in Synechococcus, but not in Synechocystis after iron depletion. We found no evidence that the accumulated IsiA contributes to light capture by Photosystem II complexes."

HA binding to HARE stimulates ERK1/2 activation (Kyosseva, S. V., Harris, E. N., and Weigel, P. H. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 15047–15055). To assess a possible HA size dependence for signaling, we tested purified HA fractions of different weight-average molar mass and with narrow size distributions and Select-HATM for stimulation of HARE-mediated gene expression using an NF-κB promoter-driven luciferase reporter system. Human HARE-mediated gene expression was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner with small HA (sHA) >40 kDa and intermediate HA (iHA) <400 kDa. The hyperbolic dose response saturated at 20–50 nm with an apparent Km ∼10 nm, identical to the Kd for HA-HARE binding. Activation was not detected with oligomeric HA (oHA), sHA <40 kDa, iHA >400 kDa, or large HA (lHA). Similar responses occurred with rat HARE. Activation by sHA-iHA was blocked by excess nonsignaling sHA, iHA, or lHA, deletion of the HA-binding LINK domain, or HA-blocking antibody. Endogenous NF-κB activation also occurred in the absence of luciferase plasmids, as assessed by degradation of IκB-α. ERK1/2 activation was also HA size-dependent. The results show that HA-HARE interactions stimulate NF-κB-activated gene expression and that HARE senses a narrow size range of HA degradation products.

NF-κB is activated by many inflammatory and cell stress stimuli, including cytokines (e.g. TNF-α and IL-1β), mitogens, environmental particles, toxic metals, pathogens, and pathogen-derived products (21Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Phosphorylation meets ubiquitination: the control of NF-κB activity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). Normally, in the cytoplasm, activated NF-κB translocates to the nucleus, binds to the promoter of the targeted genes, and activates their transcription. Activation of NF-κB is a hallmark indicator in the acute phase of inflammatory response after injury or infection (22Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. NF-κB and Rel proteins: evolutionarily conserved mediators of immune responses.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar). Binding of sHA, but not lHA, to CD44 significantly increases production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (23Fujii K. Tanaka Y. Hübscher S. Saito K. Ota T. Eto S. Crosslinking of CD44 on rheumatoid synovial cells augment interleukin 6 production.Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1439-1446PubMed Google Scholar). In 3LL and embryonic fibroblasts, oHA strongly stimulates NF-κB activation by an unknown HA receptor and induces expression of metalloproteases MMP-9 and MMP-13 (24Fieber C. Baumann P. Vallon R.

Here, we used NF-κB promoter-driven Dual-Luciferase gene expression to test HA preparations of different sizes for their ability to stimulate HARE-mediated gene expression in stable HEK Flp-In 293 cell lines. HA binding to rat or human HARE stimulated NF-κB-mediated gene expression in a dose- and time-dependent way. This response was very dependent on HA size, only occurring with a narrow size range at the sHA-iHA boundary (40–400 kDa); smaller oHA or sHA and larger sHA, iHA, or lHA were inactive. The optimum signaling size was ∼140 kDa. This HARE receptor signaling system in response to HA clearance could play a role in monitoring the status of tissue biomatrix turnover throughout the body.

Preparations of sHA (with Mw = 36, 66, or 80 kDa) and iHA (with Mw = 107, 178, 436, 549, or 967 kDa) with narrow size distributions and minimal overlap were purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and characterized by SEC-multiangle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) analysis. HA to be fractionated was either variable broad size range HA (Lifecore) or MDa size HA (Genzyme) subjected to mild acid hydrolysis, under conditions that did not cleave N-acetyl groups (e.g. 0.05 n HCl at 55 °C for 1–4 h), and then neutralized. All glassware was either treated with 0.5 n NaOH or baked at 250 °C overnight. Low trace-metal ammonium acetate minimized metal ion content after lyophilization, and ethanol was included in buffers to minimize bacterial contamination. Samples were fractionated over Sephacryl HR-500 (for HA >400 kDa) or HR-400 (for HA <400 kDa) columns (3.7 × 120 cm; 1.3-liter bed volume). A Gilson PrepFC fraction collector was housed in a custom Plexiglass box to minimize dust entering the tubes. Positive pressure was maintained using an aquarium pump by air flowing through a vacu-guard filter. The elution buffer was 50 mm ammonium acetate containing 20% ethanol, and 7.5-ml fractions were collected. Portions of every third fraction were analyzed by MALLS for HA size distribution, concentration, and Mw (40Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H.

Groups of three fractions from ≥5 identical runs were pooled based on their MALLS profiles and lyophilized using Triforest Duocap flasks (ISC Bioexpress, Kaysville, UT). Pellets were dissolved in 2 ml of sterile deionized water and transferred to a 15-ml conical polypropylene tube. Sterile deionized water (4 ml) was added to the flasks, which were rocked at room temperature for 2 h to recover residual HA. The pooled 6-ml solution was filtered using a 0.2-μm polyethersulfone sterile syringe filter, lyophilized, dissolved in 2 ml of sterile deionized water, and lyophilized again. Samples taken from the pools were assessed for endotoxin using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay and analyzed by SEC-MALLS to determine final HA concentrations, Mw, and size distributions. Endotoxin levels in all purified HA samples were <1 endotoxin units/mg. HA concentrations are expressed in molar units based on weight-average mass (because this is usually provided by all vendors); values are not corrected for differences between weight-average and number-average mass. HA samples (1–3 μg/lane) were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis using 0.8–1.5% gels in TAE buffer (41Lee H.G. Cowman M.K.

Flp-In 293 cells stably expressing 190-kDa human HARE (hHARE), rat HARE (rHARE), hHARE lacking the Link domain (hHARE(ΔLink)), or empty vector (EV) were grown to confluence in Complete Medium, plated in 12-well tissue culture plates, and maintained in Complete Medium for at least 2 days prior to experiments. At 50–60% confluence, Transfection Medium was added 10 min prior to transfection. Transfection complexes were generated in serum-free medium by mixing Lipofectamine LTX and PLUS reagents with 1 μg/ml firefly luciferase (LUC) vector pGL4.32(luc2P/NF-κB-RE/Hygro) and 0.5 μg/ml pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase vector). Transiently transfected cells were grown for 18 h before use. Cells expressing 190-hHARE, 190-rHARE, and 190-hHARE mutants or EV were transiently transfected with firefly and Renilla LUC vectors as above, washed once each with sterile PBS and DMEM without serum, and then preincubated with fresh serum-free DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. To determine the time dependence for HA-HARE-mediated NF-κB activation of reporter gene expression, hHARE cells were incubated with 125 nm 80-kDa sHA for 3, 4, or 6 h (supplemental Fig. S1). Because no significant differences were seen between 3 and 6 h, we performed all experiments (to assess HA concentration and mass dependence of HARE-mediated NF-κB-activated gene expression) using a 1-h pretreatment and a 4-h treatment period (to allow ample time for gene expression and protein translation). The medium was then aspirated, and cells were processed to determine the extent of NF-κB-activated reporter gene expression (see below). After cell stimulation with HA, or TNF-α (positive control), cells were washed with sterile PBS, scraped, and harvested in serum-free medium. Cells were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min; supernatants were aspirated, and pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of serum-free medium and assayed for LUC activities using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). The amounts of firefly and Renilla LUC activities in each sample were measured and recorded as relative light units using a Glomax 20/20 luminometer (Promega). The ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla LUC activity in each condition was calculated and normalized to the value for untreated control cells (defined as 1.0). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. fold-change in firefly/Renilla LUC activity. EV or hHARE cells were grown to confluence in Complete Medium, washed with sterile PBS, and serum-starved for 1 h followed by incubation with 560- or 80-kDa HA for the indicated times.

https://openalex.org/W1985422114,"Myristate is a novel potential substrate for sphingoid base synthesis.Myocardial sphingoid base synthesis utilizes myristate; these sphingolipids are functionally non-redundant with canonical sphingoid bases.d16:0 and d16:1 sphingolipids constitute an appreciable proportion of cardiac dihydrosphingosine and dihydroceramide, with distinct biological roles.This pool of sphingolipids may play a heretofore unsuspected role in myocardial pathology or protection. The enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the formation of the sphingoid base ""backbone"" from which all sphingolipids are derived. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of SPT ameliorates pathological cardiac outcomes in models of lipid overload, but the metabolites responsible for these phenotypes remain unidentified. Recent in vitro studies have shown that incorporation of the novel subunit SPTLC3 broadens the substrate specificity of SPT, allowing utilization of myristoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) in addition to its canonical substrate palmitoyl-CoA. However, the relevance of these findings in vivo has yet to be determined. The present study sought to determine whether myristate-derived d16 sphingolipids are represented among myocardial sphingolipids and, if so, whether their function and metabolic routes were distinct from those of palmitate-derived d18 sphingolipids. Data showed that d16:0 sphingoid bases occurred in more than one-third of total dihydrosphingosine and dihydroceramides in myocardium, and a diet high in saturated fat promoted their de novo production. Intriguingly, d16-ceramides demonstrated highly limited N-acyl chain diversity, and in vitro enzyme activity assays showed that these bases were utilized preferentially to canonical bases by CerS1. Functional differences between myristate- and palmitate-derived sphingolipids were observed in that, unlike d18 sphingolipids and SPTLC2, d16 sphingolipids and SPTLC3 did not appear to contribute to myristate-induced autophagy, whereas only d16 sphingolipids promoted cell death and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in cardiomyocytes. Thus, these results reveal a previously unappreciated component of cardiac sphingolipids with functional differences from canonical sphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W2087004817,"Background The pluripotent state in embryonic stem (ES) cells is controlled by a core network of transcription factors that includes Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2. Nanog is required to reach pluripotency during somatic reprogramming and is the only core factor whose overexpression is able to oppose differentiation-promoting signals. Additionally, Nanog expression is known to fluctuate in ES cells, and different levels of Nanog seem to correlate with ES cells’ ability to respond to differentiation promoting signals. Elucidating how dynamic Nanog levels are regulated in pluripotent cells and modulate their potential is therefore critical to develop a better understanding of the pluripotent state. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe the generation and validation of a mouse ES cell line with a novel Nanog reporter (Nd, from Nanog dynamics), containing a BAC transgene where the short-lived fluorescent protein VNP is placed under Nanog regulation. We show that Nanog and VNP have similar half-lives, and that Nd cells provide an accurate and measurable read-out for the dynamic levels of Nanog. Using this reporter, we could show that ES cells with low Nanog levels indeed have higher degree of priming to differentiation, when compared with high-Nanog cells. However, low-Nanog ES cells maintain high levels of Oct4 and Sox2 and can revert to a state of high-Nanog expression, indicating that they are still within the window of pluripotency. We further show that the observed changes in Nanog levels correlate with ES cell morphology and that Nanog dynamic expression is modulated by the cellular environment. Conclusions/Significance The novel reporter ES cell line here described allows an accurate monitoring of Nanog’s dynamic expression in the pluripotent state. This reporter will thus be a valuable tool to obtain quantitative measurements of global gene expression in pluripotent ES cells in different states, allowing a detailed molecular mapping of the pluripotency landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2132915849,"The interactions of triterpenoid monodesmosidic saponins, α-hederin and δ-hederin, with lipid membranes are involved in their permeabilizing effect. Unfortunately, the interactions of these saponins with lipid membranes are largely unknown, as are the roles of cholesterol or the branched sugar moieties (two for α-hederin and one for δ-hederin) on the aglycone backbone, hederagenin. The differences in sugar moieties are responsible for differences in the molecular shape of the saponins and the effects on membrane curvature that should be the most positive for α-hederin in a transbilayer direction. In large unilamellar vesicles and monocyte cells, we showed that membrane permeabilization was dependent on the presence of membrane cholesterol and saponin sugar chains, being largest for α-hederin and smallest for hederagenin. In the presence of cholesterol, α-hederin induced the formation of nonbilayer phases with a higher rate of Brownian tumbling or lateral diffusion. A reduction of Laurdan's generalized polarization in relation to change in order of the polar heads of phospholipids was observed. Using giant unilamellar vesicles, we visualized the formation of wrinkled borders, the decrease in liposome size, budding, and the formation of macroscopic pores. All these processes are highly dependent on the sugars linked to the aglycone, with α-hederin showing a greater ability to induce pore formation and δ-hederin being more efficient in inducing budding. Hederagenin induced intravesicular budding but no pore formation. Based on these results, a curvature-driven permeabilization mechanism dependent on the interaction between saponin and sterols and on the molecular shape of the saponin and its ability to induce local spontaneous curvature is proposed."

Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes muscle paralysis and extensive sublesional bone loss and disrupts neural connections between the central nervous system (CNS) and bone. Muscle contraction elicited by electrical stimulation (ES) of nerves partially protects against SCI-related bone loss. Thus, application of ES after SCI provides an opportunity to study the effects of muscle activity on bone and roles of the CNS in this interaction, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Using a rat model of SCI, the effects on bone of ES-induced muscle contraction were characterized. The SCI-mediated increase in serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) was completely reversed by ES. In ex vivo bone marrow cell cultures, SCI increased the number of osteoclasts and their expression of mRNA for several osteoclast differentiation markers, whereas ES significantly reduced these changes; SCI decreased osteoblast numbers, but increased expression in these cells of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) mRNA, whereas ES increased expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and the OPG/RANKL ratio. A microarray analysis revealed that ES partially reversed SCI-induced alterations in expression of genes involved in signaling through Wnt, FSH, parathyroid hormone (PTH), oxytocin, and calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) pathways. ES mitigated SCI-mediated increases in mRNA levels for the Wnt inhibitors DKK1, sFRP2, and sclerostin in ex vivo cultured osteoblasts. Our results demonstrate an anti-bone-resorptive activity of muscle contraction by ES that develops rapidly and is independent of the CNS.

https://openalex.org/W2434469058,"Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. The molecular signaling involved in the pathogenesis of POAG remains unknown. Here, we report that mice lacking the α1 subunit of the nitric oxide receptor soluble guanylate cyclase represent a novel and translatable animal model of POAG, characterized by thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer and loss of optic nerve axons in the context of an open iridocorneal angle. The optic neuropathy associated with soluble guanylate cyclase α1-deficiency was accompanied by modestly increased intraocular pressure and retinal vascular dysfunction. Moreover, data from a candidate gene association study suggests that a variant in the locus containing the genes encoding for the α1 and β1 subunits of soluble guanylate cyclase is associated with POAG in patients presenting with initial paracentral vision loss, a disease subtype thought to be associated with vascular dysregulation. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis and genetics of POAG and suggest new therapeutic strategies for POAG."
https://openalex.org/W2049657896,"The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii actively modulates cytokine-induced JAK/STAT signaling pathways to facilitate survival within the host, including blocking IFNγ-mediated STAT1-dependent proinflammatory gene expression. We sought to further characterize inhibition of STAT1 signaling in infected murine dendritic cells (DC) because this cell type has not previously been examined, yet is known to serve as an early target of in vivo infection. Unexpectedly, we discovered that T. gondii infection alone induced sustained STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in DC in a parasite strain-independent manner. Maintenance of STAT1 phosphorylation required active invasion but intracellular parasite replication was dispensable. The parasite rhoptry protein ROP16, recently shown to mediate STAT3 and STAT6 phosphorylation, was not required for STAT1 phosphorylation. In combination with IFNγ, T. gondii induced synergistic STAT1 phosphorylation and binding of aberrant STAT1-containing complexes to IFNγ consensus sequence oligonucleotides. Despite these findings, parasite infection blocked STAT1 binding to the native promoters of the IFNγ-inducible genes Irf-1 and Lrg47, along with subsequent gene expression. These results reinforce the importance of parasite-mediated blockade of IFNγ responses in dendritic cells, while simultaneously showing that T. gondii alone induces STAT1 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1963498581,"Multisensory neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) show long-lasting enhancement or suppression of sound-evoked responses when stimulated with combined somatosensory-auditory stimulation. By varying the intervals between sound and somatosensory stimuli we show for the first time in vivo that DCN bimodal responses are influenced by stimulus-timing dependent plasticity. The timing rules and time courses of the observed stimulus-timing dependent plasticity closely mimic those of spike-timing dependent plasticity that have been demonstrated in vitro at parallel-fiber synapses onto DCN principal cells. Furthermore, the degree of inhibition in a neuron influences whether that neuron has Hebbian or anti-Hebbian timing rules. As demonstrated in other cerebellar-like circuits, anti-Hebbian timing rules reflect adaptive filtering, which in the DCN would result in suppression of sound-evoked responses that are predicted by activation of somatosensory inputs, leading to the suppression of body-generated signals such as self-vocalization."
https://openalex.org/W1981882177,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to be indispensable for liver regeneration because it serves as a main mitogenic stimulus driving hepatocytes toward proliferation. We hypothesized that ablating HGF in adult mice would have a negative effect on the ability of hepatocytes to regenerate. Deletion of the HGF gene was achieved by inducing systemic recombination in mice lacking exon 5 of HGF and carrying the Mx1-cre or Cre-ER(T) transgene. Analysis of liver genomic DNA from animals 10 days after treatment showed that a majority (70-80%) of alleles underwent cre-induced genetic recombination. Intriguingly, however, analysis by RT-PCR showed the continued presence of both unrecombined and recombined forms of HGF mRNA after treatment. Separation of liver cell populations into hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells showed equal recombination of genomic HGF in both cell types. The presence of the unrecombined form of HGF mRNA persisted in the liver in significant amounts even after partial hepatectomy (PH), which correlated with insignificant changes in HGF protein and hepatocyte proliferation. The amount of HGF produced by stellate cells in culture was indirectly proportional to the concentration of HGF, suggesting that a decrease in HGF may induce de novo synthesis of HGF from cells with residual unrecombined alleles. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced regeneration resulted in a substantial decrease in preexisting HGF mRNA and protein, and subsequent PH led to a delayed regenerative response. Thus, HGF mRNA persists in the liver even after genetic recombination affecting most cells; however, PH subsequent to CCl4 treatment is associated with a decrease in both HGF mRNA and protein and results in compromised liver regeneration, validating an important role of this mitogen in hepatic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2062473792,"Growing evidence demonstrates that extracellular matrices regulate many aspects of megakaryocyte (MK) development; however, among the different extracellular matrix receptors, integrin α2β1 and glycoprotein VI are the only collagen receptors studied in platelets and MKs. In this study, we demonstrate the expression of the novel collagen receptor discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) by human MKs at both mRNA and protein levels and provide evidence of DDR1 involvement in the regulation of MK motility on type I collagen through a mechanism based on the activity of SHP1 phosphatase and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). Specifically, we demonstrated that inhibition of DDR1 binding to type I collagen, preserving the engagement of the other collagen receptors, glycoprotein VI, α2β1, and LAIR-1, determines a decrease in MK migration due to the reduction in SHP1 phosphatase activity and consequent increase in the phosphorylation level of its main substrate Syk. Consistently, inhibition of Syk activity restored MK migration on type I collagen.

Therefore, dynamic regulation of MK motility, within the bone marrow environment, is critical for functional platelet production. A variety of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, differently located in the bone marrow niches, may be involved in regulating mature MK migration toward the vascular niche (4Nilsson S.K.

Among these, type I collagen is the most abundant ECM of the osteoblastic niche and has been reported to regulate different phases of MK development (6Chang Y. Auradé F. Larbret F. Zhang Y.

To this regard, we have recently demonstrated that the tensile strength of fibrils in type I collagen structure also represents a major determinant in the regulation of MK migration and platelet formation (7Chen Z.

Discoidin domain receptors (DDR1 and DDR2) are tyrosine-kinase collagen receptors (receptor tyrosine kinases) that are stimulated by fibrillar and basement membrane collagens and mediate cell adhesion and migration in different tissues (15Vogel W. Discoidin domain receptors: structural relations and functional implications.FASEB J. 1999; 13: S77-S82PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lu K.K. Trcka D. Bendeck M.P. Collagen stimulates discoidin domain receptor 1-mediated migration of smooth muscle cells through Src.Cardiovasc. Pathol. 2011; 20: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both DDR1 and DDR2 bind to several collagen subtypes, but the receptors require an intact triple helical domain for signaling, as denatured collagen, or gelatin, does not induce signaling through DDRs. Although receptor tyrosine kinases reach maximum activation within minutes after ligand binding, DDR1 has a particular kinetics of activation, slow and sustained, suggesting that this receptor may regulate longer term signals (17Vogel W.F. Abdulhussein R. Ford C.E. Sensing extracellular matrix: An update on discoidin domain receptor function.Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1108-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). After its activation, subsequent to the autophosphorylation, the receptor interacts in a phosphotyrosine dependent manner with a series of Src homology 2/3 (SH2/3) and protein tyrosine binding (PTB) domain-containing proteins, triggering DDR1 downstream responses (18Lemeer S. Bluwstein A. Wu Z. Leberfinger J. Müller K. Kramer K. Kuster B. Phosphotyrosine mediated protein interactions of the discoidin domain receptor 1.J. Proteomics. 2012; 75: 3465-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is a 72-KDa cytoplasmic nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, widely expressed in hemopoietic cells, characterized by a C-terminal kinase domain, an adjacent linker region, and an N-terminal tandem SH2 domain. Numerous studies demonstrated that Syk participates not only in regulating cell division and proliferation, but also cell invasiveness and metastatic capacity, in particular being down-regulated in metastatic cancer (19Coopman P.J. Do M.T. Barth M. Bowden E.T. Hayes A.J. Basyuk E. Blancato J.K. Vezza P.R. McLeskey S.W. Mangeat P.H. Mueller S.C.

Transcription repressor activity of spleen tyrosine kinase mediates breast tumor suppression.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10289-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been suggested that interaction of DDR1 and Syk may regulate epithelial cell motility (22Neuhaus B. Bühren S. Böck B. Alves F. Vogel W.F. Kiefer F. Migration inhibition of mammary epithelial cells by Syk is blocked in the presence of DDR1 receptors.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 3757-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of receptor tyrosine kinases is tightly regulated by the concerted activity of kinases and phosphatases (23Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. The 'Shp'ing news: SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases in cell signaling.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). DDR1 was reported to recruit the non-transmembrane phosphatase SHP2 to suppress integrin signaling (24Wang C.Z. Su H.W. Hsu Y.C. Shen M.R. Tang M.J. A discoidin domain receptor 1/SHP-2 signaling complex inhibits α2β1-integrin-mediated signal transducers and activators of transcription 1/3 activation and cell migration.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2839-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although SHP2 is expressed ubiquitously, the expression of SHP1, another member of the family, is restricted to the hemopoietic lineages. Further, Huang et al. (25Huang Y. Arora P. McCulloch C.A. Vogel W.F. The collagen receptor DDR1 regulates cell spreading and motility by associating with myosin IIA.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1637-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) demonstrated that DDR1 interaction with myosin IIA regulates cell spreading and migration on type I collagen in epithelial cells. Altogether, these data point out that DDR1 may represent an important new regulator of MK function. Thus, in the present study, we show, for the first time, that human MKs express DDR1 that is activated upon MK adhesion on fibrillar type I collagen. Further, we demonstrate that DDR1 regulates MK Syk-mediated migration through activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1. These experiments provide evidence that new receptors are involved in the elaborate regulation of MK function in the ECM component environment. Type I collagen was purified as described previously (26Tenni R. Sonaggere M. Viola M. Bartolini B. Tira M.E. Rossi A. Orsini E. Ruggeri A. Ottani V.

Control wells were coated with 200 μl containing 5 μg of BSA in NaCl/Pi. All analyses were done at least in triplicate. After rinsing with 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the wells were incubated with 200 μl of 1% (w/v) BSA in NaCl/Pi for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing as described above, the coated wells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 20 μg/ml DDR1-Fc blocking molecule in 200 μl of NaCl/Pi, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. For every solid phase experiment, control for dose-dependent, nonspecific binding to coated BSA wells was performed, under identical conditions. Bound DDR1-Fc were incubated for 2 h with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG1 antibodies for detection. Horseradish peroxidase was diluted 1:1000 in 2 mg/ml BSA solution followed by a rinse and by the substrate solution (0.04% o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and 0.04% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in a buffer containing 514 mm disodium hydrogen phosphate, 24.3 mm citric acid, pH 5). Color development was stopped by adding 100 μl of 3 m HCl, and the absorbance was measured at 490–655 nm using a microplate reader. Peripheral blood from healthy subjects was collected in citric acid/citrate/dextrose (ACD) as anticoagulant (blood:ACD, 6:1, v/v) in the presence of 0.2 units/ml apyrase and 1 μm PGE1. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifuging blood samples at 200 × g for 10 min. The platelet-rich plasma was then aspirated, centrifuged at 1200 × g for 10 min, and washed with PIPES buffer (20 mm PIPES and 136 mm NaCl, pH 6.5). Washed platelets were then lysed in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer (0.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol), in the presence of a 2% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), on ice for 30 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,700 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. MKs, 1 × 106 cells/condition, were seeded on 25 μg/ml type I collagen-coated 6-well plates or on plastic.

Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. For immunoprecipitation, cellular lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose. Precleared lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-DDR1 or anti-LAIR-1 or anti-SHP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h at 4 °C on a rotatory shaker followed by adding 100 μl of 50 mg/ml protein A-Sepharose and incubation overnight at 4 °C on a rotatory shaker.

A decrease in CCN2 expression and proximal promoter activity was observed in NP cells after hypoxic culture. Analysis of both human and mouse CCN2 promoters using the JASPAR core database revealed the presence of putative hypoxia response elements. Transfection experiments showed that both promoter activities and CCN2 expression decreases in hypoxia in a HIF-1α-dependent fashion. Interestingly, deletion analysis and mutation of the hypoxia responsive elements individually or in combination resulted in no change in promoter activity in response to hypoxia or in response to HIF-1α, suggesting an indirect mode of regulation. Notably, silencing of endogenous CCN2 increased HIF-1α levels and its target gene expression, suggesting a role for CCN2 in controlling basal HIF-1α levels. On the other hand, treatment of cells with rCCN2 resulted in a decrease in the ability of HIF-1α transactivating domain to recruit co-activators and diminished target gene expression. Last, knockdown of CCN2 in NP cells results in a significant decrease in GAG synthesis and expression of AGGRECAN and COLLAGEN II. Immunohistochemical staining of intervertebral discs of Ccn2 null embryos shows a decrease in aggrecan. These findings reveal a negative feedback loop between CCN2 and HIF-1α in NP cells and demonstrate a role for CCN2 in maintaining matrix homeostasis in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2142846383,"We describe a mild form of disproportionate dwarfism in Labrador Retrievers, which is not associated with any obvious health problems such as secondary arthrosis. We designate this phenotype as skeletal dysplasia 2 (SD2). It is inherited as a monogenic autosomal recessive trait with incomplete penetrance primarily in working lines of the Labrador Retriever breed. Using 23 cases and 37 controls we mapped the causative mutation by genome-wide association and homozygosity mapping to a 4.44 Mb interval on chromosome 12. We re-sequenced the genome of one affected dog at 30x coverage and detected 92 non-synonymous variants in the critical interval. Only two of these variants, located in the lymphotoxin A (LTA) and collagen alpha-2(XI) chain gene (COL11A2), respectively, were perfectly associated with the trait. Previously described COL11A2 variants in humans or mice lead to skeletal dysplasias and/or deafness. The dog variant associated with disproportionate dwarfism, COL11A2:c.143G>C or p.R48P, probably has only a minor effect on collagen XI function, which might explain the comparatively mild phenotype seen in our study. The identification of this candidate causative mutation thus widens the known phenotypic spectrum of COL11A2 mutations. We speculate that non-pathogenic COL11A2 variants might even contribute to the heritable variation in height."

Occasionally H5N1 viruses cross the species barrier and infect humans, sometimes with a severe clinical outcome. When this happens, there is a chance of reassortment between H5N1 and human influenza viruses. To assess the potential of H5N1 viruses to reassort with contemporary human influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and pandemic H1N1), we used an in vitro selection method to generate reassortant viruses, that contained the H5 hemagglutinin gene, and that have a replication advantage in vitro. We found that the neuraminidase and matrix gene segments of human influenza viruses were preferentially selected by H5 viruses. However, these H5 reassortant viruses did not show a marked increase in replication in MDCK cells and human bronchial epithelial cells. In ferrets, inoculation with a mixture of H5N1-pandemic H1N1 reassortant viruses resulted in outgrowth of reassortant H5 viruses that had incorporated the neuraminidase and matrix gene segment of pandemic 2009 H1N1. This virus was not transmitted via aerosols or respiratory droplets to naïve recipient ferrets. Altogether, these data emphasize the potential of avian H5N1 viruses to reassort with contemporary human influenza viruses. The neuraminidase and matrix gene segments of human influenza viruses showed the highest genetic compatibility with HPAI H5N1 virus."

These recent insights generated a new interest in the factors creating variation in the strength of social relationships. Whether and how animals discriminate paternal kin from non-kin and bias their social behavior accordingly is being debated. This study explores the relative importance of dominance rank, age, maternal and paternal relatedness in shaping dyadic affiliative relationships in a group of 30 captive rhesus macaque females. The strength of social relationships, measured by the composite sociality index from observational data, was independently predicted in GLMMs by both maternal and paternal relatedness as well as rank similarity. In addition, social bonds between paternal half-sisters were stronger than between distantly related kin suggesting that females biased their affiliative effort towards paternal relatives. Despite identical relatedness coefficients bonds between mothers and their daughters were three times as strong as those between full sisters. Together these results add to the growing body of evidence for paternal kin biases in affiliative behavior and highlight that females prefer descendent over lateral kin."
https://openalex.org/W2003084689,"Mucociliary airway clearance is an innate defense mechanism that protects the lung from harmful effects of inhaled pathogens. In order to escape mechanical clearance, airway pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) are thought to inactivate mucociliary clearance by mechanisms such as slowing of ciliary beating and lytic damage of epithelial cells. Pore-forming toxins like pneumolysin, may be instrumental in these processes. In a murine in vitro airway infection model using tracheal epithelial cells grown in air-liquid interface cultures, we investigated the functional consequences on the ciliated respiratory epithelium when the first contact with pneumococci is established. High-speed video microscopy and live-cell imaging showed that the apical infection with both wildtype and pneumolysin-deficient pneumococci caused insufficient fluid flow along the epithelial surface and loss of efficient clearance, whereas ciliary beat frequency remained within the normal range. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy demonstrated that pneumococci caused specific morphologic aberrations of two key elements in the F-actin cytoskeleton: the junctional F-actin at the apical cortex of the lateral cell borders and the apical F-actin, localized within the planes of the apical cell sides at the ciliary bases. The lesions affected the columnar shape of the polarized respiratory epithelial cells. In addition, the planar architecture of the entire ciliated respiratory epithelium was irregularly distorted. Our observations indicate that the mechanical supports essential for both effective cilia strokes and stability of the epithelial barrier were weakened. We provide a new model, where - in pneumococcal infection - persistent ciliary beating generates turbulent fluid flow at non-planar distorted epithelial surface areas, which enables pneumococci to resist mechanical cilia-mediated clearance."

Ca2+/CaM mediates a negative feedback regulation of Cav1.2 by incoming Ca2+ ions (Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI)). CaBP1 eliminates this action of CaM through a poorly understood mechanism. We examined the hypothesis that CaBP1 acts by competing with CaM for common interaction sites in the α1C- subunit using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and recording of Cav1.2 currents in Xenopus oocytes. FRET detected interactions between fluorescently labeled CaM or CaBP1 with the membrane-attached proximal C terminus (pCT) and the N terminus (NT) of α1C. However, mutual overexpression of CaM and CaBP1 proved inadequate to quantitatively assess competition between these proteins for α1C. Therefore, we utilized titrated injection of purified CaM and CaBP1 to analyze their mutual effects. CaM reduced FRET between CaBP1 and pCT, but not NT, suggesting competition between CaBP1 and CaM for pCT only. Titrated injection of CaBP1 and CaM altered the kinetics of CDI, allowing analysis of their opposite regulation of CaV1.2. The CaBP1-induced slowing of CDI was largely eliminated by CaM, corroborating a competition mechanism, but 15–20% of the effect of CaBP1 was CaM-resistant. Both components of CaBP1 action were present in a truncated α1C where N-terminal CaM- and CaBP1-binding sites have been deleted, suggesting that the NT is not essential for the functional effects of CaBP1.

https://openalex.org/W2125919282,"It is currently unknown how mucosal adjuvants cause induction of secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), and how T cell-dependent (TD) or -independent (TI) pathways might be involved. Mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) are the primary antigen presenting cells driving TI IgA synthesis, by producing a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), B cell activating factor (BAFF), Retinoic Acid (RA), TGF-β or nitric oxide (NO). We hypothesized that the mucosal adjuvant Cholera Toxin subunit B (CTB) could imprint non-mucosal DCs to induce IgA synthesis, and studied the mechanism of its induction. In vitro, CTB-treated bone marrow derived DCs primed for IgA production by B cells without the help of T cells, yet required co-signaling by different Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands acting via the MyD88 pathway. CTB-DC induced IgA production was blocked in vitro or in vivo when RA receptor antagonist, TGF-β signaling inhibitor or neutralizing anti-TGF-β was added, demonstrating the involvement of RA and TGF-β in promoting IgA responses. There was no major involvement for BAFF, APRIL or NO. This study highlights that synergism between CTB and MyD88-dependent TLR signals selectively imprints a TI IgA-inducing capacity in non-mucosal DCs, explaining how CTB acts as an IgA promoting adjuvant."

Our objectives were to determine whether FRS was associated with cardiovascular events, and to evaluate the role of new risk markers and echocardiographic parameters when they were added to a FRS model. This study enrolled 439 CKD patients. The FRS is used to identify individuals categorically as “low” (<10% of 10-year risk), “intermediate” (10–20% risk) or “high” risk (≧ 20% risk). A significant improvement in model prediction was based on the −2 log likelihood ratio statistic and c-statistic. “High” risk (v.s. “low” risk) predicts cardiovascular events either without (hazard ratios [HR] 2.090, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.144 to 3.818) or with adjustment for clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic parameters (HR 1.924, 95% CI 1.008 to 3.673). Besides, the addition of albumin, hemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, left atrial diameter >4.7 cm, left ventricular hypertrophy or left ventricular ejection fraction<50% to the FRS model significantly improves the predictive values for cardiovascular events. In CKD patients, “high” risk categorized by FRS predicts cardiovascular events. Novel biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters provide additional predictive values for cardiovascular events. Future study is needed to assess whether risk assessment enhanced by using these biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters might contribute to more effective prediction and better care for patients."

An understanding of koala chlamydial disease pathogenesis and the development of effective strategies to control infections continue to be hindered by an almost complete lack of species-specific immunological reagents. The cell-mediated immune response has been shown to play an influential role in the response to chlamydial infection in other hosts. The objective of this study, hence, was to provide preliminary data on the role of two key cytokines, pro-inflammatory tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 (IL10), in the koala Chlamydia pecorum response. Utilising sequence homology between the cytokine sequences obtained from several recently sequenced marsupial genomes, this report describes the first mRNA sequences of any koala cytokine and the development of koala specific TNFα and IL10 real-time PCR assays to measure the expression of these genes from koala samples. In preliminary studies comparing wild koalas with overt chlamydial disease, previous evidence of C. pecorum infection or no signs of C. pecorum infection, we revealed strong but variable expression of TNFα and IL10 in wild koalas with current signs of chlamydiosis. The description of these assays and the preliminary data on the cell-mediated immune response of koalas to chlamydial infection paves the way for future studies characterising the koala immune response to a range of its pathogens while providing reagents to assist with measuring the efficacy of ongoing attempts to develop a koala chlamydial vaccine."

In our study, we sequenced the most important coding regions of FGFR2 in somatic tumor tissue of 140 sporadic breast cancer patients and performed MLPA analysis to detect copy number variations in FGFR2 and FGF10. We identified one somatic heterozygous missense mutation, p.K660N (c.1980G>C), within the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR2 in tumor tissue of a sporadic breast cancer patient, which is likely mediated by the FGFR2-IIIb isoform. The presence of wild type and mutated alleles in equal quantities suggests that the mutation has driven clonal amplification of mutant cells. We have analyzed the tyrosine kinase activity of p.K660N and another recently described somatic breast cancer mutation in FGFR2, p.R203C, after expression in HEK293 cells and demonstrated that the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of both mutant proteins is strongly increased resulting in elevated phosphorylation and activity of downstream effectors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of functional analysis of somatic breast cancer mutations in FGFR2 providing evidence for the activating nature of FGFR2-mediated signalling in the pathogenesis of breast cancer."

The interactions of tamoxifen and its metabolites with chitosan 15, 100 and 200 KD were investigated in aqueous solution, using FTIR, fluorescence spectroscopic methods and molecular modeling. The structural analysis showed that tamoxifen and its metabolites bind chitosan via both hydrophilic and hydrophobic contacts with overall binding constants of K(tam-ch-15) = 8.7 ( ± 0.5) × 10(3) M(-1), K(tam-ch-100) = 5.9 (± 0.4) × 10(5) M(-1), K(tam-ch-200) = 2.4 (± 0.4) × 10(5) M(-1) and K(hydroxytam-ch-15) = 2.6(± 0.3) × 10(4) M(-1), K(hydroxytam - ch-100) = 5.2 ( ± 0.7) × 10(6) M(-1) and K(hydroxytam-ch-200) = 5.1 (± 0.5) × 10(5) M(-1), K(endox-ch-15) = 4.1 (± 0.4) × 10(3) M(-1), K(endox-ch-100) = 1.2 (± 0.3) × 10(6) M(-1) and K(endox-ch-200) = 4.7 (± 0.5) × 10(5) M(-1) with the number of drug molecules bound per chitosan (n) 2.8 to 0.5.

Although previous studies have reported cytokeratin 14+/p63+ keratinocyte generation from hPSCs, the multipotent progenitors of epithelial lineages have not been described and the developmental pathways regulating epithelial commitment remain largely unknown. Here we report membrane localization of β-catenin during retinoic acid (RA) – induced epithelial differentiation. In addition hPSC treatment with the Src family kinase inhibitor SU6656 modulated β-catenin localization and produced an enriched population of simple epithelial cells under defined culture conditions. SU6656 strongly upregulated expression of cytokeratins 18 and 8 (K18/K8), which are expressed in simple epithelial cells, while repressing expression of the pluripotency gene Oct4. This homogeneous population of K18+K8+Oct4− simple epithelial precursor cells can further differentiate into cells expressing keratinocyte or corneal-specific markers. These enriched hPSC-derived simple epithelial cells may provide a ready source for development and toxicology cell models and may serve as a progenitor for epithelial cell transplantation applications."
https://openalex.org/W2066900292,"BRIL is a bone-specific membrane protein that is involved in osteogenesis imperfecta type V.Bril transcription is activated by Sp1, Sp3, OSX, and GLI2 and by CpG demethylation.Regulation of Bril involves trans-acting factors integrating at conserved promoter elements and epigenetic modifications.Identification of the mechanisms governing Bril transcription is important to understand its role in skeletal biology. Bril encodes a small membrane protein present in osteoblasts. In humans, a single recurrent mutation in the 5'-UTR of BRIL causes osteogenesis imperfecta type V. The exact function of BRIL and the mechanism by which it contributes to disease are still unknown. The goal of the current study was to characterize the mechanisms governing Bril transcription in humans, rats, and mice. In the three species, as detected by luciferase reporter assays in UMR106 cells, we found that most of the base-line regulatory activity was localized within ∼250 bp upstream of the coding ATG. Co-transfection experiments indicated that Sp1 and Sp3 were potent inducers of the promoter activity, through the binding of several GC-rich boxes. Osterix was a weak activator but acted cooperatively with Sp1 and GLI2 to synergistically induce the BRIL promoter. GLI2, a mediator of hedgehog signaling pathway, was also a potent activator of BRIL through a single GLI binding site. Correspondingly, agonists of the hedgehog pathway (purmorphamine and Indian hedgehog) in MC3T3 osteoblasts led to increased BRIL levels. The BRIL promoter activity was also found to be negatively modulated through two different mechanisms. First, the ZFP354C zinc finger protein repressed basal and Sp1-induced activity. Second, CpG methylation of the promoter region correlated with an inactive state and prevented Sp1 activation. The data provide the very first analyses of the cis- and trans-acting factors regulating Bril transcription. They revealed key roles for the Sp members and GLI2 that possibly cooperate to activate Bril when the promoter becomes demethylated."

One of its main advantages compared with other diatom model systems is that sexual crosses can be made routinely, offering unprecedented possibilities for forward genetics. To date, nothing is known about the genetic basis of sex determination in diatoms. Here, we report on the construction of mating type-specific linkage maps for S. robusta, and use them to identify a single locus sex determination system in this diatom. We identified 13 mating type plus and 15 mating type minus linkage groups obtained from the analysis of 463 AFLP markers segregating in a full-sib family, covering 963.7 and 972.2 cM, respectively. Five linkage group pairs could be identified as putative homologues. The mating type phenotype mapped as a monogenic trait, disclosing the mating type plus as the heterogametic sex. This study provides the first evidence for a genetic sex determining mechanism in a diatom."

In this report, we used this non-human primate as a model of cerebral thrombosis and observed the recovery process.Five common marmosets were used. Cerebral ischemia was produced via intravascular thrombosis induced by an intravenous injection of Rose Bengal and irradiation with green light. After inducing cerebral infarction, we observed the behavior of marmosets via a continuous video recording. We evaluated maximum speed, mean speed, and distance traveled in 1 min. In addition, we evaluated scores for feeding behavior, upper limb grip, and lower limb grip. We confirmed the infarct area after cerebral infarction using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining in a separate marmoset.We found functional decreases 2 days after creating the cerebral infarction in all measurements. Total distance traveled, average speed, upper limb score, and feeding behavior score did not recover to pre-infarction levels within 28 days. Maximum speed in 1 min and lower limb score recovered 28 days after infarction as compared to pre-infarction levels. We confirmed the infarct area of 11.4 mm × 6.8 mm as stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride.We were able to create a primate photothrombosis-induced cerebral infarction model using marmosets and observe functional recovery.

ATP-dependent proteases engage, translocate, and unfold substrate proteins. A sequence with only Gly and Ala residues (glycine-alanine repeat; GAr) encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus of humans inhibits eukaryotic proteasome activity. It causes the ATPase translocase to slip on its protein track, stalling unfolding and interrupting degradation. The bacterial protease ClpXP is structurally simpler than the proteasome but has related elements: a regulatory ATPase complex (ClpX) and associated proteolytic chamber (ClpP). In this study, GAr sequences were found to impair ClpXP function much as in proteasomes. Stalling depended on interaction between a GAr and a suitably spaced and positioned folded domain resistant to mechanical unfolding. Persistent unfolding failure results in the interruption of degradation and the production of partial degradation products that include the resistant domain. The capacity of various sequences to cause unfolding failure was investigated. Among those tested, a GAr was most effective, implying that viral selection had optimized processivity failure. More generally, amino acids of simple shape and small size promoted unfolding failure. The ClpX ATPase is a homohexamer. Partial degradation products could exit the complex through transient gaps between the ClpX monomers or, alternatively, by backing out. Production of intermediates by diverse topological forms of the hexamer was shown to be similar, excluding lateral escape. In principle, a GAr could interrupt degradation because 1) the translocase thrusts forward less effectively or because 2) the translocase retains substrate less well when resetting between forward strokes. Kinetic analysis showed that the predominant effect was through the second of these mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2093981892,"The fibrinolytic activity of plasmin plays a fundamental role in resolution of blood clots and clearance of extravascular deposited fibrin in damaged tissues. These vital functions of plasmin are exploited by malignant cells to accelerate tumor growth and facilitate metastases. Mice lacking functional plasmin thus display decreased tumor growth in a variety of cancer models. Interestingly, this role of plasmin has, in regard to skin cancer, been shown to be restricted to male mice. It remains to be clarified whether gender also affects other phenotypic characteristics of plasmin deficiency or if this gender effect is restricted to skin cancer. To investigate this, we tested the effect of gender on plasmin dependent immune cell migration, accumulation of hepatic fibrin depositions, skin composition, and skin wound healing. Gender did not affect immune cell migration or hepatic fibrin accumulation in neither wildtype nor plasmin deficient mice, and the existing differences in skin composition between males and females were unaffected by plasmin deficiency. In contrast, gender had a marked effect on the ability of plasmin deficient mice to heal skin wounds, which was seen as an accelerated wound closure in female versus male plasmin deficient mice. Further studies showed that this gender effect could not be reversed by ovariectomy, suggesting that female sex-hormones did not mediate the accelerated skin wound healing in plasmin deficient female mice. Histological examination of healed wounds revealed larger amounts of fibrotic scars in the provisional matrix of plasmin deficient male mice compared to female mice. These fibrotic scars correlated to an obstruction of cell infiltration of the granulation tissue, which is a prerequisite for wound healing. In conclusion, the presented data show that the gender dependent effect of plasmin deficiency is tissue specific and may be secondary to already established differences between genders, such as skin thickness and composition."
https://openalex.org/W2047475117,"The Histidine Triad Proteins (HTPs), also known as Pht proteins in Streptococcus pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. Although many studies have revealed the importance of HTPs in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. In this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. By further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. First, htp genes originated earlier than the Streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups. Second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of Streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. Third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp I and htp II. Although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in Streptococcus suis, htp II members are distinct from htp I due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the C-terminus. Finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. Specifically, the regions outside the HTP domains are under strong positive selection. This distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped Streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2163797186,"Transcription factor (TF) binding at specific DNA sequences is the fundamental step in transcriptional regulation and is highly dependent on the chromatin structure context, which may be affected by specific histone modifications and variants, known as histone marks. The lack of a global binding map for hundreds of TFs means that previous studies have focused mainly on histone marks at binding sites for several specific TFs. We therefore studied 11 histone marks around computationally-inferred and experimentally-determined TF binding sites (TFBSs), based on 164 and 34 TFs, respectively, in human lymphoblastoid cell lines. For H2A.Z, methylation of H3K4, and acetylation of H3K27 and H3K9, the mark patterns exhibited bimodal distributions and strong pairwise correlations in the 600-bp region around enriched TFBSs, suggesting that these marks mainly coexist within the two nucleosomes proximal to the TF sites. TFs competing with nucleosomes to access DNA at most binding sites, contributes to the bimodal distribution, which is a common feature of histone marks for TF binding. Mark H3K79me2 showed a unimodal distribution on one side of TFBSs and the signals extended up to 4000 bp, indicating a longer-distance pattern. Interestingly, H4K20me1, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H3K9me3, which were more diffuse and less enriched surrounding TFBSs, showed unimodal distributions around the enriched TFBSs, suggesting that some TFs may bind to nucleosomal DNA. Besides, asymmetrical distributions of H3K36me3 and H3K9me3 indicated that repressors might establish a repressive chromatin structure in one direction to repress gene expression. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the ranges of histone marks associated with TF binding, and the common features of these marks around the binding sites. These findings have epigenetic implications for future analysis of regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W2061186592,"The airway epithelium serves multiple roles in the defense of the lung. Not only does it act as a physical barrier, it acts as a distal extension of the innate immune system. We investigated the role of the airway epithelium in the interaction with flagella, an important virulence factor of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a cause of ventilator associated pneumonia and significant morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. Flagella were required for transmigration across polarized airway epithelial cells and this was a direct consequence of motility, and not a signaling effect. Purified flagella did not alter the barrier properties of the epithelium but were observed to be rapidly endocytosed inside epithelial cells. Neither flagella nor intact P. aeruginosa stimulated epithelial inflammasome signaling. Flagella-dependent signaling required dynamin-based uptake as well as TLR5 and primarily led to the induction of proinflammatory (Tnf, Il6) as well as neutrophil (Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Ccl3) and macrophage (Ccl20) chemokines. Although flagella are important in invasion across the epithelial barrier their shedding in the airway lumen results in epithelial uptake and signaling that has a major role in the initial recruitment of immune cells in the lung."
https://openalex.org/W2046569666,"Stalk-eyed flies (family Diopsidae) are a model system for studying sexual selection due to the elongated and sexually dimorphic eye-stalks found in many species. These flies are of additional interest because their X chromosome is derived largely from an autosomal arm in other flies. To identify candidate genes required for development of dimorphic eyestalks and investigate how sex-biased expression arose on the novel X, we compared gene expression between males and females using oligonucleotide microarrays and RNA from developing eyestalk tissue or adult heads in the dimorphic diopsid, Teleopsis dalmanni. Microarray analysis revealed sex-biased expression for 26% of 3,748 genes expressed in eye-antennal imaginal discs and concordant sex-biased expression for 86 genes in adult heads. Overall, 415 female-biased and 482 male-biased genes were associated with dimorphic eyestalk development but not differential expression in the adult head. Functional analysis revealed that male-biased genes are disproportionately associated with growth and mitochondrial function while female-biased genes are associated with cell differentiation and patterning or are novel transcripts. With regard to chromosomal effects, dosage compensation occurs by elevated expression of X-linked genes in males. Genes with female-biased expression were more common on the X and less common on autosomes than expected, while male-biased genes exhibited no chromosomal pattern. Rates of protein evolution were lower for female-biased genes but higher for genes that moved on or off the novel X chromosome. These findings cannot be due to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation or by constraints associated with dosage compensation. Instead, they could be consistent with sexual conflict in which female-biased genes on the novel X act primarily to reduce eyespan in females while other genes increase eyespan in both sexes. Additional information on sex-biased gene expression in other tissues and related sexually monomorphic species could confirm this interpretation."

https://openalex.org/W2030304075,"The auditory system creates a neuronal representation of the acoustic world based on spectral and temporal cues present at the listener's ears, including cues that potentially signal the locations of sounds. Discrimination of concurrent sounds from multiple sources is especially challenging. The current study is part of an effort to better understand the neuronal mechanisms governing this process, which has been termed “auditory scene analysis”. In particular, we are interested in spatial release from masking by which spatial cues can segregate signals from other competing sounds, thereby overcoming the tendency of overlapping spectra and/or common temporal envelopes to fuse signals with maskers. We studied detection of pulsed tones in free-field conditions in the presence of concurrent multi-tone non-speech maskers. In “energetic” masking conditions, in which the frequencies of maskers fell within the ±1/3-octave band containing the signal, spatial release from masking at low frequencies (∼600 Hz) was found to be about 10 dB. In contrast, negligible spatial release from energetic masking was seen at high frequencies (∼4000 Hz). We observed robust spatial release from masking in broadband “informational” masking conditions, in which listeners could confuse signal with masker even though there was no spectral overlap. Substantial spatial release was observed in conditions in which the onsets of the signal and all masker components were synchronized, and spatial release was even greater under asynchronous conditions. Spatial cues limited to high frequencies (>1500 Hz), which could have included interaural level differences and the better-ear effect, produced only limited improvement in signal detection. Substantially greater improvement was seen for low-frequency sounds, for which interaural time differences are the dominant spatial cue."
https://openalex.org/W1965381508,"Many aspects of the immune system, including circulating cytokine levels as well as counts and function of various immune cell types, present circadian rhythms. Notably, the mortality rate of animals subjected to high doses of lipopolysaccharide is dependent on the time of treatment. In addition, the severity of symptoms of various inflammatory conditions follows a daily rhythmic pattern. The mechanisms behind the crosstalk between the circadian and immune systems remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that localized inflammation induced by turpentine oil (TURP) causes a time-dependent induction of interleukin (IL)-6 and has time-, gene- and tissue-specific effects on clock gene expression. More precisely, TURP blunts the peak of Per1 and Per2 expression in the liver while in other tissues, the expression nadir is elevated. In contrast, Rev-erbα expression remains relatively unaffected by TURP treatment. Co-treatment with the anti-inflammatory agent IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) did not alter the response of Per2 to TURP treatment in liver, despite the reduced induction of fever and IL-6 serum levels. This indicates that the TURP-mediated changes of Per2 in the liver might be due to factors other than systemic IL-6 and fever. Accordingly, IL-6 treatment had no effect on clock gene expression in HepG2 liver carcinoma cells. Altogether, we show that localized inflammation causes significant time-dependent changes in peripheral circadian clock gene expression, via a mechanism likely involving mediators independent from IL-6 and fever."

Although several well described cases have been reported for these evolutionary scenarios, the extent to which sequences of TE origin become useful for the host is unclear. Recent studies show that in the human genome, the total amount of functional, conserved sequence is much higher (5%) than the amount of coding sequence (1.5%), and recent results from the ENCODE project (5ENCODE Project Consortium Dunham I.

However, in the case of domesticated TE proteins, estimates range from a few dozen to thousands, depending on how conservative the analysis was: the human genome project found 47 proteins with significant similarity to TEs (7Lander E.S.

Bork P. Protein coding potential of retroviruses and other transposable elements in vertebrate genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 946-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) found only 35 proteins of retroviral/retrotransposon origin in mammals, whereas a considerably more relaxed analysis (9Britten R. Transposable elements have contributed to thousands of human proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1798-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) estimated that the human genome itself contains almost 2000 proteins that contain remains of TEs. The key difficulty in identifying the actual number is that a very large fraction of the TE-like protein hits are in the “twilight zone” and show only remote similarity to a TE sequence; thus, they are either false positives or highly diverged, ancient cases of TE domestication where sequence similarity has deteriorated to the degree that it is barely detectable. One alternative approach is to use protein structures to identify distant homologs: the structures of proteins are typically much more conserved than their sequences; homologous protein sequences that have lost almost all sequence similarity can show a very high degree of structural similarity (although separating homologs from structural analogs in such cases is challenging because of the level of divergence overlap in the two), and protein sequences above 35% identity are typically structurally similar (10Tramontano A. Protein Structure Prediction: Concepts and Applications. 1st Ed. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2006: 37-39Google Scholar). This work has two goals: (i) first, since a general structural characterization of proteins encoded by TEs is lacking, the first aim is to predict and characterize a representative set of TE structures, to identify common patterns among them like the overrepresentation of certain folds, their age, or signatures of selection that appear at the structural level. Because the number of experimentally solved TE protein structures is still very low, we used in silico methods and predicted the structures of DNA transposon and LINE proteins with I-TASSER, the protein structure prediction software that performed best in the last three CASP (critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction) experiments (11Roy A. Kucukural A. Zhang Y. I-TASSER: a unified platform for automated protein structure and function prediction.Nat Protoc. 2010; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4668) Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. I-TASSER server for protein 3D structure prediction.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (3867) Google Scholar). (ii) Second, our aim was to estimate the contribution of TE proteins to non-TE proteins, and we searched a recently published large-scale database of predicted protein structures (13Drew K. Winters P. Butterfoss G.L. Berstis V. Uplinger K. Armstrong J. Riffle M. Schweighofer E. Bovermann B. Goodlett D.R. Davis T.N. Shasha D. Malmström L. Bonneau R. The Proteome Folding Project: Proteome-scale prediction of structure and function.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 1981-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for proteins with structural and sequence homology to transposable elements and estimated the most likely evolutionary process that resulted in the observed homologies. We selected a representative set of TE proteins for the structure prediction as follows. First, we selected all DNA transposons and LINE retrotransposons from the RepBase Database (version 15.12) (14Jurka J. Kapitonov V.V. Pavlicek A. Klonowski P. Kohany O. Walichiewicz J. Repbase Update, a database of eukaryotic repetitive elements.Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2005; 110: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar) that were annotated as currently active, or their divergence from the consensus sequence was less than 3% and were thus active recently. Because the structure of proteins with sequence similarity higher than 35% is approximately similar, we clustered the selected proteins using a 35% identity threshold with UCLUST (15Edgar R.C. Search and clustering orders of magnitude faster than BLAST.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 2460-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (13927) Google Scholar) and folded only the longest element of each cluster. In LINE retrotransposons, the ORF2 proteins show a much higher similarity to each other than ORF1 proteins (16Malik H.S. Burke W.D. Eickbush T.H. The age and evolution of non-LTR retrotransposable elements.Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), thus restricted the clustering to ORF2 proteins. Altogether, this procedure resulted in a set of 222 DNA transposon proteins and 232 LINE proteins, representing all major families of these repeats, including widely used transposon tools such as the hyperactive Sleeping Beauty (17Mátés L. Chuah M.K. Belay E. Jerchow B. Manoj N. Acosta-Sanchez A. Grzela D.P. Schmitt A. Becker K. Matrai J. Ma L. Samara-Kuko E. Gysemans C. Pryputniewicz D. Miskey C. Fletcher B. VandenDriessche T. Ivics Z. Izsvák Z. Molecular evolution of a novel hyperactive Sleeping Beauty transposase enables robust stable gene transfer in vertebrates.Nat.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) transposases. In silico structure prediction is still most efficient for relatively short proteins. In many cases, the amino acid sequences of TEs were too long for building a reliable structure (i.e. the ORF2 proteins of LINEs, which are typically 1000–1400 amino acids long); thus, we split every protein longer than 500 residues into smaller regions, with a maximum length of 400–500 residues, which typically still contain several domains. First, we identified conserved domains in the amino acid sequences using the conserved domain search tool of NCBI (19Marchler-Bauer A. Lu S. Anderson J.B. Chitsaz F. Derbyshire M.K. DeWeese-Scott C. Fong J.H. Geer L.Y. Geer R.C. Gonzales N.R. Gwadz M. Hurwitz D.I. Jackson J.D. Ke Z. Lanczycki C.J. Lu F. Marchler G.H. Mullokandov M. Omelchenko M.V. Robertson C.L. Song J.S. Thanki N.

CDD: a Conserved Domain Database for the functional annotation of proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D225-D229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar). Next, we predicted domain boundaries with a method based on the domain prediction tool FiefDom (20Bondugula R. Lee M.S. Wallqvist A. FIEFDom: a transparent domain boundary recognition system using a fuzzy mean operator.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, FiefDom generates a PSSM using a query sequence and a reference database (nr) and searches for domain boundaries using the distribution of hits from a structure database (SCOP (21Andreeva A. Howorth D. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J. Chothia C. Murzin A.G. Data growth and its impact on the SCOP database: new developments.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D419-D425Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) or PDB (22Berman H. Henrick K. Nakamura H. Markley J.L. The worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB): ensuring a single, uniform archive of PDB data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D301-D303Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar)). Combining the coordinates of conserved domains and the distribution of SCOP/PDB hits on the TE protein sequence, we identified domain boundaries at the regions with the lowest sequence coverage, and when these boundaries collided with conserved domains, we adjusted them manually (Fig. 1). We split the proteins at the identified domain boundaries, and the resulting sequences, altogether 870 (see supplemental Table 1), were subsequently submitted to I-TASSER (11Roy A. Kucukural A. Zhang Y. I-TASSER: a unified platform for automated protein structure and function prediction.Nat Protoc. 2010; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4668) Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. I-TASSER server for protein 3D structure prediction.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (3867) Google Scholar). Detailed descriptions of I-TASSER can be found in Refs. 11Roy A. Kucukural A. Zhang Y. I-TASSER: a unified platform for automated protein structure and function prediction.Nat Protoc. 2010; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4668) Google Scholar and 12Zhang Y. I-TASSER server for protein 3D structure prediction.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (3867) Google Scholar. Briefly, I-TASSER first identifies suitable templates in the PDB database through sequence similarity searches (threading); second, using Monte Carlo simulations, the identified templates and regions modeled with ab initio methods are assembled into a large number of full-length conformations; third, by clustering the conformations, cluster centroids are identified, and the final models are built by additional refinements of the cluster centroids. All predicted structures are available for download as supplemental material. The C score of the predicted structures is the combination of the quality of the threading alignments (Z score) and the density of the clusters, and is defined by the formula shown in Equation 1, C−score=ln[Z×(Ncl/Ntot)×(1/RMSD)](Eq. 1) where Z is the normalized Z score, Ncl is the number of conformations in a given cluster, Ntot is the total number of conformations used in the clustering, and r.m.s.d. is the average root mean square deviation of the trajectories from the cluster centroid in a given cluster. The local C score of domains was calculated using the same formula; first, we calculated the local r.m.s.d. for every amino acid position of the sequence, as the r.m.s.d. between a particular position of the cluster centroid sequence and the corresponding position of every conformation in the cluster. Next, we identified regions where the local r.m.s.d. was consistently below 5 Å (see Fig. 2, in cases where the average local r.m.s.d. of a structure was below 2 Å, we used a 3.5 Å cut-off) and reran the clustering only for these regions. Another measure of the quality of a predicted structure is its estimated TM score. TM score measures the similarity between two structures (23Zhang Y. Skolnick J. Scoring function for automated assessment of protein structure template quality.Proteins. 2004; 57: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar); the estimated TM score is calculated from C score and estimates the similarity of a predicted structure to its experimentally determined structure (see Ref. 12Zhang Y. I-TASSER server for protein 3D structure prediction.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (3867) Google Scholar for details). A rule of thumb is that the quality of a structure prediction is good if the estimated TM score is at least 0.5. To provide a functional characterization of the TE proteins, we searched the SCOP database (21Andreeva A. Howorth D. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J. Chothia C. Murzin A.G. Data growth and its impact on the SCOP database: new developments.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D419-D425Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) to identify domains that are similar to the predicted TE proteins with a minimum TM score of 0.5. We searched SCOP for structurally similar domains, excluding the sequences with higher sequence similarity than 95% (ASTRAL95) in an all versus all manner: all TE structures were compared with all SCOP structures with TMfold (24Xu J. Zhang Y. How significant is a protein structure similarity with TM-score = 0.5?.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). From the hits, we kept only those with a TM score higher than 0.5 and a minimum number of aligned residues higher than 80, as the probabilistic background of detecting shorter matches is not well understood (24Xu J. Zhang Y. How significant is a protein structure similarity with TM-score = 0.5?.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Because there is large structural redundancy within SCOP domains, we applied a further filtering step; from the overlapping SCOP matches, we kept only those most similar to the query TE structure, i.e. with the highest TM score, and the highest number of aligned residues closer than 5 Å. This step removed the redundant hits and resulted in 403 different SCOP hits to DNA transposon structures and 521 SCOP domains that are similar to LINE structures (see supplemental Tables 3 and 4). The enrichment of SCOP protein folds in TE structures (supplemental Table 5) was calculated as the ratio of the frequency of a fold in the TE structures and the frequency of the corresponding fold in the Uniprot database (25UniProt Consortium Ongoing and future developments at the Universal Protein Resource.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D214-D219Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). For the latter, only those folds were used in the normalization which also occurred in TEs, i.e. the most common folds of TEs. This is necessary because Uniprot, due to its size, contains a much higher diversity of protein folds than a comparatively small set a proteins, and in consequence, the frequency of a particular fold in Uniprot is necessarily much lower if all folds are used in the normalization, which would result in a systematic overestimation of the enrichment in TEs. The abundances of particular folds in Uniprot were taken from the SUPERFAMILY database (26Wilson D. Pethica R. Zhou Y. Talbot C. Vogel C. Madera M. Chothia C. Gough J. SUPERFAMILY–sophisticated comparative genomics, data mining, visualization and phylogeny.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D380-D386Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Because the frequencies of low resolution protein structures (SCOP ID i.NN) are not present in the SUPERFAMILY database, these were not included in the analysis. We used the TE structures to provide an estimate of the frequency of TE domestication events using a recently published database of the Proteome Folding Project (PFP) (13Drew K. Winters P. Butterfoss G.L. Berstis V. Uplinger K. Armstrong J. Riffle M. Schweighofer E. Bovermann B. Goodlett D.R. Davis T.N. Shasha D. Malmström L. Bonneau R. The Proteome Folding Project: Proteome-scale prediction of structure and function.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 1981-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The database contains structural annotation of proteins on a genome scale from more than 94 organisms and provided novel structure predictions for 80,000 protein domains, which could not be annotated with SCOP, predicted with the Rosetta de novo structure prediction algorithm (28Das R. Baker D. Macromolecular modeling with rosetta.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 363-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 29Leaver-Fay A. Tyka M. Lewis S.M. Lange O.F. Thompson J. Jacak R.

ROSETTA3: an object-oriented software suite for the simulation and design of macromolecules.Methods Enzymol. 2011; 487: 545-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). This data set is useful for detecting ancient TE homologies for two reasons: first, because de novo Rosetta does not use PDB templates for model building, the structural similarities are independent of the model building procedure of I-TASSER, i.e. any similarities are not due to using the same PDB structure as a template; second, due to the large number of organisms included in the PFP data set, it is possible to gain also information on the evolution/life style of organisms having proteins with TE homology. Rosetta predicts an ensemble of structures for each submitted sequence; we used the structure with the highest quality score (Mammoth Confidence Metric, MCM) (30Malmström L. Riffle M. Strauss C.E. Chivian D. Davis T.N. Bonneau R. Baker D. Superfamily assignments for the yeast proteome through integration of structure prediction with the gene ontology.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e76Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) for each domain and also excluded all domains where the highest MCM score was below 0.8; thus, the model was of low quality (13Drew K. Winters P. Butterfoss G.L. Berstis V. Uplinger K. Armstrong J. Riffle M. Schweighofer E. Bovermann B. Goodlett D.R. Davis T.N. Shasha D. Malmström L. Bonneau R. The Proteome Folding Project: Proteome-scale prediction of structure and function.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 1981-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This reduced the set of PFP structures used in the analysis to 16 000. We used the same all versus all approach for structural similarity searches as with the SCOP database (minimum required TM score of 0.5 and minimum length of aligned residues of 80). We tested whether the TE structures with similar topology (TM score > 0.5) to a PFP structure show any, at least remote sequence homology with a randomization procedure. Using a substitution matrix explicitly derived for homologous structures with remote sequence similarity (31Prlić A. Domingues F.S. Sippl M.J. Structure-derived substitution matrices for alignment of distantly related sequences.Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we calculated a sequence similarity score for the TE-PFP structural alignments obtained by TMfold. Next, we calculated 100,000 similarity scores between the TE sequence and random sequences, where the probability of selecting an amino acid for the random sequence was similar to the frequency of the amino acid in the PFP database. Significance was calculated with the formula shown in Equation 2, p=(n+1)/(N+1)(Eq. 2) where n is the number of random alignment scores equal or higher than that of the TE-PFP alignment, and N is the total number of random samples (100,000). Structure pairs with p < = 0.001 were accepted as homologous, whereas pairs with p > 0.001 were assumed to be analogous. The enrichment of particular taxonomic groups in the PFP homologs in comparison with the entire Proteome Folding Project database (Table 1) was calculated as the ratio of frequencies in the TE hits and their frequencies in the PFP database, and statistical significance was calculated with Chi square tests.TABLE 1Taxonomic distribution of TE hits to the PFP database (both sequence- and structure-based searches) and their over- or under-representationTaxonomic groupStructure hitsEnrichmentpSequence hitsEnrichmentpNr in databaseMobile elements41.520.4001741.305<0.001145Viruses, phages30.350.05200.0000.240473Prokaryotes1270.860.02010.044<0.0018076Protists461.63<0.00110.2280.0891547Fungi180.930.73510.3300.2271068Metazoans521.220.12860.8990.7782351Plants450.970.830202.768<0.0012546Total2954616,206 Open table in a new tab To decide whether the homology between a PFP protein domain and the sequence of a TE is the effect of transposon domestication or a different process, e.g. the incorporation of a host protein fragment into a TE, we implemented a protocol similar to Ref. 32Abrusán G. Szilágyi A. Zhang Y. Papp B. Turning gold into ‘junk’: transposable elements utilize central proteins of cellular networks.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 3190-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. First, we reconstructed a global taxonomic tree of ∼180,000 taxa, using known taxonomic relationships defined by NCBI. Next, using the sequences from a homologous sequence pair of a PFP protein and a transposable element, we searched the Uniprot database with the sequence fragment of the PFP protein using the jackhmmer tool of HMMER (33Johnson L.S. Eddy S.R. Portugaly E. Hidden Markov model speed heuristic and iterative HMM search procedure.BMC Bioinformatics. 2010; 11: 431Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) with a bit score threshold 27. Using the species of the resulting matches, we identified the branch of the global tree where the particular domain is present. We repeated the same procedure for the TE fragment, using the six-frame translated RepBase as the sequence database, and then compared the two branches. The branch that contains the other was assumed to be the source of the sequence; for example, if a TE domain was present in repeats across Metazoans, whereas the homologous PFP domain was restricted to primates, we then concluded that this is a signature of the domestication of a TE protein in primates. If, however, the phylogenetic distribution of the PFP was broader than that of the distribution of the TE domain we concluded that a host protein was incorporated into a TE. In cases where the two branches were unrelated (for example mammals and parasitic protists), we assumed horizontal transfer. As the first step of the structural analysis, we identified the regions of the TEs that lack structure: the intrinsically disordered parts of the sequences. Intrinsically disordered proteins are proteins, or regions of proteins, which, in their native state, have no stable structure, except in the presence of their substrate or in complex. The existence of short, flexible regions in proteins that link rigid globular domains has been known for decades. In the last decade, however, it has been discovered that in some proteins, a large fraction of the sequence or even the entire sequence has no well defined tertiary structure in its native, functional form (34Dyson H.J.

A recombinant MoCel7B prepared by overexpression in M. oryzae exhibited endo-typical depolymerization of polysaccharides containing β-1,4-linkages, in which 1,3–1,4-β-glucan was the best substrate. When cellooligosaccharides were used as the substrate, the recombinant enzyme generated reaction products with both shorter and longer chain lengths than the substrate. In addition, incorporation of glucose and various oligosaccharides including sulforhodamine-conjugated cellobiose, laminarioligosaccharides, gentiobiose, xylobiose, mannobiose, and xyloglucan nonasaccharide into β-1,4-linked glucans were observed after incubation with the enzyme. These results indicate that the recombinant enzyme acts as an endotransglucosylase (ETG) that cleaves the glycosidic bond of β-1,4-glucan as a donor substrate and transfers the cleaved glucan chain to another molecule functioning as an acceptor substrate. Furthermore, ETG treatment caused greater extension of heat-treated wheat coleoptiles. The result suggests that ETG functions to induce wall loosening by cleaving the 1,3–1,4-β-glucan tethers of plant cell walls. On the other hand, use of cellohexaose as a substrate for ETG resulted in the production of cellulose II with a maximum length (degree of polymerization) of 26 glucose units. Thus, ETG functions to depolymerize and polymerize β-glucans, depending on the size of the acceptor substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2009377536,"The stuttering interneurons (STi) represent one minor subset of interneuron population and exhibit characteristic stuttering firing upon depolarization current injection. While it has been long held that the GABAergic inhibitory transmission largely varies with the subtype identity of presynaptic interneurons, whether such a rule also applies to STi is largely unknown. Here, by paired recording of interneuron and their neighboring projection neuron in lateral amygdala, we found that relative to the fast spiking and late spiking interneurons, the STi-evoked unitary postsynaptic currents onto the projection neurons had markedly larger amplitude, shorter onset latency and faster rising and decay kinetics. The quantal content and the number of vesicles in the readily releasable pool were also larger in synapses made by STi versus other interneurons. Moreover, the short-term plasticity, as reflected by the paired pulse depression and depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, was the least prominent in the output synapses of STi. Thus, the fast and robust inhibition together with its low capacity of short term modulation may suggest an important role for STi in preventing the overexcitation of the projection neurons and thus gating the information traffic in amygdala."
https://openalex.org/W2046814992,"Human-machine interface (HMI) designs offer the possibility of improving quality of life for patient populations as well as augmenting normal user function. Despite pragmatic benefits, utilizing auditory feedback for HMI control remains underutilized, in part due to observed limitations in effectiveness. The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which categorical speech perception could be used to improve an auditory HMI. Using surface electromyography, 24 healthy speakers of American English participated in 4 sessions to learn to control an HMI using auditory feedback (provided via vowel synthesis). Participants trained on 3 targets in sessions 1-3 and were tested on 3 novel targets in session 4. An ""established categories with text cues"" group of eight participants were trained and tested on auditory targets corresponding to standard American English vowels using auditory and text target cues. An ""established categories without text cues"" group of eight participants were trained and tested on the same targets using only auditory cuing of target vowel identity. A ""new categories"" group of eight participants were trained and tested on targets that corresponded to vowel-like sounds not part of American English. Analyses of user performance revealed significant effects of session and group (established categories groups and the new categories group), and a trend for an interaction between session and group. Results suggest that auditory feedback can be effectively used for HMI operation when paired with established categorical (native vowel) targets with an unambiguous cue."
