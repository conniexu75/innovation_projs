https://openalex.org/W1979982113,"Some quantum yields for the destruction of amino acids have been determined. The inactivation of the enzymes hymotrypsin, lysozyme, ribonuclease, and trypsin by ultraviolet light can be accounted for quantitatively by summing the products of (i) the probability that light is absorbed by a given amino acid residue, epsilon(4), and (ii) the probability that absorbed light induces a chemical change, with a quantum efficiency phi(4), in the residue. The principal residues involved are cystyl and tryptophanyl. Peptide bond rupture is not important. Analysis of inactivated enzymes verifies the assumption of the existence of several inactivation mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2039609146,"THIS communication deals with work on the effect of magnetic field on living ascites tumour cells in vitro. The hanging-drop culture was prepared by diluting a 7-day-old transplanted ascites mouse tumour with suitable aliquots of Tyrode solution. The culture slide to be exposed to the field was then placed between the poles of an Alnico permanent magnet in a horizontal position at a constant temperature of 37° C. The field strength used during the experiment was about 4,000 gauss and was determined independently by the susceptibility technique. The control slides not exposed to the field were treated identically. The microscopic examination of the slides was carried out periodically."

https://openalex.org/W2029745372,"10-Methoxyharmalan, an alkaloid obtained by the cyclodehydration of melatonin, itself a derivative of serotonin, is a more potent serotonin antagonist than harmaline and is only slightly less active than lysergic acid diethylamide. It has a similar, yet slightly greater, effect on behavior as that of harmaline and is the most potent serotonin derivative, so far tested, that affects the avoidance-escape behavioral reflex"
https://openalex.org/W2037490812,"RECENT results of in vivo experiments using glutamic acid labelled with carbon-14 were consistent with the hypothesis that the amidation of the administered amino-acid to glutamine represents a metabolic event occurring in a tissue or cellular compartment1,2. Since glutamic acid and glutamine syntheses in the central nervous system are the two known processes by which ammonia enters organic linkage, it appeared of great interest to approach the question of setting into compartments the metabolism of glutamic acid and its derivatives with the aid of ammonia labelled with nitrogen-15."

Variations in the amplitude of the response after surgery indicate that the participation of these muscles in habituation, conditioning, and distraction must be minimal."

https://openalex.org/W2018152669,"THIS communication reports the identification of two new alkaloids, related structurally and perhaps biosynthetically to gramine. Shoots of 4-day-old barley seedlings were extracted with trichloracetic acid. The centrifuged solution was extracted with ethyl ether, made alkaline and re-extracted. The ether extract of the alkaline solution was dried and concentrated. Aliquot s were chromatographed using paper impregnated with a mixture of 0.2 M dipotassium hydrogen phosphate and 0.03 volume of 01 M citric acid1 and developed with isopropanol equilibrated with 0.29 volume of the same buffer. Sprayed with Millon's reagent1, the chromatograms showed a strong gramine spot, and two spots called here compounds A and B and identified by the evidence below as 3-aminomethylmdole and 3-methyl-aminomethylindole respectively. In addition, there was an unidentified spot."

The results demonstrate an adaptation to morphine at the cellular level which is concomitant with the adaptation of the whole animal to morphine"

https://openalex.org/W1971084256,"THE guinea pig lymphocyte has long been known to contain a special inclusion body. Such lymphocytes, called Kurloff cells after their discoverer, increase greatly in number in pregnancy and were shown by Ledingham1 to be produced in both malesand females by administration of œstrogens. Marshall and Swettenham2, by histochemical methods, have shown that the inclusion body is composed of a mucoprotein–sulphated mucopolysaccharide complex. Further work on the chemistry of a mucopolysaccharide fraction by extraction of spleens of œstrogen-treated guinea pigs gave the following results:"
https://openalex.org/W1964213737,"WHEN blood cells from an adult fowl are inoculated on the chorioallantoic membrane of the 12-day-chick embryo, easily visible opaque foci are produced1,2. This reaction is thought to be similar to the induction of splenomegaly following intravenous inoculation of adult fowl blood into the chick embryo3. The cells in blood responsible for this latter action have been found to be the lymphocytes4. Fowls are typical of the avian family in having a high proportion of circulating large lymphocytes, usually about 10 per cent, and, as autoradiographic investigations5,6 have shown that large lymphocytes and not small can synthesize deoxyribonucleic acid and proliferate, an investigation was made to determine the type of lymphocyte responsible for the induction of lesions on the chorioallantoic membrane. Blood from a group of 25 random fowls was titrated on the chorioallantoic membrane, the number of small and of large lymphocytes in the inoculated blood having been determined. A highly significant correlation (0.1 per cent in Student's t test) of the number of large lymphocytes in the inoculum with the median focal count was demonstrated. The correlation of small lymphocytes with the focal count was not significant (> 5 per cent). In repeated titrations of individual fowls, the focal count was also shown to depend on the number of large lymphocytes in the inoculum and to be quite independent of the number of small lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1971899446,"The Emerson effect was observed as an enhancement of photosynthesis in long-wavelength red light when beams of shorter wavelength were added. Two light beams of wavelengths 650 and 694 mmicro, respectively, when presented together, gave a photosynthetic rate higher than the sum of the rates obtained separately. The amount of enhancement of photosynthesis depends upon the growth conditions of algal cells, and specifically on their phosphate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1493884516,"HÆMOGLOBIN E- thalassæmia disease represents a double heterozygous state with reference to genes for hæmoglobin E and thalassæmia. Studies on glutathione stability which have recently provided valuable information regarding the cause of hæmolysis as it occurs in drug-induced hæmolytic anæmia and in hereditary non-spherocytic hæmolytic anæmia have not so far been done in hæmoglobin E – thalassæmia disease. In the present communication, 20 cases of hæmoglobin E – thalassæmia disease were investigated with reference to the behaviour of their erythrocytically reduced glutathione-level when incubated in vitro with acetylphenylhydrazine. The relevant features of these 20 cases are given in Table 1."
https://openalex.org/W2042730455,"WE have examined a streptomycin-producing strain of Streptomyces griseus 1 and two mutants derived from it which did not produce streptomycin. The two mutants arose by treatment with mustard nitrogen2. They were isolated as a single colony by the method previously described3. Out of 1,387 Streptomyces griseus colonies grown from single spores after treatment with mustard nitrogen there appeared 33 non-producing colonies. Only two of them remained stable non-producers after being transferred several times. Their cultural and physiological characteristics differed from the parent strain."
