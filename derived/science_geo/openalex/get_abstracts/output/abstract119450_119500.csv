https://openalex.org/W2072410510,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades represent one of the major signal systems used by eukaryotic cells to transduce extracellular signals into cellular responses. Four MAP kinase subgroups have been identified in humans: ERK, JNK (SAPK), ERK5 (BMK), and p38. Here we characterize a new MAP kinase, p38β. p38β is a 372-amino acid protein most closely related to p38. It contains a TGY dual phosphorylation site, which is required for its kinase activity. Like p38, p38β is activated by proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stress. A comparison of events associated with the activation of p38β and p38 revealed differences, most notably in the preferred activation of p38β by MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6), whereas p38 was activated nearly equally by MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed a strong substrate preference by p38β for activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2). Enhancement of ATF2-dependent gene expression by p38β was ∼20-fold greater than that of p38 and other MAP kinases tested. The data reported here suggest that while closely related, p38β and p38 may be regulated by differing mechanisms and may exert their actions on separate downstream targets.

Minden A. Karin M. Zon L.I. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Google Scholar). One member of the MAP kinase family, p38, was first identified from studies involving lipopolysaccharide (LPS, or endotoxin), a complex glycolipid found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (6Han J. Lee J.D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25009-25014Google Scholar). Further studies have shown that p38 activation can be observed not only in LPS-treated macrophages, but also in cells treated with cell wall components from Gram-positive bacteria, proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), physical stress such as high osmolarity, and chemical stress such as H2O2 (7Han J.

Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Google Scholar). An important role of p38 activation in the LPS-induced inflammatory response was established from its specific inhibition by a class of pyridinyl imidazoles that includes SB 202190 (11Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fischer S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar). In vivo, administration of this drug to mice blocked LPS-induced TNF and IL-1β production. In vitro, SB 202190 inhibited p38 phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) but had no effect on the activity of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK, or stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)). Thus, p38 activation may be essential for some cellular responses associated with acute or chronic inflammation. mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (or stress-activated protein kinase) JNK kinase extracellular-regulated protein kinase activating transcription factor 2 hemagglutinin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin myelin basic protein phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-2(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-imidazole glutathione S-transferase Chinese hamster ovary lipopolysaccharide MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2. Several upstream kinases have been implicated in the activation of p38. In co-transfection experiments, p38 was activated by the dual specificity kinases, MAP kinase kinase 3 (MKK3), MKK4, and MKK6 (12Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C.

Low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins RAC1 and Cdc42 also were shown to regulate p38 activation when co-expressed in several cultured cell lines (15Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J.

Potential substrates of p38, identified from in vitro kinase assays, may be MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2) and ATF2 (8Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J.

However, very little is known about the substrate targets of activated p38 under physiological conditions. Sequence comparison of p38 with other MAP kinases identified a Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) dual phosphorylation motif in p38. The other MAP kinases have Thr-Glu-Tyr (TEY) or Thr-Pro-Tyr (TPY) dual phosphorylation motifs (7Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Google Scholar, 17Davis R.J.

Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12664-12669Google Scholar). All three phosphorylation motifs are part of the linker loop 12 region (24Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-710Google Scholar) defined by analysis of the three-dimensional crystal structure of ERK2. The length of this loop varies among the different MAP kinases (22Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Google Scholar). The phosphorylation motif and linker loop 12 length are the structural features used to divide the MAP kinase family members into four subgroups: 1) ERK, 2) JNK (SAPK), 3) ERK5 (BMK), and 4) p38. Isoforms of the ERK and JNK MAP kinase subgroups have been identified (1Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Google Scholar, 2Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem.

Gene Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Google Scholar). Here we describe the molecular cloning of a new MAP kinase, p38β. The protein p38β appears to be an isoform of p38 in that it is 74% identical to p38, has the TGY dual phosphorylation motif, and has the same linker loop 12 length. Despite their structural similarities, p38β displays considerably more activity toward ATF2 than p38 does in vitro. Consistent with this observation, we found that overexpression of p38β but not p38 potentiates the expression of an ATF2-dependent reporter gene. p38β and p38 also respond differently to upstream kinases and some extracellular stimuli. The present findings help us to understand how p38β and p38 may regulate cellular responses to a variety of extracellular signals. The oligonucleotide ATCCAGTTGAGCATGATCTCAGGTGC was 3′-end 32P-labeled with a 3′-end-labeling system (Promega, Madison, WI) and used to screen a λZAPII human placenta library purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). 1 × 106 phage were screened as described (14Han J. Lee J.-D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Google Scholar). Clones isolated from the screen were sequenced using a kit from U.S. Biochemical Corp. The original clone (Clone ID, 156272) from the Washington University-Merck Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) project was sequenced using a model 373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A tissue blot containing 2 µg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from different human tissues, fractionated by denaturing agarose gel, and transferred onto a nylon membrane was purchased from Clontech (San Francisco, CA). The blot was hybridized to a probe prepared by labeling the coding region of p38β cDNA with [γ-32P]dATP by random priming (25Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Google Scholar). After autoradiography, the blot was reprobed with [γ-32P]dATP-labeled p38 cDNA. Hybridization was performed overnight at 50°C using 50% formamide, 5 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 5 × Denhardt's, 1% SDS, and 200 µg/ml single-stranded fish sperm. The blot was washed 2 times with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mM EDTA and once with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA at 65°C prior to autoradiography. A p38β double mutant (p38β(AF)) was created by substituting Thr188 with Ala and Tyr190 with Phe using a PCR-based procedure (26Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Shinsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177Google Scholar). The flag epitope tag DYKDDDDK was added to the amino-terminal region by PCR recombination as described for p38 (14Han J. Lee J.-D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Google Scholar). The cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). For p38β expression in bacteria, the cDNA coding region was subcloned into the pET14b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). MKK3 and MKK4 (JNKK1/SEK1) with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in pSRα vector were constructed as described (12Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Google Scholar, 27Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Google Scholar). HA-tagged MKK6 cDNA is in the pcDNA3 vector (14Han J. Lee J.-D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Google Scholar). A PCR-based procedure was used to create a double mutant of MKK3 (MKK3(E)) by replacing the phosphorylation sites Ser189 and Thr193 with Glu, a double mutant of MKK6 (MKK6(E)) by replacing Ser151 and Thr155 with Glu, and a double mutant of MKK6b (MKK6b(E)) by replacing Ser207 and Thr211 with Glu. The cDNAs were subcloned into vector pcDNA3. The pET14b vectors containing p38β or p38 were transformed into the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli. The E. coli was grown at 37°C in Luria broth until the A600 = 1.0 at which time isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mM final) was added for 2 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min. For 100 ml of original bacterial culture, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.9). The bacteria were lysed by sonication using a cell disrupter (W-375, Ultrasonics, Inc). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Novagen) column (0.5 ml), the column was washed with 10 ml of 50 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and the bound protein was eluted with 1 M imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.9. The expressed p38β and p38 proteins were soluble and were recovered with a yield of 10 µg/ml of bacteria culture. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were >90% pure. The expression of p38β or p38 proteins in COS-7 cells was achieved as follows. COS-7 cells (1 × 106) grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum were transfected with 5 µg of mammalian expression vectors containing flag-tagged p38β or p38 cDNA using lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). After 48 h, cells were chilled to 4°C and lysed by incubating for 15 min in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 10 min. Flag-tagged protein was purified from the cell lysate by immunoprecipitation. The anti-flag monoclonal antibody M2 (IBI-Kodak) was prebound to protein G-Sepharose beads at a concentration of 2 µg of antibody/µl of beads. Cell lysate (300 µl) prepared as described above was added to 20 µl of a 50% suspension of beads and gently shaken for 3-10 h at 4°C. The beads were washed 2 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and 2 times with 0.5 ml of kinase reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mM MgCl2, 25 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, and 2 mM dithiothreitol). The presence of the epitope-tagged proteins in the immunoprecipitates was confirmed by Western blot analysis with M2 (15Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were kept at 4°C and used in the kinase assays within 2 days. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of the amino-terminal portion of ATF2 (base pairs 1-109) (14Han J. Lee J.-D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Google Scholar), c-Jun (1-93) (21Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar), and full-length MAPKAPK2 (28Zu Y.-L. Wu F. Gilchrist A. Ai Y. Labadia M.E. Huang C.-K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1118-1124Google Scholar) were prepared as described (29Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar) by affinity chromatography over GSH-agarose (Sigma). MBP was purchased from Sigma. COS-7, HeLa, and CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells on 35-mm plates were transiently transfected with 1 µg (total) of plasmid DNA using lipofectamine. After 48 h, the cells were treated with stimuli as described in the text. Transfection efficiency was evaluated by co-transfection with plasmid pCMVβ (Clontech). Cell lysates were normalized for transfection efficiency by quantifying β-galactosidase activity (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays were carried out at 37°C for 30 min using 0.2 µg of recombinant kinase, 5 µg of kinase substrate, 250 µM ATP, and 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 20 µl of kinase reaction buffer. Reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Reaction products were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. In vivo kinase activity of transiently expressed p38β, p38β(AF), or p38 in HeLa cells was measured by an immunokinase assay with M2 as described (21Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar). We evaluated the in vitro inhibition of p38β by the pyridinyl imidazole derivative, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-imidazole (FHPI), which is identical to the published compound SB202190 of SmithKline Beecham (King of Prussia, PA) (11Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fischer S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar). Inhibition was evaluated by adding different concentrations of this compound to the in vitro kinase reaction. The GAL4-responsive reporter plasmid, pG5E1bLuc, contains five GAL4 sites cloned upstream of a minimal promotor and luciferase gene (31Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar). pG5E1bLuc was co-transfected into CHO cells with a construct encoding the GAL4 binding domain fused to the ATF2-(1-505) (31Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar), Elk-1-(307-428) (32Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Google Scholar), or c-Jun-(1-223) (33Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Gene Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Google Scholar). Activation of these transcription factors by p38β or p38 was examined by co-transfection with these plasmids as described above. To identify proteins related to p38, the EST division of GenBank™ data base was searched with the tblastn program. An EST-sequence of 223 base pairs (GenBank™ number R72662; Clone ID, 156272) was found encoding a peptide very similar to p38. A piece of this EST sequence most distinct from p38, ATCCAGTTGAGCATGATCTCAGGTGC, was chosen as a probe to screen a human placenta cDNA library. Two positive clones were isolated, and sequencing revealed that the two encoded the same protein. One clone contained a complete open reading frame, while the other contained the 3′ portion of the gene (base pairs 609-2170). It was ascertained from their sequence that the clones encoded a MAP kinase distinct from other known MAP kinases. The open reading frame of the newly cloned cDNA specifies a 372-amino acid polypeptide that is slightly larger than p38 (360 amino acids in length). The nucleotide and deduced protein sequence of the new MAP kinase, termed p38β, is shown in Fig. 1A. The different cDNA sequences of these two MAP kinases (about 70% identical) indicate that p38β and p38 are products of different genes. The protein sequence alignments of p38β and p38 are shown in Fig. 1B. p38β is ∼74% identical to p38 and 40-50% identical to other known MAP kinases. Progressive pairwise alignment comparison of MAP kinase family members (Fig. 1C) indicates that p38β and p38 are more closely related to each other than to other MAP kinases. In addition, p38β and p38 share key structural features. Both p38β and p38 contain the dual TGY phosphorylation motif between kinase domains VII and VIII and have the same of linker loop 12 length. Since these features were used to distinguished p38 from the ERK, JNK (SAPK), and BMK1 (ERK5) MAP kinase subgroups (17Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Google Scholar, 22Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Google Scholar), we propose that p38β and p38 be classified into the same MAP kinase subgroup. p38β differs from p38 most significantly in the region between kinase domains V and VI. Alignments of their amino acid sequence created two gaps in this region of 7 amino acids and 1 amino acid (Fig. 1B). We obtained and sequenced the EST clone 156272. This clone contains a portion of p38β cDNA (base pairs 53-707). Interestingly, this 156272 clone contains an 86-base pair insertion before base pair 325. 2The insertion sequence in EST clone 156272 is GTGAGCGGCGGGGCGGGCGAGGCAGCGGGGAGCGCGTTCGCGGTGGGGCGGTGGGGCCCTGTCCTGACCCCCTGACCCCGCCCCAG. Common features of introns, such as GT and AG dinucleotides at the ends, were found to suggest that this clone contains an unspliced intron. Otherwise this sequence would disrupt the mRNA by introducing an in-frame stop codon. To determine if this insertion was an intron, we made a mammalian expression plasmid containing flag-tagged p38β cDNA that contained the insertion and transfected it into COS-7 cells. We detected the expression of flag-p38β with the correct molecular mass of ∼42 kDa rather than ∼13 kDa, which would be the case if the mRNA containing the in-frame stop codon were translated (data not shown). However, when we did a PCR using human placenta cDNA to examine p38β cDNA, cDNAs containing this insertion were found several times. The incompletely spliced mRNA may be caused by unmatured mRNA in our preparation or represent a mechanism by which p38β protein expression is controlled. Northern hybridization shows that p38β mRNA is expressed in human brain, heart, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (Fig. 2A). The transcript length of p38β was ∼2.5 kilobases. Reprobing of the blot with p38 revealed a second transcript of 3.5 kilobases with similar tissue distribution (Fig. 2B). The distribution of p38β and p38 resembles the wide tissue distribution observed for other MAP kinase subgroups (21Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar, 33Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Gene Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation and substrate specificity of recombinant p38β and p38 from bacteria were compared. Both kinases were observed to autophosphorylate to the same extent (data not shown). In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that both p38β and p38 phosphorylate MBP, ATF2, and MAPKAPK2 but not c-Jun (Fig. 3). One difference observed between p38β and p38 was the extent of ATF2 phosphorylation. ATF2 was phosphorylated 5-fold higher by p38β than p38. One likely explanation is a higher substrate affinity of p38β for ATF2 relative to the ATF2 affinity of p38. Similar in vitro kinase results were obtained by using flag-tagged p38β and p38 immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-7 cells (data not shown). The pyridinyl imidazole derivative SB202190 previously was shown to inhibit p38 phosphorylation of MBP with no effect on the activity of the ERK or JNK MAP kinase subgroups (11Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fischer S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar). We observed that FHPI, which is an identical compound of SB202190, also inhibits the kinase activity of p38β (Fig. 4). The IC50 values for inhibition of p38β and p38 phosphorylation of ATF2 by this compound were 0.35 and 0.28 µM, respectively. Similar IC50 values were observed for inhibition of p38β and p38 phosphorylation of MBP and their autophosphorylation (data not shown). To determine if regulation of p38β activity occurs through the dual TGY phosphorylation site previously defined for p38 (8Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Google Scholar), the kinase activity of the mutant flag-tagged p38β(AF) was evaluated. Neither autophosphorylation nor phosphorylation of the kinase substrates ATF2 and MBP by p38β(AF) immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells was observed (data not shown). Thus, as with p38, Thr188 and Tyr190 are most likely the phosphorylation sites involved in regulating the kinase activity of p38β. Because p38β and p38 share a high degree of amino acid identity, we sought to determine if they are similarly regulated. We and others have shown that p38 is activated when a variety of cell types are stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines, bacteria pathogens, or chemical-physical stress (7Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Google Scholar, 8Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Google Scholar). To compare p38β with p38, we transiently expressed flag-tagged p38β and p38 in HeLa cells. We selected HeLa cells because they are easily transfected and previously had been used with p38 (8Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the cell extracts demonstrated the presence of equal levels of these proteins (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, p38β and p38 were similarly activated when the HeLa cells were treated with TNF-α, arsenite, anisomycin, high osmolarity, H2O2, or UV, whereas treatment with epidermal growth factor and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) had little or no effect on their activation. A considerable difference in activation was observed when IL-1β was used as a stimulus. After IL-1β simulation, p38 was activated ∼4-fold higher than p38β. This phenomenon was highly reproducible in all three experiments and cannot be attributed to variability in protein expression, since Western blot analysis of cell extracts consistently detected equal amounts of p38β and p38 (data not shown). The observed difference in IL-1β activation of p38β and p38 suggests p38β and p38 may be differentially regulated. To further compare the activation of p38β and p38, we evaluated the dose response and kinetics of the TNF-α-induced activation. Fig. 6 shows that while p38β and p38 have similar sensitivities to TNF-α, their activation kinetics are different. Fig. 6A shows that maximum activation of both p38β and p38 is observed between 10 and 100 ng/ml of TNF-α. Fig. 6B shows that maximum activation of p38β took twice as long as that of p38. Activation of p38β peaked at 30 min, whereas that of p38 peaked at 15 min. Distinct activation kinetics between p38β and p38 further support the idea that these kinases are differentially regulated. MAP kinases are activated by MAP kinase kinases (MKK or MEK), and substantial evidence exists that distinct MKK subsets activate specific MAP kinase subgroups (12Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H.

However, their increased expression does not always correlate with monocyte influx, suggesting other possible biological activities for this member of the C-C chemokine family. In view of its potential role in regulating extracellular matrix expression in fibrotic disorders, the effects of MCP-1 on lung fibroblast collagen expression were evaluated. Isolated rat lung fibroblasts were treated with increasing doses of MCP-1 for variable periods of time and examined for effects on collagen synthesis and expression of procollagen α1(I) mRNA expression. The results show that MCP-1 was able to stimulate collagen expression in these cells in a dose-dependent manner but required over 24 h for significant elevation to occur. In view of this delayed time course, the possibility of mediation via endogenous transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) was tested by the ability of anti-TGFβ antibody to inhibit this MCP-1 stimulation of collagen expression. Significant but incomplete inhibition by this antibody was observed. Pretreatment of the cells with antisense but not by sense or missense TGFβ1 oligodeoxyribonucleotides caused essentially complete inhibition of this MCP-1 stimulatory effect. Furthermore, MCP-1 treatment was found to also stimulate TGFβ secretion and mRNA expression, which was also abolished by pretreatment with antisense TGFβ1 oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The kinetics of TGFβ expression indicates that significant increase preceded that for collagen expression. Binding studies using 125I-labeled MCP-1 indicated the presence of specific and saturable binding sites with a dissociation constant consistent with the dose response curves for stimulation of fibroblast collagen synthesis and TGFβ activity by MCP-1. These results taken together suggest that MCP-1 stimulates fibroblast collagen expression via specific receptors and endogenous up-regulation of TGFβ expression. The latter then results in autocrine and/or juxtacrine stimulation of collagen gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2024285818,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is commonly associated with neurological disease that occurs in the apparent absence of extensive infection of brain cells by HIV, suggesting that indirect mechanisms account for neuropathogenesis in the CNS, perhaps including changes in the normal neuroprotective functions of astrocytes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), produced by HIV-1-infected macrophages and microglia, on glutamate transport by primary human fetal astrocytes (PHFAs). A dose-dependent inhibition of high affinity glutamate uptake sites was observed 12-24 h after addition of exogenous recombinant human TNFalpha to PHFAs. This effect was specific since it was blocked by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against TNFalpha. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect was reproduced by a monoclonal antibody that is an agonist at the 55-kDa TNF receptor. These results suggest that the neurotoxic effects of TNFalpha may be due in part to its ability to inhibit glutamate uptake by astrocytes, which in turn may result in excitotoxic concentrations of glutamate in synapses."

Consequently, phosphatidylserine and other lipids normally sequestered to the inner leaflet become exposed at the cell surface. This Ca2+-induced mobilization of phosphatidylserine to the surface of activated, injured, or apoptotic cells confers a procoagulant property to the plasma membrane, which promotes fibrin clotting and provides a signal for cell removal by the reticuloendothelial system. To identify the constituent of the membrane that mediates this Ca2+-dependent “PL scramblase” activity, we undertook purification and reconstitution of membrane component(s) with this activity from detergent extracts of erythrocyte ghosts depleted of cytoskeleton. Active fractions were identified by their capacity to mediate the Ca2+-dependent redistribution of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl-labeled PL between leaflets of reconstituted proteoliposomes. This PL scramblase activity co-eluted through multiple chromatographic steps with a single polypeptide of ∼37 kDa, which was purified to apparent homogeneity as resolved by silver staining. The activity associated with this protein band was inactivated by trypsin.

Recent studies have suggested that proteolytic cleavage and activation of the CPP32 protease may be functionally important in the induction of apoptosis (13Tewari M. Quan L.G. O'Rourke K.

In contrast to the death effector functions of CED-3/ICE family members, the bcl-2 gene family encodes several proteins that inhibit programmed cell death. In mammalian cells, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL inhibit cell death induced by diverse stimuli in many cell types (30Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M.

In C. elegans, the bcl-2 homologue, ced-9, inhibits ced-3-dependent cell death and is thus genetically a negative regulator of ced-3 (33Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 34Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). However, these genetic studies do not distinguish whether CED-9/Bcl-2 proteins act upstream of CED-3/ICE proteases to inhibit their activation or downstream to prevent the function of CED-3/ICE protease substrates (35Horvitz H.R. Shaham S. Hengartner M.O. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 111: 377-385Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the present report, we demonstrate that CPP32 is proteolytically activated in response to the cell death stimulus, Fas ligation. Activation of CPP32 following Fas stimulation requires endogenous aspartate-directed, cysteine protease activity, most likely of the CED-3/ICE family. Further, we show that in cells expressing Bcl-2, Fas-induced CPP32 activation is inhibited. These results demonstrate that Bcl-2 functions at or upsteam of the CPP32 activation step in a cell death pathway. Jurkat cells (clone E6-1, ATCC, Rockville, MD) were cultured in medium RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). Jurkat cells were stably transfected with the plasmid SFFV-human bcl-2 or the control plasmid SFFV-neo (31Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Screiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3509) Google Scholar). Selection of the SFFV-Bcl-2 transfectants in G418 yielded a Bcl-2-transfected pool that, on limiting dilution, yielded several clonal Bcl-2 cell lines (representative clone 18 was used for further analysis). FACS and Western analysis of the Bcl-2 transfectants with the Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody, 6C8, demonstrated Bcl-2 levels 10-20-fold enhanced over the levels of Bcl-2 present in untransfected or SFFV-neo-transfected Jurkat cells. For cell death assays, 100,000 cells were placed in a 0.28-cm2 tissue culture well and exposed to 100 ng/ml CH11 Fas monoclonal antibody (PanVera Labs, Madison, WI) in the absence or presence of benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (ZVAD-FMK) or benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone (ZFA-FMK). At the indicated times, cells were treated with 1 mg/ml MTT for 90 min and the absorbance of the dissolved reaction reaction product measured at 650 nm. Control experiments demonstrated that the decline in MTT metabolism correlated closely with the appearance of apoptotic cells in the culture as assessed by the nuclear condensation and fragmentation observed using either phase contrast microscopy or immunofluorescence of nuclei labeled with Hoechst dye no. 33342 (data not shown). FACS analysis demonstrated that both the ZVAD-FMK-treated and the Bcl-2-transfected Jurkat cells expressed normal levels of cell surface Fas (data not shown). Cytosolic extracts were prepared essentially as described (36Yang T. Kozopas K. Craig R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled, in vitro translated PARP was generated using the TNT-linked transcription/translation kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, human PARP cDNA (a gift from A. Bürkle) in pBluescript SK (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) was linearized with SmaI prior to use. Linearized template was incubated with T3 polymerase, 40 µCi of [35S]methionine, and TNT kit components to generate in vitro translated PARP. In vitro translated PARP (2% of total TNT reaction) was incubated with 5 µg of cytosolic extracts for 1 h. at 30°C in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mM dithiothreitol (Buffer A). Reactions were boiled in Laemmli buffer, separated on 4-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the protein bands visualized by autoradiography. ZVAD-FMK was synthesized as described (37Revesz L. Briswalter C. Heng R. Leutwiler A. Mueller R. Waethrich H.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 9693-9696Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). ZFA-FMK was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin was purchased from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin was prepared by coupling Ac-Asp(OBut)-OH to H-Glu(OBut)Val-Asp(OBut)-AMC followed by deprotection with 50% trifluoroacetic acid in CH2Cl2. The requisite amine was prepared by coupling Z-Glu(OBut)Val-OH to H-Asp(OBut)-AMC followed by catalytic hydrogenation over palladium on carbon. Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-H was prepared by coupling Ac-Asp(OBut)-OH to H-Glu(OBut)Val Asp(OBut)-semicarbazone followed by sequential deprotection with 50% trifluoroacetic acid in CH2Cl2 and 37% aq HCHO/AcOH/MeOH (1:1:3). The requisite amine was prepared by coupling Z-Glu(OBut)Val-OH to H-Asp(OBut)-semicarbazone (38Graybill T.L. Dolle R.E. Helaszek C.T. Miller R.E. Ator M.E. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1994; 44: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) followed by catalytic hydrogenation over palladium on carbon. All couplings were performed using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-1-hydroxybenztriazol in either CH2Cl2 or CH2Cl2-dimethylformamide. Recombinant human CPP32 and mouse ICE proteases were expressed in bacteria by transformation of E. Coli BL21 with plasmids pET 21b (CPP32) or pET3a (ICE) (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing a BamHI/XhoI or a NdeI/BamHI fragment of the human CPP32 (5Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or mouse ICE cDNAs, respectively. After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, bacteria were harvested and lysates prepared by sonication in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g. CPP32 was purified from bacterial lysates by Ni2+ chromatography (Hi-Trap; Pharmacia Biotech) and elution with a 60 mM to 1 M gradient of imidazole following manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Madison, WI). Enzyme reactions contained 20 µM acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) or acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (YVAD-AMC) in Buffer A and either 5 µg of Jurkat cell cytosolic extracts or 0.3 nM recombinant CPP32 (rCPP32) with or without the reversible inhibitor acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD-aldehyde). Fluorescent AMC product formation was measured at excitation 360 nm, emission 460 nm using a Cytofluor II fluorescent plate reader (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The inhibitory effects of ZVAD-FMK inhibitor on several cysteine proteases were examined: YVAD-AMC hydrolysis by mICE lysate, DEVD-AMC hydrolysis by CPP32, benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg-AMC (Sigma) hydrolysis by cathepsin B (Sigma), and succinyl-Leu-Tyr-AMC (Sigma) by calpain I (Calbiochem). All reactions were performed in buffer A except cathepsin B reactions which were performed in 50 mM MES, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, pH 6.0. Calpain I reactions contained 10 mM CaCl2. The rate of inactivation of the enzymes by the ZVAD-FMK inhibitor was determined from the time-dependent inhibition of hydrolysis observed after the addition of excess inhibitor to enzyme reactions (39Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Zhao J.J. Howard A.D. Griffin P.R. Chapman K.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). 50 µl of 0.1-250 µM inhibitor was added to 200-µl reactions containing 12.5 µM substrate and 2 units of enzyme (1 unit of enzyme will liberate 1 µM AMC product in 60 min). The observed rate constant for the inactivation, kobs, was calculated from the progress curves of the hydrolysis reaction during the first 10% of the reaction using Equation 1, where Vo is the initial hydrolysis rate (40Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar), [AMC]=Vo(1−exp(−kobst))/kobs(Eq. 1) The second order rate constant for inactivation, kinact, is related to kobs by Equation 2 (39Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Zhao J.J. Howard A.D. Griffin P.R. Chapman K.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). kinact=(kobs/[I])(1+[S]/km)(Eq. 2) For anti-CPP32 immunoblots, cytosolic extracts from Fas antibody-stimulated cells (15 µg/lane) or purified recombinant CPP32 were separated on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with mouse monoclonal anti-CPP32 (Signal Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY) followed by goat anti-mouse coupled to alkaline phosphatase, or by affinity-purified anti-CPP32 p12 N-terminal peptide antibodies followed by goat anti-rabbit coupled to alkaline phosphatase. Rabbits were immunized with the peptide CSGVDDDMACHKIPVE corresponding to the N-terminal 15 amino acids of CPP32 p12 coupled via cysteine residues to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Serum antibodies were affinity-purified on peptide coupled to agarose beads. Affinity-purified p12 antibodies were tested by Western blot on bacterial extracts containing recombinant human CPP32 and were found to be specific for the p12 subunit of CPP32 (data not shown). Further control experiments demonstrated that preabsorption of the p12 antibodies with the peptide used for immunization eliminated the Western blot immunoreactivity (data not shown). For PARP immunoblots, whole cell lysates from Jurkat cells (25 µg of protein/lane) were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with monoclonal mouse anti-human PARP (41Ranjit G.B. Cheng M.-F. Mackay W. Whitacre C.M. Berger J.S. Berger N.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 223-234PubMed Google Scholar) followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase. Products were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). Treatment of Jurkat T cells with 100 ng/ml Fas monoclonal antibody CH11 induced death in >85% of the cells within 8 h, as measured by a metabolic assay (Fig. 1a). In order to determine if Bcl-2 inhibits Fas-induced Jurkat cell death, a similar experiment was performed using Bcl-2-transfected cells. Heterologous stable expression of Bcl-2 in a transfected pool as well as in clonal transfectants strongly inhibited Fas-induced Jurkat cell death (Fig. 1a). Previous studies have indicated that Fas-induced cell death involves members of the CED-3/ICE family of proteases (13Tewari M. Quan L.G. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G.

To further characterize the role of this protease family in Fas-induced killing of Jurkat cells, we utilized the protease inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (ZVAD-FMK). Peptidyl-fluoromethylketones are irreversible inhibitors of cysteine proteases (42Demuth H.U. J. Enzyme Inhibition. 1990; 3: 249-278Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 43Esser R.E. Angelo R.A.

Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and ZVAD-FMK contains an Asp in the P1 position, which has been shown to be critical for ICE inhibition (3Thornberry N.A. Bull H.D. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Ellison K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P.

Nature. 1992; 396: 768-774Crossref Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). ZVAD-FMK has recently been shown to specifically inhibit apoptosis in a tissue culture model, whereas a peptidyl-fluoromethylketone inhibitor of cathepsin B that lacks the P1 Asp was inert (44Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810.45Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To further characterize the specificity of ZVAD-FMK, we measured the second order rate constants (kinact) for inhibition of four cysteine proteases including two members of the ICE family (mouse ICE, human CPP32) as well as two non-members (cathepsin B and calpain 1). ZVAD-FMK inhibited both ICE-related proteases, with ICE showing the faster rate of inactivation (Table I). Compared to ICE, the rates of inactivation of cathepsin B and calpain 1 were 3-4 orders of magnitude slower. Compared to CPP32, which was inhibited more slowly than ICE, the rates for calpain 1 and cathepsin B were 440-fold and 75-fold slower, respectively. The selectivity of ZVAD-FMK for ICE-related proteases is further indicated by its lack of detectable inhibition of granzyme B, a mammalian serine protease with specificity for Asp in the P1 position. 2G. Salvesen and T. Komiyama, personal communication. Based on these specificity data, we utilized ZVAD-FMK as a pharmacological tool to assess the role of ICE-family proteases in Jurkat cell death.Table ISecond order rate constants (kinact) for inhibition of cysteine proteases by ZVAD-FMKProteasekinactM−1 s−1Mouse ICE150,000#±#20,000Human CPP326,600#±#800Cathepsin B87#±#4Calpain 115#±#1 Open table in a new tab ZVAD-FMK showed a dose-dependent inhibition of Fas-induced Jurkat death, with maximal protection observed at concentrations above 10 µM (data not shown). Quantitatively similar results were obtained with either the free acid or methyl ester of ZVAD-FMK. The anti-apoptotic effects of 50 µM ZVAD-FMK on the time course of cell death is shown in Fig. 1a. As a control, we tested the ability of an irreversible cathepsin B inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone (ZFA-FMK) to block Fas-induced Jurkat cell death. ZFA-FMK inhibits cathepsin B with a second order rate constant 2 orders of magnitude higher than ZVAD-FMK (45Rasnick D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and Table I). ZFA-FMK showed no detectable inhibition of cell death at any of the concentrations tested (0.1-200 µM; data not shown). Thus the effect of ZVAD-FMK on cell death is due neither to a nonspecific action of the fluoromethylketone moiety, nor likely to inhibition of cathepsin B. To assess whether the CPP32 protease is activated following Fas ligation, we first examined the proteolytic cleavage of the endogenous nuclear protein PARP. Recent evidence suggests that PARP is cleaved by CPP32 or a related enzyme in response to a number of cell death stimuli (9Fernandes-Alnemri T. Takahashi A. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Fritz L.

Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts of Jurkat cells demonstrated cleavage of the 115-kDa PARP protein into the characteristic 85-kDa fragment at 1 h after Fas stimulation and complete cleavage by 4 h (Fig. 1b). Coincubation of Fas-stimulated Jurkat cells with ZVAD-FMK completely prevented PARP cleavage (Fig. 1b), confirming that PARP cleavage does require aspartate-directed cysteine protease activity. Bcl-2 overexpression also strongly suppressed PARP cleavage (Fig. 1b), placing Bcl-2 action upstream of this nuclear event. To further investigate Fas-i"
https://openalex.org/W2007172615,"Past experiments and current paradigms of cholesterol homeostasis suggest that cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase plays a crucial role in sterol metabolism by controlling the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids. Consistent with this conclusion, we show in the accompanying paper that mice deficient in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7−/− mice) exhibit a complex phenotype consisting of abnormal lipid excretion, skin pathologies, and behavioral irregularities (Ishibashi, S., Schwarz, M., Frykman, P. K., Herz, J., and Russell, D. W. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 18017-18023). Aspects of lipid metabolism in the Cyp7−/− mice are characterized here to deduce the physiological basis of this phenotype. Serum lipid, cholesterol, and lipoprotein contents are indistinguishable between wild-type and Cyp7−/− mice. Vitamin D3 and E levels are low to undetectable in knockout animals. Stool fat content is significantly elevated in newborn Cyp7−/− mice and gradually declines to wild-type levels at 28 days of age. Several species of 7α-hydroxylated bile acids are detected in the bile and stool of adult Cyp7−/− animals. A hepatic oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity that may account for the 7α-hydroxylated bile acids is induced between days 21 and 30 in both wild-type and deficient mice. An anomalous oily coat in the Cyp7−/− animals is due to the presence of excess monoglyceride esters in the fur. These data show that 7α-hydroxylase and the pathway of bile acid synthesis initiated by this enzyme are essential for proper absorption of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins in newborn mice, but not for the maintenance of serum cholesterol and lipid levels. In older animals, an alternate pathway of bile acid synthesis involving an inducible oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase plays a crucial role in lipid and bile acid metabolism.

In older animals, an alternate pathway of bile acid synthesis involving an inducible oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase plays a crucial role in lipid and bile acid metabolism. Two pathways of bile acid biosynthesis have been described in the mammalian liver. One pathway is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocyte by the enzyme cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (referred to hereafter as 7α-hydroxylase; cholesterol 7α-monooxygenase (EC)), which converts cholesterol (cholest-5-en-3β-ol) into 7α-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3β,7α-diol). Subsequent enzymatic steps lead to the formation of the primary bile acids cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (reviewed in 1Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Google Scholar). A second pathway is initiated in the mitochondria by the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase, which converts cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3β,27-diol) (2Axelson M. Sjövall J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 631-640Google Scholar). This intermediate is acted on by an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase to form 7α,27-dihydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,27-triol) (3Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Google Scholar, 4Toll A. Wikvall K. Sudjana-Sugiaman E. Kondo K. Björkhem I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 309-316Google Scholar, 5Axelson M. Shoda J. Sjövall J. Toll A.

The pathway initiated by 7α-hydroxylase is thought to be the major route by which bile acids are synthesized in the liver. This assumption arises in part because the 7α-hydroxylase pathway was discovered first (8Danielsson H. Einarsson K. Johansson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 2: 44-49Google Scholar) and because the level of 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity is tightly controlled by feedback regulation (1Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Google Scholar). The importance of this pathway is underscored by the finding that expression of an exogenous 7α-hydroxylase gene in hamsters via infection with a recombinant adenovirus leads to a marked increase in bile acid formation (9Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M.N. Meidell R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 700-709Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the role of 7α-hydroxylase in bile acid metabolism, a line of mice deficient in this enzyme was created by gene targeting methods (10Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P.K. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 18017-18023Google Scholar). Young 7α-hydroxylase-deficient mice (Cyp7−/−) exhibit a complex phenotype consisting of an increased rate of postnatal death, fat malabsorption, wasting, skin abnormalities, and vision problems (10Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P.K. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 18017-18023Google Scholar). The absence of bile acids in newborn animals combined with fat-soluble vitamin deficiency is considered the most likely explanation for this phenotype. A peculiar feature of murine 7α-hydroxylase deficiency is that the phenotype is only present in newborn mice: once a deficient animal reaches the age of ∼3 weeks, symptoms wane to the point that adult animals are indistinguishable from wild-type mice (10Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P.K. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 18017-18023Google Scholar). We now explain this phenotype by showing that the mitochondrial bile acid pathway is not present at birth, but appears at day 21 in both wild-type and Cyp7−/− mice, thereby obviating the requirement for 7α-hydroxylase. Induction correlates with the appearance of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in the liver and results in the formation of bile with an altered composition of bile acids relative to animals in which both pathways are functioning. By studying the levels of vitamins D3 and E, we have formulated the hypothesis that the bile acid products of the mitochondrial pathway are not as efficient as those of the endoplasmic reticulum pathway in mediating vitamin E absorption. Thus, the requirement for two pathways may reflect a need to synthesize bile acids of diverse chemical structures in order to ensure maximum solubilization of different dietary fats and vitamins. Bile was drawn from the gallbladders of mice euthanized with sodium pentobarbital. Samples were stored frozen at −20°C until analyzed. Blood for lipoprotein, cholesterol, and triglyceride analysis was drawn by cardiac puncture or exsanguination via the ascending carotid artery and clotted at room temperature for 30 min. The sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 50 min, and the serum was decanted from the pelleted blood cells. The levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein were determined as described previously (11Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Google Scholar). Vitamin E levels were measured in epididymal or ovarian fat samples using high pressure liquid chromatography methods as described previously (12Traber M.G. Kayden H.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1987; 46: 488-495Google Scholar). Vitamin D metabolites were assayed as described previously (13Popoff S.N. Osier L.K. Zerwekh J.E. Marks S.C. Bone (Elmsford). 1994; 15: 515-522Google Scholar, 14Sakhaee K. Baker S. Zerwekh J.E. Poindexter J. Garcia-Hernandez P.A. Pak C.Y.C. J. Urol. (Paris). 1994; 152: 324-327Google Scholar), except that bovine mammary gland vitamin D receptor was used in place of calf thymus gland vitamin D receptor. In brief, serum samples were supplemented with trace quantities of radioactive 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to quantify the yield of this metabolite during the ensuing purification. Following extraction of vitamin D metabolites from serum with acetonitrile and back-extraction with phosphate buffer, the vitamin D metabolites were purified and separated via chromatography on C18 and silica Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters). After removing an aliquot of the purified fractions for determination of yield, assay of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was performed via competitive protein binding using a 1:5000 dilution of human serum (vitamin D-binding protein) as the binding agent. The sensitivity of this assay is 0.2 ng or a serum value of 1 ng/ml assuming 80% yield and a single determination. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation are 5 and 8%, respectively. Because this purification scheme does not separate the D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol) forms of the metabolites, the concentration measured in serum represents total vitamin D. The extraction, separation, derivatization, and analyses of bile acids in bile using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry were carried out as described previously (15Setchell K.D.R. Yamashita H. Rodrigues C.M.P. O'Connell N.C. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4169-4178Google Scholar). Oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity was determined in 0.5-ml incubation mixtures containing 0.06 nmol of 25-[26,27-3H2]hydroxycholesterol (77 Ci/mmol), 250 µg of microsomal protein, 0.75 µmol of NADPH, 50 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.03% (v/v) Triton X-100. After incubation for 15 min at 37°C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 6 ml of methylene chloride. The organic phase was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen; the lipid pellet was dissolved in 40 µl of acetone and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel LK5D 150-Å plates (Whatman) in a solvent system containing toluene/ethyl acetate (2:3). 1The compositions of all solvent systems are indicated as volumetric ratios. A sample of authentic cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,25-triol was synthesized using a modification of a method described previously (16Schenck G.O. Golinick K. Neumüller O.A. Ann. Chem. (Justus Liebigs). 1957; 603: 46-59Google Scholar, 17Schenck G.O. Neumüller O.A. Eisfeld W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1958; 19: 595Google Scholar). Briefly, cholest-5-ene-3β,25-diol was photochemically converted into 5α-hydroperoxycholest-6-ene-3β,25-diol in the presence of oxygen and hematoporphyrin. The product was purified by silica gel chromatography with a 46% yield and incubated in chloroform to allow rearrangement to the 7α-hydroperoxide derivative. This material was reduced with sodium borohydride to yield the desired product, which was purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography in a toluene/ethyl acetate (2:3) solvent system. The final yield of cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,25-triol was 3-5%. Scissors were used to barber fur from the abdomens or backs of mice. A 10-mg aliquot of fur was extracted with 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) for 2 h at 4°C with continuous agitation. The resulting solvent was transferred to a fresh polypropylene tube and evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream. The pellet was dissolved in 50 µl of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel LK5D 150-Å plates in a solvent system containing toluene/ethyl acetate (7:3). For stool lipid analysis, 100-mg aliquots of droppings collected from animals of the indicated ages were mixed with a small amount of [carboxyl-14C]triolein (112 mCi/mmol) and dried for 1 h in a vacuum oven at 70°C. The solid matter was extracted with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) for 30 min at 60°C, passed through a Whatman No. 1 filter, and brought to a final volume of 4 ml with chloroform/methanol (2:1). The material was back-extracted with 1 ml of H2O, and the organic phase was evaporated to dryness. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and transferred to preweighed vials. The solvent was evaporated, and the vial was taken to a constant weight by drying in a vacuum oven at 70°C. The difference in weight between the starting empty vial and the vial containing the dried lipid was the fecal lipid amount, which was expressed as a percentage of the weight of the starting fecal sample. The percent recovery of radiolabeled triolein (85-92%) was determined by subjecting the vial to scintillation counting. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of mouse fur lipids was performed before and after saponification as described previously (18Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Google Scholar). Native lipids were converted into trimethylsilyl ethers prior to analysis (19Lund E. Boberg K.M. Byström S. Ölund J. Carlström K. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4929-4937Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were treated with pyridine/hexamethyldisilazane/chlorotrimethylsilane (3:2:1) at 60°C for 30 min. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the residue was dissolved in hexane for gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry analyses. Saponified samples were converted into methyl esters by treatment with diazomethane (19Lund E. Boberg K.M. Byström S. Ölund J. Carlström K. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4929-4937Google Scholar), further derivatized with trimethylsilane as described above, and then subjected to chemical analysis. The normal diet was mouse/rat diet 7001 (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) and contained ≥4% (w/w) fat, ≥24% (w/w) protein, and ≤5% (w/w) fiber. Where indicated, this diet was supplemented with 1% (w/w) cholic acid (Sigma). Vitamin supplements (CritterVites, Mardel Labs, Glendale Heights, IL) containing both water-soluble vitamins (thiamine, 180 mg/kg; riboflavin, 300 mg/kg; pantothenic acid, 600 mg/kg; niacin, 1500 mg/kg; vitamin B12, 1500 µg/kg; vitamin B6, 150 mg/kg; folic acid, 100 mg/kg; and ascorbic acid, 9000 mg/kg) and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, 300,000 IU/kg; vitamin D3, 50,000 IU/kg; vitamin E, 750 IU/kg; and menadione, 250 mg/kg) were added to water bottles at the concentration (1 g/liter) recommended by the manufacturer. Vitamin supplements were replaced on a daily basis. To determine the effects of 7α-hydroxylase deficiency on serum lipid levels, blood was sampled from animals of different genotypes and ages, and the serum lipids were analyzed. The data of Table I show that although there is wide interanimal variation, serum triglyceride and cholesterol contents are similar in wild-type and deficient mice, regardless of the age of the animals. In agreement with these measurements, the profiles of lipoprotein particles in the serum were similar in individual animals of different Cyp7 genotypes (Fig. 1). In experiments not shown, the concentrations of cholesterol in several tissues (liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and heart) were not significantly different between 15-day-old wild-type and mutant mice.Table I.Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in wild-type and Cyp7−/− miceAgeCyp7 genotypeCholesterolaValues represent means±S.D. derived from measurements made in the sera of 4-10 animals of the indicated age and genotype.TriglycerideaValues represent means±S.D. derived from measurements made in the sera of 4-10 animals of the indicated age and genotype.daysmg/dlmg/dl6+/+102.2 ±16.5177.6 ±104.7−/−85.6 ±22.3140.0 ±42.215+/+170.9 ±30.793.0 ±42.8−/−157.5 ±44.3151.7 ±63.323+/+88.4 ±10.054.2 ±10.7−/−99.7 ±19.682.3 ±28.060-90+/+91.5 ±7.964.4 ±7.9−/−91.7 ±5.639.7 ±7.7150-180+/+107.1 ±15.776.3 ±19.1−/−122.5 ±20.082.5 ±27.2a Values represent means±S.D. derived from measurements made in the sera of 4-10 animals of the indicated age and genotype. Open table in a new tab Many of the phenotypic characteristics of 7α-hydroxylase-deficient mice, including early death, skin abnormalities, and eye and vision problems, are reminiscent of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that these symptoms can be alleviated by supplementing the water supply of nursing mothers with a vitamin mixture (10Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P.K. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 18017-18023Google Scholar). To determine if a fat-soluble vitamin deficiency could be directly demonstrated, the levels of vitamins D3 and E were measured in the serum and fat, respectively, of mutant and wild-type mice. The data of Table II show that Cyp7−/− mice contain low levels of vitamins D3 and E. These deficiencies are detected in mice of different ages and in nursing mothers. Vitamin supplementation alone partially restored levels of vitamins D3 and E, whereas dietary supplementation with vitamins and a bile acid (cholic acid) more fully restored vitamin levels (Table II).Table II.Serum vitamin D3 and tissue vitamin E levels in wild-type and Cyp7−/− miceAgeaSerum or fat tissue was pooled from 3-12 male and female mice to derive the values shown for the 6-,16-,and 23-day time points.,bValues for 34-38 and 120-180-day mice represent means±S.E. derived from three to five animals.Cyp7 genotypeSerum vitamin D3c25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were measured in serum as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Tissue vitamin EdVitamin E levels were measured in epididymal or ovarian fat pads as described under “Experimental Procedures.”ChowChow+vitaminsChow+vitamins, cholic acidChowChow+vitaminsChow+vitamins, cholic aciddaysng/mlng/mg triglyceride6+/+20.0—e—, not done.————−/−2.05.012.0———16+/+18.0——11.6——−/−3.74.09.00.3<0.112.023+/+8.0——24.4——−/−1.04.09.0<0.1<0.153.334-38+/+17.7 ±1.1——10.4 ±2.0——−/−15.7 ±2.4——5.6 ±3.6——120-180+/+17.5 ±2.5——90.7 ±25.4——−/−20.0 ±3.311.0±4.428.5±2.54.4 ±4.411.6±2.5146.1±91.8a Serum or fat tissue was pooled from 3-12 male and female mice to derive the values shown for the 6-,16-,and 23-day time points.b Values for 34-38 and 120-180-day mice represent means±S.E. derived from three to five animals.c 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were measured in serum as described under “Experimental Procedures.”d Vitamin E levels were measured in epididymal or ovarian fat pads as described under “Experimental Procedures.”e —, not done. Open table in a new tab A second characteristic feature of newborn 7α-hydroxylase-deficient mice is their excretion of clay-colored stools, which are reminiscent of fat malabsorption (steatorrhea). To confirm this diagnosis, the stool fat content was monitored as a function of age in Cyp7−/− mice. The data of Fig. 2 show that newborn mice have enormously elevated levels of fat in their stools and that this elevation persists through approximately postnatal day 22, at which time the stool fat content begins to decrease and eventually (by day 28) approximates that of wild-type animals. Weaning took place on day 30 in these experiments; thus, the decline in fat content occurred while the animals were maintained on a high fat diet (mother's milk). The reduction in stool fat content on or about postnatal day 22 coincides with the time at which the survival rate of mutant mice is dramatically increased (10Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P.K. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 18017-18023Google Scholar). Those few animals that reach this age thereafter experience a normal life span. These findings are suggestive of a major change in bile acid metabolism occurring around postnatal day 22 in the Cyp7−/− mice. The chemical composition of bile from adult wild-type and Cyp7−/− animals (∼3 months of age) was examined next. Animals were maintained on normal unsupplemented chow for ≥4 weeks; the major bile duct was cannulated; and bile was collected over a period of 30-60 min from two mice of each genotype. The withdrawn samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify individual bile acids. The results of these analyses are shown in Table III. The concentration of bile acids in the bile of wild-type and mutant mice was similar and ranged from 9.9 to 14.6 mM. Bile from wild-type animals contained at least 11 separable and measurable bile acid derivatives, of which cholic acid and β-muricholic acid were the predominant species, accounting together for ∼75% of the total bile acids. In the Cyp7−/− mice, the concentration of cholic acid, but not β-muricholic acid, was decreased by more than half relative to that found in the wild-type animals (Table III). In addition, several bile acids were increased in concentration relative to levels in wild-type animals. For example, hyodeoxycholic acid (3α,6α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid) was not detected in wild-type bile, but this compound represented 14-25% of the total bile acid in the Cyp7−/− animals. Similarly, chenodeoxycholic acid and α-muricholic acid were detected only in the mutant mice (Table III).Table III.Analysis of bile acids in bile of individual wild-type and Cyp7−/− adult miceRetention timeaBile acids are listed based on retention times as methyl ester-trimethylsilyl ethers relative to a homologous series of n-alkanes, referred to as the methylene unit (MU) value.Bile acidbChemical structures were established by electron ionization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Cyp7 genotype+/++/+−/−−/−MUµmol/liter31.813,12-Dihydroxy bile acid31242510718932.003α,7α,12α-Trihydroxy-5α-cholanoic acid (allo-cholic acid)48265117423632.133α,7α-Dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (chenodeoxycholic acid)NDcND, not detected.ND43135032.183α,6β,7α-Trihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (α-muricholic acid)NDND76667232.233α,7α,12α-Trihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (cholic acid)671076091918243432.293α,6α-Dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (hyodeoxycholic acid)NDND2486171332.513α,7β-Dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (ursodeoxycholic acid)15030416816232.843α,7α,12α-Trihydroxy-5β-homocholanoic acid (homocholic acid)155178NDND33.0712-Oxo-3α-hydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid15721789974633.213α,6β,7β-Trihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (β-muricholic acid)177831311717306033.523α,7β,12α-Trihydroxy-5α-cholanoic acid13223717114633.72Oxodihydroxy bile acid27638016313933.807-Oxo-3α,12α-Dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid260290ND34034.293α,6α,7β-Trihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (ω-muricholic acid)55512039021714Total bile acids10,96714,625990211,901a Bile acids are listed based on retention times as methyl ester-trimethylsilyl ethers relative to a homologous series of n-alkanes, referred to as the methylene unit (MU) value.b Chemical structures were established by electron ionization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.c ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab The data of Table IV summarize the results obtained after chemical analyses of bile acids in stool samples of adult normal and Cyp7−/− animals (∼4 months of age). Feces were collected for a period of several days from five individual animals of each genotype, weighed, and then extracted and analyzed for bile acids. The average weight of stool collected from the wild-type mice was 1.32 ± 0.12 g/day (mean ± S.E.) versus 1.35 ± 0.05 g/day for the Cyp7−/− mice. The concentration of total bile acids in the droppings of wild-type mice was 1095.8 ± 88.9 µg/g of feces, whereas the droppings from Cyp7−/− mice contained 369.8 ± 18.2 µg/g of feces (Table IV). The diminished bile acid concentration in the stool samples of the mutant animals reflected a uniform decline in almost all of the individual bile acid species detected in the analyses (Table IV). For example, deoxycholic acid, which is the most abundant bile acid in mouse stool, was reduced from 316.2 ± 28.6 µg/g in the wild-type animals to 47.4 ± 12.6 µg/g in the Cyp7−/− animals (Table IV).Table IV.Analysis of fecal bile acids in individual wild-type and Cyp7−/− adult miceRetention timeaBile acids are listed based on their retention times as methyl ester-trimethylsilyl ethers relative to a homologous series of n-alkanes, referred to as the methylene unit (MU) value.Bile acidbChemical structures were determined by electron ionization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Cyp7 genotype+/++/++/++/++/+−/−−/−−/−−/−−/−MUµg/g feces31.183α-Hydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (lithocholic acid)1223262231866ND431.61Unknown bile acidNDcND, not detected.12231818NDND4NDND31.763,12-Dihydroxy bile acid2127263432365ND431.883α-12α-Dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (deoxycholic acid)242276319411333417378103532.003α,7α,12α-Trihydroxy-5α-cholanoic acid (allo-cholic acid)181111ND9NDND68832.153α,7α-Dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (chenodeoxycholic acid)ND811ND108667432.203α,6β,7α-Trihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (α-muricholic acid)4536565769NDNDNDNDND32.263α,7α,12α-Trihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (cholic acid)12713715818113243627018811732.293α,6α-Dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (hyodeoxycholic acid)60106129112114696471595132.45Unknown bile acid132024202010787832.513α,7β-Dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (ursodeoxycholic acid)NDND11NDND6ND14NDND32.603β,12α-Dihydroxy-5α-cholanoic acid1216172120NDNDNDNDND32.843α,7α,12α-Trihydroxy-5β-homocholanoic acid (homocholic acid)8ND141510ND4NDNDND33.0612-Oxo-3α-hydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid6544857561263530232633.223α,6β,7β-Trihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (β-muricholic acid)76667714181455453717533.797-Oxo-3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid11ND9166ND566534.303α,6α,7β-Trihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (ω-muricholic acid)117140157194136393429293534.553α,6α,7β-Trihydroxy-5α-cholanoic acid (allo-ω-muricholic acid)273341433467466Total bile acids854955119413601116304363390414378a Bile acids are listed based on their retention times as methyl ester-trimethylsilyl ethers relative to a homologous series of n-alkanes, referred to as the methylene unit (MU) value.b Chemical structures were determined by electron ionization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.c ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Several conclusions were reached from the data summarized in Table III., Table IV.. First, Cyp7−/− animals that survive to adulthood when maintained on unsupplemented chow have normal concentrations of total bile acids in their bile (Table III), but reduced concentrations of bile acids in their stool (Table IV). Second, the composition of bile in terms of the individual bile acid species is different in the bile and stool of wild-type and Cyp7−/− animals. Third, adult animals deficient in 7α-hydroxylase nevertheless synthesize and secrete 7α-hydroxylated bile acids into their bile and excrete these compounds in their stool. Bile acids with a 7α-hydroxyl group could arise in the mutant mice as a consequence of 7α-hydroxylase activity present in the intestinal flora or from the activity of another endogenous sterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme. The data of Fig. 3 (lanes 1 and 3) demonstrate the presence of an enzyme activity in the livers of both wild-type and Cyp7−/− mice that is capable of 7α-hydroxylating cholest-5-ene-3β,25-diol (25-hydroxycholesterol) to form cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,25-triol. This oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme required NADPH as a cofactor (lanes 2 and 4). The specific activity of the enzyme was 6 pmol of product formed per min/mg of liver microsomal protein in adult wild-type mice and 5 pmol/min/mg of protein in Cyp7−/− mice. The experiment shown in Fig. 4 was performed to confirm that the product of this enzyme activity was cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,25-triol. An authentic standard representing the predicted product was chemically synthesized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This standard was chromatographed on a thin-layer plate either separately (lane 1) or together (lanes 2 and 3) with the radiolabeled products derived by incubating liver extracts with [3H]cholest-5-ene-3β,25-diol. A comparison of the position of the radiolabeled product on the chromatogram (determined by autoradiography) to that of the standard (determined by phosphomolybdic acid staining) revealed that the two sterols comigrated in this solvent system. Similar results were obtained when product analysis was carried out in two other solvent systems (chloroform/methanol/H2O/ethyl acetate (50:20:4:15) and toluene/ethyl acetate (2:3)) on silica gel plates and when the sample was analyzed by chromatography on C18 plates using an acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran (6:4) solvent system. Finally, analysis of the product by mass spectrometry confirmed the structure of the molecule as cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,25-triol (data not shown). We next determined the ability of different sterols to inhibit the oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity detected in the mutant mice. As shown by the data of Fig. 5, the product of the enzyme, cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,25-triol,"

Tyrosine phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase Syk and phospholipase Cγ2 are early events in collagen-induced activation. We recently proposed that collagen-signaling in platelets involves a receptor or a receptor-associated protein containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) enabling interaction with Syk. In this report we show that collagen stimulation of platelets causes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM containing Fc receptor γ-chain and that this is precipitated by the tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Syk expressed as a fusion protein. In addition we demonstrate an association between the Fc receptor γ-chain with endogenous Syk in collagen-stimulated platelets. The Fc receptor γ-chain undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets stimulated by a collagen-related peptide which does not bind the integrin α2β1 and by the lectin wheat germ agglutinin. In contrast, cross-linking of the platelet low affinity receptor for immune complexes, FcγRIIA, or stimulation by thrombin does not induce phosphorylation of the Fc receptor γ-chain. The present results provide a molecular basis for collagen activation of platelets which is independent of the integrin α2β1 and involves phosphorylation of the Fc receptor γ-chain, its association with Syk and subsequent phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ2. Collagen is the first example of a nonimmune receptor stimulus to signal through a pathway closely related to signaling by immune receptors.

Collagen is the first example of a nonimmune receptor stimulus to signal through a pathway closely related to signaling by immune receptors. The adhesive and stimulatory properties of the extracellular matrix protein collagen on platelets are vital for the maintenance of hemeostasis. Upon vascular damage, platelets adhere to subendothelial collagen which stimulates a tyrosine kinase dependent pathway leading to platelet degranulation, aggregation and development of a hemeostatic plug. The mechanism of collagen stimulation of platelets is poorly understood, and the distinction between adhesion and stimulation ill defined. Several platelet glycoproteins have been implicated as potential collagen receptors, including the integrin α2β1 (1Santoro S.A. Rajpara S.M. Staatz W.D. Woods Jr., V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Syk is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase which is assembled into signaling complexes via interaction between its tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a tyrosine phosphorylated activation motif found in receptors of the immune system or their associated chains. The motif, termed the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), has the amino acid sequence YXXL/IX6-8YXXL/I (13Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Google Scholar), and is phosphorylated on the conserved tyrosine residues by a member of the Src kinase family upon receptor activation. phospholipase Cγ2 Src homology region 2 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif collagen-related peptide wheat germ agglutinin monoclonal antibody glutathione S-transferase glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing tandem SH2 domains of Syk low affinity immunoglobulin G receptors Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 high affinity immunoglobulin G receptor high affinity immunoglobulin E receptor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We recently proposed (12Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G. Clark E.A. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar) that a collagen receptor or an associated protein may contain an ITAM motif to allow interaction with Syk. In this report we show that stimulation of platelets with collagen induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the Fc receptor γ-chain (FcR γ-chain), which contains an ITAM motif, and that this promotes an association between the FcR γ-chain and Syk. This allows the construction of a model linking collagen receptor ligation to activation of Syk and a tyrosine kinase signaling cascade. Anti-FcR γ-chain antiserum (14Letourneur O. Kennedy I.C. Brini A.T. Ortaldo J.R. O'Shea J.J. Kinet J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2652-2656Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. J.-P. Kinet (Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA), the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 6F1 was a gift from Dr. B. Coller (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY), and the rabbit polyclonal antibody to the T cell ζ-chain was kindly donated by Dr. D. Cantrell (ICRF, London). Collagen fibers, as Horm collagen, a suspension of type I fibers from equine tendon, were obtained from Nycomed (Munich, Germany). A collagen-related peptide (CRP: GCP*(GPP*)10GCP*G; single amino acid code P* = hydroxyproline) was synthesized and cross-linked as described previously (15Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology (TCS Biologicals Ltd., Botolph Claydon, Bucks, UK), anti-Syk antibodies: Syk(LR) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and mAb 101 from Wako GmbH (Neuss, Germany), and anti-FcγRII mAb IV.3 was purchased from Medarex Inc. (Annandale, NJ). Other reagents were from previously described sources (12Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G. Clark E.A. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar). Platelets were prepared as described previously (12Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G. Clark E.A. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar) and suspended in modified Tyrodes-Hepes buffer (134 mM NaCl, 0.34 mM Na2HPO4, 2.9 mM KCl, 12 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM Hepes, 5 mM glucose, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.3) containing 1 mM EGTA and 10 µM indomethacin to a density of 8 × 108 cells/ml. Mg2+ was omitted, and 1 mM EDTA was added to the buffer where stimulation in the absence of Mg2+ was required. Stimulation of platelets (675 µl) with collagen (100 µg/ml, 90 s), collagen-related peptide (CRP, 3 µg/ml, 90 s), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, 100 µg/ml, 60 s) was performed at 37°C in an aggregometer with continuous stirring at 800 rpm. Stimulation by cross-linking of the low affinity receptor for immunoglobulin G, FcγRIIA, was performed by preincubation of platelets for 60 s with monoclonal antibody IV.3 (1 µg/ml) followed by stimulation for 60 s by addition of anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 (30 µg/ml). Platelet stimulation was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of Laemmli sample-treatment buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10-18% gradient slab gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes which were then blocked by incubation in 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin dissolved in TBS-T (20 mM Tris, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in TBS-T containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and incubated with Western blots for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed for 2 h in TBS-T following each incubation with antibodies, and then developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system. Anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Syk immunoblots were performed using mAb 4G10 and mAb 101, respectively, at 1 µg/ml; anti-FcR γ-chain and anti-T cell ζ-chain immunoblots were made with rabbit antiserum diluted 1:10000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted 1:10000. Platelet stimulation was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 2% (v/v) Nonidet P40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.3). Detergent- insoluble debris was removed, and the lysates were precleared by mixing with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C (20 µl of a 50% (w/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose in TBS-T). Preclearing was omitted in samples stimulated by cross-linking of FcγRIIA, since this would result in removal of FcγRIIA from the lysate. FcR γ-chain was immunoprecipitated from 1.2 ml of lysate using 4 µl of rabbit antiserum, and Syk was immunoprecipitated from 100 µl of lysate using 4 µg of a polyclonal antibody Syk(LR). Following rotation at 4°C for 1 h, 25 µl of a 50% (w/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose was added to each sample, and mixing was continued for 1 h. The Sepharose pellet was washed in lysis buffer and then TBS-T, before addition of Laemmli sample-treatment buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10-18% gradient slab gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. A GST fusion protein containing the tandem SH2 domains of Syk (GST-Syk SH2) was constructed and expressed as described previously (12Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G. Clark E.A. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar) and bound to glutathione-agarose. Precipitation of platelet proteins with the fusion construct was performed as described previously (12Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G. Clark E.A. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10-18% gradient slab gels under either reducing or nonreducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The FcR γ-chain or Syk was immunoprecipitated as described above and assayed for kinase activity while immobilized on protein A-Sepharose following the final washing step. The supernatant was removed and replaced with assay buffer (105 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 µM ATP, and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Samples were incubated at 22°C for 10 min, whereupon reactions were stopped by addition of 500 µl of 50 mM EDTA at 4°C. Sepharose was pelleted by brief centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and Laemmli sample buffer was added to the pellets. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10-18% gradient slab gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Kinase activity was recorded by autoradiography. In a strategy designed to identify ITAM-containing proteins which undergo phosphorylation following collagen stimulation, platelet lysates were incubated with the tandem SH2 domains of Syk expressed as a GST fusion construct (GST-Syk SH2). Precipitation and immunoblotting for tyrosine phosphorylation revealed a reproducible association of two bands of 11 and 13 kDa along with several higher molecular mass bands. Candidates for the tyrosine-phosphorylated doublet which are known to contain an ITAM include the T cell receptor-associated ζ-chain and the FcR γ-chain. The ζ-chain was not detected in whole platelet lysates or in GST-Syk SH2 precipitates following immunoblotting with a specific antibody. Immunoblotting for the FcR γ-chain detected its presence in whole cell lysates and in GST-Syk SH2 precipitates from cells stimulated with collagen. Proteins precipitated by GST-Syk SH2 and separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions were immunoblotted using anti-FcR γ-chain antiserum (Fig. 1a(i)). Four proteins of 13, 11, 8.5, and 6.5 kDa were detected in samples precipitated from platelets stimulated with collagen, CRP, and WGA, but were not present in basal cells or cells stimulated by cross-linking FcγRIIA (Fig. 1a) or by thrombin (not shown). Reprobing with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that only the upper two bands were tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1a(ii)), indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain is associated with a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE. Two uncharacterized proteins of 65 and 70 kDa were also tyrosine-phosphorylated and precipitated from collagen-, CRP-, and WGA-stimulated platelets (Fig. 1a(ii)). Fig. 1a(ii) also demonstrates association of the tyrosine phosphorylated FcγRIIA with GST-Syk SH2 in cells stimulated by cross-linking of the receptor, as previously reported (12Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G. Clark E.A. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar), and also by WGA. The absence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins other than those mentioned above in WGA-stimulated platelets suggests that platelets do not express other ITAM-containing proteins which undergo tyrosine phosphorylation on cross-linking of cell surface glycosylated proteins. FcR γ-chain is expressed in cells as a homodimer linked by a disulfide bridge. Precipitation of non-tyrosine-phosphorylated FcR γ-chain with the SH2 domains of Syk may therefore be due to covalent association with a tyrosine-phosphorylated FcR γ-chain. To examine this, GST-Syk SH2 precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and immunoblotted for FcR γ-chain and for phosphotyrosine residues. Under nonreducing conditions, the FcR γ-chain protein remains dimerized and migrates a distance consistent with an approximate doubling of its molecular mass (Fig. 1b(i)). In accordance with this, there was an approximate doubling in molecular mass of the tyrosine phosphorylated bands under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1b(ii)). The SH2 domains of Syk precipitated similar amounts of the tyrosine-phosphorylated and non-tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of the FcR γ-chain, suggesting that only 1 molecule in each pair becomes phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of one chain in each dimer may prevent phosphorylation of the other chain or, alternatively, one chain may not be accessible to the kinase. The existence of four bands under reduced conditions may reflect the fact that the FcR γ-chain has additional tyrosine residues to those of the ITAM motif and can also undergo phosphorylation on threonine and serine residues (16Duchemin A.-M. Ernst L.K. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12111-12117Google Scholar, 17Paolini R. Jouvin M.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Google Scholar, 18Durdan D.L. Rosen H. Cooper J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 569-577Google Scholar). The appearance of non-tyrosine-phosphorylated FcR γ-chain as a doublet on SDS-PAGE has been observed in other cells (16Duchemin A.-M. Ernst L.K. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12111-12117Google Scholar). FcR γ-chain was immunoprecipitated from lysates of basal and stimulated cells and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation examined by immunoblot analysis. A time course of FcR γ-chain phosphorylation in response to collagen revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation occurred within 20 s and reached a maximum by 90 s (Fig. 2(i)). The FcR γ-chain, along with the tyrosine kinase Syk (12Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G. Clark E.A. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar), is one of the earliest proteins to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in collagen-stimulated platelets. While the above demonstrates that tyrosine-phosphorylated FcR γ-chain from collagen-activated platelets can bind to the SH2 domains of Syk, it is important to establish whether the FcR γ-chain associates with Syk in vivo. Immunoprecipitation of the FcR γ-chain combined with immunoblotting and in vitro kinase assays confirmed this interaction in collagen- and CRP-stimulated platelets. Minimal kinase activity was present in FcR γ-chain immunoprecipitates from resting cells, whereas marked phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain was observed in immunoprecipitates from collagen- and CRP-stimulated cells (Fig. 3a(i)). Phosphorylation of a protein which co-migrates with Syk was also observed, and the presence of Syk was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3a(ii)). Immunoblotting with mAb 4G10 revealed that Syk was already tyrosine-phosphorylated following co-immunoprecipitation with FcR γ-chain from collagen- and CRP-stimulated platelets (Fig. 3b(i)). Confirmation of the association between Syk and FcR γ-chain in collagen-stimulated cells was obtained through an in vitro kinase assay on Syk immunoprecipitates. Phosphorylation of a protein which co-migrates with the larger of the FcR γ-chain bands (13 kDa) was observed in stimulated cells (Fig. 3c). Equal amounts of the FcR γ-chain were immunoprecipitated in control and stimulated cells Fig. 3b(ii). This blot, however, shows only the lower molecular mass doublet of FcR γ-chain, although in longer exposures the upper doublet is visible (not shown). It appears that on collagen stimulation only a small proportion of the total cellular FcR γ-chain is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain and the resultant gel shift are most easily observed where the FcR γ-chain is concentrated by either immunoprecipitation or by GST-Syk SH2 precipitation. Although platelets adhere to collagen via the integrin α2β1 through a Mg2+-dependent mechanism (1Santoro S.A. Rajpara S.M. Staatz W.D. Woods Jr., V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 217-223Google Scholar), the role of this integrin in collagen signaling is uncertain. Significant phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain in collagen-stimulated platelets is observed in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 2(ii)), demonstrating independence from α2β1. Consistent with this, tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain by CRP, which does not bind to the α2β1 integrin (15Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Google Scholar), is also maintained in the absence of Mg2+. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain is also observed in response to both collagen and CRP in the presence of an α2β1 integrin blocking mAb 6F1 (Fig. 2(iii)). The different levels of basal FcR γ-chain phosphorylation in 2(ii) and 2(iii) are due to the use of different platelet preparations. The present study identifies a signaling protein which is involved in collagen-stimulated activation of platelets. The FcR γ-chain becomes tyrosine phosphorylated when platelets are stimulated with collagen enabling binding of Syk and the assembly of a signaling complex. Phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain is rapid and detectable within 20 s of stimulation and reaches maximal levels by 90 s. This time course is similar to that observed for the onset of tyrosine phosphorylation in collagen-stimulated platelets and suggests an early involvement of the FcR γ-chain in collagen signaling. The FcR γ-chain is recognized for its role in signaling by the high affinity receptors for IgE (FcεRI) (19Shiue L. Green J. Green O.M. Karas J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Ram M.K. Taylor M.K. Zoller M.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12111-12117Google Scholar, 22Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Google Scholar) and by the low affinity IgG receptor (FcγRIII) (22Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Google Scholar). Clustering and activation of FcεRI, FcγRI, and FcγRIII stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM on the FcR γ-chain enabling recruitment of Syk which becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated (16Duchemin A.-M. Ernst L.K. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12111-12117Google Scholar, 19Shiue L. Green J. Green O.M. Karas J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Ram M.K. Taylor M.K. Zoller M.J. Zydowsky L.D. Bolen J.B.

Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23318-23324Google Scholar). The promiscuous nature of the FcR γ-chain is further supported by the recent finding that it forms a functional association with the IgA receptor (FcαRI) in cells transfected to express both proteins (25Morton H.C. van den Herik-Oudijk I.E. Vossebeld P. Snijders A. Verhoeven A.J. Capel P.J.A. van de Winkel J.G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29781-29787Google Scholar). The FcR γ-chain is also vital for the assembly and surface expression of FcεRI and FcγRIII, by preventing inappropriate degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (26Takai T. Li M. Sylvestre D. Clynes R. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1994; 76: 519-529Google Scholar). The expression of FcεRI, FcγRI, FcγRIII, and the FcR γ-chain in platelets has not been reported. The kinase which is responsible for FcR γ-chain tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets requires identification. There is a precedent for the involvement of Src-like kinases in the phosphorylation of the ITAM (17Paolini R. Jouvin M.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Google Scholar, 27Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Google Scholar, 28Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Google Scholar, 29Jouvin M.H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Google Scholar). The kinase assays shown in Fig. 3, which were performed on FcR γ-chain and Syk immunoprecipitates, indicate that a kinase activity capable of phosphorylating the FcR γ-chain is co-immunoprecipitated from collagen- and CRP-stimulated cells. It is not known whether Syk or a co-precipitated Src-family kinase is the source of this activity. The identity of the collagen receptor which leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain is not known. Several lines of evidence suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain is not dependent on the integrin α2β1. Tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain is maintained in the absence of Mg2+ or presence of mAb 6F1, conditions which prevent the association of collagen with the integrin. In addition, CRP also stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain, yet is not capable of binding to the integrin (15Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Google Scholar). This suggests that collagen stimulation of platelets involves an uncharacterized receptor which is linked to the FcR γ-chain. Candidates for this receptor include those proteins described in the Introduction. Collagen is the only physiological platelet agonist that has been identified to induce phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain, suggesting that this event plays a unique role in collagen signaling. Platelets express a low affinity IgG receptor, FcγRIIA, which also contains an ITAM sequence, but its activation does not induce phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain. Clustering of the platelet Fcγ-IIA receptors results in tyrosine phosphorylation of its integral ITAM and tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2 (12Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G. Clark E.A. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Google Scholar, 30Chacko G. Duchemin A.-M. Coggeshall K. Osbourne J. Brandt J. Anderson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32435-32439Google Scholar). The lectin WGA, which is recognized as a powerful stimulus of platelet activation (31Ganguly C.L. Chelladurai M. Ganguly P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 313-319Google Scholar, 32Higashihara M. Takahata K. Ohashi T. Kariya T. Kume S. Oka H. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 433-438Google Scholar, 33Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Ohta S. Miyabo S.

Commun. 1993; 191: 453-458Google Scholar), elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk (35Ohta S. Taniguchi T. Asahi M. Kato Y. Nakagawara G. Yamamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1128-1132Google Scholar) and PLCγ2 (10Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Google Scholar), and also induces phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain and FcγRIIA. WGA therefore manifests its effects on platelets, at least in part, by activating components of both collagen and FcγRIIA pathways. Thrombin also stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk (36Taniguchi T. Kitagawa H. Yasue S. Yanagi S. Sakai K. Asahi M. Ohta S. Takeuchi F. Nakamura S. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2277-2279Google Scholar) but induces very weak or no phosphorylation of PLCγ2 (10Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Google Scholar) and does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain. This indicates that other pathways lead to phosphorylation of Syk in the platelet and it can be speculated that phosphorylation of an ITAM containing protein may be essential in leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2. A model for collagen stimulation of platelets can be proposed in light of the results of this study. Under the physiological condition of flow, platelets adhere to extracellular matrix collagen via the integrin α2β1. This brings collagen into association with a separate cell surface receptor which is coupled to the FcR γ-chain. Receptor clustering leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain, possibly by a Src-family kinase, enabling binding of Syk which becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and activated. This initiates a series of events which may involve other kinases and adaptor proteins leading to phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ2. A defect in collagen signaling may contribute to the hemorrhaging in utero which has recently been reported in mice engineered to lack the tyrosine kinase Syk (37Cheng A. Rowley B. Pao W. Hayday A. Bolen J. Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 378: 303-306Google Scholar, 38Turner M. Mee P. Costello P. Williams O. Price A. Duddy L. Furlong M. Geahlen R. Tybulewicz V.

https://openalex.org/W2020828897,"To define the structural determinants for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) binding of the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1), we developed a means of expressing the N-terminal 734 amino acids of IP3R1 (T734), which contain the IP3 binding region, in Escherichia coli. The T734 protein expressed in E. coli exhibited a similar binding specificity and affinity for IP3 as the native IP3R from mouse cerebellum. Deletion mutagenesis, in which T734 was serially deleted from the N terminus up to residue 215, markedly reduced IP3 binding activity. However, when deleted a little more toward the C terminus (to residues 220, 223, and 225), the binding activity was retrieved. Further N-terminal deletions over the first 228 amino acids completely abolished it again. C-terminal deletions up to residue 579 did not affect the binding activity, whereas those up to residue 568 completely abolished it. In addition, the expressed 356-amino acid polypeptide (residues 224-579) exhibited specific binding activity. Taken together, residues 226-578 were sufficient and close enough to the minimum region for the specific IP3 binding, and thus formed an IP3 binding “core.” Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on 41 basic Arg and Lys residues within the N-terminal 650 amino acids of T734. We showed that single amino acid substitutions for 10 residues, which were widely distributed within the binding core and conserved among all members of the IP3R family, significantly reduced the binding activity. Among them, three (Arg-265, Lys-508, and Arg-511) were critical for the specific binding, and Arg-568 was implicated in the binding specificity for various inositol phosphates.

Structural and functional studies on type I IP3R (IP3R1) (2749 amino acids, 313 kDa) have revealed that it is structurally divided into three parts: a large N-terminal cytoplasmic arm (83% of the receptor molecule); a putative six membrane-spanning domains clustered near the C terminus, which are thought to constitute an ion channel by forming a tetramer; and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (13Furuichi T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9184-9189Google Scholar).The binding of IP3 to this receptor purified from mouse cerebella is stoichiometric (Kd = ∼100 nM, Hill coefficient = ∼1.0) (2Supattapone S. Worley P.F.

To localize the IP3 binding site, deletion mutagenesis studies showed that IP3R1 binds IP3 within the N-terminal 650 amino acids independently of the tetramer formation (16Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Google Scholar, 17Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4911-4915Google Scholar). Newton et al. (18Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Google Scholar) have reported that the N-terminal 576 amino acids fused to glutathione S-transferase specifically bound IP3 with high affinity, whereas further N- or C-terminal deletions of this region completely abolished the specific binding. Furthermore, Mourey et al. (19Mourey R.J. Estevez V.A. Marecek J.F. Barrow R.K. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1719-1726Google Scholar) have reported that residues 471-501 in this region were labeled with a photoaffinity ligand. These results indicated that the IP3 binding site is localized within the N-terminal 576 amino acids and consists of some distantly separated motifs.IP3 is characterized by three negatively charged phosphate groups at equatorial positions 1, 4, and 5 of an inositol ring. Ca2+ release experiments using various synthetic inositol phosphate analogues showed that the IP3 recognition site is markedly stereospecific (20Nahorski S.R. Potter B.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 139-144Google Scholar, 21Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Google Scholar, 22Hirata M. Yanaga F. Koga T. Ogasawara T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8404-8407Google Scholar). The ability of IP3 to release Ca2+ depends critically upon the positional distribution of the phosphate groups around the inositol ring, suggesting that binding sites for these three phosphate groups make major contributions to the recognition and binding of (1,4,5)IP3. Thus, it has been assumed that there is a pocket of positive charges that facilitate ionic interactions with the negative charges on these three phosphate groups. This hypothetical model is supported by the following evidence. IP3 binding to the platelet membrane is blocked by the specific Arg-modifying reagent, p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal, suggesting the involvement of Arg in the IP3 binding (23O'Rourke F. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 297-302Google Scholar). IP3 binding to the receptor is competitively blocked by heparin (24Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Supattapone S. Wilson V.S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12132-12136Google Scholar), and the IP3R protein has been purified by heparin affinity column chromatography (2Supattapone S. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1530-1534Google Scholar, 15Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Google Scholar). The known binding site for heparin in antithrombin III is highly basic because of enriched Arg or Lys residues (25Smith J.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11964-11972Google Scholar). The IP3 binding to the receptor is augmented with increasing pH over the range 5-9 (24Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Supattapone S. Wilson V.S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12132-12136Google Scholar). A study using NMR spectroscopy showed that IP3 dissociates protons from three phosphate groups over this pH range, indicating that the negative charges of IP3 contribute its binding to the receptor (26White A.M. Varney M.A. Watson S.P. Rigby S. Liu C.S. Ward J.G. Reese C.B. Graham H.C. Williams R.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 759-764Google Scholar). Finally, x-ray crystallographic studies of the pleckstrin homology domain of β spectrin and phospholipase C-δ, which bind IP3 but have no sequence homology with IP3R, in complex with IP3 showed that 2 and 5 positively charged amino acid residues of this domain, respectively, interact with the phosphate groups of IP3 (27Hyvonen M. Macias M.J. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Google Scholar, 28Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Google Scholar).Despite the above evidence, the detailed molecular structure of the IP3 binding site of the IP3R remains to be studied. In this study, we developed an Escherichia coli expression system for various recombinant IP3 binding sites of mouse IP3R1. The N-terminal 734 amino acids of IP3R1 (T734) expressed in E. coli exhibited similar binding characteristics to those of the native cerebellar IP3R. Eighteen deletion mutageneses of T734 showed that 353 amino acids (residues 226-578) are directly responsible for the IP3 binding. Furthermore, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on 41 basic amino acid residues within the N-terminal 650 amino acids of T734 and showed that 10 single amino acid substitutions markedly reduced the IP3 binding activity. They were scattered within residues 226-578 and conserved among all members of the IP3R family. Of these, three were critical for IP3 binding and one was involved in binding specificity. We discuss the structure of the IP3 binding site of the IP3R.DISCUSSIONIt has been assumed that IP3R has a pocket with a highly restricted structure that specifically recognizes the IP3 molecule (20Nahorski S.R. Potter B.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 139-144Google Scholar). What is the minimum number of amino acids required to assure the binding conformation, and which residues are present on the surface of the pocket? To address these questions by molecular biological means, we developed an E. coli expression system in which the N-terminal 734-amino acid residues of mouse IP3R1 (T734) are expressed as soluble proteins. The binding affinity for (1,4,5)IP3 and specificity for various inositol phosphates of the expressed T734 proteins were similar to those of cerebellar IP3R, indicating that the binding sites expressed in this system form a functional conformation resembling the native binding site.Structure of the IP3 Binding Site (Residues 226-578)We found that, at most, 353 amino acid residues (residues 226-578) are sufficient for the IP3 binding with high affinity and specificity. Newton et al. (18Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Google Scholar) could delete the C terminus up to the residue 577. These results indicate that the critical region for the IP3 binding should be localized between the residues 226 and 576. This critical IP3 binding region of 351 amino acids shares 44% identity and 61% similarity with some interspersed diverse sequences in the corresponding region of other members of the IP3R family (Fig. 4). Within this region, only the alternative-splicing segment SI (15 amino acids, residues 318-332) is unlikely to be requisite for the binding, since the IP3R1 SI(−) splicing variant, which lacks this region, retains binding affinity similar to that of the IP3R1 SI(+) variant, which has this region (18Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Google Scholar). 2F. Yoshikawa and T. Furuichi, unpublished data. On the other hand, a deletion of either 3 more N-terminal or 9 more C-terminal amino acids from this 351-amino acid region completely abolished the binding activity. Mignery et al. (7Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Google Scholar, 16Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Google Scholar) and Miyawaki et al. (17Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4911-4915Google Scholar) have reported that any small deletions within this region cause a failure to bind IP3. Thus, residues 226-576 were sufficient and close to the minimum portion required for specific IP3 binding. Thus, we suggest that this portion forms the IP3 binding core.We mutated 41 basic amino acids (Arg and Lys) within the N-terminal 650-amino acid residues to the neutral amino acid, Gln, either singly or in pairs. Of these mutations, 10 single substitutions of Gln for Arg-241, Lys-249, Arg-265, Arg-269, Arg-504, Arg-506, Lys-508, Arg-511, Arg-568, and Lys-569 markedly reduced the IP3 binding activity. All 10 residues were identical among all IP3Rs, suggesting that they are functionally important. Three of them (Arg-265, Lys-508, and Arg-511) were critical, since the IP3 binding was completely abolished, even by substitution with a single amino acid. The reduction in IP3 binding activity caused by these site-directed substitutions is possibly due to a loss of the original side chain, which directly interacts with IP3, or to disruption of a local or global conformation for the binding. These 10 residues are scattered within the binding core, which is consistent with the results from the deletion studies, and can be classified into four segments (the first containing Arg-241 and Lys-249; the second, Arg-265 and Arg-269; the third, Arg-504, Arg-506, Lys-508, and Arg-511; and the fourth, Arg-568 and Lys-569). We suggest that on the tertiary structure of IP3R, these separated segments are positioned close to each other and form a positively charged pocket for binding to the negatively charged phosphate groups of IP3. The third segment is close to the residues 476-501, which were labeled by photoaffinity ligand, suggesting that it is in the proximity of the ligand binding site (19Mourey R.J. Estevez V.A. Marecek J.F. Barrow R.K. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1719-1726Google Scholar). Even functionally conservative mutations between Arg and Lys (K508R, R511K, and K569R) markedly reduced the IP3 binding activity like Gln or Ala substitutions, suggesting that the restricted basic amino acid residues in the higher order structure are requisite for the specific interaction with IP3. In comparison with the wild-type T734, the mutant R568Q exhibited lower affinity for (1,4,5)IP3 and a different binding specificity for various inositol phosphates, suggesting that Arg-568 is involved in not only high affinity binding with (1,4,5)IP3 but also determination of binding specificity. Therefore, Arg-568 may be involved in recognition of the functional group at the equatorial position-1 of the inositol ring, since R568Q recognizes (4,5)IP2 and (2,4,5)IP3 with higher affinity but (1,4,5)IP3 and (1,3,4,5)IP4 with lower affinity than the wild type.The Function of the N Terminus (Residues 1-225)This study indicated that the first 225 amino acids are not requisite for the specific IP3 binding, although there is significant sequence homology (64% identity and 76% similarity) in this region of the IP3R family. On the other hand, the deletion of only the first 31 amino acids resulted in a severe reduction in the binding activity. Such contradictory mutational effects were also found in serial N-terminal deletions up to residue 215. However, a deletion of 5 amino acids more toward the C terminus recovered the binding activity (D(1-220)). The binding activity was also recovered in the deletions as far as the residue 225 (D(1-223) and D(1-225)). These can be explained by two models. Serial deletions of the N terminus up to the residue 215 interfere with the higher order structure of the IP3 binding site formed by the residues 226-576, or the residues 216-220 act as a part of the inhibitory determinant when deletions up to residue 215 are performed. Therefore, we tested whether the synthetic peptide (CNTSWKIVLFMK) corresponding to the residues 214-225 inhibits the IP3 binding of the cerebellar IP3R, T734, or the mutant D(1-223). However, as far as we tested, this peptide had no significant inhibitory effect (data not shown) although we could not rule out the possibility that it does not inhibit the binding in an intermolecular manner.The binding affinity for IP3 of the core region (residues 224-579) was more than 10-fold higher than that of T734. This augmented affinity was probably due to deleting the N-terminal 223 amino acids from T734, since the mutant D(1-223) showed similar higher binding affinity (data not shown). Thus, we suggest that the N-terminal 225 amino acids are not directly responsible for, but may modulate, IP3 binding (for example, the binding affinity).Comparison of the N-terminal Portions between IP3R and the Ryanodine Receptor (RyR)RyR is another intracellular Ca2+ release channel originally identified in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle or cardiac muscle. IP3R has fragmentary sequence homology with RyR in the N-terminal portion, suggesting involvement of this region in common receptor-channel function(s) (6Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Google Scholar, 36Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Google Scholar). This seems to be supported by the fact that a single mutation of Arg-615 of the type 1 RyR (RyR1) to Cys causes porcine malignant hyperthermia (37MacLennan D.H. Phillips M.S. Science. 1992; 256: 789-794Google Scholar). The porcine malignant hyperthermia RyR1 channels are hypersensitive to various modulators, suggesting that the region around Arg-615 is a regulatory domain of channel opening, or that it is involved in binding an unknown channel activator. This region of RyR1 is fragmentarily homologous with the corresponding region (residues 621-659) of IP3R1 (Fig. 4). Besides this region, there are four homologous fragments within the N-terminal 580 amino acids of IP3R1 (residues 115-197, 227-252, 276-319, and 472-516) (6Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Google Scholar), of which three are within the IP3 binding region defined in this study. Among 10 important basic residues for the IP3 binding, three (Arg-241, Arg-504, and Arg-506) are conserved, but three critical residues (Arg-265, Lys-508, and Arg-511) are diverse in the RyR family (Fig. 4). Therefore, these homologous regions may be required for receptor-channel functions common in the intracellular Ca2+ release channel superfamily, such as sensing activation signal(s), modulation, or the transduction of activating signal(s) to channel opening.We defined the importance of basic amino acids for the binding of IP3R1 to IP3 molecule, which is similar to that reported for some pleckstrin homology domains that bind IP3 (27Hyvonen M. Macias M.J. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Google Scholar, 28Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Google Scholar). However, the overall constitution of the binding site seems to be different from these, which is reflected in the binding affinity and specificity. On the other hand, IP3R may recognize the hydroxy groups and the inositol ring of IP3 (20Nahorski S.R. Potter B.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 139-144Google Scholar, 38Hirata M. Watanabe Y.

Kohda K. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 294-303Google Scholar, 14Michikawa T. Hamanaka H. Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Tashiro Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9184-9189Google Scholar).The binding of IP3 to this receptor purified from mouse cerebella is stoichiometric (Kd = ∼100 nM, Hill coefficient = ∼1.0) (2Supattapone S. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1530-1534Google Scholar, 15Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Google Scholar). To localize the IP3 binding site, deletion mutagenesis studies showed that IP3R1 binds IP3 within the N-terminal 650 amino acids independently of the tetramer formation (16Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Google Scholar, 17Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4911-4915Google Scholar). Newton et al. (18Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Google Scholar) have reported that the N-terminal 576 amino acids fused to glutathione S-transferase specifically bound IP3 with high affinity, whereas further N- or C-terminal deletions of this region completely abolished the specific binding. Furthermore, Mourey et al. (19Mourey R.J. Estevez V.A. Marecek J.F. Barrow R.K. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1719-1726Google Scholar) have reported that residues 471-501 in this region were labeled with a photoaffinity ligand. These results indicated that the IP3 binding site is localized within the N-terminal 576 amino acids and consists of some distantly separated motifs.IP3 is characterized by three negatively charged phosphate groups at equatorial positions 1, 4, and 5 of an inositol ring. Ca2+ release experiments using various synthetic inositol phosphate analogues showed that the IP3 recognition site is markedly stereospecific (20Nahorski S.R. Potter B.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 139-144Google Scholar, 21Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Google Scholar, 22Hirata M. Yanaga F. Koga T. Ogasawara T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8404-8407Google Scholar). The ability of IP3 to release Ca2+ depends critically upon the positional distribution of the phosphate groups around the inositol ring, suggesting that binding sites for these three phosphate groups make major contributions to the recognition and binding of (1,4,5)IP3. Thus, it has been assumed that there is a pocket of positive charges that facilitate ionic interactions with the negative charges on these three phosphate groups. This hypothetical model is supported by the following evidence. IP3 binding to the platelet membrane is blocked by the specific Arg-modifying reagent, p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal, suggesting the involvement of Arg in the IP3 binding (23O'Rourke F. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 297-302Google Scholar). IP3 binding to the receptor is competitively blocked by heparin (24Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Supattapone S. Wilson V.S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12132-12136Google Scholar), and the IP3R protein has been purified by heparin affinity column chromatography (2Supattapone S. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1530-1534Google Scholar, 15Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Google Scholar). The known binding site for heparin in antithrombin III is highly basic because of enriched Arg or Lys residues (25Smith J.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11964-11972Google Scholar). The IP3 binding to the receptor is augmented with increasing pH over the range 5-9 (24Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Supattapone S. Wilson V.S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12132-12136Google Scholar). A study using NMR spectroscopy showed that IP3 dissociates protons from three phosphate groups over this pH range, indicating that the negative charges of IP3 contribute its binding to the receptor (26White A.M. Varney M.A. Watson S.P. Rigby S. Liu C.S. Ward J.G. Reese C.B. Graham H.C. Williams R.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 759-764Google Scholar). Finally, x-ray crystallographic studies of the pleckstrin homology domain of β spectrin and phospholipase C-δ, which bind IP3 but have no sequence homology with IP3R, in complex with IP3 showed that 2 and 5 positively charged amino acid residues of this domain, respectively, interact with the phosphate groups of IP3 (27Hyvonen M. Macias M.J. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Google Scholar, 28Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Google Scholar).Despite the above evidence, the detailed molecular structure of the IP3 binding site of the IP3R remains to be studied. In this study, we developed an Escherichia coli expression system for various recombinant IP3 binding sites of mouse IP3R1. The N-terminal 734 amino acids of IP3R1 (T734) expressed in E. coli exhibited similar binding characteristics to those of the native cerebellar IP3R. Eighteen deletion mutageneses of T734 showed that 353 amino acids (residues 226-578) are directly responsible for the IP3 binding. Furthermore, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on 41 basic amino acid residues within the N-terminal 650 amino acids of T734 and showed that 10 single amino acid substitutions markedly reduced the IP3 binding activity. They were scattered within residues 226-578 and conserved among all members of the IP3R family. Of these, three were critical for IP3 binding and one was involved in binding specificity. We discuss the structure of the IP3 binding site of the IP3R."

The expression of A20 in fibroblasts, B lymphocytes, WEHI 164, and NIH 3T3 cells confers resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis (2Opipari Jr., A. Hu H.M. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Our work demonstrates that expression of A20 dramatically inhibits TNF-induced EC activation, as shown by the inhibition of E-selectin (an endothelial cell-specific marker) (7Bevilacqua M.P.

The inhibitory effect of A20 is not only associated with TNF, but also affects LPS-, PMA-, and H2O2-induced EC activation. In addition, we show that A20 blocks the induction of a reporter construct that is dependent solely on NF-κB for its expression, demonstrating that the effect of A20 is mediated via the blockade of this transcription factor (14Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Google Scholar, 15Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 503-512Google Scholar). We suggest that, in EC, A20 functions to protect the cells not only from apoptosis but also from the potentially untoward effects of unfettered activation (16Pober J.S. Cotran R.S. Transplantation. 1990; 50: 537-544Google Scholar, 17Gerritsen M.E. Bloor C.M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 523-532Google Scholar). Bovine aortic endothelial cells were isolated and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and fetal calf serum (10%). Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were stimulated with either 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma Escherichia coli 0B55), 100 units/ml of recombinant human TNF (kind gift of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ), 5 × 10−8M of PMA (Sigma), or 300 µM of H2O2 (Sigma). To check for A20 expression in BAEC, transfected cells were washed twice with cysteine and methionine-free medium (ICN, Lisle, IL), and then placed in the same medium supplemented with 100 µCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN). Cells were labeled for 4 h before harvesting, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-human A20 polyclonal serum (kind gift of Dr. V. Dixit). 3 × 105 BAEC were plated per well in a six-well plate with 2 ml of medium. Cells were transfected once they had reached 70% confluence. 1.5-1.6 µg/well DNA (test plasmids and reporter constructs) were added to 8 µg of Lipofectamine/well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before being added to the cells in triplicate. In all experiments (except those with HIV-wild type (wt) reporter) 0.3 µg of the β-galactosidase (β-gal) reporter was used, with 0.5 to 0.7 µg of A20 or pAC, and 0.6 to 0.7 µg of the E-selectin, IL-8, TF, ECI-6, NF-κB, or RSV (Rous sarcoma virus)-luciferase (LUC) reporters. In those experiments involving the induction of the ECI-6 (IκBα) reporter by the p65 (RelA) expression vector, 40 ng of p65 were used. For the HIV-wt reporter experiments, 0.2 µg of the β-gal reporter was added, with 0.25 to 0.5 µg of A20 or pAC, 0.2 µg of the c-Tat expression plasmid, and 0.7 µg of the HIV-wt-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter. After a 5-h incubation, fetal calf serum was added to the medium to achieve a final concentration of 10%. 48 h later the cells were stimulated with either human recombinant TNF (100 units/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or PMA (5 × 10−8M) and were harvested 7 h after stimulation. In the experiments in which H2O2 (300 µM) was used to stimulate BAEC, cell harvests were performed 4 h after stimulation. Cellular extracts were assayed for β-gal activity per the Tropix, Inc. Galacto-Light protocol (Tropix, Inc, Bedford MA). Luciferase activity was assayed by adding 10 µl of cellular extract to 90 µl of a solution containing 24 mM glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 2 mM ATP (pH 7.5), and 10 mM MgSO4. Samples were read on the Microlumat LB 96P luminometer (EG+G Berthold) using an injection mix consisting of 24 mM glycylglycine and 0.1 mM luciferin (Boehringer Mannheim). The CAT assay was performed for the HIV-wt reporter by means of a standard method using a Promega kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, cell extracts were incubated in a reaction mix containing [14C]chloramphenicol and n-butyryl coenzyme A. The reaction products were then extracted with a small volume of xylene. After two back-extractions, a portion of the xylene phase was mixed with scintillation liquid and counted in a scintillation counter (1900 TR, Packard, Downes Grove, IL). The reporter construct used was made by one of the authors (C. B.) and represents bp −1286 to +484 of the porcine E-selectin promoter. This region includes the first complete intron and exon, as well as the beginning of the 2nd exon up to the ATG site. −1286 represents a NdeI site; +484 marks the position of the porcine (p) E-selectin translation start site. Just 3′ to the start ATG site a 3-bp insertion was made, creating an additional NdeI site. The promoter was cloned into the pMAMneo-LUC plasmid vector by replacing the mmTV promoter (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A gift from E. Hofer, VIRCC, Vienna, it represents the human IL-8 promoter linked to the luciferase gene (p-UBT LUC). The construction of this reporter has been previously described (11Moll T. Czyz M. Holzmuller H. Hofer-Warbinek R. Wagner E. Winkler H. Bach F.H. Hofer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3849-3857Google Scholar), and represents a −4000 to +34 fragment of the porcine TF promoter cloned into a luciferase expression vector (p-UBT LUC). The construction of this reporter has been previously described (13de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Google Scholar). It represents a 600-bp fragment of the porcine ECI-6/IκBα promoter ligated into the luciferase expression vector p-UBT (p-UBT-LUC) with the creation of an additional HindIII site. This reporter was constructed by one of the authors (A. P.). It consists of four copies of NF-κB elements taken from the porcine E-selectin promoter inserted upstream of a TK minimal promoter driving a luciferase gene. The vector backbone is a Bluescript KS+ plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla CA). The construction of this reporter has been previously described (18Zimmerman K. Dobrovnik M. Ballaun C. Bevec D. Hauber J. Böhlen E. Virology. 1991; 182: 874-878Google Scholar). It represents −117 bp to the TATA box start of the HIV-LTR, cloned upstream of the CAT gene (CAT3N polylinker). The full-length E. coli β-gal gene (Clontech) was inserted into the pRc/RSV vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) at the NotI site. This reporter was constructed by A. P. and represents the pRC/RSV vector (Invitrogen) associated with the full-length luciferase gene derived from pT3/T7-luc (Clontech). The A20 gene was obtained from V. Dixit and subcloned into the pAC expression vector at the XbaI restriction site. PAC is a 8.8-kb plasmid vector containing a CMV promoter, a pUC19 polylinker site, and a SV40 splice/poly(A) site (a kind gift of Robert Gerard, University of Texas, Southwestern). The p65 expression plasmid is a kind gift of Dr. J. Anrather and represents the human RelA (from amino acid 2 to 551) fused to a N-terminal c-myc Tag and cloned into the pcDNA 3 expression plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) at the HindIII/XbaI polycloning sites. C-Tat is an expression vector encoding the HIV-1 Tat protein that induces in a NF-κB independent manner, HIV-1 LTR-directed transcription (18Zimmerman K. Dobrovnik M. Ballaun C. Bevec D. Hauber J. Böhlen E. Virology. 1991; 182: 874-878Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized for β-gal by using the formula: luciferase activity/β-gal activity × 1000. Normalized luciferase activity is given in relative light units. For the CAT assay, counts/min were normalized for β-gal using the same formula. Significance was determined by the Student's t test (19Winer B.J. Statistical Principle in Experimental Design. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1971Google Scholar). BAEC transfected with A20 were radiolabeled with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine as described under “Material and Methods.” Cells were then harvested and cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human A20 anti-serum. The immunoprecipitated material was run on a polyacrylamide SDS-gel and showed the presence of the 80-kDa A20 protein (Fig. 1). HUVEC stimulated by TNF served as the positive control. The effect of A20 expression upon EC activation was first studied using an endothelial cell specific marker, E-selectin (6Pober J.S. Cotran R.S. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 427-451Google Scholar, 8Collins T. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 92-97Google Scholar). BAEC were co-transfected with the porcine E-selectin reporter construct as well as either the A20 expression plasmid or the pAC control plasmid in conjunction with the RSV β-gal plasmid. A titration curve was performed of the A20 plasmid with amounts of A20 ranging from 0.125 µg to 0.7 µg/5 × 105 BAEC. A20 overexpression led to a significant decrease in the luciferase activity of the E-selectin reporter after both TNF and LPS stimulation (number of experiments, n = 9). In the pAC control, induction with either TNF or LPS led to an 8- and 14-fold increase in the activity of the E-selectin reporter, respectively. A20 expression inhibited TNF- and LPS-induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). When 0.125 µg of A20 was used, the inhibition of induction reached 53% (p = 0.03) and 78% (p = 0.01) with TNF and LPS stimulation, respectively (Fig. 2, lane 5 versus 6, 9 versus 10). Inhibition was complete when the amount of A20 used was 0.5 µg and higher, if compared to the basal levels detected in the nonstimulated BAEC transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 2, lane 1 versus lanes 7, 8, 11, and 12). In addition, A20 expression decreased the basal, unstimulated luciferase activity of the E-selectin reporter by 2-fold when the amount of A20 used was 0.5 µg or higher (p = 0.02). These results show that 0.5-0.7 µg/5 × 105 BAEC of A20 is the optimal amount needed for maximal inhibition. The A20 dose used to analyze the other reporters was 0.5 µg/5 × 105 BAEC. In the next set of experiments we chose reporters constructed with promoters of genes that, like E-selectin, are up-regulated during EC activation: IL-8, porcine IκBα (ECI-6), and TF. Results demonstrate that A20 expression inhibited the TNF and LPS induction of all three reporters. The luciferase activity of the IL-8 reporter, when co-transfected with pAC alone, increased 2.5- and 2.7-fold after stimulation with TNF and LPS, respectively (Fig. 3A, lane 1 versus 3 and 5). A20 expression inhibited the induction of IL-8 reporter activity after TNF and LPS stimulation to levels below that seen with nonstimulated, pAC-transfected cells (60% below the luciferase activity of unstimulated cells, lane 1 versus 4 and 6 (p = 0.02)) (n = 5). Furthermore, A20 overexpression decreased the basal luciferase activity of the IL-8 reporter by 3-fold (Fig. 3A, lane 1 versus 2) (p < 0.0001). The results of the co-transfections performed using the porcine IκBα (ECI-6) reporter construct were similar to those seen with IL-8 (Fig. 3B). Induction with TNF and LPS reached 1.6- and 3.6-fold, respectively. Inhibition was complete when A20 was co-transfected. TNF- and LPS-induced luciferase activities were also lower than the basal levels noted with the empty vector (n = 6) (Fig. 3B, lane 1 versus 4 and 6) (p < 0.0001). A20 expression decreased by 5-fold the basal level of ECI-6 luciferase activity (Fig. 3B, lane 1 versus 2 (p < 0.0001)). In a comparable manner, A20 expression completely inhibited the 3.5- and 4.5-fold induction of TF reporter activity reached after TNF and LPS stimulation, respectively (Fig. 3C, lanes 3-6) (n = 6). However, unlike the IL-8 and ECI-6 reporters, there was no decrease in basal TF reporter activity with A20 co-expression (Fig. 3C, lane 1 versus 2). We further demonstrate using the E-selectin reporter construct that A20 expression inhibits both H2O2 and PMA-induced EC activation (Fig. 4A). BAEC were transfected as described previously with the A20 or pAC expression plasmids together with the E-selectin and β-gal reporters. BAEC were stimulated with either PMA at a concentration of 5 × 10−8M for 7 h prior to cell extraction, or with H2O2 at a concentration of 300 µM for 4 h prior to cell extraction. A20 expression totally inhibited the 2- and 2.5-fold induction of E-selectin reporter activity reached after H2O2 and PMA stimulation, respectively (Fig. 4A, lane 3 versus 4 (p = 0.001), 5 versus 6 (p < 0.0001) (n = 3)). BAEC were co-transfected with a NF-κB reporter construct that is solely dependent upon NF-κB, and either A20 or the empty vector, pAC. A20 expression abrogated the 12- and 28-fold induction of reporter activity in response to TNF and LPS, respectively (Fig. 5A, lane 3 versus 4, 5 versus 6) (n = 4). There was no significant difference in the basal levels of luciferase activity between A20 and pAC (Fig. 5A, lane 1 versus 2). Similarly, A20 expression eliminated the 2.2- and 4.9-fold induction of the NF-κB reporter following stimulation with H2O2 and PMA, respectively (Fig. 4B, lane 3 versus 4 (p = 0.0.006), 5 versus 6 (p = 0.01)). We further demonstrate that A20-related inhibition of NF-κB does not affect p65-mediated gene transactivation, since A20 expression in BAEC did not significantly modify the induction of the IκBα (ECI-6) reporter by p65 (Fig. 5B, lane 5 versus 6) as compared to TNF-induced activation (Fig. 5B, lane 3 versus 4). RSV-LUC is a constitutive reporter which is not dependent upon NF-κB. Basal luciferase activities of the RSV-LUC reporter were comparable in the A20 and pAC transfected BAEC. No significant induction was achieved upon TNF or LPS stimulation in either the pAC or the A20-expressing cells; luciferase values remained comparable among the 2 groups (Fig. 6A) (n = 6). With regard to HIV-CAT, Sp1 binding sites in the HIV-LTR reporter had been previously shown to be crucially involved in Tat-mediated gene expression (18Zimmerman K. Dobrovnik M. Ballaun C. Bevec D. Hauber J. Böhlen E. Virology. 1991; 182: 874-878Google Scholar), representing a means of gene induction independent of NF-κB. Our results show that A20 expression affected neither the basal levels nor the 10-15-fold induction of the reporter observed upon stimulation with c-Tat (Fig. 6B, lane 1 versus lanes 2-4 and lane 1 versus lanes 6-8). Endothelial cell activation refers to the changes that EC undergo as a result of cytokine stimulation (TNF, IL-1), inflammatory or infectious conditions, reperfusion injury, or rejection of an allo- or xenograft (6Pober J.S. Cotran R.S. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 427-451Google Scholar, 16Pober J.S. Cotran R.S. Transplantation. 1990; 50: 537-544Google Scholar, 17Gerritsen M.E. Bloor C.M.

With activation, the cells change their phenotype, leading to fluid leakage, transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium, as well as thrombosis. Activation involves the induction of a number of genes including adhesion molecules, cytokines, and prothrombotic molecules, many of which are dependent upon the action of NF-κB (8Collins T.

TNF induces the aforementioned genes of the activated EC, as well as other genes that confer protection against programmed cell death or apoptosis, such as A20 (1Dixit V.M. Green S. Sarma V.

We hypothesized that these genes might also affect other TNF-induced responses, in particular EC activation. To test our hypothesis, we transfected BAEC with reporter constructs consisting of promoters of genes known to be up-regulated during EC activation, i.e. E-selectin, IκBα, IL-8, and TF. Our results demonstrate that expression of A20 prevents gene induction associated with EC activation as shown by the total inhibition of all the above-mentioned reporters. Inhibition was seen when either TNF, LPS, H2O2, or PMA was used to stimulate the EC, pointing to the broad effect of A20 upon inhibiting gene induction. The comparable effect on TNF, LPS, H2O2, and PMA-induced signaling excludes any specific association of the action of A20 with the TNF response or the TNF receptor per se. The transcriptional factor NF-κB plays a major role in the up-regulation of the above tested reporters (8Collins T. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 92-97Google Scholar, 11Moll T. Czyz M. Holzmuller H. Hofer-Warbinek R. Wagner E. Winkler H. Bach F.H. Hofer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3849-3857Google Scholar, 13de Martin R.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Google Scholar). NF-κB is a ubiquitous transcription factor present in the cytoplasm of resting cells in association with its inhibitor, IκBα, and is involved in the acute phase response of inflammation (26Grilli M. Chiu J.J.S. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Google Scholar). However other transcriptional factors can bind to the promoters of these genes and are involved in the regulation of their expression, e.g. activating transcription factors and cyclic AMP-responsive element for E-selectin and Sp1 for TF (11Moll T. Czyz M. Holzmuller H. Hofer-Warbinek R. Wagner E. Winkler H. Bach F.H. Hofer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3849-3857Google Scholar, 27DeLuca L.G. Johnson D. Whitley M. Collins T. Pober J. J. Biol.

To evaluate the specific effect of A20 expression on NF-κB activation, we used a reporter construct dependent solely on NF-κB. Activation of this reporter by either TNF, LPS, PMA, or H2O2 was totally inhibited by expression of A20, demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of A20 on EC activation relates, at least in part and perhaps totally, to the inhibition of NF-κB. Our results partially contradict those recently reported by Jäättelä et al. (29Jäättelä M. Mouritzen H. Elling F. Bastholm L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1166-1173Google Scholar). In our system, A20 expression abrogates the PMA and the H2O2-induced activation of a NF-κB reporter, in contrast to her results, where no inhibition for either stimuli was seen (29Jäättelä M. Mouritzen H. Elling F. Bastholm L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1166-1173Google Scholar). In addition, we show total inhibition of NF-κB reporter induction by A20 expression in BAEC as opposed to the only partial inhibition seen in Jäättelä's results with the MCF-7S1 cell line. These discrepancies might relate to the type of cells used, i.e. the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7S1 versus primary cultures of EC. A20 function may differ in different cell types. This is in keeping with reports in the literature showing that A20 protects against serum-starvation induced apoptosis in B cell lines but is not able to do so in the MCF-7S1 breast carcinoma cell line (5Sarma V. Lin Z. Clark L. Rust B.M. Tewari M. Noelle R.J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12343-12346Google Scholar, 29Jäättelä M. Mouritzen H. Elling F. Bastholm L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1166-1173Google Scholar). The mechanism by which A20 affects NF-κB activation remains to be determined. Our data rules out an effect upon p65 (RelA)-mediated gene transactivation, since the induction of an IκBα reporter by p65 is not altered by A20 expression. To rule out nonspecific or toxic effects of A20 upon the transcriptional machinery, we tested a constitutive, noninducible reporter, RSV-LUC, as well as an HIV-CAT reporter. The HIV-CAT reporter is induced by the viral c-Tat protein through Sp1 binding sites and does not involve NF-κB (18Zimmerman K. Dobrovnik M. Ballaun C. Bevec D. Hauber J. Böhlen E. Virology. 1991; 182: 874-878Google Scholar). Expression of A20 had no effect on either the constitutive activity of the RSV-LUC reporter or the c-Tat stimulation of the HIV-CAT reporter, which also demonstrates a lack of effect of A20 on Sp1. We have demonstrated that, in addition to its ability to protect cells from apoptosis, expression of A20 inhibits NF-κB activation, and presumably based on this effect inhibits gene induction seen with EC activation. This new function places A20 in the same category as IκBα, i.e. genes that are dependent on NF-κB for their induction, but that subsequently inhibit NF-κB and thus EC activation (30Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Google Scholar, 31LaRue K.E.A. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Google Scholar, 32Krikos A. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17971-17976Google Scholar). Such genes presumably function in negative-regulatory loops to regulate the extent and duration of EC activation. The molecular basis of the inhibitory effect of A20 on EC activation is unknown. Based on the presence of zinc finger domains, it was previously hypothesized that A20 is a transcription factor that leads to gene induction (2Opipari Jr., A. Hu H.M. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Google Scholar, 33Berg J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 405-421Google Scholar). However, neither nuclear localization nor DNA binding was demonstrated in support of this hypothesis. One possible mechanism by which A20 could function is as an antioxidant. That A20 could be an antioxidant is consistent with its chemical structure, as the full-length human A20 cDNA encodes 7 Cys2/Cys2 repeats, which gives it a high zinc binding capacity (25Opipari A.J. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14705-14708Google Scholar). Furthermore, zinc can act as an antioxidant (34Bray T. Bettger W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 281-291Google Scholar, 35Hennig B. McClain C.J. Diana J.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 686: 99-109Google Scholar), and antioxidants such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate can prevent the gene induction associated with EC activation through the inhibition of NF-κB (14Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Google Scholar, 36Marui N. Offerman R. Swerlick C. Kunsch C. Rosen C.A. Ahmad M. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. J. Clin.

However, this hypothesis remains to be tested. Alternatively, the zinc associated with A20 may serve a structural role in stabilizing its functional domain(s) and facilitate its interaction with other proteins (38Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Google Scholar), e.g. those necessary for NF-κB activation. We propose that the antiapoptotic effect of A20 and its ability to down-regulate EC activation may both relate to a broader cell “protective” function for this gene. In addition to the rather obvious disadvantages to the cell of apoptotic death, uncontrolled and ongoing activation, involving the accumulation of damaging levels of reactive oxygen species, is clearly undesirable. If this speculation has validity, the presence of such protective genes may play a key role in the homeostatic regulation of endothelium, and perhaps other cellular systems. We are grateful to Drs. V. Dixit and M. Tewari for providing us with the A20 cDNA and for their helpful advice. We acknowledge Dr. J. Anrather for his pertinent input and for providing the p65 expression vector. We also thank E. Czismadia for her skilled technical assistance in cell culture."
https://openalex.org/W2089450781,"Mice deficient in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid biosynthesis, were constructed by targeted disruption of the Cyp7 gene. The introduced mutation removed exons 3-5 of the gene and gave rise to a null allele that encoded no immunoreactive or enzymatically active protein. Heterozygous carriers of the disrupted gene (Cyp7+/−) were phenotypically normal. Homozygous animals (Cyp7−/−) appeared normal at birth, but died within the first 18 days of life. Approximately 40% of the animals died between postnatal days 1 and 4 and 45% between days 11 and 18. The addition of vitamins to the water of nursing mothers prevented deaths in the early period, whereas the addition of cholic acid to chow prevented deaths in the later period. Newborn Cyp7−/− mice whose mothers were maintained on unsupplemented chow failed to gain weight at a normal rate and developed oily coats, hyperkeratosis, and apparent vision defects. These symptoms waned at 3 weeks of life, and their disappearance was accompanied by a marked increase in survival. In the accompanying study, the induction of an alternate pathway of bile acid biosynthesis is shown to underlie this unusual time course (Schwarz, M., Lund, E. G., Setchell, K. D. R., Kayden, H.

We conclude that cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase is an essential enzyme for normal postnatal development. A 12-kilobase (kb) 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)ESembryonic stem. fragment of the Mus musculus 7α-hydroxylase gene was enriched by sucrose gradient density ultracentrifugation of BamHI-digested genomic DNA isolated from the 129Sv strain. The resulting fraction was ligated into the bacteriophage λ DashII vector (Stratagene), and recombinant clones harboring the desired insert were identified by screening with a cDNA probe derived from the coding region of the mouse 7α-hydroxylase mRNA. The cDNA probe was originally amplified from mouse liver mRNA using oligonucleotide primers derived from the rat cDNA sequence (10Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Google Scholar). A replacement-type targeting vector was constructed as shown in Fig. 1A using the cloned genomic DNA fragment and a plasmid vector as templates. The short arm of the targeting vector (∼1.2 kb) represented a BamHI DNA fragment spanning intron 2 of the gene and was amplified from genomic DNA using two oligonucleotide primers (5′-primer = 5′-ATTTCATTACACTACTTCTGCGAAG-3′ and 3′-primer = 5′-TGGGTCTATGCTTCTGTGTCCAAAT-3′). The long arm of the targeting vector (∼12 kb) extended from a BamHI site in intron 5 to a BamHI site located 3′ of the 7α-hydroxylase gene. The Pol2sneobpA expression cassette (11Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Google Scholar) was positioned between the two murine DNA fragments (arms), and two copies of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene were located 5′ of the short arm of the vector (see Fig. 1A). kilobase(s) embryonic stem. Mouse AB-1 embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from the 129Sv strain were cultured on leukemia inhibitory factor-producing STO feeder cells as described (12Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 107 cells were electroporated (275 V, 330 millifarads) with 25 µg/ml targeting vector linearized with SalI using a device from Life Technologies, Inc. Electroporated cells were seeded onto irradiated (10,000 rads) feeder layers. After selection with 190 µg/ml G418 and 0.25 mM 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (Bristol Myers-Squibb), recombinant clones were identified by the polymerase chain reaction using a 5′-primer (5′-GAACCTCCTTTGGACAACGGGTTGA-3′) located in exon 2 of the 7α-hydroxylase gene and a 3′-primer (5′-AGGATTGGGAAGACAATAGCAGGCAT-3′) located within the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence of the neo expression cassette. Two independent stem cell clones (clones 86 and 193) containing a disrupted 7α-hydroxylase allele were identified among 500 colonies screened. The homologous recombination events in these two clones were verified by Southern blot analysis of BglII-digested cellular DNA using an intron 1 hybridization probe (see Fig. 1B). Both ES cell clones were injected into C57Bl/6J blastocysts, yielding 18 chimeric males whose coat color (agouti) indicated a contribution from the stem cells ranging from 20 to 95%. Of these chimeric males, two (both derived from ES clone 193) transmitted the disrupted 7α-hydroxylase gene through the germ line. All experiments reported here were performed with mixed strain (C57Bl/6J-129Sv) descendants (F2 and subsequent generations) of these animals. Enzyme assays, immunoblotting, and RNA blotting were carried out as described previously (10Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Google Scholar). The normal diet was mouse/rat diet 7001 (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) and contained ≥4% (w/w) fat, ≥24% (w/w) protein, and ≤5% (w/w) fiber. Where indicated, this diet was supplemented with 1% (w/w) cholic acid (Sigma). A vitamin supplement (CritterVites, Mardel Labs, Glendale Heights, IL) containing both water-soluble vitamins (thiamine, 180 mg/kg; riboflavin, 300 mg/kg; pantothenic acid, 600 mg/kg; niacin, 1500 mg/kg; vitamin B12, 150 µg/kg; vitamin B6, 150 mg/kg; folic acid, 100 mg/kg; and ascorbic acid, 9000 mg/kg) and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, 300,000 IU/kg; vitamin D3, 50,000 IU/kg; vitamin E, 750 IU/kg; and menadione, 250 mg/kg) was added to water bottles at the concentration (1 g/liter) recommended by the manufacturer. Vitamin supplements were replaced on a daily basis. The behavior of wild-type and 7α-hydroxylase-deficient mice in an open field was determined using a modification of a test described by Aiba et al. (13Aiba A. Kano M. Chen C. Stanton M.E. Fox G.D. Herrup K. Zwingman T.A. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1994; 79: 377-388Google Scholar). Disruption of the murine 7α-hydroxylase gene was carried out by standard methods in the 129Sv-derived ES cell line AB-1. A targeting vector was constructed as shown in Fig. 1A. Homologous recombination between this vector and a normal Cyp7 allele (14Tzung K. Ishimura-Ika K. Kihara S. Oka K. Chan L. Genomics. 1994; 21: 244-247Google Scholar) is expected to result in deletion of most of exon 3 and all of exons 4 and 5. Electroporation of the vector DNA followed by selection with neomycin and 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil yielded two ES cell lines that harbored the desired recombination event. For unknown reasons, the frequency of such clones was very low (0.4%). Both ES cell lines were injected into blastocysts derived from C57BL/6J female mice and subsequently implanted in pseudopregnant females. Two of the resulting chimeric male animals transmitted the disrupted 7α-hydroxylase gene through the germ line as judged by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA derived from tail segments. The data of Fig. 1B show that crossing male and female animals heterozygous for the mutant allele resulted in offspring of both sexes with all three of the expected genotypes at the Cyp7 locus. The 6.0-kb BglII DNA fragment characteristic of the disrupted gene and/or the 3.5-kb BglII DNA fragment characteristic of the normal gene was present in the expected Mendelian ratios in the offspring of this and other crosses. To confirm that deletion of exons 3-5 of the gene abolished 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity, extracts of microsomal membranes prepared from the livers of animals with different genotypes were incubated with [14C]cholesterol in the presence of NADPH. As shown in Fig. 2A, wild-type mice express an enzyme activity capable of hydroxylating cholesterol at the 7α-position (lanes 5 and 6). Extracts prepared from animals heterozygous for the disrupted Cyp7 gene contain approximately one-half the amount of enzyme activity present in wild-type tissue (lanes 3 and 4), whereas extracts from Cyp7−/− animals contain little or no cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity (lanes 1 and 2). In control experiments, the production of 7α-hydroxycholesterol in the assay was dependent on the presence of both NADPH cofactor and microsomal protein (lanes 7 and 8). Immunoblotting of liver extracts prepared from mice homozygous for the disrupted gene also revealed the loss of a protein with a size and migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels characteristic of 7α-hydroxylase (Fig. 2B). An antibody raised against a highly purified preparation of the rat enzyme (10Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Google Scholar) recognized a cluster of cytochrome P450 proteins in rat liver extracts that migrated with molecular weights in the 50,000 range (lanes 1 and 2). Within this group of proteins, the 7α-hydroxylase enzyme is known to have the slowest electrophoretic mobility (10Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Google Scholar). In liver extracts from wild-type mice, this antibody recognized two major proteins, one of which had a molecular weight identical to that of the rat 7α-hydroxylase enzyme (lanes 7 and 8). The intensity of this putative murine 7α-hydroxylase protein in liver extracts prepared from Cyp7+/− animals (lanes 5 and 6) was approximately one-half that detected in normal mice, while this protein was not detected in Cyp7−/− animals (lanes 3 and 4). The intensity of the other major cross-reacting protein, a presumed cytochrome P450 that has a lower molecular weight than the 7α-hydroxylase protein, also declined in the homozygous animals (lanes 3 and 4). This decline appeared to be due to an overall decrease in the content of cytochrome P450 enzymes present in the livers of Cyp7−/− mice (see below). RNA blotting of poly(A)+-enriched mRNA fractions from mice of different Cyp7 genotypes was performed next. As illustrated by the data of Fig. 3, wild-type mice contain several cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNAs, with major species at ∼4.4 and ∼7.0 kb. Heterozygous animals appear to contain slightly more of these same mRNAs and, in addition, a new mRNA migrating with a size of ∼5.0 kb. Cyp7−/− animals contain the latter mRNA, but none of the mRNA species present in wild-type mice. RNA blotting, cDNA cloning, and DNA sequencing experiments revealed that the novel mRNA present in the Cyp7+/− and Cyp7−/− animals was a hybrid mRNA composed of sequences derived from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the mutated Cyp7 gene and the inserted neomycin resistance gene (data not shown). Control RNA blotting experiments (Fig. 3, lower panel) showed that the levels of sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA and β-actin mRNA in the liver did not differ between wild-type and mutant Cyp7 mice. A phenotype associated with the absence of 7α-hydroxylase became apparent upon breeding heterozygous animals. Homozygous pups arising from these crosses failed to thrive and experienced a very high rate of perinatal mortality. We hypothesized that death was caused by a deficiency of bile acids and a subsequent failure to absorb fat-soluble vitamins from the diet. To test this hypothesis, nursing mothers were placed on diets supplemented with vitamins and cholic acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The survival rate of the Cyp7−/− animals increased dramatically upon dietary supplementation for a period of 30 days. Thereafter, the mutant animals could be switched to normal chow with no decrease in survival. Using this supplementation regime, the mutant mouse colony was expanded to produce sufficient animals to characterize in detail their phenotype and the effects of individual dietary supplements. We first determined the survival rate of animals born to Cyp7−/− mothers in the absence of supplementation. As shown in Fig. 4A, ∼85% of the pups arising from crosses of homozygous animals died within the first 18 days of postnatal life. Death occurred in two temporal waves, with ∼40% of the pups succumbing prior to day 4 and the remainder dying between days 11 and 17. The 10-15% of the homozygous animals that survived until day 18 showed a near normal survival rate over the following 12 days (Fig. 4A). In these experiments, all pups suckled regardless of genotype, and milk was visible in the stomachs and intestines of the animals. Thus, death could not be attributed to the absence of alimentation. Homozygous pups defecated clay-colored, fatty stools, indicative of fat malabsorption (steatorrhea). The effects of individual dietary supplements on animal survival were determined next. As shown in Fig. 4B, the presence of vitamins in the water decreased the numbers of deaths that occurred in the first few days of life, but did not prevent the second wave of death. Conversely, cholic acid supplementation of the mother's diet had no effect on the number of early deaths, but prevented the second temporal wave of death in the homozygous pups (Fig. 4B). The death curve of Cyp7−/− pups nursed by mothers given both vitamins and cholic acid is shown in Fig. 4C. When the supplements were begun on the day the pups were born, ∼60% of the pups died during postnatal days 1-14. All of the animals that survived to day 15 remained alive at day 30. In contrast, when the dual supplementation was begun on gestation day 12 (i.e. before the pups were born), the survival rate of homozygous pups (Fig. 4C) was indistinguishable from that of wild-type pups born to mothers fed normal chow (Fig. 4A). Taken together, the results of the feeding studies indicated that 7α-hydroxylase-deficient animals suffered from a vitamin shortage immediately after birth and from a bile acid shortage around the second week of life. Mutant mice born to Cyp7−/− mothers maintained on normal chow were noticeably smaller than age-matched heterozygous or wild-type pups. To quantify this difference, weight gain in newborn animals was measured as a function of age and genotype. The data of Fig. 5 indicate that wild-type pups gained weight at an essentially linear rate during postnatal days 1-30. In contrast, homozygous pups gained weight at a slower rate until day 5 and then experienced a period of weight stagnation until day 11 (Fig. 5). After day 11, surviving mutant pups sustained a progressive weight gain, but at a slower rate compared with wild-type animals. A comparison of the death curve shown in Fig. 4 and the weight gain curve of the homozygous animals shown in Fig. 5 indicates that weight stagnation in the postnatal day 5-11 period was not accompanied by death of the pups. Cyp7−/− pups born to mothers whose diets were supplemented with vitamins and cholic acid during and after gestation gained weight at a normal rate (data not shown). A second striking phenotype associated with disruption of the 7α-hydroxylase gene was an abnormality of the fur. As shown in Fig. 6 (upper panel), nursing wild-type mothers have a glossy smooth pelt. In contrast, nursing homozygous mothers and, more surprisingly, nursing heterozygous mothers developed an unusually oily coat (a “Brylcream phenotype”) between days 4 and 7 of the nursing period (center panel). Approximately 3-4 days after a mother developed this phenotype, her pups also developed an oily hide (lower panel). In mothers, this phenotype persisted for a period of at least 7-8 days and as long as 14 days. The duration and extent of the symptom appeared to be directly related to the number of pups nursed. Females nursing larger litters exhibited a more severe phenotype for longer periods of time compared with mothers with smaller litters. Pups remained oily for ∼7 days after the onset of symptoms, and most of them died within this period. In contrast, lactating females maintained on a 4% fat diet supplemented with 1% cholic acid did not develop the greasy phenotype, nor did the pups of these animals manifest the symptom. Vitamin supplementation alone had no effect on the development of the oily coat (data not shown). During the nursing period, pups and young animals deficient in 7α-hydroxylase also exhibited the phenotype shown in Fig. 7. The photograph shows the skin of a day 5 pup, which is characterized by a dry, scaly appearance. This feature of the deficient mice is easiest to visualize before the growth of fur (Fig. 7); however, the symptom persists throughout the nursing period. In addition, older Cyp7−/− animals showed eye abnormalities, including delayed opening and excess secretion emanating from the unopened oculi (data not shown). The eyelids of deficient animals opened ∼8-9 days later than those of control mice. The data of Fig. 8 show a histological analysis of the skin of wild-type and Cyp7−/− pups. The upper panel represents an abdominal skin section of a day 14 wild-type animal that exhibited a normal histology. In contrast, the skin of an age-matched Cyp7−/− pup that showed the scaly skin phenotype of Fig. 7 reveals a thickened and torn stratum corneum layer (hyperkeratosis) and a thickened granular layer (lower panel). The cells of the spinous and basal layers of the epidermis as well as the dermis of the homozygous animals appeared compressed relative to the wild-type specimen. Liver histology in the deficient animals was normal, with well formed lobules and alternating central vein and portal triad architecture (data not shown). Yellow crystalline deposits were observed in the bile canaliculi of young mice. The level of conjugated bilirubin was higher in the livers of Cyp7−/− mice (28.2 ± 2.8 µg/mg tissue, n = 3) than in age-matched wild-type controls (2.6 µg/mg ± 0.5, n = 3). Finally, spectrophotometric scans of liver membrane proteins revealed an ∼50% decrease in A450 absorbing material in the deficient versus wild-type animals (data not shown). These results, which indicate a decrease in liver cytochrome P450 content in the Cyp7−/− mice, further suggest a disruption of heme metabolism in this organ. Young Cyp7−/− animals, after they had opened their eyes, appeared to be less active than wild-type counterparts. To confirm this observation, the feet of animals of different genotypes were dipped in blue ink (wild-type) or red ink (Cyp7−/−), and the mice were placed in the upper right-hand corner of an enclosed sheet of filter paper (46 × 57 cm). The mice were then allowed to roam undisturbed for 1 min. This procedure was repeated 11 additional times for each mouse. The wild-type mouse actively explored the enclosure as indicated by the presence of blue footprints over much of the paper (Fig. 9). The majority of the movements of the wild-type mouse were confined to the perimeter of the enclosure, but the animal also crossed over the center of the paper. The concentration of blue footprints in each of the four corners reflects the animal's attempts to peer over and to climb out of the enclosure. In contrast to these results, a Cyp7−/− animal confined its movements to one side of the paper, persistently ambling up and down the wall adjacent to the corner in which it was placed (Fig. 9, red footprints). This behavior suggests that the Cyp7−/− mice have vision problems that render them dependent on tactile stimulation for location cues and subsequent movement. We provide evidence that 7α-hydroxylase activity is important in murine postnatal life. The majority of mice that lack this enzyme die within 18 days of birth. Death is preceded by abnormally slow weight gain, fatty stools, hyperkeratosis, an unusual appearance of the fur, and behavioral abnormalities. These symptoms are representative of those associated with fat malabsorption (wasting and steatorrhea) and fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption (skin, fur, and vision pathologies), and their occurrence in Cyp7−/− mice suggests that the bile acid pathway initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by 7α-hydroxylase is crucial for nutritional homeostasis in the neonate. No decrease in fecundity (litter size) or effects on fertility were detected in Cyp7−/− females, suggesting that 7α-hydroxylase is not required for embryonic development or reproduction. At birth, 7α-hydroxylase-deficient mice appear phenotypically normal. However, shortly thereafter, many of the homozygous animals begin to succumb to the deficiency. Deaths cluster in two time periods, days 1-4 and days 12-17 (Fig. 4A). Animals that survive through day 4 remain alive until day 12, at which time another 40% expire during the second period of increased death. The animals that survive through day 17 (∼15% of the total) thereafter have lifespans that approximate those of wild-type mice. Dietary supplementation experiments provide a potential explanation for the observed biphasic death curve. Pups born to mothers supplemented with a combination of fat- and water-soluble vitamins survive the first wave of early postnatal demise, but succumb to the second (Fig. 4B). In these experiments, vitamins were added to the mothers' water supply, which the nursing pups cannot reach and thus do not have direct access to. Given this mode of delivery, the simplest interpretation of the rescue data is that the early deaths are a consequence of a vitamin deficiency due to a decrease in the vitamin content of the mother's milk. The metabolism of postpartum animals changes radically with the onset of lactation since vastly more nutritional resources must be committed to the production of milk. The stress imparted by these metabolic changes is presumably revealing a phenotype (avitaminosis) in the deficient mothers that is otherwise not detectable in non-nursing females. If this interpretation is correct, then the physiological stress imparted to the Cyp7−/− mothers by lactation and nursing overwhelms their capacity to solubilize sufficient vitamins to meet the needs of the pups. The resulting low levels of vitamins in the mother's milk, combined with the pups' deficiency in bile acids, leads to the failure of the pups to absorb sufficient vitamins to maintain survival. Supplementation of the mother provides high enough levels of vitamins to the pups such that a sufficient amount can be absorbed to stave off death. In the accompanying paper (15Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Björkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18024-18031Google Scholar), we show that Cyp7−/− mice are deficient in vitamins D3 and E; thus, it seems likely that deficiency in one or more of the fat-soluble vitamins underlies the first wave of postnatal death. This deduction is in part based on the known role of bile acids in facilitating the uptake of fat-soluble vitamins (1Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Arias I. Popper H. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, New York1982: 467Google Scholar) and the fact that mice lacking apolipoprotein B expression in the intestine, which are defective in fat-soluble vitamin uptake, also die at a high rate in early postnatal life (16Young S.G. Cham C.M. Pitas R.E. Burri B.J. Connolly A. Flynn L. Pappu A.S. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2932-2946Google Scholar). Alternatively, the phenotype of the 7α-hydroxylase-deficient mice may reflect a deficiency of both water- and fat-soluble classes of vitamins in that the malabsorption accompanying the defect could lead to a generalized loss of vitamins. The phenotype of the Cyp7−/− mice does not match the symptoms associated with a deficiency of any single water-soluble vitamin in the mouse (17Jones J.H. Foster C. Dorfman F. Hunter G.L. J. Nutr. 1945; 29: 127-136Google Scholar), except perhaps folic acid. This vitamin is moderately soluble in water (1.6 µg/ml at 25°C), and a deficiency in the mouse leads to weight loss and the appearance of an “untidy hair coat” (18Darby W.J. Jones E. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1945; 60: 259-260Google Scholar), which resembles that of the 7α-hydroxylase-deficient animals (Fig. 6). We are carrying out supplementation studies in which individual vitamin classes or vitamins are given to the deficient animals in an attempt to identify the active substance in the current pan supplement. An unanswered question that arises from the feeding experiments is why supplementation with vitamins and bile acids beginning on postnatal day 1 did not prevent deaths in the initial period (Fig. 4C), whereas supplementation with vitamins alone did (Fig. 4B). A generalized toxicity of the combined supplements can be ruled out since their administration during gestation increased pup survival (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that the metabolism, maternal-fetal transfer, or uptake of bile acids or vitamins changes in some as yet undefined manner at term or shortly thereafter. Pups born to mothers fed a chow diet supplemented with 1% cholic acid die at the expected rate during the first lethal period, but survive the second wave of death (Fig. 4B). Death during the second period, but not the first, is preceded by the development of an oily coat in unsupplemented nursing mothers and their pups. In the vitamin supplementation experiments, we are certain that the pups did not gain direct access to the water bottles containing vitamins. However, in the case of the cholic acid supplementation experiments, the supplemented chow was strewn about the cage and adhered to the fur of both mothers and pups. Since the pups groom themselves, they may have consumed some of the cholic acid present in the chow. Thus, reversal of the second wave of death may have been due to alleviation of a maternal defect or an offspring defect associated with bile acid deficiency. A clue to understanding why the deficient mice die during postnatal days 11-17 may lie in determining the cause of the oily coat as cholic acid-supplemented animals did not die and did not develop this phenotype. We initially hypothesized that the second period of death might be due to the deficiency of an essential fatty acid. Diets lacking in these fats (linolenic acid and linoleic acid) give rise to hyperkeratosis and excess water loss in mice (19Holman R.T. Lipids. 1969; 9: 275-348Google Scholar), which is a phenotype that resembles the deficient mice of this study. However, as indicated in the accompanying paper (15Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Björkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18024-18031Google Scholar), 7α-hydroxylase-deficient mice have near normal levels of essential fatty acids. Thus, the second period of death may result from the accumulation of a toxic intermediate in the bile acid pathway, a secondary sterol, or a lipid metabolite in the Cyp7−/− pups and their mothers. Alternatively, the animals may die of malnutrition caused by a failure to solubilize milk fats during the first 18 days of life.

INTRODUCTIONIntegral membrane proteins of intracellular storage vesicles in the regulated pathway of secretion are thought to play a central role in the mechanism of exocytosis and its regulation. They are also presumed to be involved in membrane recycling following exocytosis and in transmembrane signal transduction during the biogenesis, maturation, and senescence of these organelles. The synaptic vesicle has been well characterized, but our knowledge of the membrane proteins of the dense core secretory granule is sketchy and largely confined to proteins that have a tissue-specific function and whose activities relate to maintenance of the lumenal environment. Such molecules include dopamine β-hydroxylase and cytochrome b561 of the chromaffin granule (1Winkler H. Carmichael S.W. Poisner A.M. Trifaró J.M. The Secretory Granule. Elsevier Holland, Amsterdam1982: 3Google Scholar), glycoproteins 1 and 2 of pancreatic acinar granules (2Scheele G.A. Poisner A.M. Trifaró J.M. The Secretory Granule. Elsevier Holland, Amsterdam1982: 213Google Scholar), P-selectin in platelets and endothelium (3Disdier M. Morrissey J.H. Fugate R.D. Bainton D.F. McEver R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 309-321Google Scholar), and the peptide amidating monoxygenase of cells of a neuroendocrine lineage (4Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 333-344Google Scholar). A new series of dense core granule candidate proteins has recently emerged either as a result of polymerase chain reaction-based searches for homologues of proteins implicated in intracellular membrane traffic or by examining the subcellular distribution of synaptic vesicle membrane proteins in granulated cell types. Small GTP-binding proteins, in particular isoforms of Rab3 (5Mollard G.F. Stahl B. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 164-168Google Scholar), as well as the synaptic vesicle constituents synaptotagmin (6Walch-Solimena C. Takei K. Marek K.L. Midyett K. Südhof T.C. de Camilli P. Jahn R. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3895-3903Google Scholar) and vesicle-associated membrane protein/synaptobrevin-2 (7Regazzi R. Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Theler J.M. Rossetto O. Montecucco C. Sadoul K. Weller U. Palmer M. Thorens B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2723-2730Google Scholar, 8Papini E. Rossetto O. Cutler D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1332-1336Google Scholar) have been documented by such approaches. The need remains, however, to identify other functionally important dense core granule proteins and to establish granule-specific markers for cell biological studies of granule membrane traffic.An alternative approach to the biochemical or genetic identification of dense core granule membrane proteins has been the use of monoclonal antibodies raised to secretory granule preparations (9Grimaldi K.A. Hutton J.C. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 567-573Google Scholar, 10Brand S.H. Laurie S.M. Mixon M.B. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18949-18957Google Scholar). Such efforts have been hampered by the apparent immunodominance of a small subset of constituents that are either quantitatively insignificant components in the membranes or contaminants from other subcellular compartments. Moreover, the antibodies so produced are often unsuitable for cDNA expression library screening because of the dependence of the signal generated on the preservation of a single conformational epitope in the expressed recombinant proteins. To minimize these problems, an expression screening procedure based on polyclonal sera raised to highly enriched insulinoma secretory granule membranes was used in these studies. Secondary screening of candidate clones was achieved by Western blotting of tissues and subcellular fractions with antibodies affinity-purified on the recombinant antigens. We report here the characterization of a novel dense core secretory granule transmembrane PTP 1The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseTBSTris-buffered saline (pH 8)aaamino acid(s)ntnucleotide(s)bpbase pair(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. homologue, phogrin (phosphatase homologue in granules of insulinoma), which was cloned by this approach.MATERIALS AND METHODSUnless otherwise stated, all molecular cloning procedures were performed by standard protocols (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma. The cell lines αTC2 (mouse glucagonoma), βTC3 (mouse insulinoma), CRI-G1, CRI-D11, and RIN m5F (rat insulinoma), AtT20 (mouse pituitary corticotroph), PC12 (rat phaeochromocytoma), NIH 3T3 (mouse fibroblast), and COS 7 (monkey kidney epithelium) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mML-glutamine at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2-95% air mixture until they were subconfluent. INS-1 cells (rat insulinoma) were cultivated in modified RPMI (12Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Google Scholar). Rat tissues were obtained from 6-12-week-old New England Deaconess Hospital rats. Pancreatic islets were prepared from the same animals by collagenase digestion (13Guest P.C. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 431-437Google Scholar). Rat insulinomas (14Chick W.L. Warren S. Shute R.N. Like A.A. Lauris V. Kitchen K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 628-632Google Scholar) were propagated by subcutaneous transplantation in New England Deaconess Hospital rats, and viable tumor cells were purified on Percoll density gradients (15Tooke N.E. Hales C.N. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 471-480Google Scholar).A cDNA expression library was constructed in the vector pUEX2 (16Bressan G.M. Stanley K.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10056Google Scholar) using BamHI adaptors (Amersham Int., Slough, UK) coupled to double-stranded cDNA derived from poly(A)+ mRNA extracted from viable rat insulinoma cells. Insulin secretory granules were isolated from a homogenate of the same tissue using either a continuous Percoll density gradient (17Hutton J.C. Penn E.J. Peshavaria M. Diabetologia. 1982; 23: 365-373Google Scholar) (“Percoll granules”) or discontinuous Nycodenz gradient procedure (18Roep B.O. Arden S.D. Vries R.R.P.d. Hutton J.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 632-634Google Scholar) (“crude granules”) under isotonic conditions. Granule membranes were prepared from the Percoll granules by sonication in 10 mM NH4 HCO3, 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.9) and separated into a “soluble” and “membrane” fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The membranes were further washed with 1 M KCl in the same buffer, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and used to immunize 5 Duncan Hartley guinea pigs (200 µg of protein intradermally in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by 100 µg subcutaneously in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 6-week intervals). Sera were pooled from several bleeds of all animals to ensure the broadest antigenic specificity.Identification and Isolation of Secretory Granule Membrane ProteinsInitial screening of 5 × 105 clones of the library was performed as described (19Stanley K.K. Luzio J.P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1429-1434Google Scholar) by using a 1:1000 dilution of the sera. 102 selected clones were rescreened using guinea pig antisera generated to an insulin granule soluble fraction and an insulinoma “cytosolic” fraction to eliminate those that corresponded to peripherally associated granule proteins. The 24 remaining clones were sequenced from their 5′ and 3′ ends using the dideoxy chain termination procedure (Sequenase, version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Clone-specific antibodies were affinity-purified from the original sera by a modification of the basic Western blotting procedure (20Guest P.C. Pipeleers D. Rossier J. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 503-508Google Scholar) in which the expressed recombinant β-galactosidase fusion proteins were electrophoresed on 5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (50 µg/cm2), which was used as an affinity matrix to adsorb specific antibodies from serum diluted 1:40 in 50 mM Tris containing 150 mM NaCl (TBS), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder (Cadbury's Marvel). Elution was performed in 100 mM glycine (pH 2.5), and the eluate was immediately neutralized with Tris base.Cross-blot AnalysesCultured cells were sonicated in ice-cold TBS and separated into particulate and soluble fractions by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min in a microfuge. Samples (45 µg of protein) were solubilized in 50 µl of 8 M urea/10 mM CHAPS, diluted to 200 µl with TBS, and transferred as 2 mm × 12 cm lanes onto a nitrocellulose sheet. The sheet was then blocked with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder and developed in the second dimension by Western blotting with different affinity-purified antibodies again run as 2 mm × 12 cm lanes. Subcellular fractions were applied and treated in an identical manner.Cloning of PhogrinThe above screening procedure yielded two independent overlapping clones (nt 1425-2484 and 1455-2484; see Fig. 2). 38 further clones ranging from 500 to 3500 bp were obtained by rescreening the insulinoma library with the insert from the latter clone (pxM35) radiolabeled (Oligolabeling kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham). All the clones appeared to be derived from the same mRNA, based on restriction mapping with BamHI and on sequence information obtained from their 5′ and 3′ ends. A further screening was performed with a 5′ probe (nt 214-759) to obtain the remaining 5′ 214 bp of sequence, and a composite construct was created in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Abingdon, UK) for further studies.Expression of PhogrinSequences corresponding to part of the lumenal (aa 260-598) and the cytosolic regions (aa 629-1003) of the mature protein were subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site in the expression vector pGEX-3X (21Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar) using a polymerase chain reaction-based procedure with 34- or 35-mer oligonucleotides including the appropriate restriction sites. The recombinant soluble glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography (21Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar) for subsequent use as immunogens for polyclonal rabbit antiserum production.In vitro translation analyses were performed with T7 RNA polymerase transcripts of the full-length clone (0.1 µg of RNA/25 µl incubation) in a reticulocyte lysate/dog pancreatic microsome system (Promega, Madison, WI) using [35S]methionine (Amersham) as the radioactive precursor. The efficiency of translocation of the products into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum was assessed by incubation for 30 min at 0°C with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim). The glycosylation state of the translated proteins was evaluated using endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously (22Guest P.C. Arden S.D. Bennett D.L. Clark A. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22401-22406Google Scholar). Radiolabeled products were separated on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by phosphor imaging (Fuji BAS 2000, Sheffield, UK) after drying.Northern Blot AnalysesA mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (5 µg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane) was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA from cell lines was extracted by homogenization in 6 M guanidinium HCl, 8% (w/v) mercaptoethanol, 2% (v/v) laurylsarkosinate followed by CsCl step gradient centrifugation (23Chirgwin J.M. Pryzbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ mRNA was then prepared by oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography. Total RNA from pancreatic islets was extracted using RNAzol™ B reagent (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were analyzed by Northern blotting after electrophoresis on denaturing formaldehyde gels. Blots were hybridized for 16 h at 42°C in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's reagent, 2% SDS, and 100 µg/ml salmon testis DNA and finally washed in 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 50°C. 32P-Radiolabeled randomly primed probes were generated from a 797-bp HindIII fragment of the cDNA (nt 444-1241) and from mouse actin. Visualization and quantitation of blots was performed by phosphor imaging.Western Blot AnalysesRat tissues were transferred immediately into liquid nitrogen and pulverized while frozen with a mortar and pestle, and 100 mg of wet weight was sonicated for 20 s (MSE Soniprep) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8). Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min in a refrigerated microcentrifuge to obtain a particulate fraction. This was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (20Guest P.C. Pipeleers D. Rossier J. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 503-508Google Scholar) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) and ECL (Amersham) as the detection systems.Subcellular Fractionation AnalysesRat insulinoma tissue (10 g of wet weight) was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 0.3 M sucrose, 10 mM MES K+, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4 (pH 6.5) at 4°C as described previously (17Hutton J.C. Penn E.J. Peshavaria M. Diabetologia. 1982; 23: 365-373Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min; the supernatant was then subjected to sequential centrifugation at 4°C at 3000 × g for 20 min and 30,000 × g for 20 min. The 30,000 × g pellet was resuspended in 7.5 ml of homogenization medium. For Percoll gradients 2.5 ml were mixed with 7.5 ml of 36% (v/v) Percoll containing 0.3 M sucrose, 10 mM MES K+, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, (pH 6.5) and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 45 min in a Sorvall T1270 rotor (DuPont, Stevenage, UK). The gradient was divided into 10 fractions, and the particulate material was recovered by repeated dilution of each fraction with 3 volumes of homogenization medium followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Spinco, Palo Alto, CA). For Nycodenz gradients 5 ml of resuspended 30,000 × g pellet was layered onto a 27 ml of preformed linear gradient of 7.5-35% (w/v) Nycodenz (Nycomed AS, Oslo, Norway) in 10 mM MES K+, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, (pH 6.5) osmotically balanced (300 mosm/liter) with sucrose and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 14 h in a Sorvall AH625 rotor. The gradient was divided into 20 fractions. Fractions were assayed for insulin (granules), aryl sulfatase (lysosomes), NADPH cytochrome c reductase (endoplasmic reticulum), galactosyl transferase (Golgi), and cytochrome c oxidase (mitochondria) (17Hutton J.C. Penn E.J. Peshavaria M. Diabetologia. 1982; 23: 365-373Google Scholar). Western blotting analyses were performed using antibodies that had been affinity-purified on the original β-galactosidase fusion protein (see above), antisera raised to the glutathione S-transferase recombinant protein, antisera to cathepsin D (lysosomal marker), and carboxypeptidase H (secretory granule marker).Protease Protection of Native PhogrinFreshly prepared crude secretory granules (300 µg of protein) were incubated in 200 µl of 0.3 M sucrose, 10 mM MES K+, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4 (pH 6.5) for 30 min at 0°C with 0.1 mg/ml Proteinase K or trypsin (Sigma type XIII) with or without 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteases were inactivated with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and Western blotting.Biosynthetic Labeling of Insulinoma CellsViable insulinoma tumor cells (2-4 × 106 cells/incubation) were preincubated for 60 min in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then pulse-labeled for 30 min in medium containing 100 µCi of Tran35S label and chased in the presence of 2 mM unlabeled methionine and cysteine. The cells were then rinsed in TBS, lysed in TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µM pepstatin A, and 10 µM E64, and subjected to immunoprecipitation and analysis by SDS-PAGE essentially as described previously (22Guest P.C. Arden S.D. Bennett D.L. Clark A. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22401-22406Google Scholar).Other AnalysesProtein was determined with BCA reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Samples were preincubated at 60°C for 10 min in 10 µl of 1% (w/v) SDS to solubilize membrane proteins or inclusion bodies before assay. Computational analyses were performed with the Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin package via the Human Genome Mapping Project (Sanger Centre, Hinxton, Cambs, UK).RESULTSThe initial screening of 5 × 105 clones from a rat insulinoma cDNA expression library with pooled guinea pig sera raised to an insulinoma granule membrane preparation revealed 34 strongly reactive colonies together with several hundred moderately and weakly reactive ones. 68 of the latter group were selected together with all the strongly reactive clones for colony purification and further analysis on the premise that these would include most of the low abundance membrane proteins and functionally important proteins that might be weakly immunogenic because of their conserved sequence. Subsequent screening with polyclonal sera raised to soluble granule proteins and to cytosolic proteins eliminated all but 24 clones, which represented 14 different sequences as ascertained by their having unique 5′ and 3′ nucleotide sequences. Two of these corresponded to the synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptophysin, one to lysosomal CD63, one to the cytoskeletal protein cytokeratin 8, one to the soluble transcription factor TF S-II, and one to α-actinin but in the antisense orientation. The remaining 8 sequences were unrelated to documented sequences in the GenBank™ and EMBL data bases (November, 1995).Immunocross-blotting experiments (Fig. 1) performed with antibodies from the original sera, which had been affinity-purified on the respective β-galactosidase fusion proteins, suggested that one of the novel clones, number 35, was a good candidate for a secretory granule integral membrane protein of β-cells because reactivity was concentrated in membrane fractions enriched in granules (Fig. 1A). It also appeared to be present in other cells of neuroendocrine lineage, mainly confined to the particulate fraction, and was absent in normal rat kidney cells (Fig. 1B). The ability of this technique to discriminate between antigens localized elsewhere in the cell is illustrated in the case of clone number 9, which was more abundant in a membrane fraction of lower buoyant density, and cytokeratin 8, which was associated with all particulate fractions. CD63 immunoreactivity was detected in all cells and in insulinoma cells had an ambiguous distribution including both granule-rich and lysosome-containing fractions.Fig. 1Cross-blot analysis of the cellular and subcellular distribution of cloned antigens reactive to anti-granule membrane antibodies. Samples of different subcellular fractions of rat insulinoma (A) and rodent cell lines (B) were transferred to nitrocellulose as a parallel vertical array in the first dimension and developed by a Western blotting procedure in the second dimension using antibodies affinity-purified on the designated fusion proteins or the wild-type β-galactosidase (Cont.). A, subcellular fractions 1-4 were derived from discontinuous Nycodenz gradients (18Roep B.O. Arden S.D. Vries R.R.P.d. Hutton J.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 632-634Google Scholar) and were enriched in endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and mitochondria (column 1), high density membranes (column 2), low density membranes (column 3), and secretory granules (column 4). Column 5 contained no protein. Fractions 6-11 were derived from a continuous Percoll gradient (17Hutton J.C. Penn E.J. Peshavaria M. Diabetologia. 1982; 23: 365-373Google Scholar) and contained cytosolic proteins (column 6), microsomal proteins and ribosomes (column 7), plasma membranes (column 8), mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (column 9), secretory granules (column 10), and secretory granules plus lysososmes (column 11). Clone number 35 was the progenitor clone in the present study, clone number 9 was unidentified, CK8 indicates cytokeratin 8, and CD63 indicates the lysosomal protein of the same name. B, normal rat kidney cells (NRK), mouse glucagonoma (αTC2), rodent insulinoma (βTC3, D11, and G1), and rat phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cell lines were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to generate a particulate (P) and soluble (S) fraction. Samples were treated in an identical manner to the subcellular fractions in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Sequence AnalysisThe cDNA sequence of phogrin (Fig. 2) was deduced from overlapping sequences of the original clone detected with antibodies, pxM35 (nt 1455-2484), and the clones 35/B3 (nt 214-3723) and 35/4 (nt 1-1050), which were obtained by rescreening the cDNA library with oligonucleotide probes derived from pxM35 and 35/B3, respectively. The sequence of 3723 bp incorporated an open reading frame of 3015 bp (nt 86-3100). No poly(A)+ tract or poly(A)+ addition consensus motif was evident, suggesting that it was truncated at the 3′ end. This was consistent with the finding that the endogenous mRNA (5.2 kilobases; see Fig. 4) was clearly larger than the determined sequence. The first AUG codon bore a consensus Kozak motif and was shown to be a functional start site for in vitro translation (see Fig. 8). It was immediately followed by a consensus secretory pathway signal sequence (aa 1-17) consistent with the postulated location of the protein in the insulin secretory granule.Fig. 4Northern blot analysis of tissue distribution. Poly(A)+ mRNA samples (5 µg) from different mouse tissues (A) and a series of rodent cell lines (B) and total RNA from INS-1 cells or 400 rat pancreatic islets (C) were hybridized to a probe derived from nt 444-1241 in the phogrin cDNA sequence (upper panels), washed, and then reprobed with β-actin (lower panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 8In vitro translation of the phogrin cDNA. A, translation of RNA transcripts of the full-length phogrin clone were performed in the presence or the absence of dog pancreatic microsomes as indicated. Treatment with proteinase K was performed on ice after translation in the presence or the absence of detergent to determine the extent of protection afforded by translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Endoglycosidase H treatment was performed on denatured solubilized material after translation. B, the translocated/proteinase K-treated translation product (A, fourth lane) was immunoprecipitated with an NH2-terminally directed or a COOH-terminally directed anti-phogrin antibody or an irrelevant control antibody (carboxypeptidase H) as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The deduced polypeptide sequence of 1004 aa encoded a protein of 111,876 Da of a moderately acidic character (predicted pI 5.66). Four consensus sites for NH2-linked glycosylation were evident (aa 552, 762, 790, and 886), but it is probable that only the first of these is functional in a cellular context (see below). A stretch of 25 hydrophobic amino acids with a predicted α-helical conformation was present in the structure (aa 603-627) and was flanked both NH2- and COOH-terminally by positively charged amino acids consistent with it being a membrane-spanning domain. A consensus sequence for the catalytic site of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (Fig. 3) appeared at aa 931-942 near the COOH terminus of the molecule. The 376-aa segment of the molecule between the putative membrane-spanning domain and the COOH terminus had several potential sites for phosphorylation by casein kinase II ((S/T)XX(D/E)) and protein kinase C ((S/T)X(R/K)), mainly located in a Ser-rich region adjacent to the membrane. A series of potential tyrosine-based (YXX hydrophobic) and dileucine-based sorting motifs were also observed in this region.Fig. 3Alignment of phogrin with rat islet cell antigen IA-2 (ICA512). The transmembrane segment (shaded) and the putative sites of post-translational proteolysis (white) are boxed. Residues that are highly conserved in other PTPs (>90% identity in 38 aligned sequences) are marked (+); differences are shown in the single-letter code.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)EMBL and GenBank™ data base searches revealed homology to a large number of different protein-tyrosine phosphatases over a stretch of approximately 260 residues commencing 100 aa after the transmembrane domain and extending to the COOH terminus. Among more than 250 positively scoring PTP homologues, phogrin showed the closest homology with another pancreatic islet PTP, ICA512 (IA-2) (Fig. 3), a protein of similar size and structure that has been identified as an islet cell antigen reactive to autoimmune sera of diabetic patients (24Rabin D.U. Pleasic S.M. Palmer-Crocker R. Shapiro J.A. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 183-186Google Scholar, 25Lan M.S. Lu J. Goto Y. Notkins A.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 505-514Google Scholar). Alignment of phogrin and IA-2 over their entire lengths (42.0% identity; 57.1% similarity) revealed additional homologies in a short Cys-rich region near the NH2 terminus (Gly36-Lys112; 41.5% identity; 64.9% similarity) and in the region that corresponds approximately to the 60/64-kDa mature protein (Gln415-Gln1003; 64.0% identity; 78.9% similarity). The latter could be further divided into the PTP domain (aa 716-1003; 79.5% identity; 88.1% similarity) and the preceding segment (aa 415-715; 44.1% identity; 66.5% similarity), which incorporates the putative lumenal domain (aa 415-602) of the mature protein, the transmembrane domain (aa 603-627), and a common Ser-rich cytoplasmic region. Data base searches with the NH2-terminal portion of the molecule preceding the PTP domain were not informative. The fibronectin binding motif (Arg-Gly-Asp), which appears in IA-2, a number of other transmembrane PTPs, and several proteins undergoing regulated secretion, was absent in phogrin.Tissue DistributionNorthern blot analysis of a range of mouse tissues using a probe derived from the 5′ end of the molecule (nt 444-1241) revealed a single mRNA of 5.2 kilobases in brain but showed no reactivity with heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, or testis (Fig. 4A).

The nervous tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans neurocan and phosphacan/protein-tyrosine phosphatase-η/β were found to be high-affinity ligands of the neural cell adhesion molecule TAG-1/axonin-1, with dissociation constants of 0.3 nM and 0.04 nM, respectively. Phosphacan binding was decreased by ∼70% following chondroitinase treatment, whereas binding of neurocan was not affected. The contribution of chondroitin sulfate chains to the binding of neurocan and phosphacan to TAG-1/axonin-1 is therefore the opposite of that previously observed for their binding to two other Ig-superfamily neural cell adhesion molecules, Ng-CAM/L1 and N-CAM. Moreover, whereas phosphacan interactions with certain proteins are mediated at least in part by N-linked oligosaccharides on the proteoglycan, N-deglycosylation of phosphacan had no effect on its binding to TAG-1/axonin-1. In addition to the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans described above, we have demonstrated that N-CAM is a high-affinity ligand of TAG-1/axonin-1 (Kd∼1 nM), and specific binding of TAG-1/axonin-1 to tenascin-C was also observed (Kd∼9 nM). Immunocytochemical studies of embryonic and early postnatal nervous tissue showed an overlapping localization of TAG-1/axonin-1 with all four of these ligands, further supporting the biological significance of their ability to interact in vitro.

These studies also demonstrated their binding to neurons and that they are potent inhibitors of neuronal and glial adhesion and of neurite growth. Neurocan is synthesized by neurons (5Engel M. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 366: 34-43Google Scholar) and is a member of the family of multidomain hyaluronan-binding chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that also includes aggrecan, versican, and brevican (6Rauch U.

Both neurocan and phosphacan undergo extensive developmental changes in concentration, molecular size, glycosylation, sulfation, and immunocytochemical localization (14Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A.

It would appear that through their association with cells and with neural cell adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins, these proteoglycans play an important role in modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during nervous tissue histogenesis. Because this is a complex process that undoubtedly depends on the relative levels and locations of a variety of cell surface and extracellular matrix proteins at different developmental stages, we have searched for other ligands of neurocan and phosphacan and have identified the neural cell adhesion molecule TAG-1/axonin-1, which we found to also be a high-affinity ligand for N-CAM. receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase bovine serum albumin. The gene product termed TAG-1 in the rat and axonin-1 in the chicken belongs to a group of nervous tissue glycoproteins of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. It is present predominantly on the axons of specific nerve fiber tracts that have a restricted distribution pattern during neural development, and TAG-1/axonin-1 can serve as a substrate for neurite outgrowth (for references, see 18Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 963-1108Google Scholar). The Ig superfamily of cell adhesion molecules can be subdivided into several subgroups (18Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 963-1108Google Scholar, 19Cunningham B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 628-633Google Scholar), one of which comprises proteins having six Ig-like domains and four fibronectin type III repeats, but that lack a transmembrane region and may be attached to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. In terms of sequence homology, this group can be further divided into several subclasses (20Yoshihara Y. Kawasaki M. Tamada A. Nagata S. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 28: 51-69Google Scholar). The TAG-1/axonin-1 subclass, whose members have been shown to occur in both soluble and membrane-bound forms, includes chicken axonin-1 (21Zuellig R.A. Rader C. Schroeder A. Kalousek M.B. von Bohlen Halbach F. Osterwalder T. Inan C. Stoeckli E.T. Affolter H.-U. Fritz A. Hafen E. Sonderegger P. Eur. J.

In the present study we have identified TAG-1/axonin-1 as an additional ligand for neurocan and phosphacan and found that its interactions involve different types of proteoglycan glycosylation from those previously shown to affect the binding of these proteoglycans to Ng-CAM/L1, N-CAM, and tenascin-C. Our studies have also demonstrated that N-CAM is a high-affinity ligand for TAG-1/axonin-1, and that all of the proteins that we have shown to interact in vitro have overlapping localizations in nervous tissue. Neurocan, phosphacan, and phosphacan-KS (previously designated the 1D1, 3F8, and 3H1 proteoglycans, respectively) were isolated from rat brain by ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and immunoaffinity chromatography (14Rauch U.

Because these code for amino acids in the C-terminal portion of the central nonhomologous domain of neurocan, this antiserum would not be expected to recognize other members of the family of hyaluronan-binding chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (i.e. aggrecan, versican, and brevican), and immunoblots of rat brain chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans demonstrated reactivity only with full-length neurocan and its previously described proteolytic processing products (14Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Google Scholar, 15Meyer-Puttlitz B. Milev P. Junker E. Zimmer I. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2327-2337Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed as described previously (4Milev P. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Grumet M. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1703-1715Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were coated in removable Immulon-4 wells using a concentration of 1–2 µg/ml for binding of proteoglycans to axonin-1, Ng-CAM and N-CAM, and 10 µg/ml when testing the binding of axonin-1 to various proteins. Binding of labeled protein was measured in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3 containing 1 mg/ml heat-treated BSA and either 50 or 150 mM NaCl, following incubation with gentle shaking (45 rpm) for 3–4 h at room temperature. Scatchard plots were generated and dissociation constants were determined using the Macintosh version of the Ligand program (28Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar). Proteins were labeled to a specific activity of 1018-1019 cpm/mol with 125I by the lactoperoxidase/glucose oxidase method using Enzymobeads (Bio-Rad). Typically, 10–25 µg of protein were labeled per reaction, and free iodine was removed using a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Labeled proteins were eluted in 30 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaI, and 8 mg/ml heat-treated BSA. Enzyme digestions were typically performed using 20–40-µl aliquots of 125I-labeled proteins in BSA-containing elution buffer (2–10 × 106 cpm, 200–400 ng of labeled protein) in 45–120-µl reaction volumes. Digestions with protease-free chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) were performed for 2 h at 37°C in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 30 mM sodium acetate at an enzyme concentration of 500 milliunits/ml. For removal of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, proteins were treated for 6 h at 37°C with recombinant peptide N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) at a concentration of 12 units/ml in 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Digestions with Bacteroides fragilis endo-β-galactosidase (Oxford Glycosystems) to remove keratan sulfate were performed in 30 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH 5.9, for 6 h at 37°C at an enzyme concentration of 45 mU/ml, and digestions with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (Boehringer Mannheim) were performed for 2 h at 37°C in 30 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 4 mM CaCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and an enzyme concentration of 150 milliunits/ml. Immunocytochemistry of Vibratome sections of perfusion-fixed postnatal rat brain using peroxidase-conjugated second antibody was performed as described previously (14Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Google Scholar). Localization of proteins in embryos was performed by double immunofluorescence of cryostat sections (16Meyer-Puttlitz B. Junker E. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 366: 44-54Google Scholar) using the 3.1C12 monoclonal antibody to TAG-1 and polyclonal antibodies to neurocan, phosphacan, N-CAM, and tenascin-C, in conjunction with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). There was significant binding of neurocan and phosphacan to axonin-1 isolated from either brain membranes or vitreous fluid, and phosphacan binding to TAG-1/axonin-1 was decreased by ∼70% following chondroitinase treatment, whereas the binding of neurocan was not affected (Fig. 1). The contribution of chondroitin sulfate chains to the binding of neurocan and phosphacan to TAG-1/axonin-1 is therefore the opposite of that observed for their binding to Ng-CAM/L1 and N-CAM, in which neurocan binding was decreased significantly following chondroitinase treatment whereas this had only a slight effect on the binding or biological effects of phosphacan (2Friedlander D. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Google Scholar, 4Milev P. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Grumet M. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1703-1715Google Scholar). These results suggest that for neurocan and phosphacan, which share at least three neural cell adhesion molecule ligands, glycosylation provides an important means for regulating their specific interactions. It is also of interest that whereas ionic strength has a significant effect on the binding of neurocan and phosphacan to Ng-CAM/L1 and N-CAM (2Friedlander D. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Google Scholar, 4Milev P. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Grumet M. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1703-1715Google Scholar), binding of both neurocan and phosphacan to vitreous TAG-1/axonin-1 and of phosphacan to membrane TAG-1/axonin-1 was only slightly greater in 50 mM NaCl (data not shown) as compared to binding in 150 mM NaCl (Fig. 1). The specificity and affinity of the proteoglycan-TAG-1/axonin-1 interactions were also studied. Binding of neurocan and phosphacan was found to be saturable, reversible, and of high affinity, with dissociation constants of 0.3 nM and 0.04 nM, respectively (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Phosphacan binding to TAG-1/axonin-1 was almost completely inhibited by neurocan, phosphacan, and the phosphacan core glycoprotein, to the extent of ∼80% by chondroitinase-treated neurocan, and little or not at all by chondroitin sulfate and fibronectin (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the TAG-1/axonin-1 binding sites for neurocan and phosphacan may be relatively close to one another and are similar to those from earlier studies in which we have found reciprocal inhibition of neurocan and phosphacan binding to Ng-CAM/L1 and N-CAM by the proteoglycans or the phosphacan core glycoprotein. 2P. Milev and R. U. Margolis, unpublished results. We previously reported that the interactions of phosphacan (but not neurocan) with Ng-CAM/L1, N-CAM, and tenascin-C are mediated by N-linked oligosaccharides on phosphacan (29Milev P. Meyer-Puttlitz B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24650-24653Google Scholar). However, binding of phosphacan to TAG-1/axonin-1 was not affected by peptide N-glycosidase treatment to remove N-linked oligosaccharides (data not shown), which is consistent with evidence described above that the chondroitin sulfate chains play an important role in this process. To determine whether TAG-1/axonin-1 and the proteoglycans are present together at the same sites and developmental periods, which is a necessary requirement for their molecular interactions to be biologically meaningful, we performed immunocytochemical studies on their localization in the embryonic and early postnatal rat central nervous system. Double immunofluorescence studies showed a colocalization of TAG-1 and phosphacan in the dorsal root entry zone of the spinal cord, the trigeminal ganglion, and the cortex at embryonic day 13 (E13), and in the cortex, lateral olfactory tract, optic nerve, and retina at E16 (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). There was also colocalization of TAG-1 and neurocan in the dorsal root ganglion and entry zone, optic nerve, and retina at E13-16 (Fig. 7), and an overlapping staining pattern for TAG-1, neurocan, and phosphacan was seen in postnatal day 7 rat cerebellum (Fig. 8). These results demonstrate that there are many sites at which TAG-1/axonin-1 and the proteoglycans have the opportunity to interact during central nervous system development, although the distribution of TAG-1/axonin-1 is considerably more restricted than that of other neural cell adhesion molecule ligands of neurocan and phosphacan such as Ng-CAM/L1 and N-CAM. A glycosylation variant of phosphacan (designated phosphacan-KS) contains keratan sulfate in addition to chondroitin sulfate chains. Four different forms of phosphacan-KS have been isolated based on their relative affinities for the 3H1 monoclonal antibody to the keratan sulfate chains and partly reflecting developmental changes in glycosylation (7Maurel P. Rauch U. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2512-2516Google Scholar, 14Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Google Scholar). We therefore compared the binding of these four populations of phosphacan-KS to TAG-1/axonin-1, Ng-CAM/L1, N-CAM, and tenascin-C. There was binding of all forms of phosphacan-KS, but only the 0.5 M NaCl eluate from 7-day brain showed a significantly greater degree of binding to these ligands (data not shown). Endo-β-galactosidase treatment had no effect on the binding of phosphacan-KS, indicating that the keratan sulfate chains do not play a significant role in this process, and neuraminidase treatment of either the proteoglycans, neural cell adhesion molecules, or tenascin-C also had little or no effect on their ability to interact. However, as expected from the results previously obtained with phosphacan itself (29Milev P. Meyer-Puttlitz B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24650-24653Google Scholar), peptide N-glycosidase treatment of phosphacan-KS significantly decreased its binding to Ng-CAM, N-CAM, and tenascin-C (data not shown). We can therefore conclude from these data that N-linked oligosaccharides play a major role in the binding of phosphacan and phosphacan-KS to Ng-CAM/L1, N-CAM, and tenascin-C, whereas the presence of chondroitin sulfate is important for interactions of these proteoglycans with TAG-1/axonin-1, and that sialic acid and keratan sulfate do not appear to have a significant role. Because relatively little was known concerning the differences between the molecular forms of phosphacan-KS, we also examined the electrophoretic pattern of their 125I-labeled core glycoproteins. After treatment with chondroitinase and endo-β-galactosidase to remove both the chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains, one obtains varying proportions of two core glycoproteins with apparent molecular sizes on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 315 and 380 kDa. When the four different preparations of phosphacan-KS were tested for binding to previously identified ligands of phosphacan, it was found in each case that only the 380-kDa component bound to axonin-1 and tenascin-C, whereas both the 315- and 380-kDa components bound to Ng-CAM/L1 and N-CAM, demonstrating an additional level at which the binding of phosphacan may be modulated by glycosylation. We also investigated the binding of TAG-1/axonin-1 to itself and to other potential ligands. Although some (but not all) previous studies have demonstrated homophilic binding of TAG-1/axonin-1 and heterophilic interactions with Ng-CAM/L1 and Nr-CAM (24Hasler T.H. Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Zuellig R.A. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 329-339Google Scholar, 25Sakurai T. Shiga T. Shirai T. Tanaka H. Grumet M. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 83: 99-108Google Scholar, 30Kuhn T.B. Stoeckli E.T. Condrau M.A. Rathjen F.G. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1113-1126Google Scholar, 31Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Osterwalder T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Google Scholar, 32Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Google Scholar, 33Suter D.M. Pollerberg G.E. Buchstaller A. Giger R.J. Dreyer W.J. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1067-1081Google Scholar), because of the different types of assays used it is not possible to make quantitative comparisons of binding to different ligands. Using a radioligand assay, we detected only a relatively low degree (3–4%) of homophilic binding of TAG-1/axonin-1 or heterophilic binding to Ng-CAM/L1 and Nr-CAM (Fig. 9). These values are nevertheless significant insofar as they exceeded background binding to BSA by 4- to 10-fold. Unexpectedly, we found much greater binding to several previously unreported ligands for TAG-1/axonin-1 including N-CAM (11%), tenascin-C (10%), laminin (12%), and collagens I and II (8–15%), whereas there was no significant binding to a number of other cell surface or extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, vitronectin, merosin, collagens III and V, and epidermal growth factor or fibroblast growth factor-2 receptors (Fig. 9). These values all refer to the binding of vitreous fluid TAG-1/axonin-1 in 150 mM NaCl. Brain membrane TAG-1/axonin-1 gave a similar binding profile but a slightly lower percent binding (data not shown). The binding to N-CAM was of high affinity (Kd∼1 nM), saturable, and reversible (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10). There was also saturable and reversible binding of 125I-axonin-1 to immobilized tenascin-C with a calculated Kd of ∼0.3 nM (data not shown), but because binding, although reversible, was surprisingly not inhibited by even relatively high concentrations of unlabeled axonin-1, this value cannot be considered as reliable. However, binding of 125I-tenascin-C to axonin-1 was saturable, reversible, and inhibitable, but indicated a lower affinity with a Kd of ∼9 nM (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10). Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated an overlapping localization of TAG-1 with N-CAM in the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion, optic chiasm (Fig. 11), and retina, and there are areas in the developing brain (e.g. the lateral olfactory tract of E16 cortex) in which we observed a colocalization of TAG-1 and tenascin-C (not shown). Binding of axonin-1 to laminin and certain collagens was also observed (Fig. 9). In further studies of the interactions with laminin, it was found that, as described above for tenascin-C, binding of 125I-axonin-1 was not inhibited by unlabeled ligand in 50 mM NaCl (and was not tested in 150 mM NaCl, in which binding decreases by 65–70%). Because laminin and collagen are very minor and transient components of central nervous tissue parenchyma and because the colocalization of laminin with TAG-1 could not be demonstrated in preliminary immunocytochemical studies, we did not investigate the specificity and affinity of these interactions in greater detail. However, it is possible that they are functionally significant in the peripheral nervous system. The interactions between proteoglycans, neural cell adhesion molecules, and tenascin-C, and the differences in the binding affinities of these complexes, suggest that an important role of neurocan and phosphacan may be to competitively inhibit cell interactions with neural cell adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins. We have previously demonstrated that neurocan and phosphacan inhibit homophilic interactions of Ng-CAM and N-CAM (34Grumet M. Flaccus A. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 815-824Google Scholar). These inhibitory effects may be mediated by competition for the same receptors on the basis of affinity or, because neurocan and phosphacan are large bulky molecules, they may also function by binding to receptors that are not in close proximity to the actual sites that mediate homophilic or heterophilic binding. In view of the newly identified axonin-1/N-CAM interaction described above, we studied the effects of neurocan, phosphacan, and other soluble molecules on the binding of labeled axonin-1 to immobilized N-CAM (Fig. 12) and found that their relative inhibitory potencies were in good agreement with their binding affinities for axonin-1 and N-CAM (i.e. phosphacan > neurocan > axonin-1 > tenascin-C > fibronectin and vitronectin). There was also a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of neurocan and phosphacan on the binding of labeled axonin-1 to tenascin-C (IC50 for phosphacan = 42 nM, and 41% inhibition by neurocan was observed at 57 nM, which was the highest concentration tested). The higher concentrations of neurocan and phosphacan required for inhibition of axonin-1 binding to tenascin-C are consistent with the lower affinity of both proteoglycans for tenascin-C. We have previously described the interactions of neurocan and phosphacan/RPTPη/β, which are major chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that are specific to nervous tissue (1Margolis R.K. Rauch U. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar), with two neural cell adhesion molecules (Ng-CAM/L1 and N-CAM) and the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C, whereas there was no significant binding to a large number of other potential ligands that were tested (2Friedlander D. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Google Scholar, 3Grumet M. Milev P. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Bourdon M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12142-12146Google Scholar, 4Milev P. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Grumet M. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1703-1715Google Scholar). Here we have presented evidence for the overlapping localization and specific, high-affinity binding of neurocan and phosphacan/RPTPη/β to TAG-1/axonin-1, another Ig-superfamily cell adhesion molecule, and for the interaction of TAG-1/axonin-1 with N-CAM and tenascin-C. Although TAG-1/axonin-1 is the third neural cell adhesion molecule that has been identified as a ligand for neurocan and phosphacan, these interactions are apparently mediated by different molecular mechanisms, insofar as phosphacan binding to TAG-1/axonin-1 (but not to Ng-CAM/L1 or N-CAM), and neurocan binding to both Ng-CAM/L1 and N-CAM (but not to TAG-1/axonin-1) is greatly decreased by the enzymatic removal of their chondroitin sulfate chains (Fig. 1 and 2Friedlander D. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Google Scholar and 4Milev P. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Grumet M. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1703-1715Google Scholar). Moreover, interactions of phosphacan (but not neurocan) with Ng-CAM/L1 and N-CAM have been shown to be mediated by N-linked oligosaccharides (29Milev P. Meyer-Puttlitz B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24650-24653Google Scholar), whereas N-deglycosylation has no effect on its interactions with TAG-1/axonin-1. These differential effects of glycans on the interactions of neurocan and phosphacan with neural cell adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins are summarized in Fig. 13. A recombinant Fc-fusion protein representing the N-terminal carbonic anhydrase-like domain of phosphacan/RPTPη/β has also been reported to bind to contactin but not to Ng-CAM/L1, N-CAM, or tenascin-C (13Peles E. Nativ M. Campbell P.L. Sakurai T. Martinez R. Lev S. Clary D.O. Schilling J. Barnea G. Plowman G.D. Grumet M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1995; 82: 251-260Google Scholar). Since a tryptic glycopeptide derived from the carbonic anhydrase domain of phosphacan binds to these latter ligands by a mechanism dependent on its N-glycosylation (29Milev P. Meyer-Puttlitz B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24650-24653Google Scholar), the interaction of phosphacan with contactin is also likely to involve different structural features. Moreover, previous studies demonstrated that neither proteoglycan bound to two other Ig-superfamily neural cell adhesion molecules, the myelin-associated glycoprotein (2Friedlander D. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Google Scholar, 4Milev P. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Grumet M. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1703-1715Google Scholar) and neurotrimin (35Struyk A.F. Canoll P.D. Wolfgang M.J. Rosen C.L. D'Eustachio P. Salzer J.L. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2141-2156Google Scholar). 3P. Milev and R. U. Margolis, unpublished results. It may be significant in this connection that neither the myelin-associated glycoprotein nor neurotrimin contain fibronectin type III repeats, which are present in all of the identified ligands of neurocan and phosphacan. Our preliminary survey of the interactions of TAG-1/axonin-1 with itself and with other potential ligands using a solid-phase binding assay yielded several interesting results, which are summarized in Fig. 14. Although in previous studies only weak homophilic binding was detected using axonin-1 bound to Covaspheres (25Sakurai T. Shiga T. Shirai T. Tanaka H. Grumet M. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 83: 99-108Google Scholar), binding could be demonstrated following heterologous expression of chicken axonin-1 or its human homologue TAX-1 on the surface of transfected myeloma cells (24Hasler T.H. Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Zuellig R.A. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 329-339Google Scholar, 31Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Osterwalder T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Google Scholar). Microbeads coated with TAG-1 also bound homophilically to TAG-1 immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane (32Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Google Scholar). With regard to heterophilic interactions, Kuhn et al. (30Kuhn T.B. Stoeckli E.T. Condrau M.A. Rathjen F.G. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1113-1126Google Scholar) showed that axonin-1 binds to Ng-CAM using a microbead coaggregation assay, whereas Felsenfeld et al. (32Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Google Scholar) did not detect any heterophilic binding of TAG-1 to either L1/Ng-CAM or N-CAM using an assay involving the aggregation of transfected Drosophila S2 cells. However, they did obtain some indirect evidence for interactions between TAG-1 and L1/Ng-CAM, insofar as antibodies to L1 (but not to N-CAM) inhibited neurite outgrowth on a TAG-1 (but not on a laminin) substrate, and they noted that their negative results do not preclude interactions of TAG-1 with L1 or N-CAM if the binding affinities are below the detection threshold of the S2 cell aggregation assay. Suter et al. (33Suter D.M. Pollerberg G.E. Buchstaller A. Giger R.J. Dreyer W.J. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1067-1081Google Scholar) have also recently reported the binding of axonin-1 to Nr-CAM based on a Covasphere aggregation assay. It is difficult to directly compare these previous results with those from our radioligand binding assays, which may be both more sensitive and also allow a better quantitation of the extent and specificity of binding. However, our studies suggest that the interactions of TAG-1/axonin-1 with itself and with Ng-CAM or Nr-CAM may be relatively minor in quantitative (but not necessarily in functional) terms, whereas N-CAM may represent an equally or more important ligand. Binding of tenascin-C to TAG-1/axonin-1 was quantitatively significant (Fig. 9), saturable, and reversible, with a Kd of ∼9 nM (Fig. 10), and there is an overlapping localization of TAG-1/axonin-1 and tenascin-C in the developing central nervous system (data not shown). Although the affinity is approximately one-third of that previously found for the binding of tenascin-C to neurocan and phosphacan (3Grumet M. Milev P. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Bourdon M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12142-12146Google Scholar) and several orders of magnitude lower than that for the proteoglycan interactions with neural cell adhesion molecules (2Friedlander D. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Google Scholar, 4Milev P. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Grumet M. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1703-1715Google Scholar), the basic conditions are present for TAG-1/axonin-1 interactions with tenascin-C to play a functional role during nervous tissue histogenesis. The saturation experiments in which we studied the binding of labeled axonin-1 to N-CAM involve two molecules that self-aggregate. Self-aggregation of ligand, leading to dimer or multimer formation, may alter the ligand conformation in such a way as to reduce affinity for the receptor, as has been postulated for insulin dimers and higher aggregates (36Cuatrecasas P. Hollenberg M.D. Adv. Protein Chem. 1976; 30: 252-450Google Scholar). It is also possible that aggregate formation may occlude binding sites on the ligand and/or receptor, thus resulting in lower apparent affinity. On the other hand, our measurements may overestimate the affinity of a monomeric axonin-1/N-CAM interaction because a multimeric aggregate may bind with a high overall avidity. For example, in the interaction of the immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules CD2 and CD48, a Kd of 60–90 µM was measured with monomeric CD48 ligand compared to a Kd of 1 µM obtained with a preparation of CD48 containing multimeric aggregates (37van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Google Scholar), and similar results were obtained from studies on monomeric or multimeric LFA-3 binding to cell surface CD2 (38Dustin M.L. Olive D. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 503-517Google Scholar). Factors such as these may explain why labeled axonin-1 bound to tenascin in a saturable but noninhibitable manner with a Kd of 0.3 nM (probably based on avidity), whereas labeled tenascin (which does not self-aggregate) bound to axonin-1 with a Kd of 9 nM (affinity). These considerations do not, however, minimize the significance of the saturable binding of axonin-1 to N-CAM. Even if the calculated Kd of 1 nM is an overestimate based on avidity binding, such a value may be highly relevant to the in vivo situation in which aggregates of these proteins may be formed on membranes, thus allowing tight binding on the basis of avidity. In studies of reconstituted vesicles composed of N-CAM and brain membrane lipids (39Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5762-5766Google Scholar), the markedly nonlinear aggregation rate observed with respect to N-CAM concentration in the lipid bilayer may be due to a cis-interaction of N-CAM (i.e. on the plane of one membrane), and a cis-binding of axonin-1 on membranes has been suggested on the basis of its homophilic interaction (31Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Osterwalder T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Google Scholar). Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins such as TAG-1/axonin-1 have an approximately 10-fold higher lateral membrane mobility compared to transmembrane proteins, and this higher mobility has been shown to enhance cell adhesion both by accumulation of CAM at the cell contact area and by increasing the rate of receptor-ligand bond formation (40Chan P.-Y. Lawrence M.B. Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Golan D.E. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 245-255Google Scholar). The affinities for interactions between immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules measured by radioligand or other assays are generally quite low (in the micromolar and even submillimolar range; 37van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Google Scholar and 41van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 354-358Google Scholar). These lower affinities are thought to provide a mechanism for de-adhesion when transient interactions are required and for stable adhesion (based on high multimer avidity) such as that involved in fascicle formation. It is likely that neurocan and phosphacan, which bind to Nr-CAM, 4L. Karthikeyan, P. Milev, and R. U. Margolis, unpublished results. Ng-CAM/L1, N-CAM, and TAG-1/axonin-1, as well as to tenascin-C which interacts with TAG-1/axonin-1, may all affect transient and stable adhesions during development and plasticity based on a complex interplay of binding affinities, avidity modulation, and formation of complexes. To our knowledge, the only reported dissociation constant for homophilic or heterophilic binding between immunoglobulin superfamily neural cell adhesion molecules is for the homophilic interaction of rat N-CAM, for which Moran and Bock (42Moran N. Bock E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 121-124Google Scholar) determined a Kd of 1.23 × 10−6M for polysialylated newborn rat brain N-CAM and 6.9 × 10−8M for adult N-CAM using a solid-phase radioligand assay. Although their data may not be directly comparable with ours, the Kd for the interaction of TAG-1/axonin-1 with embryonic (polysialic acid-rich) N-CAM is 3 orders of magnitude lower than that for N-CAM homophilic interactions. If these in vitro data reflect the situation in vivo, the N-CAM/axonin-1 interaction may be preferred over homophilic N-CAM interactions. This may also be important for axonal path finding, by analogy with the results of a recent study that demonstrated that antibodies to axonin-1 or Nr-CAM injected in ovo prevented commissural axons from crossing the midline (43Stoeckli E.T. Landmesser L.T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1165-1179Google Scholar). Numerous in vitro studies and antibody perturbation experiments have demonstrated that TAG-1/axonin-1 is an excellent substrate for neurite growth and is involved in nerve fasciculation (30Kuhn T.B. Stoeckli E.T. Condrau M.A. Rathjen F.G. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1113-1126Google Scholar, 32Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Google Scholar, 33Suter D.M. Pollerberg G.E. Buchstaller A. Giger R.J. Dreyer W.J. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1067-1081Google Scholar, 44Ruegg M.A. Stoeckli E.T.

These studies point to the importance of both homophilic and heterophilic interactions of TAG-1/axonin-1 in neural morphogenetic events and to the complexity of these processes, which may involve associations between several different neural cell adhesion molecules. Because neurocan and phosphacan/RPTPη/β have been shown to be high-affinity ligands for many of these proteins, they may prevent, modulate, or possibly even enhance adhesive processes (e.g. soluble TAG-1/axonin-1 bound to proteoglycans may no longer be capable of inhibiting fasciculation). Proteoglycans may also affect the formation of protein complexes on the plane of the same membrane or serve as guidance cues on the basis of local gradients or complexes with other molecules. In the latter case, the relative abundance of the proteoglycans and their ligands could facilitate or inhibit the formation of higher order complexes which may direct or modulate neurite growth and fascicle formation."

INTRODUCTIONThe integrin family of cell surface adhesion receptors plays a critical role in cell to extracellular matrix interactions and in the formation and maintenance of an organized cytoskeleton (1Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Google Scholar, 3Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev.

In addition, it has become clear that integrins are also signal-transducing receptors (6Rosales C. O'Brien V. Kornberg L. Juliano R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 77-98Google Scholar) that regulate cell growth and survival (7Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1993; 262: 1572-1575Google Scholar, 8Frisch S.M. Francis H.

Chen A. Cone R.I. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 547-556Google Scholar). In many cell types, clustering of integrins leads to activation and autophosphorylation of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase termed pp125FAK, and the recruitment of this protein to focal adhesion complexes (19Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23439-23442Google Scholar, 20Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, FAK 1The abbreviations used are: FAKfocal adhesion kinaseMAPmitogen-activated proteinMAPKKMAP kinase kinaseMAPKKKMAP kinase kinase kinaseBSAcrystalline, lipid-free, bovine serum albuminEGFepidermal growth factorFnfibronectinDMEMDulbecco's minimal essential mediumK−MAPKkinase-dead MAP kinaseMEKMAP or extracellular signal-related kinase kinase. activation may be a key primary event for integrin signal transduction processes.An important issue is whether the signaling events triggered by integrins involve components used by better known signal transduction cascades, such as receptor tyrosine kinase pathways which feature a key role for the Ras proto-oncogene (22Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Science. 1993; 365: 781-783Google Scholar, 23Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Cell. 1993; 74: 215-217Google Scholar, 24Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Google Scholar). Recent evidence has suggested that there may be substantial overlap between the integrin signaling pathway and the Ras consensus cascade. Thus, integrin-mediated activation of FAK leads to the creation of phosphotyrosine binding sites for SH2 domain proteins, including Grb2 (25Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (26Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Google Scholar), and Src family kinases (27Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Google Scholar), that have been implicated in aspects of the Ras cascade. Further, integrin-mediated cell adhesion has been shown to strongly activate MAP kinase, a key downstream effector of the Ras signaling pathway (25Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Google Scholar, 28Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar, 29Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Google Scholar). A number of proteins involved in the Ras signal transduction path have been observed to congregate in proximity to integrins at focal adhesion sites (30Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O. Silvio G. Burbelo P. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Google Scholar). Finally, in lymphoid cells, there is evidence that anti-integrin antibodies can cause GTP loading of Ras (31Kapron-Bras C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Jeevaratnam P. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20701-20704Google Scholar). However, despite these intriguing correlations, the signaling pathway from integrins to activation of MAP kinases has yet to be clearly delineated. In this report we demonstrate that integrin-mediated adhesion of mouse fibroblasts leads to activation of the major kinases of the Ras cascade, including Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase. The activation of MAP kinase caused by integrin ligation is dependent upon activation of MEK. However, integrin-mediated activation of MEK, and subsequently of MAP kinase, seems to occur by a pathway that is largely independent of Ras.RESULTSThis investigation was designed to compare integrin-mediated signaling with the better known signal transduction pathway triggered through receptor tyrosine kinases and to evaluate the role of Ras in the integrin pathway. Integrin-dependent adhesion of suspended NIH 3T3 cells to a fibronectin-coated substratum led to rapid and robust tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK, but not of the 185-kDa EGF receptor (Fig. 1, A and C). Conversely, treatment of adherent 3T3 cells with EGF caused activation and autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor, but only slightly enhanced the high basal level of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation typical of attached cells (Fig. 1, B and D). Treatment of suspension cells with EGF strongly activated the EGF receptor, but had no effect on FAK (Fig. 1, B and D). The overall patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation in lysates of cells stimulated by integrin ligation or by peptide growth factors also showed marked differences between the two situations (38Kornberg L.J. Earp S.E. Turner C.E. Procktop C. Juliano R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8392-8396Google Scholar). 2T. H. Lin and R. L. Juliano, unpublished observations. Thus, as expected, cell adhesion and growth factor stimulation triggered distinct initial tyrosine phosphorylation events, with EGF primarily activating its cognate receptor and integrin-mediated cell adhesion primarily activating FAK.The cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases Raf-1 (a MAPKKK) and MAP kinase, as well as the dual-function kinase MEK (a MAPKK), were each strongly activated by either integrin-mediated attachment of suspended NIH 3T3 cells to fibronectin or by treatment of adherent cells with EGF (Fig. 2A). The increase in kinase activities over basal levels was usually somewhat higher for maximally effective (100 ng/ml) concentrations of EGF than for coating concentrations of fibronectin (25 µg/ml) that were maximally effective in promoting adhesion. Both the 42-kDa and 44-kDa forms of MAP kinase were activated by either EGF stimulation or integrin-mediated adhesion (28Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar).2 The kinetics of integrin activation of Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase were essentially the same, with maximal activation within 10 min of the beginning of the adhesion process and then a gradual decline over a period of 1 to 2 h. (Fig. 2B). This is similar to previously reported kinetics for adhesion-induced MAP kinase activation in Swiss 3T3 cells (28Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar). To confirm that the observed effect on MAP kinase was specifically due to integrins, we examined kinase activity in 3T3 cells transfected with a chicken β1 integrin subunit and adhering to surfaces coated with an anti-chicken β1 monoclonal antibody or to surfaces coated with an antibody to CD44, an abundant non-integrin cell surface protein (39Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Google Scholar); adhesion to fibronectin was used as a positive control. As seen in Fig. 2C, specific adhesion mediated by the β1 integrin, but not by CD44, led to a robust activation of MAP kinase, as detected by a band shift assay.Fig. 2Integrin-specific adhesion of NIH 3T3 cells activates Raf-1, MEK, and MAPK. Serum-starved cells were placed in suspension and then allowed to attach to fibronectin-coated substrata as in the legend of Fig. 1. Adherent serum-starved cells were treated with EGF (100 ng/ml). In A, Raf-1, MEK, and MAPK activities were measured by immunocomplex kinase assays from same cell lysates. Following separation of the appropriate substrates, K−MAPK (for Raf-1 assays or MEK assays) or MBP (for MAPK assays), by SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. The substrate bands were also excised from the gels and counted by scintillation counting (not shown). B shows the parallel time courses of Raf-1, MEK, and MAPK activation induced by cell adhesion. In C, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with a chicken β1 subunit. The transfected serum-starved cells were placed in suspension and then allowed to attach to surfaces coated with anti-chicken β1 antibody W1B10, with fibronectin, or with antibody to CD44 (Serotec USA, Washington, D. C.) as a control. Equal numbers of cells were firmly attached in each case. MAPK activation was examined using a band shift assay, as described (28Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We wished to ascertain possible cause and effect relationships between the proteins activated by integrin engagement and to determine whether those relationships were the same as for the consensus Ras cascade activated by receptor tyrosine kinases. To do this, we used pharmacological or molecular tools to selectively inhibit upstream events and then examined the downstream consequences. Thus, a recently described selective inhibitor of MEK (PD98059) (40Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Google Scholar) allowed us to demonstrate that integrin-mediated MAP kinase activation is blocked when MEK activation is inhibited (Fig. 3). This anticipated result confirms that this segment of the signaling cascades for receptor tyrosine kinases and for integrins are similar.Fig. 3Integrin-mediated MAPK activation is dependent on MEK activation. Suspended NIH 3T3 cells were treated with 30 µM concentration of the selective MEK inhibitor PD98059 for 45 min, then cells were harvested immediately (Sus) or allowed to attach to a fibronectin-coated substratum for 10 min (Fn). Cell lysates were prepared and MEK and MAPK activities were determined as described in the legend of Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We looked for evidence of Ras activation in the integrin pathway by determining if a transient increase in active Ras GTP occurs in stimulated cells, using a well-established assay for this purpose (41Vaillancourt R.R. Harwood A.E. Winitz S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 255-258Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4, transfection of cells with oncogenic (61L) Ras, or stimulation of cells with EGF, resulted in clear and substantial increases in GTP loading of Ras. However, integrin-mediated cell adhesion did not produce a significant increase in GTP loading of Ras over control levels. Thus, EGF stimulation increased Ras GTP loading by a factor of 3.1 ± 1.3 over control, while adhesion to fibronectin increased Ras GTP loading by a factor of only 1.3 ± 0.5 over control; the difference between the EGF and adhesion effects was significant at the p < 0.01 level. This suggested that Ras was not strongly activated in response to integrin ligation. These experiments cannot rule out the possibility of small increases in Ras GTP loading as a result of cell adhesion; however, minor changes may not be important in signaling to downstream effectors.Fig. 4Integrin-mediated cell adhesion does not significantly change Ras GTP/GDP ratios. Serum-starved, 32P-labeled, NIH 3T3 cells were placed in suspension and then allowed to attach to a fibronectin-coated substrate as described in the legend of Fig. 1; alternatively, serum-starved adherent cells were treated with EGF. Serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells transiently expressing constitutively activated Ras (61L) were also used as another positive control. Ras GTP/GDP ratios were measured as described (41Vaillancourt R.R. Harwood A.E. Winitz S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 255-258Google Scholar). Results are presented as the fold increase in GTP/GDP ratios compared to unstimulated control which is taken as 1.0. Data are means ± S.D. of six experiments performed in duplicate. The p values from Student's t-test for each stimulation with respect to its own control are as follows: p > 0.1 for +Fn; p < 0.005 for +EGF; p < 0.001 for Ras (61L).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further investigate the role of Ras in integrin signaling, we used a transient co-transfection assay that allowed measurement of MEK activation in the presence or absence of dominant inhibitors of the Ras pathway. As a positive control, we examined the effect of these dominant inhibitors on activation of MEK by oncogenic forms of Ras or Sos-1, proteins which clearly are integral components of the Ras cascade. We chose to use co-transfection with oncogenic Ras or Sos, rather than EGF stimulation, since the EGF receptor can trigger both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent activation of MAP kinase in fibroblasts (42Burgering B.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Medema R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7248-7256Google Scholar). Ras-independent activation of Raf and of MAP kinases by tyrosine kinases has also been observed in other mammalian cell types (43Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Google Scholar, 44Pickett C.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6777-6784Google Scholar) and in Drosophila (45Hou X.S. Chou T.-B. Cell. 1995; 81: 63-71Google Scholar).NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with an epitope-tagged MEK construct (EE-MEK) whose expressed protein could be immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells and tested for its ability to phosphorylate a mutated, inactive form of MAP kinase. These cells were also co-transfected with constructs expressing a dominant interfering mutant of Raf-1 or with a control vector lacking this insert. The Raf 23-284 mutant contains the amino-terminal Ras-binding sequence of Raf, but lacks the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (34Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Google Scholar). Therefore, it blocks Ras function by forming an inactive complex with endogenous Ras (34Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Google Scholar, 46Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Google Scholar, 47Schapp D. van der Wal J.

Co-expression of Raf 23-284 did not affect the robust activation of EE-MEK caused by integrin-mediated adhesion of 3T3 cells (Fig. 5A). However, co-expression of Raf 23-284 very effectively inhibited activation of EE-MEK caused by simultaneous transfection with a construct expressing a constitutively activated Ras (12V) mutant (Fig. 5B). These results strongly suggest that integrin-mediated activation of MEK, and subsequent activation of MAP kinase in 3T3 cells, are largely independent of Ras activation.Fig. 5Dominant-negative constructs that block Ras signaling do not affect integrin-mediated MEK activation. In A, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently co-transfected using LipofectAMINE with 0.4 µg of pCMV EE-MEK and 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 µg of pCGNraf 23-284 (total amount DNA was supplemented with pCGN empty vector to 2 µg for each 35-mm tissue culture dish). Transfected cells were placed in suspension and then allowed to attach to a fibronectin-coated substratum as described in the legend of Fig. 1. EE-MEK was immunoprecipitated with an anti-polyEE monoclonal antibody, and EE-MEK activity was monitored by its ability to phosphorylate K−MAPK. B shows a positive control in which NIH 3T3 cells were transiently cotransfected with 0.4 µg of EE-MEK and 0.1 µg of pZIPras (12V) and with 0.1 µg of pCGNraf 23-284 or pCGN empty vector (total DNA was supplemented with SP70 DNA to 2 µg/35-mm dish). pCGNraf 23-284 is also known as pCGNraf N4 (34Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Google Scholar). In C, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently co-transfected with 0.2 µg of EE-MEK construct and 1.8 µg of a construct (pZIPras (17N)) encoding the Ras (17N) dominant-negative protein, or with empty pZIP vector. The cells were allowed to attach to Fn for 10 min. In D, 3T3 cells were co-transfected with 0.2 µg of EE-MEK, 0.2 µg of 5′-Sos F construct expressing the activated form of Sos-1, or with 0.2 µg of vector (a negative control), and 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 µg of pZIPras (17N) (total DNA was supplemented with pZIP vector to 2.0 µg). EE-MEK activities were determined as described above. The lower inset in each set of panels shows EE-MEK expression levels measured by Western blot with a polyclonal antibody against MEK1 and −2 in the same cell lysates as for the kinase assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further rule out the involvement of Ras in integrin signaling, 3T3 cells were co-transfected with the EE-MEK construct and with a construct expressing a mutated form of Ras (Ras 17N) that can act in a dominant-negative manner by blocking guanine nucleotide exchange factors involved in the activation of endogenous Ras (24Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Google Scholar, 35Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5C, transfection with the Ras (17N) construct had no effect on the activation of EE-MEK caused by cell adhesion to fibronectin. However, transfection with the Ras (17N) construct strongly inhibited the activation of EE-MEK caused by expression of a membrane-targeted form (5′-Sos F) of the Sos-1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras (Fig. 5D). Once again, this suggests that integrin-mediated MEK activation does not involve Ras.DISCUSSIONTreatment of NIH 3T3 cells with peptide mitogens such as EGF, or ligation of integrins, both lead to activation of tyrosine kinases; however, the patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation observed are quite different. EGF activates its cognate tyrosine kinase receptor which is then strongly autophosphorylated; other proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated as well, but there is only a very modest effect on pp125FAK. Conversely, integrin-mediated adhesion of 3T3 cells causes a pronounced activation and autophosphorylation of the pp125FAK tyrosine kinase, without affecting EGF receptor. Although the initial patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation are quite different, both EGF treatment and integrin ligation lead to the activation of several cytoplasmic kinases known to be important in signal transduction, including Raf, MEK, and MAP kinases. While FAK activation seems to parallel the activation of Raf-1, MEK, and MAP kinase, there is no direct evidence that FAK is responsible for activation of these downstream kinases.We have shown that integrin-mediated activation of MAP kinase depends on prior activation of MEK. Thus, as expected, these kinases stand in the same relationship to each other in the integrin signaling pathway as in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. The role of Raf in integrin-mediated activation of MAP kinases is less clear. Although most models suggest that Raf-1 is upstream of MEK and responsible for its activation (24Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Google Scholar), other reports suggest that 3T3 cells contain several MAPKKKs capable of activating MEK1 and −2 (49Reuter C.W.M. Catling A.D. Jelinek T. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7644-7655Google Scholar). Thus, although Raf-1 can be activated subsequent to integrin-mediated adhesion, its role in propagation of signals to MAP kinases in this pathway is uncertain at this point.Several recent observations have suggested that integrin signals might intersect with the Ras signal transduction cascade. Thus, integrin-mediated activation and autophosphorylation of FAK leads to the binding of Grb2-Sos complexes which might then serve to activate the Ras cascade (25Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Google Scholar). Further, both peptide mitogens and integrin ligation are capable of activating MAP kinases and the nuclear Jun kinase (28Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar, 30Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O. Silvio G. Burbelo P. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Google Scholar), both known downstream elements of the Ras cascade. Despite these presumed similarities, our current data strongly suggest that integrin signaling to MAP kinases in 3T3 cells is largely independent of Ras. Both GTP loading experiments, as well as use of dominant-negative inhibitors, failed to support a major role for Ras in integrin-mediated activation of MEK. The observation that expression of the dominant-negative Raf 23-284 and Ras 17N constructs, at levels which could significantly inhibit signaling events triggered by bona fide components of the Ras pathway, failed to have any effect on integrin signaling to MEK, strongly suggests that Ras is not the major contributor to this pathway. The fact that Grb2 binds to FAK (25Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Google Scholar) suggests that integrin signaling may project through the Ras pathway to some degree. However, our current observations strongly indicate the existence of Ras-independent events that link integrins to MAP kinase activation. Thus, the integrin signal transduction cascade clearly differs from the consensus Ras signaling pathway.There are several possibilities for Ras-independent pathways of integrin signaling. One is that another small G-protein might substitute for Ras. Cdc42 and Rac, members of the Rho subfamily of low molecular weight G-proteins, have been implicated in activation of the Jun-kinase pathway (50Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar). However, although Cdc42 and Rac are usually thought to be downstream of Ras, they only weakly activate MAP kinases (51Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Google Scholar). Rho has been implicated in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate production, and possibly through this mechanism, in the regulation of actin filament assembly (52Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether these events impact upon MAP kinase activation. Another possibility is that integrin ligation modulates a kinase activity that directly impinges on Raf (or another MAPKKK) without the agency of a G-protein. A similar situation seems to prevail in TNF-mediated signaling, where activation of the Jun kinase pathway occurs in a Ras-independent fashion (53Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1722Google Scholar), presumably via lipid-activated kinases (54Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that several laboratories have identified proteins that interact directly with integrin cytoplasmic domains. These include a novel serine/threonine kinase (termed ILK) that binds to β1 or β3 cytoplasmic domains (55Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Google Scholar), and a novel small protein (termed endonectin) that binds selectively to β3 cytoplasmic domains (56Shattil S.J. O'Toole T. Eigenthaler M. Thon V. Williams M. Babior B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 807-816Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine whether ILK, endonectin, or other proteins that bind to integrins, might play a direct role in the integrin-mediated activation of MAP kinases. INTRODUCTIONThe integrin family of cell surface adhesion receptors plays a critical role in cell to extracellular matrix interactions and in the formation and maintenance of an organized cytoskeleton (1Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Google Scholar, 3Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev.

In addition, it has become clear that integrins are also signal-transducing receptors (6Rosales C. O'Brien V. Kornberg L. Juliano R.L. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2014465321,"Many events in apoptosis have been identified but their temporal relationships remain obscure. Apoptosis in human ML-1 cells induced by etoposide is characterized by intracellular acidification, enhanced Hoechst 33342 fluorescence, DNA digestion, chromatin condensation, and proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. This proteolysis is a marker for the action of ICE/CED-3 proteases, which are critical activators of apoptosis. We observed that three serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid, calyculin A, and cantharidin, prevented all of these apoptotic characteristics. To determine which protein phosphatase was involved, we investigated the dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility protein Rb, a substrate for protein phosphatase 1 but not protein phosphatase 2A. Rb was dephosphorylated during apoptosis, and each inhibitor prevented this dephosphorylation at the same concentrations that prevented apoptosis. No increase in protein phosphatase 1 activity was observed in apoptotic cells suggesting that dephosphorylation of Rb may result from loss of Rb kinase activity in the presence of a constant level of protein phosphatase activity. Long term inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 (>8 h) also led to the appearance of dephosphorylated Rb, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and apoptosis, suggesting these events are not solely dependent upon protein phosphatase 1. Rb dephosphorylation was also observed in several other models of apoptosis.

Maintaining tissue and organ homeostasis requires a delicate balance between the rate of cell division and the rate of cell death. Cells that are either metabolically compromised or no longer required are eliminated by a pathway commonly known as apoptosis. This process has been characterized by cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic blebbing, chromosome condensation, DNA digestion, and, finally, non-inflammatory removal of the cell from the tissue (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Google Scholar). Apoptosis occurs during development, immune regulation, and normal cell turnover, as well as being induced by many pharmacological insults. Decreased apoptosis can lead to cancer and autoimmune diseases, while increased apoptosis can result in neurodegenerative disorders and AIDS (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Google Scholar). Despite the importance of apoptosis, the signal transduction pathways responsible for the associated morphological and biochemical changes are poorly understood. Much recent emphasis has focused on the identification of proteases of the ICE/CED-3 family that appear essential to this pathway (3Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Google Scholar, 4Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Google Scholar, 5Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Google Scholar), but both the upstream and downstream events remain elusive. While investigating endonucleases that might be involved in apoptosis, we detected and purified deoxyribonuclease II (DNase II), an endonuclease that is active at slightly acidic pH but inactive at pH 7.0 (6Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Google Scholar). To determine whether DNase II might be responsible for the DNA digestion, we measured intracellular pH in various cell models during apoptosis. In each model tested, the apoptotic cells were seen as a distinct population with an acidic shift of 0.5-0.8 pH units (7Barry M.A. Eastman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 782-789Google Scholar, 8Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357Google Scholar, 9Morana S. Li J. Springer E.W. Eastman A. Int. J.

Cell Res. 1996; 225 (in press)Google Scholar). Recently, other laboratories have confirmed that intracellular acidification occurs during apoptosis (12Perez-Sala D. Collado-Escobar D. Mollinedo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6235-6242Google Scholar, 13Rebello A. Gomez J. de Aragon A.M. Lastres P. Silva A. Perez-Sala D. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 581-585Google Scholar). Hence, intracellular acidification appears to represent a common event in the pathway of apoptotic cell death. Although intracellular acidification can activate DNase II (6Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Google Scholar), we have recently established that a low intracellular pH is not required for DNA digestion, suggesting that an additional means of activating DNase II can occur, or that an alternate endonuclease may be involved. Specifically, when CTLL-2 cells were maintained at an extracellular pH of 8.0, DNA digestion and apoptosis still occurred upon removal of interleukin 2, but the intracellular pH only dropped to 7.2, a pH at which DNase II should be inactive (10Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Google Scholar). Hence, during apoptosis, cells always appear to undergo intracellular acidification, but the low pH that results is not required for the activation of an endonuclease. These observations suggest that both intracellular acidification and DNA digestion are regulated by a common upstream regulator. This paper presents the results of a search for such a regulator. The intracellular acidification that occurs during apoptosis results from selective loss of pH regulation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the acidification that occurs in apoptotic CTLL-2 cells results from an alteration in the set point of the Na+/H+-antiport (10Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Google Scholar). Normally, the Na+/H+-antiport raises the intracellular pH to around neutrality. Although apoptotic CTLL-2 cells still retained functional antiport, it was only able to raise intracellular pH to around 6.3 in apoptotic cells. The set-point of the Na+/H+-antiport has been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation (14Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Google Scholar, 15Sardet C. Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1990; 247: 723-726Google Scholar, 16Schwartz M.A. Lechene C. Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7849-7853Google Scholar). A wide variety of external signals, including growth factors and the extracellular matrix, activate a kinase cascade that leads to phosphorylation of the antiport and intracellular alkalization. These same stimuli are also known to enhance cell survival. Many intracellular signaling components, such as protein kinase C and Ha-Ras, also lead to enhanced survival and activation of the antiport (17Swann K. Whitaker M. Nature. 1985; 314: 274-277Google Scholar, 18Maly K. Uberall F. Loferer H. Doppler W. Oberhuber H. Groner B. Grunicke H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11839-11842Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid has been shown to activate the antiport (19Bianchini L. Woodside M. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Takai A. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15406-15413Google Scholar). These observations all support the notion that protein kinase cascades protect cells through pathways that also regulate intracellular pH. Accordingly, we have investigated the role of protein phosphatases as potential mediators of intracellular acidification and apoptosis. Previous results have suggested that the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A can prevent the onset of apoptosis (20Song Q. Baxter G.D. Kovacs E.M. Findik D. Lavin M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 550-556Google Scholar, 21Song Q. Lavin M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 47-55Google Scholar). Those results are confirmed and extended here. We demonstrate that apoptosis, as assessed by DNA digestion, intracellular acidification, changes in membrane permeability, and morphology, can be prevented by a number of protein phosphatase inhibitors.

Dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility protein Rb was also associated with the onset of apoptosis, and this was inhibited by the same concentrations of each inhibitor that were effective at blocking apoptosis. The dephosphorylation of Rb is normally mediated by protein phosphatase PP1 at the onset of mitosis (22Ludlow J.W. Glendening C.L. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell.

ML-1 myeloid leukemia cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. All cultures were maintained in logarithmic growth at a density <1 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were incubated with etoposide for 30 min after which they were centrifuged, washed twice, and resuspended in completed medium without drug. The phosphatase inhibitors were added only for the incubation period following removal of etoposide. In most experiments, cells were harvested and analyzed 4 h after removal of etoposide. DNA digestion was measured by agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (6Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Google Scholar, 24Eastman A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 41-55Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were added directly to the wells of a 2% agarose gel, where they were lysed and digested with ribonuclease A and proteinase K. The gel was electrophoresed for 16 h, and the DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light. In this method, high molecular weight DNA (>20 kilobase pairs) remains trapped in or near the well, while smaller fragments (down to 180 base pairs) are resolved in the gel. Chromatin condensation in apoptotic cells was assessed by staining with acridine orange, while membrane integrity was measured simultaneously by exclusion of ethidium bromide (25Duke R.C. Cohen J.J. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 3.17.1Google Scholar). A 25-µl aliquot of cells in medium was stained by addition of 1 µl of a stock solution of 100 µg/ml acridine orange plus 100 µg/ml ethidium bromide in phosphate-buffered saline. A minimum of 200 cells were scored under a fluorescence microscope for apoptotic morphology. For analysis of Rb and PP1, 105 cells were lysed in 100 µl of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol. For analysis of Rb, 20 µl of this total cell lysate was electrophoresed in a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (MiniPROTEAN II; Bio-Rad). The proteins were electroblotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Marlborough, MA), blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, and probed with anti-Rb monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1/1,000. The secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse at a dilution of 1:2,000 (Bio-Rad). Alternately, an anti-Rb polyclonal antibody was used at 1:100 dilution with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted 1:3,000. Immunoreactivity was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Corp.). For analysis of PP1, a 10-µl aliquot of the cell lysate was electrophoresed in a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, probed with an anti-PP1 rabbit polyclonal antibody diluted 1/3,000, and then with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) at a dilution of 1:2,000. For analysis of PARP, 106 cells were lysed by sonication on ice in 100 µl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4 M urea, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS). 40 µl of this lysate was electrophoresed on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electroblotted to membranes and blocked in TBSTM (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were probed with an anti-PARP mouse monoclonal antibody (C-2-10) diluted 1:10,000 in TBSTM. The secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse at a dilution of 1:3,000, followed by ECL. For the measurement of intracellular pH, cells were loaded for 1 h with 1 µM carboxy-SNARF-1 acetoxymethyl ester, and analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan Plus flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm and emission measured at 585 and 640 nm (8Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357Google Scholar, 24Eastman A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 41-55Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37°C in complete medium including bicarbonate during analysis. The pH measurements were obtained by ratioing the fluorescence emissions at the two appropriate wavelengths, and comparing to a pH calibration curve. Apoptotic cells were also detected by staining with Hoechst 33342. This dye is thought to preferentially stain apoptotic cells due to very early changes in membrane permeability (26Ormerod M.G. Sun X.-M. Snowden R.T. Davies R. Fearnhead H. Cohen G.M. Cytometry. 1993; 14: 595-602Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 1 µg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 5 min and analyzed on the flow cytometer with excitation at 355 nm and emission measured at 440 nm. In the experiments shown here, cells were stained with carboxy-SNARF-1 for 55 min, followed by the addition of Hoechst 33342 for 5 min prior to simultaneous analysis of the fluorescence of both dyes. Cell cycle analysis was performed on cells that had been fixed in ethanol and stained with propidium iodide as described previously (27Sorenson C.M. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4484-4488Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells were separated from normal cells by their increase in buoyant density. Cells (5 × 106) were suspended in 4 ml of completed culture medium plus 4 ml of a Percoll solution (9 volumes of Percoll plus 1 volume of 10 × minimal essential medium) and 0.1% Pluronic F68 surfactant to limit cell adhesion to the centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 30 min at 36°C, a continuous gradient of Percoll with banded cells was obtained. The gradients were fractionated from the top with a pipette, and the cells were collected by diluting with medium and recentrifuging. Protein phosphatase PP1 and PP2A activity were analyzed with the Protein Phosphatase Assay System (Life Technologies, Inc.), which utilizes 32P-labeled phosphorylase A as a specific substrate for PP1 and PP2A in vitro (28Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Google Scholar). Phosphorylase B is converted to phosphorylase A by coincubation of kinase/substrate solution with phosphorylation reaction buffer and 0.5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (30°C for 1 h), followed by protein concentration via ammonium sulfate precipitation and centrifugation. ML-1 cell lysates were prepared and assayed according to an adaptation of the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and 105 cells were lysed in 100 µl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 µg/ml leupeptin, and 25 µg/ml aprotinin. PP1 and PP2A activity in the cell extracts were immediately assayed by combining 20 µl of cell lysate, 20 µl of protein phosphatase assay buffer, and 20 µl of [32P]phosphorylase A solution, followed by incubation at 30°C for 10 min. The solubilized 32P was separated from residual phosphorylase A as well as cellular proteins by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, followed by centrifugation. Soluble 32P was then quantified by scintillation counting. PP1 activity was defined as the phosphatase activity inhibited by addition of 1.25 µg/ml inhibitor-2 peptide, and PP2A activity was defined as the activity inhibited by 2 nM okadaic acid. The sum of these two activities was close to 100% of the total phosphatase activity. Many lymphoid cell lines undergo DNA digestion and apoptosis rapidly following a variety of insults. We have previously shown that HL-60 and ML-1 cells show chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and intracellular acidification within 4 h of incubation with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide (8Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357Google Scholar, 9Morana S. Li J. Springer E.W. Eastman A. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 153-158Google Scholar). In the current experiments, we have further defined the etoposide concentration and kinetics required to induce apoptosis in ML-1 cells. In each experiment, cells were incubated with etoposide for 30 min; the drug was then removed so that the induction of apoptosis would occur subsequent to the primary insult rather than under conditions of increasing etoposide-mediated damage. ML-1 cells were incubated with 0-80 µg/ml etoposide for 30 min, followed by removal of drug and incubation for an additional 4 h. DNA fragmentation was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). Control cells showed only high molecular weight DNA in or near the well of the gel, whereas damaged cells showed a dose-dependent formation of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. A concentration of 20 µg/ml showed extensive internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The kinetics of DNA fragmentation were determined following incubation of cells with 20 µg/ml etoposide (Fig. 1B). At the time of removal of etoposide (30 min), there was an increase in high molecular weight DNA fragments migrating about 1 cm into the gel. These fragments result from the cleavable complexes formed by etoposide and topoisomerase II, but disappear rapidly upon removal of the drug. The majority of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation appeared 3-4 h after removal of etoposide. For HL-60 cells, we previously showed that the cells most susceptible to apoptosis were those in S phase at the time of incubation with etoposide; the remaining cells eventually progressed to, and arrested in, the G2 phase of the cell cycle before undergoing apoptosis (8Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357Google Scholar). Similar experiments in ML-1 cells also showed that the S phase cells were most susceptible (shown below with regard to Fig. 8), but the remaining surviving cells stayed arrested in the G1 phase (data not shown). This is consistent with the ML-1 cells expressing the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor protein, in contrast to HL-60 cells. Hence, the apoptosis observed in this paper is independent of p53 status, although expression of p53 does contribute to cell cycle perturbations in the surviving cells. To determine the number of cells undergoing apoptosis at each time or drug concentration, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for increased fluorescent staining with Hoechst 33342. A number of reports have shown that apoptotic cells accumulate Hoechst 33342 at an increased rate, and this can be assessed by a short incubation (<5 min) with the dye (10Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Google Scholar, 26Ormerod M.G. Sun X.-M. Snowden R.T. Davies R. Fearnhead H. Cohen G.M. Cytometry. 1993; 14: 595-602Google Scholar, 29Dive C. Gregory C.D. Phipps D.J. Evans D.L. Milner A.E. Wyllie A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1133: 275-285Google Scholar). Simultaneously, cells were analyzed for intracellular pH with the pH-sensitive fluorescent ratio dye carboxy-SNARF-1. The results are visualized as a scatter plot in which Hoechst fluorescence is shown on the ordinate and intracellular pH (expressed as the emission ratio of 545/640 nm) is shown on the abscissa (Fig. 2). Interestingly, we have found that these two fluorescent dyes detect exactly the same population of cells and, as a result, the combination of dyes helps to discriminate otherwise overlapping populations (10Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Google Scholar). The normal cells appear in the lower left quadrant and the majority of apoptotic cells in the upper right quadrant; the number of apoptotic cells is recorded in each panel. The number of apoptotic cells increases from about 2% at 5 µg/ml etoposide to almost 80% at 80 µg/ml. With respect to kinetics following incubation with 20 µg/ml etoposide, the number of apoptotic cells increases rapidly between 3 and 4 h after treatment in concert with the time of appearance of DNA digestion. The flow cytometry analysis was performed while the extracellular pH was maintained at 7.1, leading to an intracellular pH of 7.15 in the normal cells and 6.5 in the apoptotic cells. Cells were also stained with acridine orange and scored under a microscope for chromatin condensation and alterations in nuclear morphology that occur during apoptosis (25Duke R.C. Cohen J.J. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 3.17.1Google Scholar). Control samples consistently showed less than 5% apoptotic cells, whereas 4 h after incubation with etoposide, 30-41% of the cells exhibited apoptotic morphology. These values are of a similar order as the results obtained by flow cytometry. In two other models, we have previously sorted cells by flow cytometry on the basis of intracellular pH and established that only the acidic cells exhibit these morphological changes (8Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357Google Scholar, 10Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Google Scholar). The current experiments further confirm that enhanced Hoechst fluorescence and intracellular acidification are valid markers of apoptosis. In all subsequent experiments, apoptosis was induced with 20 µg/ml etoposide, with DNA fragmentation and other parameters of apoptosis measured after an additional 4-h incubation. The serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid has been shown to activate the Na+/H+-antiport involved in intracellular pH regulation (19Bianchini L. Woodside M. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Takai A. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15406-15413Google Scholar). Okadaic acid, as well as another serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A, have also been reported to inhibit apoptosis (20Song Q. Baxter G.D. Kovacs E.M. Findik D. Lavin M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 550-556Google Scholar, 21Song Q. Lavin M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 47-55Google Scholar). Hence, we investigated the effect of these inhibitors on DNA fragmentation in our model of apoptosis. ML-1 cells were induced to undergo apoptosis with etoposide, and each inhibitor was then added at various concentrations during the subsequent incubation. We found that 1 µM okadaic acid and 10 nM calyculin A were the minimum concentrations required to markedly inhibit DNA digestion (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). We also investigated the effect of another protein phosphatase inhibitor, cantharidin, on DNA fragmentation; this inhibitor was found to prevent DNA fragmentation at 20-30 µM (Fig. 5).Fig. 4Calyculin A prevents DNA fragmentation, PARP cleavage, and dephosphorylation of Rb. The experimental protocol was identical to Fig. 3, with the exception that the cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of calyculin A rather than okadaic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Cantharidin prevents DNA fragmentation, PARP cleavage, and dephosphorylation of Rb. The experimental protocol was identical to Fig. 3, with the exception that the cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of cantharidin rather than okadaic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we investigated the effect of each inhibitor on the increased Hoechst fluorescence and intracellular acidification that occurs during apoptosis (Fig. 6). Incubation of cells with 1 µM okadaic acid for 4 h neither enhanced Hoechst fluorescence nor caused intracellular acidification. However, when added to cells following incubation with etoposide, 1 µM okadaic acid completely prevented both enhanced Hoechst fluorescence and intracellular acidification. Incubation with 0.1 µM okadaic acid was unable to prevent acidification or increased Hoechst fluorescence consistent with its inability to inhibit DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3). Results obtained with calyculin A and cantharidin were slightly different from okadaic acid in that each inhibitor alone induced a slight acidic shift (Fig. 6). The intracellular acidification induced by calyculin A (mean pHi = 6.8) was more marked than for cantharidin (pHi = 6.9), but in neither case was it as dramatic as in apoptotic cells (pHi = 6.5), and neither inhibitor enhanced Hoechst fluorescence. However, the concentration of each inhibitor that prevented etoposide-induced DNA digestion (Fig. 4, Fig. 5) was still able to prevent the etoposide-mediated increase in Hoechst fluorescence and intracellular acidification. A lower concentration of either inhibitor was ineffective at preventing the etoposide-induced changes. The morphological changes detectable by staining with acridine orange were also investigated for each of these conditions. Etoposide treatment alone induced chromatin condensation in 30-41% of the cells, whereas the addition of either okadaic acid, calyculin A, or cantharidin to etoposide-treated cells reduced this value to 12.6, 7.0, or 5.0%, respectively (average of three separate experiments). Hence, all three inhibitors were able to prevent apoptosis as assessed by chromatin condensation, increased Hoechst fluorescence, and intracellular acidification, and this protection occurred at the same concentrations that also prevented DNA fragmentation. Considering the recent reports that demonstrate a role for ICE/CED-3 proteases in apoptosis, we investigated whether the inhibitors used here functioned at a step upstream or downstream of this protease. PARP has been shown to be proteolytically cleaved from a 116-kDa protein to a 85-kDa fragment by ICE/CED-3 proteases (30Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar). Most recently, this cleavage has been associated with the CPP32/Yama/apopain homolog of this protease family (5Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S.

Transient expression of activated Gα12 increased the percentage of Ras in the active, GTP-bound state, stimulated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, and enhanced the transcriptional activity of c-Jun.

In contrast, dominant negative Rac (N17Rac1) inhibited JNK activation by Gα12 in HEK293 cells as well as three other cell lines. In 1321N1 cells, where thrombin stimulates G12-dependent mitogenesis, coexpression of N17Rac1 or a dominant negative mutant of MEKK1 (MEKKΔ(K432M)) inhibits c-Jun/AP-1 sensitive reporter gene expression stimulated by thrombin or Gα12.

To study the role of O-sulfation in greater detail, we isolated a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant defective in 2-O-sulfation of iduronic acid. The mutant, pgsF-17, was identified by a colony blotting assay in which colonies of mutagen-treated cells were replica plated to two disks of polyester cloth. One disk was blotted with 125I-labeled basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to measure binding to cell surface proteoglycans. The other disk was incubated with 35SO4 to measure proteoglycan biosynthesis. Autoradiography revealed a colony that did not bind 125I-bFGF, but incorporated 35SO4 normally (mutant pgsF-17). Complete deaminative cleavage of heparan sulfate revealed that material from pgsF-17 lacked IdUA(2OSO3)-GlcNSO3 and IdUA(2OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6OSO3), but contained a higher proportion of glucuronic acid GlcUA-GlcNSO3(6OSO3) and IdUA-GlcNSO3(6OSO3).

It is the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1The abbreviations used are: SODsuperoxide dismutaseTaps[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid. that appears to be responsible for protection of these organelles from oxidative damage by catalyzing the decay of the superoxide radical anion. 2O2⋅¯+2H+→O2+H2O2(Eq. 1) superoxide dismutase [2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid. Three forms of SOD have different catalytic metal ions and different distributions (Beyer et al., 4Beyer W. Imlay J. Fridovich I. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 221-253Google Scholar; Tainer et al., 18Tainer J.A. Roberts V.A. Fisher C.L. Hallewell R.A. Getzoff E.D. Kuby S.A. A Study of Enzymes II: Mechanism of Enzyme Action. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 499Google Scholar); it is the manganese SOD that is found in mitochondria and prokaryotes, FeSOD is found in prokaryotes, and Cu,ZnSOD occurs primarily in eukaryotes but has been found in some bacteria. The crystal structure of human MnSOD has been determined at 2.2 Å resolution (Borgstahl et al., 5Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Google Scholar). It shows the active sites grouped in pairs across the dimer interfaces, imposing a trigonal bipyramidal geometry on the manganese (Borgstahl et al., 5Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the MnSOD from Thermus thermophilus at 1.8 Å (Ludwig et al., 10Ludwig M.L. Metzger A.L. Pattridge K.A. Stallings W.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 335-358Google Scholar) and from Bacillus stearothermophilus at 2.4 Å (Parker and Blake, 14Parker M.W. Blake C.C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 649-661Google Scholar) show strong structural similarity with the human enzyme with a similar geometry about the metal. These structures are also similar to that of the FeSOD (Stoddard et al., 17Stoddard B.L. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 113-119Google Scholar) including the same ligands to and geometry about the metal. It is now widely accepted that superoxide dismutases carry out catalysis through a redox process in which the metal cycles between oxidized and reduced states. Mn+3+O2⋅¯+⇄k−1k1[Mn+3−O2⋅¯]→k2Mn+2+O2(Eq. 2) Mn+2+O2⋅¯+⇄k−3k3[Mn+2−O2⋅¯]+2H+→k4Mn+3+H2O2(Eq. 3) Initial studies using pulse radiolysis of the MnSOD from B. stearothermophilusdetermined that its catalysis was complicated by the presence of an inactive form of the enzyme that can interconvert to an active form (McAdam et al., 11McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165 (a): 71-79Google Scholar, 12McAdam M.E. Lavelle F. Fox R.A. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165 (b): 81-87Google Scholar). Steady-state constants for catalysis by MnSOD from T. thermophiluswere obtained by Bull et al.(7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar) from stopped-flow experiments, and the rapid emergence of the inactive form of the enzyme was quantitated. Bull et al.(7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar) were able to observe the inactive form spectrophotometrically and suggested that it results from oxidative addition of O2to the Mn(II) form of the enzyme, resulting in a side-on complex of Mn(III) and peroxide, Mn(III)O−22. We have overexpressed human MnSOD in Escherichia coli and purified this enzyme to homogeneity. Observation of the catalysis by pulse radiolysis for [O2]/[Eo] > 10 showed an initial burst of activity followed by the rapid emergence of an inhibited form of greatly reduced overall catalytic rate. The emergence of inhibition with human MnSOD is sufficiently rapid that the initial burst of catalysis by uninhibited enzyme is over in 1 or 2 ms and hence not able to be observed by our stopped-flow instrumentation. In this aspect, catalysis by human MnSOD is qualitatively similar to that observed previously for MnSOD from B. stearothermophilus (McAdam et al., 11McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165 (a): 71-79Google Scholar, 12McAdam M.E. Lavelle F. Fox R.A. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165 (b): 81-87Google Scholar) and T. thermophilus (Bull et al., 7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar). However, the emergence of the inhibited form is approximately 30-fold more rapid in the human MnSOD than in that of T. thermophilus (Bull et al., 7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar). The rate of catalysis by human MnSOD in the zero-order inhibited region was unaffected by changing the concentrations of several buffers and did not vary over the pH range 8.5-10.5. However, we observed a significant solvent hydrogen isotope effect on the zero-order inhibited region, suggesting that proton transfer steps are rate-contributing in the interconversion of active and inactive enzyme. The oligonucleotides GCATATGAAGCACAGCCTCC containing a NdeI restriction site and GGAGATCTCAGCATAACGATC containing a BglII site were used as primers for polymerase chain reaction to amplify the human MnSOD cDNA (cDNA sequence reported by Beck et al., 2Beck Y. Oren R. Amit B. Levanon A. Gorecki M. Hartman J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9076Google Scholar). The plasmid pHMNSOD4 (ATCC 59947), which contains human MnSOD, was subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites in the expression vector pET31F+ (Tanhauser et al., 19Tanhauser S.M. Jewell D.A. Tu C.K. Silverman D.N. Laipis P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 113-117Google Scholar). This construct expressed human MnSOD in E. coli (strain BL21(DE3)[pLysS]) as a mature protein tagged with an extra Met at the amino terminus. Culture conditions were as described by Tanhauser et al. (19Tanhauser S.M. Jewell D.A. Tu C.K. Silverman D.N. Laipis P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 113-117Google Scholar) without zinc but with additional supplementation by 5 mM MnCl2. Yields of MnSOD were as large as 20% of total cell protein present after induction. We compared the total SOD activity in these cells with the SOD activity in an equal number of cells expressing carbonic anhydrase using this same expression vector as described by Tanhauser et al. (19Tanhauser S.M. Jewell D.A. Tu C.K. Silverman D.N. Laipis P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 113-117Google Scholar). The activity of endogenous superoxide dismutase in the cells expressing carbonic anhydrase was less than 1% of that in the cells overexpressing MnSOD. Human MnSOD was purified from E. coli using a combination of heat treatment (60°C) and ion exchange chromatography (DE52 and CM52) according to the procedures of Beck et al. (3Beck Y. Bartfeld D. Yavin Z. Levanon A. Gorecki M. Hartman J.R. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 930-935Google Scholar). The purity of the resulting samples of human MnSOD were determined on SDS-polyacrylamide gels that showed one intense band. The absorption maximum of the purified protein at 480 nm with a shoulder near 600 nm was in agreement with published spectra (Beck et al., 3Beck Y. Bartfeld D. Yavin Z. Levanon A. Gorecki M. Hartman J.R. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 930-935Google Scholar). The purified sample was dialyzed extensively against EDTA, and the resulting protein was digested with nitric acid for manganese analysis using atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer 5100PC). From this measurement the molar extinction coefficient at 480 nm and pH 7.8 was determined to be 525 M−1 cm−1 for human Mn(III)SOD, and this was the basis for determination of enzyme concentration. The metal (Mn) to protein ratio for these samples was 0.57 ± 0.06, similar to that found for MnSOD from T. thermophilus (Bull et al., 7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar). This ratio was obtained using atomic absorption spectrometry and protein determination by the Lowry method. The molecular mass of our purified sample determined by sedimentation analysis was 89 kDa, 2M. Bubb and D. D. Kern, unpublished data. confirming earlier experiments that human MnSOD is a homotetramer of 22-kDa subunits (McCord et al., 13McCord J.M. Boyle J.A. Bay E.D. Rizzolo L.J. Salin M.L. Michelson A.M. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. Superoxide and Superoxide Dismutase. Academic Press, London1977: 129Google Scholar). Pulse radiolysis experiments were carried out on the 4-MeV van der Graaff accelerator at the Center for Fast Kinetics Research at the University of Texas at Austin. Superoxide radical anions were generated from oxygen in aqueous solutions containing 10 mM sodium formate as OH· scavenger (Schwarz, 16Schwarz H.A. J. Chem. Educ. 1981; 58: 101-105Google Scholar) and 50 µM EDTA in addition to buffer and enzyme. Decay of O2 was monitored spectrophotometrically at 250 nm (ε = 2000 M−1 cm−1; Rabani and Nielson (15Rabani J. Nielson S.O. J. Phys. Chem. 1969; 73: 3736-3744Google Scholar)) with a path length of 2.5 cm. Progress curves for each set of experimental conditions were accumulated for six to nine experiments and averaged. A mechanical shutter was opened a fraction of a second before irradiation to minimize exposure to ultraviolet radiation. All pulse radiolysis experiments were carried out at 20°C. These experiments are based on the stabilization of superoxide in an aprotic solvent, which is subsequently greatly diluted by an aqueous solution of enzyme in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Solutions of substrate in aprotic solvent were prepared by dissolving KO2 in a mixture (2:1 by volume) of dimethyl sulfoxide and N,N-dimethyl formamide (Aldrich spectrophotometric grade) with substrate solubility enhanced by 18-crown-6 (Valentine and Curtis, 20Valentine J.S. Curtis A.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 224-226Google Scholar). We used a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Kinetic Instruments, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) capable of efficient mixing of this solution with an aqueous solution of enzyme (dead time, approximately 1.5-2.0 ms; observation pathlength, 1 cm). One drive syringe (capacity, 50 µl) contained the aprotic solution of O2; this was diluted 50-fold by the contents of a second syringe (capacity, 2.5 ml) that contained enzyme, EDTA, and buffer. The decay of superoxide was monitored by measurement of its absorption at 250-280 nm. Stopped-flow experiments reported here were carried out at 20 or 4°C. Four or more kinetic traces were averaged to reduce noise. Data were acquired and displayed, and rates were obtained using software developed by Kinetic Instruments, Inc. Measurements of the visible absorption spectrum of MnSOD and its pH titration were carried out on a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer. Catalysis of the decay of O2 by human MnSOD showed a biphasic pattern for [O2]/[Eo] > 10 (Fig. 1) in which an initial first-order decay was quickly followed by an extended region of zero-order disappearance of O2. The initial rapid loss of O2 occurred within the first 2 ms of catalysis (Fig. 1); this was within the dead time of our stopped-flow instrument but was observed using pulse radiolysis. The amplitude of this burst, defined by the vertical arrow of Fig. 2 and representing consumption of O2 during the burst, was a linear function of the enzyme concentration (Fig. 2). The slope of Fig. 2 (approximately 12) demonstrates that superoxide consumed in this initial transient was not stoichiometric with enzyme concentration, indicating multiple catalytic turnovers before the enzyme enters the zero-order phase. The first-order rate constant obtained by a least squares fit of this burst region was also observed to be a linear function of MnSOD concentration (data not shown) and had a dependence on pH shown in Fig. 3. This first-order rate was independent of pyrophosphate concentration (1-50 mM) at pH 9.4.Fig. 2Magnitude of the initial burst of superoxide decay as a function of the concentration of human manganese superoxide dismutase. The vertical arrow on the inset shows the amplitude of the burst as the difference between the O2 concentrations in the catalyzed (b) and uncatalyzed (a) cases at a time after the completion of the burst. Data were obtained by stopped-flow spectrophotometry with solutions containing 0.2 M glycine and 0.2 mM EDTA at pH 9.4 and 4°C. The initial concentration of O2 in each case was 0.24 mM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Rate constants for the first-order (•) and zero-order (□) portions of the decay of superoxide catalyzed by human manganese superoxide dismutase. The rate constants were determined by a least squares fit (Enzfitter, Leatherbarrow, 9Leatherbarrow R.J. Enzfitter: A Nonlinear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC. Elsevier BIOSOFT, Cambridge1987Google Scholar) to data obtained by pulse radiolysis under conditions described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The zero-order rate was only observed at higher substrate concentrations ([O2]/[E0] > 10) using either pulse radiolysis (Fig. 1) or stopped-flow instrumentation. The zero-order rate of decay of O2 in this region was also a linear function of MnSOD concentration (data not shown) and was independent of pH in the region of pH 8.2-10 (Fig. 3). Moreover, at pH 9.4 the zero-order rate was independent of the concentration of several buffers in the range of buffer concentrations 2-100 mM; buffers used were glycine, pyrophosphate, bicarbonate, and Taps (data not shown). A solvent hydrogen isotope effect on these rates catalyzed by human MnSOD was measured at an uncorrected pH meter reading of 9.4 using pulse radiolysis under the conditions of Fig. 1. The ratio of the zero-order rate constant in H2O to that in 99% D2O was 3.1 ± 0.2, a value significantly large enough to indicate involvement of a proton transfer. When measured by stopped-flow at 20°C and pH 9.3 maintained by 50 mM glycine, this ratio for zero-order rate constants was 2.2 ± 0.2; unlike the pulse radiolysis experiments, these stopped-flow data were obtained at high O2 concentrations of 0.2-0.5 mM. For the first-order rate constant, this ratio in H2O to that in 99% D2O was 0.79 ± 0.04 determined by pulse radiolysis under conditions of Fig. 1. The visible absorption spectrum of human Mn(III)SOD has a maximum at 480 nm, as does the enzyme from bacterial sources (Bull et al., 7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar; McAdam et al., 11McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165 (a): 71-79Google Scholar). The titration of this absorbance at 480 nm showed a strong pH dependence (Fig. 4) that could be described by an ionizable group of pKa 9.4 ± 0.1. However, this decrease in absorption at higher pH was an overall bleaching of the spectrum, which maintained its form and maximum at 480 over the range of pH studied, with the exception of a small shift of the maximum to lower wavelengths at pH >10.5 (Fig. 4). We have carried out a kinetic study to determine the catalytic properties of human manganese superoxide dismutase, which we have overexpressed in E. coli. Catalysis of the decay of O2 by human MnSOD showed a biphasic pattern in which an initial first-order decay of O2 was quickly followed by an extended region of a much slower zero-order disappearance of O2. This was observed by pulse radiolysis (Fig. 1) and is consistent with observations of previous kinetic studies of bacterial MnSODs (McAdam et al., 11McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165 (a): 71-79Google Scholar; Bull et al., 7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar). In view of the structural similarities between the human and bacterial MnSOD (Borgstahl et al., 5Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Google Scholar; Ludwig et al., 10Ludwig M.L. Metzger A.L. Pattridge K.A. Stallings W.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 335-358Google Scholar; Parker and Blake, 14Parker M.W. Blake C.C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 649-661Google Scholar), it is not surprising that they appear to have similar catalytic properties with kinetic constants for catalysis by T. thermophilus MnSOD reported by Bull et al. (7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar) and for B. stearothermophilus reported by McAdam et al. (11McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165 (a): 71-79Google Scholar, 12McAdam M.E. Lavelle F. Fox R.A. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165 (b): 81-87Google Scholar. Consequently, our data on human MnSOD are interpreted within the background of much accumulated information on the bacterial manganese-containing SODs that suggest the general basis for the catalytic mechanism based on Equations 2 and 3. In addition, we report new information not previously studied with the bacterial MnSODs, specifically the pH dependences of catalysis and of the visible absorption spectrum, the buffer dependence of catalysis, and the solvent hydrogen isotope effects. Because of these similarities, both structural and kinetic, between the human and T. thermophilus MnSOD, we interpret our kinetic data in terms of the model of Bull et al. (7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar) for the bacterial enzyme. This model is shown in Scheme I and is based on the oxidative and reductive half-cycles of the accepted mechanism of the SODs and includes formation of a dead-end complex (X in Scheme I). Bull et al. (7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar) have spectroscopic evidence for the nature of this inhibited complex and suggest that it is a side-on peroxo complex with manganese(III). Active enzyme is regenerated by dissociation of this complex to the Mn+3 form and free peroxide, as shown in steps 4 and 5 of Scheme I; this regeneration of active enzyme, by this model, is a dominant factor in the zero-order region of the catalysis (Bull et al., 7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar). The kinetic equations describing the mechanism of Scheme I are too complex to solve for a useful expression of the steady-state velocities. We have instead obtained kinetic parameters for this catalysis by fitting the constants of Scheme I to the kinetic data obtained by pulse radiolysis, such as shown in Fig. 1, using KINSIM (Barshop et al., 1Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Google Scholar) and FITSIM (Zimmerle and Frieden, 21Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 381-387Google Scholar). The pulse radiolysis data have the advantage, compared with that from stopped-flow, that they contain information from the initial burst of catalytic activity. The rate constants obtained in this manner are given in Table I, where they are compared with the analogous constants for the bacterial MnSOD obtained by Bull et al. (7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the numerical solution to experimental errors in the slopes of the kinetic plots was determined. An error of ±10% in the slope of the observed zero-order region produced an error of ±12% in the calculated values of the rate constants k5 and k−5. Although these data were obtained at different temperatures, it is apparent that the major difference in the catalytic behavior lies in the steps of the formation of the inhibited complex, step 5. In particular, the rate constant for formation of this complex k5 is 30-fold faster for the human compared with the bacterial MnSOD. This rapid formation of inhibited complex with the human SOD would explain why we have not been able to observe even the tail end of the burst phase with human MnSOD using stopped-flow methods. It also provides a qualitative explanation for the value of 12 for the slope of the burst amplitude versus enzyme concentration in human MnSOD (obtained by stopped-flow at 4°C; Fig. 2); that is, there are several catalytic cycles possible in Scheme I before the enzyme is inhibited in step 5. It is noteworthy that the rate constants for steps of the oxidative and reductive half cycles, steps 1 through 4 of Scheme I, are very similar for the two enzymes (Table I).Table IValues of the rate constants for catalysis by manganese superoxide dismutase obtained by fitting the model of Scheme I to the data of Fig. 1 using KINSIMRate constantHuman MnSOD (pH 9.4at 20°C)T. thermophilus MnSOD (pH 9.3at 2°C)k1 (M−1 s−1)2 ×1091.5 ×109k−1 (s−1)2 ×1043.5 ×104k2 (s−1)8 ×1042.5 ×104k3 (M−1 s−1)2 ×1091.5 ×109k−3 (s−1)2 ×1043.5 ×104k4 (s−1)8 ×1042.5 ×104k−4 (m−1 s−1)3 ×1023.0 ×102k5 (s−1)2 ×104650k−513010k7 (M−1 s−1)2000140[O2]initial (M)5 ×10−61.0 ×10−3[MnSOD]total (M)5 ×10−71.0 ×10−6 Open table in a new tab Using the data of Table I, we are able to obtain values of the steady-state constants in the absence of inhibition by use of the Equations 5 of Bull et al. (7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar). For human MnSOD, based on the data from pulse radiolysis at 20°C and pH 9.4, the turnover number kcat = 4 × 104 s−1 and kcat/Km = 8 × 108M−1 s−1. The resulting value of Km is 50 µM, and thus the pulse radiolysis experiments of Fig. 1 were well below substrate saturation. The observation of the initial burst of catalytic activity with human MnSOD allows us to obtain a value of kcat/Km directly from this initial first-order region of the catalysis, measured by pulse radiolysis in the first 1 ms of reaction; this value is kcat/Km = 2 × 109M−1 s−1, a magnitude suggesting that this catalysis is near diffusion control. The comparable values for T. thermophilus MnSOD at 2°C and pH 9.3 are kcat = 1.3 × 104 s−1 and kcat/Km = 3 × 108M−1 s−1 (Bull et al., 7Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Google Scholar). These values are somewhat smaller than we found for the human enzyme, most likely due to the higher temperature of our experiments with the human enzyme. Hence, we conclude that the human enzyme has inherent catalytic rates very comparable with the MnSOD from T. thermophilus, but the human MnSOD is novel in its greater susceptibility to product inhibition, as described above. The pH dependence of the visible absorption spectrum of human MnSOD at 480 nm (Fig. 4), indicating the presence of an ionizable group, could possibly account for the pH dependence of the first-order kinetic parameters for catalysis (Fig. 3). This change in absorbance at 480 nm did not affect the overall form of the absorption spectrum, which implies that it does not involve a change in the coordination about the metal. A similar bleaching of the spectrum of the FeSOD from E. coli had a pKa near 9, and in this case the kinetic parameter kcat/Km also had a pH dependence described by an apparent pKa near 9 (Bull and Fee, 6Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3295-3304Google Scholar). These pH effects could arise from the ionization of Tyr34, the side chain of which is about 5 Å from the manganese (Borgstahl et al., 5Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Google Scholar), or from other nearby residues. It is this residue that has been suggested as the source of the pKa near 9 for Fe(II)SOD (Lah et al., 8Lah M.S. Dixon M.M. Pattridge K.A. Stallings W.C. Fee J.A. Ludwig M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1646-1660Google Scholar). A role for Tyr34 in human MnSOD is also suggested by the observation that the mutant Y34F human MnSOD has a molar absorptivity ε480 that is independent of pH between 8.5 and 10.5 and is lacking the change in visible absorption observed with the wild type. 3Y. Hsieh, unpublished data. Also the mutant Y34F MnSOD is more susceptible to product inhibition than is the wild type. If proton transfer from Tyr34 allows dissociation of peroxide from the metal, it may be the role of Tyr34 that contributes to the different kinetic properties of the human and bacterial MnSODs. The extended zero-order decay of superoxide apparent in the progress curves for both the bacterial and human MnSODs is dominated by steps 5, governing the formation and dissociation of the inhibited complex. Although this region of the decay is a linear function of enzyme concentration for human MnSOD (Fig. 2), it is not affected by buffer concentrations and is independent of pH making it unaffected by the observed pKa in the visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme observed at 480 nm (Fig. 4). Yet the zero-order rate constant representing in part the regeneration of active enzyme (McAdam et al., 11McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165 (a): 71-79Google Scholar) has a substantial solvent hydrogen isotope effect of 3.1 ± 0.2, indicating involvement of a rate-contributing proton transfer. These results suggest that step 5 is not affected by proton transfer from buffers in solution and occurs independent of the ionization in the active site causing the pKa of 9.4 (Fig. 4); however, it apparently does involve a proton transfer. One possibility is that active enzyme is regenerated by a rate-contributing proton transfer, allowing the dissociation of peroxide or peroxoyl anion from the enzyme, and that this rate-contributing proton transfer is from water or a residue of the enzyme itself. The buffers we have used were not able to activate the catalysis through proton transfer and perhaps are not accessible to the active site. We are pleased to thank Dr. Christopher Bull for helpful discussions, David Kern for assistance with the data of Fig. 4, and Billy K. Naumann for accelerator operations."
https://openalex.org/W2004773321,"Of two neurosecretory PC12 cell clones that respond to NO donors and 8-bromo-cGMP with similar increases in cADP-ribose and that possess molecularly similar Ca2+ stores, only one (clone 16A) expresses the type 2 ryanodine receptor, whereas the other (clone 27) is devoid of ryanodine receptors. In PC12-16A cells, activation of the NO/cGMP pathway induced slow [Ca2+]i responses, sustained by release from Ca2+ stores. In contrast, PC12-27 cells were insensitive to NO donors. Likewise, in PC12-16A cells preincubated with NO donors, Ca2+ stores were partially depleted, as revealed by a test with thapsigargin, whereas those in clone 27 were unchanged. The NO-induced Ca2+ release was increased synergistically by caffeine, and the corresponding store depletion was magnified by ryanodine. The specificity for the NO/cGMP pathway was confirmed by the effects of two blockers of cGMP-dependent protein kinase I, while the role of cADP-ribose was demonstrated by the effects of its antagonist, 8-amino-cADP-ribose, administered to permeabilized cells. These results demonstrate in neurosecretory cells a ryanodine receptor activation pathway similar to that known in sea urchin oocytes. The signaling events described here could be of great physiological importance, especially in the nervous system. Of two neurosecretory PC12 cell clones that respond to NO donors and 8-bromo-cGMP with similar increases in cADP-ribose and that possess molecularly similar Ca2+ stores, only one (clone 16A) expresses the type 2 ryanodine receptor, whereas the other (clone 27) is devoid of ryanodine receptors. In PC12-16A cells, activation of the NO/cGMP pathway induced slow [Ca2+]i responses, sustained by release from Ca2+ stores. In contrast, PC12-27 cells were insensitive to NO donors. Likewise, in PC12-16A cells preincubated with NO donors, Ca2+ stores were partially depleted, as revealed by a test with thapsigargin, whereas those in clone 27 were unchanged.

https://openalex.org/W1975085921,"The actin binding and ATPase properties, as well as the functional domain structure of chick brain myosin-V, a two-headed, unconventional myosin, is reported here. Compared to conventional myosin from skeletal muscle, brain myosin-V exhibits low K-EDTA- and Ca-ATPase activities (1.8 and 0.8 ATP/s per head). The physiologically relevant Mg-ATPase is also low (∼0.3 ATP/s), unless activated by the presence of both F-actin and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<i>V</i><sub>max</sub> of 27 ATP/s). Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulates the actin-activated Mg-ATPase over a narrow concentration range between 1 and 3 µM. In the presence of saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 75 mM KCl, surprisingly low concentrations of F-actin activate the Mg-ATPase in a hyperbolic manner (<i>K</i><sub>ATPase</sub> of 1.3 µM). Brain myosin-V also binds with relatively high affinity (compared to other known myosins) to F-actin in the presence of ATP, as assayed by cosedimentation. Digestion of brain myosin-V with calpain yielded a 65-kDa head domain fragment that cosediments with actin in an ATP-sensitive manner and a 80-kDa tail fragment that does not interact with F-actin. The 80-kDa fragment results from cleavage one residue beyond the proline-, glutamate-, serine-, threonine-rich region. Our data indicate that the Mg-ATPase cycle of brain myosin-V is tightly regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, probably via direct binding to the calmodulin light chains in the neck domain, which like brush border myosin-I, results in partial (∼30%) dissociation of the calmodulin associated with brain myosin-V. The effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, which appears to relieve suppression by the neck domain, can be mimicked by calpain cleavage near the head/neck junction."

https://openalex.org/W1978136184,"L1 is a neural cell adhesion molecule that has been shown to help guide nascent axons to their targets. This guidance is based on specific interactions of L1 with its binding partners and is likely to involve signaling cascades that alter cytoskeletal elements in response to these binding events. We have examined the phosphorylation of L1 and the role it may have in L1-directed neurite outgrowth. Cytosolic extracts from nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells were fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography, and an activity was found that phosphorylated the cytoplasmic domain of L1.

INTRODUCTIONThe development of a functional nervous system depends, in part, on the ability of neurons to form the requisite specific connections with their targets. The guidance of axons through varied terrain and over relatively long distances is thought to be influenced by a variety of factors. These include physical channels and chemical signals, either diffusible factors or substrate-bound extracellular matrix molecules or cell surface molecules. Cell adhesion molecules are often involved in providing a suitable substrate upon which neurons can migrate or extend axons. L1 is a cell adhesion molecule that has been implicated in a variety of processes integral to the development of the nervous system, including neuronal migration (Lindner et al., 35Lindner J. Rathjen F.G. Schachner M. Nature. 1983; 305: 427-430Google Scholar), neurite outgrowth (Lagenaur and Lemmon, 31Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Google Scholar), and axon fasciculation (Landmesser et al., 32Landmesser L. Dahm L. Schultz K. Rutishauser U. Dev. Biol. 1988; 130: 645-670Google Scholar; Stallcup and Beasley, 52Stallcup W.B. Beasley L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1276-1280Google Scholar). Mutations in the L1 gene are linked to the human mental retardation diseases X-linked hydrocephalus and MASA (ental retardation, aphasia, shuffling gait, and adducted thumbs) syndrome (Rosenthal et al., 46Rosenthal A. Jouet M. Kenwrick S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 107-112Google Scholar; Wong et al., 60Wong E.V. Kenwrick S. Willems P. Lemmon V. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 168-172Google Scholar), in which defects of the cortocospinal tract and corpus callosum are commonly found.Recent evidence suggests a function for L1 beyond adhesion between two cell surfaces. When a growth cone migrating on laminin contacts L1, its morphology changes quickly, broadening and flattening even before the entire growth cone has moved onto the new substrate (Burden-Gulley et al., 9Burden-Gulley S.M. Payne H.R. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4370-4381Google Scholar). This suggests activation of a signal transduction cascade initiated by L1 contact that eventually affects the cytoskeleton. Further evidence for signal transduction cascades initiated by L1 comes from observations of changes in various intracellular second messenger systems upon activation of L1 by binding with soluble L1 or anti-L1 antibodies (Itoh et al., 27Itoh K. Kawamura H. Asou H. Brain Res. 1992; 580: 233-240Google Scholar; Schuch et al., 50Schuch U. Lohse M.J. Schachner M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 13-20Google Scholar; Von Bohlen und Halbach et al., 56Von Bohlen Halbach F. Taylor J. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 896-909Google Scholar; Williams et al., 57Williams E.J. Doherty P. Turner G. Reid R.A. Hemperly J.J. Walsh F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 883-892Google Scholar).L1 (Moos et al., 38Moos M. Tacke R. Scherer H. Teplow D. Fruh K. Schachner M. Nature. 1988; 334: 701-703Google Scholar) (also termed NILE (Prince et al., 42Prince J.T. Milona N. Stallcup W.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1825-1834Google Scholar), 8D9 (Lemmon and McLoon, 33Lemmon V. McLoon S. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2987-2994Google Scholar), Ng-CAM (Grumet et al., 23Grumet M. Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 267-271Google Scholar), G4 (Rathjen et al., 45Rathjen F.G. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Bonhoeffer F. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104 (b): 343-353Google Scholar)) is primarily expressed on projection axons of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, as well as on a few nonneuronal cell types, including Schwann cells and lymphocytes. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of adhesion molecules (Burden-Gulley and Lemmon, 7Burden-Gulley S.M. Lemmon V. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1995; 6: 79-87Google Scholar), the extracellular domain of which is characterized by six immunoglobulin-like domains and five fibronectin-type III domains, and highly conserved transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The cytoplasmic domain is completely conserved in the known mammalian sequences, and two long stretches are perfectly conserved in the chick, comprising nearly 70% of the cytoplasmic domain (Hlavin and Lemmon, 25Hlavin M.L. Lemmon V. Genomics. 1991; 11: 416-423Google Scholar). Two shorter sequences, one abutting the membrane and one 40 amino acids from the C terminus, are conserved, even in the Drosophila L1 homologue, neuroglian (Bieber et al., 3Bieber A.J. Snow P.M. Hortsch M. Patel N.H. Jacobs J.R. Traquina Z.R. Schilling J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1989; 59: 447-460Google Scholar). There are also two alternatively spliced exons that are present in neuronal L1 but not in L1 expressed in nonneuronal cells (Miura et al., 37Miura M. Kobayashi M. Asou H. Uyemura K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 91-95Google Scholar). The L1 molecule is both glycosylated and phosphorylated (Faissner et al., 18Faissner A. Kruse J. Nieke J. Schachner M. Dev. Brain Res. 1984; 15: 69-82Google Scholar).One possible mechanism for control of the signal transduction cascades initiated by L1 binding is the regulated phosphorylation of L1. We and others have described a number of kinase activities that coprecipitate with L1 immunoprecipitates (Sadoul et al., 47Sadoul R. Kirchhoff F. Schachner M. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1471-1478Google Scholar; Wong et al., 61Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 779-786Google Scholar). We have identified one of these as casein kinase II, which phosphorylates L1 at Ser1181. In this paper, we demonstrate that an S6 family kinase is also associated with L1.The serine/threonine kinase, p90rsk, was initially identified on the basis of its ability to phosphorylate the ribosomal 40 S subunit in vitro. This enzyme has been the focus of much interest due to its ability to be phosphorylated and activated by the mitogen-associated protein kinases and is a component of this growth factor-sensitive signaling cascade (Blenis, 5Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Google Scholar). The role of p90rsk in the nervous system has not been studied directly, but it is reported to be part of an NGF 1The abbreviations used are: NGFnerve growth factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateCAMcell adhesion moleculeCKIIcasein kinase IIPBSphosphate-buffered saline. -inducible signaling cascade in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (Scimeca et al., 51Scimeca J.C. Nguyen T.T. Filloux C. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17369-17374Google Scholar). This paper describes the phosphorylation of a neural cell adhesion molecule, L1, by p90rsk. p90rsk associates with L1 at the membrane and phosphorylates L1 at Ser1152. This phosphorylation may regulate the interactions of L1 and intracellular signaling cascades or cytoskeletal elements involved in neurite outgrowth on specific substrates.DISCUSSIONL1 is a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily that binds to L1 molecules on opposing surfaces and to several other molecules as well (Brummendorf et al., 6Brummendorf T. Hubert M. Treubert U. Leuschner R. Tarnok A. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 711-727Google Scholar; Felsenfeld et al., 19Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Google Scholar; Kuhn et al., 29Kuhn T.B. Stoeckli E.T. Condrau M.A. Rathjen F.G. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1113-1126Google Scholar; Milev et al., 36Milev P.

Accumulating evidence suggests that L1 not only mediates adhesion but also acts as a receptor, transducing extracellular interactions into an intracellular second messenger cascade (Doherty and Walsh, 15Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 49-56Google Scholar), leading ultimately to changes in the behavior of the neuron, influencing migration (Lindner et al., 35Lindner J. Rathjen F.G. Schachner M. Nature. 1983; 305: 427-430Google Scholar), fasciculation (Stallcup and Beasley, 52Stallcup W.B. Beasley L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1276-1280Google Scholar; Landmesser et al., 32Landmesser L. Dahm L. Schultz K. Rutishauser U. Dev. Biol. 1988; 130: 645-670Google Scholar; Cervello et al., 11Cervello M. Lemmon V. Landreth G. Rutishauser U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10548-10552Google Scholar), or axonal outgrowth (Lagenaur and Lemmon, 31Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Google Scholar).The morphology of growth cones from chick retinal ganglion cell neurons differs radically depending upon the substrate on which they are growing (Payne et al., 41Payne H.R. Burden S.M. Lemmon V. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 21: 65-73Google Scholar). When growth cones migrating on laminin first encounter L1, there are significant morphological changes in the growth cone within 1 min (Burden-Gulley et al., 9Burden-Gulley S.M. Payne H.R. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4370-4381Google Scholar). This change is reflected in the redistribution of cytoskeletal components (Burden-Gulley and Lemmon, 8Burden-Gulley S.M. Lemmon V. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar) and is consistent with the idea that L1 binding triggers an intracellular signal that leads to cytoskeletal rearrangement (Atashi et al., 2Atashi J.R. Klinz S.G. Ingraham C.A. Matten W.T. Schachner M. Maness P.F. Neuron. 1992; 8: 831-842Google Scholar). In addition to generating signals via L1-L1 binding, L1 may also act as a signal transducing receptor for other adhesion molecules. Although axonin-1 homophilic interactions are sufficient for adhesion (Rader et al., 43Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Osterwalder T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Google Scholar), neurite outgrowth involving axonin-1 requires an interaction with the chick L1 homologue, Ng-CAM (Kuhn et al., 29Kuhn T.B. Stoeckli E.T. Condrau M.A. Rathjen F.G. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1113-1126Google Scholar). Similarly, TAG-1, the mammalian homologue of axonin-1, interacts with L1 to produce neurite outgrowth (Felsenfeld et al., 19Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Google Scholar). In these situations, L1/Ng-CAM could act as a signal transducing receptor for TAG-1/axonin-1 in TAG-1/axonin-1 directed neurite outgrowth, since these glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked molecules do not have direct communication inside the cell.Several different second messenger systems may be involved in L1-mediated signaling, as evidenced by reports of changes in intracellular Ca2+, pH, and inositol phosphates upon activation of L1 in a variety of cell types (Schuch et al., 50Schuch U. Lohse M.J. Schachner M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 13-20Google Scholar; Von Bohlen und Halbach et al., 1992). Recently, Ca2+ signaling was linked to Ng-CAM expression during neuronal migration in bird forebrain (Goldman et al., 21Goldman S.A. Williams S. Barami K. Lemmon V. Nedergaard M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 29-45Google Scholar). Doherty and Walsh (15Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 49-56Google Scholar) have advanced the idea that activation of a variety of cell adhesion molecules, including L1, leads to activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor and subsequently to an arachidonic acid second messenger cascade (Doherty and Walsh, 15Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 49-56Google Scholar). This cascade involves generation of diacylglycerol by phospholipase Cγ, conversion to arachidonic acid by diacylglycerol lipase, and calcium influx through L- and N-type channels (Doherty et al., 16Doherty P. Furness J. Williams E.J. Walsh F.S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2124-2131Google Scholar; Williams et al., 58Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13 (a): 583-594Google Scholar, 59Williams E.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62 (b): 1231-1234Google Scholar). The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src has also been implicated in neurite outgrowth on L1: neurons from src-knockout mice have a diminished capacity to extend neurites on an L1 substrate (Ignelzi et al., 26Ignelzi Jr., M.A. Miller D.R. Soriano P. Maness P.F. Neuron. 1994; 12: 873-884Google Scholar).On the other hand, relatively little is known about the factors that may regulate the functions of L1 in activating such signaling systems. L1 is both alternatively spliced (Miura et al., 37Miura M. Kobayashi M. Asou H. Uyemura K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 91-95Google Scholar) and phosphorylated (Faissner et al., 18Faissner A. Kruse J. Nieke J. Schachner M. Dev. Brain Res. 1984; 15: 69-82Google Scholar) in the cytoplasmic domain. The phosphorylation suggested a potential mechanism by which L1 activity could be modulated. L1 has been found to be associated with a number of kinases (Sadoul et al., 47Sadoul R. Kirchhoff F. Schachner M. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1471-1478Google Scholar), including casein kinase II (Wong et al., 61Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 779-786Google Scholar). We have previously shown that CKII can phosphorylate L1 on Ser1181 and that it is associated with L1. Continuation of the search for L1 kinases revealed p90rsk, which also coprecipitates with L1 from rat brain membrane preparations.p90rsk is well described in several systems (Blenis, 5Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Google Scholar; Erikson, 17Erikson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6007-6010Google Scholar) and can be activated when it is phosphorylated by mitogen-associated protein kinase kinases. The p90rsk kinase is composed of two kinase domains, an N-terminal cGMP-dependent kinase-like domain and a C-terminal domain bearing resemblance to the catalytic domains of phosphorylase b and Ca2+/calmodulin kinases (Alcorta et al., 1Alcorta D.A. Crews C.M. Sweet L.J. Bankston L. Jones S.W. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3850-3859Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that the N-terminal catalytic domain mediates substrate phosphorylation, whereas the C-terminal domain is involved in autophosphorylation (Bjorbaek et al., 4Bjorbaek C. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18848-18852Google Scholar). There is no clear consensus recognition site for p90rsk, but like the cGMP- and cAMP-dependent kinases, there is a general requirement for basic residues in the vicinity of the target serine or threonine. The residues around Ser1152 do not fit the RXXS consensus found in several p90rsk target sites, but the serine is bracketed by arginine residues in the form RXSXR and may represent a novel site for p90rsk phosphorylation.The discovery of p90rsk began with a search for protein kinases that inducibly phosphorylate the S6 protein (Erikson, 17Erikson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6007-6010Google Scholar; Novak-Hofer and Thomas, 39Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5995-6000Google Scholar; Sturgill and Wu, 53Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Google Scholar). Thus, it was expected to be involved in mitogen-stimulated pathways. However, several other functions have now been linked to this kinase. Among these are insulin-regulated glycogen metabolism, platelet (Papkoff et al., 40Papkoff J. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Forsman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 463-472Google Scholar) and T-cell activation (Calvo et al., 10Calvo V. Bierer B.E. Vik T.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 457-462Google Scholar), stress responses (Jurivich et al., 28Jurivich D.A. Chung J. Blenis J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 252-259Google Scholar), and neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (Scimeca et al., 51Scimeca J.C. Nguyen T.T. Filloux C. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17369-17374Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated pathways leading to p90rsk stimulation involve activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase, followed by sequential activation of Raf, MEK (mitogen-associated protein kinase kinase), erk-1 and erk-2 mitogen-associated protein kinases, and p90rsk (Blenis, 5Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Google Scholar). Activation of such a cascade has been described upon binding of IgM on B lymphocytes (Tordai et al., 55Tordai A. Franklin R.A. Patel H. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7538-7543Google Scholar). Although p90rsk is considered a cytosolic protein, which when activated can translocate to the nucleus, it is also found in membrane fractions (Chen et al., 12Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Google Scholar), and we have recently found p90rsk in growth cone particle preparations purified from rat brain (data not shown).Ser1152, the site of p90rsk action, is located nine amino acids from the membrane, within one of the most highly conserved regions of the molecule. Of note, this serine is conserved only in the closest homologues of L1 and is not in related members of the L1 group of immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules, including the chick proteins Nr-CAM (Grumet et al., 24Grumet M. Mauro V. Burgoon M.P. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1399-1412Google Scholar) and neurofascin (Rathjen et al., 44Rathjen F.G. Wolff J.M. Chang S. Bonhoeffer F. Raper J. Cell. 1987; 51 (a): 841-849Google Scholar) or the rat ankyrin-binding glycoprotein (Davis et al., 14Davis J.Q. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 121-133Google Scholar). The 10 membrane-proximal intracellular residues of Nr-CAM, neurofascin, and ankyrin-binding glycoprotein are identical to L1 except Ser1152, which is changed to a proline residue, implying an important function for this region. The presence of the serine at residue 1152 only in L1 may allow its functional regulation by phosphorylation. The KRSK peptide inhibition studies described here show that perturbation of interactions with this region of the L1 cytoplasmic domain disturbs L1-mediated neurite outgrowth. There is a 33% decrease in the percentage of cells bearing neurites when loaded with the KRSK peptide compared to tracer dye alone or scrambled sequence peptide. Interestingly, the S/A1152 peptide, which is a nonphosphorylatable KRSK peptide, has no significant effect by this measure, indicating that phosphorylation of KRSK is involved in this inhibition of neurite outgrowth. One mechanism by which the inhibition may take place is by competitive inhibition of p90rsk phosphorylation of L1, preventing it from undergoing phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes or protein-protein interactions. Another possible mechanism is that phosphorylation of the KRSK peptide allows it to interact with some other protein, which normally interacts with L1 only when Ser1152 is phosphorylated. Although the putative protein interaction is not known, it is unlikely to be the recently described ankyrin-L1 interaction (Davis and Bennett, 13Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Google Scholar), which has been mapped to a region between residues 1200-1230.The data presented here indicate that L1 is associated with and phosphorylated by the S6 kinase p90rsk, the substrate site of which is Ser1152. Disruption of interactions between L1 and p90rsk or other proteins in the vicinity of Ser1152 has a significant deleterious effect on neurite outgrowth. One of the initial hypotheses in searching for L1 kinases was that they may transiently alter L1 function. The first L1 kinase we found, CKII, is generally in a constitutively active state and unlikely to be acutely regulated. However, p90rsk has previously been well studied as part of an extracellularly initiated signal transduction cascade. Therefore, in contrast to CKII, p90rsk could be involved in a transient change in the phosphorylation state of L1 and consequently lead to changes in the conformational and functional state of L1 that determine the distinct morphological and motile characteristics of neurite outgrowth on L1. INTRODUCTIONThe development of a functional nervous system depends, in part, on the ability of neurons to form the requisite specific connections with their targets. The guidance of axons through varied terrain and over relatively long distances is thought to be influenced by a variety of factors. These include physical channels and chemical signals, either diffusible factors or substrate-bound extracellular matrix molecules or cell surface molecules. Cell adhesion molecules are often involved in providing a suitable substrate upon which neurons can migrate or extend axons. L1 is a cell adhesion molecule that has been implicated in a variety of processes integral to the development of the nervous system, including neuronal migration (Lindner et al., 35Lindner J. Rathjen F.G. Schachner M. Nature. 1983; 305: 427-430Google Scholar), neurite outgrowth (Lagenaur and Lemmon, 31Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Google Scholar), and axon fasciculation (Landmesser et al., 32Landmesser L. Dahm L. Schultz K. Rutishauser U. Dev. Biol. 1988; 130: 645-670Google Scholar; Stallcup and Beasley, 52Stallcup W.B. Beasley L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1276-1280Google Scholar). Mutations in the L1 gene are linked to the human mental retardation diseases X-linked hydrocephalus and MASA (ental retardation, aphasia, shuffling gait, and adducted thumbs) syndrome (Rosenthal et al., 46Rosenthal A. Jouet M. Kenwrick S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 107-112Google Scholar; Wong et al., 60Wong E.V. Kenwrick S. Willems P. Lemmon V. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 168-172Google Scholar), in which defects of the cortocospinal tract and corpus callosum are commonly found.Recent evidence suggests a function for L1 beyond adhesion between two cell surfaces. When a growth cone migrating on laminin contacts L1, its morphology changes quickly, broadening and flattening even before the entire growth cone has moved onto the new substrate (Burden-Gulley et al., 9Burden-Gulley S.M. Payne H.R. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4370-4381Google Scholar). This suggests activation of a signal transduction cascade initiated by L1 contact that eventually affects the cytoskeleton. Further evidence for signal transduction cascades initiated by L1 comes from observations of changes in various intracellular second messenger systems upon activation of L1 by binding with soluble L1 or anti-L1 antibodies (Itoh et al., 27Itoh K. Kawamura H. Asou H. Brain Res. 1992; 580: 233-240Google Scholar; Schuch et al., 50Schuch U. Lohse M.J. Schachner M.

Cell Biol. 1987; 104 (b): 343-353Google Scholar)) is primarily expressed on projection axons of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, as well as on a few nonneuronal cell types, including Schwann cells and lymphocytes. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of adhesion molecules (Burden-Gulley and Lemmon, 7Burden-Gulley S.M. Lemmon V. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1995; 6: 79-87Google Scholar), the extracellular domain of which is characterized by six immunoglobulin-like domains and five fibronectin-type III domains, and highly conserved transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The cytoplasmic domain is completely conserved in the known mammalian sequences, and two long stretches are perfectly conserved in the chick, comprising nearly 70% of the cytoplasmic domain (Hlavin and Lemmon, 25Hlavin M.L. Lemmon V. Genomics. 1991; 11: 416-423Google Scholar). Two shorter sequences, one abutting the membrane and one 40 amino acids from the C terminus, are conserved, even in the Drosophila L1 homologue, neuroglian (Bieber et al., 3Bieber A.J. Snow P.M. Hortsch M. Patel N.H. Jacobs J.R. Traquina Z.R. Schilling J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1989; 59: 447-460Google Scholar). There are also two alternatively spliced exons that are present in neuronal L1 but not in L1 expressed in nonneuronal cells (Miura et al., 37Miura M. Kobayashi M. Asou H. Uyemura K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 91-95Google Scholar). The L1 molecule is both glycosylated and phosphorylated (Faissner et al., 18Faissner A. Kruse J. Nieke J. Schachner M. Dev. Brain Res. 1984; 15: 69-82Google Scholar).One possible mechanism for control of the signal transduction cascades initiated by L1 binding is the regulated phosphorylation of L1. We and others have described a number of kinase activities that coprecipitate with L1 immunoprecipitates (Sadoul et al., 47Sadoul R. Kirchhoff F. Schachner M. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1471-1478Google Scholar; Wong et al., 61Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 779-786Google Scholar). We have identified one of these as casein kinase II, which phosphorylates L1 at Ser1181. In this paper, we demonstrate that an S6 family kinase is also associated with L1.The serine/threonine kinase, p90rsk, was initially identified on the basis of its ability to phosphorylate the ribosomal 40 S subunit in vitro. This enzyme has been the focus of much interest due to its ability to be phosphorylated and activated by the mitogen-associated protein kinases and is a component of this growth factor-sensitive signaling cascade (Blenis, 5Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Google Scholar). The role of p90rsk in the nervous system has not been studied directly, but it is reported to be part of an NGF 1The abbreviations used are: NGFnerve growth factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateCAMcell adhesion moleculeCKIIcasein kinase IIPBSphosphate-buffered saline. -inducible signaling cascade in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (Scimeca et al., 51Scimeca J.C. Nguyen T.T. Filloux C. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17369-17374Google Scholar). This paper describes the phosphorylation of a neural cell adhesion molecule, L1, by p90rsk. p90rsk associates with L1 at the membrane and phosphorylates L1 at Ser1152. This phosphorylation may regulate the interactions of L1 and intracellular signaling cascades or cytoskeletal elements involved in neurite outgrowth on specific substrates."

It has been suggested that in the absence of HSPG, cells are not able to bind bFGF or respond to treatment with bFGF. In our studies, Balb/c3T3 fibroblasts were treated with 50 mM sodium chlorate to completely inhibit (99%) sulfation of proteoglycans. We found that bFGF was able to bind, be internalized, and stimulate DNA synthesis in the absence of HSPG in a dose-dependent manner. bFGF bound to its receptors on chlorate-treated cells with a lower apparent affinity and no change in receptor number. To determine if this decreased affinity bFGF-receptor interaction is functional, we quantitatively analyzed bFGF internalization and stimulation of DNA synthesis in control and chlorate-treated cells. Endocytotic rate constants (ke) for chlorate-treated and control cells were ke = 0.078 ± 0.022 min−1 and ke = 0.043 ± 0.012 min−1, respectively, suggesting that the process of bFGF internalization is not dramatically altered by HSPG. bFGF stimulated DNA synthesis to the same maximal level under both conditions, but chlorate-treated cells were significantly less responsive at low bFGF doses (∼10-fold increase in ED50). The differences observed for control and chlorate-treated cells in the dose-response curves for stimulation of DNA synthesis and receptor binding correlated directly, suggesting that receptors are equally capable of eliciting a mitogenic signal under both conditions. It is unlikely that these results are due to residual HSPG since heparinase (I and III) digestion of chlorate-treated cells had little effect. Although the presence of HSPG on the cell surface increases the affinity of bFGF for its receptors, our observations suggest that HSPG are not “absolutely” required for binding, internalization, or stimulation of mitogenic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2125727048,"Defensins are naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides that may participate in host defense against microorganisms. We previously reported that the amino acid sequence of leukocyte defensins resembles the lysine-binding site in the kringles of plasminogen and that defensin inhibits fibrinolysis mediated by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen. In the present paper we analyze the mechanisms of this inhibition. Defensin binds specifically to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (half-maximal binding = 3 µM) as well as to fibrin. At saturating concentrations (5-10 µM), defensin stimulates the maximum binding of plasminogen to HUVEC and to fibrin approximately 10-fold. However, defensin inhibits plasminogen binding to both surfaces at concentrations >10 µM. Defensin also inhibits tPA and plasminogen-mediated fibrinolysis in a dose-dependent manner at all concentrations tested. Fibrinolysis is almost totally inhibited by 6 µM defensin, a concentration that stimulates the binding of plasminogen to fibrin. Discordance between the enhancement of plasminogen binding and its activation cannot be explained by an inhibitory effect of defensin on tPA binding nor by inhibition of plasmin activity, each of which occur only at higher concentrations. Rather, these results suggest that plasminogen bound to fibrin in the presence of defensin is less susceptible to activation by tPA.

Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11470-11478Google Scholar, 23Eaton D.L. Fless G.M. Kohr W.J. McLean J.W. Xu Q.T. Miller C.G. Lawn R.M. Scanu A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Further, we reported preliminary studies which suggest that defensins inhibit fibrinolysis by interacting with tPA and plasminogen. Plasminogen activation occurs not only on the surface of fibrin clots, but on the surface of vascular endothelial cells. Endothelial cells express specific binding sites for tPA and for plasminogen (25Barnathan E.S. Kuo A. van der Keyl H. McCrae K.R. Larsen G.R. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7792-7799Google Scholar, 26Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Google Scholar, 27Beebe D.P. Miles L.A. Plow E.F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Google Scholar), and plasmin formation is accelerated when both reactants bind to their respective receptors (25Barnathan E.S. Kuo A. van der Keyl H. McCrae K.R. Larsen G.R. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7792-7799Google Scholar, 30Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Google Scholar). Conversely, interruption of plasmin generation at these sites could contribute to fibrin formation and microvascular occlusion in situations where thrombin formation is accelerated, such as after infection and tissue injury. In the present paper, we report that leukocyte defensins bind to endothelial cells as well as to fibrin and indeed inhibit plasmin formation. These effects are seen at concentrations that are well below those reported to cause cytotoxicity and, in contrast to its cytotoxic effects, occur in the presence of serum albumin. Glu-plasminogen, Lys-plasminogen, and single-chain tPA were provided by American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT); fibrinogen (plasminogen-free), bovine serum albumin, human thrombin, and 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA) were obtained from Sigma. Defensin (HNP-2) was prepared and characterized as described previously (1Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Szklarek D. Harwig S.S.L. Daher K. Bainton D.F. Lehrer R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; : 1427-1435Google Scholar, 31Harwig S.S. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 160-172Google Scholar). Proteins were radiolabeled with 125I using lactoperoxidase (Sigma). Labeled proteins were separated from free iodine using gel filtration (PD-10; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad microprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In each experiment, the specific activities of each protein ranged between 1000 and 4000 cpm/ng. To test whether iodination altered the binding properties of defensin, aliquots of defensin were iodinated with nonradioactive potassium iodide for 1 h using the same method. There was no difference in capacity of unlabeled and nonradioactive iodinated defensin to compete for the binding of 125I-labeled defensin to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (see below), consistent with preservation of other functional activities described previously (14Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Nguyen T.-M. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2686-2694Google Scholar). Cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were prepared and characterized as described previously (32Cines D.B. Lyss A.P. Reeber M.J. Bina M. DeHoratius R. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 611-625Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 48-well Falcon multitissue culture dishes (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) to a final density of approximately 5 × 104 cells/well. To impede cytotoxicity by defensin and to prevent internalization of ligands, the cells were prechilled to 4°C for 30 min and washed twice with a prechilled binding buffer composed of phosphate-buffered saline and 1% albumin. 125I-Labeled ligands were added in the same buffer for 90 min at 4°C in the absence of unlabeled competitor to determine total binding. The same experiments were performed in the presence of 10-50-fold molar excess unlabeled ligand to determine nonspecific binding. In each case, unbound ligand was removed, the cells were washed four times with binding buffer, and the cell surface associated radioactivity released with 50 mM glycine HCl, pH 2.8, was counted. Specific binding was defined as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. In the case of plasminogen, nonspecific binding was also determined by adding 20 mM 6-AHA, where indicated. Fibrin clots were prepared using thrombin (0.5 NIH units) as described previously (18Higazi A.A.-R. Barghouti I.I. Abu-Much R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9472-9477Google Scholar), and the binding of defensin, tPA, and plasminogen at 22°C was determined as above. In other experiments, total binding was measured in the same manner at 37°C. In another set of experiments, binding of 125I-defensin to plasminogen in solution was analyzed. 125I-defensin (2 µM) and Glu-plasminogen (2 µM) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, the complex was applied to a Sephadex G-75 (Pharmacia) column, and the radioactivity and the absorbance at 280 nm of each fraction were measured. Fibrinolytic activity was measured as described previously (33Higazi A.A.-R. Aziza R. Samara A.A. Mayer M. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 251-255Google Scholar). Briefly, plasminogen-free fibrin clots trace-labeled with 125I-fibrinogen were formed by adding thrombin for 40 min, and the clots were washed extensively. tPA (15 nM) and plasminogen (300 nM) were added in the absence or in the presence of the indicated concentrations of defensin for 45 min, and the released radioactivity was measured. Human neutrophil extracts containing defensin inhibit tPA-mediated fibrinolysis by inhibiting the binding of Glu-plasminogen to fibrin (18Higazi A.A.-R. Barghouti I.I. Abu-Much R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9472-9477Google Scholar). Since endothelial cells express binding sites for plasminogen, we examined whether defensins have a similar effect on the binding of plasminogen to its cellular receptors. Defensin had a biphasic effect on the binding of [125I-Glu]plasminogen to HUVECs (Fig. 1). Binding of plasminogen was augmented approximately 8-fold at low concentrations of defensin (6 µM), but was inhibited to almost basal levels at higher concentrations (34 µM). Additional experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism by which defensin augmented the binding of plasminogen. We first asked whether the increase in binding of Glu-plasminogen seen at low concentrations of defensin is attributable solely to a conformational change in the ligand that makes it similar to Lys-plasminogen which is known to bind to HUVECs with higher affinity and capacity (Bmax) (34Hajjar K.A. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1769-1778Google Scholar). Defensin showed a similar biphasic effect on the binding of [125I-Lys]plasminogen to HUVECs, making this explanation unlikely (Fig. 1). Alternatively, the stimulatory effect of defensin on the binding of Glu-plasminogen may be explicable by one of the following mechanisms. 1) Defensin may bind to endothelial cells providing novel sites to which plasminogen can bind; 2) defensin may bind to Glu- and to Lys-plasminogen directly, and the resultant complex may express novel cell binding epitopes; or 3) both mechanisms may be operative. To explore these possibilities, we began by asking whether defensin binds to HUVECs. The results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that defensin indeed binds to HUVECs in a dose-dependent, specific, and saturable manner, with half-maximal binding attained at a concentration of 3 µM. The same results were seen when total binding was studied at 37°C. Binding of defensin to HUVECs was not stimulated by physiologic concentrations of plasminogen (Fig. 3). Indeed, binding of defensin was inhibited at high plasminogen concentrations (Fig. 3). This finding can be explained by the capacity of plasminogen to bind defensin through the same epitopes that participate in its binding to the cell. Consistent with this possibility, plasminogen bound directly to defensin in solution (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Plasminogen inhibits the binding of defensin to HUVECs. 125I-Defensin (3 µM) was incubated with HUVECs in the presence of the indicated concentrations of plasminogen, and the binding was measured. Higher concentrations of plasminogen did not inhibit the binding of defensin further. The mean ± S.D. of three experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Binding of defensin to plasminogen in solution. 125I-Defensin (2 µM) and Glu-plasminogen (2 µM) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, separated on Sephadex G-75, and the counts/min (⊡) and the absorbance (♦) of each fraction were measured. The designation 1 refers to the mobility plasminogen alone; the designation 2 refers to the mobility of defensin alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results led us to re-explore the interaction between defensin and plasminogen on fibrin in greater detail, since only an inhibitory effect of defensin was observed in our previous study (18Higazi A.A.-R. Barghouti I.I. Abu-Much R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9472-9477Google Scholar). However, these experiments were performed at a single, high concentration of defensin (approximately 17 µM). When we repeated these experiments over a wider range of defensin concentrations, a biphasic effect on the binding of plasminogen to fibrin was seen, similar to the effect on HUVECs (Fig. 5). We next examined the mechanism by which defensin stimulated the binding of Glu-plasminogen to fibrin and to HUVECs. Increasing concentrations of [125I-Glu]plasminogen were incubated with fibrin in the presence of a fixed concentration of defensin (8 µM). Defensin increased the binding of plasminogen at each concentration tested with little change in its binding affinity (half-maximal concentration) (Fig. 6). Defensin also increased the binding of plasminogen to HUVECs (∼10-fold increase in the Bmax) with an ∼5.5-fold decrease in the affinity of binding (not shown). These results suggest that additional, low affinity plasminogen binding sites are exposed or are generated on fibrin and on HUVECs in the presence of defensin. To determine whether the defensin-induced binding is through the lysine binding sites in plasminogen, the effect of 6-AHA was examined. 6-AHA (20 mM) inhibited binding of Glu-plasminogen to HUVECs in the presence and in the absence of defensin 78% (not shown). To determine whether defensin and plasminogen share binding sites on fibrin and on HUVECs, we examined the capacity of Lys-plasminogen to compete with defensin for binding. In accord with this possibility, Lys-plasminogen inhibited the binding of defensin to fibrin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). Lys-plasminogen also inhibited the binding of defensin to HUVECs (not shown).Fig. 6Defensin stimulates the binding of Glu-plasminogen to fibrin. [125I-Glu]Plasminogen (0-9 µM) was added to fibrin in the absence (□––□) or in the presence (♦––♦) of defensin (8 µM), and the binding of defensin was measured. Specific binding was determined in replicate wells by adding 20 mM 6-AHA. One experiment, representative of three so performed, is shown. The inset shows a Lineweaver-Burk plot of the data from this experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 7Lys-plasminogen inhibits the binding of defensin to fibrin. 125I-Defensin (3 µM) was incubated with fibrin in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Lys-plasminogen, and the binding was measured. The mean ± S.D. of three experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Based on this, we next examined whether low concentrations of defensin, which stimulated the binding of plasminogen to fibrin, stimulated fibrinolysis to the same extent. To our surprise, defensin inhibited plasminogen activator activity at concentrations that promoted binding of Glu-plasminogen to fibrin (Fig. 8). This result cannot be attributed to inhibition of plasmin since we have previously reported that defensin is a weak inhibitor of plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis (18Higazi A.A.-R. Barghouti I.I. Abu-Much R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9472-9477Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored two other possible mechanisms to explain the discordance between plasminogen binding and activation. One possibility is that defensin inhibits the binding of tPA to fibrin. An alternative possibility is that defensin renders plasminogen less susceptible to cleavage by tPA. Indeed, defensin inhibited the binding of tPA to fibrin at all concentrations tested, including those that stimulated the binding of plasminogen to fibrin (Fig. 9). Further, tPA inhibited the binding of defensin to fibrin and to HUVECs (Fig. 10), suggesting a competitive mechanism of inhibition. However, the concentrations required to inhibit tPA binding were well above those required to inhibit fibrinolysis, suggesting that plasminogen bound to the surface of fibrin in the presence of defensin is less susceptible to cleavage by tPA.Fig. 9Defensin inhibits the binding of tPA to fibrin. 125I-tPA (15 nM) was incubated with fibrin in the presence of the indicated concentrations of defensin, and the bound radioactivity was measured.

The mean ± S.D. of three experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The observation that leukocyte defensin binds to human endothelial cells in a dose-dependent, saturable, and specific manner without causing cytotoxicity has not been reported previously to our knowledge. The cellular localization of such sites suggests this family of peptides may express important physiological or pathophysiologic effects on hemostasis in addition to their capacity to lyse prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Binding of defensin to HUVECs was half-maximal at 3 µM which is approximately 15-fold less than has been reported to cause cytotoxicity upon prolonged incubation (12Okrent D.G. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 179-185Google Scholar). Binding did not follow a typical hyperbolic pattern. This suggests, among other possibilities, participation of more than one class of binding sites. Our results also indicate that defensin binds plasminogen in solution. The likely explanation for this finding rests in the fact that defensin is an arginine-rich peptide. Kringle-kringle interactions can be mediated by binding of arginine in one kringle to the lysine binding sites in other kringles (35de Vos A.M. Ultsch M.H. Kelley R.F. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Westbrook M. Kossiakoff A.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 270-279Google Scholar, 36Liu J. Harpel P.C. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2554-2560Google Scholar). It is likely that the arginine residues on the surface of the defensin behave in a similar manner. This direct interaction also probably accounts for the observation that low concentrations of defensin that bind to fibrin as well as to cells increase the binding of Glu-plasminogen to these surfaces. The possibility that defensin induces a conformational change from the strained Glu-plasminogen to the relaxed conformation assumed by Lys-plasminogen, which is known to bind with higher affinity and capacity to HUVEC, does not provide a sufficient explanation since defensin stimulated the binding of Lys-plasminogen to a comparable extent. It appears likely that the enhanced binding of plasminogen to HUVECs is mediated primarily by a direct interaction of defensin with the cell surface on the one hand and plasminogen on the other, rather than binding of soluble complexes through sites on both molecules. In support of this contention, plasminogen did not enhance the binding of defensin at any concentration tested. Rather, it is likely that occupation of the lysine binding sites in plasminogen, required for binding to HUVECs (26Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Google Scholar, 29Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Checko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Google Scholar, 37Hajjar K.A. Harpel P.C. Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11656-11662Google Scholar), leave them unavailable to bind defensin. The fact that similar results were seen with fibrin indicates that the effect of defensin on the binding of plasminogen to HUVECs cannot simply be ascribed to protein synthesis or redistribution of internal proteins to the cell surface. Furthermore, fibrin provides a less complex but relevant model to study the mechanism by which defensin affects plasminogen activation in greater detail. The capacity of plasminogen to bind defensin in solution also helps to explain why high concentrations of the peptide inhibit plasminogen binding to cells and to fibrin. When defensin is present at concentrations that exceed its binding capacity, the equilibrium between binding sites for plasminogen on surfaces and those in solution are disturbed. The same mechanism may explain why high concentrations of plasminogen inhibit binding of defensin to cells or fibrin. However, the possibility that both molecules compete for a single binding site at these concentrations must also be considered (18Higazi A.A.-R. Barghouti I.I. Abu-Much R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9472-9477Google Scholar). The biphasic effect of defensin on the binding of plasminogen is reminiscent of the effect of Lp(a) (36Liu J. Harpel P.C. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2554-2560Google Scholar). Binding of plasminogen to fibrin is inhibited at low concentrations of Lp(a), but stimulated at high concentrations (36Liu J. Harpel P.C. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2554-2560Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect has been attributed to a direct binding of several molecules of plasminogen to each molecule of fibrin-bound Lp(a) (36Liu J. Harpel P.C. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2554-2560Google Scholar). This stimulatory effect is similar to our purported explanation for the increase in plasminogen binding to cells and fibrin by defensin. Inhibition of plasminogen- and tPA-mediated fibrinolysis by defensin at the same concentrations that stimulate plasminogen binding is also reminiscent of the effect of Lp(a) (36Liu J. Harpel P.C. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2554-2560Google Scholar). It has been reported that the plasminogen molecules that bind to Lp(a) with low affinity are activated by tPA with less efficiency and that Lp(a) impairs plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis directly (36Liu J. Harpel P.C. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2554-2560Google Scholar). In the case of defensin, such steric considerations are only one of several possible explanations. First, defensin directly inhibits the binding of tPA to fibrin which can be explained by its ability to interact with the lysine binding site in kringle 2 of tPA (38Hu C.-K. Kohnert U. Wilhelm O. Fischer S. Llinas M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11760-11766Google Scholar) However, tPA-mediated fibrinolysis was inhibited at lower concentrations of defensin than were required to inhibit the binding of tPA. This result suggests that plasminogen becomes less susceptible to activation by tPA in the presence of defensin. Thus, even at low concentrations of defensin where plasminogen binding is enhanced, the bound plasminogen molecules have lost their susceptibility to be cleaved, either because they have undergone a conformational change or because defensin causes a redistribution of plasminogen on fibrin which physically separates it from bound tPA. The fact defensin inhibits plasminogen activation by tPA even in the absence of fibrin provides some support for the former explanation, especially in view of the modest effects of defensin on plasmin activity (18Higazi A.A.-R. Barghouti I.I. Abu-Much R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9472-9477Google Scholar). There may be a similar explanation for the dissociation between binding of plasminogen to fibrin and its activation in the presence of Lp(a). All of the binding experiments described in this study were performed in protein-containing buffers at concentrations of defensin at or below 34 µM. Plasma concentrations of defensin have been reported to approach 50 µM in some patients during sepsis and bacterial meningitis (10Panyutich A.V. Panyutich E.A. Krapivin V.A. Baturevich E.A. Ganz T. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 122: 202-207Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that defensin binds to endothelial cells and to fibrin in vivo under these conditions. The capacity of leukocyte defensins to inhibit fibrinolysis may have a beneficial effect by helping to contain microbial invasion (21Menkin V. Physiol. Rev. 1938; 18: 366-392Google Scholar). However, it is also clear that defensin may impair fibrinolysis or plasmin generation required for other physiologic process such as matrix remodeling, activation of transforming growth factor β, etc. (39Grainger D.J. Kemp P.R. Liu A.C. Lawn R.M. Metcalfe J.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 460-462Google Scholar). Whether interrupting the interaction of defensins with fibrin or the endothelium may exert favorable effects on fibrinolysis requires further study."

All three eicosanoids stimulate Ca2+ transients and chemotaxis in human neutrophils (PMN). However, unlike LTB4, 5-oxoETE and 5-oxo-15(OH)-ETE alone cause little degranulation and no superoxide anion production. However, we show herein that, in PMN pretreated with granulocyte-macrophage or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF or G-CSF), the oxoETEs become potent activators of the last responses. The oxoETEs also induce translocation of secretory vesicles from the cytosol to the plasmalemma, an effect not requiring cytokine priming. To study the mechanism of PMN activation in response to the eicosanoids, we examined the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). PMN expressed three proteins (40, 42, and 44 kDa) that reacted with anti-MAPK antibodies. The oxoETEs, LTB4, GM-CSF, and G-CSF all stimulated PMN to activate the MAPKs and cPLA2, as defined by shifts in these proteins' electrophoretic mobility and tyrosine phosphorylation of the MAPKs. However, the speed and duration of the MAPK response varied markedly depending on the stimulus. 5-OxoETE caused a very rapid and transient activation of MAPK. In contrast, the response to the cytokines was rather slow and persistent. PMN pretreated with GM-CSF demonstrated a dramatic increase in the extent of MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation and electrophoretic mobility shift in response to 5-oxoETE. Similarly, 5-oxoETE induced PMN to release some preincorporated [14C]arachidonic acid, while GM-CSF greatly enhanced the extent of this release. Thus, the synergism exhibited by these agents is prominent at the level of MAPK stimulation and phospholipid deacylation. Pertussis toxin, but not Ca2+ depletion, inhibited MAPK responses to 5-oxoETE and LTB4, indicating that responses to both agents are coupled through G proteins but not dependent upon Ca2+ transients. 15-OxoETE and 15(OH)-ETE were inactive while 5-oxo-15(OH)-ETE and 5(OH)-ETE had 3- and 10-fold less potency than 5-oxoETE, indicating a rather strict structural specificity for the 5-keto group. LY 255283, a LTB4 antagonist, blocked the responses to LTB4 but not to 5-oxoETE. Therefore, the oxoETEs do not appear to operate through the LTB4 receptor.

Here it is shown that stromelysin-1 gene induction by PDGF depends on Ras and involves three previously identified promoter elements (the stromelysin-1 PDGF-responsive element (SPRE) site, the two head-to-head polyomavirus enhancer A-binding protein-3 (PEA3) sites, and the activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site). During mitogenic induction, these responsive elements appear to be organized in two independent transcriptional units, SPRE-AP-1 and PEA3-AP-1, which result from specific element cross-talking. Interestingly, expression of a dominant negative mutant of Raf-1 significantly interfered with the induction through PEA3-AP-1 but not with that operating through SPRE-AP-1. Conversely, only the induction operating through SPRE-AP-1 was affected significantly by the expression of a dominant negative mutant of the atypical λ/ι protein kinase C (λ/ιPKC). These data strongly suggest that the signal triggered by PDGF flows through Ras and bifurcates toward two distinct pathways, one operating through Raf and involving PEA3-AP-1 and the other one Raf-independent, operating through λ/ιPKC and SPRE-AP-1. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that the novel SPRE-binding transcription factor SPBP cross-couples with c-Jun to transactivate the SPRE site.

A number of mitogenic molecules including growth factors, proto-oncogenes, oncogenes, and tumor promoters induce the expression of stromelysin-1, an extracellular matrix-degrading metalloproteinase (Matrisian et al., 20Matrisian L.M.

Three specific DNA elements in the promoter of the human stromelysin-1 gene have been implicated in mitogenic induction: the SPRE 1The abbreviations used are: SPREstromelysin-1 platelet-derived growth factor-responsive elementPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorPEA3polyomavirus enhancer A-binding protein-3AP-1activator protein-1SPBPSPRE-binding proteinPKCprotein kinase CGSTglutathione S-transferase. (stromelysin-1 PDGF-responsive element) (Sanz et al., 27Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dominguez I. Lozano J. Johansen T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10044-10049Google Scholar), the PEA3 site (polyomavirus enhancer A-binding protein-3 site) (Wasylyk et al., 32Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Google Scholar; Buttice and Kurkinen, 7Buttice G. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7196-7204Google Scholar), and the AP-1 site (activator protein-1 binding site) (Kerr et al., 16Kerr L.D. Holt J.T. Matrisian L.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1424-1427Google Scholar). The AP-1 site (centered at −67) is the most proximal element and is the target of the Fos and Jun transcription factors (Curran and Franza, 10Curran T. Franza Jr., B.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 395-397Google Scholar). In the stromelysin-1 gene, two PEA3 elements are arranged head to head (Quinones et al., 25Quinones S. Saus J. Otani Y. Harris Jr., E.D. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8339-8344Google Scholar; Buttice and Kurkinen, 7Buttice G. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7196-7204Google Scholar), resulting in a palindromic element (centered at −208) with two binding sites for Ets transcription factors (Wasylyk et al., 32Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Google Scholar). Finally, SPRE, the most distal of the three elements (centered at −1573), is the binding site of a new transcription factor, SPBP (SPRE-binding protein) (Sanz et al., 27Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M.

Studies on rat and human stromelysin-1 gene expression have independently identified two of the above elements, SPRE and AP-1, as playing major roles in PDGF induction (Kerr et al., 16Kerr L.D. Holt J.T. Matrisian L.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1424-1427Google Scholar; Sanz et al., 27Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dominguez I. Lozano J. Johansen T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10044-10049Google Scholar). Similar studies have implicated each of the three elements in the Ras activation of the stromelysin-1 gene (Imler et al., 15Imler J.L. Schatz C. Wasylyk C. Chatton B. Wasylyk B. Nature. 1988; 332: 275-278Google Scholar; Wasylyk et al., 30Wasylyk C. Flores P. Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3371-3378Google Scholar, 32Wasylyk C. Gutman A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22597-22602Google Scholar). Because it has been established that Ras is an intermediate in the mitogenic cascade triggered by PDGF, it was of interest to investigate whether, in fact, these three elements all contribute to the induction of the human stromelysin-1 gene by PDGF. In this report, by transient gene expression experiments using promoter constructs extending upstream to −2311 and mutants thereof, we show that both PDGF and c-Ha-ras induce transcription of the human gene through two different functional units, one comprising the SPRE and AP-1 sites and the other involving the two head-to-head PEA3 elements and the AP-1 site. Moreover we present evidence supporting the idea that SPBP and c-Jun, a critical component of the AP-1 transcription factor, cross-couple to yield heteromers that efficiently transactivate the SPRE site and therefore have potential relevance in the transactivation of the SPRE-AP-1 unit. It has been established that phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine plays a crucial role in mitogenic signaling of mammalian cells (Larrodera et al., 18Larrodera P. Cornet M.E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lopez-Barahona M. Diaz-Laviada I. Guddal P.H. Johansen T. Moscat J. Cell. 1990; 61: 1113-1120Google Scholar and references therein) and suggested that phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C acts downstream of Ras in the PDGF-triggered mitogenic cascade (Lopez-Barahona et al., 19Lopez-Barahona M. Kaplan P.L. Cornet M.E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Larrodera P. Diaz-Laviada I. Municio A.M. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9022-9026Google Scholar; Diaz-Meco et al., 11Diaz-Meco M.T. Quiñones S. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Bernal D. Saus J. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22597-22602Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent evidence supports the existence of a bifurcation of the PDGF-mitogenic signaling pathway downstream of phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C with λ/ιPKC 2By using a cDNA probe encoding the regulatory domain of the atypical rat ζPKC, we cloned a PKC isotype from Xenopus laevis which was initially named ζPKC because it displayed an overall 72% identity with the rat counterpart. The more recent description of other atypical PKC isotypes has allowed the comparison of the X. laevis enzyme with all known subspecies. On the basis of their sequence alignment, the X. laevis atypical PKC shows the highest identity with λ/ιPKC (90%). and Raf-1 located in separated branches (Sanz et al., 27Sanz L. Berra E.

In this study we show that each of the PDGF-mitogenic branched pathways is specifically involved in the activation of a single transcriptional unit. Thus, the PEA3-AP-1 unit activation is essentially Raf-dependent, whereas the alternative λ/ιPKC-dependent pathway operates through the SPRE-AP-1 unit. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C. NIH 3T3 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Eighteen hours later the medium was changed, and after an additional 3-h incubation cells were transfected with 1 µg of total DNA (0.5 µg of reporter plasmid and 0.5 µg of DNA consisting of the corresponding expression vectors or calf thymus carrier DNA) in calcium phosphate for 5 h followed by a glycerol shock. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated overnight in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed twice again with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 72 h in medium containing low serum (0.5% fetal bovine serum). In PDGF induction assays, after 30 h in low serum conditions, the cells were induced for 72 h with 10 ng/ml human recombinant PDGF BB (Promega, Madison, WI). Human growth hormone levels were determined using a solid phase radioimmunoassay system (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). Unless indicated transfection experiments were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The transfections and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays detailed in Fig. 7 were essentially performed as described previously (Sanz et al., 27Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dominguez I. Lozano J. Johansen T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10044-10049Google Scholar). For transfection purposes, the oligomers described under “Plasmid Construction” and their complementary counterparts were annealed in the presence of 200 mM NaCl and stored at 4°C until needed. To obtain XXB1, the 1,833-base pair XbaI fragment of the HAF-10 genomic clone containing the −2311 to −479 of the human stromelysin-1 promoter was subcloned upstream of the corresponding −478 to −11 fragment present in a previously described growth hormone expression vector (Quinones et al., 25Quinones S. Saus J. Otani Y. Harris Jr., E.D. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8339-8344Google Scholar). Clones SPREmut, PEA3mut, and SPRE-PEA3mut were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) of the full-length clone XXB1 using the following mutagenic oligonucleotides (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.): 5′-CCATAGAATACTAcaTTTAAAATGTCTTTAGGCC-3′ for SPREmut and 5′-CTACCAAGACAaGAAGCACTTCtTGGAGATTAATC-3′ for PEA3mut. The ΔAP-1 construct was obtained by cloning the above 1,833-base pair XbaI fragment into the original AP-1 deletion mutant clone kindly provided by Markku Kurkinen (Buttice et al., 8Buttice G. Quinones S. Kurkinen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3723-3731Google Scholar) after removing from it the inverted −1308 to −479 fragment. To obtain the thymidine kinase series of the individual elements, annealed synthetic oligonucleotides representing isolated elements with adaptor flanking regions were cloned into the HindIII-BamHI sites of the BLGH expression vector located upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter therein (Quinones et al., 26Quinones S. Buttice G. Kurkinen M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 471-477Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were: ON SPRE, 5′-AGCTTATAGAATACTAGTTTTAG-3′; ON SPREmut, 5′-AGCTTATAGAATACTAcaTTTAG-3′ (Sanz et al., 27Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dominguez I. Lozano J. Johansen T.

All of the constructs were characterized by nucleotide sequencing and restriction mapping. Dominant negative expression constructs were as described previously (Cai et al., 9Cai H. Szeberenyi J.

The production of palCAT, pcDNA3HASPBP plasmids, and RSV-c-Jun expression vector have been described elsewhere (Sanz et al., 27Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dominguez I. Lozano J. Johansen T.

Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Google Scholar). The GST-constructs were generously provided by Bernd Stein, and the c-Ha-Ras expressing construct was a gift from Scott Powers. Mobility assays were performed as described previously (Sanz et al., 28Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Google Scholar) using nuclear extracts from either PDGF or serum-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells. Where indicated the preincubation mixture contained anti-Jun antibodies, which recognize c-Jun, JunB, and JunD, or anti-Fos antibodies, which recognize c-Fos, Fra1, and Fra2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The SPBP mRNA was obtained from linearized pcDNA3HASPBP plasmid (10 µg) using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of the cap analog GpppG and further translated (1 µg) in a nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate system using a methionine-free amino acid mixture supplemented with [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Control mixtures contained no mRNA. Equal amounts of GST-c-Fos or GST-c-Jun immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in LSBT buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1.5% Triton X-100) were incubated with 5 µl of 35S-labeled translation mixture in a final volume of 200 µl in the presence of 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 10 min at 37°C and 40 min at room temperature in an effective end-to-end mixing device, the beads were successively collected, washed with 0.5 M NaCl in LSBT, and equilibrated in 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8. The bound proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. pGEX-in constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli JM101 and the corresponding GST-fusion proteins expressed and purified following the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia). We have reported previously a sequence obtained from a subclone of the human stromelysin-1 gene promoter (Quinones et al., 25Quinones S. Saus J. Otani Y. Harris Jr., E.D. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8339-8344Google Scholar). Based on the recent observation of a partial inversion and an additional 1 kilobase of promoter sequence interrupting that reported previously (Borden et al., 5Borden P. Song K. Heller R.A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 315-320Google Scholar), we reanalyzed our original clones and mappings. The results indicate that the original subclone sequenced by us inadvertently contained the (−2311) XbaI-SacI (−1478) fragment attached to the (−478) XbaI site in the inverse orientation and did not contain the immediately adjacent, authentic (−1477) SacI-XbaI (−479) fragment. The corrected map is presented in Fig. 1. Results of polymerase chain reaction studies confirm that the rearrangement is not present in the original genomic clone isolated (HAF-10) nor in the gene promoter construct (XXB1) used in the experiments detailed below (data not shown). The corrected sequence of the promoter fragment extending upstream to −2311 has been submitted to the GenBank/EMBL Data Bank with accession number U43511. Using a fragment of the human stromelysin-1 gene promoter extending from −2311 to −11 attached to a human growth hormone reporter vector (XXB1), we first investigated the effects of PDGF and c-Ha-ras on the wild type promoter activity (Fig. 2). Saturating amounts of PDGF (10 ng/ml) resulted in an induction of approximately 2.6-fold the control levels. This induction could be abolished completely by the cotransfection of a plasmid encoding a dominant negative Ras mutant prior to PDGF treatment, consistent with the notion that Ras is an important intermediary step in the PDGF signaling cascade. Similar to PDGF, cotransfection with c-Ha-ras resulted in increased stromelysin-1 gene promoter activity, surpassing the fold induction observed with saturating amounts of PDGF at concentrations of Ras of 0.15-0.3 µg/well (Fig. 2). Using several different human stromelysin-1 promoter constructs, we and others have identified three positive DNA elements (the SPRE site, the two head-to-head PEA3 sites, and the AP-1 site) which activate transcription in response to various stimuli, including PDGF and Ras (Wasylyk et al., 32Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Google Scholar; Buttice et al., 8Buttice G. Quinones S. Kurkinen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3723-3731Google Scholar, 1993; Quiñones et al., 1994; Sanz et al., 27Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dominguez I. Lozano J. Johansen T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10044-10049Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of each element in transcriptional activation by PDGF, we first assayed constructs containing the individual elements or nonfunctional mutant counterparts, attached to the heterologous promoter of thymidine kinase. The results demonstrate that each element, but not the corresponding mutant (not shown), was able to confer inducibility to the thymidine kinase promoter in response to PDGF (Fig. 3) and c-Ha-ras (not shown) and that expression of a dominant negative Ras mutant abolished the observed induction (Fig. 3). In the next series of experiments we assayed the same elements in the context of a large native promoter. Thus, the activity of mutant constructs in which one or more of the above elements was altered was compared with that of the wild type promoter (Fig. 4). Mutations disrupting the SPRE or PEA3 sites resulted in approximately a 40% and 60% decrease, respectively, in induction by either Ras (Fig. 4) or PDGF (not shown). Interestingly, in the mutant where the AP-1 site was removed (ΔAP1), no significant induction was observed. This indicates that in the context of the human stromelysin-1 promoter, PDGF and Ras require a functional AP-1 site to induce the human stromelysin-1 gene and suggests that SPRE and PEA3 sites contribute to different extents to this induction. Furthermore, it appears that the major induction is directed through the SPRE and PEA3 elements since transfection of double-stranded oligonucleotides representing either of these elements, but not the corresponding nonfunctional mutants (not shown), can efficiently inhibit transcription when the promoter harbors a mutation in the other element. Under these conditions the levels of promoter activity were similar to those of the mutant in which the AP-1 site was deleted (Fig. 4) or to those in which the inducer was missing (not shown). Consistently, a construct containing inactivating mutations of both SPRE and PEA3 elements and harboring a functional AP-1 was noninducible (Fig. 4). These data strongly suggest that the human stromelysin-1 gene promoter contains at least two different functional transcriptional units responsive to PDGF and Ras, one involving the SPRE and the AP-1 sites and the other involving the two head-to-head PEA3 and the AP-1 sites.Fig. 4Effect of mutated elements and oligonucleotide competition on the induction of XXB1 by c-Ha-ras. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 0.5 µg/well of either XXB1 (wild type, WT) or mutants thereof: SPREmut, PEA3mut, SPRE-PEA3mut, or ΔAP-1 construct, in the presence of 0.25 µg/well of the c-Ha-ras expression vector. In competition experiments, transfections were performed in the presence of 0.25 µg/well (150 molar excess) of the indicated double-stranded oligonucleotides. Data are expressed as percent induction with respect to the induction of the wild type promoter, which was set at 100%, and are the mean ± S.D. The expression values of noninduced control cells were at 10%± 4 (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Recently it has been reported that there is a bifurcation of the mitogenic signals downstream of Ras toward Raf-1 and λ/ιPKC (Sanz et al., 27Sanz L.

Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21299-21306Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of these kinases in the induction of each transcriptional unit, different stromelysin-1 gene promoter constructs were transfected with wild type Ras and either a Raf-1 or a λ/ιPKC dominant negative mutant (Fig. 5). The expression of the dominant negative Raf-1 abolished Ras induction of the SPREmut construct but did not affect induction of the PEA3mut one, indicating that Raf-1 is an intermediate step in the activation of the stromelysin-1 gene through the PEA3-AP-1 unit. In contrast, the expression of the dominant negative λ/ιPKC significantly reduced gene expression through the SPRE-AP-1 unit, whereas that through PEA3-AP-1 was not affected. When assaying the wild type promoter construct, the expression of the Raf-1 mutant reduced the induction by Ras to levels consistent with those expected from individual mutant studies. However, expression of the λ/ιPKC mutant reduced Ras induction of the wild type promoter construct to approximately 40% of total activity, suggesting that λ/ιPKC is controlling stromelysin-1 gene expression through additional mechanisms other than those operating on the SPRE-AP-1 unit. The previously recognized synergism between PEA3 and AP-1 sites in the transcriptional activation of specific genes (Wasylyk et al., 30Wasylyk C. Flores P. Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3371-3378Google Scholar, 31Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D.

To investigate whether a physical association between the corresponding transcription factors could also occur during transcriptional activation through SPRE, we used specific antibodies to determine the presence of SPBP and AP-1 proteins in the nuclear complexes associated with SPRE (Fig. 6A). Incubation of serum-activated nuclear extracts with anti-Jun caused a characteristic supershift of the retarded band, whereas the presence of anti-Fos produced little or no effect, suggesting that Jun proteins but not Fos are critical components of the SPRE-binding nuclear complex. In parallel control studies using oligonucleotides representing the AP-1 site, both anti-Fos and anti-Jun antibodies caused a characteristic supershift consistent with the known composition of the AP-1 complex (not shown). Consistent with previous data (Sanz et al., 28Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Google Scholar) incubation of nuclear extracts with anti-SPBP dramatically inhibited the SPRE nuclear binding activity. Similar results were obtained when using PDGF-activated nuclear extracts (data not shown). Further analysis using antibodies specific for different Jun proteins indicates that c-Jun is most likely the factor present in the SPRE-binding nuclear complex (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that a physical interaction between SPBP and c-Jun occurs. To assess this further, we incubated in vitro translated SPBP and bacterial recombinant GST-c-Jun or GST-c-Fos proteins, in an attempt to determine whether these proteins can associate directly with SPBP in vitro. Consistent with the data depicted in Fig. 6A, SPBP specifically associated with bacterial expressed GST-c-Jun but not with GST-c-Fos (Fig. 6B) or with GST alone (not shown). Collectively, these results indicate the existence of a cross-coupling between c-Jun and SPBP. To evaluate the functional significance of SPBP-c-Jun interaction, we performed specific transactivation studies of a minimal promoter construct under SPRE control (Fig. 7). The transient expression of increasing amounts of SPBP in the transfected fibroblasts resulted in a strong transactivation of this construct with a sigmoidal profile, suggesting that SPBP can transactivate this element through a cooperative process (panel A). Similarly, transient expression of c-Jun also transactivated the SPRE-controlled promoter, although the induction was much more limited than with SPBP (panel B, circles). To investigate whether these transcription factors can in fact cooperate in this specific transactivation, we expressed suboptimal levels of SPBP (1 µg) along with variable amounts of c-Jun (panel B, squares). In these conditions, expression of c-Jun strongly induced gene reporter expression, indicating that SPBP and c-Jun can in fact cooperate and elicit a synergistic action in the transactivation of the SPRE site. Transient gene expression assays are valuable tools to understand gene transcription despite their limited scope when extrapolating these results to the native environment, mainly due to the inherent difficulty in defining the precise DNA regions involved in the transcriptional regulation of a specific eukaryotic gene. Nevertheless, because promoters often contain regulatory elements within a few hundred nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site, functional studies usually are performed with relatively small promoters. However, because recent studies demonstrate the existence of DNA elements specifically responding to mitogenic signals far upstream in the human stromelysin-1 promoter (Diaz-Meco et al., 11Diaz-Meco M.T. Quiñones S. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Bernal D. Saus J. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22597-22602Google Scholar; Sanz et al., 27Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dominguez I. Lozano J. Johansen T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10044-10049Google Scholar), we used a large (−2311) promoter construct derived from the human gene (XXB1) to study stromelysin-1 gene expression in response to PDGF and Ras. PDGF induces transient expression of the −2311 promoter similarly to the extent that it induces the endogenous gene in cultured human fibroblasts (data not shown), suggesting that this promoter fragment contains the bulk of the regulatory elements involved in PDGF induction. By using different stromelysin-1 promoter fragments from various species, four major regulatory elements and the corresponding transcription factors have been characterized, and the existence of additional elements has been suggested (Kerr et al., 16Kerr L.D. Holt J.T. Matrisian L.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1424-1427Google Scholar, 17Kerr L.D. Miller D.B. Matrisian L.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 267-278Google Scholar; Wasylyk et al., 32Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Google Scholar; Sanz et al., 27Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dominguez I. Lozano J. Johansen T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol.

Kurkinen M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 471-477Google Scholar). Specifically, these elements are in proximal to distal order: AP-1 site, PEA3 site, TIE (for transforming growth factor-β1 inhibitory element), and SPRE. With the exception of TIE, a negative element that responds to transforming growth factor-β1 characterized in the rat gene promoter, the other three elements exist in the −2311 promoter fragment of the human stromelysin-1 gene and have been implicated independently in the transcriptional induction of the stromelysin-1 gene in response to mitogenic stimuli (Kerr et al., 16Kerr L.D. Holt J.T. Matrisian L.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1424-1427Google Scholar; Wasylyk et al., 32Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Google Scholar; Sanz et al., 27Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dominguez I. Lozano J. Johansen T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10044-10049Google Scholar). Consistently, minimal sequences representing these individual elements can drive the expression of a minimal heterologous promoter in response to PDGF or Ras. These individual responses were notably different in the context of a more “native” promoter construct (XXB1), although the differences were not evident when assaying specific 5′ deletion clones thereof (data not shown) or the inversion mutant HB1 (Diaz-Meco et al., 11Diaz-Meco M.T. Quiñones S. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Bernal D. Saus J. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22597-22602Google Scholar). This indicates that the stromelysin-1 gene promoter structure is more critical than element-flanking regions to integrate the control of individual responsive elements in the native environment and that large native-like promoter constructs are required to authenticate gene regulation mechanisms experimentally. This may explain why Wasylyk et al. did not observe synergism between the PEA3-cassette and AP-1 site in the rat stromelysin-1 gene promoter in contrast to their pioneer findings showing such element cooperation in other promoters (Wasylyk et al., 31Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Google Scholar; Gutman and Wasylyk, 14Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have found that the PEA3-AP-1 unit is indeed disrupted in a −255 to −11 promoter construct in which both elements are present (data not shown). Our functional studies using minimal XXB1 mutants in which one of the two functional transcriptional units are preserved, strongly suggest the existence of two independent transcriptional units, one positively controlled by λ/ιPKC and the other by Raf-1, two downstream intermediates of the mitogenic PDGF/Ras cascade thought to be located in different branches. It was also determined that the PEA3-AP-1 unit under Raf-1 control contributes to approximately 60% of the total activity, whereas the SPRE-AP-1 unit accounts for the remaining 40%. This is supported by competition studies using the XXB1 construct and double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the active DNA elements. However, even though the data indicate that λ/ιPKC is involved in the induction of stromelysin-1 gene through the SPRE-AP-1 unit, the expression of a dominant negative mutant of λ/ιPKC resulted in an unexpectedly strong inhibition of Ras-induced activity when both transcription units were functional, suggesting that the kinase is involved in additional positive control(s) other than the regulation of the SPRE-AP-1 unit and that such control only operates when the transcriptional complex is fully assembled and thus able to influence PEA3-AP-1 activity. Studies using 5′ deletion clones of XXB1 have revealed the presence of a negative regulatory sequence immediately 5′ of the PEA3 site which plays a central role in the human stromelysin-1 gene transcription in response to PDGF. 3M. Kirstein and J. Saus, unpublished results. The presence of this negative regulatory element has been reported previously by us and others in similar studies using human or rat promoter constructs in response to other mitogens and cytokines (Wasylyk et al., 32Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Google Scholar; Quinones et al., 26Quinones S. Buttice G. Kurkinen M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 471-477Google Scholar). λ/ιPKC could conceivably be exerting a second positive control by causing a release of the negative transcription machinery, thereby positively influencing transcription. The existence of crucial negative controls governing human stromelysin-1 gene expression was suggested previously by the demonstration that protein synthesis inhibitors strongly induced its transcription (Otani et al., 24Otani Y. Quinones S. Saus J. Kurkinen M. Harris Jr., E.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 75-79Google Scholar). Very recently, a direct physical association has been reported between Ets and AP-1 transcription factors to form a trimolecular protein complex that transactivates enhancer elements containing PEA3 and AP-1 sites (Bassuk and Leiden, 3Bassuk A.G. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 223-237Google Scholar). In the same report, the authors show that the interaction occurs between the DNA binding domains of Ets and Jun. It is known that a single PEA3 site is not sufficient for Ets induction and that target genes for the trimolecular Ets-AP-1 complex contain a single PEA3 site either nearby or adjacent to an AP-1 site (Wasylyk et al., 31Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Google Scholar; Gutman and Wasylyk, 14Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Google Scholar; Bassuk and Leiden, 3Bassuk A.G. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 223-237Google Scholar). Thus it appears that this structural arrangement, allowing simultaneous DNA binding and transcription factor interaction, is required for Ets induction. The stromelysin-1 gene contains two PEA3 sites forming a palindromic cassette that is sufficient for Ets induction and is distanced more than 100 nucleotides from the AP-1 site. Therefore it is not evident how similar interactions might occur to activate the PEA3-AP-1 unit. Additional factors might be necessary to permit these elements to associate in a ternary complex. Consistent with this, specific XXB1 deletion clones demonstrate the lack of cooperation between these elements.3 SPBP is sufficient to transactivate a minimal promoter driven by SPRE. These transactivations exhibit cooperative profiles suggesting that SPBP oligomers are needed for induction. In contrast, c-Jun caused limited transactivation, and cooperation with other endogenous factors appears to be required for induction. Consistently, c-Jun efficiently induced minimal promoters when coexpressed with suboptimal SPBP levels, demonstrating a synergistic effect of SPBP and c-Jun. This and the hyperbolic profiles of these transactivations with respect to the levels of c-Jun suggest that SPBP and c-Jun aggregate to generate a transcription factor that binds the SPRE site with more affinity than SPBP oligomers. Accordingly, SPBP and c-Jun are both present in the transcriptional complex bound to the SPRE site and produce aggregates efficiently in vitro. It is premature to postulate that such interactions mediate the cooperation observed between AP-1 and SPRE sites in the context of the full promoter. However, because SPBP is unusually large and the putative DNA binding and leucine zipper domains are far apart in the polypeptide chain (Sanz et al., 28Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Google Scholar), a single SPBP-Jun aggregate might be able to contact both the SPRE and AP-1 sites and to induce transcription. Alternatively, if SPBP does not interact with the c-Jun leucine zipper, c-Jun could be the center of a trimolecular transcription factor, SPBP-Jun-Fos, which links the SPRE and AP-1 sites and results in the observed transcriptional induction.

One of these, TFIID, was shown to act through the TATA box, a ubiquitous class II core promoter element required for stable preinitiation complex formation (6Davison B.L. Egly J.-M. Mulvhill E.R. Chambon P. Nature. 1983; 301: 680-686Google Scholar, 7Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Google Scholar, 8Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Google Scholar). Early characterization of the human TFIID-core promoter interactions revealed a remarkably large footprint on the adenovirus major late core promoter (Ad2 MLP) extending from −47 to +35 and covering both TATA box and the transcription initiation site (7Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Google Scholar). On other, weaker promoters, however, the human TFIID-DNA interactions were found to be restricted to the TATA box, thus suggesting multiple modes of binding (8Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Google Scholar).Studies on the adenovirus E4 promoter revealed an interesting connection between the alternative footprinting patterns: activators bound upstream of the TATA element induce the downstream extension of the footprint of prebound TFIID, which in turn correlates with increased recruitment of GTFs and activated transcription (9Hai T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Green M. Cell. 1988; 54: 1043-1051Google Scholar, 10Horikoshi M. Hai T. Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 1033-1042Google Scholar, 11Horikoshi M. Carey M.F. Kakidani H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 665-669Google Scholar). These observations, as well as subsequent studies with affinity-purified TFIID (12Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Google Scholar), suggest that the TFIID-promoter complex is dynamic and capable of reversibly assuming at least two distinct conformations. Furthermore, direct interactions between TFIID and activators, first shown with USF on the Ad2 MLP (7Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Google Scholar), indicated a possible functional significance: namely, that activators binding to their cognate sites can modulate TFIID's interaction with DNA, thus increasing transcription initiation rates.The cloning of the TATA box-binding subunit, TBP, from several organisms allowed immunoaffinity purification and molecular characterization of TFIID (reviewed in 13Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Google Scholar). This has included the identification of evolutionary conserved TBP-associated factors (TAFs), including ≥13 in human TFIID, ≥9 in Drosophila, and ≥10 in yeast (reviewed in 14Goodrich J.A. Tjian R.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Google Scholar). Molecular characterization of purified TFIID and recombinant subunits have largely substantiated the notion that interactions between activators and specific TFIID subunits, including both TBP and individual TAFs, indeed have functional relevance (reviewed in 14Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 403-409Google Scholar and 15Hisatake K. Ohta T. Takada R. Guermah M. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8195-8199Google Scholar). Reconstituted partial TFIID complexes have provided direct evidence that distinct activators have differential TAF requirements (see 22Chen J.-L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Google Scholar and references therein).While activator-TFIID interactions may have a stabilizing effect on the preinitiation complex, little insight has been gained into the molecular mechanism of activation. Whether activators function by effecting enhanced TFIID recruitment to the promoter (12Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Google Scholar, 23Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Roeder R.G.

To gain insight into the mechanism of transcriptional regulation, attempts have been made to describe the structure of the TFIID complex in terms of protein interactions between its isolated components (see 27Kokubo T.

Thus the largest subunit (dTAF230/hTAF250) has been proposed to direct the assembly of other TAFs into a TFIID complex (30Takada R. Nakatani Y. Hoffmann A. Kokubo T. Hasegawa S. Roeder R.G.

Nature. 1993; 362: 511-517Google Scholar), but in the absence of appropriate analyses of native TFIID an understanding of the structural organization of this multiprotein complex both on and off the DNA remains elusive.In this study, we describe the cloning of hTAF20, the identification of hTAF15, and a detailed molecular characterization of their interactions within the TFIID complex. These results support and extend a novel model concerning the architecture of the TFIID complex.DISCUSSIONConcerted efforts over the last few years aimed at a molecular characterization of the general initiation factor TFIID have led to the identification of more than a dozen human polypeptide components and their preliminary biochemical characterization (16Burley S.K.

A. 1995; 92: 5788-5792Google Scholar, 40Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Google Scholar, 41Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L.

However, to elucidate the biochemical mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation and TFIID's role in this process, a complete characterization of the TFIID complex and its conformational states is imperative and mandates the identification of all of its components and characterization of their three-dimensional arrangement.Here we report the cloning of hTAF20, the identification of the related hTAF15 and an examination of their role(s) in the structural organization of the TFIID complex. Through sequential TFIID complex disruption experiments, we have presented the first experimental data on protein-protein interactions within native TFIID preparations. Our results indicate that TAF20/15 is associated with the TATA binding subunit, TBP, and the potential co-activator components TAF135 and TAF55. In vitro interaction assays with recombinant polypeptides confirmed these results and also demonstrated specific interactions of TAF20/15 with human TAF80, as well as a self-association. By means of a detailed mutagenesis analysis these interactions were mapped to discrete, though overlapping portions of a predicted secondary structure for TAF20/15 that may be used in a first attempt to model the architecture of the TFIID complex.Elsewhere we recently presented evidence for a histone octamer-like structure within TFIID that consists of TAF80, TAF31, and TAF20/15 and was based on weak, but structurally relevant sequence homologies of the TAFs to histones H4, H3, and H2B, respectively (39Hoffmann A. Chiang C.-M. Oelgeschläger T. Xie X. Burley S.K. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 356-359Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies have indeed demonstrated a histone-like heterotetrameric structure for the Drosophila TFIID homologs, dTAF62 and dTAF42, of histones H4 and H3 (43Xie X. Kokubo T. Cohen S.L. Mirza U.A. Hoffmann A. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Burley S.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 316-322Google Scholar). The results of our present studies on hTAF20/15 attain particular significance when discussed in the context of this structural motif within the TFIID complex.First, mutagenesis studies of TAF20/15 indicate that all protein interaction sites identified map to the C-terminal 109 residues which constitute the histone H2B homologous domain. These observations reflect the demonstration that this portion of TAF20/15 is sufficient for incorporation into a functional TFIID complex (39Hoffmann A. Chiang C.-M. Oelgeschläger T. Xie X. Burley S.K. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 356-359Google Scholar). Furthermore, considering the lack of sequence conservation of the C-terminal 20 residues in the putative maize homolog (Fig. 1B) and in archaebaterial H2B-like proteins (39Hoffmann A. Chiang C.-M. Oelgeschläger T. Xie X. Burley S.K. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 356-359Google Scholar), it appears that a minimal H2B-like fold is defined by helices A, B, and C. Our structure-function studies demonstrate that derivative proteins containing these helices are at least minimally capable of mediating all interactions tested in our in vitro assay (Fig. 4G). Portions of TAF20/15 shown to be involved in binding a particular TFIID component make up an interaction surface that, given the demonstrated histone homology, can be described by the H2B-like globular domain of TAF20/15 (Fig. 5A). Intra-TFIID interactions project on seemingly distinct surfaces in such a model for TAF20/15. Importantly, a self-association requiring the two central helices of the polypeptide is consistent with indications from crystallographic studies that dimerization of histones H2A and H2B involves corresponding domains (44Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.-C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Google Scholar). Similarly, interaction of TAF20 with TAF80 involves the H4-homologous domain of TAF80 (15Hisatake K. Ohta T. Takada R. Guermah M. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8195-8199Google Scholar) and portions of the three C-terminal helices of TAF20/15 as observed for the H4-H2B interactions in the histone octamer structure (44Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.-C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Google Scholar). By characterizing intra-TFIID protein interactions in detail the current results support the histone-octamer model for TAFs 80, 31, and 20/15.Second, it is noteworthy that multiple copies of TAF20/15 found within native TFIID, presumably two dimers (39Hoffmann A. Chiang C.-M. Oelgeschläger T. Xie X. Burley S.K. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 356-359Google Scholar), may help to accommodate the large number of observed interactions that impinge on a relatively small globular domain (Fig. 5A). These include associations of TAF20/15 with TBP, TAF80, TAF55, and TAF135 (this study), as well as interactions with the smaller TAF30, TAF28, and TAF18 components (29Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Google Scholar).Finally, a strong interaction between hTAF20/15 and TBP, which we have observed both in partially disrupted native TFIID preparations (Fig. 3D) and between recombinant polypeptides, may represent a primary link between the proposed histone octamer-like TAF complex and the TATA box binding subunit within TFIID. This view is supported by the apparent stability of a complex consisting of recombinant hTBP, hTAF20, hTAF31, and hTAF80. 3T. Ohta and R. G. Roeder, unpublished observations. Previously reported interactions between TBP, TAF250 (30Takada R. Nakatani Y. Hoffmann A. Kokubo T. Hasegawa S. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11809-11813Google Scholar, 31Weinzierl R.O.J. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 362: 511-517Google Scholar), and TAF80 (15Hisatake K. Ohta T. Takada R. Guermah M. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8195-8199Google Scholar) may increase the stability of this core complex, consistent with the ability to form complexes containing TBP, dTAF230/hTAF250, hTAF80/dTAF60, and hTAF31/dTAF40 (45Thut C.J. Chen J.-L. Klemm R. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 267: 100-104Google Scholar). 4M. Guermah and R. G. Roeder, unpublished results. High affinity interactions between TBP and TAF20/15 and the involvement of the latter in a presumptive histone octamer-like structure suggest an important qualification of previous models ascribing to dTAF230/hTAF250 the central role in directing assembly of the TFIID complex (30Takada R. Nakatani Y. Hoffmann A. Kokubo T. Hasegawa S. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11809-11813Google Scholar, 31Weinzierl R.O.J. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 362: 511-517Google Scholar). Thus, we may consider TBP bound to the histone octamer-like complex (consisting of TAF20/15, TAF31 and TAF80) as a minimal TFIID core complex with which other TAFs and possibly other co-activator proteins associate (Fig. 5B). However, based on previous interaction studies, the association of TAF55 (40Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Google Scholar), TAF95, 5M. Guermah, Y. Tao, and R. G. Roeder, unpublished results. and TAF135 (29Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Google Scholar, 31Weinzierl R.O.J. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1033-1046Google Scholar) with the TFIID complex may involve interaction surfaces on TAF250 as well as those in TAF20/15 proteins.The data presented in this report represent a first attempt to characterize the three-dimensional arrangement of the TFIID multiprotein complex. Utilizing detailed mutagenesis analyses of intracomplex interactions a recently proposed structural model (39Hoffmann A. Chiang C.-M. Oelgeschläger T. Xie X. Burley S.K. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 356-359Google Scholar) has been confirmed and extended to include other components of TFIID. Fig. 5B represents a diagrammatic attempt to give a comprehensive account of all currently available structural data of the human TFIID complex (16Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Google Scholar). Future biophysical studies of TAF interactions and subcomplexes promise to further our understanding of TFIID function in transcriptional regulation by way of insights into the structure and conformation of this multiprotein complex. INTRODUCTIONCell-free transcription systems capable of accurate transcription initiation on a promoter-containing plasmid template (1Weil P.A. Luse D.S. Segall J. Roeder R.G.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Google Scholar) (reviewed in 5Zawel Z. Reinberg D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 67-108Google Scholar). One of these, TFIID, was shown to act through the TATA box, a ubiquitous class II core promoter element required for stable preinitiation complex formation (6Davison B.L. Egly J.-M. Mulvhill E.R. Chambon P. Nature. 1983; 301: 680-686Google Scholar, 7Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Google Scholar, 8Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Google Scholar). Early characterization of the human TFIID-core promoter interactions revealed a remarkably large footprint on the adenovirus major late core promoter (Ad2 MLP) extending from −47 to +35 and covering both TATA box and the transcription initiation site (7Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Google Scholar). On other, weaker promoters, however, the human TFIID-DNA interactions were found to be restricted to the TATA box, thus suggesting multiple modes of binding (8Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Google Scholar).Studies on the adenovirus E4 promoter revealed an interesting connection between the alternative footprinting patterns: activators bound upstream of the TATA element induce the downstream extension of the footprint of prebound TFIID, which in turn correlates with increased recruitment of GTFs and activated transcription (9Hai T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Green M. Cell. 1988; 54: 1043-1051Google Scholar, 10Horikoshi M. Hai T. Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 1033-1042Google Scholar, 11Horikoshi M. Carey M.F. Kakidani H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 665-669Google Scholar). These observations, as well as subsequent studies with affinity-purified TFIID (12Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Google Scholar), suggest that the TFIID-promoter complex is dynamic and capable of reversibly assuming at least two distinct conformations. Furthermore, direct interactions between TFIID and activators, first shown with USF on the Ad2 MLP (7Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Google Scholar), indicated a possible functional significance: namely, that activators binding to their cognate sites can modulate TFIID's interaction with DNA, thus increasing transcription initiation rates.The cloning of the TATA box-binding subunit, TBP, from several organisms allowed immunoaffinity purification and molecular characterization of TFIID (reviewed in 13Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Google Scholar). This has included the identification of evolutionary conserved TBP-associated factors (TAFs), including ≥13 in human TFIID, ≥9 in Drosophila, and ≥10 in yeast (reviewed in 14Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 403-409Google Scholar, 15Hisatake K. Ohta T. Takada R. Guermah M. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Google Scholar), which are required, in addition to TBP, for co-activator function of TFIID (17Hoffmann A. Sinn E. Yamamoto T. Wang J. Roy A. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G.

Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2212-2224Google Scholar) and for activator-independent (basal) transcription from TATA-less promoters (21Martinez E. Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Google Scholar). Molecular characterization of purified TFIID and recombinant subunits have largely substantiated the notion that interactions between activators and specific TFIID subunits, including both TBP and individual TAFs, indeed have functional relevance (reviewed in 14Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 403-409Google Scholar and 15Hisatake K. Ohta T. Takada R. Guermah M. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8195-8199Google Scholar). Reconstituted partial TFIID complexes have provided direct evidence that distinct activators have differential TAF requirements (see 22Chen J.-L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Google Scholar and references therein).While activator-TFIID interactions may have a stabilizing effect on the preinitiation complex, little insight has been gained into the molecular mechanism of activation. Whether activators function by effecting enhanced TFIID recruitment to the promoter (12Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Google Scholar, 23Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Roeder R.G.

Cell. 1988; 55: 211-219Google Scholar) or qualitative changes in TFIID-DNA interactions that lead to enhanced downstream factor recruitment (10Horikoshi M. Hai T. Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 1033-1042Google Scholar, 11Horikoshi M. Carey M.F. Kakidani H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 665-669Google Scholar), possibly through direct TAF-GTF interactions (15Hisatake K. Ohta T.

To gain insight into the mechanism of transcriptional regulation, attempts have been made to describe the structure of the TFIID complex in terms of protein interactions between its isolated components (see 27Kokubo T. Gong D.-W. Yamashita S. Takada R. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7859-7863Google Scholar, 28Yokomori K. Chen J.-L. Admon A. Zhou S. Tjian R.

Thus the largest subunit (dTAF230/hTAF250) has been proposed to direct the assembly of other TAFs into a TFIID complex (30Takada R. Nakatani Y. Hoffmann A. Kokubo T. Hasegawa S. Roeder R.G.

Nature. 1993; 362: 511-517Google Scholar), but in the absence of appropriate analyses of native TFIID an understanding of the structural organization of this multiprotein complex both on and off the DNA remains elusive.In this study, we describe the cloning of hTAF20, the identification of hTAF15, and a detailed molecular characterization of their interactions within the TFIID complex. These results support and extend a novel model concerning the architecture of the TFIID complex.

INTRODUCTIONInositol, a six-carbon cyclitol, is an essential component of eukaryotic cells. Its metabolism is an important concern in many agricultural and clinical disciplines. Inositol phosphates convey signals for a wide variety of hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters (1Hokin L.E. Annu. Rev.

To this end, we have begun developmental studies of the genes and gene products of the pivotal biosynthetic enzyme, MI-1-P synthase, using the well characterized developmental biology of the green bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, and the molecular and classic genetics available in Arabidopsis thaliana.This article reports intriguing findings concerning the temporal and spatial expression of MI-1-P synthase during development of P. vulgaris.DISCUSSIONOur biochemical analyses of the developmental regulation of MI-1-P synthase expression in the green bean establish, for the first time, the foundation needed to genetically dissect the regulation of inositol metabolism in a higher plant. Phaseolus provides a useful model system in which to study, at the molecular level, the regulation of inositol biosynthesis during plant growth and development. Embryonic and postgerminative development of organs proceed along a predictable pathway. Furthermore, all stages of development provide ample experimental material for biochemical analyses.Although we observed no cross-reacting material when soluble leaf proteins were analyzed by Western blotting, synthase activity in the ammonium sulfate-saturated precipitates of leaf proteins clearly pointed to its presence in leaves. Western analyses of the precipitates showed that the 33-kDa form of the enzyme was indeed located in the leaves. Subsequent isolation and fractionation of Phaseolus leaf chloroplasts localized the 33-kDa form of the enzyme to the thylakoids, confirming previous reports of MI-1-P synthase activity associated with these organelles. We also, surprisingly, identified a very large cross-reacting protein or protein complex (approximately 80 kDa) with MI-1-P synthase activity, which localized to the chloroplast envelope and stroma. This protein could represent an active precursor, since most proteins targeted to the thylakoids are synthesized outside of the chloroplasts as larger molecular size precursors and processed to their mature size during transport (35Viitanen P.V. Doran E.R. Dunsmuir P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15000-15007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lamppa G.K. J. Biol.

Routine Western analyses and ammonium sulfate fractionation cannot detect this protein.The developmental profile for the expression of MI-1-P synthase in Phaseolus is striking. Expression and associated activity appears at two crucial stages (stages II and IV) during seed maturation. During these stages, two important transient organs, the suspensor (stage II) and cotyledons (stage IV), are formed. Given the postulated functions for the angiosperm suspensor (anchor and/or major route of nutrients into the embryo), it will be of great interest to determine the subcellular localization of MI-1-P synthase (inositol biosynthesis) during this stage of embryogenesis. More importantly, we can now begin to investigate the role of inositol in the developing embryo and/or suspensor. It will also be informative to localize inositol biosynthesis in embryonic and postembryonic cotyledons and to compare the site of inositol synthesis with that of phytic acid (a hexakisphosphoric acid ester of myo-inositol that serves as a major phosphate reserve for the seed).Our working hypothesis based on the data presented and the probability that inositol cannot traverse the plastid membrane (38Wang C.T. Nobel P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 241: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is that: 1) MI-1-P synthase (de novo biosynthesis of inositol) in Phaseolus is localized to plastids in different organs (roots, leaves, suspensor and/or embryo, and cotyledons); and 2) different forms of the enzyme at different stages of development reflect regulatory controls at the transcriptional and translational levels. Support for this hypothesis comes from preliminary Northern analyses, the recent cloning and sequencing of a root cDNA encoding a protein with MI-1-P synthase activity (39Wang X. Johnson M.D. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 110: 336Google Scholar), the recent isolation of a Phaseolus leaf cDNA clone, 2M. D. Johnson and X. Wang, unpublished data. and the presence of an inositol transport system in plants (18Loewus F.A. Boss W.F. Morré D.J. Loewus F.A. Inositol Metabolism in Plants. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1990: 13Google Scholar).Developmental studies of inositol biosynthesis in Arabidopsis and the isolation of a second Arabidopsis cDNA with MI-1-P synthase activity (31Johnson M.D. Sussex I.M.

(Bethesda). 1994; 105: 1023-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) also suggest that transcriptional and translational mechanisms operate to regulate the temporal and spatial expression of MI-1-P synthase in Arabidopsis.These recent findings and the infinite questions and possibilities raised concerning the genetic regulation of inositol biosynthesis in higher plants propel us into the exciting area of chloroplast (plastid) molecular biology. Future experiments, among many, will address the mechanics of translocation of MI-1-P synthase into the chloroplast. INTRODUCTIONInositol, a six-carbon cyclitol, is an essential component of eukaryotic cells. Its metabolism is an important concern in many agricultural and clinical disciplines. Inositol phosphates convey signals for a wide variety of hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters (1Hokin L.E. Annu. Rev.

J. 1993; 288: 697-712Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar).Inositol 1-phosphate, the immediate precursor of free inositol, is synthesized via an internal cyclization of glucose 6-phosphate (5Eisenberg F.

These observations raise the possibility that p300 may function as a bridging factor between E1A and cellular transcription factors. Here we show that p300, but not a mutant defective for binding to E1A, activated cAMP-responsive element-binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) binding site-mediated transcription in the presence of E1A. Among proteins that can recognize the CREB/ATF site, CREB appeared to be modulated by E1A in a p300 binding-dependent manner. This effect of E1A was correlated with a specific physical interaction between CREB and p300. These results suggest that p300 plays a crucial role in mediating the functional interplay between E1A and certain members of the CREB/ATF family. Two separate domains within p300 were identified that are capable of activating transcription. One of the domains interacted with the basal factor TFIIB, suggesting that p300 may function as a coactivator by making contacts with both sequence-specific transcription factors and the basal transcriptional machinery.

The E1A region of human adenoviruses gives rise to two major alternatively spliced products, 12 S and 13 S mRNAs (1Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Lewis J.B. J. Mol.

The corresponding protein products are nuclear phosphoproteins of 243 and 289 amino acids, respectively (3Perricaudet M. Akusjarvi G. Virtanen A. Pettersson U.

Both polypeptides have identical amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends, the only difference being a region of 46 internal amino acids unique to the 13 S product (3Perricaudet M. Akusjarvi G. Virtanen A.

Cell. 1980; 21: 303-313Google Scholar, 8Nevins J.R. Cell. 1981; 26: 213-220Google Scholar). In addition to activating transcription of other adenoviral genes, E1A affects a whole array of host cell functions such as DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression (9Kaczmarek L. Ferguson B. Rosenberg M. Baserga R. Virology. 1986; 152: 1-10Google Scholar, 10Stabel S. Argos P. Philipson L. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2329-2336Google Scholar) to facilitate viral replication and propagation. E1A is also capable of immortalizing cells (11van der Eb A.J. van Ormondt H. Schrier P.I. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Virology. 1980; 105: 537-550Google Scholar), inducing full morphological transformation in cooperation with several oncogenes including the ras, polyoma middle T, and adenovirus E1B (13van der Elsen P. de Parter S.

Muscat G.E.O. Kedes L. Nature. 1988; 344: 260-262Google Scholar). The diverse biological activities of E1A are attributable, at least in part, to its ability to modulate the cellular transcriptional machinery, since E1A has been shown to activate and repress a large number of cellular genes important for cell proliferation and differentiation (17Webster K.A.

Biol. 1992; 12: 4391-4399Google Scholar). Unlike conventional transcription factors, E1A does not recognize specific DNA sequences (5Ferguson B. Krippl B. Andrisani O. Jones N. Westphal H. Rosenberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2653-2661Google Scholar, 28Chatterjee P.K. Bruner M. Flint S.J. Harter M.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 835-841Google Scholar), and the E1A-responsive promoters do not share common sequence elements (reviewed in 29Flint S.J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 141-161Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that E1A must exert its transcriptional effects via multiple mechanisms that are likely to involve protein/protein interactions (29Flint S.J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 141-161Google Scholar). Studies in the past several years have provided evidence that supports such an hypothesis. It has been shown that in some cases, a direct interaction between E1A and certain transcription factors targets E1A to the promoters for transcriptional activation (30Lee W.S. Kao C.C. Bryant G.O. Liu X. Berk A.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 365-376Google Scholar, 31Horikoshi N. Maguire K. Krelli A. Maldanado E. Reinberg D. Weinmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In other cases, the interaction appears indirect and is mediated by E1A-associated proteins, such as the RB family of proteins. Through its physical interactions with RB, E1A disrupts the RB·E2F complex (35Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1990; 62: 659-669Google Scholar), releasing free, active form of E2F for transcriptional activation (reviewed in 36Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Google Scholar). Another protein that has been implicated in mediating the transcriptional effect of E1A is its associated protein p300 (37Yee S.P. Branton P.E. Virology. 1985; 147: 142-153Google Scholar, 38Harlow E. Whyte P. Franza Jr., B.R. Schely C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1579-1589Google Scholar). Genetic studies suggested that the ability of E1A to repress viral and cellular enhancers is dependent on the p300-binding domain of E1A (18Borrelli E. Hen R. Chambon P.

The cDNA that encodes the p300 protein was cloned, and direct evidence was obtained that demonstrated the involvement of p300 in E1A-mediated repression of the SV40 enhancer (42Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Google Scholar).

As predicted from the sequence comparison, p300 functions like CBP as a coactivator of CREB and is capable of mediating the effect of E1A on CREB (46Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Google Scholar, 47Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Google Scholar). Recently, by analyzing the ability of E1A and its mutant derivatives to convert the transcription factor YY1 from a repressor to an activator, we identified p300 as a bridging factor that mediates the functional interaction between YY1 and E1A (48Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Google Scholar). CREB binding protein cAMP-responsive element-binding protein activating transcription factor chloramphenicol amino acid(s) glutathione S-transferase protein kinase A. The observation that p300 mediates the ability of E1A to modulate YY1 activity led us to ask whether p300 is a common cofactor that mediates the transcriptional effects of E1A. Promoter elements that were previously shown to respond to E1A were examined. One of the cis elements through which E1A exerts its transcriptional effects is the recognition sequence for the CREB/ATF family of proteins (49Lee K.A.W. Hai T.-Y. SivaRaman L. Thimmappaya B. Hurst H.C. Jones N.C. Grenn M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8355-8359Google Scholar, 50Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3396-3400Google Scholar). The consensus sequence of the CREB/ATF binding sites can serve as a recognition site for either homo- or heterodimers between members of the CREB/ATF and the AP-1 family of transcription factors (51Hai T. Liu F. Allegretto E.A. Karin M. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1216-1226Google Scholar, 52Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Google Scholar). One of the ATF family members, ATF2, has been shown previously to mediate E1A-induced transcriptional activation via a direct interaction with E1A (32Liu F. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 520-525Google Scholar). In this paper, evidence is presented that p300 is involved in mediating the E1A-induced transcriptional activation via an ATF site (abbreviated as ATFf hereafter) taken from the fibronectin promoter (53Dean D.C. Bowlus C.L. Bourgeois S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1876-1880Google Scholar, 57Weintraub S. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 512-517Google Scholar). In contrast, p300 failed to activate transcription via an Sp1 site in the presence of E1A. By gel shift/antibody supershift experiments, two CREB/ATF family members, CREB and ATF-1, were found to bind the ATFf site. Using a GAL4 fusion protein-based assay, CREB, but not ATF-1 or Sp1, was shown to respond to E1A in a p300 binding-dependent manner. This suggests that CREB, but not ATF-1, participates in the response of the ATFf site to p300/E1A-induced transcriptional activation. Consistent with this hypothesis, CREB, but not ATF-1 or Sp1, was shown to physically interact with p300 in HeLa cells. Interestingly, E1A activated CREB-mediated transcription in HeLa cells but repressed it in U2OS cells. The activation and repression functions of E1A on CREB-dependent transcription in different cells both required an intact p300 binding domain. To better understand the role of p300 as a cofactor of CREB-mediated transcription, experiments were initiated to analyze how p300 regulates transcription. Two separate domains of p300 were identified that activated transcription when targeted to a promoter via the heterologous GAL4 DNA-binding domain. One of these activation domains was shown to interact with the basal transcription factor TFIIB. These results suggest that p300 may function as a coactivator by making contacts with both sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery. Cells were grown on 10-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (HeLa) or fetal calf serum (293 and U2OS). Transfections were performed by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method as described (54Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA was adjusted to be identical for each set of transfections. Cells were harvested 48 h after addition of the precipitates. All transfection assays were carried out with at least two independent DNA preparations and were repeated at least three times. Whole cell extracts were prepared from the transfected cells. CAT activity was assayed as described (54Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Google Scholar) and quantitated with a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. To ensure that CAT assays were performed within linear range, the proper amount of cell extracts was used to measure CAT activity. For instance, less extracts from cells transfected with stronger transactivators, such as GAL4-VP16 or GAL4-Sp1, were used for CAT reactions. For all the data presented, at least three independent transfections and CAT assays have been performed. pATF-TA-CAT, pSp1-TA-CAT, pTA-CAT, and pTATAA-CAT are kind gifts of D.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Google Scholar). pGAL4-p300 aa 1257-2414 was constructed by fusing a BglII/KpnI fragment from a pBluescript plasmid containing full-length p300 cDNA (42Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Google Scholar). The same region was taken from the p300 mutant dl10 (48Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Google Scholar) and cloned into pSG424. pGAL4-CREB is a gift of J. Licht (Mt. Sinai Medical School). pGAL4-ATF1 and -ATF2 are kind gifts of M. Green (University of Massachusetts Medical Center). pGAL4-Sp1 was provided by R. Tjian (University of California, Berkeley). E1A expression plasmids and the mutant derivatives were described previously (48Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Google Scholar) as were pGAL4-YY1 and pGAL4-E1BCAT (54Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Google Scholar). p300-VP16 was cloned into the RC/CMV expression vector (Invitrogen) with the activation domain of VP16 inserted into the NheI site (aa 2377) of p300 cDNA. pGST-p300 aa 1-596, aa 744-1571, and aa 1572-2414 were described before (48Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Google Scholar). pGAL4-Np300 (aa 1-596) and pGAL4-Mp300 (aa 744-1571) were constructed by cloning the p300 coding regions from the respective GST constructs into pSG424. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 293 cells as described (56Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). The sequences of ATFf (57Weintraub S. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 512-517Google Scholar) and YY1 binding site (AAV P5 +1 site, 54Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Google Scholar) were described before. A typical binding reaction mixture contained labeled oligonucleotides (ATFf, 7 × 104 cpm; or YY1 binding site, 4 × 104 cpm), 1 µg of poly(dI-dC), 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 30 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 8 µg of nuclear extracts in a final volume of 15 µl. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and analyzed by 4% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specificity of the protein-DNA complexes was demonstrated by competition using unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides. To identify individual transcription factors involved in the complex formation, various antibodies were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 4 h at 4°C before the addition of the probes. The results were visualized by autoradiography. Dr. M.-E. Lee (Harvard School of Public Health) kindly provided us with antibodies including α-ATF1 (C41-5.1, Santa Cruz, catalog sc-243), α-ATF2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., UBI, catalog 06-326), α-CREB (UBI, catalog 06-244), and α-c-Jun (UBI, catalog 06-115). The α-YY1 polyclonal antibodies are affinity-purified. GST fusion proteins were induced and purified as described (58Lee J.-S. See R.H. Galvin K.M. Wang J. Shi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 925-931Google Scholar). TFIIB proteins were 35S-labeled and synthesized by in vitro translation reactions using the TNT kit (Promega). Labeled proteins were incubated for 2 h with various GST-p300 fusion proteins coupled to glutathione agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were washed five times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline, and protein complexes were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Previously, we demonstrated that p300 activates YY1 binding site-mediated transcription in 293 cells (which constitutively express E1A proteins) and that this function is dependent on the ability of p300 to interact with both YY1 and E1A (48Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Google Scholar). Together with several other lines of evidence, we proposed that p300 mediated the modulatory effects of E1A on the transcriptional activity of YY1 (48Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Google Scholar). We then wished to determine whether p300 is a general mediator of the transcriptional effects of E1A. Since a number of transcription factor binding sites have been demonstrated to mediate E1A responsiveness (reviewed in 29Flint S.J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 141-161Google Scholar), we first asked whether, in the presence of E1A, p300 is capable of activating transcription of the reporter constructs previously shown to respond to E1A. The reporter CAT plasmids contain either an ATF site (ATFf) which was taken from the fibronectin promoter (nucleotide −176 to −161, 59Dean D.C. Blakeley M.S. Newby R.F. Ghazal P. Hennighausen L. Bourgeois S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1498-1506Google Scholar) (pATF-TA-CAT) or an Sp1 consensus sequence (pSp1-TA-CAT) at −40 relative to the start site of transcription (57Weintraub S. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 512-517Google Scholar, kind gifts of D. Dean). The parental vector pTA-CAT was derived from pTATAA-CAT which contains the fibronectin gene sequence from +8 to −36 (53Dean D.C. Bowlus C.L. Bourgeois S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1876-1880Google Scholar). pTA-CAT is essentially the same as pTATAA-CAT except that the TATA element extending from −20 to −24 of the fibronectin gene promoter (TATAA) was replaced by the simian virus 40 (SV40) early gene TATA box equivalent TATTTAT, which has been shown not to respond to E1A (60Simon M.C. Fisch T.M. Benecke B.J. Nevins J.R. Heintz N. Cell. 1988; 52: 723-729Google Scholar). It has been shown that all reporters except pTA-CAT responded to E1A in transfection assays (57Weintraub S. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 512-517Google Scholar). To determine whether the E1A response of these reporters may be mediated by p300, each reporter plasmid was cotransfected with a CMV-p300 expression plasmid into 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, p300 selectively activated CAT expression from pATF-TA-CAT but not from the parental vector pTA-CAT (lanes 1-2, and 7-8), suggesting that the ATFf site may be responsible for the p300-induced activation. Importantly, the p300 mutant, p300 dl10, which is deleted of the E1A-binding domain (42Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Google Scholar, 48Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Google Scholar) was unable to activate the ATFf site-mediated transcription (Fig. 1A, lane 3). The result indicated that the interaction between p300 and E1A is critical for the observed transcriptional activation. This is consistent with the observation that, in HeLa and U2OS cells which do not express E1A proteins, overexpression of p300 had little effect on the activity of pATF-TA-CAT under the same assay condition (data not shown). These results supported the hypothesis that p300 is involved in mediating E1A-induced transcriptional activation through the ATFf site. Consistent with this notion, without the ATFf site, the parental vector pTA-CAT did not respond to E1A (57Weintraub S. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 512-517Google Scholar) and also failed to respond to p300 in this assay (Fig. 1A, lane 8). Interestingly, p300 also did not activate the other two reporters, pSp1-TA-CAT and pTATAA-CAT (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 11), which previously were shown to respond to E1A (57Weintraub S. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 512-517Google Scholar). These results suggest that E1A transactivates these reporters through alternative mechanisms that do not involve the p300 protein. In the case of pTATAA-CAT, it is likely that E1A, in particular the 13 S gene product, may activate the reporter by directly targeting the basal transcription factor TATA-binding protein (30Lee W.S. Kao C.C. Bryant G.O. Liu X. Berk A.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 365-376Google Scholar, 31Horikoshi N. Maguire K. Krelli A. Maldanado E. Reinberg D. Weinmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5124-5128Google Scholar). How does p300 activate transcription through the ATFf site in 293 cells? Previously, it has been shown that p300 has specific DNA binding activity for NF-kB/H2TF1-like sites (61Rikitake Y. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2826-2836Google Scholar), which bear no resemblance to the YY1 (48Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Google Scholar) or the ATFf site (this study) shown to respond to p300. In fact, accumulating evidence suggests that p300 may function in a more indirect way, i.e. as a transcriptional cofactor (42Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Google Scholar, 46Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Google Scholar, 47Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Google Scholar). If this property of p300 is indeed the mechanism by which p300 activates transcription, the failure of p300 dl10 to activate pATF-TA-CAT could also be due to a defect in its ability to function as a transcriptional coactivator. To address this issue, the ability of the carboxyl-terminal half of p300 (aa 1257-2414) and its mutant derivative containing the same internal deletion (aa 1679-1812) as p300 dl10 to regulate transcription was analyzed. The reporter plasmid pGAL4-E1BCAT contains five GAL4 DNA binding sites immediately upstream of the minimal adenovirus E1B promoter. pGAL4-E1BCAT has been widely used for studies of transcriptional activation, including E1A-induced transcriptional activation. As shown in Fig. 1B, both forms of p300, when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, activated transcription of the target gene GAL4-E1BCAT, whereas the GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone had virtually no effects (data not shown, Fig. 5). These data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal half of p300 may contain a functional domain for its transcriptional coactivator function, which is unaffected by the dl10 deletion mutation. Thus, the failure of p300 dl10 to activate pATF-TA-CAT in 293 cells is most likely due to its inability to interact with E1A. However, it is unclear at the present time why the p300 dl10 activated transcription better than the wild-type p300. Taken together, these results demonstrated that p300 is capable of mediating E1A-induced transcriptional activation via the ATFf but not the Sp1 site. Since multiple CREB/ATF-related proteins can bind an ATF consensus site, we wished to determine which members of the CREB/ATF family bind the ATFf site that responded to p300 to activate transcription in 293 cells (Fig. 1A). An oligonucleotide representing the ATFf site was labeled with 32P and used in gel shift assays. As shown in Fig. 2, when the ATFf oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from 293 cells, two predominant complexes (labeled as A and B) were formed that were competed by molar excess of unlabeled ATFf but not by an unrelated YY1 oligonucleotide (lanes 1-7). Addition of α-ATF1 antibodies supershifted both the A and the B complexes whereas the α-CREB antibody supershifted only the A complex (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 10). This suggests that the A and B complexes both contain ATF-1 while only the A complex contains CREB. In contrast, addition of α-ATF2, α-c-Jun, and α-YY1 antibodies had no effect on either the A or the B complexes (Fig. 2, lanes 9, 11, and 12). As a control, only α-YY1 antibodies abolished a YY1 complex (Fig. 2, lower panel, lane 12). Taken together, these results suggest that ATF-1 and CREB are the main components of the DNA-protein complexes formed on the ATFf site in 293 cells. However, these data do not rule out the possibility that other untested ATFs may also bind the ATFf site. In addition, the results do not differentiate whether the A complex is composed of ATF-1/CREB heterodimers or comigrating ATF-1 and CREB homodimers. Since both ATF-1 and CREB, and possibly other untested ATFs may bind the ATFf site, it was important to determine which one (or both) is responsible for the response of the ATFf site to the E1A-induced transcriptional activation via p300 (Fig. 1A). To address this issue, individual ATF family members were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and assayed for their ability to respond to E1A using pGAL4-E1BCAT as a target plasmid (54Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, GAL4-CREB responded to E1A in a cell type-dependent manner. In U2OS cells, E1A, especially the 12 S gene product, repressed GAL4-CREB-mediated transcription (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 to 3). In contrast, in HeLa cells, 12 S E1A activated GAL4-CREB-mediated transcription (Fig. 3B, lane 4), albeit to a lesser extent compared with 13 S E1A (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). The quantitative difference between the effects of the 12 S and 13 S E1A is most likely attributable to the 46 amino acids (CR3) unique to the 13 S E1A, which is a known transcriptional activation domain (62Lillie J.W. Loewenstein P.M. Green M.R. Green M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1091-1100Google Scholar). With this activation domain, 13 S E1A is often found to be a more potent transactivator than the 12 S E1A (24Simon M.C.

Using differential mRNA display, we isolated a novel gene preferentially expressed in the rat aorta and termed this gene APEG-1. The cDNA of rat APEG-1 contained an open reading frame encoding 113 amino acids, which would predict a basic protein of 12.7 kDa. The amino acid sequence of rat APEG-1 was highly conserved among human and mouse homologues (97 and 98%, respectively). Using an APEG-1 fusion protein containing an N-terminal c-Myc tag, we identified APEG-1 as a nuclear protein. By in situ hybridization, APEG-1 mRNA was expressed in rat ASMC. Although APEG-1 was expressed highly in differentiated ASMC in vivo, its expression was quickly down-regulated and disappeared in dedifferentiated ASMC in culture. In vivo, APEG-1 mRNA levels decreased by more than 80% in response to vascular injury as ASMC changed from a quiescent to a proliferative phenotype. Taken together, these data indicate that APEG-1 is a novel marker for differentiated ASMC and may have a role in regulating growth and differentiation of this cell type.

INTRODUCTIONArterial smooth muscle cells (ASMC) 1The abbreviations used are: ASMCarterial smooth muscle cellsAPEG-1aortic preferentially expressed gene-1RT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis (hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. constitute the major portion of the blood vessel wall, and their main function is to regulate vascular tone. By controlling vascular tone, ASMC have an important role in regulating blood pressure. Fully differentiated ASMC in normal vessel walls proliferate at an extremely low rate and express unique contractile proteins, ion channels, and signaling molecules required for their contractile function (1Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). In contrast to skeletal and cardiac muscle cells (2Claycomb W.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1992; 2: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Parker T.G. Schneider M.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 179-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), ASMC are not terminally differentiated in adult animals. In response to vascular injuries caused by smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hyperhomocystenemia, hypertension, or trauma (such as balloon angioplasty), ASMC dedifferentiate and change from a quiescent and contractile phenotype to a proliferative and synthetic phenotype (1Owens G.K.

This proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells is one of the most prominent features of arteriosclerosis, the leading cause of death in developed countries (4Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9930) Google Scholar). Similar alterations in ASMC phenotypes occur during angiogenesis in solid tumors and may have an important role in determining the growth rate of these tumors (10Fidler I.J. Ellis L.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 185-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 11Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol.

Despite the importance of alteration of ASMC phenotypes in vascular diseases, little is known about molecular mechanisms regulating differentiation of this cell type (1Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). This is due, at least in part, to a lack of differentiation markers of ASMC.Several genes encoding proteins specific to smooth muscle cells, including smooth muscle α-actin, calponin, SM-22, and caldesmon, have been used as markers for differentiated smooth muscle cells (13Osbourn J.K.

However, their expression is not limited to vascular smooth muscle cells. Recently, a homeobox gene gax has been shown to be highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and may regulate their proliferation (19Gorski D.H. LePage D.F. Chandrashekhar P.V. Copelane N. Jenkins N.A. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3722-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20Gorski D.H. Walsh K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Yet, high level expression of gax has also been detected in the heart, indicating that gax is expressed both in smooth as well as striated muscles. To date, no marker specific to differentiated ASMC has been identified.To identify genes preferentially expressed in differentiated ASMC, we performed differential mRNA display using RNA samples extracted from different rat organs. Here we report the isolation of a novel gene, APEG-1, that is preferentially expressed in the rat ASMC in vivo. The amino acid sequence of APEG-1 is highly conserved among human, rat, and mouse homologues. Despite the absence of a classical nuclear localization signal, APEG-1 is a nuclear protein. APEG-1 is highly expressed in differentiated arterial smooth muscle cells in vivo. However, its expression is quickly down-regulated in cultured arterial smooth muscle cells during the first three passages. In vivo, APEG-1 mRNA levels decreased as ASMC changed from a quiescent to a proliferative phenotype in response to vascular injury, suggesting that APEG-1 may have a role in regulating the growth and differentiation of this cell type.DISCUSSIONUsing differential mRNA display, we have isolated a novel gene, APEG-1, that is preferentially expressed in ASMC. APEG-1 encodes a 12.7-kDa protein (Fig. 3). Its predicted protein sequence reveals an RGD domain and no known nuclear localization signals (33Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 32-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Since an RGD domain is the potential binding site for integrins, this finding would implicate APEG-1 as a membrane protein. However, c-Myc-tagged APEG-1 is localized to the nucleus (Fig. 5). This nuclear localization is not due to the c-Myc tag, because c-Myc-tagged cyclin B protein is expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm (data not shown), as reported previously (34Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 74: 979-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). An as yet unidentified nuclear localization signal may be responsible for its nuclear localization. Alternatively, APEG-1 may dimerize with another protein with a nuclear localization signal and then be transported to the nucleus.trans-Acting factors are nuclear proteins that have important roles in regulating proliferation and differentiation, as well as in determination of cell lineage. For example, members of the MyoD family are expressed only in skeletal muscle cells and define lineage, inhibit proliferation, and promote differentiation of this cell type (35Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 36Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 37Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of ASMC in regulating vascular tone and in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases, no ASMC-specific nuclear proteins have been identified (1Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). gax, a recently cloned homeobox gene, also encoding a nuclear protein, is expressed at high levels in both vascular smooth muscle and in striated muscle (19Gorski D.H. LePage D.F. Chandrashekhar P.V. Copelane N. Jenkins N.A. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3722-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast, APEG-1 mRNA is barely detectable in organs rich in striated muscle, such as the heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1, Fig. 2).

In this regard, it is interesting to point out that APEG-1 mRNA is expressed at low levels in organs rich in visceral smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, detection of high levels of APEG-1 mRNA in arterial tissue but not in venous tissue suggests that APEG-1 is indeed preferentially expressed in ASMC.Alteration in ASMC phenotypes has an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases and angiogenesis (1Owens G.K.

Despite high level expression of APEG-1 in differentiated ASMC in normal aorta, APEG-1 mRNA levels decreased rapidly and disappeared in dedifferentiated ASMC in culture even in early passage (Fig. 6). It has been shown that ASMC grown on Matrigel exhibit a more differentiated phenotype with a low proliferative index and enhanced levels of the smooth muscle isoform of α-actin (38Li X. Tsai P.

Thus, APEG-1 appears to be expressed only in highly differentiated ASMC in normal vessel walls and its down-regulation serves as a sensitive marker for dedifferentiated ASMC in vivo. This is further supported by our in vivo finding that APEG-1 mRNA levels in the carotid artery were markedly down-regulated to ∼18-20% of control after balloon injury when ASMC dedifferentiate (Fig. 7).Taken together, our data indicate that APEG-1 is a novel marker for differentiated ASMC. The immediate down-regulation of this nuclear protein by phenotypic change suggests that it may have a role in regulating growth and differentiation of this cell type. Further work aimed at cloning the APEG-1 gene and its 5′-flanking sequence will allow us to identify ASMC-specific cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that may prove useful for expressing foreign genes in the blood vessel wall. INTRODUCTIONArterial smooth muscle cells (ASMC) 1The abbreviations used are: ASMCarterial smooth muscle cellsAPEG-1aortic preferentially expressed gene-1RT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis (hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. constitute the major portion of the blood vessel wall, and their main function is to regulate vascular tone. By controlling vascular tone, ASMC have an important role in regulating blood pressure. Fully differentiated ASMC in normal vessel walls proliferate at an extremely low rate and express unique contractile proteins, ion channels, and signaling molecules required for their contractile function (1Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). In contrast to skeletal and cardiac muscle cells (2Claycomb W.C. Trends Cardiovasc.

In response to vascular injuries caused by smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hyperhomocystenemia, hypertension, or trauma (such as balloon angioplasty), ASMC dedifferentiate and change from a quiescent and contractile phenotype to a proliferative and synthetic phenotype (1Owens G.K.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9930) Google Scholar). Similar alterations in ASMC phenotypes occur during angiogenesis in solid tumors and may have an important role in determining the growth rate of these tumors (10Fidler I.J. Ellis L.M.

This is due, at least in part, to a lack of differentiation markers of ASMC.Several genes encoding proteins specific to smooth muscle cells, including smooth muscle α-actin, calponin, SM-22, and caldesmon, have been used as markers for differentiated smooth muscle cells (13Osbourn J.K.

However, their expression is not limited to vascular smooth muscle cells. Recently, a homeobox gene gax has been shown to be highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and may regulate their proliferation (19Gorski D.H. LePage D.F. Chandrashekhar P.V. Copelane N.

Yet, high level expression of gax has also been detected in the heart, indicating that gax is expressed both in smooth as well as striated muscles. To date, no marker specific to differentiated ASMC has been identified.To identify genes preferentially expressed in differentiated ASMC, we performed differential mRNA display using RNA samples extracted from different rat organs. Here we report the isolation of a novel gene, APEG-1, that is preferentially expressed in the rat ASMC in vivo. The amino acid sequence of APEG-1 is highly conserved among human, rat, and mouse homologues. Despite the absence of a classical nuclear localization signal, APEG-1 is a nuclear protein. APEG-1 is highly expressed in differentiated arterial smooth muscle cells in vivo. However, its expression is quickly down-regulated in cultured arterial smooth muscle cells during the first three passages. In vivo, APEG-1 mRNA levels decreased as ASMC changed from a quiescent to a proliferative phenotype in response to vascular injury, suggesting that APEG-1 may have a role in regulating the growth and differentiation of this cell type.

DISCUSSIONUsing differential mRNA display, we have isolated a novel gene, APEG-1, that is preferentially expressed in ASMC. APEG-1 encodes a 12.7-kDa protein (Fig. 3). Its predicted protein sequence reveals an RGD domain and no known nuclear localization signals (33Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 32-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Since an RGD domain is the potential binding site for integrins, this finding would implicate APEG-1 as a membrane protein. However, c-Myc-tagged APEG-1 is localized to the nucleus (Fig. 5). This nuclear localization is not due to the c-Myc tag, because c-Myc-tagged cyclin B protein is expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm (data not shown), as reported previously (34Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 74: 979-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). An as yet unidentified nuclear localization signal may be responsible for its nuclear localization. Alternatively, APEG-1 may dimerize with another protein with a nuclear localization signal and then be transported to the nucleus.trans-Acting factors are nuclear proteins that have important roles in regulating proliferation and differentiation, as well as in determination of cell lineage. For example, members of the MyoD family are expressed only in skeletal muscle cells and define lineage, inhibit proliferation, and promote differentiation of this cell type (35Olson E.N. Klein W.H.

Despite the importance of ASMC in regulating vascular tone and in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases, no ASMC-specific nuclear proteins have been identified (1Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). gax, a recently cloned homeobox gene, also encoding a nuclear protein, is expressed at high levels in both vascular smooth muscle and in striated muscle (19Gorski D.H.

Despite high level expression of APEG-1 in differentiated ASMC in normal aorta, APEG-1 mRNA levels decreased rapidly and disappeared in dedifferentiated ASMC in culture even in early passage (Fig. 6). It has been shown that ASMC grown on Matrigel exhibit a more differentiated phenotype with a low proliferative index and enhanced levels of the smooth muscle isoform of α-actin (38Li X. Tsai P.

Thus, APEG-1 appears to be expressed only in highly differentiated ASMC in normal vessel walls and its down-regulation serves as a sensitive marker for dedifferentiated ASMC in vivo. This is further supported by our in vivo finding that APEG-1 mRNA levels in the carotid artery were markedly down-regulated to ∼18-20% of control after balloon injury when ASMC dedifferentiate (Fig. 7). Taken together, our data indicate that APEG-1 is a novel marker for differentiated ASMC. The immediate down-regulation of this nuclear protein by phenotypic change suggests that it may have a role in regulating growth and differentiation of this cell type. Further work aimed at cloning the APEG-1 gene and its 5′-flanking sequence will allow us to identify ASMC-specific cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that may prove useful for expressing foreign genes in the blood vessel wall.

Various mechanisms could account for synergy, but a central question remains of whether synergism requires transcription factor functions that differ from those that direct independent activation. The rat growth hormone promoter is synergistically activated by the pituitary-specific transcription factor, Pit-1, and the thyroid hormone receptor (TR). Mutations that disrupted the previously described DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains of both Pit-1 and TR reduced Pit-1/TR synergy in parallel with their effects on the much weaker, independent Pit-1 and TR activations of the rat growth hormone promoter. Thus, Pit-1 and TR amplify each other's intrinsic activities. Mutations of Pit-1 that selectively inhibited synergism with the TR without affecting independent Pit-1 activity were also identified. Pit-1/TR synergy is therefore a consequence of a novel synergism-selective activity and synergism-independent Pit-1 and TR functions.

The various factors appear to act in synergy since the collective contributions of these sites to rGH promoter activity exceed the sum of their independent contributions (2Schaufele F. Imura H. The Pituitary Gland. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 91Google Scholar). Changing the relative positions of the binding sites within the rGH promoter also alters promoter strength (4Ye Z.-S.

The rGH promoter is much more active when rat Pit-1 and human β-1 TR are coexpressed in human monocyte U937 cells than when each factor is expressed individually (7Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665Google Scholar). This striking synergism was only observed when the U937 cells were cultured with forskolin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), activators of protein kinases A and C, respectively (8Seamon K.B. Daly J.W. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 7: 201-224Google Scholar, 9Nishizuka Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 13-16Google Scholar). Synergism also displayed thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine)-dependent and -independent components that were differentially dependent on the thyroid hormone response element but required either one of the two more 3′ Pit-1 binding sites in the rGH promoter (7Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665Google Scholar). Thus, Pit-1 and TR bind to separate sites and synergistically activate the rGH promoter. Pit-1 also synergizes with Zn15 (10Lipkin S.M. Naar A.M. Kalla K.A. Sack R.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1674-1687Google Scholar), Ets-1 (11Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20818-20824Google Scholar) to activate the growth hormone, prolactin (PRL), and thyroid-stimulating hormone β subunit promoters, respectively. Both the PRL and thyroid-stimulating hormone β subunit promoters are synergistically activated by Pit-1 and P-Lim expression (15Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse III, R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Google Scholar). Some of the responses of the PRL are synergistic with components of the G/Raf/protein kinase A signal transduction cascade (11Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Google Scholar, 16Tian J. Ma H.W. Bancroft C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 249-256Google Scholar, 17Gaiddon C. Mercken K. Bancroft C. Loeffler J.P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4331-4338Google Scholar) and are inhibited by protein kinase C activation (11Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Google Scholar, 16Tian J. Ma H.W. Bancroft C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 249-256Google Scholar). The undoubted importance of transcriptional synergy to the regulation of the rGH and other, natural promoters ultimately will require a better understanding of the activities required for synergistic activation. To determine if Pit-1/TR synergism requires any of the Pit-1 and TR domains known to be essential for independent Pit-1 or TR activity, mutations in TR and Pit-1 were examined for their effects on the synergistic activation of the rGH promoter in U937 cells. Mutations within the DNA binding, ligand binding, and amino-terminal domains of the TR reduced or eliminated Pit-1/TR synergistic activation. Similarly, synergistic activation was disrupted when the DNA binding domain or the previously described transactivation domain of Pit-1 was deleted. Intriguingly, deleting a proline-rich region of Pit-1 strongly reduced TR-synergistic activation of the rGH promoter without affecting the ability of Pit-1 to independently activate the rGH promoter or a minimal promoter to which Pit-1 binding sites were appended. This synergism-selective effect was also observed for Pit-1/TR synergistic activation of the rGH promoter in mouse pituitary GHFT1-5 cells that are transformed at a developmental stage immediately preceding activation of the rGH promoter (18Lew D. Brady H. Klausing K. Yaginuma K. Theill L.E. Stauber C. Karin M. Mellon P.L. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 683-693Google Scholar). Thus, synergistic activation of the rGH promoter by Pit-1 and TR not only was dependent on Pit-1 and TR functions that are essential for their independent activities but also required an activity that operates only in the synergistic context. cDNA expression vectors, rGH promoter constructs, electroporation, and data analysis were as described previously (7Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665Google Scholar, 19Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Duncan K.G. Lopez G.N. Schaufele F. Uht R.M. Webb P. West B.L. Mol.

Biol. 1987; 7: 1193-1197Google Scholar). 5 µg of the rGHCAT construct was electroporated into U937 or GHFT1-5 cells. 15 µg of Pit-1 expression vector was used to enhance the activation of the rGH promoter by Pit-1 expression alone as shown in Fig. 2, whereas 10 µg of the Pit-1 expression vector was transfected as shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, 4, 5. 15 µg of the TR expression vector was transfected as shown in Fig. 1, whereas 10 µg was used as shown in Figs. 2, 4, and 5. At 15 µg, the control expression vector lacking the TR cDNA weakly activated the rGH promoter in U937 cells to the level of the same expression vector containing TR mutations affecting DNA binding (data not shown). Thus, the C127S, 2-175, and 183-191 TR mutants in Fig. 1 more accurately reflect the absence of any TR activity than the “0 TR” data that, only in Fig. 1, represent points not co-transfected with control TR expression vector. Other empty cDNA expression vectors did not have this weak effect. 1 µg of the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter was co-transfected in all experiments.Fig. 1Both activation domains and the DNA binding domain of TR are required for TR synergy with Pit-1.

CAT and luciferase activities and protein amounts of the extracts of the transfected cells were determined. One or two copies of the distal Pit-1 binding site, dGHF1, of the rGH promoter were cloned into the blunt-ended HindIII site immediately upstream of the −33/+8 rGH promoter to make the 1× dGHF1 and 2× dGHF1 constructions, respectively. The dGHF1 oligonucleotide contained the entire dGHF1 DNase I-protected region from −142 to −106 (21Schaufele F. West B.L. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17189-17196Google Scholar).

Castrillo J.-L. Wu D. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 342: 945-948Google Scholar). The 72-100 and 101-125 mutations (Fig.5) were constructed using the AvaII site between Pit-1 amino acids 100 and 101 and the BglII site that links amino acids 72 and 125 in the 72-125 mutation. The TR mutations (Fig. 1) were obtained from J. L. Jameson and T. Nagaya (Northwestern University). Because Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase activities were activated by Pit-1 or TR expression in U937 cells and because of the relative consistency of transfection by electroporation (data not shown), CAT activity was determined per 100 µg of extract protein (7Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665Google Scholar). The low variability in the averages of independent experiments (see figures) confirms the appropriateness of this method. A single representative experiment is shown in Table I. CAT activities were normalized to a specific reference point (see figure legends) and the mean ± S.D. of multiple experiments determined (see figures).

Open table in a new tab The degree of synergistic activation is expressed as a synergism index in which the promoter activity in the presence of co-expressed TR and Pit-1 is divided by the sum of the activity of the rGH promoter alone and by the increases in this activity caused by independent TR and Pit-1 expression. For example, the synergy between Pit-1 and wild-type TR in Table I is as follows. Activity with both Pit−1 and TRrGH alone+increase by TR alone+increase by Pit-1 alone=Synergism index 62.21.0+(5.1−1.0)+(0.9−1.0)=12.4(Eq. 2) This synergism index is higher than that shown in Fig. 2 in which there was more Pit-1 expression vector transfected, causing higher activity of Pit-1 alone. As previously reported (7Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665Google Scholar), the activity of the rGH promoter was much greater when both wild-type TR and Pit-1 were co-expressed than when TR and Pit-1 were independently expressed. Domains within TR that were required for this synergy and for the much weaker activation of the rGH promoter by TR alone were determined by examining the effects of TR mutations on TR activation of the rGH promoter in U937 cells (Fig. 1). TR mutants with independent or synergistic activities significantly less than wild-type TR are indicated by * (0.01 < p < 0.05) or ** (p < 0.01). Synergistic activation was disrupted when the DNA binding domain of the TR was eliminated (2-175) or disrupted by a point mutation (C127S) in the first zinc finger or by a short deletion of the α-helix at the carboxyl-terminal end of the DNA binding domain (183-191) (Fig. 1). The 183-191 mutation also deleted a nuclear localization signal between amino acids 185 and 191 (24LaCasse E.C. Lochnan H.A. Walker P. Lefebvre Y.A. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1017-1025Google Scholar). The deletion of the TR ligand binding/AF-2 transactivation domain (272-461) or the deletion of a shorter segment of the ligand binding domain (237-245) less severely affected but did reduce synergism with Pit-1. Deletion of the amino-terminal AF-1 transactivation domain of TR also reduced but did not eliminate synergistic activation (2-93). Thus, TR/Pit-1 synergistic activation depends on the TR DNA binding domain and utilizes activities within both the amino-terminal and ligand binding domains. The effects of TR mutations on the much weaker activation of the rGH promoter by TR alone paralleled the effects of the same mutations on Pit-1/TR synergistic activation (Fig. 1). Mutations in Pit-1 were tested for their effect on independent and TR-synergistic activation of the rGH promoter carried in two vector backgrounds that differ in the extent to which the rGH promoter is activated by Pit-1 expression alone (7Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665Google Scholar). Pit-1 alone strongly activated the rGH promoter carried in the wild-type pUC vector (9.4 ± 2.7-fold; Fig. 2B) but had a relatively minor effect (2.9 ± 1.9-fold; Fig. 2A) on the rGH promoter inserted into a pUC vector with sequences known to activate a number of linked promoters deleted (19Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Duncan K.G. Lopez G.N. Schaufele F. Uht R.M. Webb P. West B.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 405-407Google Scholar). All experiments other than those in Fig. 2B were conducted with the modified pUC vector to minimize the contributions of non-rGH promoter sequences. The degree of synergistic activation was expressed as a synergism index (see “Experimental Procedures”) in which a value of 1.0 is indicative of the simple summation of the independent TR and Pit-1 activations. Pit-1/TR synergy was observed in both vector backgrounds although the extent of synergy was somewhat blunted in the wild-type pUC background due to the high level of activity of Pit-1 alone (7Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665Google Scholar). The effects of the mutations on independent or synergistic Pit-1 activation are similar in both vector backgrounds, suggesting that the pUC element did not alter the Pit-1 activities required for independent or TR-synergistic functions. Eliminating the Pit-1 DNA binding (124-201, 209-252, and 255-291) or transactivation (2-45 and 48-73) domains (22Theill L.E. Castrillo J.-L. Wu D. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 342: 945-948Google Scholar) abolished both independent and TR-synergistic activation of the rGH promoter by Pit-1 (Fig. 2). Therefore, as with the TR (Fig. 1), Pit-1/TR synergism depended on the integrity of both the DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains of Pit-1 required for independent activation (Fig. 2). The dependence of synergy on the Pit-1 and TR DNA binding domains is consistent with our previously reported dependence of synergy on the Pit-1 and TR binding sites within the rGH promoter (7Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pit-1/TR synergy also required a previously undetected, synergism-selective function. Deletion of amino acids 72 and 125 within Pit-1, shown previously to not affect Pit-1 activity (22Theill L.E. Castrillo J.-L. Wu D. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 342: 945-948Google Scholar), significantly reduced or eliminated synergism with the TR but had no effect on the activation by Pit-1 alone (Fig. 2, A and B, boxed). The equivalence of the wild-type (wt) and 72-125 mutant was also demonstrated on a minimal promoter to which a single Pit-1 binding site was attached (Fig. 3). Expression of neither the wild-type nor the 72-125 mutant Pit-1 activated a truncated rGH promoter containing little more than the TATA box (−33 to +8). In contrast, the wild-type and mutant Pit-1 equally activated the −33/+8 promoter to which a single copy (1×) of the distal Pit-1 binding site, dGHF1, and overlapping Sp1 site (21Schaufele F. West B.L. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17189-17196Google Scholar) of the rGH promoter was appended. Thus, a deletion of amino acids 72 and 125 defines an activity within Pit-1 that is selectively required for TR-synergistic activation of the rGH promoter in U937 cells. To test for the effects of the synergism-selective mutations in cells more closely related to those in which GH is normally expressed, we developed a Pit-1/TR synergism assay in a mouse pituitary cell line (Fig. 4). GHFT1-5 cells are immortalized at a stage during pituitary development when the Pit-1 promoter is active but before the growth hormone gene is expressed (18Lew D. Brady H. Klausing K. Yaginuma K. Theill L.E. Stauber C. Karin M. Mellon P.L. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 683-693Google Scholar). In our hands, the transfected −237/+8 rGH promoter was somewhat active in GHFT1-5 cells (Fig. 4, 0, Pit-1; 0, TR; 0, PMA/forskolin (PF)) possibly because these cells contain a moderate amount of Pit-1 (18Lew D. Brady H. Klausing K. Yaginuma K. Theill L.E. Stauber C. Karin M. Mellon P.L. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 683-693Google Scholar). There was no further activation of the promoter if the cells were transfected with vectors that express either Pit-1 or the TR. Co-transfection of both the Pit-1 and TR expression vectors also did not increase the activity of the rGH promoter unless the GHFT1-5 cells were cultured with 10−8M PMA and 10−5M forskolin (Fig. 4, +, PF), in which case the rGH promoter activity was 2.5 ± 0.9 times the sum of the increases by independent Pit-1 and TR expression. Thus, as in U937 cells, Pit-1/TR synergy in GHFT1-5 was sensitive to the cellular environment. Synergy was less dramatic than in U937 cells (Fig. 1, Fig. 2A) possibly because of the presence of endogenous Pit-1 and/or the absence of other factors necessary for synergy. As in U937 cells (Fig. 2), the 72-125 mutant of Pit-1 did not synergize with TR to activate the rGH promoter in GHFT1-5 cells (Fig. 5A). Further deletion mapping showed that the synergism-selective activity required Pit-1 amino acids 72-100 but that amino acids 101-125 were dispensable for Pit-1/TR synergism on the rGH promoter. The wild-type and 72-125, 72-100, or 101-125 mutant Pit-1 proteins were equally capable of activating the minimal −33/+8 promoter under the control of the distal Pit-1 binding site, dGHF1, in GHFT1-5 cells (Fig. 5B). The poor activation of the 1× dGHF1 promoter by Pit-1 co-expression was possibly related to the presence of saturating, endogenous Pit-1. Activation by the exogenously expressed wild-type and mutant Pit-1 proteins became more obvious when an additional copy of the Pit-1 binding site was supplied (Fig. 5B, 2× dGHF1). Therefore, the 72-100 and 72-125 mutants were adequately expressed and were functionally competent in GHFT1-5 cells but were unable to synergize with the TR. Despite a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the activities of individual transcription factors, relatively little is known about the synergistic actions of transcription factors binding separately to distinct promoter sites (25Herbomel P. New Biol. 1990; 2: 1063-1070Google Scholar, 26Lin Y.-S. Carey M. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 345: 359-361Google Scholar, 27Carey M. Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Google Scholar). Changes in chromatin or DNA structure accompanying the binding of one factor could facilitate the binding or activity of the other factor (28Cowell I.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 38-42Google Scholar, 29Getzenberg R.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 22-31Google Scholar, 30Chang C. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell.

Alternatively, the factors could be synergistic through their concerted activities such as the recruitment to the promoter of the same, or complementary, rate-limiting components of the basal transcription apparatus (32Szymanski P. Levine M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2229-2238Google Scholar, 33Ptashne M. Gann A.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 329-331Google Scholar, 34Chi T. Lieberman P. Ellwood K. Carey M. Nature. 1995; 377: 254-257Google Scholar, 35Ohashi Y. Brickman J.M. Furman E. Middleton B. Carey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2731-2739Google Scholar). In the few examples studied, synergistic activation domains could not confer synergy when transferred to a single DNA binding domain (36Oliviero S. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 224-228Google Scholar, 37Emami K.H. Carey M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5005-5012Google Scholar), suggesting that passive, simultaneous localization of multiple activation domains at the promoter is insufficient for synergy. A central issue becomes whether synergistic activation can be completely understood by the independent biochemical activities of the individual factors or whether the synergistic partners utilize distinct activities in the synergistic context. To address whether the synergistic activation of the rGH promoter was due to mutual or complementary intrinsic activities of Pit-1 and TR, or whether Pit-1 and TR acquire or utilize new properties that they do not possess when operating in isolation, we analyzed whether domains previously identified for independent Pit-1 and TR transcriptional activity were also required for Pit-1/TR synergy. The previously described DNA binding and transactivation functions of both Pit-1 and the TR were required for the synergistic activation of the rGH promoter (Fig. 1, Fig. 2), suggesting that the molecular mechanisms underlying synergistic and independent activation may at least partially overlap. Thus, synergy may require the amplification of independent Pit-1 and TR functions. The dependence of synergy on the intrinsic activation functions of both synergistic partners has also been observed in the few other examples in which required activities in both factors have been investigated (15Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse III, R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Google Scholar, 38Holloway J.M. Szeto D.P. Scully K.M.

Other studies have also demonstrated that at least one of the synergizing partners required their intrinsic activation functions (11Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Google Scholar, 40Muller M. Baniahmad C. Kaltschmidt C. Renkawitz R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1498-1503Google Scholar, 41Kunsch C. Lang R.K.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Google Scholar). A novel activity defined by the Pit-1 72-100 and 72-125 mutations operated only in the TR-synergistic context in two different cell types (Figs. 2, 3, and 5). These Pit-1 amino acids were not required for independent Pit-1 activation of the rGH promoter (Fig. 2), suggesting that this synergism-selective activity depended on the specific combination of factors available to bind the rGH promoter. Amino acids 72 and 125 were also not required for activating a minimal promoter to which Pit-1 binding sites were appended (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5B) or for cooperating with an ill defined site within the pUC vector (compare independent Pit-1 activations in Figs. 2, A and B). Synergistic activation of the PRL promoter by Pit-1 and estrogen receptor in CV-1 cells was also not affected by deleting Pit-1 amino acids 72 and 128 (38Holloway J.M. Szeto D.P. Scully K.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1992-2006Google Scholar), confirming that the Pit-1/TR synergism-selective activity identified by deleting Pit-1 amino acids 72-125 and 72-100 (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5) is rGH promoter-specific. Very few other examples of synergism-selective activities have been previously reported (15Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse III, R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Google Scholar, 38Holloway J.M. Szeto D.P. Scully K.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1992-2006Google Scholar, 40Muller M. Baniahmad C. Kaltschmidt C. Renkawitz R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1498-1503Google Scholar) but do include a deletion of Pit-1 amino acids 45-72 that selectively inhibited Pit-1/estrogen receptor synergy (38Holloway J.M. Szeto D.P. Scully K.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1992-2006Google Scholar) without affecting independent Pit-1 activation of the PRL promoter. In our system, the very similar 48-73 deletion disrupted both Pit-1 independent activation as well as Pit-1/TR synergy of the rGH promoter (Fig. 2). Thus, the mechanism of synergistic activation of even the related (1Theill L.E. Karin M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 670-689Google Scholar, 2Schaufele F. Imura H. The Pituitary Gland. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 91Google Scholar, 3Rhodes S.J. DiMattia G.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 709-717Google Scholar), pituitary-specific GH and PRL promoters differs. Some promoter-specific differences in Pit-1 synergy may be at least partially mediated by dimeric status of Pit-1 dictated by the sequence of the Pit-1 binding sites (38Holloway J.M. Szeto D.P. Scully K.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1992-2006Google Scholar). Given the dependence of Pit-1/TR synergy on forskolin and PMA induction (7Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665Google Scholar) (Fig. 4), the synergism-selective mutations may define a protein kinase A or C phosphorylation site that is critical to synergy. However, the protein kinase A and C sites within Pit-1 have been well characterized both in vivo and in vitro (46Kapiloff M.S. Farkash Y. Wegner M. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 786-789Google Scholar), and no sites are located within amino acids 72-100. Unless altered folding of the 72-100 deletion mutant sterically blocks one of the protein kinase A or C sites in Pit-1, the Pit-1/TR synergism-selective mutant is unlikely to define a phosphorylation site selectively required for Pit-1/TR synergy. One model of synergistic activation proposes that a novel complex formed between two synergistically active factors (15Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse III, R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Google Scholar, 44Nagulapalli S. Pongubala J.M. Atchison M.L. J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1169-1178Google Scholar) may possess properties not, or weakly, present in each of the individual factors. In such a model, synergism-selective activities could include amino acids required for complex formation. Indeed, a synergism-selective mutation recently reported within the pituitary-specific transcription factor P-Lim was observed to inhibit both Pit-1/P-Lim interaction in vitro and Pit-1/P-Lim synergistic activation of the prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone β subunit promoters (15Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse III, R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Google Scholar). In contrast, we have observed that Pit-1 and TR form a complex in vitro but that the Pit-1/TR complex forms as efficiently with the 72-125 mutant Pit-1 as it does with the wild-type Pit-1. 2F. Schaufele, T. Nagaya, J. L., Jameson, and J. D. Baxter, unpublished data. Instead, two autonomous TR binding sites map to the highly conserved POU domain of Pit-1.2 Thus, although the formation of a Pit-1/TR complex may contribute to synergistic activation, Pit-1 amino acids 72-100 contribute to synergy by a mechanism different than passive TR binding. Five prolines are found within a 26-amino acid stretch that is deleted in the 72-100 mutation (Fig. 5C, p). Eight of the nine other prolines present in the remaining 265 amino acids lie between amino acids 5 and 127. Proline-rich activation domains have been reported in a number of other transcription factors (48Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2212-2224Google Scholar). It is possible that the 72-100 deletion identifies a proline-rich activator operating selectively in the synergistic context. Such structural correlations are, however, not very conclusive as demonstrated by the wild-type transcriptional properties of the 101-125 mutant Pit-1 protein (Fig. 5) that has a putative “acid blob” (49Sigler P.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 210-212Google Scholar, 50Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Google Scholar) transcriptional activator deleted (Fig. 5C, −). Regardless of the biochemical nature of the synergism-selective activity affected by deleting amino acids 72-100, it is obvious that elements of the classically defined, intrinsic transcriptional activation domain of Pit-1 (amino acids 1-72) are still required for TR-synergistic activation of the rGH promoter (Fig. 2). Whether the synergism-selective function is merely an extension of the classical transactivation domain or whether it defines a separable but co-dependent function remains unknown. The synergism-selective activity could complement a cryptic activity present in TR and therefore be observed only when TR is present, or the synergism-selective function may be independently active but not available or active until TR binds to DNA, chromatin, or to Pit-1. Numerous other mechanisms are possible, but it is evident from the current data and from synergism-selective mutations affecting Pit-1/P-Lim (15Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse III, R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Google Scholar) and Pit-1/estrogen receptor (38Holloway J.M. Szeto D.P. Scully K.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1992-2006Google Scholar) activation of the PRL promoter that the molecular mechanisms controlling the transcription of at least the rGH and rPRL promoters cannot be fully understood solely by studying the molecular functions of each factor in isolation.

In cell-attached recordings from intact cells, removal of metabolic substrates (25/28 cells) or exposure to metabolic inhibitors (32/40 cells) opened K<sup>+</sup>-selective channels with a conductance of 6.5 ± 0.2 pS. Channels had an open probability of 0.31 ± 0.08 and opened in bursts averaging 3.55 ± 0.27 ms in duration (<i>n</i> = 6). Metabolic stress was associated with rapid translocation of the α isoform of protein kinase C (PKCα) from cytosol to membrane; and down-regulation of PKCα by phorbol esters or exposure to the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (10 µM) each inhibited currents. Moreover, intracellular perfusion with purified PKCα activated currents in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and concentration-dependent manner. These findings indicate that metabolic stress leads to opening of apamin-sensitive SK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in hepatoma cells through a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and PKC-dependent mechanism and suggest that PKCα may be selectively involved in the response. This mechanism functionally couples the metabolic state of cells to membrane K<sup>+</sup> permeability and represents a potential target for modification of liver injury associated with ischemia and preservation."

In proteins attached to the membrane via a GPI-anchor the glycolipid tail has been shown to function as an apical sorting signal in the kidney-derived MDCK cells (4Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W.

These rafts can be isolated from MDCK cells by virtue of their low density and their insolubility in Triton or Chaps extracts in the cold (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

In contrast to the targeting of GPI-anchored proteins, we have very limited information on the molecular mechanisms of apical secretory protein sorting in epithelial cells. It has been shown recently that the carbohydrate moieties of secretory glycoproteins are crucial determinants for their transport to the apical surface in MDCK cells and that the mannose-rich core carbohydrate structure is sufficient for apical delivery (11Urban J.

On the basis of these results it has been proposed that the interaction with a lectin-like protein represents a key feature in the apical targeting of secretory proteins (12Scheiffele P. Peränen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 15Wagner M. Morgans C. Koch-Brandt C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 84-88PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Given the pivotal role of glycosphingolipids in the correct routing of GPI-anchored proteins to the apical plasma membrane, it has further been suggested that secretory proteins are sorted by a receptor that interacts with glycosphingolipids (1Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Alternatively, apical secretory proteins could directly interact with GPI-anchored proteins on their way to the cell surface. In both cases, GPI-anchored proteins and secretory proteins would exploit similar molecular mechanisms to reach the apical cell surface. There are two independent approaches to test this hypothesis. First, it can be analyzed if a secretory glycoprotein that has been shown to be sorted into the apical exocytic pathway in MDCK cells is included into glycolipid enriched rafts on its way to the cell surface. Second, it can be studied whether in cells in which the sorting of GPI-anchored proteins to the apical surface is perturbated, the targeting of an apical secretory protein is concomitantly affected. Here we report a study using both approaches to characterize the sorting of gp80 (clusterin, apolipoprotein J) to the apical cell surface in polarized epithelial cells. The biogenesis and apical secretion of this glycoprotein has been well characterized in the kidney-derived MDCK cells as well as in other cell lines (11Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Pilarsky C. Haase W. Koch-Brandt C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18Appel D. Koch-Brandt C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 553-555PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 17: 154-159Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The protein is synthesized as a single chain precursor protein of 68 kDa in its high mannose form and of 80 kDa in its terminally glycosylated form. The protein is cleaved intracellularly into subunits of 35 and 45 kDa that are secreted as a disulfide-linked heterodimeric complex. We show that in contrast to GPI-anchored proteins, newly synthesized gp80 is not associated with detergent-insoluble complexes in MDCK cells. Furthermore in FRT cells that sort GPI-anchored proteins preferentially to the basolateral surface (10Zurzolo C. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Zurzolo C. Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the gp80 glycoprotein is secreted at the apical plasma membrane domain. Together these results suggest that this glycoprotein is routed to the apical cell surface independently of GPI-anchored proteins and glycosphingolipids. FRT (kindly provided by Dr. L. Nitsch, University of Naples, Italy) and MDCK (ATCC CCL 34) cells were grown on plastic dishes or polycarbonate filters as described previously (10Zurzolo C. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on filters at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/filter and used for experiments after 3 (MDCK) or 4 (FRT) days at a density of 3.3 ± 0.3 × 106 cells/filter. The transepithelial electrical resistance of filter-grown monolayers was measured in situ, using the Millicell®-ERS voltohmmeter (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). For the analysis of the partitioning in phase-separated Triton X-114 solutions of newly synthesized gp80 and GPI-anchored proteins in MDCK cells, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min (11Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and then incubated for 1 h at 19.5°C (21Matlin K.S. Simons K. Cell. 1983; 34: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-114 (22Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All media were supplemented with protease inhibitors (antipain, 1 µg/ml; trypsin inhibitor, 10 µg/ml; and benzamidin, 1.75 µg/ml). Proteins in the clarified cell lysates were subjected to temperature-induced phase separation as described by Lisanti et al. (23Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Both phases were analyzed for the presence of gp80 by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-canine gp80 antibody (11Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The re-extracted detergent phase was diluted with 100 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA to a final volume of 500 µl and incubated in the presence or absence of phosphatidylinositol-dependent phospholipase C (PI-PLC, 6 units/ml; obtained from Dr. Martin G. Low, Columbia University, New York) for 1 h at 37°C under continuous mixing. After PI-PLC treatment, 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 2% Triton X-114 was added, and the samples were partitioned into aqueous and detergent phases. Both phases were re-extracted three times and then processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under nonreducing conditions (24Piccioni R. Bellemare G. Chua N.H. Edelman M. Hallich R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical, Amsterdam1982: 985Google Scholar, 25Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar). To analyze the association of gp80 with detergent-insoluble complexes, the method by Brown and Rose was used (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDCK cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min with [35S]methionine and chased for various times before they were lysed for 20 min on ice in an extraction buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Lysates and insoluble material were collected and centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatants were harvested and the pellets solubilized in 100 µl of buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 8.8, 5 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS. The supernatants and the solubilized pellets were adjusted to 0.1% SDS and used for immunoprecipitation. To analyze the polarity of gp80 secretion from FRT cells, the cells were grown on polycarbonate filters, pulse-labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine and chased in nonradioactive medium for either 5 or 180 min. Proteins in the lysates of the cells chased for 5 min and in the media of cells chased for 180 min were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-rat gp80 antibody, kindly provided by Dr. S. Sylvester (Washington State University, Pullman, WA), separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and detected by fluorography (24Piccioni R. Bellemare G. Chua N.H. Edelman M. Hallich R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical, Amsterdam1982: 985Google Scholar, 25Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar). Specific bands on appropriate exposures were quantitated by densitometric scanning with CS-1 Image Documentation System and analyzed with WINCAM software from CYBERTECH (Berlin/Germany). Quantification is based on the data of at least three independent experiments. To investigate whether gp80 is associated with GPI-anchored proteins at the site of sorting in the TGN, the partitioning of the proteins in phase-separated Triton X-114 solutions was characterized. MDCK-cells were incubated for 1 h at 19.5°C to accumulate newly synthesized plasma membrane and secretory proteins in the late Golgi and TGN, lysed, and subjected to Triton X-114 extraction according to the scheme shown in Fig. 1A. In this analysis GPI-anchored proteins were recovered from the detergent pellet. They were identified by the PI-PLC-induced transition into a soluble form that is recovered from the aqueous supernatant (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the GPI-anchored proteins, the gp80 glycoprotein was exclusively detected in the aqueous phase in both the high mannose 68-kDa form as well as in the terminally glycosylated 80-kDa form, indicating that gp80 is not associated with GPI-anchored proteins on its way to the apical plasma membrane. To investigate whether gp80 is associated with GSL-enriched membrane microdomains by a mechanism other than a direct interaction with GPI-anchored proteins, we analyzed if the protein was present in detergent-insoluble complexes at any stage of its biogenesis. Newly synthesized proteins were metabolically labeled and chased at 37°C for various times up to 1 h. At this time most of the newly synthesized gp80 has been exported from the cell. At each time the cells were lysed and the proteins subjected to a Triton X-100 extraction in the cold, as described by Brown and Rose (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). Proteins were immunoprecipitated from the soluble fraction and the solubilized pellet and processed for SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). In this analysis gp80 was detected in the high mannose 68-kDa form up to 10 min of chase (lanes 1–4) and then matured into the 80-kDa terminally glycosylated protein (lanes 5–10). The protein was recovered exclusively from the soluble fraction at all times of chase. These results indicate that in contrast to GPI-anchored proteins the gp80 glycoprotein is not included in detergent-insoluble complexes on its way to the apical surface of MDCK cells. One caveat of this approach is that an association of gp80 with GPI-anchored proteins to weak to be demonstrated by noncovalent co-association would have escaped our attention. To exclude this possibility we also studied the intracellular transport of newly synthesized gp80 in FRT cells. These cells cluster glycosphingolipids into Triton-insoluble complexes, but fail to include GPI-anchored proteins (10Zurzolo C. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Zurzolo C. Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This defect, which correlates with the lack of VIP21/caveolin, requires that these cells use a fundamentally different mechanism to transport GPI-anchored proteins to the cell surface, which results in the preferential targeting to the basolateral plasma membrane domain. No apically secreted proteins have yet been characterized in FRT cells. If there was any association of gp80 with GPI-ancored proteins that was crucial for its targeting, gp80 should in these cells be secreted predominantly at the basolateral cell surface. As revealed by our analysis, FRT cells endogenously express the rat homologue of the gp80 glycoprotein and process it in a way similar to what has been observed in MDCK and other cells (11Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Collard M.W. Griswold M.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3297-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The protein is synthesized as a single chain precursor of approximate 65 kDa in its high mannose form. Upon terminal glycosylation, the precursor is cleaved intracellularly into two subunits with an apparent Mr of approximately 45,000 and 35,000. The two subunits are secreted from FRT cells as a disulfide-linked complex. The analysis of the polarity of gp80 secretion in filter-grown FRT cells revealed that 85% of the newly synthesized gp80 is secreted apically, and only a minor component (15%) is released at the basolateral cell surface (Fig. 3). These results suggest that in FRT cells the gp80 glycoprotein is routed by a mechanism distinct from that used to transport independent GPI-anchored proteins. In MDCK and other epithelial cell lines, GPI-anchored proteins are located predominantly in the apical plasma membrane domain (5Lisanti M.P. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To date only two exceptions are known: FRT cells, which preferentially segregate GPI-anchored proteins into the basolateral plasma membrane domain, and MDCK-ConA cells, which miss-sort those proteins to both cell surface domains (10Zurzolo C. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Zurzolo C. Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In MDCK cells, GPI-anchored proteins become insoluble in nonionic detergent as they pass through the Golgi complex (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this insolubility reflects the clustering of these proteins together with apically destined glycosphingolipids in specialized, caveolin-containing membrane microdomains in the TGN (9Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 28Hannan L.A. Lisanti M.P. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It was further proposed that this process constitutes a key event in the sorting of apical proteins (6van Meer G. Simons K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 36: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 29Brown D.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 338-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis it was observed that in FRT cells, which do not express caveolin, GPI-anchored proteins fail to assemble into clusters with glycosphingolipids, but remain detergent-soluble during their entire biogenesis and are preferentially segregated into the basolateral plasma membrane domain (10Zurzolo C. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Zurzolo C. Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In mutant MDCK cells resistant to the lectin concanavalin A, GPI-anchored proteins are miss-sorted to both surfaces, although a fusion GPI-anchored protein, gD1-DAF, was found together with glycosphingolipids in Triton-insoluble complexes during transport to the cell surface (10Zurzolo C. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that apart from clustering into glycolipid-enriched membrane microdomains additional factors are required for the sorting of GPI-anchored proteins to the apical plasma membrane domain (10Zurzolo C. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In order to gain insight into the process of secretory protein sorting, we analyzed if apically secreted proteins are sorted by mechanisms linked to the targeting of GPI-anchored proteins. To this end we characterized the transport of the apical secretory glycoprotein gp80 in MDCK cells and in cells that fail to sort GPI proteins to the apical cell surface. We show that, in contrast to GPI-anchored proteins, gp80 is not associated with detergent-insoluble complexes in MDCK cells. Furthermore, the sorting of gp80 to the apical cell surface is not impaired in FRT cells. In a previous study investigating the role of the carbohydrate moieties in apical sorting, we have shown that gp80 is faithfully targeted to the apical cell surface in MDCK-ConA cells (15Wagner M. Morgans C. Koch-Brandt C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 84-88PubMed Google Scholar). Our results therefore imply that in these three cell lines the sorting of the gp80 glycoprotein to the apical cell surface occurs independently of the sorting of GPI-anchored proteins and does not involve an association with GSL-enriched membrane microdomains. This has also been suggested by a study of Mays et al. (30Mays R.W. Siemers K.A. Fritz B.A. Lowe A.W. van Meer G. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) who characterized the mechanisms of generating Na/K-ATPase polarity in transfected MDCK cells. They noted that the correct sorting of an 84-kDa apical secretory protein, presumably gp80, was maintained in the presence of fumonisin B1, a fungal metabolite that inhibits sphingolipid biosynthesis. In order to generalize our findings other well characterized apically secreted proteins need to be analyzed. There are three candidate proteins: a 20-kDa osteopontin-derived protein, erythropoietin, and human corticosteroid binding globulin, all of which have been shown to be released apically in MDCK cells (31Ullrich O. Mann K. Haase W. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3518-3525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kitagawa Y. Sano Y. Higashio K. Narita H. Okano M. Masumoto S. Sasaki R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 33Musto N.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Irrespective of these investigations, however, the present study demonstrating that at least one apically secreted protein is targeted independently of GPI-anchored proteins, and GSL suggests that there is more than one mechanism for the sorting of apical proteins. It is interesting to note that also apical transmembrane proteins need not necessarily be associated with detergent-insoluble complexes on their way to the cell surface. While influenza virus hemagglutinin, sucrase-isomaltase, aminopeptidase N and A, and dipepdidyl peptidase IV were shown to be partially insoluble in Triton X-100 at low temperature, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase and a number of other brush border transmembrane proteins were found to be fully soluble in detergent (34Skibbens J.E. Roth M.G. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 35Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 36Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Whether this reflects differences in the routing of transmembrane proteins that are specific for the cell type or for the protein remains to be elucidated by further investigations. These results suggest, however, that in epithelial cells distinct mechanisms exist to sort GPI-anchored proteins and transmembrane proteins to the apical surface. It now needs to be investigated whether those apical membrane proteins that are sorted intracellularly and secretory proteins use both the same mechanisms and the same type of transport vesicles to reach the cell surface. Studying the transport of membrane and secretory proteins in MDCK cells, Boll et al. (37Boll W. Partin J.S. Katz A.I. Caplan M.J. Jamieson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8592-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) proposed, on the basis of a differential sensitivity toward microtubule disrupting drugs, that distinct pathways exist for the transport of membrane and secretory proteins to the basolateral cell surface. By analogy it could well be that also in the apical exocytic pathway transmembrane and secretory proteins are routed by distinct carrier vesicles and that GPI-anchored proteins use a third class of vesicles to reach the apical plasma membrane domain. Therefore the picture that emerges from all these studies is that in polarized epithelial cells there is not a basolateral and an apical pathway, but that multiple sorting mechanisms and routes are used for different classes of proteins within a single cell type. We are indebted to Drs. S. Sylvester, L. Nitsch, and M. G. Low for their generous gifts of a polyclonal anti-rat gp80 antibody, FRT cells, and for bacterial PI-PLC, respectively. We thank Ch. Weindel for help with the preparation of the manuscript, Drs. G. Klock and O. Ullrich for critically reading it, and all our colleagues for their interest and stimulating discussions."

Cys-87 was unreactive to maleimides under all conditions in wild-type ECF1 and ECF1F0 but became reactive when Glu-381 of β was replaced by a cysteine or alanine. The reactivity of Cys-87 with maleimides was nucleotide-dependent, occurring with ATP or ADP + EDTA in catalytic sites, in the presence of AMP·PNP + Mg2+ but not with ADP + Mg2+ bound, whether Pi was present or not, and not when nucleotide binding sites were empty. Binding of N-ethylmaleimide had no effect, whereas 7-diethyl-amino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin increased the ATPase activity of ECF1 more than 2-fold by reaction with Cys-87. In ECF1F0, these reagents inhibited activity. The nucleotide dependence of the reaction of Cys-87 of the γ subunit depended on the presence of the ε subunit. In ε subunit-free ECF1, maleimides reacted with Cys-87 under all nucleotide conditions, including when catalytic sites were empty.

These results are discussed in terms of nucleotide-dependent movements of the γ subunit during functioning of the F1F0-type ATPase. F1F0-type ATPases catalyze oxidative or photo-phosphorylation by using a transmembrane proton motive force to drive ATP synthesis (reviewed in Senior, 30Senior A.E. Physiol.

As first demonstrated by electron microscopy studies (Tiedge et al., 32Tiedge H. Lunsdorf H. Schafer G. Schairer H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7874-7878Google Scholar; Gogol et al., 16Gogol E.P. Aggeler R. Sagermann M. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28 (a): 4717-4724Google Scholar, 17Gogol E.P. Lücken U. Bork T. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28 (b): 4709-4716Google Scholar), the three α and three β subunits alternate in a hexagonal arrangement surrounding a central cavity containing the γ subunit. The recent high resolution structure of the beef heart F1 (MF1) confirms this arrangement and shows that the part of the γ subunit within the α3β3 domain is in the form of two large α helices, one provided by residues 1-45 (ECF1 numbering system) and the other by residues 223-286 (Abrahams et al. 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar). A third short α helix of the γ subunit has been resolved in the x-ray analysis (Abrahams et al. 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar). This short segment of residues 82-99, including an intrinsic Cys residue (Cys-87), binds to the so-called DELSEED region (residues 380-386) of one of the β subunits. Recent evidence indicates that the γ subunit runs from within the α3β3 domain of the F1 through the stalk region that connects the F1 to F0 (Gogol et al., 15Gogol E.P. Lücken U. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 274-278Google Scholar; Lücken et al., 25Lücken U. Gogol E.P. Capaldi R.A.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 235-238Google Scholar). It is now generally agreed that energy coupling within the F1F0 complex is by conformational changes involving the stalk-forming subunits, including the γ subunit (reviewed in Boyer, 7Boyer P.D.

Previously, we have provided evidence of nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in the γ subunit around Cys residues site-directed into positions 8 and 106 of this subunit (Aggeler and Capaldi, 2Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21355-21359Google Scholar, 3Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14576-14578Google Scholar; Turina and Capaldi, 33Turina P. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Here, we describe studies in which one of the two intrinsic Cys residues of the γ subunit is reacted with various maleimides in both ECF1 and ECF1F0. This residue, shown to be Cys-87, is shielded in wild-type enzyme but becomes available for reaction in ECF1 (and ECF1F0) when Glu-381 of the β subunit is replaced by a smaller side chain, e.g. by a Cys or an Ala. The interaction of the short α helix of γ with the DELSEED region is shown to be nucleotide-dependent and, as with ATP hydrolysis-driven structural changes already observed at residues 8 or 106, requires binding of the ε subunit. CM and BM were obtained from Molecular Probes; Sephadex G-50 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; all other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma. Routine cloning was carried out in XL1-Blue and site-directed mutagenesis in CJ236 according to Kunkel et al. (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar). Mutant ATPase and ATP synthase was isolated from AN888 (unc−), transformed with unc operon containing plasmids. The Cys residue at position 87 of the γ subunit was replaced with Ser by using M13mp18 that contained the 1.4-kb EcoRI/SmaI fragment (Aggeler and Capaldi, 2Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21355-21359Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotide GACCGTGGTTTGGCGGTGGTTTG. Successful mutagenesis was shown by testing for the newly created BsrBI restriction site. The mutation was incorporated in an unc operon-containing plasmid in two steps. (i) The 1.1-kb SfuI/EcoRI fragment from M13mp18 was inserted in the pBluescript derivative pRA13 (Aggeler et al., 6Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Google Scholar). (ii) The 2.8-kb SstI/XhoI fragment of this plasmid was then introduced in pRA134 (Aggeler et al., 6Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Google Scholar), creating pRA149 with the mutation βE381C/γC87S/εS108C. The Glu in position 381 of the β subunit was replaced with an Ala by using M13mp18 that contained the 1.01-kb NcoI insert, described in Aggeler et al. (5Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Google Scholar), and the oligonucleotide TTCTTCAGACAAT-CATCCATACC (nucleotide A was introduced to obtain a new NsiI restriction site for analysis). The NcoI fragment was introduced in pRA13 and then the 5.8-kb XhoI/NsiI fragment in pRA100 (Aggeler et al., 5Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Google Scholar), creating pRA155 with the mutation βE381A. The mutants βE381C and βE381C/εS108C have been described already (Aggeler et al., 6Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Google Scholar). ECF1 was isolated by a modification of the method of Wise et al. (37Wise J.G. Latchney R.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10383-10389Google Scholar) described in Gogol et al. (17Gogol E.P. Lücken U. Bork T. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28 (b): 4709-4716Google Scholar). The enzyme was precipitated for 1 h at 4°C in 70% (NH4)2SO4, pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the protein then dissolved in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol (v/v). Loosely bound nucleotides were removed by passing samples of enzyme through two consecutive centrifuge columns (Sephadex G-50, fine, 0.5 × 5.5 cm) (Penefsky, 29Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Google Scholar) equilibrated in the same buffer. The resulting ECF1 preparations retain 1.6-1.8 mol of ADP + ATP bound in noncatalytic sites (see also Haughton and Capaldi, 21Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20568-20574Google Scholar). ECF1F0 was prepared according to Foster and Fillingame (13Foster D.L. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8230-8236Google Scholar) with modifications described in Aggeler et al. (4Aggeler R. Zhang Y.-Z. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7107-7113Google Scholar). This ATP synthase was reconstituted into egg-lecithin vesicles by the method described in Aggeler et al. (6Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Google Scholar). For modification by maleimides, nucleotide-depleted ECF1 (2-3 µM) was equilibrated at room temperature in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol (v/v) buffer for 0.5-1 h. After addition of nucleotide, as stated, the enzyme was incubated for 5 min before the various maleimides were added. Samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature and at specific time intervals, aliquots withdrawn, and the reaction quenched by the addition of 20 mM DTT. The reaction of ECF1F0 with maleimides was done similarly, except in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. Labeling of ECF1 from the mutant βE381C with [14C]NEM (DuPont NEN) was conducted in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, in the presence of different nucleotides as indicated, using 20 µM of the maleimide. Data were analyzed as described in Haughton and Capaldi (21Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20568-20574Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured with a regenerating system described by Lötscher et al. (24Lötscher H.-R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Google Scholar). ε-Depleted ECF1 was prepared according to Dunn (12Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 35-42Google Scholar) but using Sephacryl S300 (Pharmacia) followed by two passages through an ε-4 monoclonal antibody affinity column. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay (Pierce Chemical Co.). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with a 10-18% SDS-containing gradient gel (Laemmli, 23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Protein bands on gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (Downer et al., 9Downer N.W. Robinson N.C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2930-2936Google Scholar). In earlier studies, using the mutant βE381C, we had noted that an intrinsic Cys of the γ subunit was reactive to various maleimides. This preliminary observation was followed up as an approach to examining the conformation of the γ subunit under different nucleotide conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, there was incorporation of [14C]NEM into the γ subunit of ECF1 isolated from the mutant βE381C when the reaction was carried out in ATP + EDTA, but no significant labeling if the reaction was carried out in EDTA alone (no nucleotide in catalytic sites) or in ADP + Mg2++ Pi. In these experiments, NEM was incorporated rapidly into the Cys at position 381 of β, as well as into the δ subunit (not shown). The δ subunit is reactive to maleimides in wild-type ECF1, but its modification (at Cys-140) has no effect on activity (Mendel-Hartvig and Capaldi, 27Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 115-124Google Scholar; Ziegler et al., 38Ziegler M. Xiao R. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4233-4239Google Scholar). Activity measurements showed that NEM incorporation, into either the γ subunit, or into Cys-381 of β, or both, activated the enzyme more than 2-fold. In contrast, CM modification of one or both sites caused essentially full inhibition (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Effect of maleimides on the ATPase activity of mutants. ECF1 preparations equilibrated in MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10% glycerol, 2.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM EDTA were incubated with 100 µM NEM (hatched), CM (cross-hatched), or BM. The ATPase activity determined after 3 h incubation with the different maleimides is presented relative to the basal unmodified enzyme (open).

(10Duncan T.M. Zhou Y. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Trans. Biochem. Soc. 1995; 23 (a): 736-740Google Scholar, 11Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92 (b): 10964-10968Google Scholar) used a mutant βD380C/γC87S to distinguish which of the two Cys in the γ subunit (Cys-87 or Cys-112) was involved in disulfide bond cross-linking between γ and the β DELSEED region. Following the same approach, we constructed the mutant βE381C/γC87S/εS108C to identify which of the intrinsic Cys in γ was being reacted by maleimides. There was reactivity of the β subunit in the Cys at 381 and modification of both δ and ε (via Cys-108) but no labeling of the γ subunit by CM in this mutant (Fig. 3, lanes 10 and 11). Therefore, Cys-87 must be the site of maleimide incorporation into the γ subunit. CM modification of the mutant βE381C/γC87S/εS108C reduced the ATPase activity by 90% (Fig. 2C). This inhibition is not due to modification of Cys-δ140 as discussed above. Moreover, CM modification of the ECF1 isolated from mutant εS108C had no effect on activity (result not shown). Therefore, it must be modification of Cys-381 in the DELSEED region of the β subunit that caused the observed inhibition of activity in this mutant. To explore the reactivity of Cys-87 more fully, the mutant βE381A was prepared. This change preserves the short side chain but avoids a maleimide-reactive cysteine in the β subunit. The reactivity of Cys-87 with CM under different nucleotide conditions is shown in Fig. 3 (lanes 1-8). There was rapid and strong incorporation of CM in EDTA + ATP, EDTA + ADP, or AMP·PNP + Mg2+, a low incorporation of reagent in EDTA or Mg2+ alone, but essentially no modification of γ with Mg2++ ADP-bound, either when added directly, or as generated on the protein by addition of ATP + Mg2+ followed by enzyme turnover. Reaction of the γ subunit with NEM in enzyme from the mutant βE381A had no effect on activity. In contrast, CM modification caused almost 2.5-fold activation of the ATPase activity (Fig. 2D) compared with almost full inhibition when both Cys-87 and the Cys at residue 381 of β were modified. The reactivity of CM was monitored in ECF1 from the mutant βE381A that had been freed of ε subunit by affinity chromatography with a monoclonal antibody against the ε subunit (Dunn, 12Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 35-42Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that Cys-87 is labeled by CM under all nucleotide conditions including ADP + Mg2+ or AMP·PNP + Mg2+. This site was also labeled by CM in EDTA or Mg2+ alone (results not shown). The ATPase activity of the ε-free ECF1 from mutant βE381A was high, i.e. 70 µmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min per mg. There was no significant increase in the activity on reaction of CM (Fig. 2E), in contrast to the activation observed with enzyme that had not been freed of ε subunit. In another set of experiments, the effect of removing the ε subunit on the inhibition of ATPase activity by CM was investigated in the mutant βE381C/γC87S/εS108C. As shown in Fig. 2F, CM inhibited ε-free ECF1 from this mutant. Therefore, it is the interaction between β and γ, rather than between β and ε, which is perturbed when the Cys at residue 381 of β is reacted with CM. ECF1F0 purified from the mutant βE381A had normal ATPase activity, i.e. around 20 µmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min per mg protein, which was inhibited to 90% by 50 µM dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, results similar to those obtained with wild-type enzyme. Reaction of this preparation with CM gave a similar pattern of labeling to that with ECF1 from this mutant, i.e. strong labeling of the γ subunit in AMP·PNP + Mg2+, but little or none in Mg2+ alone, or in ADP + Mg2+ (result not shown). There was also some reaction of the reagent with the δ subunit, but no significant reaction of the intrinsic Cys in the b subunit under the labeling conditions employed. Fig. 2G summarizes the effects on the ATPase activity of modification by three different maleimides. Modification by NEM, CM, and BM all led to an inhibition of activity that was not seen with wild-type ECF1F0, indicating that the effect is due to reaction of Cys-87 and not Cys-140 of the δ subunit. The highest amount of inhibition was with the BM (more than 90%). Cys-87 is at the end of a short α helix of the γ subunit that interacts with the so-called DELSEED region of the β subunit (Abrahams et al. 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar). We have found that Cys-87 can be cross-linked in essentially 100% yield by disulfide bond formation to a Cys replacing Glu at 381 (Aggeler et al., 6Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Google Scholar), indicating the close proximity of the two residues, consistent with the ∼ 4-Å spacing from side chain S to S, estimated from the x-ray structural data (Abrahams et al., 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar). Cys-87 is buried in wild-type ECF1 and ECF1F0. However, when Glu-381 of the β subunit is exchanged for a smaller and uncharged side chain, such as Cys or Ala, this residue of γ becomes exposed for reaction with maleimides at least as large as CM. This exposure is nucleotide-dependent. In enzyme from which catalytic site nucleotide has been removed, Cys-87 is essentially buried. Addition of nucleotide, either ADP or ATP in the presence of EDTA, exposes Cys-87 for reaction with various maleimides. In the absence of Mg2+, the binding constants for nucleotide in each of the three catalytic sites, including that in the β which is linked to the short α helix of γ, is around 100 µM (Weber et al., 36Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Google Scholar; Grüber and Capaldi, 19Grüber G. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3875-3879Google Scholar), similar to that of isolated β subunit, suggesting an open arrangement of the sites (as in βE in the structure of MF1). In the presence of Mg2+, Cys-87 is exposed when ATP is bound, as demonstrated by the data for AMP·PNP, but the residue is buried in ADP or ADP + Pi. It appears, therefore, that the short α helix undergoes a release or reorganization that exposes Cys-87 when the catalytic sites are all open, or when ATP is bound, and that this is reversed on ATP hydrolysis. A conformational change of the γ subunit related to ATP binding and hydrolysis has been seen previously by changes in cross-linking from a Cys introduced at position 8 of the γ subunit (in the long N-terminal α helix) with the β subunit(s) (Aggeler and Capaldi, 3Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14576-14578Google Scholar). This process has also been followed by fluorescence changes of CM bound to either the Cys introduced at position 8 or another Cys introduced at residue 106 of the γ subunit (Turina and Capaldi, 33Turina P. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (a): 13465-13471Google Scholar, 34Turina P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (b): 14275-14280Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements under unisite catalysis conditions showed that the conformational change in the γ subunit occurs with bond cleavage of ATP to product ADP·Pi, rather than with Pi release (Turina and Capaldi, 33Turina P. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (a): 13465-13471Google Scholar, 34Turina P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (b): 14275-14280Google Scholar). Importantly, the conformational rearrangements observed here by changes in the reaction of Cys-87 were lost on removal of the ε subunit. Without the ε subunit bound, Cys-87 is exposed for reaction under all nucleotide conditions, including when catalytic sites are empty. The conformational changes observed for Cys-8 by cross-linking and from both Cys-8 and Cys-106 by fluorescence measurements were also lost when the ε subunit was removed (Aggeler and Capaldi, 3Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14576-14578Google Scholar; Turina and Capaldi, 33Turina P. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (a): 13465-13471Google Scholar). The enzyme continues to show highly cooperative ATPase activity in the absence of the ε subunit. The implication, therefore, is that the ε subunit in some way controls or regulates structural changes in the γ subunit, and these changes are likely a part of the energy transduction mechanism. The second interesting aspect of the reactivity of Cys-87 is the effect on activity of the enzyme. When Glu-381 is replaced by an Ala, reaction of Cys-87 with NEM has very little effect in isolated ECF1, whereas incorporation of CM activates the enzyme around 2.5-fold. This activation is related to ε subunit binding, as it is lost when the ε subunit is removed. By contrast, the reaction of Cys-87 in ECF1F0 with either NEM or CM leads to inhibition of ATPase activity by 50% or more, while modification by BM induces almost full inhibition. These results for ECF1 and ECF1F0 can be compared with data for CF1 and CF1F0. In the chloroplast enzyme, the equivalent residue of Cys-87, numbered Cys-89, is reactive to NEM even with a Glu in the DELSEED region (McCarty and Fagan, 26McCarty R.E. Fagan J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1503-1507Google Scholar; Moroney et al., 28Moroney J.V. Fullmer C.S. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7281-7285Google Scholar; Soteropoulos et al., 31Soteropoulos P. Ong A.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19810-19816Google Scholar). Reaction of NEM with Cys-89 occurs in thylakoid membranes when these are energized by light (i.e. when ATP is being made) and does not occur in the dark (with ADP bound) (McCarty and Fagan, 26McCarty R.E. Fagan J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1503-1507Google Scholar). However, CF1 isolated from thylakoids modified with NEM in the light is inhibited by the reagent, as is the ATPase activity of the membrane-bound enzyme (Soteropoulos et al., 31Soteropoulos P. Ong A.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19810-19816Google Scholar). Recent results by Soteropoulos et al. (31Soteropoulos P. Ong A.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19810-19816Google Scholar) have shown an altered affinity of catalytic sites for ADP in CF1 that has been modified with NEM, leading these authors to propose that inhibition is due to altered binding of nucleotides in one, or more, catalytic sites. This cannot explain the activity effects with ECF1, as the modification of Cys-87 by CM activates the enzyme when the ε subunit is present and gives the same activity as unmodified enzyme in ε-free ECF1. Rather, the effect of modification of Cys-87 seems to be a steric effect, based on the results with ECF1F0 from the mutant βE381A, where inhibition occurs with any of the maleimides used. Studies with the mutant βE381C/γC87S/εS108C also point to the importance of steric constraints for conformational changes involving the short α helix of γ and DELSEED region of β. Modification of a Cys-at 381 in the β subunit with NEM activated, whereas reaction of this site with CM causes a dramatic inhibition of activity. Taken together, the nucleotide dependence and activity effects suggest that there is a loosening and possibly a release of the γ subunit at its catch region with a β subunit on ATP binding, which is reversed on ADP formation. Such a release, followed by rebinding, may be a part of coupling catalytic sites with the proton channel and would be a necessary step if the γ subunit moves relative to the α3β3 domain, as suggested by the structural features of the enzyme (Abrahams et al., 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar) and as visualized by electron microscopy (Gogol et al., 18Gogol E.P. Johnston E. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9585-9589Google Scholar) and, more recently, by biochemical methods (Duncan et al., 10Duncan T.M. Zhou Y. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Trans. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2019428712,"In T cells, cell surface expression of CD45, a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, is required for T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction. Indirect evidence suggests that CD45 function in TCR signaling involves the dephosphorylation of the C-terminal negative regulatory site of p56lck, Tyr-505. To evaluate the importance of CD45-mediated dephosphorylation of p56lck Tyr-505 in TCR signaling, we established CD45− Jurkat cell lines expressing various forms of a chimera containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) fused to p56lck. We report that an activated EGFR/Lck chimera is able to reconstitute a Ca2+ response after CD3 stimulation in the absence of CD45 expression. In addition, the wild-type and kinase inactive versions of the EGFR/Lck chimera fail to restore early signaling. Restoration of the response by EGFR/LckF505 required EGF binding to the chimeric kinase. Altogether, these results provide the first direct evidence that the lack of efficient dephosphorylation of p56lck Tyr-505 is, in part, responsible for the unresponsiveness of CD45− cells. They also indicate that a second event is required for p56lck function in TCR signaling in addition to its dephosphorylation at Tyr-505."

A ∼90-base pair (bp) DNA fragment containing a 32-bp PMR element termed M-PMR3 was subcloned into a recombinant vector. This fragment conferred S1 nuclease sensitivity on the resulting supercoiled plasmid. High resolution mapping of sites reactive to S1 and P1 nucleases demonstrates that cleavage occurs within the M-PMR3 element. High resolution mapping with chemical agents selective for non-B DNA provides evidence that M-PMR3 adopts an H-DNA structure (intramolecular triple helix) in the less common H-y5 isomer at low pH. This result is observed in the presence or absence of Mg2+. Mutation of the native M-PMR3 element to create perfect homopurine/homopyrimidine mirror symmetry alters the preferred folding to the more common H-y3 triplex DNA isomer. These results demonstrate that imperfections in mirror symmetry can alter the relative stabilities of different H-DNA isomers. Similar imperfect purine/pyrimidine mirror repeat (PMR) elements have previously been identified upstream of the human MUC1 mucin and CFTR genes. These elements confer S1 nuclease sensitivity on isolated plasmid DNA at low pH.

These results demonstrate that imperfections in mirror symmetry can alter the relative stabilities of different H-DNA isomers. The human MUC1 gene encodes the core protein of a mucin-like molecule that is constitutively expressed by differentiated secretory epithelial cells of the breast, pancreas, prostrate, lungs, bladder, vas deferens, and other organs (1Zotter S. Hageman P.C. Lossnitzer A. Mooi W.J. Hilgers J. Cancer Rev. 1988; 12: 55-101Google Scholar). The MUC1 gene is overexpressed (relative to the normal epithelial cells) by many adenocarcinomas that arise in these organ sites (1Zotter S. Hageman P.C. Lossnitzer A. Mooi W.J. Hilgers J. Cancer Rev. 1988; 12: 55-101Google Scholar, 2Chambers J.A. Hollingsworth M.A. Trezise A.E.O. Harris A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 415-424Google Scholar, 3Hollingsworth M.A. Strawhecker J.M. Caffrey T.C.

Although their patterns of expression are not identical, MUC1 is expressed by several cell types that also express the cystic fibrosis gene product, CFTR 1The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorbpbase pair(s)CAAchloroacetaldehydeDEPdiethylpyrocarbonateDMSdimethyl sulfateMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidM-PMR332-bp PMR element centered at 118 bp relative to the transcription start point of the human MUC1 geneOTosmium tetroxidePMRpurine/pyrimidine mirror repeatRA or GYC or T.

Thus, promoter elements that control tissue-specific expression of genes in the secretory epithelial cell types in which MUC1 is expressed may be of use in the design of vectors for human gene therapy of adenocarcinomas, cystic fibrosis, and other diseases of secretory epithelia. Some basal elements that regulate transcription of MUC1 have been identified (6Abe M. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 282-286Google Scholar, 7Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D.

Upon scanning the proximal promoter regions of the human CFTR and MUC1 genes for shared sequence elements, several regions of purine/pyrimidine bias were noted. Some of these homopurine/homopyrimidine elements displayed imperfect mirror symmetry and are here termed purine/pyrimidine mirror repeats (PMRs). Previous studies of the region upstream of the MUC1 transcription start site identified three imperfect PMRs, M-PMR1 (27 bp, centered at −627), M-PMR2 (17 bp, centered at −244), and M-PMR3 (32 bp, centered at −118). Two imperfect PMRs in the CFTR promoter are similar to those in the MUC1 promoter, C-PMR1 (36 bp, centered at −170) and C-PMR2 (18 bp, centered at −468). The results of S1 nuclease hypersensitivity studies showed that non-B DNA structures arose within C-PMR1 and M-PMR3 under conditions of supercoiling and acidic pH (9Hollingsworth M. Closken C. Harris A. McDonald C. Pahwa G. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1138-1146Google Scholar). S1 nuclease hypersensitivity mapping to a PMR is strong evidence for the formation of H-DNA (reviewed in 10Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Google Scholar). H-DNA refers to a family of structures characterized by an intramolecular DNA triple helix and regions of base unpairing that confer sensitivity to chemical and enzymatic probes of single-stranded character in DNA. Stable H-DNA structures require some degree of mirror symmetry and are typically stabilized by supercoiling. Different H-DNA isomers arise from the formation of two mutually exclusive families of triple helices (Y·R·Y, pyrimidine motif; R·R·Y, purine motif). Perfect PMRs formally have the potential to adopt four different isomers (H-y3, H-y5, H-r3, and H-r5), depending on which half-element strand is donated to the intramolecular triplex (reviewed in 10Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Google Scholar). These isomers typically have very different energies, with the equilibrium strongly favoring one isomer, often H-y3. NMR spectroscopy has provided key information concerning the structures of triple-helical domains of H-DNA (11Radhakrishnan I. Patel D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11405-11416Google Scholar). Although H-DNA can be detected under a variety of conditions using isolated plasmid DNA, it has only been detected under extreme conditions in bacteria (12Kohwi Y. Malkhosyan S. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 817-822Google Scholar), and it has never been demonstrated in living eukaryotes. On the other hand, perfect PMR sequences predicted to form very stable H-DNA structures (under appropriate conditions) are statistically over-represented in the human genome (relative to yeast and Escherichia coli), with a frequency of once every 49 kilobase pairs (13Schroth G.P. Ho P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1977-1983Google Scholar). An antibody preparation thought to be specific for triplex DNA binds to metaphase chromosomes in fixed mammalian cells (14Lee J.S. Burkholder G.D. Latimer L.J.P. Haug B.L. Braun R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; : 1047-1061Google Scholar). In addition, PMRs have frequently been identified upstream of genes, a provocative location that suggests a possible role in transcriptional regulation. The identification of imperfect PMR sequences upstream of the human CFTR and MUC1 genes suggested that these sequences could form H-DNA. In previous experiments we demonstrated that these sites become sensitive to S1 nuclease at low pH (9Hollingsworth M. Closken C. Harris A. McDonald C. Pahwa G. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1138-1146Google Scholar). Subsequent high resolution studies of the PMR element upstream of the CFTR gene detected the presence of a non-B DNA structure related to the H-y3 isomer of H-DNA at low pH (13Schroth G.P. Ho P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1977-1983Google Scholar). In related work, single-strand-specific nuclear proteins were detected in nuclear extracts from cultured human cell lines (9Hollingsworth M. Closken C. Harris A. McDonald C. Pahwa G. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1138-1146Google Scholar). One of these factors, a 27-kDa protein, bound preferentially to purine-rich single strands including those within the PMRs from the CFTR and MUC1 genes, suggesting the possibility that this factor could stabilize certain unpaired DNA structures. In the present study we more fully characterize the non-B DNA structure responsible for S1 nuclease sensitivity of M-PMR3. Subcloning of a ∼90-bp DNA fragment containing the 32-bp M-PMR3 element into plasmid pGEM-4Z (Promega) was performed after polymerase chain reaction using plasmid pMAH5 (9Hollingsworth M. Closken C. Harris A. McDonald C. Pahwa G. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1138-1146Google Scholar) and primers 5′-GCAAGCTTGCCCTTGTACCCTACCCAG and 5′-GCGAATTCGAGCAGGTGACAGGTGACAA to install EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites at the termini of this element. Insertion of the indicated fragment between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pGEM-4Z produced pM-PMR3. To construct pM-PMR3*, the same primers were used to amplify a region of plasmid pM-PMR3super 2G. S. Pahwa and M. A. Hollingsworth, submitted for publication. containing the M-PMR3 element modified to create perfect homopurine/homopyrimidine mirror symmetry. The resulting DNA fragment was cleaved with HindIII and EcoRI and ligated into pGEM-3Z. Plasmid DNA at native superhelical density was extracted from DH5α cells and purified by CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in the presence of ethidium bromide (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). S1 and P1 nucleases were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. To map plasmid sites sensitive to double-strand cleavage by S1 nuclease, 2 µg of supercoiled DNA was treated in 50-µl reactions containing 30 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM ZnCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 75 units of S1 nuclease. Reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min and then stopped by the addition of 10 µl of a solution containing 0.4 M Tris base and 0.25 M EDTA. Reactions were then diluted to 100 µl with H2O, extracted with phenol, and precipitated using ethanol. For some experiments, the resulting DNA was resuspended and treated with ScaI endonuclease. For high resolution experiments, 5-µg samples of supercoiled plasmid pM-PMR3 were sparingly nicked by nuclease treatment at 37°C for 30 min in 50-µl reactions at either pH 4.5 (0.3 units of S1 nuclease or 0.004 units of P1 nuclease) or pH 7.1 (0.4 units of P1 nuclease). Reactions at pH 4.5 contained 20 mM sodium acetate, 4 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM NaCl. Reactions at pH 7.1 contained 25 mM MOPS, 4 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM NaCl. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 µl of chilled H2O, extracted with phenol, and precipitated with ethanol. Anhydrous hydrazine, CAA (50 wt % solution in H2O), DEP, DMS, 2,2′-dipyridyl, formic acid, OT (4 wt % solution in H2O), and piperidine were obtained from Aldrich and were used without further purification. Chemical probing of supercoiled pM-PMR3 was performed using modifications of published procedures (17Pestov D. Dayn A. Siyanova E. George D. Mirkin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6527-6532Google Scholar). Supercoiled DNA samples (10 µg) were dissolved in 100 µl of pH 4.5 or pH 7.1 buffers (described above). For CAA reactivity, duplicate plasmid samples were treated with 2 µl of CAA solution (∼0.12 M final concentration) at 37°C for 1 h. For DEP reactivity, plasmid samples were treated with 3 µl of DEP (∼0.2 M final concentration) at 24°C for 30 min with agitation. For OT reactivity, plasmid samples were treated for 15 min at 37°C with 7.6 µl of a solution made by mixing 14.2 µl of 0.5% 2,2′-dipyridyl and 3 µl of OT solution (final concentrations of both OT and 2,2′-dipyridyl were ∼2 mM). Reactions were terminated by two ethanol precipitations. For DMS reactivity, plasmid samples were treated for 90 s at 24°C with 10 µl of a fresh 5% aqueous solution of DMS (48 mM final concentration). DMS reactions were terminated by the addition of 25 µl of DMS stop solution (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), followed by two ethanol precipitations. Enzyme-treated or chemically modified pM-PMR3 or pM-PMR3* DNA was treated with HindIII and EcoRI to release the corresponding ∼90-bp fragment containing the M-PMR3 or M-PMR3* elements. These fragments were purified by electrophoresis through a native 5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by elution and sequential precipitations using ethanol and spermine (18Hoopes B. McClure W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5493-5504Google Scholar). The restriction fragments were selectively radiolabeled on one terminus of either the purine-rich or pyrimidine-rich strand using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and appropriate [32P]deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. After precipitation with spermine, untreated and CAA-treated samples were then treated with either piperidine formate (pH 2) or hydrazine in high salt followed by sequential ethanol precipitations to provide purine or C > T sequence ladders (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chemically modified DNA samples were then treated with 100 µl of 10% (v/v) piperidine at 90°C for 30 min, frozen, and lyophilized overnight. Samples containing equivalent amounts of radioactivity were analyzed by electrophoresis through denaturing 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Radioactive signals were imaged and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Single-hit kinetics were verified by detection of greater than 70% of total radioactivity in the full-length DNA fragment. In previous experiments, we studied the S1 nuclease sensitivity of DNA fragments derived from the CFTR and MUC1 gene promoters (9Hollingsworth M. Closken C. Harris A. McDonald C. Pahwa G. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1138-1146Google Scholar). In these studies supercoiled (but not linearized) plasmids containing a MUC1 promoter fragment that included both the M-PMR2 and M-PMR3 elements displayed S1 nuclease hypersensitivity mapping in this region, whereas a plasmid containing M-PMR1 did not. The sequence of M-PMR3 is similar to the S1 nuclease sensitive C-PMR1 element from the human CFTR promoter. We therefore sought to determine if M-PMR3 displayed S1 nuclease sensitivity when isolated from the MUC1 promoter. A ∼90-bp DNA fragment containing M-PMR3 was removed from the MUC1 promoter and placed into a plasmid vector (Fig. 1) to create pM-PMR3. To detect non-B DNA in pM-PMR3, supercoiled pM-PMR3 plasmid DNA or the supercoiled vector (lacking the M-PMR3 insert) were treated with S1 nuclease as shown in Fig. 2A. Supercoiled vector and pM-PMR3 plasmids comigrate (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 5). Linearization with ScaI provides the reference band shown in lanes 2 and 6 of Fig. 2A. Treatment of supercoiled DNA with S1 nuclease at pH 4.5 caused substantial nicking and linearization of both vector and pM-PMR3 plasmids, indicating that both contained one or more non-B DNA structures (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 7). To precisely map sites of S1 nuclease sensitivity, S1-treated plasmids were digested with ScaI to cleave the plasmid DNA at a unique site. These results are shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 4 and 8). Analysis of the estimated lengths of released DNA fragments indicates that the S1 cleavage site in the vector DNA lies near the origin of replication (Fig. 2A, lane 4), as indicated by (I) in Fig. 2B. A cruciform structure can be extruded at this site during the alkaline lysis plasmid preparation procedure (19Lilley D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6468-6472Google Scholar, 20Tomizawa J. Cell. 1984; 38: 861-870Google Scholar). In contrast, S1 sensitivity maps within the MUC1 promoter insert in pM-PMR3 (compare Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 8). Fragment length analysis maps the S1 cleavage site to site (II) as shown in Fig. 2B. Thus, as previously observed for the C-PMR1 element from the human CFTR gene (21McDonald C.D. Hollingsworth M.A. Maher L.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 267-274Google Scholar), insertion of the PMR into a plasmid vector alters the major site of S1 nuclease attack. S1 sensitivity initially mapping to the plasmid origin is completely replaced by S1 sensitivity mapping to the PMR element. Samples of plasmid pM-PMR3 were treated with limiting amounts of S1 nuclease at pH 4.5 or P1 nuclease at pH 4.5 or 7.1 to allow high resolution mapping of the nuclease-sensitive sites. Nicked DNA from the region of the M-PMR3 insert was isolated, labeled uniquely on one strand, denatured, and analyzed on sequencing gels as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are shown in Fig. 3. The data in Fig. 3 reveal several patterns of nuclease sensitivity. First, a non-B DNA conformation occurs in the M-PMR3 element at pH 4.5 as detected by the S1 nuclease sensitivity of both DNA strands (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 14). Cleavage by S1 nuclease occurs only within boundaries of the M-PMR3 element. On the purine (R) strand, cleavage is centered on the center of mirror symmetry and is particularly notable at the sites of imperfection in this symmetry (Fig. 3, lane 5). Cleavage on the pyrimidine (Y) strand is more subtle, limited to the 5′-half of the element and occurs most clearly at sites of mirror imperfection (Fig. 3, lane 14). Second, at pH 4.5, P1 nuclease cleaves weakly to produce a somewhat different pattern of sites than S1 (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 16). To address non-B DNA structures at neutral pH, levels of P1 nuclease were increased to produce the same overall plasmid nicking at pH 7.1 as had occurred at pH 4.5 (data not shown). In no case were nicks observed in or near the M-PMR3 element, demonstrating that the non-B DNA structure in this region was absolutely dependent on low pH (Fig. 3, lanes 8, 9, 17, and 18). S1 and P1 nucleases therefore identify a non-B DNA conformation within M-PMR3 that is stabilized by protons. We further characterized the non-B conformation of the native M-PMR3 element using four chemical probes of unpaired bases previously shown to be of value in detecting non-B DNA structures (17, 22-25, for a review see 26Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Google Scholar). DMS is sensitive to Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding because the N7 position of guanine is protected from methylation by DMS if guanine N7 is involved in a stable hydrogen bond (e.g. C+·G·C triplet). CAA preferentially reacts with adenine and cytosine (and to a lesser extent, guanine) to form their etheno derivatives when these bases occur in an unpaired or strained context, whereas DEP reacts with unpaired or strained purine residues (including, but not limited to, Z-DNA). OT reacts primarily with unpaired thymine bases. DMS reactivity of guanines in the purine strand is not greatly different between pH 4.5 and pH 7.1 (Fig. 4, compare lanes 4 and 5). However, methylation appears slightly suppressed over the 5′-half of the element relative to the 3′-half (Fig. 4, lane 4). Complete protection of guanine N7 atoms within a putative intramolecular triplex may require that the structure be extremely stable. CAA reactivities on the purine strand are best seen when superimposed with the C > T chemistry (Fig. 4, compare lanes 8 and 9). At low pH, bases attacked by CAA clearly map only to purines on the 3′-half of the M-PMR3 element (Fig. 4, lane 8). No reactivity is observed at neutral pH. On the pyrimidine strand, CAA reactivity is best visualized when superimposed with A + G chemistry (Fig. 4, compare lanes 22 and 23). In this case, CAA reaction marks the two A residues that create imperfections in mirror symmetry on the 5′-half of the pyrimidine strand. No CAA hyperreactivity is observed at pH 7.1 DEP treatment at pH 4.5 modified bases in a pattern very similar to that observed for CAA (Fig. 4, compare lanes 8 and 10, and lanes 22 and 26). These results are consistent with hyperreactivity of the 3′-half of the purine strand relative to the 5′-half, and emphasize the unique reactivity of A residues creating imperfections in mirror symmetry on the 5′-half of the pyrimidine strand (Fig. 4, lane 26). No DEP hyperreactivity is observed at pH 7.1 (Fig. 4, lane 27). OT provides the most distinct signature within M-PMR3 at pH 4.5. This reagent strongly reacts with two T residues that create imperfections in the 3′-half of the purine strand of M-PMR3 (Fig. 4, lane 12) but does not identify these T residues at pH 7.1. T residues near the center of mirror symmetry on the pyrimidine strand are highly reactive to OT, as is a single T residue at position −101 just beyond the 5′-border or M-PMR3 on the pyrimidine strand (Fig. 1; Fig. 4, lane 28). The stability of non-B DNA structures can depend on the nature and concentration of divalent cations (27Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3781-3785Google Scholar, 28Bernués J. Beltran R. Casasnovas J. Azorin F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4067-4073Google Scholar). Our initial experiments included 4 mM Mg2+, previously shown to enhance S1 nuclease reactivity of the C-PMR1 element (21McDonald C.D. Hollingsworth M.A. Maher L.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 267-274Google Scholar). To explore the importance of Mg2+ in stabilizing the non-B DNA structure within M-PMR3, patterns of CAA and OT reactivity were compared at pH 4.5 in the presence and absence of 4 mM MgCl2 (Fig. 5). Hyperreactivity to CAA is observed for certain bases within M-PMR3 independent of the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 5, compare lanes 3, 4, and 5). In contrast, the extent of OT modification of bases on the pyrimidine strand of M-PMR3 was significantly enhanced in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 5, compare lanes 9 and 10). These data suggest that the non-B structure in M-PMR3 can be stabilized by 4 mM Mg2+ but does not require its presence. To create a reasonable model for the non-B DNA structure formed by M-PMR3 under conditions of supercoiling and low pH, nuclease and chemical sensitivity data are summarized in Fig. 6. This analysis shows that many probes of non-B structure recognize sequences near the center of M-PMR3. Moreover, most of the reactive sites in the element map above the center of mirror symmetry in Fig. 6. This corresponds to the 5′-half of the pyrimidine strand and the 3′-half of the purine strand. Bases in the opposite half of the element (3′-half of the pyrimidine strand and 5′-half of the purine strand) appear to remain paired. These data were used to discriminate between H-DNA models representing the conventional H-y3 and H-y5 isomers. The pH dependence and divalent cation independence of the M-PMR3 structure suggest that H-r isomers are not formed. Fig. 8, A and B, demonstrates that major sites of reactivity probes specific for non-B DNA (boxed residues) are consistent with an H-y5 structure (Fig. 8B) but not with an H-y3 structure (Fig. 8A). Previous studies of H-DNA formation in PMR elements with perfect mirror symmetry have concluded that the H-y3 isomer is typically favored for energetic and/or kinetic reasons (10Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Google Scholar, 21McDonald C.D. Hollingsworth M.A. Maher L.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 267-274Google Scholar, 22Htun H. Dahlberg J. Science. 1988; 241: 1791-1796Google Scholar, 29Htun H. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1989; 243: 1571-1576Google Scholar). We reasoned that the preference of M-PMR3 for the H-y5 isomer of H-DNA might be related to the imperfect mirror symmetry of M-PMR3. We therefore created a modified form of M-PMR3 in which the mirror symmetry of the element has been made perfect by deleting two T residues that interrupted mirror symmetry and adding two residues near the center of mirror symmetry. This corrected element is termed M-PMR3*, and its sequence is depicted in Fig. 1. To test the hypothesis that M-PMR3* would adopt the more conventional H-y3 isomer at low pH, high resolution assays of reactivity to OT, DEP, and CAA were performed with this element. These data are shown in Fig. 7 and are summarized in Fig. 8, C and D. OT reactivity with the purine strand of M-PMR3* was limited to two T residues just outside the boundaries of the element (Fig. 7, lane 3). DEP reactivity with the purine strand mapped to the center and 5′-border of the element (Fig. 7, lane 5). Interestingly, traces of DEP reactivity were also observed in samples treated at pH 7.1, suggesting that the stability of the non-B structure of M-PMR3* was enhanced at neutral pH relative to that of M-PMR3. CAA reactivity with the purine strand of M-PMR3* was limited to the 5′-half of the element (Fig. 7, lane 7). As was observed for DEP, some residual CAA reactivity was detected at pH 7.1 (Fig. 7, compare lanes 7 and 8). It is noteworthy that DEP and CAA reactivity was not evenly distributed within the purine region predicted to be unstructured in the H-y3 isomer (Fig. 8C). This behavior is similar to the uneven reactivity of the purine strand of M-PMR3 (Fig. 8B) and that previously observed within a PMR element in the CFTR gene promoter (21McDonald C.D. Hollingsworth M.A. Maher L.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 267-274Google Scholar). These observations suggest that nucleotides presumed to be “unstructured” are actually constrained by folding or packing against the intramolecular triplex such that only a subset of the sequence is exposed. The pyrimidine strand of M-PMR3* was uniformly unreactive to DEP and CAA (Fig. 7, lanes 14-19). OT strongly reacted with the four T residues proximal to the center of mirror symmetry but with no other T residues of the pyrimidine strand (Fig. 7, lane 12). Chemical probing data for M-PMR3* were recorded and mapped onto conventional H-y3 and H-y5 models for H-DNA. The result is shown in Fig. 8, C and D. In contrast to the reactivity of the native M-PMR3 sequence, the pattern of M-PMR3* reactivity suggests an H-y3 structure. This result is consistent with other studies in which PMR elements with perfect mirror symmetry have been shown to favor the H-y3 isomer. This result confirms the hypothesis that that the unusual folding of M-PMR3 is related to its imperfect mirror symmetry. The best-studied examples of PMR sequences capable of adopting H-DNA structures display perfect mirror symmetry and are repetitive in nature, such as d(GA)16-18 (22Htun H. Dahlberg J.

Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10652-10658Google Scholar). The short PMR elements in the human CFTR and MUC1 gene promoters are not simple sequence repeats and contain imperfections in mirror symmetry. Both C-PMR1 and M-PMR3 are hypersensitive to S1 nuclease and other probes of unpaired bases at low pH. A previous study involving high resolution chemical and enzymatic probing of C-PMR1 indicated that the reactivity of this element resembled H-DNA in some ways (e.g. unpaired nucleotides at the center of mirror symmetry) but did not clearly conform with either H-y3 or H-y5 isomer. In contrast, the present chemical and enzymatic reactivity data for the native M-PMR3 element are quite clearly diagnostic of the H-y5 isomer. The original studies of PMR sequences at low pH and native levels of supercoiling clearly demonstrated that the H-y3 isomer is favored over the H-y5 isomer (22Htun H. Dahlberg J.

Lyamichev V. Voloshin O. Frank-Kamenetskii M. Palacek E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 295-299Google Scholar). A plausible explanation for this preference involves details of strand rearrangements in each isomer. Topological modeling suggests that the H-y3 isomer releases one extra supercoil relative to the H-y5 isomer (29Htun H. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1989; 243: 1571-1576Google Scholar). However, details of divalent ion conditions and the exact nucleotide sequence of the loop region can influence the equilibrium between isomers (35Kang S. Wohlrab F. Wells R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1259-1264Google Scholar, 36Kang S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20889-20891Google Scholar, 37Shimuzu M. Kubo K. Matsumoto U. Shindo H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 185-197Google Scholar). The data obtained for the native M-PMR3 element conform to the more rare H-y5 isomer. Although initially unexpected, this preference may be understood by referring to the putative structures shown in Fig. 8 (compare A and B). Because of the presence of two T residues in the 3′-half of the purine-rich strand of the PMR, folding into the H-y3 isomer creates a situation in which the Hoogsteen strand of the putative triplex is too short to form continuous triplets (Fig. 8A). The resulting geometry is likely to be very unstable. In contrast, the H-y5 isomer accommodates the extra T residues in the more reactive 3′-half of the purine strand (Fig. 8B). A single A residue in the 5′-half of the pyrimidine strand is predicted to be extruded from the putative triplex, and this residue is indeed hyperreactive to DEP (Fig. 4, lane 26; Fig. 8B). Evidence for the role of sequence asymmetry in the H-y3:H-y5 equilibrium in M-PMR3 was obtained by studying H-DNA formation in the fully symmetric sequence, M-PMR3*. When sequence asymmetry in M-PMR3 was corrected in M-PMR3*, the element adopted a canonical H-y3 conformation. These results suggest that, together with ionic conditions and loop sequences, details of sequence asymmetry can determine the relative stabilities of H-y5 and H-y3 isomers. As is typical for PMR elements containing mixtures of G and A residues, cytosine protonation was important in stabilizing the non-B structure of M-PMR3. H-DNA was detected at pH 4.5 but not at pH 7.1. It is noteworthy that there was no evidence for H-r5 or H-r3 isomers (involving R·R·Y triplets) at neutral pH even in the presence of Mg2+. This element is therefore quite different from the d(G)30 sequence previously shown to switch between H-r3 and H-y3 isomers, depending on pH and the presence of Mg2+ (27Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3781-3785Google Scholar). That supercoiling was required for the S1 sensitivity of M-PMR3 was previously established (9Hollingsworth M. Closken C. Harris A. McDonald C. Pahwa G. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1138-1146Google Scholar). Possible functions for H-DNA structures have been proposed in the regulation of DNA replication (38Dayn A.

Unpaired nucleotides in H-DNA might be recognized by transcription factors, H-DNA formation might create a flexible hinge for chromatin folding, or the structure might act as a buffer for superhelical strain in transcription. Single-strand-specific DNA binding proteins that recognize homopurine or homopyrimidine sequences have been identified (9Hollingsworth M. Closken C. Harris A. McDonald C. Pahwa G. Maher L.J.

Mishima Y. Kominari R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6631-6635Google Scholar). Such factors might stabilize certain H-DNA isomers. Despite these intriguing possibilities, specific H-DNA structures have not been detected in eukaryotic cells, and the putative functions of H-DNA remain unknown. Indeed, when examined by genetic and biochemical experiments, PMRs have been shown to act as conventional B-form duplexes that may be recognized by DNA binding proteins (10Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M.

In the case of the short PMR elements in the promoters of the human CFTR and MUC1 mucin genes, little evidence is available from which to conclude whether H-DNA might be involved in the transcriptional regulation of these genes. Data from transient transfection experiments using promoter-reporter constructs suggest that M-PMR3 contains sequences that have a weakly negative effect on transcription initiation, since deletion of this element increased transcription in some cell lines. However, mirror symmetry may not be required for this activity.2 Combinations of genetic and biochemical studies will be needed to better address whether PMRs adopt H-DNA structures in living cells and to explore the function(s) of such structures.

Mutagenesis and crystal structure data from several nucleotide binding proteins, which also contain this sequence, showed the importance of the lysine and serine/threonine residues in nucleotide binding. We have studied the role of Lys-54 and Thr-55 in MgATP binding in the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase domain of rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase by site-directed mutagenesis. Lys-54 was mutated to methionine, whereas Thr-55 was mutated to valine, serine, and cysteine. Three mutants, Lys-54 to Met and Thr-55 to Cys or Val, displayed more than a 5000-fold decrease in 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity compared with the wild type. The mutations had no effect on fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase activity and did not affect the activation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase after phosphorylation by cyclic 3', 5'-AMP-dependent protein kinase. Binding experiments with ATP, ADP, and their analogs (3'-N-methylanthraniloyl derivatives) showed that these two residues do not play the same role. Lys-54 is involved in ATP binding, whereas Thr-55 is important for catalysis."

It has been speculated that forskolin interferes with the action of BFA by competition for the binding of BFA to its target protein, which is most likely the Golgi-localized nucleotide exchange factor specific for ADP-ribosylation factor 1. Here we show that in vitro forskolin does not prevent inhibition of Golgi-catalyzed nucleotide exchange by BFA. Therefore it appears unlikely that forskolin and BFA bind to the same target protein. Using [3H]BFA we have measured detoxification of BFA by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. BFA is secreted from CHO cells as cysteine and glutathione conjugates (Brüning, A., Ishikawa, T., Kneusel, R. E., Matern, U., Lottspeich, F., and Wieland, F. T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7726-7732). We present evidence that forskolin treatment of CHO cells results in increased levels of Cys-BFA, the major BFA conjugate secreted by CHO cells, in the medium. Elevated levels of Cys-BFA are also found intracellularly. The effect of forskolin is shown to be independent of its ability to raise the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP. Therefore, we suggest that the effect of forskolin on BFA-induced disassembly of the Golgi apparatus might be due to an enhanced detoxification of the drug.

In addition, forskolin has also been shown to bind to a number of membrane-spanning plasma membrane proteins including the glucose transporter (12Kashiwagi A. Hueckstadt T.P. Foley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13685-13692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (13McHugh E. McGee J.R.M. J. Biol.

Although these interactions are not well characterized it seems that forskolin inhibits the activities of these membrane transporters (18Laurenza A. Seamon K.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that forskolin both inhibits and reverses the effects of BFA on Golgi morphology and on sphingomyelin synthesis, respectively (1Lippincott S.J. Glickman J.

Forskolin action was shown to be independent of its ability to stimulate adenylyl cyclase (1Lippincott S.J. Glickman J. Donaldson J.G. Robbins J. Kreis T.E. Seamon K.B. Sheetz M.P. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since the action of forskolin was found to be dose-dependent and could be overcome by increased levels of BFA, it was proposed that forskolin and BFA act on the same target. This target of BFA has been described to be a Golgi-localized nucleotide exchange enzyme specific for ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (3Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 4Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 5Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a factor regulating this enzyme. These data could imply that forskolin is able to bind to the BFA target, thereby inhibiting BFA action. However, the BFA target has not yet been purified. Even direct cross-linking experiments with [3H]BFA did not reveal the identity of this factor (6Brüning A. Ishikawa T. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Lottspeich F. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7726-7732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of forskolin-binding proteins from Golgi-enriched subcellular fractions by use of a forskolin affinity matrix also did not result in the identification of a potential BFA target (data not shown). We now present data that indicate an indirect role of forskolin in maintaining the integrity of the Golgi apparatus in the presence of BFA. Employing an in vitro assay to reconstitute nucleotide exchange onto ARF we show that forskolin cannot rescue this activity by competition with BFA. Therefore, we conclude that the target of BFA might be different from that of forskolin. On the basis of a previously published assay (6Brüning A. Ishikawa T. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Lottspeich F. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7726-7732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we present evidence that treatment of cells with forskolin results in a significantly increased formation and secretion of Cys-BFA, the major conjugate secreted by CHO cells. Our results suggest that forskolin prevents the effects of BFA on the secretory pathway by stimulating detoxification of BFA rather than by interacting with proteins (e.g. the ARF-specific nucleotide exchange factor) that are involved in vesicular transport. Tritiated BFA (2.075 Ci/mmol) and its conjugates were synthesized and purified as described earlier (19Tietjen K.G. Hammer D. Matern U. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1985; 26: 241-257Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Forskolin was a generous gift of Dr. H. Metzger (Hoechst AG). [α-32P]GTP was from Amersham Corp. All cell culture reagents were from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade. This assay was performed exactly as described in Helms et al. (20Helms J.B. Palmer D.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) Purification of recombinant myristoylated ADP-ribosylation factor 1 and CHO Golgi membranes was as described by Balch et al. (21Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Preincubation with forskolin was as described in the legend to Fig. 1. CHO cells (ATCC CCL 61) were grown in suspension cultures in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 7.5% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 units of streptomycin per ml. For BFA secretion experiments cells were collected at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml and then resuspended in medium lacking fetal calf serum at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml. For kinetic experiments (see Fig. 2, A and B) 100 µl of cells were used per experimental condition. 10 µCi of [3H]BFA were added (final concentration, 13 µg of BFA/ml of medium), and aliquots of 10 µl were removed at the times indicated. Samples were centrifuged and pellets extracted with 10 µl of methanol/water (1:1). Cell extracts and the corresponding media were analyzed by TLC. In some experiments the total amounts of BFA, Cys-BFA, and GSH-BFA in cell extracts and the corresponding media were determined after 90 min of incubation (see Figs. 2C and 3). ATP depletion was performed by adding 50 mM deoxyglucose, 0.05% sodium azide for 15 min at 37°C right before addition of [3H]BFA. Where indicated cells were preincubated with forskolin (final concentration, 100 µM) for 1 h at 37°C before radiolabeled BFA was added. BFA and its conjugates were separated on Silica Gel 60 plates purchased from Merck. Chloroform/methanol/water/formic acid (10:10:3:0.6) was used as eluant. Radiolabeled BFA derivatives were analyzed either by fluorography according to 22Randerath K. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 188-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar or by the use of a two-dimensional TLC radio scanner (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Identification of Cys-BFA and GSH-BFA was by comparison to synthesized standards as well as by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (6Brüning A. Ishikawa T. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Lottspeich F. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7726-7732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of forskolin on Golgi-catalyzed nucleotide exchange onto ARF was investigated using the assay published by Helms and Rothman (4Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant ARF and isolated CHO Golgi membranes were incubated in the presence of [α-32P]GTP, and protein-bound radioactivity was measured. Concentrations of forskolin up to 250 µM did not affect the nucleotide exchange reaction to a significant extent (Fig. 1). In contrast, BFA is effective at submicromolar concentrations giving half-maximal inhibition between 2 and 5 µM. At 10 µM BFA nucleotide exchange was reduced to about 35% as compared with control values. The effect of forskolin was tested at concentrations of 100 and 250 µM, respectively. Under these conditions the concentration of forskolin is 10–125-fold higher than that of BFA. Thus, the excess of forskolin over BFA is similar to the in vivo experiments published by Lippincott et al. (1Lippincott S.J. Glickman J. Donaldson J.G. Robbins J. Kreis T.E. Seamon K.B. Sheetz M.P. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Even at the highest excess of forskolin over BFA no significant effect of forskolin could be observed (Fig. 1). Therefore, nucleotide exchange inhibited by BFA cannot be rescued by forskolin. From these results it seems very unlikely that forskolin prevents the in vivo effects of BFA by a direct interaction with the target of BFA. To investigate alternative mechanisms by which forskolin could prevent BFA action we considered the possibility that forskolin acts by stimulating the process of detoxification of BFA. For this purpose we employed a previously described assay, which monitors the detoxification of BFA by CHO cells (6Brüning A. Ishikawa T. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Lottspeich F. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7726-7732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BFA was shown to be secreted as cysteine and glutathione conjugates, respectively. When BFA is added to CHO cells, intracellularly formed conjugates are rapidly secreted. This mechanism has been suggested to be the basis of the observed reversibility of BFA action (6Brüning A. Ishikawa T. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Lottspeich F. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7726-7732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) upon removal of the drug. A typical BFA secretion experiment is shown in Fig. 2A. CHO cells were incubated with [3H]BFA at 37°C. At the times indicated aliquots were removed from the cell suspension, and the medium was analyzed by TLC. Cys-BFA and GSH-BFA are the major conjugates formed (identified by comparison with synthesized standards as described in Brüning et al. (6Brüning A. Ishikawa T. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Lottspeich F. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7726-7732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Secretion of BFA conjugates starts approximately 5–10 min after addition of [3H]BFA. After 90 min considerable amounts of both Cys-BFA and GSH-BFA are secreted into the medium. The amount of Cys-BFA in the medium is comparable with the amount of BFA found intracellularly (data not shown). There are at least three additional minor BFA derivatives secreted into the medium that have not yet been identified. Secretion of Cys-BFA is strongly reduced when cells are depleted of ATP (Fig. 2C; similar data were obtained for GSH-BFA, data not shown). In this experiment the amounts of Cys-BFA secreted into the medium after a 90-min incubation were analyzed. Cys-BFA is still secreted but at a largely reduced rate. This could indicate that the formation of BFA conjugates is dependent on ATP. Alternatively the ATP dependence of BFA conjugate secretion might indicate that BFA derivatives are actively secreted into the medium involving an ATP-driven pump localized to the plasma membrane. Since intracellular Cys-BFA is not accumulating under these conditions (Fig. 2C) and the ratio of intracellular versus extracellular Cys-BFA remains unchanged, these data seem to indicate that conjugate formation rather than secretion is affected. However, it cannot be excluded that conjugate secretion is ATP-dependent as the decrease of intracellular ATP might not be sufficient to inhibit a putative ABC transporter involved in BFA conjugate secretion. The experiments shown in Fig. 2, B and C, demonstrate that forskolin-treated cells are able to remove BFA more efficiently than untreated cells. CHO cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the presence or absence of 100 µM forskolin before the addition of [3H]BFA. At the times indicated the media were analyzed by TLC and the amounts of Cys-BFA and GSH-BFA quantified (not shown for GSH-BFA). After 90 min of incubation the amount of Cys-BFA in the medium was enhanced by a factor of ∼2 when cells were pretreated with forskolin. The intracellular level of Cys-BFA was also increased in the presence of forskolin (Fig. 2C). This indicates that forskolin treatment of CHO cells results in enhanced conjugation of BFA to cysteine. The formation of GSH-BFA was not affected by the addition of forskolin (data not shown). When cells were depleted of ATP, forskolin was no longer able to stimulate the formation of Cys-BFA (intracellular pool, Fig. 2C). Accordingly, the amounts of Cys-BFA found in the medium also remained unchanged (Fig. 2C). A membrane-permeating analogue of cyclic AMP, dibutyryl-cAMP, did not mimic the effects observed with forskolin (Fig. 3). Therefore, the stimulatory effect of forskolin on BFA conjugate formation is cAMP-independent. These data are consistent with the finding that forskolin can prevent the disassembly of the Golgi complex in the presence of BFA via a cAMP-independent mechanism (1Lippincott S.J. Glickman J. Donaldson J.G. Robbins J. Kreis T.E. Seamon K.B. Sheetz M.P. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and suggest that forskolin-enhanced detoxification prevents disassembly of the Golgi complex in the presence of BFA. After 90 min of incubation about 15% of radiolabeled BFA was found associated with cells (data not shown). The amount of BFA in the cells was similar to the amount of Cys-BFA in the medium. In forskolin-treated cells this amount of extracellular Cys-BFA was doubled although the total intracellular amount of BFA remained unchanged. How can forskolin reverse the effects of BFA in vivo if the intracellular level of BFA is not affected by forskolin? One explanation could be that only a small pool of intracellular BFA affects membrane traffic. When [3H]BFA was added to an H2O/octanol mixture (octanol is similar in hydrophobicity to biological membranes), only 0.4% of [3H]BFA could be recovered from the H2O phase. The presence of forskolin did not alter this distribution (data not shown) indicating that forskolin is not able to facilitate the release of BFA from membranes. From this phase distribution we consider it likely that the bulk of BFA is randomly dissolved in the cellular endomembrane system. BFA nonspecifically sticking to membranes may not contribute to the effect BFA exerts on membrane traffic and is not expected to be conjugated to cysteine or glutathione. If forskolin-stimulated detoxification of BFA is restricted to the small pool that is soluble in the aqueous phase then the total intracellular amount of BFA remains unchanged in the presence of forskolin. The steady-state concentration of the active pool can be decreased by treatment with forskolin if the conjugation of BFA to cysteine is faster than the dissociation of BFA from the membrane pool or the entry of BFA from the medium into the small intracellular soluble pool. In this case, the effect on detoxification of the soluble intracellular pool of BFA could account for the effect of forskolin on BFA-induced disassembly of the Golgi apparatus."
