https://openalex.org/W2020200409,"Timely and accurate biodiversity analysis poses an ongoing challenge for the success of biomonitoring programs. Morphology-based identification of bioindicator taxa is time consuming, and rarely supports species-level resolution especially for immature life stages. Much work has been done in the past decade to develop alternative approaches for biodiversity analysis using DNA sequence-based approaches such as molecular phylogenetics and DNA barcoding. On-going assembly of DNA barcode reference libraries will provide the basis for a DNA-based identification system. The use of recently introduced next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches in biodiversity science has the potential to further extend the application of DNA information for routine biomonitoring applications to an unprecedented scale. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using 454 massively parallel pyrosequencing for species-level analysis of freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate taxa commonly used for biomonitoring. We designed our experiments in order to directly compare morphology-based, Sanger sequencing DNA barcoding, and next-generation environmental barcoding approaches. Our results show the ability of 454 pyrosequencing of mini-barcodes to accurately identify all species with more than 1% abundance in the pooled mixture. Although the approach failed to identify 6 rare species in the mixture, the presence of sequences from 9 species that were not represented by individuals in the mixture provides evidence that DNA based analysis may yet provide a valuable approach in finding rare species in bulk environmental samples. We further demonstrate the application of the environmental barcoding approach by comparing benthic macroinvertebrates from an urban region to those obtained from a conservation area. Although considerable effort will be required to robustly optimize NGS tools to identify species from bulk environmental samples, our results indicate the potential of an environmental barcoding approach for biomonitoring programs."
https://openalex.org/W2066279279,"In mammals, myocardial cell death due to infarction results in scar formation and little regenerative response. In contrast, zebrafish have a high capacity to regenerate the heart after surgical resection of myocardial tissue. However, whether zebrafish can also regenerate lesions caused by cell death has not been tested. Here, we present a simple method for induction of necrotic lesions in the adult zebrafish heart based on cryoinjury. Despite widespread tissue death and loss of cardiomyocytes caused by these lesions, zebrafish display a robust regenerative response, which results in substantial clearing of the necrotic tissue and little scar formation. The cellular mechanisms underlying regeneration appear to be similar to those activated in response to ventricular resection. In particular, the epicardium activates a developmental gene program, proliferates and covers the lesion. Concomitantly, mature uninjured cardiomyocytes become proliferative and invade the lesion. Our injury model will be a useful tool to study the molecular mechanisms of natural heart regeneration in response to necrotic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2133464976,"Molecular subtypes of serous ovarian cancer have been recently described. Using data from independent datasets including over 900 primary tumour samples, we show that deregulation of the Let-7 pathway is specifically associated with the C5 molecular subtype of serous ovarian cancer. DNA copy number and gene expression of HMGA2, alleles of Let-7, LIN28, LIN28B, MYC, MYCN, DICER1, and RNASEN were measured using microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 127 samples using tissue microarrays and anti-HMGA2 antibodies. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation of bacterial artificial chromosomes hybridized to 239 ovarian tumours was used to measure translocation at the LIN28B locus. Short interfering RNA knockdown in ovarian cell lines was used to test the functionality of associations observed. Four molecular subtypes (C1, C2, C4, C5) of high-grade serous ovarian cancers were robustly represented in each dataset and showed similar pattern of patient survival. We found highly specific activation of a pathway involving MYCN, LIN28B, Let-7 and HMGA2 in the C5 molecular subtype defined by MYCN amplification and over-expression, over-expression of MYCN targets including the Let-7 repressor LIN28B, loss of Let-7 expression and HMGA2 amplification and over-expression. DICER1, a known Let-7 target, and RNASEN were over-expressed in C5 tumours. We saw no evidence of translocation at the LIN28B locus in C5 tumours. The reported interaction between LIN28B and Let-7 was recapitulated by siRNA knockdown in ovarian cancer cell lines. Our results associate deregulation of MYCN and downstream targets, including Let-7 and oncofetal genes, with serous ovarian cancer. We define for the first time how elements of an oncogenic pathway, involving multiple genes that contribute to stem cell renewal, is specifically altered in a molecular subtype of serous ovarian cancer. By defining the drivers of a molecular subtype of serous ovarian cancers we provide a novel strategy for targeted therapeutic intervention."

Proteasomal removal of these proteins upon covalent polyubiquitination is highly regulated. Recent reports proposed a role for autophagy in clearance of diffuse ubiquitinated proteins delivered by p62/SQSTM1. Here, we compared the turnover dynamics of endogenous ubiquitinated proteins by proteasomes and autophagy by assessing the effect of their inhibitors. Autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A1, ammonium chloride, and 3-methyladenine failed to increase ubiquitinated protein levels. The proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin raised ubiquitinated protein levels at least 3-fold higher than the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine. These trends were observed in SK-N-SH cells under serum or serum-free conditions and in WT or Atg5−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Notably, chloroquine considerably inhibited proteasomes in SK-N-SH cells and MEFs. In these cells, elevation of p62/SQSTM1 was greater upon proteasome inhibition than with all autophagy inhibitors tested and was reduced in Atg5−/− MEFs. With epoxomicin, soluble p62/SQSTM1 associated with proteasomes and p62/SQSTM1 aggregates contained inactive proteasomes, ubiquitinated proteins, and autophagosomes. Prolonged autophagy inhibition (96 h) failed to elevate ubiquitinated proteins in rat cortical neurons, although epoxomicin did. Moreover, prolonged autophagy inhibition in cortical neurons markedly increased p62/SQSTM1, supporting its degradation mainly by autophagy and not by proteasomes. In conclusion, we clearly demonstrate that pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of autophagy fails to elevate ubiquitinated proteins unless the proteasome is affected. We also provide strong evidence that p62/SQSTM1 associates with proteasomes and that autophagy degrades p62/SQSTM1. Overall, the function of p62/SQSTM1 in the proteasomal pathway and autophagy requires further elucidation.

Overall, the function of p62/SQSTM1 in the proteasomal pathway and autophagy requires further elucidation. Chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by selective loss of neurons in specific regions of the CNS. Despite their heterogeneity, they have similar features, including abnormal deposition of ubiquitinated protein aggregates in inclusion bodies within neurons in the respective affected areas of the CNS (reviewed in Ref. 1Mayer R.J. Drug News Perspect. 2003; 16: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ubiquitinated protein aggregates are thought to result from dysfunction of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (UPP) 2The abbreviations used are: UPPubiquitin/proteasome pathwayCQchloroquineEpxepoxomicinLC3light chain 33-MA3-methyladenineMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastPLAproximity ligation assayRptregulatory particle triple-A ATPaseSucsuccinylAMC7-amino-4-methylcoumarinCMAchaperone-mediated autophagy. or from structural changes in the protein substrates that prevent their degradation by the UPP (reviewed in Ref. 2Ciechanover A. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1178-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Emerging studies also implicate autophagy impairment in the formation of the ubiquitinated protein aggregates. Accordingly, two recent studies described prominent ubiquitin-positive aggregates in neurons of autophagy-deficient (Atg5−/− or Atg7−/−) mice (3Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N. Nature. 2006; 441: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (3162) Google Scholar, 4Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T. Murata S. Iwata J. Tanida I. Ueno T. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Nature. 2006; 441: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2874) Google Scholar). Based on these results and on the finding that there was no apparent alteration in proteasome activity in the brains of autophagy-deficient mice (4Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T. Murata S. Iwata J. Tanida I. Ueno T. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Nature. 2006; 441: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2874) Google Scholar), it was suggested that autophagy acts continuously to dispose of diffuse ubiquitinated proteins in a housekeeping role (3Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N.

Although the UPP and autophagy were thought to work in parallel, recent investigations suggest a functional link between the two proteolytic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 6Koga H. Kaushik S. Cuervo A.M. Ageing Res. Rev. 2011; 10: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The sequestosome 1/p62 (p62/SQSTM1) could play an important role in mediating the link between the two pathways. Because of its ability to interact with polyubiquitin chains, p62/SQSTM1 was suggested to be a receptor that binds and delivers polyubiquitinated proteins to the two proteolytic pathways (7Shin J. Arch. Pharm. Res. 1998; 21: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). p62/SQSTM1 is a protein prone to aggregation and was first isolated in human tissues by Shin and co-workers (8Park I. Chung J. Walsh C.T. Yun Y. Strominger J.L. Shin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 12338-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At its N terminus, p62/SQSTM1 has a Phox-BEM1 domain, which is a protein-protein interaction domain that assumes ubiquitin-like folding and can directly bind to proteasomes and other Phox-BEM1-containing proteins, including itself (9Wooten M.W. Hu X. Babu J.R. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Paine M.G. Wooten M.C. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2006; 2006: 62079Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, p62/SQSTM1 was shown to also interact with LC3, a protein that is an autophagosomal marker (10Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A. Outzen H. Øvervatn A. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24131-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). p62/SQSTM1 binds directly to LC3 via a 22-amino acid sequence, the LC3-interacting region (10Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A. Outzen H. Øvervatn A. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24131-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 11Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Wooten M.W. FEBS. Lett. 2007; 581: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). By binding to polyubiquitinated proteins via its C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain, to proteasomes via its N-terminal Phox-BEM1 domain, and to LC3-II via its LC3-interacting region domain, p62/SQSTM1 could direct polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome or to autophagy, when proteasomes are impaired or overwhelmed (10Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A. Outzen H. Øvervatn A. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24131-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 11Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Wooten M.W. FEBS. Lett. 2007; 581: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). p62/SQSTM1 may thus be a candidate for the missing link between the UPP and autophagy. Here, we compared the dynamics of the turnover of ubiquitinated proteins by proteasomes and autophagy by assessing the effect of pharmacologic inhibitors of each pathway on the accumulation of endogenous ubiquitinated proteins as well as on p62/SQSTM1. We conclusively demonstrate that autophagy impairment does not cause the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. The minimal accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins observed upon chloroquine treatment is due to weak proteasome inhibition by the lysosomotropic agent. Other autophagy inhibitors or genetic impairment of autophagy in Atg5−/− MEFs did not cause the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Furthermore, it is clear that p62/SQSTM1 is associated with proteasomes and is degraded mainly by autophagy. The role of p62/SQSTM1 in both proteolytic pathways, i.e. proteasomes and autophagy, requires further elucidation. The protease inhibitors used are as follows: chloroquine, bafilomycin A1, 3-methyladenine, and ammonium chloride (Sigma); epoxomicin (Peptides International Inc., Louisville, KY). The substrates used are as follows: Suc-LLVY-AMC (Bachem Bioscience Inc., King of Prussia, PA). The primary antibodies used are as follows: rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitinated proteins (1:1500, catalog no. Z0458, Dako North America, Carpinteria, CA); mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (for immunofluorescence detects mono- and polyubiquitinated proteins, 1:500, catalog no. BML-PW8810), anti-α4 (1:500, catalog no. PW8120), anti-Rpt6/S8 (1:1000, catalog no. PW9265), rabbit polyclonal anti-β5 (1:1000, catalog no. PW8895), in vitro synthesized Lys63-only and Lys48-only polyubiquitinated substrates (all from Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY); mouse monoclonal anti-B-actin (1:10,000, catalog no. A-2228) and rabbit polyclonal anti-B-actin (1:10,000, catalog no. A-2066) both from Sigma; rabbit polyclonal anti-p62/SQSTM1 (1:1000, catalog no. PM045) and anti-Atg5 (1:1000, catalog no. PM050), and mouse monoclonal anti-Atg16 (1:1000, catalog no. M150–3) from MBL International Corp. (Woburn, MA). For the glycerol gradient fractionation the following were used: mouse monoclonal p62/SQSTM1 (Lck ligand) (1:500, catalog no. 610833, BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA); rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3 (1:1000, catalog no. Nb 100-2220, Novus Biological, Littleton, CO); secondary antibodies with HRP conjugate (1:10,000, Bio-Rad); and for immunofluorescence, Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit (1:500, catalog no. A11029 and A11036, respectively, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). Human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells were derived from peripheral tissue (12Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar) and were obtained from ATCC. Under serum conditions, the cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in minimal essential media with Eagle's salts containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.4% minimal essential media vitamins, 0.4% minimal essential media nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% normal fetal bovine serum. Under serum-free conditions, the cells were maintained as in serum conditions except that the media lacked nonessential amino acids and fetal bovine serum. Wild type and Atg5−/− mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines (MEFs) were obtained from RIKEN BRC (Japan) and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% normal fetal bovine serum as described previously (13Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). The Atg5−/− cell line is deficient in Atg5, which is essential for autophagosome formation. Wild type and Atg5−/− MEFs were prepared from 13.5-day-old embryos and transformed with pEF321-T, an SV40 large T antigen expression vector to generate immortalized cell lines (13Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Rat cerebral cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from E18 embryos obtained from pregnant Sprague-Dawley females following the methods described previously (14Biederer T. Scheiffele P. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in neurobasal media supplemented with B27 and 0.5 mm l-GlutaMAX. Cells were plated on 100-mm dishes precoated with 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine and at a density of 6 million cells per dish. Experiments were carried out following 8 days in culture. Cells were treated at 37 °C for different times with vehicle (0.5% DMSO) or different concentrations of the protease inhibitors listed above. Drugs were added dropwise directly into the medium with a gentle swirl of the culture plate. At the end of the incubation, all cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and processed for the different assays as described below. Cell washes removed unattached cells; therefore, subsequent assays were performed on adherent cells only. Cell survival was assessed with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described previously (15Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and harvested by gently scraping into hot (100 °C) SDS buffer (0.01 m Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5, and 1% SDS) to make sure all intracellular proteins were included. Samples were subjected to a 5-min boil at 100 °C followed by a brief sonication. After determination of the protein concentration with the bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce), the following was added to each sample: β-mercaptoethanol (358 mm), bromphenol blue (0.005%), glycerol (20%), and SDS (4%) in stacking gel buffer (0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8). Following SDS-PAGE on 8 or 10% polyacrylamide gels, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were probed with the respective antibodies, and antigens were visualized by a standard chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase method with the ECL reagent. Semi-quantification of protein detection was done by image analysis with the ImageJ program (National Institutes of Health, //rsb.info.nih.gov). Relative intensity (no units) is the ratio between the value for each protein and the value for the respective loading control. Total cell lysates were prepared on ice by homogenization in 0.01 m Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5, buffer. The lysates were cleared by a 15-min centrifugation (19,000 × g) at 4 °C. The cleared samples were normalized for protein concentration determined with the bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce). The chymotrypsin-like activity was assayed colorimetrically in 25 μg of protein/sample with the substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC (400 μm in DMSO) after 24-h incubations at 37 °C as described previously (16Wilk S. Orlowski M. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Values obtained were in the linear range of the reaction (data not shown). Cells were harvested in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT. Following homogenization and sonication, the lysates were centrifuged (19,000 × g for 15 min) at 4 °C. The cleared supernatants (2 mg of protein/sample) were subjected to centrifugation (83,000 × g for 24 h) at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor in a 10–40% glycerol gradient (fractions 13 to 1) made in the same lysis buffer. Following centrifugation, 13 fractions (800 μl each) were collected and analyzed. Aliquots (50 μl) of each fraction were assayed for chymotrypsin-like activity with the substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC colorimetrically after 24-h incubations at 37 °C as described previously (16Wilk S. Orlowski M. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated with acetone from 700 μl of each fraction and subjected to Western blot analysis (10% gels). The membranes were probed with the respective antibodies, and antigens were visualized by a standard chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase method with the ECL reagent. Upon treatment with vehicle (DMSO) or the respective drugs, cells were washed twice with PBS and were harvested with the following buffer A: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP (grade 1; Sigma), 1 mm DTT and 10% glycerol, which preserves 26 S proteasome assembly (17Elsasser S. Schmidt M. Finley D. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Following homogenization and centrifugation (19,000 × g for 15-min) at 4 °C, the protein concentration of the cleared supernatants was determined with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and normalized with buffer A. The cleared supernatants (80 μg of protein/lane for proteasome activity and 40 μg of protein/lane for Western blotting) were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE using a modification of the method described previously (18Ogburn K.D. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23274-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We used a gel consisting of three layers of equal amounts, from the bottom up, of 5, 4, and 3% polyacrylamide with RhinohideTM polyacrylamide strengthener (Molecular Probes). Bromphenol blue was added to the protein samples prior to loading. Nondenaturing minigels were run at 150 V for either 3 h or 90 min. The gels were then incubated on a rocker for 10 min at 37 °C with 15 ml of 400 μm Suc-LLVY-AMC in buffer B (buffer A modified to contain 1 mm ATP). Proteasome bands were visualized upon exposure to UV light (360 nm) and were photographed with a NIKON Cool Pix 8700 camera with a 3-4219 fluorescent green filter (Peca Products, Inc.). Proteins on the native gels were transferred (110 mA) for 2 h onto PVDF membranes. Western blot analyses were then carried out sequentially for detection of the 20 S and 26 S proteasomes with anti-β5 and anti-Rpt6/S8 subunit antibodies. The anti-β5 antibody reacts with a core particle subunit and therefore detects both the 26 S and 20 S proteasomes. The anti-Rpt6/S8 antibody reacts with a regulatory particle subunit, thus only detecting 26 S proteasomes. Antigens were visualized by a chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase method with the ECL reagent. Aliquots of the samples were also boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer and loaded onto 10% gels (40 μg of protein/lane) for Western blot analysis following SDS-PAGE. Cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested with RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture). Following homogenization, lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C (for 15 min at 19,000 × g). Cell pellets were resuspended by sonication in harvesting buffer containing 2% SDS; 100 μg of protein/sample were trapped by filtration through a pre-wet Trans-Blot nitrocellulose membrane 0.2 μm adapted to a 96-well dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) as described previously (19Wanker E.E. Scherzinger E. Heiser V. Sittler A. Eickhoff H. Lehrach H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Because of the 0.2-μm pore size of this membrane, only aggregated proteins are retained, although the soluble ones pass through the pores of the membrane. To detect aggregates, the membranes were probed with the anti-p62/SQSTM1 or the anti-ubiquitinated protein antibodies. After treatment, SK-N-SH cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The PLA was performed as described previously (20Söderberg O. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Ridderstråle K. Leuchowius K.J. Jarvius J. Wester K. Hydbring P. Bahram F. Larsson L.G. Landegren U. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar) and with the Duolink PLA detection kit 613 from Axxora, LLC, San Diego. Slides were mounted with Vectashield medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cell staining was visualized with an UltraViewVoX spinning disk confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After treatment, SK-N-SH cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and post-fixed for 2 min in ice-cold methanol, followed by blocking and permeabilization in 2.5% BSA, 5% normal goat serum, and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h, and co-incubated overnight at 4 °C with the respective antibodies. Slides were mounted with ProLong® Gold antifade mounting reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Cell staining was visualized with an Axio Imager M2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging, Inc. Thornwood, NY). statistical significance was estimated using one-way analysis of variance (Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test) with the Instat 2.0, Graphpad software (San Diego). To investigate the link between autophagy and degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, SK-N-SH cells were treated with three different autophagy inhibitors, namely chloroquine (CQ, 100 μm), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 10 mm), and bafilomycin A1 (200 nm) at concentrations reported in the literature to inhibit autophagy. We compared the effects of the three drugs on cell viability and autophagy inhibition. In parallel studies, we treated cells with epoxomicin (Epx, 25 nm), an irreversible proteasome inhibitor. Fig. 1A shows that at the concentrations tested bafilomycin A1 was the most toxic of the drugs tested. Autophagy inhibition was assessed by accumulation of the autophagosome marker LC3-II, which is accepted as an overall indicator of autophagy impairment. LC3-II levels were most prominent after chloroquine treatment (123-fold increase) as indicated by the strong LC3-II band on the Western blots (Fig. 1B). In bafilomycin A1-treated cells, LC3-II levels (32-fold increase) were lower than in chloroquine-treated cells, and ammonium chloride and epoxomicin treatment failed to induce LC3-II accumulation (Fig. 1B). These data show that among the three autophagy inhibitors tested, chloroquine most effectively raised LC3-II levels. Proteasome inhibition by epoxomicin had no inhibitory effect on autophagy. p62/SQSTM1 was suggested to be specifically degraded by autophagy (10Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A.

Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar). We compared how the four proteolytic inhibitors listed above affected p62/SQSTM1 as well as ubiquitinated protein levels. It is clear that from the four drugs tested, epoxomicin most effectively increased p62/SQSTM1 (9-fold, Fig. 1C) and ubiquitinated protein (3-fold, Fig. 1D) levels in SK-N-SH cells. Chloroquine caused a detectable increase in p62/SQSTM1 (6-fold), albeit to a lesser extent than epoxomicin. Ammonium chloride and bafilomycin A did not increase p62/SQSTM1 levels. Another autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, failed to increase the levels of ubiquitinated proteins, p62/SQSTM1 and LC3-II (supplemental Fig. 1). Upon treatment with chloroquine, we observed a 1.7-fold increase in ubiquitinated proteins. Actin levels were not increased by any of the treatments (Fig. 1E). To further investigate the cross-talk between the UPP and autophagy, we decided to focus our studies on chloroquine and epoxomicin, because ammonium chloride and bafilomycin A1 failed to increase p62/SQSTM1 and ubiquitinated protein levels, and the latter inhibitor was highly cytotoxic. We compared the effects of inhibiting each pathway alone with inhibiting both pathways together (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in cells maintained under serum or serum-free conditions (the latter not shown). p62/SQSTM1 levels were raised 4-fold over control by epoxomicin (p < 0.01) but only 2-fold by chloroquine (p > 0.05, not significant) (Fig. 2, A and D). In cells treated with both inhibitors, p62/SQSTM1 levels were higher than in cells treated with epoxomicin alone, but the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). As expected, LC3-II levels were increased only in cells treated with chloroquine as proteasome inhibition does not block autophagy function. Chloroquine alone raised LC3-II levels 2-fold (p < 0.01, Fig. 2, B and D). LC3-II levels were similar in cells treated with chloroquine alone or in combination with epoxomicin (p > 0.05). The levels of LC3-I and the α4 subunit of the 20 S proteasome did not show any significant changes (Fig. 2, B–D). Together, these data clearly demonstrate that proteasome inhibition most efficiently increases p62/SQSTM1 levels when compared with autophagy impairment, the latter ascertained by accumulation of LC3-II in cells treated with chloroquine. Inhibition of lysosomal function was recently shown to reduce proteasome activity (23Qiao L. Zhang J. Neurosci. Lett. 2009; 456: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and therefore, we compared the effect of epoxomicin and chloroquine on the cleavage of Suc-LLVY-AMC, a short substrate used to measure proteasome activity. Similar results were obtained under serum and serum-free conditions (the latter not shown). As shown in Fig. 2G, Suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolysis measured in total lysates was blocked by at least 80% in cells treated with epoxomicin or chloroquine alone or combined. Despite a similar decline in Suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolysis observed in cells treated with each or both drugs, the levels of ubiquitinated proteins were quite different. Treatment with epoxomicin caused an ∼3-fold rise in ubiquitinated protein levels (p < 0.01) compared with a much smaller increase (1.8-fold, p > 0.05) in cells treated with chloroquine (Fig. 2, E and F). Combined treatment with epoxomicin and chloroquine enhanced ubiquitinated protein levels by 4-fold, which was significantly different from the values observed under epoxomicin alone (p < 0.01, Fig. 2, E and F). Ubiquitin protein aggregates were detected with the filter trap assay in cells treated with epoxomicin by itself or in combination with chloroquine (Fig. 2H). Actin levels were not changed upon proteasome and/or autophagy inhibition (Fig. 2E). These data clearly demonstrate that measuring Suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolysis using total cell lysates does not accurately reflect proteasome activity. This is not surprising, because it is well established that the substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC is cleaved not only by the proteasome (24Stein R.L. Melandri F. Dick L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3899-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) but also by other chymotrypsin-like proteases as well as by calpains (25Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Yumoto N. Yoshimura N. Murachi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12489-12494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it is clear that the overall levels of ubiquitinated proteins in chloroquine-treated cells are very low. This includes Lys48- and Lys63-linked chains as both are detected with the polyubiquitin antibody from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA) used in these studies (Fig. 2E, left panel). This is relevant to autophagy because Lys63-linked chains were postulated to selectively facilitate the clearance of ubiquitinated proteins via the autophagic pathway (26Tan J.M. Wong E.S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Pletnikova O. Ko H.S. Tay S.P. Ho M.W. Troncoso J. Gygi S.P. Lee M.K. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Lim K.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar).

To understand their biosynthetic origins as well as produce increased supplies and analog molecules, access to the clustered biosynthetic genes that encode for the assembly enzymes is necessary. Complicating these efforts is the universal presence of heterotrophic bacteria in the cell wall and sheath material of cyanobacteria obtained from the environment and those grown in uni-cyanobacterial culture. Moreover, the high similarity in genetic elements across disparate secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways renders imprecise current gene cluster targeting strategies and contributes sequence complexity resulting in partial genome coverage. Thus, it was necessary to use a dual-method approach of single-cell genomic sequencing based on multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and metagenomic library screening. Here, we report the identification of the putative apratoxin. A biosynthetic gene cluster, a potent cancer cell cytotoxin with promise for medicinal applications. The roughly 58 kb biosynthetic gene cluster is composed of 12 open reading frames and has a type I modular mixed polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) organization and features loading and off-loading domain architecture never previously described. Moreover, this work represents the first successful isolation of a complete biosynthetic gene cluster from Lyngbya bouillonii, a tropical marine cyanobacterium renowned for its production of diverse bioactive secondary metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2137878762,"Wind energy offers the potential to reduce carbon emissions while increasing energy independence and bolstering economic development. However, wind energy has a larger land footprint per Gigawatt (GW) than most other forms of energy production, making appropriate siting and mitigation particularly important. Species that require large unfragmented habitats and those known to avoid vertical structures are particularly at risk from wind development. Developing energy on disturbed lands rather than placing new developments within large and intact habitats would reduce cumulative impacts to wildlife. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that it will take 241 GW of terrestrial based wind development on approximately 5 million hectares to reach 20% electricity production for the U.S. by 2030. We estimate there are ∼7,700 GW of potential wind energy available across the U.S., with ∼3,500 GW on disturbed lands. In addition, a disturbance-focused development strategy would avert the development of ∼2.3 million hectares of undisturbed lands while generating the same amount of energy as development based solely on maximizing wind potential. Wind subsidies targeted at favoring low-impact developments and creating avoidance and mitigation requirements that raise the costs for projects impacting sensitive lands could improve public value for both wind energy and biodiversity conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2009947577,"Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) regulate the expression of a number of enzymes, which catalyze the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids. SREBP1c is the most relevant isoform in the adult liver, and its expression is controlled by the nutritional state. Transcriptional regulation studies into the SREBP1c gene, performed in the last few years, have improved our knowledge of the variability of signals that converge on its promoter region. Insulin, cholesterol derivatives, T3 and other endogenous molecules have been demonstrated to regulate the SREBP1c expression, particularly in rodents. The present study aimed to perform a detailed analysis of the human SREBP1c gene promoter structure in liver cells by focusing on responses to diverse metabolic signals. Serial deletion and mutation assays reveal that both SREBP (SRE) and LXR (LXRE) response elements are involved in SREBP1c transcription regulation mediated by insulin and cholesterol derivatives. We discovered that peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonists enhance the activity of the SREBP1c promoter; a DR1 element, at -453 in the human promoter was involved in this activation. Moreover, PPARα agonists act in cooperation with LXR or insulin to induce lipogenesis. Collectively, our results identify PPARα as a novel regulatory factor in SREBP1c regulation which plays a relevant role in the interplay between lipids and insulin metabolic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2118148334,"Scleractinian corals are the most basal eumetazoan taxon and provide the biological and physical framework for coral reefs, which are among the most diverse of all ecosystems. Over the past three decades and coincident with climate change, these phototrophic symbiotic organisms have been subject to increasingly frequent and severe diseases, which are now geographically widespread and a major threat to these ecosystems. Although coral immunity has been the subject of increasing study, the available information remains fragmentary, especially with respect to coral antimicrobial responses. In this study, we characterized damicornin from Pocillopora damicornis, the first scleractinian antimicrobial peptide (AMP) to be reported. We found that its precursor has a segmented organization comprising a signal peptide, an acidic proregion, and the C-terminal AMP. The 40-residue AMP is cationic, C-terminally amidated, and characterized by the presence of six cysteine molecules joined by three intramolecular disulfide bridges. Its cysteine array is common to another AMP and toxins from cnidarians; this suggests a common ancestor, as has been proposed for AMPs and toxins from arthropods. Damicornin was active in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria and the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Damicornin expression was studied using a combination of immunohistochemistry, reverse phase HPLC, and quantitative RT-PCR. Our data show that damicornin is constitutively transcribed in ectodermal granular cells, where it is stored, and further released in response to nonpathogenic immune challenge.

Lafferty K.D. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E120Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), coral reefs are endangered. The reasons for this alarming status are multiple and include increasing water temperature, which disrupts symbiosis and leads to coral bleaching, and anthropogenic pressures such as overfishing that lead to ecosystem disequilibrium. Among impacts on coral reefs, the incidence of coral disease appears to be increasing in frequency and severity (1Bourne D.G. Garren M. Work T.M. Rosenberg E. Smith G.W. Harvell C.D. Trends Microbiol. 2009; 17: 554-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 7Weil E. Smith G. Gil-Agudelo D.L. Dis. Aquat. Org. 2006; 69: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This phenomenon appears to be aggravated by global warming, and it has been suggested that high temperatures influence the outcome of bacterial infections by lowering the resistance of the coral to disease and/or increasing pathogen growth, infectivity, or virulence (8Rodriguez-Lanetty M. Harii S. Hoegh-Guldberg O. Mol. Ecol. 2009; 18: 5101-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Ward J.R Kim K. Harvell C.D Mar. Ecol.-Prog. Ser. 2007; 329: 115-121Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Increased virulence has been demonstrated in the bacterium Vibrio coralliilyticus, where it leads to bleaching and tissue lysis in Pocillopora damicornis (10Ben-Haim Y. Thompson F.L. Thompson C.C.

Ben Haim H. Loya Y. Mar. Ecol.-Prog. Ser. 1998; 171: 131-137Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It has been shown that an increase in temperature triggers bacteria adhesion and toxin and enzyme production (12Ben-Haim Rozenblat Y. Rosenberg E. Rosenberg E. Loya Y. Coral Health and Disease.

Although the central role of Vibrio species in several coral diseases has been widely documented, knowledge of the effects of Vibrio infection on coral physiology/immunity is rudimentary. One reason is the paucity of information on coral immunology, particularly with respect to defenses against infectious agents (1Bourne D.G. Garren M. Work T.M. Rosenberg E. Smith G.W. Harvell C.D.

As for all invertebrates, coral immunity is thought to rely on innate mechanisms involving pattern recognition receptors and cellular and humoral responses directed against infectious agents (14Mydlarz L.D.

However, several recent studies have suggested the involvement of antibacterial agents. Thus, the mucus of several species of scleractinians has been shown to have antibacterial properties (23Geffen Y. Ron E.Z. Rosenberg E. FEMS Microbiol.

We describe here the isolation and characterization of damicornin, the first AMP reported from a scleractinian coral. We report the structure of the damicornin precursor, its localization in coral tissues, its antimicrobial spectrum against a panel of microorganisms including its specific pathogenic bacterium V. coralliilyticus, and its expression in corals confronted with virulent and avirulent bacteria. Our results show that: (i) damicornin has a cysteine array common to other cnidarian AMPs and toxins; (ii) damicornin is expressed and released from coral ectodermal cells exposed to a nonpathogenic stimulus; and (iii) the gene for expression of damicornin is repressed concomitantly with the invasion of host ectodermal cells by the coral pathogen V. coralliilyticus. The P. damicornis (Linnaeus, 1758) isolate used in this study was collected from Lombock, Indonesia (CITES number 06832/VI/SATS/LN/2001), propagated, and maintained in aquaria, as described previously (22Vidal-Dupiol J. Adjeroud M. Roger E. Foure L. Duval D. Mone Y. Ferrier-Pages C. Tambutte E. Tambutte S. Zoccola D. Allemand D. Mitta G. BMC Physiol. 2009; 9: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The filamentous fungus Fusarium oxysporum and strains of the Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus (A270), Bacillus megaterium (IBMC), Staphylococcus aureus (SG511), Brevibacterium stationis (CIP 101282), and Microbacterium maritypicum (CIP 105733T) and the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (SBS 363), Vibrio aesturianus (CIP 109791), and Vibrio splendidus (CIP 107715) were the same as used in a previous study (28Schmitt P. Wilmes M. Pugnière M. Aumelas A. Bachère E. Sahl H.G. Schneider T. Destoumieux-Garzón D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). V. shiloi (CIP 107136) and V. coralliilyticus strain YB1 (CIP 107925) were obtained from the Pasteur Institute (Collection de l'Institut Pasteur). V. coralliilyticus was used in biotic stress and infection experiments with P. damicornis (29Ben-Haim Y. Rosenberg E. Mar. Biol. 2002; 141: 47-55Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For routine use V. coralliilyticus was cultured in 2216 Marine Broth medium (BD-DIFCO 279110) at 30 °C under aerobic conditions with shaking (150 rpm). During experimental procedures (see below), it was used at the ambient coral maintenance temperature. Experiments to determine which cells (host or symbiont) expressed the candidate genes involved the use of three zooxanthellae isolates; the origin of and culture conditions for the zooxanthellae have been reported elsewhere (22Vidal-Dupiol J. Adjeroud M. Roger E. Foure L. Duval D. Mone Y. Ferrier-Pages C. Tambutte E. Tambutte S. Zoccola D. Allemand D. Mitta G. BMC Physiol. 2009; 9: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The experiments were designed to investigate coral responses to bacterial challenge (bacterial stress and bacterial infection). Bacterial stress was induced by the addition of V. coralliilyticus at 25 °C, whereas bacterial infection was induced by the addition of V. coralliilyticus under conditions of increasing water temperature (from 25 to 32.5 °C), which activated bacterial virulence. We recently reported that the bacterium becomes virulent at a temperature of 28 °C (27Vidal-Dupiol J. Ladrière O. Meistertzheim A.L. Fouré L. Adjeroud M. Mitta G. J. Exp. Biol. 2011; 214: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Bacterial stress and infection treatments and appropriate controls were established in four separate 120-liter tanks as follows: (i) V. coralliilyticus added at a constant temperature of 25 °C (Cb); (ii) V. coralliilyticus added with a gradual temperature increase from 25 to 32.5 °C (Tb); (iii) a constant temperature of 25 °C without bacteria added (C); and (iv) a gradual temperature increase from 25 to 32.5 °C in the absence of added bacteria (T). Nubbins of P. damicornis (fixed piece of coral of ∼10 g) were randomly placed in each experimental tank (n = 40/tank) and acclimatized at 25 °C for 2 weeks. Bacteria were added to the Cb and Tb treatment tanks every 3 days by balneation (12Ben-Haim Rozenblat Y. Rosenberg E. Rosenberg E. Loya Y. Coral Health and Disease. Spinger-Verlag, New York2004: 301-324Google Scholar). Briefly, this involved washing the bacteria twice in filtered sea water (0.22 μm) and adding the washed cells to the tank to achieve a concentration of 103 cells/ml of tank water. Water circulation ensured the homogenous distribution of bacteria in the tank. The cultures of V. coralliilyticus were grown at 25 °C for the Cb treatment and at the temperature corresponding to that of the tank for Tb. For the Tb treatment and the T control, the temperature was increased by 1.5 °C every 3 days, beginning on day 3 (D3), until it reached 32.5 °C. Three P. damicornis nubbins were randomly sampled from each tank every 3 days (D0, D3, D9, D12, D15, and D18). The tank temperature was controlled using an aquarium heater (600 W, Schego) connected to an electronic thermostat (Hobby Biotherm Professional). Illumination was supplied at an irradiance of 250 μmol photon/m2/s (measured using a quantum meter; QMSW-SS, Apogee Instruments Inc.) using metal halide lamps (Iwasaki 6500 Kelvin, 400 W) set to a 12-h light:12-h dark photoperiod. All other seawater parameters were held constant over time in the tanks. A water pump (IDRA, 1300 liters/h) continuously recycled the tank seawater at a rate of 10.8 tank volumes/h, passing it through a biological filter and an Aquavie protein skimmer (EPS 600). A proportion of the tank water (2%) was replaced each day with natural filtered Mediterranean seawater heated to 25 °C. To avoid the growth of bacterial blooms, the water was continuously treated using a UVC filter (JBL, AquaCristal Series II, 5 W). At each time of addition of V. coralliilyticus, all of the equipment known to remove or kill bacteria (the protein skimmer and the UVC filter) was inactivated for 4 h to allow the bacteria to adhere to the coral tissues. RACE-PCR experiments were performed to characterize the complete ORF of the putative AMP. Tissue extraction, total RNA extraction, poly(A)+ purification, and RACE-PCR were conducted using nonchallenged P. damicornis nubbin, as described previously (22Vidal-Dupiol J. Adjeroud M. Roger E. Foure L. Duval D. Mone Y. Ferrier-Pages C. Tambutte E. Tambutte S. Zoccola D. Allemand D. Mitta G. BMC Physiol. 2009; 9: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR (q-RT-PCR) was used to analyze the expression profile of the putative AMP. Total RNA was extracted, and 2.5 μg was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and the Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA products were purified using a Nucleotrap gel extraction trial kit (Clontech), and q-RT-PCR was performed using 2.5 μl of purified cDNA (diluted 1:50 in water) in a total volume of 10 μl containing 1× LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche Applied Science) and 70 nm of each primer. The primers, which were designed using the Light Cycler Probe Design Software, version 1.0 (Roche Applied Science), are shown in Table 1. Amplification was performed using a LightCycler 480 system (Roche Applied Science) and the following reaction conditions: activation of the Thermo-Start® DNA polymerase at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Melting curve profiles were assayed to ensure that a single product was amplified. Each run included a positive cDNA control that was sampled at the beginning of the experiment (D0) and also from each amplification plate; this positive control was also used as the calibrator sample, and blank controls (water) were included for each primer pair. The PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis, the bands were isolated directly from agarose gels, and DNA was extracted using the gel extraction PCR purification system V (Promega). The resulting q-RT-PCR products were single-pass sequenced as described above.TABLE 1Primers used for q-RT-PCRGene nameForward primer (5′ → 3′)Reverse primer (5′ → 3′)PreprodamicorninAGTCCCAGAAAAGCGGGTGGGTAACATCGCGTMajor basic nuclear proteinGGTACAGCAAACTGCGTTGGAAACGTCCGACC60 S ribosomal protein L22TGATGTGTCCATTGATCGTCCATAAGTAGTTTGTGCAGAGG60 S ribosomal protein L40ACGACTGAGAGGAGGAGCCTCATTTGGACATTCCCGT60 S acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0GCTACTGTTGGGTAGCCCTCTCCATTCTCGTATGGT Open table in a new tab For each reaction, the crossing point (Cp) was determined using the second derivative max method applied by the LightCycler Software, version 3.3 (Roche Applied Science). The PCR efficiency (E) of each primer pair was calculated by determining the slope of standard curves obtained from serial dilution analysis of the cDNAs pooled from all experimental samples, as described previously (30Yuan J.S. Reed A. Chen F. Stewart Jr., C.N. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). The individual q-RT-PCR efficiencies for the target or reference genes were calculated using the formula: E = 10(−1/slope). The transcription level of the putative AMP was normalized using the mean geometric transcription rate of three reference genes encoding ribosomal proteins, obtained from P. damicornis: 60 S ribosomal protein L22, 60 S ribosomal protein L40A, and 60 S acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (GenBank™ accession numbers HO112261, HO112283, and HO112666, respectively). The stable expression status of these three genes under nonstress, thermal stress, bacterial stress, and bacterial infection conditions was recently demonstrated (27Vidal-Dupiol J. Ladrière O. Meistertzheim A.L. Fouré L. Adjeroud M. Mitta G. J. Exp. Biol. 2011; 214: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The normalized relative quantities (NRQ) were calculated as described previously (31Hellemans J. Mortier G. De Paepe A. Speleman F. Vandesompele J. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R19Crossref PubMed Scopus (3033) Google Scholar), using the equation,NRQ=EtargetΔCp,target3∏i=13ErefiΔCp,refiEq. 1 where Etarget is the amplification efficiency of the gene of interest; Eref is the amplification efficiency of the reference gene; ΔCp, ref = Cp, ref(calibrator) − Cp, ref(sample); and ΔCp, target = Cp, target(calibrator) − Cp, target(sample). To determine which organism (host or symbiont) expressed the putative AMP gene, cross-PCR experiments were performed on DNA and RNA extracted from the holobiont (host plus symbiont) and from pure cultured zooxanthellae, as described previously (22Vidal-Dupiol J. Adjeroud M. Roger E. Foure L. Duval D. Mone Y. Ferrier-Pages C. Tambutte E. Tambutte S. Zoccola D. Allemand D. Mitta G. BMC Physiol. 2009; 9: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR amplifications were performed with oligonucleotides amplifying the AMP, housekeeping genes, the gene encoding the small ribosomal subunit RNA of Symbiodinium spp. (32Rowan R. Powers D.A. Mar. Ecol.-Prog. Ser. 1991; 71: 65-73Crossref Google Scholar), and the cDNA encoding the major basic nuclear protein (GenBank™ accession number HO112459) of Symbiodinium spp. (Table 1). The putative peptide (ACADLRGKTFCRLFKSYCDKKGIRGRLMRDKCSYSCGCR-NH2) was chemically synthesized (5 mg; Genepep, Saint-Clément de Rivière, France) in a C-terminally amidated form, and the folding of the three disulfide bonds was performed. The HPLC purity of the peptide was 96%. The synthetic peptide was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the putative AMP and to immunize New Zealand rabbits, as described previously (33Vaitukaitis J. Robbins J.B. Nieschlag E. Ross G.T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1971; 33: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Serum from nonimmunized and immunized rabbits was collected 70 days after initial injection and tested for the presence of specific Igs (antibody or IgG) using ELISA (34Hancock C.D. Evans G.I. Manson M. Methods in Molecular Biology: Immunochemical Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 33-41Google Scholar) with uncoupled synthetic peptide adsorbed onto MaxiSorp™ plates (Nunc). The IgG fraction was purified using affinity chromatography (35Porath J. Olin B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1621-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), and antibody specificity was tested by Western blot. Briefly, coral proteins and the synthetic peptide were subjected to Tris-Tricine (16.5%) gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. To verify the specificity, the blots were probed with preimmune and purified immune sera at a dilution of 1:1000. The remainder of the procedure was performed as described previously (36Zoccola D. Tambutté E. Kulhanek E. Puverel S. Scimeca J.C. Allemand D. Tambutté S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1663: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Tissues of P. damicornis from unstressed coral colonies or from coral colonies stressed with nonvirulent bacteria were processed following a procedure described elsewhere (37Puverel S. Tambutte E. Zoccola D. Domart-Coulon I. Bouchot A. Lotto S. Allemand D. Tambutte S. Coral Reefs. 2005; 24: 149-156Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thin sections (7 μm) of tissues embedded in Paraplast were cut, mounted on silane-coated glass slides, and stored at 4 °C in a dry atmosphere. The paraffin was removed from the sections, which were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a saturating medium containing 2% BSA, 0.2% teleostean gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.5% donkey serum in 0.05 mol/liter PBS at pH 7.4. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a moist chamber with the purified antibodies raised against synthetic damicornin (85 μg/ml in saturating medium) or with the depleted purified antibodies raised against synthetic damicornin (depletion was performed by preincubating the purified antibodies for 1 h at room temperature with the synthetic damicornin). Excess antibodies were removed by repeated rinsing, and the sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibodies (secondary antibodies; Amersham Biosciences RPN1004) diluted 1:250 in the saturating medium. After incubation, the sections were rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4) and stained for 15 min with streptavidin AlexaFluor 568 (S11226; Molecular Probes) diluted 1:50 in PBS and DAPI (D9542; Sigma; 2 μg/ml). The sections were mounted in Pro-Long antifade medium (P7481; Molecular Probes) and observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (TCSSP5; Leica). To detect the native antimicrobial peptide in coral tissues, nine coral nubbins (sampled from the Cb and C tanks) were harvested, and the tissue was extracted using a water pick (800 ml of 0.2-μm filtered seawater refrigerated at 4 °C). The extracts were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The extract supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of 2 m acetic acid and homogenized (15 strokes) using a Dounce homogenizer (100 μm). The homogenate was placed in a 4 °C water bath and sonicated (Vibra-cell™ 75185, medium power, three pulses of 30 s), then stirred over night at 4 °C, and finally centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove cellular fragments. The supernatant was immediately collected and prefractionated using a Sep-Pak C18 Vac cartridge (Sep-Pac Vac 12cc; Waters Corporation). Briefly, the Sep-Pak column was washed using acidified water with TFA (0.05%), and three successive elutions were performed with 10, 60, and 80% acetonitrile in acidified water. The fractions obtained were lyophilized and reconstituted with 1 ml of acidified water (0.05% TFA). The reconstituted extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at maximum speed and 4 °C and tested for antimicrobial activity as described below. All of the HPLC purification steps were performed using a Waters Breeze system (Waters 1525, binary HPLC pump) equipped with a UV detector (Waters 2487, dual λ absorbance detector). The column effluent was monitored by UV absorption at 224 and 280 nm. Fractions were hand-collected and tested for antimicrobial activity. Aliquots (150 μl) of Sep-Pak fractions with antimicrobial activity were subjected to reverse phase HPLC using a Symmetry C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm; Waters). Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 15–85% acetonitrile in acidified water over 70 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions corresponding to absorbance peaks were collected in polypropylene tubes, freeze dried, reconstituted in 0.1 ml of acidified ultrapure water, and tested for antimicrobial activity as described below. The active fraction was again subjected to reverse phase HPLC using a Symmetry C8 column (150 mm × 2.1 mm; Waters). Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 45–55% acetonitrile in acidified water over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions corresponding to absorbance peaks were collected in polypropylene tubes, freeze dried, reconstituted in 0.03 ml of acidified ultrapure water, and tested for antimicrobial activity or submitted to MS analysis. The dried active fraction or 20 μg of synthetic peptide was resuspended in 10 μl of pure water (ultra liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry solvent; Biosolve). MALDI-TOF mass measurements were carried out using an Ultraflex™ TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany) at a maximum accelerating potential of 25 kV in positive mode and in either linear or reflectron mode. Each sample (1 μl) was co-crystallized on stainless steel MALDI targets with 1 μl of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml of acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% TFA, 7:3 v/v) using the dried droplet method of matrix crystallization. External calibration of the MALDI mass spectra was carried out using singly charged monoisotopic peaks (Pepmix calibration standard; Bruker Daltonics, Wissembourg, France). The same molecules were also treated by tryptic digestion prior to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The tryptic digestion was conducted directly on stainless steel MALDI targets. A 1-μl sample was first reduced in 1 μl of a 2× DTT solution (20 mm in NH4HCOO3, 50 mm) for 30 min at 55 °C in a moist chamber. Secondly, alkylation was performed in the dark at room temperature in a moist chamber by adding 1 μl of a 2× iodoacetamide solution (110 mm, in NH4HCOO3, 50 mm) and incubating for 30 min. The protein samples were then digested by the addition of 2 μl of a trypsin (sequence grade; Promega, Charbonniere, France) solution (40 μg/ml, reconstituted just prior to use in 50 mm NH4HCOO3) and incubation overnight at 37 °C in a moist chamber. For MALDI-MS analysis, 1 μl of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid was spotted onto the digest and dried. The experiments to establish the positions of the disulfide bonds in the putative AMP were performed using a MALDI LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with automatic gain control turned on. The signal was optimized by adjusting the laser energy to 6–8 μJ. The default target values were used in all experiments. Both MS and MS/MS experiments were acquired in centroi"
https://openalex.org/W2030157657,"Background In the progression of acne vulgaris, the disruption of follicular epithelia by an over-growth of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) permits the bacteria to spread and become in contact with various skin and immune cells. Methodology/Principal Findings We have demonstrated in the present study that the Christie, Atkins, Munch-Peterson (CAMP) factor of P. acnes is a secretory protein with co-hemolytic activity with sphingomyelinase that can confer cytotoxicity to HaCaT keratinocytes and RAW264.7 macrophages. The CAMP factor from bacteria and acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) from the host cells were simultaneously present in the culture supernatant only when the cells were co-cultured with P. acnes. Either anti-CAMP factor serum or desipramine, a selective ASMase inhibitor, significantly abrogated the P. acnes-induced cell death of HaCaT and RAW264.7 cells. Intradermal injection of ICR mouse ears with live P. acnes induced considerable ear inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and an increase in cellular soluble ASMase. Suppression of ASMase by systemic treatment with desipramine significantly reduced inflammatory reaction induced by intradermal injection with P. acnes, suggesting the contribution of host ASMase in P. acnes-induced inflammatory reaction in vivo. Vaccination of mice with CAMP factor elicited a protective immunity against P. acnes-induced ear inflammation, indicating the involvement of CAMP factor in P. acnes-induced inflammation. Most notably, suppression of both bacterial CAMP factor and host ASMase using vaccination and specific antibody injection, respectively, cooperatively alleviated P. acnes-induced inflammation. Conclusions/Significance These findings envision a novel infectious mechanism by which P. acnes CAMP factor may hijack host ASMase to amplify bacterial virulence to degrade and invade host cells. This work has identified both CAMP factor and ASMase as potential molecular targets for the development of drugs and vaccines against acne vulgaris."

The molecular basis for Ca2+ release by NAADP, however, is uncertain. TRP mucolipins (TRPMLs) and two-pore channels (TPCs) are Ca2+-permeable ion channels present within the endolysosomal system. Both have been proposed as targets for NAADP. In the present study, we probed possible physical and functional association of these ion channels. Exogenously expressed TRPML1 showed near complete colocalization with TPC2 and partial colocalization with TPC1. TRPML3 overlap with TPC2 was more modest. TRPML1 and to some extent TRPML3 co-immunoprecipitated with TPC2 but less so with TPC1. Current recording, however, showed that TPC1 and TPC2 did not affect the activity of wild-type TRPML1 or constitutively active TRPML1(V432P). N-terminally truncated TPC2 (TPC2delN), which is targeted to the plasma membrane, also failed to affect TRPML1 and TRPML1(V432P) channel function or TRPML1(V432P)-mediated Ca2+ influx. Whereas overexpression of TPCs enhanced NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals, overexpression of TRPML1 did not, and the dominant negative TRPML1(D471K) was without affect on endogenous NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals. Furthermore, the single channel properties of NAADP-activated TPC2delN were not affected by TRPML1. Finally, NAADP-evoked Ca2+ oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells were identical in wild-type and TRPML1−/− cells.

IntroductionCa2+ plays a major role in the function of intracellular organelles including biosynthesis and membrane trafficking (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar, 2Kiselyov K. Yamaguchi S. Lyons C.W. Muallem S. Cell Calcium. 2010; 47: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism controlling Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum has been studied extensively, very little is known about Ca2+ homeostasis by other organelles. Furthermore, although accumulating evidence indicates that acidic organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes are dynamic Ca2+ stores, the molecular basis for Ca2+ release from these so-called “acidic Ca2+ stores” (3Patel S. Docampo R. Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) is at present defined poorly.By far, the best characterized route for mobilization of acidic Ca2+ stores is through the production of the potent Ca2+-releasing second messenger, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) 5The abbreviations used are: NAADPnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateTPCtwo-pore channelTRPML1transient receptor potential mucolipin 1[Ca2+]ifree cytoplasmic Ca2+EGFPenhanced GFPco-IPco-immunoprecipitation.

NAADP is produced by several extracellular stimuli in an agonist-specific manner and implicated in a number of physiological responses, including fertilization, glucose sensing, exocytosis, and neuronal growth (4Guse A.H.

Insertion of the gain-of-function mutation A419P in TRPML3 into the corresponding position in TRPML1(V432P), however, resulted in a constitutively active Ca2+-permeable channel (35Xu H. Delling M.

TRPML1 was suggested as the NAADP receptor based on the findings that NAADP-activated channel activity in a lipid bilayer reconstituted with lysosomal membranes was inhibited by an anti-TRPML1 antibody (10Zhang F.

These results, however, have yet to be independently verified and whether overexpression of TRPML1 potentiated NAADP responses was not tested.Although TPCs were first identified in the rat, most is known about these channels in plants. In Arabidopsis, TPC1 localizes in the vacuole where it mediates the slow vacuolar current (37Peiter E. Maathuis F.J. Mills L.N. Knight H. Pelloux J. Hetherington A.M. Sanders D. Nature. 2005; 434: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Transgenic approaches have identified many physiological processes that are regulated by plant TPC1, including germination and stomatal movement (38Pottosin II Schönknecht G. J. Exp. Bot. 2007; 58: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In animals, the TPC gene has undergone multiplication and divergence, giving rise to a family of three genes in most deuterostomes, including sea urchins, whereas, interestingly, only two isoforms (TPC1 and TPC2) are present in rats, mice, and humans (14Calcraft P.J.

Knockdown of human TPC1 and overexpression of TPC1 mutated in a predicted pore region (L273P) inhibits endogenous NAADP response in SKBR3 cells (16Brailoiu E. Churamani D. Cai X. Schrlau M.G.

NAADP responses are also abolished in pancreatic β cells from mice lacking the TPC2 gene (14Calcraft P.J. Ruas M. Pan Z. Cheng X. Arredouani A. Hao X. Tang J. Rietdorf K. Teboul L. Chuang K.T. Lin P.

These studies provide strong evidence that TPCs are NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ channels.Multiple lines of evidence thus suggest that TPCs are essential for NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release, but the reported involvement of TRPML1 in the NAADP response (10Zhang F. Li P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25259-25269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Zhang F. Jin S. Yi F. Li P.L. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2009; 13: 3174-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that TRPMLs and TPCs may interact. Here, we examined this issue by comparing their subcellular distribution and ability to form protein complexes. We also used several established experimental paradigms for probing TRPML and TPC/NAADP function, including TRPML1−/− mice. We report that although TRPMLs and TPCs are present in the same organelles and physically interact with each other, they function as independent organellar ion channels. We find no evidence for TRPML1 in regulating NAADP responses.CONCLUSIONSThe present results lead to three conclusions. First, TRPMLs and TPCs are present within a protein complex. Second, TPCs do not affect TRPML1 activity; and third, TRPML1 is not necessary for the NAADP response. The latter finding is particularly significant because the exact molecular nature of the NAADP receptor has been somewhat ambiguous (9Guse A.H. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R521-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our findings, including those using pancreatic acinar cells from TRPML1−/− mice (Fig. 6), provide firm evidence that TRPML1 is not a target for NAADP and support TPCs as NAADP-activated channels. Indeed, our conclusions are consistent with three recent studies reporting channel activity for TPC2 from isolated lysosomes, immunopurified TPC2 fused into lipid bilayers, or in cells expressing plasma membrane targeted TPC2 (42Brailoiu E.

Importantly, in two of these studies, currents were eliminated or modified by mutations in the putative channel pore (42Brailoiu E. Rahman T. Churamani D. Prole D.L. Brailoiu G.C. Hooper R. Taylor C.W. Patel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 38511-38516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 50Schieder M. Rötzer K. Brüggemann A. Biel M. Wahl-Schott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21219-21222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Assembly of TRPMLs and the TPCs into complexes in intracellular organelles is clearly specific, as evident from isoform specific differences in co-IP (Fig. 2), mirroring their differential localization (Figs. 1, 2, and 4). Moreover, N-terminally cleaved TRPML1 shows minimal co-IP with TPC1 (Fig. 2). The functional significance, if any, of complex assembly, however, is not known at present but may in part explain why in a previous study, NAADP-mediated channel activity was reduced following immunoprecipitation of lysosomal preparations with a TRPML1 antibody (11Zhang F. Jin S. Yi F. Li P.L. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2009; 13: 3174-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We note that, unlike TPCs, evidence that TRPML1 functions as a Ca2+ channel in the lysosomes or to participate in Ca2+ release from other intracellular organelles is limited. However, TRPML1 has been shown to regulate lysosomal pH (23Miedel M.T. Rbaibi Y. Guerriero C.J. Colletti G. Weixel K.M. Weisz O.A. Kiselyov K. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1477-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Soyombo A.A. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Rbaibi Y. Bashllari E. Bisceglia J. Muallem S. Kiselyov K. J. Biol.

Cell. 2008; 135: 838-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Based on the available evidence, we thus suggest that TRPMLs and the TPCs may have different functions within the endo/lysosomal system. TRPML1 may primarily control lysosomal pH, whereas TPCs likely mediate Ca2+ release from endosomes and lysosomes in response to NAADP. In this respect, it is of interest that TPC2 is sensitive to pH, with activation or functional modification by acidic pH (49Pitt S.J. Funnell T.M. Sitsapesan M. Venturi E. Rietdorf K. Ruas M. Ganesan A. Gosain R. Churchill G.C. Zhu M.X. Parrington J. Galione A. Sitsapesan R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2010; 285: 21219-21222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, it would have been expected that through regulation of lysosomal pH TRPML1 may regulate the function of the TPCs and thus lysosomal Ca2+ content and Ca2+ release. That we could not detect such a relationship may indicate that the range of changes in lysosomal pH by TRPML1 is not sufficient to affect TPC activity. However, further work is needed to determine a more subtle relationship between the two channels in lysosomal function. IntroductionCa2+ plays a major role in the function of intracellular organelles including biosynthesis and membrane trafficking (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar, 2Kiselyov K. Yamaguchi S. Lyons C.W. Muallem S. Cell Calcium. 2010; 47: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism controlling Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum has been studied extensively, very little is known about Ca2+ homeostasis by other organelles. Furthermore, although accumulating evidence indicates that acidic organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes are dynamic Ca2+ stores, the molecular basis for Ca2+ release from these so-called “acidic Ca2+ stores” (3Patel S. Docampo R. Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) is at present defined poorly.By far, the best characterized route for mobilization of acidic Ca2+ stores is through the production of the potent Ca2+-releasing second messenger, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) 5The abbreviations used are: NAADPnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateTPCtwo-pore channelTRPML1transient receptor potential mucolipin 1[Ca2+]ifree cytoplasmic Ca2+EGFPenhanced GFPco-IPco-immunoprecipitation.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), in which NAADP was shown to mobilize Ca2+ not from the endoplasmic reticulum but instead from lysosome-related organelles (6Churchill G.C.

Its effects have subsequently been extended to a variety of cell types, including pancreatic acinar and β cells, smooth muscle cells, neurons, and breast cancer cells (4Guse A.H. Lee H.C. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: re10Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). NAADP is produced by several extracellular stimuli in an agonist-specific manner and implicated in a number of physiological responses, including fertilization, glucose sensing, exocytosis, and neuronal growth (4Guse A.H. Lee H.C. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: re10Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Deregulated lysosomal Ca2+ signaling may also result in disease (2Kiselyov K. Yamaguchi S. Lyons C.W. Muallem S.

These results, however, have yet to be independently verified and whether overexpression of TRPML1 potentiated NAADP responses was not tested.Although TPCs were first identified in the rat, most is known about these channels in plants. In Arabidopsis, TPC1 localizes in the vacuole where it mediates the slow vacuolar current (37Peiter E. Maathuis F.J. Mills L.N. Knight H. Pelloux J. Hetherington A.M. Sanders D.

These studies provide strong evidence that TPCs are NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ channels.Multiple lines of evidence thus suggest that TPCs are essential for NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release, but the reported involvement of TRPML1 in the NAADP response (10Zhang F.

Here, we examined this issue by comparing their subcellular distribution and ability to form protein complexes. We also used several established experimental paradigms for probing TRPML and TPC/NAADP function, including TRPML1−/− mice. We report that although TRPMLs and TPCs are present in the same organelles and physically interact with each other, they function as independent organellar ion channels. We find no evidence for TRPML1 in regulating NAADP responses."
https://openalex.org/W2034588929,"Fluorescein-di-β-D-galactopyranoside (FDG), a fluorogenic compound, is hydrolyzed by β-galactosidase in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli to produce a fluorescent dye, fluorescein. We found that both FDG and fluorescein were substrates of efflux pumps, and have developed a new method to evaluate efflux-inhibitory activities in E. coli using FDG and a microfluidic channel device. We used E. coli MG1655 wild-type, ΔacrB (ΔB), ΔtolC (ΔC) and ΔacrBΔtolC (ΔBC) harboring plasmids carrying the mexAB-oprM (pABM) or mexXY-oprM (pXYM) genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two inhibitors, MexB-specific pyridopyrimidine (D13-9001) and non-specific Phe-Arg-β-naphthylamide (PAβN) were evaluated. The effects of inhibitors on pumps were observed using the microfluidic channel device under a fluorescence microscope. AcrAB-TolC and analogous pumps effectively prevented FDG influx in wild-type cells, resulting in no fluorescence. In contrast, ΔB or ΔC easily imported and hydrolyzed FDG to fluorescein, which was exported by residual pumps in ΔB. Consequently, fluorescent medium in ΔB and fluorescent cells of ΔC and ΔBC were observed in the microfluidic channels. D13-9001 substantially increased fluorescent cell number in ΔBC/pABM but not in ΔBC/pXYM. PAβN increased medium fluorescence in all strains, especially in the pump deletion mutants, and caused fluorescein accumulation to disappear in ΔC. The checkerboard method revealed that D13-9001 acts synergistically with aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin only against the MexAB-OprM producer (ΔBC/pABM), and PAβN acts synergistically, especially with erythromycin, in all strains including the pump deletion mutants. The results obtained from PAβN were similar to the results from membrane permeabilizer, polymyxin B or polymyxin B nonapeptide by concentration. The new method clarified that D13-9001 specifically inhibited MexAB-OprM in contrast to PAβN, which appeared to be a substrate of the pumps and permeabilized the membranes in E. coli."

Cell-surface gC1qR was concentrated in the lamellipodia along with CD44, monosialoganglioside, actin, and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase in cells stimulated with insulin, IGF-1, EGF, or serum. The growth factor-induced lamellipodia formation and cell migration were significantly decreased in gC1qR-depleted cells, with a concomitant blunt activation of the focal adhesion kinase and the respective receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, the gC1qR-depleted cells exhibited a reduced proliferation rate in culture as well as diminished tumorigenic and metastatic activities in grafted mice.

https://openalex.org/W2020976252,"Survivin was initially described as an inhibitor of apoptosis and attracted growing attention as one of the most tumor-specific genes in the human genome and a promising target for cancer therapy. Lately, it has been shown that survivin is a multifunctional protein that takes part in several crucial cell processes. At first, it was supposed that survivin functions only as a homodimer, but now data indicate that many processes require monomeric survivin. Moreover, recent studies reveal a special mechanism regulating the balance between monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein. In this paper we studied the mutant form of survivin that was unable to dimerize and investigated its role in apoptosis. We showed that survivin monomer interacts with Smac/DIABLO and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) both in vitro and in vivo. Due to this feature, it protects cells from caspase-dependent apoptosis even more efficiently than the wild-type survivin. We also identified that mutant monomeric survivin prevents apoptosis-inducing factor release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, protecting human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells from caspase-independent apoptosis. On the other hand, our results indicate that only wild-type survivin, but not the monomer mutant form, enhances tubulin stability in cells. These findings suggest that survivin partly performs its functions as a monomer and partly as a dimer. The mechanism of dimer-monomer balance regulation may also work as a ""switcher"" between survivin functions and thereby explain remarkable functional diversities of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1997203592,"Promoter-proximal pausing of RNAPII coincides with the formation of the cap structure at the 5' end of pre-mRNA, which is bound by the cap-binding protein complex (CBC). Although the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) stimulates the release of RNAPII from pausing and promotes transcription elongation and alternative splicing by phosphorylating the RNAPII C-terminal domain at Ser2 (S2-P RNAPII), it is unknown whether CBC facilitates these events. In this study, we report that CBC interacts with P-TEFb and transcriptionally engaged RNAPII and is globally required for optimal levels of S2-P RNAPII. Quantitative nascent RNA immunoprecipitation and ChIP experiments reveal that depletion of CBC attenuates HIV-1 Tat transactivation and impedes transcription elongation of investigated CBC-dependent endogenous genes by decreasing the levels of P-TEFb and S2-P RNAPII, leading to accumulation of RNAPII in the body of these genes. Finally, CBC is essential for the promotion of alternative splicing through facilitating P-TEFb, S2-P RNAPII, and splicing factor 2/alternative splicing factor occupancy at a splicing minigene. These findings disclose a vital role of CBC in connecting pre-mRNA capping to transcription elongation and alternative splicing via P-TEFb."
https://openalex.org/W2016245839,"Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is characterized by the development of mesenchymal properties such as a fibroblast-like morphology with altered cytoskeletal organization and enhanced migratory potential. We report that the expression of podocalyxin (PODXL), a member of the CD34 family, is markedly increased during TGF-β induced EMT. PODXL is enriched on the leading edges of migrating A549 cells. Silencing of podocalyxin expression reduced cell ruffle formation, spreading, migration and affected the expression patterns of several proteins that normally change during EMT (e.g., vimentin, E-cadherin). Cytoskeleton assembly in EMT was also found to be dependent on the production of podocalyin. Compositional analysis of podocalyxin containing immunoprecipitates revealed that collagen type 1 was consistently associated with these isolates. Collagen type 1 was also found to co-localize with podocalyxin on the leading edges of migrating cells. The interactions with collagen may be a critical aspect of podocalyxin function. Podocalyxin is an important regulator of the EMT like process as it regulates the loss of epithelial features and the acquisition of a motile phenotype."

An important mechanism of Creb activation of Pgc-1α in this pathway is the activation and nuclear translocation of CRTC, a family of Creb co-activators that are known to respond to metabolic stress mediated through cAMP- dependent protein kinase (PKA) or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (6Wang Y.

Although mitochondrial biogenesis occurs in response to metabolic signals, we were interested in what mediates mitochondrial biogenesis and stress response when mitochondria are stressed. Using liver cells as our model system, we were particularly interested in exploring the possibility that mitochondrial stress by a mitochondria-specific toxin, rotenone, which inhibits complex I (9Singer T.P. Ramsay R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), leads to a unique signaling pathway. Furthermore, because Crtc2 and Crtc3 are expressed in liver cells, we wished to test the hypothesis that their respective roles might be different in metabolic versus mitochondrial stress signaling in leading to Creb activation, induction of Pgc-1α, and subsequent up-regulation of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins including transcription regulators, electron transport components, and chaperones.DISCUSSIONStress responses to oxidants/redox perturbations and protein malfolding have been increasingly recognized as crucial adaptive mechanisms in balancing the promotion of and resistance to cellular injury (33Kaplowitz N.

Such responses are mediated by the activation of transcription factors that regulate the expression of sets of genes that control organelle biogenesis as well as organelle-specific protective chaperones. Specific responses to stress in cellular compartments are mediated by distinct transducers.

We confirmed the importance of Pgc-1α in mitochondrial biogenesis in response to rotenone by showing that Pgc-1α induction preceded mitochondria biogenesis and that silencing Pgc-1α blocked the downstream expression of mitochondrial transcription factors and structural genes. The signaling mechanisms for Creb activation in metabolic scenarios involves cAMP-dependent release of Crtc2 from 14-3-3 as well as direct effects of PKA on Creb (3Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G. Jeffries S. Guzman E. Niessen S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Takemori H. Okamoto M. Montminy M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). Our work is unique in addressing the effect of mitochondrial stress on the CREB-PGC-1α pathway. We were interested in the question of whether mitochondrial biogenesis in response to mitochondrial stress induced by mitochondrial toxin, rotenone, is dependent on CRTC, and particularly whether there is a differential contribution of Crtc2 versus Crtc3 in mediating the response. We examined this question by silencing the expression of Crtc2 or Crtc3 and then exposing primary mouse hepatocytes and HepG2 cells to rotenone and determining the expression of nuclear genes encoding transcription factors, mitochondrial structural proteins, as well as mitochondrial chaperones such as Hsp10 and Hsp60, which reflect mitochondrial biogenesis. Most importantly, when Crtc3 was silenced, mitochondrial biogenesis in response to a mitochondrial toxin was inhibited, whereas silencing Crtc2 did not inhibit this response. Crtc3, but not Crtc2, was associated with CREB at the Pgc-1α promoter (ChIP assay), indicating that Crtc3 translocates to this site at the time Pgc-1α expression is induced in response to rotenone.We do not have a complete understanding of the mechanism for the selectivity of the response of Crtc3. Both Crtc2 and Crtc3 are mainly sequestered in cytosol as phosphorylated forms bound to 14-3-3 (1Conkright M.D. Canettieri G. Screaton R. Guzman E. Miraglia L. Hogenesch J.B. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 413-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and a small fraction of both is found in the ER. We did not find an increase in nonphosphorylated forms or a decrease in total Crtc2 or Crtc3 in cytosol in response to rotenone (not shown). However, we did identify a small fraction of Crtc3, but not Crtc2, in mitochondria (not shown), the significance of which is uncertain at present. Thus, the mechanism of selective Crtc3 activation may reflect some signal from mitochondria induced by rotenone (e.g. reactive oxygen species), which activates a subfraction of Crtc3 in cytosol, or it may reflect release of Crtc3 from mitochondria; this mitochondrial Crtc3 presumably would need to be modified so as to resist the sequestration mechanism known for the cytoplasmic pool of Crtc3.We also found that the expression of Crtc2 and Crtc3 increased at later times after the initial Crtc3-mediated activation of Creb and induction of Pgc-1α expression. It seems likely that the later transcriptional up-regulation of Crtc2 and Crtc3, possibly in a redundant fashion, is a feed-forward amplification mechanism in mitochondrial biogenesis. At present, it is clear that the response to mitochondria-specific toxic stress does not occur in the absence of Crtc3 but that Crtc2 is dispensable.In the future, our findings will need to be considered in the context of the proposed mitochondrial stress response in which chaperone induction is mediated by C/EBP-homologous protein (51Horibe T.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) of mitochondrial stress response did not address mitochondrial biogenesis. Whether Crtc3 activation participates in the context of the response to malfolding of mitochondrial proteins will need to be addressed in future studies.

An important mechanism of Creb activation of Pgc-1α in this pathway is the activation and nuclear translocation of CRTC, a family of Creb co-activators that are known to respond to metabolic stress mediated through cAMP- dependent protein kinase (PKA) or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (6Wang Y.

Although mitochondrial biogenesis occurs in response to metabolic signals, we were interested in what mediates mitochondrial biogenesis and stress response when mitochondria are stressed. Using liver cells as our model system, we were particularly interested in exploring the possibility that mitochondrial stress by a mitochondria-specific toxin, rotenone, which inhibits complex I (9Singer T.P. Ramsay R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), leads to a unique signaling pathway. Furthermore, because Crtc2 and Crtc3 are expressed in liver cells, we wished to test the hypothesis that their respective roles might be different in metabolic versus mitochondrial stress signaling in leading to Creb activation, induction of Pgc-1α, and subsequent up-regulation of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins including transcription regulators, electron transport components, and chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W1991085977,"We previously demonstrated that iron deprivation enhances drug susceptibility of Candida albicans by increasing membrane fluidity which correlated with the lower expression of ERG11 transcript and ergosterol levels. The iron restriction dependent membrane perturbations led to an increase in passive diffusion and drug susceptibility. The mechanisms underlying iron homeostasis and multidrug resistance (MDR), however, are not yet resolved. To evaluate the potential mechanisms, we used whole genome transcriptome and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) based lipidome analyses of iron deprived Candida cells to examine the new cellular circuitry of the MDR of this pathogen. Our transcriptome data revealed a link between calcineurin signaling and iron homeostasis. Among the several categories of iron deprivation responsive genes, the down regulation of calcineurin signaling genes including HSP90, CMP1 and CRZ1 was noteworthy. Interestingly, iron deprived Candida cells as well as iron acquisition defective mutants phenocopied molecular chaperone HSP90 and calcineurin mutants and thus were sensitive to alkaline pH, salinity and membrane perturbations. In contrast, sensitivity to above stresses did not change in iron deprived DSY2146 strain with a hyperactive allele of calcineurin. Although, iron deprivation phenocopied compromised HSP90 and calcineurin, it was independent of protein kinase C signaling cascade. Notably, the phenotypes associated with iron deprivation in genetically impaired calcineurin and HSP90 could be reversed with iron supplementation. The observed down regulation of ergosterol (ERG1, ERG2, ERG11 and ERG25) and sphingolipid biosynthesis (AUR1 and SCS7) genes followed by lipidome analysis confirmed that iron deprivation not only disrupted ergosterol biosynthesis, but it also affected sphingolipid homeostasis in Candida cells. These lipid compositional changes suggested extensive remodeling of the membranes in iron deprived Candida cells. Taken together, our data provide the first novel insight into the intricate relationship between cellular iron, calcineurin signaling, membrane lipid homeostasis and drug susceptibility of Candida cells."

Here, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of TIN2 with DC missense mutations in human cells led to accelerated telomere shortening, similar to the telomere phenotypes found in DC patients. However, this telomere shortening was not accompanied by changes in total telomerase activity, localization of TIN2, or telomere end protection status. Interestingly, we found TIN2 to participate in the TPP1-dependent recruitment of telomerase activity. Furthermore, DC mutations in TIN2 led to its decreased ability to associate with TERC and telomerase activity.

Blood. 2008; 112: 3594-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In addition to DC, mutations of TINF2 were also identified in patients with other diseases associated with bone marrow failure (e.g. ataxia-pancytopenia and aplastic anemia) (6Walne A.J. Vulliamy T.

TIN2 plays a central role in the assembly and function of the six-protein complex, connecting the double-stranded DNA-binding proteins TRF1 (telomere repeat binding factor) and TRF2 to the single-stranded DNA-binding unit TPP1/POT1. However, the relationship between TIN2 dysfunction and DC and the consequences of TIN2 mutations remain to be elucidated. Here, we report our investigation of the mechanism through which TIN2 mutations may contribute to telomere shortening. Using telomerase-positive human cells that ectopically expressed TIN2 mutants, we recapitulated the telomere shortening observed in DC patients and provided the potential links between such defects and the recruitment of telomerase. cDNAs encoding human wild-type and mutant TIN2 (K280E, R282H, and R282S) and dyskerin were cloned into a pCL-based retroviral vector (c-terminal FLAG or 2×FLAG) for transient expression in 293T cells or stable expression in HTC75 cells. cDNAs encoding human TRF1, TRF2, and TPP1 were cloned into the vector pDEST-27 (GST tag; Invitrogen) for expression in 293T cells. Doxycycline-inducible cell lines were established using HT1080 cells. Various TIN2 (wild-type, K280E, R282H, R282S, and Δ90) and TPP1 (wild-type, ΔOB, ΔC22, and ΔOBΔC22) constructs were cloned into a pHAGE-based SFB tag lentiviral vector (C-terminal S-, FLAG-, and streptavidin-binding tag; doxycycline-inducible expression) (30Kim H. Lee O.H. Xin H. Chen L.Y. Qin J. Chae H.K. Lin S.Y. Safari A. Liu D. Songyang Z. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For protein expression induction, 8.5–200 ng/ml doxycycline was used. TPP1-ΔOB contains residues 244–544. TPP1-ΔC22 includes residues 1–522. TPP1-ΔOBΔC22 spans residues 244–522. The knockdown shRNA sequences of TIN2 (5′-GGAGCACATTCTTTGCCTG-3′), TPP1 (5′-GTGGTACCAGCATCAGCCTT-3′), and GFP (5′-CACAAGCTGGAGTACAACT-3′) were cloned into a retroviral vector as described previously (31O'Connor M.S. Safari A. Xin H. Liu D. Songyang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11874-11879Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed as described previously (30Kim H. Lee O.H. Xin H. Chen L.Y. Qin J. Chae H.K. Lin S.Y. Safari A. Liu D. Songyang Z. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), where cells transiently expressing various proteins were lysed in 1× buffer containing 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and proteinase inhibitor mixture. GST fusion proteins were pulled down by glutathione-agarose beads (Molecular Probes). The antibodies used were HRP-conjugated anti-GST polyclonal antibody (GE Healthcare), HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma), rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma), goat anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Epitomics, Inc.), mouse anti-TRF2 monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem), rabbit anti-RAP1 polyclonal antibody (Bethyl Laboratories), rabbit anti-TPP1 and anti-TIN2 polyclonal antibodies (32Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and goat anti-TRF1 antibody (31O'Connor M.S. Safari A. Xin H. Liu D. Songyang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11874-11879Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To measure total cellular telomerase activity, TRAP assays were performed using the gel-based TRAPeze telomerase detection kit (Millipore) as described previously (27Xin H. Liu D. Wan M. Safari A. Kim H. Sun W. O'Connor M.S. Songyang Z. Nature. 2007; 445: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in CHAPS buffer and centrifuged. The supernatant was collected and diluted before the two-step TRAP assay. The amplified DNA was resolved on a 12% Tris/borate/EDTA polyacrylamide gel and visualized with SYBR Green I (Invitrogen). 5–10 × 106 cells were lysed in high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.42 m KCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) on ice for 30 min. The lysates were then diluted with 5 volumes of low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected for immunoprecipitations with the appropriate antibodies. FLAG- or SFB-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose beads (Sigma) and eluted in 180 μl of elution buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 136 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and protease and RNase inhibitor) with FLAG or 3×FLAG peptides (Sigma), respectively. The eluants were then diluted 3–5-fold before being used for Q-TRAP. For cell lines in which TIN2 expression was induced to endogenous levels, no dilution of the FLAG eluant was needed prior to Q-TRAP. Q-TRAP was carried out essentially as described (33Herbert B.S. Hochreiter A.E. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1583-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Each 25-μl Q-TRAP reaction contained 2 μl of FLAG-eluted immunoprecipitates, 100 ng of TS primer (5′-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT-3′), 100 ng of ACX primer (5′-GCGCGGCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTAACC-3′), and 1 mm EGTA in SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then PCR-amplified in 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s using an ABI StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Real-time qPCR was performed as described previously (34Liang J. Wan M. Zhang Y. Gu P. Xin H. Jung S.Y. Qin J. Wong J. Cooney A.J. Liu D. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). For qPCR of TERC following immunoprecipitation, the eluted immunoprecipitates were incubated at 85 °C for 7 min and then directly used for reverse transcription using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time qPCR amplification was carried out using SYBR Green Master Mix and the ABI StepOnePlus real-time PCR system. For detection of TERC, the primers used were 5′-TCTAACCCTAACTGAGAAGGGCGTAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTTGCTCTAGAATGAACGGTGGAAG-3′ (reverse) (35Nakamura T.M. Morin G.B. Chapman K.B. Weinrich S.L. Andrews W.H. Lingner J. Harley C.B. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 277: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar). The 18 S primers used were 5′-CGAACGTCTGCCCTATCAACTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCCGTGGTCACCATGGTA-3′ (reverse). HTC75 cells stably expressing control and FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant TIN2 proteins were generated and passaged for TRF analysis as described previously (32Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The results were analyzed using TeloRun (36Ouellette M.M. Liao M. Herbert B.S.

Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and then blocked with 3% goat serum. To detect telomere dysfunction-induced foci, cells were co-stained with anti-TRF2 monoclonal antibody and anti-53BP1 polyclonal antibody (27Xin H. Liu D. Wan M. Safari A. Kim H. Sun W. O'Connor M.S. Songyang Z. Nature. 2007; 445: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). DAPI was used to visualize the nuclei. HTC75 cells expressing wild-type or mutant TIN2 were plated onto 6-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well and maintained for 1 week. At the indicated time points, cells were trypsinized and counted. Cells were fixed with cold 70% ethanol and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS containing 0.2 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A. Cells were then analyzed with an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). To date, a total of 18 TIN2 mutations in 43 DC patients have been reported (supplemental Fig. S1A) (6Walne A.J. Vulliamy T. Beswick R. Kirwan M. Dokal I. Blood. 2008; 112: 3594-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 7Savage S.A. Giri N. Baerlocher G.M. Orr N. Lansdorp P.M. Alter B.P. Am. J. Hum.

These mutations are tightly clustered in a small region (amino acids 269–298) that is highly conserved across mammalian species (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1B). Of these, Lys-280 and Arg-282 appear to be mutation hot spots, with K280E, R282H, and R282S mutations found in ∼50% of the patients. We first studied these three missense mutations in telomerase-positive human cells to determine whether telomere length maintenance was affected. Human fibrosarcoma HTC75 cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant TIN2 proteins that were FLAG-tagged at the C terminus were generated. These exogenous TIN2 proteins were expressed at a level comparable with each other (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), although telomere length remained fairly constant in control cells, expression of wild-type TIN2 led to gradual and progressive shortening of telomeres, consistent with the role of TIN2 as a negative regulator of telomere length (37Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 38Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In comparison, expression of the TIN2 mutants led to accelerated telomere shortening. In fact, this phenotype was apparent as early as population doubling (PD) 15. It is possible that this difference in telomere length resulted from differences in cell proliferation. However, the growth rates and cell cycle progression of wild-type and mutant TIN2 cells were indistinguishable from those of control cells (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S2A). Taken together, our results indicate that ectopic expression of TIN2 mutants in HTC75 cells recapitulated the telomere shortening defect in DC, providing a useful system to study the underlying mechanism of TIN2 dysfunction and DC. DC patients with mutations in TERC, TERT, DKC1, NOP10, and NHP2 exhibit reduced telomerase activity and decreased TERC levels (9Armanios M. Chen J.L. Chang Y.P. Brodsky R.A. Hawkins A. Griffin C.A.

Genet. 2004; 115: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether TIN2 mutants could also affect TERC levels and telomerase activity. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), expression of TIN2 missense mutants did not appear to affect total telomerase activities as measured by TRAP assays. In addition, real-time PCR analysis revealed no significant difference in TERC levels among cells expressing wild-type or mutant TIN2 (Fig. 2C). Although TRAP assays are limited in terms of precise quantification, these data are nonetheless consistent with findings in DC patients with TIN2 mutations (6Walne A.J. Vulliamy T. Beswick R. Kirwan M. Dokal I. Blood. 2008; 112: 3594-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and suggest that the molecular mechanism responsible for TIN2-related DC may differ from that for classic DC. Changes in any of the six core telomeric proteins (TIN2, TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, TPP1, and POT1) are known to affect each other. For example, depletion of TIN2 by siRNA results in a reduction of the TRF1 protein level (37Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the stability of TPP1 is dependent on TIN2 levels and vice versa (28Abreu E. Aritonovska E. Reichenbach P. Cristofari G. Culp B. Terns R.M. Lingner J. Terns M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2971-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the abundance of individual core telomeric proteins has a great influence on telomere length homeostasis. Inhibition of TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, TIN2, TPP1, or POT1 leads to elongated telomeres (37Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 42O'Connor M.S.

Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 46van Steensel B. de Lange T.

We therefore postulated that DC mutations of TIN2 might affect the expression of TIN2 and other telomeric proteins. To this end, we analyzed the expression of the six core telomeric proteins by immunoblotting using PD18 and PD65 of the cells from Fig. 1. The expression of wild-type and mutant TIN2 proteins appeared similar and did not change with long-term passage (Fig. 3A). As expected (28Abreu E. Aritonovska E. Reichenbach P. Cristofari G. Culp B. Terns R.M. Lingner J. Terns M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2971-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 37Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), ectopic expression of TIN2 (either wild-type or mutant) led to an increased total amount of endogenous TRF1 and TPP1, but not TRF2 and RAP1 (Fig. 3A). Importantly, even at PD65, when telomere length differed significantly between the cells (Fig. 1D), little variation in the protein levels of TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, and TPP1 could be observed in wild-type versus mutant TIN2 cells (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S2B). These data indicate that TIN2 mutations have little effect on the expression or stability of the other core telomeric proteins. TIN2 interacts with TRF2 and TPP1 through its N terminus and with TRF1 through a domain located close to the DC mutation hot spot (Fig. 1A) (23Liu D. O'Connor M.S. Qin J. Songyang Z. J. Biol.

Giri N. Baerlocher G.M. Orr N. Lansdorp P.M. Alter B.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 82: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To test this idea, we carried out pulldown experiments in HEK293 cells transiently coexpressing TIN2 and other telomeric proteins. FLAG-tagged wild-type TIN2 or mutants were coexpressed with GST-tagged TRF1, TRF2, or TPP1. Consistent with our data on endogenous proteins (Fig. 3A), TIN2 mutants had no impact on the expression of GST-tagged TRF1, TRF2, or TPP1 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, these mutants retained their ability to interact with other telomeric proteins (Fig. 3B). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using differently tagged TIN2 and telomeric proteins showed similar results (supplemental Fig. S3). Together, these results support the notion that the interaction with core telomeric proteins remains intact for TIN2 with DC mutations. An additional level of regulation of telomeric proteins involves subcellular localization. Although the six core telomeric proteins are all targeted to the telomeres, some of them can be found in other cellular compartments as well (51Deng Z. Atanasiu C. Burg J.S. Broccoli D.

A single amino acid mutation in the nuclear export signal of TPP1 can disrupt its nuclear export as well as telomere maintenance (54Chen L.Y. Liu D. Songyang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5898-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To address whether a similar phenomenon can be observed with TIN2 DC mutations, we introduced GFP-tagged wild-type and mutant TIN2 into HTC75 cells. In all cases, GFP signals could be found in both the nucleu"
https://openalex.org/W2126315887,"Congenital long QT syndrome 2 (LQT2) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the human ether-á-go-go-related gene (hERG) voltage-gated potassium (K+) channel. hERG channels have slow deactivation kinetics that are regulated by an N-terminal Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain. Only a small percentage of hERG channels containing PAS domain LQT2 mutations (hERG PAS-LQT2) have been characterized in mammalian cells, so the functional effect of these mutations is unclear. We investigated 11 hERG PAS-LQT2 channels in HEK293 cells and report a diversity of functional defects. Most hERG PAS-LQT2 channels formed functional channels at the plasma membrane, as measured by whole cell patch clamp recordings and cell surface biotinylation. Mutations located on one face of the PAS domain (K28E, F29L, N33T, R56Q, and M124R) caused defective channel gating, including faster deactivation kinetics and less steady-state inactivation. Conversely, the other mutations caused no measurable differences in channel gating (G53R, H70R, and A78P) or no measurable currents (Y43C, C66G, and L86R). We used a genetically encoded hERG PAS domain (NPAS) to examine whether channel dysfunction could be corrected. We found that NPAS fully restored wild-type-like deactivation kinetics and steady-state inactivation to the hERG PAS-LQT2 channels. Additionally, NPAS rescued aberrant currents in hERG R56Q channels during a dynamic ramp voltage clamp. Thus, our results reveal a putative “gating face” in the PAS domain where mutations within this region form functional channels with altered gating properties, and we show that NPAS is a general means for rescuing aberrant gating in hERG LQT2 mutant channels and may be a potential biological therapeutic. Congenital long QT syndrome 2 (LQT2) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the human ether-á-go-go-related gene (hERG) voltage-gated potassium (K+) channel. hERG channels have slow deactivation kinetics that are regulated by an N-terminal Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain. Only a small percentage of hERG channels containing PAS domain LQT2 mutations (hERG PAS-LQT2) have been characterized in mammalian cells, so the functional effect of these mutations is unclear. We investigated 11 hERG PAS-LQT2 channels in HEK293 cells and report a diversity of functional defects. Most hERG PAS-LQT2 channels formed functional channels at the plasma membrane, as measured by whole cell patch clamp recordings and cell surface biotinylation. Mutations located on one face of the PAS domain (K28E, F29L, N33T, R56Q, and M124R) caused defective channel gating, including faster deactivation kinetics and less steady-state inactivation. Conversely, the other mutations caused no measurable differences in channel gating (G53R, H70R, and A78P) or no measurable currents (Y43C, C66G, and L86R). We used a genetically encoded hERG PAS domain (NPAS) to examine whether channel dysfunction could be corrected. We found that NPAS fully restored wild-type-like deactivation kinetics and steady-state inactivation to the hERG PAS-LQT2 channels. Additionally, NPAS rescued aberrant currents in hERG R56Q channels during a dynamic ramp voltage clamp. Thus, our results reveal a putative “gating face” in the PAS domain where mutations within this region form functional channels with altered gating properties, and we show that NPAS is a general means for rescuing aberrant gating in hERG LQT2 mutant channels and may be a potential biological therapeutic.

J. 2005; 88: 566-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the mechanism for how PAS domain mutations disrupt hERG function when expressed in more physiological conditions remains unclear.Previously, we showed that slow deactivation could be restored in LQT2 mutant hERG R56Q channels by application of a genetically encoded PAS domain (NPAS) in Xenopus oocytes (15Gustina A.S. Trudeau M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13082-13087Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to determine whether NPAS was a general mechanism for rescue of LQT2 mutant channels. To carry out this goal we investigated 1) whether 11 different hERG PAS-LQT2 mutations that were gating deficient in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a loss-of-function in a human heterologous expression system and 2) whether NPAS could restore gating in several different hERG PAS-LQT2 mutant channels with gating defects in a mammalian system.We found that the 11 hERG PAS-LQT2 channels exhibited a spectrum of deficiencies in mammalian cells, and only channels with mutations located on one face of the PAS domain were gating deficient. These mutant channels exhibited an array of gating defects, including faster deactivation kinetics and a right-shift in the steady-state inactivation relationship, the combination of which resulted in aberrant currents in response to a dynamic ramp clamp. We found that NPAS rescued gating defects in hERG PAS-LQT2 channels by inducing slower deactivation kinetics and a left-shift in the steady-state inactivation relationship, which restored wild-type-like currents during the dynamic ramp clamp. Thus, NPAS restored function to channels that had a variety of gating defects. Therefore, in this study, we identify a putative “gating face” within the PAS domain, as well as present a general means for rescuing gating-deficient mutant hERG PAS-LQT2 channels.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated hERG channels bearing LQT2 mutations in the PAS domain (hERG PAS-LQT2) in a mammalian expression system. Our findings demonstrated that hERG PAS-LQT2 channels exhibited a spectrum of biochemical and functional defects (summarized in Table 2). Most hERG PAS-LQT2 channels (K28E, F29L, N33T, G53R, R56Q, H70R, A78P, and M124R) formed functional ion channels at the cell surface because they exhibited neutravidin-purified biotinylated bands on a Western blot and ionic currents as measured with whole cell patch clamp recordings. Two of the mutant channels (Y43C and L86R) did not have measurable ionic currents or measurable neutravidin-purified biotinylated bands. Instead, these channels had a band on a Western blot of whole cell lysates that corresponded to the immature form of hERG, indicating that these mutant channels most likely had defects in protein maturation. One mutant channel (C66G) had no measurable ionic current and only a faint mature band on a Western blot, but did show an immature band on blots of neutravidin-purified biotinylated samples. We propose that the immature form of hERG may be localized at the plasma membrane in these conditions but that these channels are non-functional. Our data with hERG C66G and L86R are different from previous reports from oocytes that showed robust currents (14Chen J. Zou A. Splawski I. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10113-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for differences in channel expression between oocytes (previous study) and HEK293 cells (this study) is a temperature-sensitive folding defect that is apparent with differences in culture temperature for oocytes (16 °C) versus HEK293 cells (37 °C), as described for other hERG LQT2 mutant channels (16Furutani M.

Open table in a new tab Here we found that 5 hERG-PAS-LQT2 mutant channels (K28E, F29L, N33T, R56Q, and M124R) exhibited altered gating, including accelerated deactivation kinetics, a positive, rightward shift in the steady-state inactivation curve, and increased steady-state channel availability compared with WT hERG. The largest differences in gating and steady-state properties were seen in hERG R56Q. Also, we found that the resurgent hERG R56Q current was larger during depolarization than WT hERG but was smaller during repolarization, especially at voltages less than −60 mV compared with WT hERG (see Fig. 6E). We propose that the shift in time of the resurgent peak current and the smaller resurgent current at hyperpolarized voltages in hERG R56Q (see Fig. 6E) may be proarrhythmic.As the hERG PAS domain is a highly ordered structure, we wanted to know if there was a relationship between the functional defect and the specific location of each LQT2 mutation. We noticed that the LQT2 mutations that altered gating were situated on the same face of the PAS domain (6Morais Cabral J.H. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Li M. Mackinnon R. Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 7A); in contrast, the mutations that either had no effect on kinetics or abolished currents lie elsewhere on the PAS domain. The lone exception to this rule was Y43C, which was also located on the common face but exhibited defects in channel biogenesis. Our data are in agreement with previous work performed with Xenopus oocytes in which LQT2 mutations (13Al-Owais M. Bracey K. Wray D. Eur. Biophys. J. 2009; 38: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Chen J. Zou A. Splawski I. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that affected deactivation were located within a common region of the PAS domain. Previous studies described a hydrophobic patch in the PAS domain, within which lies Phe-29 and Tyr-43, where mutations located in this region caused an increase in the kinetics of deactivation (6Morais Cabral J.H. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Li M. Mackinnon R. Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because non-hydrophobic sites, especially Arg-56 (15Gustina A.S. Trudeau M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13082-13087Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), strongly regulate deactivation, we propose that both hydrophobic and non-hydrophobic residues located nearby one another make up a putative gating face on the PAS domain (Fig. 7A), which regulates deactivation and inactivation either allosterically or by forming a direct interaction with another part of the channel, perhaps the C-terminal region (30Gustina A.S. Trudeau M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Understanding the molecular defect of each hERG LQT2 channel gives insight into potential mechanisms for restoring WT-like function to mutant channels. To this end, we tested whether a genetically encoded hERG PAS domain (NPAS) (15Gustina A.S. Trudeau M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13082-13087Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was a general tool to rescue hERG PAS-LQT2 channels in HEK293 cells. We found that NPAS specifically slowed and restored aberrant deactivation gating in hERG PAS-LQT2 channels. We also found that NPAS specifically left-shifted and restored steady-state inactivation gating in the mutant channels and also specifically left-shifted and restored the steady-state activation curve of hERG N33T. NPAS also decreased and restored steady-state channel availability in hERG N33T and R56Q (see Fig. 5C). Notably, NPAS fully rescued the defective resurgent current properties of hERG R56Q in response to a dynamic ramp clamp. Our findings demonstrate that NPAS is a general means for rescuing gating-defective hERG LQT2 mutant channels.In a model we propose to explain the rescue of gating properties by NPAS shown here (Fig. 7B), hERG PAS-LQT2 channels exhibit altered deactivation kinetics and steady-state inactivation properties because critical protein interactions between the PAS domain and the channel were disrupted. NPAS physically interacts with the channel and supplants the covalently attached, mutated PAS domain, thus restoring WT-like deactivation kinetics and steady-state inactivation properties. Recently, the notion of using biological alternatives, such as gene therapy, as treatment options for arrhythmogenic diseases like LQT2 was explored (31Cho H.C. Marbán E. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 674-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our findings show that NPAS is a useful tool for rescuing gating-deficient mutant hERG channels, and we propose that NPAS may be a potential biological therapeutic for LQT2.

Trudeau M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13082-13087Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to determine whether NPAS was a general mechanism for rescue of LQT2 mutant channels. To carry out this goal we investigated 1) whether 11 different hERG PAS-LQT2 mutations that were gating deficient in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a loss-of-function in a human heterologous expression system and 2) whether NPAS could restore gating in several different hERG PAS-LQT2 mutant channels with gating defects in a mammalian system.We found that the 11 hERG PAS-LQT2 channels exhibited a spectrum of deficiencies in mammalian cells, and only channels with mutations located on one face of the PAS domain were gating deficient. These mutant channels exhibited an array of gating defects, including faster deactivation kinetics and a right-shift in the steady-state inactivation relationship, the combination of which resulted in aberrant currents in response to a dynamic ramp clamp. We found that NPAS rescued gating defects in hERG PAS-LQT2 channels by inducing slower deactivation kinetics and a left-shift in the steady-state inactivation relationship, which restored wild-type-like currents during the dynamic ramp clamp. Thus, NPAS restored function to channels that had a variety of gating defects. Therefore, in this study, we identify a putative “gating face” within the PAS domain, as well as present a general means for rescuing gating-deficient mutant hERG PAS-LQT2 channels.

DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated hERG channels bearing LQT2 mutations in the PAS domain (hERG PAS-LQT2) in a mammalian expression system. Our findings demonstrated that hERG PAS-LQT2 channels exhibited a spectrum of biochemical and functional defects (summarized in Table 2). Most hERG PAS-LQT2 channels (K28E, F29L, N33T, G53R, R56Q, H70R, A78P, and M124R) formed functional ion channels at the cell surface because they exhibited neutravidin-purified biotinylated bands on a Western blot and ionic currents as measured with whole cell patch clamp recordings. Two of the mutant channels (Y43C and L86R) did not have measurable ionic currents or measurable neutravidin-purified biotinylated bands. Instead, these channels had a band on a Western blot of whole cell lysates that corresponded to the immature form of hERG, indicating that these mutant channels most likely had defects in protein maturation. One mutant channel (C66G) had no measurable ionic current and only a faint mature band on a Western blot, but did show an immature band on blots of neutravidin-purified biotinylated samples. We propose that the immature form of hERG may be localized at the plasma membrane in these conditions but that these channels are non-functional. Our data with hERG C66G and L86R are different from previous reports from oocytes that showed robust currents (14Chen J. Zou A. Splawski I. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10113-10118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for differences in channel expression between oocytes (previous study) and HEK293 cells (this study) is a temperature-sensitive folding defect that is apparent with differences in culture temperature for oocytes (16 °C) versus HEK293 cells (37 °C), as described for other hERG LQT2 mutant channels (16Furutani M.

Open table in a new tab Here we found that 5 hERG-PAS-LQT2 mutant channels (K28E, F29L, N33T, R56Q, and M124R) exhibited altered gating, including accelerated deactivation kinetics, a positive, rightward shift in the steady-state inactivation curve, and increased steady-state channel availability compared with WT hERG. The largest differences in gating and steady-state properties were seen in hERG R56Q. Also, we found that the resurgent hERG R56Q current was larger during depolarization than WT hERG but was smaller during repolarization, especially at voltages less than −60 mV compared with WT hERG (see Fig. 6E). We propose that the shift in time of the resurgent peak current and the smaller resurgent current at hyperpolarized voltages in hERG R56Q (see Fig. 6E) may be proarrhythmic.As the hERG PAS domain is a highly ordered structure, we wanted to know if there was a relationship between the functional defect and the specific location of each LQT2 mutation. We noticed that the LQT2 mutations that altered gating were situated on the same face of the PAS domain (6Morais Cabral J.H. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Li M. Mackinnon R. Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 7A); in contrast, the mutations that either had no effect on kinetics or abolished currents lie elsewhere on the PAS domain. The lone exception to this rule was Y43C, which was also located on the common face but exhibited defects in channel biogenesis. Our data are in agreement with previous work performed with Xenopus oocytes in which LQT2 mutations (13Al-Owais M. Bracey K. Wray D. Eur. Biophys. J. 2009; 38: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Chen J. Zou A. Splawski I. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that affected deactivation were located within a common region of the PAS domain. Previous studies described a hydrophobic patch in the PAS domain, within which lies Phe-29 and Tyr-43, where mutations located in this region caused an increase in the kinetics of deactivation (6Morais Cabral J.H. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Li M. Mackinnon R. Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because non-hydrophobic sites, especially Arg-56 (15Gustina A.S. Trudeau M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13082-13087Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), strongly regulate deactivation, we propose that both hydrophobic and non-hydrophobic residues located nearby one another make up a putative gating face on the PAS domain (Fig. 7A), which regulates deactivation and inactivation either allosterically or by forming a direct interaction with another part of the channel, perhaps the C-terminal region (30Gustina A.S. Trudeau M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Understanding the molecular defect of each hERG LQT2 channel gives insight into potential mechanisms for restoring WT-like function to mutant channels. To this end, we tested whether a genetically encoded hERG PAS domain (NPAS) (15Gustina A.S. Trudeau M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13082-13087Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was a general tool to rescue hERG PAS-LQT2 channels in HEK293 cells. We found that NPAS specifically slowed and restored aberrant deactivation gating in hERG PAS-LQT2 channels. We also found that NPAS specifically left-shifted and restored steady-state inactivation gating in the mutant channels and also specifically left-shifted and restored the steady-state activation curve of hERG N33T. NPAS also decreased and restored steady-state channel availability in hERG N33T and R56Q (see Fig. 5C). Notably, NPAS fully rescued the defective resurgent current properties of hERG R56Q in response to a dynamic ramp clamp. Our findings demonstrate that NPAS is a general means for rescuing gating-defective hERG LQT2 mutant channels.In a model we propose to explain the rescue of gating properties by NPAS shown here (Fig. 7B), hERG PAS-LQT2 channels exhibit altered deactivation kinetics and steady-state inactivation properties because critical protein interactions between the PAS domain and the channel were disrupted. NPAS physically interacts with the channel and supplants the covalently attached, mutated PAS domain, thus restoring WT-like deactivation kinetics and steady-state inactivation properties. Recently, the notion of using biological alternatives, such as gene therapy, as treatment options for arrhythmogenic diseases like LQT2 was explored (31Cho H.C. Marbán E. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 674-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our findings show that NPAS is a useful tool for rescuing gating-deficient mutant hERG channels, and we propose that NPAS may be a potential biological therapeutic for LQT2. In this study, we investigated hERG channels bearing LQT2 mutations in the PAS domain (hERG PAS-LQT2) in a mammalian expression system. Our findings demonstrated that hERG PAS-LQT2 channels exhibited a spectrum of biochemical and functional defects (summarized in Table 2).

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13082-13087Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), strongly regulate deactivation, we propose that both hydrophobic and non-hydrophobic residues located nearby one another make up a putative gating face on the PAS domain (Fig. 7A), which regulates deactivation and inactivation either allosterically or by forming a direct interaction with another part of the channel, perhaps the C-terminal region (30Gustina A.S. Trudeau M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular defect of each hERG LQT2 channel gives insight into potential mechanisms for restoring WT-like function to mutant channels. To this end, we tested whether a genetically encoded hERG PAS domain (NPAS) (15Gustina A.S. Trudeau M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13082-13087Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was a general tool to rescue hERG PAS-LQT2 channels in HEK293 cells. We found that NPAS specifically slowed and restored aberrant deactivation gating in hERG PAS-LQT2 channels. We also found that NPAS specifically left-shifted and restored steady-state inactivation gating in the mutant channels and also specifically left-shifted and restored the steady-state activation curve of hERG N33T. NPAS also decreased and restored steady-state channel availability in hERG N33T and R56Q (see Fig. 5C). Notably, NPAS fully rescued the defective resurgent current properties of hERG R56Q in response to a dynamic ramp clamp. Our findings demonstrate that NPAS is a general means for rescuing gating-defective hERG LQT2 mutant channels. In a model we propose to explain the rescue of gating properties by NPAS shown here (Fig. 7B), hERG PAS-LQT2 channels exhibit altered deactivation kinetics and steady-state inactivation properties because critical protein interactions between the PAS domain and the channel were disrupted. NPAS physically interacts with the channel and supplants the covalently attached, mutated PAS domain, thus restoring WT-like deactivation kinetics and steady-state inactivation properties. Recently, the notion of using biological alternatives, such as gene therapy, as treatment options for arrhythmogenic diseases like LQT2 was explored (31Cho H.C. Marbán E. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 674-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our findings show that NPAS is a useful tool for rescuing gating-deficient mutant hERG channels, and we propose that NPAS may be a potential biological therapeutic for LQT2. We thank Dr. M. Sanguinetti for the hERG PAS-LQT2 cDNAs, Dr. G. Robertson for the anti-hERG-KA antibody, Dr. H. Misono for technical assistance, and Dr. A. Meredith, Dr. J. Montgomery, and A.

https://openalex.org/W1988242404,"In blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), assessing functional connectivity between and within brain networks from datasets acquired during steady-state conditions has become increasingly common. However, in contrast to connectivity analyses based on task-evoked signal changes, selecting the optimal spatial location of the regions of interest (ROIs) whose timecourses will be extracted and used in subsequent analyses is not straightforward. Moreover, it is also unknown how different choices of the precise anatomical locations within given brain regions influence the estimates of functional connectivity under steady-state conditions. The objective of the present study was to assess the variability in estimates of functional connectivity induced by different anatomical choices of ROI locations for a given brain network. We here targeted the default mode network (DMN) sampled during both resting-state and a continuous verbal 2-back working memory task to compare four different methods to extract ROIs in terms of ROI features (spatial overlap, spatial functional heterogeneity), signal features (signal distribution, mean, variance, correlation) as well as strength of functional connectivity as a function of condition. We show that, while different ROI selection methods produced quantitatively different results, all tested ROI selection methods agreed on the final conclusion that functional connectivity within the DMN decreased during the continuous working memory task compared to rest."
https://openalex.org/W2019165787,"Warburg effect is a hallmark of cancer manifested by continuous prevalence of glycolysis and dysregulation of oxidative metabolism. Glycolysis provides survival advantage to cancer cells. To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying the Warburg effect, we first compared oxygen consumption among hFOB osteoblasts, benign osteosarcoma cells, Saos2, and aggressive osteosarcoma cells, 143B. We demonstrate that, as both proliferation and invasiveness increase in osteosarcoma, cells utilize significantly less oxygen. We proceeded to evaluate mitochondrial morphology and function. Electron microscopy showed that in 143B cells, mitochondria are enlarged and increase in number. Quantitative PCR revealed an increase in mtDNA in 143B cells when compared with hFOB and Saos2 cells. Gene expression studies showed that mitochondrial single-strand DNA-binding protein (mtSSB), a key catalyst of mitochondrial replication, was significantly up-regulated in 143B cells. In addition, increased levels of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes were accompanied by significant reduction of their activities. These changes indicate hyperactive mitochondrial replication in 143B cells. Forced overexpression of mtSSB in Saos2 cells caused an increase in mtDNA and a decrease in oxygen consumption. In contrast, knockdown of mtSSB in 143B cells was accompanied by a decrease in mtDNA, increase in oxygen consumption, and retardation of cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In summary, we have found that mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells correlates with abnormally increased mitochondrial replication, which according to our gain- and loss-of-function experiments, may be due to overexpression of mtSSB. Our study provides insight into mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer and may offer potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2034240642,"Phenotypic anomalies are common in wild populations and multiple genetic, biotic and abiotic factors might contribute to their formation. Turtles are excellent models for the study of developmental instability because anomalies are easily detected in the form of malformations, additions, or reductions in the number of scutes or scales.In this study, we integrated field observations, manipulative experiments, and climatic and genetic approaches to investigate the origin of carapace scute anomalies across Iberian populations of the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis. The proportion of anomalous individuals varied from 3% to 69% in local populations, with increasing frequency of anomalies in northern regions. We found no significant effect of climatic and soil moisture, or climatic temperature on the occurrence of anomalies. However, lower genetic diversity and inbreeding were good predictors of the prevalence of scute anomalies among populations. Both decreasing genetic diversity and increasing proportion of anomalous individuals in northern parts of the Iberian distribution may be linked to recolonization events from the Southern Pleistocene refugium.Overall, our results suggest that developmental instability in turtle carapace formation might be caused, at least in part, by genetic factors, although the influence of environmental factors affecting the developmental stability of turtle carapace cannot be ruled out. Further studies of the effects of environmental factors, pollutants and heritability of anomalies would be useful to better understand the complex origin of anomalies in natural populations."
https://openalex.org/W2122523542,"Data from clinical studies, cell culture, and animal models implicate the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)/uPA receptor (uPAR)/plasminogen system in the development of atherosclerosis and aneurysms. However, the mechanisms through which uPA/uPAR/plasminogen stimulate these diseases are not yet defined. We used genetically modified, atherosclerosis-prone mice, including mice with macrophage-specific uPA overexpression and mice genetically deficient in uPAR to elucidate mechanisms of uPA/uPAR/plasminogen-accelerated atherosclerosis and aneurysm formation. We found that macrophage-specific uPA overexpression accelerates atherosclerosis and causes aortic root dilation in fat-fed Ldlr(-/-) mice (as we previously reported in Apoe(-/-) mice). Macrophage-expressed uPA accelerates atherosclerosis by stimulation of lesion progression rather than initiation and causes disproportionate lipid accumulation in early lesions. uPA-accelerated atherosclerosis and aortic dilation are largely, if not completely, independent of uPAR. In the absence of uPA overexpression, however, uPAR contributes modestly to both atherosclerosis and aortic dilation. Microarray studies identified S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA as the most highly up-regulated transcripts in uPA-overexpressing macrophages; up-regulation of S100A9 protein in uPA-overexpressing macrophages was confirmed by Western blotting. S100A8/A9, which are atherogenic in mice and are expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques, are also up-regulated in the aortae of mice with uPA-overexpressing macrophages, and macrophage S100A9 mRNA is up-regulated by exposure of wild-type macrophages to medium from uPA-overexpressing macrophages. Macrophage microarray data suggest significant effects of uPA overexpression on cell migration and cell-matrix interactions. Our results confirm in a second animal model that macrophage-expressed uPA stimulates atherosclerosis and aortic dilation. They also reveal uPAR independence of these actions and implicate specific pathways in uPA/Plg-accelerated atherosclerosis and aneurysmal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2117436358,"Epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) activity is regulated, in part, by the cortical cytoskeleton. Here we demonstrate that cortactin is highly expressed in the kidney cortex and polarized epithelial cells, and is localized to the cortical collecting duct. Coexpression of cortactin with ENaC decreases ENaC activity, as measured in patch-clamp experiments. Biotinylation experiments and single-channel analysis reveal that cortactin decreases ENaC activity via affecting channel open probability (P(o)). Knockdown of cortactin in mpkCCD(c14) principal cells results in an increase in ENaC activity and sodium reabsorption. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis shows direct interactions between cortactin and all three ENaC subunits in cultured and native cells. To address the question of what mechanism underlies the action of cortactin on ENaC activity, we assayed the effects of various mutants of cortactin. The data show that only a cortactin mutant unable to bind Arp2/3 complex does not influence ENaC activity. Furthermore, inhibitor of the Arp2/3 complex CK-0944666 precludes the effect of cortactin. Depolymerization of the actin microfilaments and inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex does not result in the loss of association between ENaC and cortactin. Thus, these results indicate that cortactin is functionally important for ENaC activity and that Arp2/3 complex is involved in this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1966909775,"Trafficking of the proteins that form gap junctions (connexins) from the site of synthesis to the junctional domain appears to require cytoskeletal delivery mechanisms. Although many cell types exhibit specific delivery of connexins to polarized cell sites, such as connexin32 (Cx32) gap junctions specifically localized to basolateral membrane domains of hepatocytes, the precise roles of actin- and tubulin-based systems remain unclear. We have observed fluorescently tagged Cx32 trafficking linearly at speeds averaging 0.25 μm/s in a polarized hepatocyte cell line (WIF-B9), which is abolished by 50 μm of the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole. To explore the involvement of cytoskeletal components in the delivery of connexins, we have used a preparation of isolated Cx32-containing vesicles from rat hepatocytes and assayed their ATP-driven motility along stabilized rhodamine-labeled microtubules in vitro. These assays revealed the presence of Cx32 and kinesin motor proteins in the same vesicles. The addition of 50 μm ATP stimulated vesicle motility along linear microtubule tracks with velocities of 0.4–0.5 μm/s, which was inhibited with 1 mm of the kinesin inhibitor AMP-PNP (adenylyl-imidodiphosphate) and by anti-kinesin antibody but only minimally affected by 5 μm vanadate, a dynein inhibitor, or by anti-dynein antibody.

IntroductionGap junction channels form direct intercellular passageways that allow the exchange of ions and second messenger molecules between cells, thereby spreading signals and unifying cellular responses within a tissue. Gap junctions are formed by the connexin family of proteins that are co-translationally inserted into endoplasmic reticulum membranes (1Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and assembled into hexameric connexons or hemichannels within the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi compartments depending on connexin, cell type, or both (2Musil L.S.

Connexins are tetra-spanning transmembrane proteins with both termini (N termini and C termini) facing the cytoplasm. This conformation results in two extracellular loops required for connexon docking and one cytoplasmic loop.Knowing the mechanisms of delivery is crucial to understanding connexin regulation because insertion into the plasma membrane is a prerequisite to connexin function. The route of delivery of connexons from the trans-Golgi to the surface membrane has been the subject of many studies, most recently focusing on exogenously expressed connexins with carboxyl-terminally tagged fluorescent proteins. These studies have indicated that the vesicular structures in which connexins are delivered to the surface occur in a variety of sizes and are motile. Moreover, although delivery appears to be facilitated by microtubules, intact cytoskeleton is not absolutely required for trafficking, as evidenced by the variable effects reported for microtubule-disrupting agents (7Paulson A.F.

Nevertheless, intracellular transport of connexins with fluorescent tags, exogenously expressed in cells, appears to be following linear and oriented movements, consistent with targeted delivery via cytoskeletal elements (8Lauf U.

However, the role that microtubules and microtubule motors play in delivery of connexin proteins has not being studied in detail and remains undefined. In this study, we have made similar observations with a variant GFP-tagged Cx32 2The abbreviations used are: Cx32connexin32AMP-PNPadenylyl-imidodiphosphate. construct exogenously expressed in a polarized hepatocyte cell model and furthermore observed that microtubule disruption abolishes particle motility. We, therefore, hypothesize that microtubule and microtubule motors play a role in delivery of connexins, more specifically Cx32, to the plasma membrane.To gain insight into the fundamental mechanisms involved in gap junction trafficking to the surface membrane, we have explored microtubule involvement in a simplified system in which in vitro polymerized-microtubules were studded with Cx32-containing vesicles isolated from rat liver, a rich source of this gap junction protein, which are immunofluorescently labeled. When stimulated by the addition of ATP, a fraction of these vesicles moved along the microtubules, with velocities similar to those seen in exogenously expressing cells. Moreover, based on findings that certain motor proteins are present in these vesicles as well as the inhibition of vesicular motility by kinesin motor protein inhibitors, we conclude that kinesin plays a major role in trafficking of the connexin vesicles along the microtubules. We interpret these results as indicative of microtubule and microtubule-kinesin motor-dependent trafficking of Cx32, which presumably occurs in cells expressing Cx32, such as hepatocytes in liver and in myelinating glia (Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes) in the peripheral and central nervous system, and highlighting another checkpoint in the regulation of Cx32 function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESUnless otherwise noted, all reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.Cx32-mEmerald ConstructThe enhanced GFP (EGFP) derivative Emerald (emGFP, EGFP + S72A/N149K/M153T,I167T, Invitrogen) was converted to the A206K variant using the Lightning mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and the resulting cDNA was amplified with a 5′ primer encoding an AgeI site and a 3′ primer encoding a NotI site. The purified and digested PCR products were ligated into a similarly digested EGFP-N1 cloning vector (Clontech) operating under CMV control. To prepare the Cx32 fusion, a CMV-Clontech vector containing enhanced YFP (EYFP) fused to human β-1 connexin32 with a 7-amino acid linker (ADPPVAT) and the mEmerald-N1 cloning vector were digested with BamHI and NotI. After purification, the PCR products were ligated to produce Cx32-7-mEmerald.Vector DNA for transfection was prepared using the plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). To ensure proper localization, Cx32-7-mEmerald was characterized by transfection in HeLa cells (CCL2 line; ATCC, Manassas, VA) using Effectene (Qiagen) and ∼1 μg of vector. Transfected cells were grown on coverslips in DMEM/F12, fixed after 48 h, and mounted with Gelvatol. Epifluorescence images were captured with a Nikon 80i microscope using wide field illumination and a FITC filter set, showing proper localization in gap junction plaques using Cx32-7-EGFP as a control (not shown).Culture and Transfection of WIF-B9 CellsWIF-B9 cells, a hepatoma-human fibroblast fusion cell line that forms functional bile canaliculi, were kindly obtained at passage p4 from Dr. Anne Muesch (Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY). Cells were maintained in culture in a humid environment with 5% CO2 at 37 °C using F12 medium supplemented with sodium bicarbonate, 1% GlutaMAX, 5% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.2% Fungizone. Freshly split cells (within 2 h after splitting) were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid containing human full-length Cx32-mEmerald using Lipofectamine LTX + Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were resuspended using serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) medium instead of regular growth medium and plated in culture dishes with glass bottoms for imaging (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA; P35G-1.5-14-C), and then DNA-Lipofectamine complexes were added to the culture. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and then medium was changed, and cells were assayed for protein expression and imaging 48 h later. WIF-B9 cells were placed in a 10-min 10 °C preincubation and treated at 37 °C with 50 μm nocodazole for 1.5 h prior to imaging at 28 °C to determine the effects of microtubule disruption Cx32-mEmerald vesicle motility.AntibodiesAnti-Cx32 mouse monoclonal (C6344) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (generated against cytoplasmic loop and C termini cytoplasmic domains of Cx32) were obtained from Sigma (polyclonal antibodies C3595 and C3470, respectively). Kinesin (90 and 120 KDa) heavy chain antibodies generated against the conserved globular N-terminal head were purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO; and rabbit polyclonal AKIN01 and mouse monoclonal AKIN02/SUK4), and a mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Millipore Corp. (Billerica, MA; clone H2: MAB1614). Mouse monoclonal anti-kinesin light chain antibody was purchased from Millipore (MAB1616). Other antibodies used include mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Sigma, G8795), anti-Cx26 goat polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab59020), anti-Lamp1 mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam, ab13523), mouse monoclonal anti-dynein light chain (Millipore, MAB1076), mouse monoclonal anti-Rab4 (BD Biosciences; 610888), rabbit monoclonal anti-EEA1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA; 2411S), goat polyclonal anti-clathrin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; sc-6579), mouse monoclonal anti-synaptophysin (Sigma S5768), and mouse monoclonal anti-β/α-tubulin (Sigma, T6074 and T0198, respectively). Secondary polyclonal antibodies Alexa Fluor 488/594-conjugated goat anti-mouse or -rabbit from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen) were used for indirect immunofluorescence (488 nm mouse/rabbit, A-11001/A-11008; 594 nm mus/rab, A-11005/A-11012, respectively; and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated rabbit anti-goat, A-21223). For indirect immunodetection of Western blotted proteins, we used HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and -rabbit secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2005/sc-2004, respectively).Isolation of Cytoplasmic Membrane VesiclesThe protocol used to isolate vesicles from liver has been published (16Murray J.W. Bananis E. Wolkoff A.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 419-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sprague-Dawley rats were i.v. injected with 50 μg of Texas Red-labeled asialoorosomucoid for 5 min, to label early endosomes, and then the animals were perfused with 30 ml of ice-cold PBS. Livers were removed from the animal, washed with PBS and then MEPS (35 mm Pipes, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.2 m sucrose), diced with a razor blade, and added to 15 ml of MEPS plus protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340). The mix was homogenized with 20 strokes using a loose Dounce (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ), and the resulting lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm (1,811 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant was then removed and supplemented with DTT and protease inhibitor mixture. The postnuclear supernatant was applied to a Sephacryl S200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in MEPS, and the void volume containing the endosomes was applied to the bottom of a 0.25/1.2/1.4 m discontinuous sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged for 135 min at 39,000 rpm, at 4 °C. Approximately 1.2 ml was collected from the 0.25/1.2 m interface and aliquoted for storage at −80 °C or liquid nitrogen. Samples were measured for protein content using the BCA kit from Pierce (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For immunostaining of vesicles, endosome isolation was obtained from rats as described above but without the injection of labeled asialoorosomucoid.Western BlottingLysate collection for tissues and vesicles was similar. For tissues, mice were deeply sedated and operated to expose the heart and liver and then perfused with cold PBS through the left ventricle until the liver and heart were blanched. The tissues were then removed and placed in ice-cold PBS for two rounds of gentle washing and then transferred to a 60-mm dish with 5 ml of Lysis Buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). The tissues were minced with a sharp, clean blade and passed through a cloth mesh, and the collection was then spun at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed and placed in a new Eppendorf tube, and a 10-μl sample was used for protein quantification using a BCA kit (Pierce 23225). The remaining was supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8340) and 1 mm PMSF. A 100-μl sample was saved for whole lysate Western blotting; the remainder was either used immediately or separated into aliquots for storage at −80 °C. It should be noted that these samples were all normalized with respect to total protein, and thus, band intensity directly reflects the relative amount of each protein in the total lysate.Samples were processed by electrophoresis in 10% Tris-based SDS-denaturing polyacrylamide gels using 55-V and 35-mA currents for 1.5–2 h and then trans-blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane at 300 mA (∼80 V) for 1 h in a 4 °C cold room. The membrane was left overnight with 3% skim milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) complemented with 0.05% Tween 20 detergent (Western blot blocking solution) followed by incubation with dilution of 1:500–1000 of primary antibody in Western blot blocking solution overnight at 4 °C or 2 h at room temperature. After incubation, the membrane was washed 3 × 5 min in Western blot wash solution (TBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with 1:5000–20,000 HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in Western blot blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane was washed 5 × 5 min, and HRP signal was developed with the Amersham Biosciences ECL kit (GE Healthcare Ltd.). The membrane was then photoprinted onto a Kodak film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a dark room. It should be noted that a band was observed when using primary monoclonal antibodies in both tissue and vesicle samples, which was determined to originate from the anti-mouse secondary antibody (see supplemental Fig. 1 and its legend).ImmunoprecipitationAn antibody-Sepharose bead complex was prepared at 4 °C 16 h in advance, where 1 μg of polyclonal Cx32 or 2 μg of monoclonal kinesin antibody was preincubated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and 500 μl of Lysis Buffer. The mix was spun at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing unbound antibody was removed. Separately, liver lysate was dissolved in Lysis Buffer until a 1 mg/ml concentration was obtained, and then the lysate was precleared by adding 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G-Sepharose beads and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The tubes were then spun at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to precipitate the beads. Usually, this was performed two times. 500 μl of supernatant was then carefully removed onto the tube containing the antibody-bead mix, which had been supplemented with 10 μl of 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block unspecific binding to the complex. The lysate-antibody-bead mix was then left rotating at 4 °C for 4 h. The samples were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed. The beads were then washed with 1 ml of Wash Buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), gently resuspended by tapping the Eppendorf tube, and spun once again. The washes were repeated twice. In the final step, all the supernatant was removed, and denaturing Loading Buffer was added to proceed with Western blotting, as above.Micro-chambersThe construction of the micro-chambers for microtubule and vesicle motility experiments was minimally modified from Murray et al. (17Murray J.W. Bananis E. Wolkoff A.W. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using a commercial (Toyo) glass cutter, a plain glass microscope slide was cut transversely to a measure of 1.5 × 0.7 cm. The piece was washed once or twice in ethanol and then in distilled water to remove dust and grease and left to air-dry. Briefly, a 50-ml Falcon conical tube was cut in half around the 30-ml mark. The piece with the lid was inverted and filled with DEAE-dextran (final 20 μg/ml; from 150× stock) in distilled water. The other half was placed on a Styrofoam holder and filled with ethanol (70%). The same procedure was applied to an oblong cover glass (22 × 40 mm No. 1, Gold Seal, Thermo Scientific). After light air-drying, the cover glass was dipped completely into the DEAE-dextran cuvette 8–10 times, then rinsed thoroughly with distilled water using a nozzle. The cover glass was air-dried again and then placed on a clean surface. Two strips of double-sided Scotch adhesive tape were cut, about 1.2 × 0.4 cm, and placed on the cover glass parallel to its long axis, leaving a 0.5–1-cm space. Finally, the cut glass slide piece was lowered on top perpendicular to the Scotch tape and pressed firmly to seal the adhesive tape, providing a micro-chamber with a working volume of 7–15 μl.Immunostaining of Vesicles in Micro-chambersThe micro-chamber surface was washed twice with 100 μl of “Assay Buffer” (35 mm Pipes, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT, 20 μm Taxol, 2 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4) by adding it in one end of the opening and gently absorbing the liquid at the other end with a folded KimWipe tissue. Vesicles were diluted into Assay Buffer (to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml), and 4 μl was added to the chamber and incubated at room temperature for 10 min in a humid chamber. The unbound vesicles were rinsed away with 3 × 15-μl washes of Block Buffer (Assay Buffer + 5 mg/ml casein) and then incubated with 1:100–500 diluted primary antibody. Block Buffer was added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature in a humid chamber. This was followed by 3 × 15-μl washes with Block Buffer, and 1:500–1000 diluted secondary antibody added for 5 min at room temperature in a humid chamber. The last wash of 3 × 15 μl was left with Antibleach Buffer (Assay Buffer supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 52 units/ml catalase or horseradish peroxidase, and 26 units/ml glucose oxidase). The micro-chamber was then sealed with nail polish on both sides to avoid evaporation.Fluorescent MicrotubulesPolymerized microtubules were constructed as previously published (16Murray J.W. Bananis E. Wolkoff A.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 419-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Unlabeled tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc., TL238, 250 g) was dissolved in 25 μl of Buffer 1 (80 mm Pipes-K2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and 3% glycerol). 12 μl of unlabeled tubulin was added to anhydrous rhodamine-labeled tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc., TL331M, 20 μg), and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a 4 °C cold centrifuge. 6 μl of unlabeled/labeled tubulin solution (11.7 μg/μl) was mixed with an additional 4 μl of unlabeled tubulin to a total of 10 μl. 7 μl of 37 °C warm Buffer 1 was added to 10 μl of the tubulin mix. The mixture was warmed to 37 °C for 8–15 min until the desired polymerization was reached (several tubes were made to determine the ideal microtubule length). The microtubules were stabilized by adding 190 μl of warm Buffer 1 supplemented with 20 μm Paclitaxel (Taxol) (Sigma, T7402). Centrifugation was then performed in a Beckman Airfuge apparatus (Beckman Coulter, Inc) at 15 p.s.i. for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer 1 + 20 μm Paclitaxel. This preparation was used within 2 weeks and maintained at room temperature, wrapped in aluminum foil. A dilution of 1/50 was used to coat micro-chambers with microtubules.Vesicle MotilityExperiments were performed following a previously published protocol (16Murray J.W. Bananis E. Wolkoff A.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 419-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Diluted microtubules (1/50) in Buffer 1 supplemented with 20 μm Paclitaxel were added to a micro-chamber in 3 × 15-μl perfusions, with the last volume left in place for 3 min at room temperature. The micro-chamber was then washed three times with 12 μl of Buffer 1 without glycerol but with 10 μm Paclitaxel added and then three times with 12 μl of PMEE Buffer (35 mm Pipes-K2, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 μm Paclitaxel, 4 mm DTT and 2 mg/ml BSA) supplemented with 5 mg/ml casein. The chamber was then washed three times with 12 μl of PMEE Buffer. Aliquots of vesicles were perfused into the microtubule-coated chambers 3 × 4 μl, and the last was maintained for 10 min followed by washing with PMEE Buffer. Chambers were then perfused with diluted primary antibodies in PMEE Buffer containing 5 mg/ml casein and without DTT, for 6 min at room temperature and then blocked with PMEE Buffer with casein and without DTT and perfused with diluted secondary antibody for 5 min. The secondary antibody was washed twice with PMEE Buffer supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 2% glucose oxidase, 2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase, and 2 mg/ml vitamin C. The chamber was refrigerated in an ice box until use (no more than 2 h). Anti-motor antibodies were incubated after secondary antibody wash for 6 min at room temperature at 1:50 dilutions. When anti-motor antibodies were used, a different host primary antibody was chosen against Cx32. For motility imaging, 20 μl of PMEE Buffer freshly supplemented with 50 μm ATP was perfused through the chamber and imaged under epifluorescent microscopy in a 37 °C chamber.Imaging and Data AnalysisTime-lapse microscopy of Cx32-transfected WIF-B9 cells were performed on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with appropriate filters for 488 nm excitation and band-pass filter 505–550 nm for emission capture. Dishes containing transfected cells were placed in conditioned chambers at 28 °C and imaged no longer than 30 min. Time-lapse images were obtained at 1–5-s intervals for 5–15 min using a 63× oil immersion objective with 1.4 numerical aperture (NA) and 2× zoom, keeping the 100 milliwatt 488 nm laser power between 1 and 3%, and high scan speed to avoid cell damage. Three z-plane slices, of 0.34- or 0.7-μm separation, were obtained for each time point to avoid losing vesicles that drifted from the plane of view; this resulted in xyzt dimensional stacks. Images were captured using the LSM software. Images were then analyzed using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Time-lapse microscopy of micro-chambers was performed with an Olympus 1 × 71 microscope in a conditioned chamber at 37 °C with a 60 × 1.4 NA objective and automated excitation and emission filter sets for fluorescence capture. Data were recorded with a CoolSNAP HQ cooled CCD (Photometrics, Roper Scientific, Tucson AZ) controlled by the MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).To track Cx32-mEmerald vesicles, xyzt stacks were z-projected using the maximum pixel intensity value to obtain xyt stacks, and vesicles were tracked using the ImageJ manual tracking plugin. Distance displacements and calculated speed values were transferred to the Microsoft Excel program (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) for further analysis. Vesicle speeds were calculated from the distance/time measurements, excluding stationary dwell times. In the text, average values are accompanied by standard error of the mean (S.E.) values, considering the different sizes of samples. To obtain time- and color-coded (t) images (see Fig. 1, A and B), we applied the Z-Code Stack plugin from ImageJ to the xyt stacks to spectrum-code all images in the stack, with red images at time 0, through green, to violet at the end of the recording. The time color-coded xyt stacks were then Z-projected using maximum intensity to compact all time points and obtain an xy time- and color-coded image. For immunolabeled Cx32-containing vesicles on fluorescent microtubules, images obtained were of one-plane, xyt format. Images were exported from MetaMorph and analyzed as mentioned above using ImageJ. In color-coded images, colored spots represent motile vesicles, whereas white spots represent near static vesicles.Displacement graphs were obtained by obtaining the cumulative displacement for each particle at each time point (using the SUM function in Excel). Motility profile images in Fig. 4B were obtained for the time-lapsed dual-colored image in Fig. 4A by tracing a line over microtubules using ImageJ and then using the Stacks > Reslice function to obtain kymographs for motile vesicles.FIGURE 4Micro-chamber motility assays show ATP-dependent motility of Cx32-stained vesicles on fluorescently labeled microtubules. Rhodamine-labeled microtubules were added to glass micro-chambers (see under “Experimental Procedures”) followed by rat liver vesicle isolate and then indirectly fluorescently labeled with rabbit polyclonal anti-Cx32 antibody. A, an example of one experiment where 10 out of 94 vesicles were motile. Vesicle motility was recorded at 37 °C, before and after perfusion of 50 μm ATP. Differential interference contrast (not shown) and fluorescent images were taken at 1 Hz for 60 s. Numbered arrowheads show motile vesicles (see supplemental Movie 3). B, motility profile graph (kymographs) of all 10 numbered vesicles in A, showing the cumulative displacement versus time. Displacement is marked on the y axis, and time is marked on the x axis. The occurrence of “upward” but not “downward” displacement is indicative of unilateral vesicle movement along the microtubule. Note that the time of ATP addition is denoted by a vertical green line. Also note that some vesicles start later, pause more, or stop moving (horizontal line) earlier than others, showing the diverse motile nature of these vesicle. C, plot of cumulative displacement as a function of time obtained from manual tracking of vesicles shown in A. Due to unilateral displacement, these graphs look similar to the kymographs in B.

https://openalex.org/W1984849618,"We employed the Cre recombinase/loxP system to create a mouse line in which PKA activity can be inhibited in any cell-type that expresses Cre recombinase. The mouse line carries a mutant Prkar1a allele encoding a glycine to aspartate substitution at position 324 in the carboxy-terminal cAMP-binding domain (site B). This mutation produces a dominant negative RIα regulatory subunit (RIαB) and leads to inhibition of PKA activity. Insertion of a loxP-flanked neomycin cassette in the intron preceding the site B mutation prevents expression of the mutant RIαB allele until Cre-mediated excision of the cassette occurs. Embryonic stem cells expressing RIαB demonstrated a reduction in PKA activity and inhibition of cAMP-responsive gene expression. Mice expressing RIαB in hepatocytes exhibited reduced PKA activity, normal fasting induced gene expression, and enhanced glucose disposal. Activation of the RIαB allele in vivo provides a novel system for the analysis of PKA function in physiology."
https://openalex.org/W1973146464,"Background Despite the availability of many animal models for tuberculosis (TB) research, there still exists a need for better understanding of the quiescent stage of disease observed in many humans. Here, we explored the use of the Wistar rat model for the study of protective immunity and control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Methodology/Principal Findings The kinetics of bacillary growth, evaluated by the colony stimulating assay (CFU) and the extent of lung pathology in Mtb infected Wistar rats were dependent on the virulence of the strains and the size of the infecting inoculums. Bacillary growth control was associated with induction of T helper type 1 (Th1) activation, the magnitude of which was also Mtb strain and dose dependent. Histopathology analysis of the infected lungs demonstrated the formation of well organized granulomas comprising epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells and foamy macrophages surrounded by large numbers of lymphocytes. The late stage subclinical form of disease was reactivated by immunosuppression leading to increased lung CFU. Conclusion The Wistar rat is a valuable model for better understanding host-pathogen interactions that result in control of Mtb infection and potentially establishment of latent TB. These properties together with the ease of manipulation, relatively low cost and well established use of rats in toxicology and pharmacokinetic analyses make the rat a good animal model for TB drug discovery."

An armadillo-fold in its N terminus mediated a novel interaction between p115 and γ-tubulin and functioned in its centrosomal targeting. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of p115 were required to maintain Golgi structure. Strikingly, p115 was essential for mitotic spindle function and the resolution of the cytokinetic bridge because its depletion resulted in spindle collapse, chromosome missegregation, and failed cytokinesis.

https://openalex.org/W2034946767,"The serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are anti-inflammatory proteins that have various functions. By screening a diverse panel of viruses, we demonstrate that the serpin antithrombin III (ATIII) has a broad-spectrum anti-viral activity for HIV-1, HCV and HSV. To investigate the mechanism of action in more detail we investigated the HIV-1 inhibition. Using gene-expression arrays we found that multiple host cell signal transduction pathways were activated by ATIII in HIV-1 infected cells but not in uninfected controls. Moreover, the signal pathways initiated by ATIII treatment, were more than 200-fold increased by the use of heparin-activated ATIII. The most up-regulated transcript in HIV-1 infected cells was prostaglandin synthetase-2 (PTGS2). Furthermore, we found that over-expression of PTGS2 reduced levels of HIV-1 replication in human PBMC. These findings suggest a central role for serpins in the host innate anti-viral response. Host factors such as PTGS2 elicited by ATIII treatment could be exploited in the development of novel anti-viral interventions."
https://openalex.org/W1987383545,"The mucus that coats the gastrointestinal tract of all mammals is a dynamic and sticky gel layer and represents the first protective barrier between the host and the hostile environment. There is, however, a lack of detailed knowledge about the mucus gel organization because of the high water content and the complexity of MUC2, the main gel-forming molecule in the intestine. Histological staining and a multilabel immunofluorescence method were used to examine mucus blankets and Muc2 in mouse colon and ileum samples fixed in Carnoy's solution, unveiling an extraordinarily complex but highly structured mucus gel organization. The inner firmly adherent mucus blanket consists of alternating layers. The thicker outer loosely adherent mucus blanket in the colon is made of alternating laminated layers and loose curl-like structures. The layers consist of Muc2 molecules with different fucosylation states and glycoforms remain unmixed in the mucus. Importantly, distinct goblet cell subpopulations throughout the ileum along the crypt-to-villus axis with an alternation of goblet cells secreting fucosylated and non-fucosylated Muc2 are observed. A better understanding of the mucus structure should contribute to improve the efficiency of DNA and drug delivery and will allow for a better understanding and treatment of inflammatory and infectious intestinal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2009332510,"The mass spectrometry-based peptidomics approaches have proven its usefulness in several areas such as the discovery of physiologically active peptides or biomarker candidates derived from various biological fluids including blood and cerebrospinal fluid. However, to identify biomarkers that are reproducible and clinically applicable, development of a novel technology, which enables rapid, sensitive, and quantitative analysis using hundreds of clinical specimens, has been eagerly awaited. Here we report an integrative peptidomic approach for identification of lung cancer-specific serum peptide biomarkers. It is based on the one-step effective enrichment of peptidome fractions (molecular weight of 1,000-5,000) with size exclusion chromatography in combination with the precise label-free quantification analysis of nano-LC/MS/MS data set using Expressionist proteome server platform. We applied this method to 92 serum samples well-managed with our SOP (standard operating procedure) (30 healthy controls and 62 lung adenocarcinoma patients), and quantitatively assessed the detected 3,537 peptide signals. Among them, 118 peptides showed significantly altered serum levels between the control and lung cancer groups (p<0.01 and fold change >5.0). Subsequently we identified peptide sequences by MS/MS analysis and further assessed the reproducibility of Expressionist-based quantification results and their diagnostic powers by MRM-based relative-quantification analysis for 96 independently prepared serum samples and found that APOA4 273-283, FIBA 5-16, and LBN 306-313 should be clinically useful biomarkers for both early detection and tumor staging of lung cancer. Our peptidome profiling technology can provide simple, high-throughput, and reliable quantification of a large number of clinical samples, which is applicable for diverse peptidome-targeting biomarker discoveries using any types of biological specimens."
https://openalex.org/W2030253400,"To understand the mechanisms by which 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE) activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), we studied the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 15(S)-HETE stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in a time-dependent manner in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Interference with EGFR activation blocked 15(S)-HETE-induced Src and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and VSMC migration. 15(S)-HETE also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) in VSMCs, and its inhibition substantially reduced STAT3 phosphorylation, MCP-1 expression, and VSMC migration. In addition, Src formed a complex with EGFR and Jak2, and its inhibition completely blocked Jak2 and STAT3 phosphorylation, MCP-1 expression, and VSMC migration. 15(S)-HETE induced the production of H(2)O(2) via an NADPH oxidase-dependent manner and its scavengers, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and catalase suppressed 15(S)-HETE-stimulated EGFR, Src, Jak2, and STAT3 phosphorylation and MCP-1 expression. Balloon injury (BI) induced EGFR, Src, Jak2, and STAT3 phosphorylation, and inhibition of these signaling molecules attenuated BI-induced MCP-1 expression and smooth muscle cell migration from the medial to the luminal surface resulting in reduced neointima formation. In addition, inhibition of EGFR blocked BI-induced Src, Jak2, and STAT3 phosphorylation. Similarly, interference with Src activation suppressed BI-induced Jak2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated expression of dnJak2 also blocked BI-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Consistent with the effects of 15(S)-HETE on the activation of EGFR-Src-Jak2-STAT3 signaling in VSMCs in vitro, adenovirus-mediated expression of 15-lipoxygenase 1 (15-Lox1) enhanced BI-induced EGFR, Src, Jak2, and STAT3 phosphorylation leading to enhanced MCP-1 expression in vivo. Blockade of Src or Jak2 suppressed BI-induced 15-Lox1-enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation, MCP-1 expression, and neointima formation. In addition, whereas dominant negative Src blocked BI-induced 15-Lox1-enhanced Jak2 phosphorylation, dnJak2 had no effect on Src phosphorylation. Together, these observations demonstrate for the first time that the 15-Lox1-15(S)-HETE axis activates EGFR via redox-sensitive manner, which in turn mediates Src-Jak2-STAT3-dependent MCP-1 expression leading to vascular wall remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2009066864,"Associations between specific host genes and susceptibility to Mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis have been reported in several species. Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) impacts greatly the UK cattle industry, yet genetic predispositions have yet to be identified. We therefore used a candidate gene approach to study 384 cattle of which 160 had reacted positively to an antigenic skin test ('reactors'). Our approach was unusual in that it used microsatellite markers, embraced high breed diversity and focused particularly on detecting genes showing heterozygote advantage, a mode of action often overlooked in SNP-based studies. A panel of neutral markers was used to control for population substructure and using a general linear model-based approach we were also able to control for age. We found that substructure was surprisingly weak and identified two genomic regions that were strongly associated with reactor status, identified by markers INRA111 and BMS2753. In general the strength of association detected tended to vary depending on whether age was included in the model. At INRA111 a single genotype appears strongly protective with an overall odds ratio of 2.2, the effect being consistent across nine diverse breeds. Our results suggest that breeding strategies could be devised that would appreciably increase genetic resistance of cattle to bTB (strictly, reduce the frequency of incidence of reactors) with implications for the current debate concerning badger-culling."

Selfish or negligent reviewers reduce the effectiveness of submitting more proposals, but have less influence as available funding declines. Policies designed to decrease proposal submissions reduce reviewer workload, but can lower the quality of funded proposals.

https://openalex.org/W2029234954,"All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces growth arrest of many cell types. Previous studies have reported that ATRA can modulate cellular sphingolipids, but the role of sphingolipids in the ATRA response is not clear. Using MCF-7 cells as a model system, we show that ATRA stimulates an increase in ceramide levels followed by G(0)/G(1) growth arrest. Notably, induction of nSMase2 was the primary effect of ATRA on the sphingolipid network and was both time- and dose-dependent. Importantly, pretreatment with nSMase2 siRNA significantly inhibited ATRA effects on ceramide levels and growth arrest. In contrast, nSMase2 overexpression was sufficient to increase ceramide levels and induce G(0)/G(1) growth arrest of asynchronous MCF-7 cells. Surprisingly, neither ATRA stimulation nor nSMase2 overexpression had significant effects on classical cell cycle regulators such as p21/WAF1 or retinoblastoma. In contrast, ATRA suppressed phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and its downstream targets S6 and eIF4B. Importantly, these effects were significantly inhibited by nSMase2 siRNA. Reciprocally, nSMase2 overexpression was sufficient to suppress S6K phosphorylation and signaling. Notably, neither ATRA effects nor nSMase2 effects on S6K phosphorylation required the ceramide-activated protein phosphatase PP2A, previously identified as important for S6K regulation. Finally, nSMase2 overexpression was sufficient to decrease translation as measured by methionine incorporation and analysis of polyribosome profiles. Taken together, these results implicate nSMase2 as a major component of ATRA-induced growth arrest of MCF-7 cells and identify S6K as a novel downstream target of nSMase2."
https://openalex.org/W1996908854,"The three neurexins genes (NRXN1/2/3) encode polymorphic synaptic membrane proteins that are involved in cognitive functioning. Neurexins' selectivity of function is presumably conferred through differential use of 2 promoters and 5 alternative splicing sites (SS#1/2/3/4/5). In day-old rat brain neurons grown in culture, activation (depolarization) induces reversible, calcium dependent, repression of NRXN2α SS#3 insert. The effects of depolarization on NRXN1/2/3α splicing and biochemical pathways mediating them were further studied in these neurons. NRXN1/2/3α splicing in the course of memory formation in vivo was also explored, using fear conditioning paradigm in rats in which the animals were trained to associate an aversive stimulus (electrical shock) with a neutral context (a tone), resulting in the expression of fear responses to the neutral context.In the cultured neurons depolarization induced, beside NRXN2α SS#3, repression of SS#3 and SS#4 exons in NRXN3α but not NRXN1α. The repressions were mediated by the calcium/protein kinase C/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway. Fear conditioning induced significant and transient repressions of the NRXN1/2/3α SS#4 exons in the rat hippocampus. ROCK inhibition prior to training attenuated the behavioral fear response, the NRXN1/2/3α splicing repressions and subsequent recovery and the levels of excitatory (PSD95) and inhibitory (gephyrin) synaptic proteins in the hippocampus. No such effects were observed in the prefrontal cortex. Significant correlations existed between the fear response and hippocampal NRXN3α and NRXN2α SS#4 inserts as well as PSD95 protein levels. Hippocampal NRXN1α SS#4 insert and gephyrin levels did not correlate with the behavioral response but were negatively correlated with each other.These results show for the first time dynamic, experience related changes in NRXN1/2/3α alternative splicing in the rat brain and a role for ROCK in them. Specific neurexins' transcripts may be involved in synaptic remodeling occurring at an intermediate (hours) time scale in the course of memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W1992977120,"Background The Weberian apparatus of otophysine fishes facilitates sound transmission from the swimbladder to the inner ear to increase hearing sensitivity. It has been of great interest to biologists since the 19th century. No studies, however, are available on the development of the Weberian ossicles and its effect on the development of hearing in catfishes. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the development of the Weberian apparatus and auditory sensitivity in the catfish Lophiobagrus cyclurus. Specimens from 11.3 mm to 85.5 mm in standard length were studied. Morphology was assessed using sectioning, histology, and X-ray computed tomography, along with 3D reconstruction. Hearing thresholds were measured utilizing the auditory evoked potentials recording technique. Weberian ossicles and interossicular ligaments were fully developed in all stages investigated except in the smallest size group. In the smallest catfish, the intercalarium and the interossicular ligaments were still missing and the tripus was not yet fully developed. Smallest juveniles revealed lowest auditory sensitivity and were unable to detect frequencies higher than 2 or 3 kHz; sensitivity increased in larger specimens by up to 40 dB, and frequency detection up to 6 kHz. In the size groups capable of perceiving frequencies up to 6 kHz, larger individuals had better hearing abilities at low frequencies (0.05–2 kHz), whereas smaller individuals showed better hearing at the highest frequencies (4–6 kHz). Conclusions/Significance Our data indicate that the ability of otophysine fish to detect sounds at low levels and high frequencies largely depends on the development of the Weberian apparatus. A significant increase in auditory sensitivity was observed as soon as all Weberian ossicles and interossicular ligaments are present and the chain for transmitting sounds from the swimbladder to the inner ear is complete. This contrasts with findings in another otophysine, the zebrafish, where no threshold changes have been observed."
https://openalex.org/W2019478752,"Background Despite access to effective, safe, and affordable treatment for osteoporosis, at-risk women may choose not to start bisphosphonate therapy. Understanding the reasons women give for rejecting a clinician's offer of treatment during consultations and how clinician's react to these reasons may help clinicians develop more effective strategies for fracture prevention and medication adherence. Methods We conducted a videographic evaluation of encounters in the Osteoporosis Choice randomized trial of a decision aid about bisphosphonates vs. usual primary care. Eligible videos involved consultations with women with an estimated 10-year fragility fracture risk >20% who verbalized at least one reason to not take bisphosphonates. Two reviewers independently reviewed eligible videos and verbatim transcripts, classifying patient views about bisphosphonate use, clinicians reponse to those views, and patient adherence at 6 months post visit. Results Eighteen video recordings (12 with decision aid) were eligible for analyses. We identified 37 reasons for and against bisphosphonate therapy. Eleven patients rejected treatment, offering 9 (average of 2 per patient) unique reasons against initiating bisphosphonates (most common: side effects 39% and distrust of medications in general 33%). When physicians conceded to patient views the outcome was no bisphosphonate use. Adherence to choices at 6 months was 100%. Conclusions The expression of patient preferences is sometimes unfavorable to bisphosphonates treatment even among well-informed patients at high risk for osteoporotic fractures. At 6 months, patients who expressed concerns about these medicines behaved consistently with the decision made during the visit."
https://openalex.org/W2023547565,"In view of understanding the mechanisms of retinal neovascularization, we had reported previously that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced pathological retinal angiogenesis requires the activation of Src-PLD1-PKCγ signaling. In the present work, we have identified cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) as an effector molecule of Src-PLD1-PKCγ signaling in the mediation of VEGF-induced pathological retinal angiogenesis based on the following observations. VEGF induced cPLA2 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMVECs). VEGF also induced arachidonic acid (AA) release in a dose-, time-, and cPLA2-dependent manner. Depletion of cPLA2 levels inhibited VEGF-induced HRMVEC DNA synthesis, migration, and tube formation. In addition, the exogenous addition of AA rescued VEGF-induced HRMVEC DNA synthesis, migration, and tube formation from inhibition by down-regulation of cPLA2. Inhibition of Src, PLD1, or PKCγ attenuated VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation and AA release. Consistent with these findings, hypoxia induced cPLA2 phosphorylation and activity in VEGF-Src-PLD1-PKCγ-dependent manner in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. In addition, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of cPLA2 levels in the retina abrogated hypoxia-induced retinal endothelial cell proliferation and neovascularization.

In addition, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of cPLA2 levels in the retina abrogated hypoxia-induced retinal endothelial cell proliferation and neovascularization. These observations suggest that cPLA2-dependent AA release is required for VEGF-induced Src-PLD1-PKCγ-mediated pathological retinal angiogenesis. Ischemic retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and retinopathy of prematurity often lead to retinal neovascularization (1Gariano R.F. Gardner T.W.

Because ω-6 PUFA influence angiogenesis and PLA2 play a rate-limiting role in AA release, we asked the question whether the cPLA2-AA axis plays a role in VEGF-induced pathological retinal angiogenesis. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find the role of cPLA2 in pathological retinal angiogenesis and its spatial relationship to Src-PLD1-PKCγ signaling. Our studies revealed that VEGF activates cPLA2 downstream of Src, PLD1, and PKCγ in HRMVECs. In addition, Src-PLD1-PKCγ-dependent cPLA2 activation and AA release are required for VEGF-induced HRMVEC DNA synthesis, migration, and tube formation. Interestingly enough, Src-PLD1-PKCγ-cPLA2 activation is also needed for hypoxia-induced VEGF-mediated pathological retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of OIR.

HRMVECs (catalogue No. ACBRI 181) were purchased from the Applied Cell Biology Research Institute (Kirkland, WA) and grown in Medium 131 containing microvascular growth supplements, 10 μg/ml gentamycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. HRMVECs with passage numbers between 5 and 10 were growth-arrested by incubating them in Medium 131 for 12 h and used to perform the experiments unless otherwise indicated. [3H]AA release from HRMVECs prelabeled with [3H]AA (0.5 μCi/ml) was measured as described previously and expressed as counts/min/dish (31Rao G.N. Lassègue B. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cell migration was measured using a modified Boyden chamber method as described previously (29Cheranov S.Y. Karpurapu M. Wang D. Zhang B. Venema R.C. Rao G.N. Blood. 2008; 111: 5581-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the values are expressed as number of migrated cells/field. cPLA2 activity in the retinal extracts was measured using a kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemicals). Briefly, 10 μl of the retinal extracts containing an equal amount of protein was mixed with 5 μl of 10 μm bromoenol lactone followed by the addition of 200 μl of 1.5 m substrate (arachidonyl thio-phosphatidylcholine) and incubation at room temperature for 60 min. Reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm in a Spectramax 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA). Assays were performed in triplicate, and cPLA2 activity was calculated using the extinction coefficient value of 12.8 mm−1 cm−1 for 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The cPLA2 activity was expressed as nanomol of substrate hydrolyzed/min/ml. DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously and expressed as counts/min/dish (32Karpurapu M. Wang D. Singh N.K. Li Q. Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26577-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Tube formation was measured as described previously (29Cheranov S.Y. Karpurapu M. Wang D. Zhang B. Venema R.C. Rao G.N. Blood. 2008; 111: 5581-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The tube-like structures were observed under a phase contrast light microscope (Nikon Eclipse TS100, type ADL; magnification ×10/NA 0.25), and the images were captured by a charge-coupled device camera (KP-D20AU, Hitachi) using Apple iMovie 7.1.4 software. The tube length, calculated using NIH ImageJ version 1.43, was expressed in micrometers. Cell or tissue extracts containing an equal amount of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking in either 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk or 5% (w/v) BSA, the membrane was probed with the appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). HRMVECs were transfected with scrambled or target gene siRNA molecules at a final concentration of 100 nm using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. When adenoviral vectors were used to deliver the dominant negative mutant of a specific gene, cells were infected with adenovirus carrying GFP or target gene at 40 multiplicities of infection overnight in complete medium. After transfections or infections, cells were growth-arrested in microvascular growth supplement-free Medium 131 for 24 h and used as required. In the case of transfections in vivo, siRNA molecules at 1 μg/0.5 μl/eye were injected intravitreally using a 33-gauge needled syringe. All experiments involving the use of animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN. Retinal angiogenesis was performed according to the method of Connor et al. (33Connor K.M. Krah N.M. Dennison R.J. Aderman C.M. Chen J. Guerin K.I. Sapieha P. Stahl A. Willett K.L. Smith L.E. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 1565-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). C57BL/6J mice pups (P7) with nursing mothers were exposed to 75% oxygen for 5 days and then returned to room air at P12. Mice pups of the same age kept at room air were used as controls. After exposure to hyperoxia, mice pups were administered scrambled siRNA, cPLA2 siRNA or VEGF siRNA (1 μg/0.5 μl/eye) at P13, P14, and P15 by intravitreal injections using a 33-gauge needle. The mice pups were sacrificed at P17 after intracardiac perfusion with high molecular weight FITC-dextran in PBS. Eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 6 to 24 h at room temperature. Retinas were isolated, flat-mounted, placed under a coverslip, examined under a Zeiss inverted fluorescence microscope (AxioVision AX10), and quantified using Nikon NIS-Elements software version AR 3.1. Retinal vasculature was determined by calculating the ratio of fluorescence intensity to total retinal area. Retinal tufts and/or counting proliferating ECs were used to evaluate the retinal neovascularization. Neovascularization was quantified either by dividing the tufts area by the total retinal area or counting the CD31- and Ki67-positive cells that extended anterior to the inner limiting membrane per section (n = 3 eyes, 5 sections/eye). After hyperoxia, mice pups were returned to room air for 3 days, at which time they were sacrificed, eyes were enucleated and fixed in OCT compound, and cryosections were prepared. To detect the phosphorylation of cPLA2 in the retina, after blocking in normal goat serum, the cryosections (5 μm) were probed with rabbit anti-human phospho-cPLA2 (Ser-505) antibodies (1:100) and rat anti-mouse CD31 antibodies (1:100) in a humidified chamber for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated-goat anti-rat secondary antibodies. Normal serum from rabbit and/or rat was used as a control. To identify proliferating ECs, after blocking in normal goat serum, the cryosections were probed with rabbit anti-mouse Ki67 antibodies (1:100) and rat anti-mouse CD31 antibodies (1:100) followed by incubation with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibodies. The sections were observed under a Zeiss inverted microscope (Zeiss AxioVision AX10; type LD plan-Neofluar, magnification ×40/NA 0.6; or type plan-Apochromat, magnification ×10/NA 0.45), and the fluorescence images were captured by a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera using the microscope-operating and image analysis software AxioVision 4.7.2 (Carl Zeiss Imaging Solutions GmbH). All of the experiments were repeated three times, and data are presented as mean ± S.D. The treatment effects were analyzed by Student's t test, and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In the case of Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and retinal angiogenesis, one set of data is presented. Recent studies have suggested that PUFA such as AA play a role in the regulation of angiogenesis (27Szymczak M. Murray M. Petrovic N. Blood. 2008; 111: 3514-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Connor K.M. SanGiovanni J.P. Lofqvist C. Aderman C.M. Chen J. Higuchi A. Hong S. Pravda E.A. Majchrzak S. Carper D. Hellstrom A. Kang J.X. Chew E.Y. Salem Jr., N. Serhan C.N. Smith L.E. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Because cPLA2 hydrolyzes glycerophospholipids with AA at the sn-2 position, we hypothesized that cPLA2-dependent AA release is required for pathological retinal angiogenesis. To address this hypothesis, we tested the effect of VEGF on cPLA2 activation and AA release in HRMVECs. VEGF stimulated cPLA2 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner in HRMVECs (Fig. 1A). VEGF also induced AA release in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HRMVECs (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, siRNA-mediated depletion of cPLA2 levels abolished VEGF-induced AA release (Fig. 1D). Similarly, siRNA-mediated depletion of cPLA2 levels inhibited VEGF-induced HRMVEC DNA synthesis, migration, and tube formation (Fig. 2, A, B, and C). If activation of cPLA2 is sufficient to mediate VEGF-induced HRMVEC angiogenic responses, then exogenous addition of AA should be able to rescue VEGF-induced HRMVEC DNA synthesis, migration, and tube formation from inhibition by cPLA2 depletion. Indeed, the exogenous addition of AA rescued VEGF-induced HRMVEC DNA synthesis, migration, and tube formation from inhibition by siRNA-mediated cPLA2 down-regulation (Fig. 2, A, B, and C).FIGURE 2AA rescues HRMVEC DNA synthesis, migration, and tube formation from inhibition by cPLA2 down-regulation. A–C, HRMVECs that were transfected with scrambled or cPLA2 siRNA (100 nm) and growth-arrested were treated with and without VEGF (40 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of exogenously added AA (10 μm), and DNA synthesis (A), migration (B), and tube formation (C) were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The bar graphs in A–C represent the quantitative analysis of three independent experiments.

PP1, a potent and specific inhibitor of Src (35Yeh M. Gharavi N.M. Choi J. Hsieh X. Reed E. Mouillesseaux K.P. Cole A.L. Reddy S.T. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30175-30181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) attenuated VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). To confirm this observation, we blocked Src activation via adenovirus-mediated expression of its dominant negative mutant (dnSrc) and tested its effect on VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation. Adenovirus-mediated expression of dnSrc diminished VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Both PP1 and dnSrc blocked VEGF-induced AA release (Fig. 3, C and D). These observations indicate that Src mediates VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation and AA release. As we had previously shown that Src mediates VEGF-induced PLD1 activation (19Zhang Q. Wang D. Kundumani-Sridharan V. Gadiparthi L. Johnson D.A. Tigyi G.J. Rao G.N. Blood. 2010; 116: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), next we wanted to find whether PLD1 plays a role in VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation. 1-Butanol, a potent and specific inhibitor of PLD1 (36Banno Y. Takuwa Y. Akao Y. Okamoto H. Osawa Y. Naganawa T. Nakashima S. Suh P.G. Nozawa Y. J. Biol.

In addition, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of PLD1 levels blocked VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). Consistent with these observations, either PLD1 inhibition by 1-butanol or its down-regulation by siRNA diminished VEGF-induced AA release (Fig. 4, B and D). Together, these results suggest that PLD1 is required for VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation and AA release. The PKC family of serine/threonine kinases includes several members that are classified as conventional (α, β, and γ), novel (δ, ∈, η and θ), or atypical (ζ, ι, and μ) (37Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we had reported that VEGF stimulates PKCγ downstream of Src-PLD1 in HRMVECs (19Zhang Q. Wang D. Kundumani-Sridharan V. Gadiparthi L. Johnson D.A. Tigyi G.J. Rao G.N. Blood. 2010; 116: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to find whether PKCγ also plays a role in VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation and AA release. To test this assumption, PKCγ was down-regulated using its siRNA and tested for its effect on VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation and AA release. Down-regulation of PKCγ levels by its siRNA attenuated VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation and AA release (Fig. 5, A and B). Together, these observations show that VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation and AA release require activation of Src-PLD1-PKCγ signaling. Previous studies had demonstrated that MAPKs play a role in agonist-induced cPLA2 activation (38Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 39Suram S. Gangelhoff T.A. Taylor P.R. Rosas M. Brown G.D. Bonventre J.V. Akira S. Uematsu S. Williams D.L. Murphy R.C. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 30676-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, to find whether MAPKs play a role in VEGF-induced cPLA2 activation, we also studied the role of ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38MAPK. VEGF induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38MAPK in a time-dependent manner in HRMVECs (Fig. 5C). However, a blockade of ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38MAPK by adenovirus-mediated expression of dnMEK1 (dnMEK1 blocks ERK1/2 phosphorylation), dnJNK1, and dnp38MAPK, respectively, had no significant effect on VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D). The above findings clearly indicated a role for cPLA2-mediated AA release in VEGF-induced HRMVEC DNA synthesis, migration, and tube formation. To validate these in vitro observations in vivo, we used a mouse model of OIR. After exposure to hyperoxia from P7 to P12, the mice pups were returned to normoxia to create a relative hypoxia. At various time periods of hypoxia, retinal extracts were prepared and analyzed for cPLA2 phosphorylation. Subjecting mice pups to hypoxia caused an increase in the phosphorylation of cPLA2 with the maximum effect at day 3 (Fig. 6A). To find whether hypoxia-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation requires VEGF, VEGF levels were down-regulated by injecting its siRNA into the vitreous humor at P12 and P13, and cPLA2 phosphorylation in the retina was measured at day 3 (P15) of hypoxia. VEGF down-regulation significantly attenuated hypoxia-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). Because the in vitro observations showed that VEGF-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation requires activation of Src-PLD1-PKCγ, we next tested the role of this signaling axis in hypoxia-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation. Depletion of Src, PLD1, and PKCγ levels by their respective siRNAs attenuated hypoxia-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6, C–E). In addition, whereas down-regulation of Src levels attenuated both PLD1 and PKCγ phosphorylation (Fig. 6C), depletion of PLD1 levels blocked only PKCγ phosphorylation (Fig. 6D). Consistent with the role of VEGF-Src-PLD1-PKCγ signaling in hypoxia-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation, siRNA-mediated depletion of these molecules also decreased cPLA2 activity (Fig. 6F). As expected, down-regulation of cPLA2 levels by its siRNA attenuated hypoxia-induced cPLA2 activity as well (Fig. 6, F and G). Thus, these results indicate that hypoxia-induced cPLA2 activation requires VEGF-Src-PLD1-PKCγ signaling. To find the cell type in which hypoxia-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation occurs, mice pups at day 3 of hypoxia were sacrificed and enucleated, retinas were isolated and fixed, and sections were prepared and subjected to double immunofluorescence staining for CD31 and phospho-cPLA2. Substantial increases in the phosphorylation of cPLA2 were observed mostly i"
https://openalex.org/W2005270731,"The amount of available hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α has been considered to be largely a consequence of post-translational modification by multiple ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. However, the role of transcriptional regulation of HIF-1α is less certain, and the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of HIF-1α require further investigation. Here we report that related transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (RTEF-1), a member of the TEF transcriptional factor family, transcriptionally regulates the HIF-1α gene under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The expression of HIF-1α mRNA was decreased in endothelial cells in which RTEF-1 was knocked down with siRNA. Sequential deletional analysis of the HIF-1α promoter revealed that the MCAT-like element in the HIF-1α promoter was essential for HIF-1α transcription. Binding of RTEF-1 to the MCAT-like element was confirmed by ChIP. Treatment of endothelial cells with a HIF-1 inhibitor resulted in retardation of RTEF-1-induced proliferation and tube formation. Moreover, increased HIF-1α expression was observed in transgenic mice expressing RTEF-1 under the VE-cadherin promoter (VE-Cad/RTEF-1). VE-Cad/RTEF-1 mice subjected to hindlimb ischemia demonstrated increased levels of HIF-1α, accelerated recovery of blood flow, and increased capillary density compared with littermate controls. These results identify RTEF-1 as a regulator of HIF-1α transcription, which results in up-regulation of HIF-1α and acceleration of recovery from ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2040238490,"Notch3 signaling is fundamental for arterial specification of systemic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, the developmental role and signaling properties of the Notch3 receptor in the mouse pulmonary artery remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Notch3 is expressed selectively in pulmonary artery VSMCs, is activated from late fetal to early postnatal life, and is required to maintain the morphological characteristics and smooth muscle gene expression profile of the pulmonary artery after birth. Using a conditional knock-out mouse model, we show that Notch3 receptor activation in VSMCs is Jagged1-dependent. In vitro VSMC lentivirus-mediated Jagged1 knockdown, confocal localization analysis, and co-culture experiments revealed that Notch3 activation is cell-autonomous and occurs through the physical engagement of Notch3 and VSMC-derived Jagged1 in the interior of the same cell. Although the current models of mammalian Notch signaling involve a two-cell system composed of a signal-receiving cell that expresses a Notch receptor on its surface and a neighboring signal-sending cell that provides membrane-bound activating ligand, our data suggest that pulmonary artery VSMC Notch3 activation is cell-autonomous. This unique mechanism of Notch activation may play an important role in the maturation of the pulmonary artery during the transition to air breathing."
https://openalex.org/W2061629381,"Cdc7 is a serine/threonine kinase conserved from yeasts to human and is known to play a key role in the regulation of initiation at each replication origin. Its catalytic function is activated via association with the activation subunit Dbf4/activator of S phase kinase (ASK). It is known that two conserved motifs of Dbf4/ASK are involved in binding to Cdc7, and both are required for maximum activation of Cdc7 kinase. Cdc7 kinases possess unique kinase insert sequences (kinase insert I–III) that are inserted at defined locations among the conserved kinase domains. However, precise mechanisms of Cdc7 kinase activation are largely unknown. We have identified two segments on Cdc7, DAM-1 (Dbf4/ASK interacting motif-1; amino acids 448–457 near the N terminus of kinase insert III) and DAM-2 (C-terminal 10-amino acid segment), that interact with motif-M and motif-C of ASK, respectively, and are essential for kinase activation by ASK. The C-terminal 143-amino acid polypeptide (432–574) containing DAM-1 and DAM-2 can interact with Dbf4/ASK. Characterization of the purified ASK-free Cdc7 and Cdc7-ASK complex shows that ATP binding of the Cdc7 catalytic subunit requires Dbf4/ASK. However, the “minimum” Cdc7, lacking the entire kinase insert II and half of kinase insert III, binds to ATP and shows autophosphorylation activity in the absence of ASK. However, ASK is still required for phosphorylation of exogenous substrates by the minimum Cdc7.

MCM is the key substrate of Cdc7 during DNA replication. Cdc7 is required throughout the S phase for activation of each replication origin (29Bousset K. Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 30Donaldson A.D. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J.

Hence, Cdc7 may play crucial roles in determining where and when DNA replication should be initiated in the eukaryotic genomes (2Masai H. Matsumoto S. You Z. Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Oda M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 89-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Cdc7 has been implicated also in various other chromosome transactions, including meiotic recombination (33Ogino K. Hirota K.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1257-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cdc7 may phosphorylate distinct targets in these processes. Thus, understanding the mechanism by which Cdc7 is activated by ASK and recognizes specific substrates would provide important information on how chromosome functions are regulated by Cdc7 kinase. Dbf4-related subunits, conserved from yeasts to human, were shown to contain three conserved motifs, Dbf4-motif-N, -M, and -C (37Masai H. Arai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Both Dbf4-motif-M and -C are capable of binding to Cdc7 on their own, but each alone is not sufficient for full kinase activation (38Ogino K. Takeda T. Matsui E. Iiyama H. Taniyama C. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31376-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Sato N. Sato M. Nakayama M. Saitoh R. Arai K. Masai H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The sequence between motif-M and motif-C is not essential, and its length can be varied without compromising the kinase activation, which leads to a bipartite binding model of ASK (38Ogino K. Takeda T. Matsui E. Iiyama H. Taniyama C. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31376-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In yeast, vegetative growth requires only motif-M (40Fung A.D. Ou J. Bueler S. Brown G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4477-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but the growth through meiosis requires both motif-M and motif-C (38Ogino K. Takeda T. Matsui E. Iiyama H. Taniyama C. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31376-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, motif-N is also required for growth of mouse embryonic stem cells (41Yamashita N. Kim J.M. Koiwai O. Arai K. Masai H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cdc7 kinase consists of 11 kinase domains and two (or three) so-called “kinase insert” sequences unique to this family of kinases (20Masai H. Arai K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Sclafani R.A. Jackson A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 42Masai H. Sato N. Takeda T. Arai K. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D834-D840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase domains are highly conserved through evolution, whereas the amino acid sequences of kinase insert II (amino acids, 275–368) and III (440–538) are more diverse (supplemental Fig. S1; kinase insert I of huCdc7 is very short). It has been reported that sequences within the Cdc7 kinase insert II interact with Importin and facilitate Cdc7 nuclear import (43Kim B.J. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12041-12049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was also reported that nuclear export signals are present in the C-terminal segments (44Kim B.J. Kim S.Y. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30029-30038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, how the two ASKs interact with Cdc7 and how this interaction leads to activation of Cdc7 kinase have been unclear. The findings in this study show that a small segment within the Cdc7 kinase insert III and that near the C terminus of Cdc7, designated as DAM-1 and DAM-2, interact with motif-M and motif-C, respectively, and these bipartite interactions are essential for kinase activation. Furthermore, the 143-amino acid segment of Cdc7 containing these motifs can bind to ASK. We have purified free full-length Cdc7 and the Cdc7-ASK complex expressed in Escherichia coli and showed that Cdc7 in the complex, but not free Cdc7, bound to ATP. Deletion of kinase inserts led to the generation of a “minimum” Cdc7 that can bind to ATP and autophosphorylates in the absence of ASK. However, ASK is still required for efficient phosphorylation of exogenous substrates by the minimum Cdc7. These results lead us to conclude that ASK facilitates both ATP binding to the catalytic subunit and recognition of specific substrates. HeLa and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hana-Nesco Bio). muCdc7(−/−) ES cells were maintained in DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen, 11995-065) containing 20% FBS (Invitrogen, 16141-079), 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen 11140-050), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen, 20530-081), 1% nucleotide mixture (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, R-ES-008D), 0.07% β-mercaptoethanol (Nacalai 214-38), and 103 units/ml ESGRO (Chemicon, ESG1107). Phosphospecific antibodies recognizing phosphorylated S53 (A300-756A) and S41/42 (A300-788A) of MCM2 were from Bethyl Laboratories. The phosphospecific antibody, S6T7 (MCM4), was described before (31Masai H. Taniyama C. Ogino K. Matsui E. Kakusho N. Matsumoto S. Kim J.M. Ishii A. Tanaka T. Kobayashi T. Tamai K. Ohtani K. Arai K.

Anti-ASK antibody was made against an ASK polypeptide (305–357 amino acids) in rabbit. pME18S-HA vector was generated by inserting DNA sequences derived from the oligonucleotides (XhoI-HA-NotI-F 5′-TCG AGA TGT ACC CAT ACG ATG TTC CAG ATT ACG CTG C-3′ and XhoI-HA-NotI-R 5′-GGC CGC AGC GTA ATC TGG AAC ATC GTA TGG GTA CAT C-3′) encoding influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag between the XhoI and NotI sites of pME18S plasmid. The pME18S-HA-Cdc7 was constructed by cloning a cDNA encoding full-length human Cdc7 into the NotI and SpeI sites of pME18S-HA. A series of Cdc7 deletion mutants were generated by using Phusion® site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs), as recommended by the supplier. Each construct was verified by nucleotide sequencing. The pCSII-EF-mKO2-HA-Cdc7 plasmid was generated by subcloning the HA-Cdc7 insert (XhoI-SpeI fragment) from pME18S-HA-Cdc7 plasmid into the CSII-EF-MCS vector at the XhoI-XbaI site. The pME18S-FLAG-ASK plasmid was generated as described previously (41Yamashita N. Kim J.M. Koiwai O. Arai K. Masai H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Either Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) was used for transfection into HeLa cells, and TransIT293 (Mirus) or polyethyleneimine (“MAX” reagent) solution (56Uno S. Masai H. Genes Cells. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) was used for transfection into 293T cells. Cells were harvested at 30 h after transfection, and protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Asynchronously growing muCdc7(−/−)tg ES cells (45Kim J.M. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Saito I. Katsuki M. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were infected by Ade-Cre (100 multiplicity of infection) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Then pCSII-EF-mKO2-HA-Cdc7-derived plasmids expressing various forms of huCdc7 were transiently transfected into the cells by using FuGENE HD. Four days after transfection, growth recovery of transfected cells was examined under fluorescence microscopy. Cells were resuspended in CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES-KOH, (pH 6.8), 100 mm potassium glutamate, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm ATP, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 0.1% Triton X-100). After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 × g in a bench-top centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered. The anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone 16B12, Covance) or the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) was conjugated with Dynabeads protein G (Dynal) at room temperature for 40 min with rotation. The extract was incubated with antibody-conjugated beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads, washed four times with cold CSK buffer, were resuspended in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis or washed once with 1× kinase buffer (40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) and used in the in vitro kinase assay. For expression of Cdc7T5-ASK, the “minimum” Cdc7 sequence harboring amino acid residues 27–221, 371–486, and 537–574 was subcloned into the BamHI/SalI sites of the first multicloning site of modified pETDuet-1 (Novagen) with a His6 tag at the N terminus. The minimal ASKs, including residues 171–350, were subcloned into NdeI/XhoI sites of the second multicloning site. For expression of Cdc7T5 alone, the PCR product for Cdc7T5 was digested with BamHI/XhoI and inserted into pET21b. The recombinant plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain (Novagen). The expression of Cdc7T5 or Cdc7T5-ASK was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 = 0.45–0.7. Following incubation at 17 °C for 12 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). The cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 45 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap HP column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole, and Cdc7 T5 proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The proteins were treated with tobacco etch virus protease for 12 h at 4 °C to cleave the His6 tag and further purified by the heparin HP column (Amersham Biosciences). The heparin fractions were reloaded onto HisTrap HP column (Amersham Biosciences), and flow-through fractions were collected. The proteins were finally polished through a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 2 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol. Fractions containing the Cdc7 T5 alone were collected and concentrated to 12 mg/ml using 10,000 nominal molecular weight limit (NMWL) device (Centricon). These fractions were further purified by the Mono S column, and activity was confirmed to comigrate with the T5 polypeptide (data not shown). Because there was no difference in activity between the Centricon-concentrated fraction and Mono S-purified fraction, we used the former fraction for our assays. The full-length Cdc7 cDNA tagged with His6-tobacco etch virus protease site at the N terminus was subcloned at NdeI-XhoI sites of pETDuet, generating pETDuet-Cdc7 expressing His-tagged Cdc7T1. DNA fragment containing the minimal ASK was subcloned at NcoI-NotI sites of pETDuet-Cdc7 to express His-tagged Cdc7T1-ASK. Cdc7T1 and T1-ASK were expressed in BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RP strain and were purified by using Qiagen nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose in buffer A containing 40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After the column was washed with buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, protein was eluted with buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. The peak fractions were further purified by a Mono Q column using SMART system. The protein was eluted with 0–1 m KCl gradient, and eluted fractions were dialyzed against buffer A. Standard in vitro kinase assay for Cdc7 (46Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol.

Mouse MCM2-4-6-7 complex (0.1–0.5 μg) was used as substrate. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min prior to loading onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE (59:1). The proteins were visualized with either silver or Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. GST-Cdc7-ASK complex, used as a control, was purified from insect cells, as described before (46Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A series of Cdc7 mutants carrying a termination codon TAG at various amino acid residues were generated by using Phusion® site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs), as recommended by the supplier. Each of the Cdc7 mutants (HA-tagged) and full-length human ASK coding frame were inserted at two separate cloning sites in the pETDuet vector (Novagen) for co-expression. p-Benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa, Bachem) was used as photocross-link amino acid. BL21 (DE3), transformed with pSup-BpaRS-6TRN (47Ryu Y. Schultz P.G. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and pETDuet-Cdc7Bpa mutant-ASK, was grown, and the two proteins were co-induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 20 h at 20 °C in the presence of 1 mm Bpa. The whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. The successful cross-linking of the two proteins gives rise to a polypeptide with higher molecular mass, the identity of which can be verified by co-reactivity with anti-HA and anti-ASK antibodies. Proteins were mixed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 125 nm ATP, 9% glycerol with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (in 20 μl). The reaction mixtures placed on a parafilm (on ice) were UV-irradiated using a hand UV lamp for the times indicated. Reaction was terminated by adding 0.8 μl of 100 mm ATP and SDS sample buffer. The reaction mixtures were run on SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and autoradiographed. We previously reported that the activation subunits of human and yeast interact with Cdc7 through their conserved segments, Dbf4-motif-M and Dbf4-motif-C (37Masai H. Arai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 38Ogino K. Takeda T. Matsui E. Iiyama H. Taniyama C. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol.

Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, it is not known which segment of Cdc7 interacts with the Dbf4-related activation subunit. To determine the human Cdc7 segments involved in interaction with ASK, Cdc7 and its deletion derivatives were expressed in the CSII-EF-mKO2 vector plasmid, generating huCdc7-derived polypeptides tagged with mKO2 (monomeric Kusabira Orange 2) and HA (Fig. 1). These plasmids were transiently co-transfected into 293T cells or HeLa cells together with FLAG-tagged ASK plasmid. Extracts were prepared, and immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody was conducted. In addition to the wild-type Cdc7, several mutant Cdc7 polypeptides (Δ201–303(d3), Δ304–336(d4), Δ478–497(d8), and Δ497–525(d9)) were coimmunoprecipitated (supplemental Fig. S2 and data not shown; Table 1). All the mutants containing a deletion spanning the kinase domain (Δ1–100(d1), Δ101–200(d2), Δ337–438(d5), Δ525–544(d10), and Δ545–564(d11)) could not bind to ASK under the conditions employed, potentially due to the loss of conformational integrity. Two kinase insert III mutants (Δ438–456(d6) and Δ458–477(d7)) and a C-terminal tail mutant (Δ565–574(d12)) only inefficiently co-precipitated with ASK (d6) or did not co-precipitate with ASK (d7 and d12). These deletions are located outside the kinase domains and are less likely to induce a large conformational change. These results indicate that a portion of the kinase insert III and the C-terminal tail sequences are specifically required for binding to ASK. Some of the Cdc7 mutants that do not bind to ASK (Δ1–100(d1), Δ101–200(d2), Δ337–438(d5), Δ438–456(d6), Δ458–477(d7), and Δ525–544(d10)) were less stable than those binding to ASK. The ASK protein level also decreased when co-expressed with some of these mutants, suggesting that the complex formation may stabilize both proteins.TABLE 1Summary of deletion derivatives of human Cdc7 kinaseName of the Cdc7 deletionLocation of deletionASK bindingKinase activityMobility shift of ASKIn vitro phosphorylation of MCMD11–100−−−D2101–200−−−D3201–303(KI-II)+++D4304–336(KI-II)+++D5337–438−−−D6438–456(KI-III)+/−−−D7458–477(KI-III)−−−D8478–497(KI-III)+++D9497–525(KI-III)+++D10525–544−−−D11545–564−−−D12565–574(C-ter)−−−Full length−+++ Open table in a new tab We next examined the kinase activities of Cdc7 mutant proteins. The active Cdc7-ASK complex autophosphorylates both subunits, resulting in the mobility shift of ASK subunits on SDS-PAGE primarily due to phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine and threonine-rich tail segment (39Sato N. Sato M. Nakayama M. Saitoh R. Arai K. Masai H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 53Hughes S. Jenkins V. Dar M.J. Engelman A. Cherepanov P. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 541-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is likely to occur in an intramolecular manner, because dilution of Cdc7-ASK did not affect the level of phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. S3). We used this mobility shift as an indicator for the kinase activity. FLAG-ASK and mKO2-HA-Cdc7 mutant proteins were transiently co-expressed in HeLa cells, and Triton-soluble extracts were analyzed by Western blotting. The Cdc7 mutants (Δ201–303(d3), Δ304–336(d4), Δ478–497(d8), and Δ497–525(d9)) induced phosphorylation of ASK, whereas the Cdc7 mutants (Δ1–100(d1), Δ101–200(d2), Δ337–438(d5), Δ438–456(d6), Δ458–477(d7), Δ525–544(d10), Δ545–564(d11), and Δ565–574(d12)) did not induce mobility shift of ASK, suggesting that they are not active kinases or deficient in autophosphorylation of the ASK C terminus. The latter eight mutants did not efficiently interact with ASK, consistent with the fact that complex formation is essential for Cdc7 kinase activation. To measure Cdc7 kinase activity more precisely, we examined the kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated Cdc7-ASK from HeLa cells transiently co-expressing FLAG-ASK and mKO2-HA-Cdc7 mutant on the MCM2-4-6-7 complex in vitro. The results indicate that the same set of the mutants (Δ201–303(d3), Δ304–336(d4), Δ478–497(d8), and Δ497–525(d9)) supports the phosphorylation of MCM2 (Table 1). These results are basically consistent with those of the autophosphorylation assays, indicating that the N-terminal half of the kinase insert III and the very C-terminal segment (Δ565–574) are required for binding to ASK and activation of the kinase.

https://openalex.org/W2062505303,"Human <i>ether-a-go-go</i>-related gene product (HERG) is a cardiac potassium channel commonly implicated in the pathogenesis of the long QT syndrome, type 2 (LQT2). LQT2 mutations typically have incomplete penetrance and affect individuals at various stages of their lives; this may mirror variations in intracellular signaling and HERG regulation. Previous work showed that sustained protein kinase A (PKA) activity augments HERG protein abundance by a mechanism that includes enhanced protein translation. To investigate the subcellular site of this regulation, we generated site-specific probes to the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the presumed locale of channel synthesis. Real-time FRET-based indicators demonstrated both cAMP and PKA activity at the ER. A PKA inhibitor targeted to the ER surface (termed p4PKIg) completely abolished PKA-mediated augmentation of HERG in HEK293 cells as well as rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Immunofluorescence co-localization, targeted FRET-based PKA biosensors, phospho-specific antibodies, and <i>in vivo</i> phosphorylation experiments confirmed that p4PKIg is preferentially active at the ER surface rather than the plasma membrane. Rerouting this inhibitor to the outer mitochondrial membrane diminishes its ability to block cAMP-dependent HERG induction. Our results support a model where PKA-dependent regulation of HERG synthesis occurs at the ER surface. Furthermore, reagents generated for this study provide novel experimental tools to probe compartmentalized cAMP/PKA signaling within cells."

This study aimed to define efficient and safe tissue-selective targeted gene therapy approaches for delivering genes into keratocytes of the cornea in vivo using a normal or diseased rabbit model. New Zealand White rabbits, adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5), and a minimally invasive hair-dryer based vector-delivery technique were used. Fifty microliters of AAV5 titer (6.5×1012 vg/ml) expressing green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) was topically applied onto normal or diseased (fibrotic or neovascularized) rabbit corneas for 2-minutes with a custom vector-delivery technique. Corneal fibrosis and neovascularization in rabbit eyes were induced with photorefractive keratectomy using excimer laser and VEGF (630 ng) using micropocket assay, respectively. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy and immunocytochemistry were used to confirm fibrosis and neovascularization in rabbit corneas. The levels, location and duration of delivered-GFP gene expression in the rabbit stroma were measured with immunocytochemistry and/or western blotting. Slot-blot measured delivered-GFP gene copy number. Confocal microscopy performed in whole-mounts of cornea and thick corneal sections determined geometric and spatial localization of delivered-GFP in three-dimensional arrangement. AAV5 toxicity and safety were evaluated with clinical eye exam, stereomicroscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and H&E staining. A single 2-minute AAV5 topical application via custom delivery-technique efficiently and selectively transduced keratocytes in the anterior stroma of normal and diseased rabbit corneas as evident from immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. Transgene expression was first detected at day 3, peaked at day 7, and was maintained up to 16 weeks (longest tested time point). Clinical and slit-lamp eye examination in live rabbits and H&E staining did not reveal any significant changes between AAV5-treated and untreated control corneas. These findings suggest that defined gene therapy approaches are safe for delivering genes into keratocytes in vivo and has potential for treating corneal disorders in human patients."
https://openalex.org/W2062648117,"Cathelicidins are small cationic antimicrobial peptides found in many species including primates, mammals, marsupials, birds and even more primitive vertebrates, such as the hagfish. Some animals encode multiple cathelicidins in their genome, whereas others have only one. This report identifies and characterizes feline cathelicidin (feCath) as the sole cathelicidin in domestic cats (Felis catus). Expression of feCath is predominantly found in the bone marrow, with lower levels of expression in the gastrointestinal tract and skin. By immunocytochemistry, feCath localizes to the cytoplasm of neutrophils in feline peripheral blood. Structurally, the mature feCath sequence is most similar to a subgroup of cathelicidins that form linear α-helices. feCath possesses antimicrobial activity against E. coli D31, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (IR715), Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (clinical isolate) similar to that of the human ortholog, LL-37. In contrast, feCath lacks the DNA binding activity seen with LL-37. Given its similarity in sequence, structure, tissue expression, and antimicrobial activity, the cathelicidin encoded by cats, feCath, belongs to the subgroup of linear cathelicidins found not only in humans, but also non-human primates, dogs, mice, and rats."
https://openalex.org/W1978759169,"Increasing evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. SEL1L is an ER membrane protein that is highly expressed in the pancreatic islet and acinar cells. We have recently reported that a deficiency of SEL1L causes systemic ER stress and leads to embryonic lethality in mice. Here we show that mice with one functional allele of Sel1l (Sel1l+/−) are more susceptible to high fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperglycemia. Sel1l+/− mice have a markedly reduced β-cell mass as a result of decreased β-cell proliferation. Consequently, Sel1l+/− mice are severely glucose-intolerant and exhibit significantly retarded glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Pancreatic islets from Sel1l+/− mice stimulated with a high concentration of glucose in vitro express significantly higher levels of unfolded protein response genes than those from wild-type control mice. Furthermore, dominant-negative interference of SEL1L function in insulinoma cell lines severely impairs, whereas overexpression of SEL1L efficiently improves protein secretion. Taken together, our results indicate that haploid insufficiency of SEL1L predispose mice to high fat diet-induced hyperglycemia.

The ER is a specialized organelle where nearly all secreted and membrane proteins undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, folding, and multimeric protein complex assembling (7Voeltz G.K. Rolls M.M. Rapoport T.A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 8English A.R. Zurek N. Voeltz G.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Properly folded/assembled proteins travel through the secretory pathway and reach various cellular destinations, whereas nonnative or unassembled proteins are retained in the ER lumen and eventually retrotranslocated into the cytosol for degradation by the proteasomal system (9Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Disequilibrium of ER protein load and folding capacity results in accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, leading to ER stress (10Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 827-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In response to ER stress, cells activate at least three intracellular signal transduction pathways, cumulatively referred to as the unfolded protein response (11Sundar Rajan S. Srinivasan V. Balasubramanyam M. Tatu U. Indian J. Med. Res. 2007; 125: 411-424PubMed Google Scholar). The unfolded protein response, coordinated by three distinct ER stress signal transducers, PERK, IRE1a, and ATF6 (12Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar), result in a general attenuation of protein translation (13Harding H.P. Novoa I. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Urano F. Jousse C. Ron D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Consequently, there is a reduced production of proteins that enter the ER, and there is an increase in the capacity of the ER to handle unfolded proteins. Together, these adaptive measures provide a multifaceted mechanism to maintain ER homeostasis under temporary and reversible ER stress conditions. ER homeostasis is particularly important for the function and viability of professional secretory cells such as the pancreatic β-cell (15Ortsäter H. Sjöholm A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 277: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16van Anken E. Braakman I. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The unique function of the β-cell is to integrate nutrient signals into an appropriate insulin secretory rate to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. In response to serum glucose stimulus, β-cells secrete insulin from a readily available pool while activating proinsulin biosynthesis in the ER (17Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Proinsulin undergoes protein folding and disulfide bond formation in the lumen of the ER (17Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Properly folded proinsulin is then released to the Golgi apparatus and packaged into secretory granules, where conversion of proinsulin into mature insulin takes place (18Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Perrelet A. Vassalli J.D. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2273-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Because of the rapid fluctuation of serum glucose levels in animals, it is essential that β-cells control proinsulin folding in the ER with exquisite sensitivity (19Lipson K.L. Fonseca S.G. Urano F. Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that conditions either evoking an overload of newly synthesized proinsulin or compromising protein folding capacity in the ER may negatively affect the homeostasis of β-cells, leading to ER stress and onset of T2DM (6Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Endocr. Rev. 2008; 29: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, markers of ER stress have been shown to be up-regulated in the islets from T2DM patients (20Boden G. Duan X. Homko C. Molina E.J. Song W. Perez O. Cheung P. Merali S.

Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The physiological role of SEL1L in adult islets remains unclear. Here, we show that mice heterozygous for the gene-trap mutation in Sel1l (Sel1l+/−) are more susceptible to diet-induced hyperglycemia. Sel1l+/− mice are glucose intolerant and have a reduced β-cell mass. Cultured islets from Sel1l+/− mice show significantly higher expression of unfolded protein response marker genes than wild-type control islets. Thus, our data suggest that SEL1L is a critical regulator of β-cell function and growth in adult mice. Generation of Sel1l gene trap mice (Sel1l+/−) was described previously (35Francisco A.B. Singh R. Li S. Vani A.K. Yang L. Munroe R.J. Diaferia G. Cardano M. Biunno I. Qi L. Schimenti J.C. Long Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13694-13703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For physiological studies, Sel1l+/− mice were back-crossed to C57/B6 mice for five generations and then intercrossed to generate wild-type and Sel1l+/− mice. All mice were weaned at 3 weeks of age, and genotyping was done by PCR using the following primers: F1-Sel1l, 5′-TGGGACAGAGCGGGCTTGGAAT-3′; R1-Sel1l, 5′-CACCAGGAGTCAAAGGCATCACTG-3′; R-βGeo, 5′-ATTCAGGCTGCGCAACTGTTGGG-3′. For high fat diet feeding experiments, wild-type and heterozygous male mice at 6–8 weeks of age were put on a TD.06414 diet (Harlan, Madison, WI), which contains 23.5, 27.3, and 34.3% protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Cornell Animal Care and Use Guidelines. Fasting blood glucose was measured using an Ascensia Elite XL glucometer (Bayer). Glucose and insulin tolerance tests and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) were performed essentially as described (37Sachdeva M.M. Claiborn K.C. Khoo C. Yang J. Groff D.N. Mirmira R.G. Stoffers D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19090-19095Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For the glucose tolerance test, mice were fasted for 6–8 hours and then injected intraperitoneal with 2 g of d-glucose/kg body weight. Blood glucose was measured at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose injection. For the insulin tolerance test, mice were fasted for 6 hours and then injected intraperitoneally with 1.0 unit of regular human insulin (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN)/kg body weight dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Blood glucose was measured at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min post-insulin injection. 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) was administered into mice by gavage as previously described (38Ozcan U. Yilmaz E. Ozcan L. Furuhashi M. Vaillancourt E. Smith R.O. Görgün C.Z. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2006; 313: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Pancreata were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C and paraffin embedded. Pancreatic sections were cut at 5-μm and mounted on glass slides. Insulin immunostaining was performed by using guinea pig anti-human insulin (Linco, 1:1000). Secondary antibodies used were either Cy2- or HRP-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin (IgG) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:500). Nuclear counterstaining was performed using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). β-Cell mass was determined as previously described (37Sachdeva M.M. Claiborn K.C. Khoo C. Yang J. Groff D.N. Mirmira R.G. Stoffers D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19090-19095Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, total pancreatic and β-cell areas were measured using the AxioVision software (Version 4.1). β-Cell mass was calculated by multiplying the total pancreatic weight with the percentage of β-cell area. To determine β-cell proliferation, pancreatic sections were co-immunostained with a mouse monoclonal anti-Ki67 (Vector Laboratories, 1:500) and anti-insulin antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The percentage of Ki67+ cells was derived by dividing the total number of counted β-cell nuclei with the number of Ki67+ nuclei. β-Cell apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay using the ApopTag In Situ Apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All images were acquired using an Axiovert 40 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with an AxioCam camera. Pancreatic insulin content was determined as previously described (39Gupta S. McGrath B. Cavener D.R. Diabetes. 2010; 59: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreata were removed from mice and homogenized in 1 ml of acid ethanol (95% ethanol, 10.2 n HCl in a 50:1 ratio). The homogenized pancreata were incubated overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged. Insulin concentration in the supernatant was determined using ELISA (Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL) and normalized by total protein content. Mouse islet isolation was performed as previously described (40Scharp D.W. Kemp C.B. Knight M.J. Ballinger W.F. Lacy P.E. Transplantation. 1973; 16: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, after sacrifice of each mouse, the pancreas was perfused with 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, containing 2.0 mg/ml type V collagenase (Sigma). The inflated pancreas was removed from the body and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The collagenase-digested pancreas was vigorously shaken for 5 s, washed 3 times with 5–7 ml of ice-cold 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer, and re-suspended in 2 ml of 28% Ficoll (VWR, West Chester, PA). The islet and acinar mixture was loaded onto the top of gradient Ficoll solutions and centrifuged at 2250 rpm for 7 min at 4 °C. Islets were collected and washed three times with ice-cold 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution before processing for further analysis. GSIS for islets was performed as previously described with minor modifications (41Zhang W. Feng D. Li Y. Iida K. McGrath B. Cavener D.R. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated islets were washed twice with 1× KRBH buffer (118.5 mm NaCl, 2.54 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 1.19 mm KH2PO4, 4.74 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.19 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 5 mm glutamic acid, 5 mm fumaric acid, 5 mm pyruvic acid, pH 7.4) and equilibrated in the same buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose for 60 min at 37 °C. Islets were then incubated in 1× KRBH buffer containing either 2.8 or 16.8 mm glucose for 30 min at 37 °C. The low and high glucose-incubated islets were briefly centrifuged, and the supernatants were assayed for secreted insulin, which was normalized to islet insulin content. Islet insulin content was normalized to the total protein concentration. RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR were performed as previously described (35Francisco A.B. Singh R. Li S. Vani A.K. Yang L. Munroe R.J. Diaferia G. Cardano M. Biunno I. Qi L. Schimenti J.C. Long Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13694-13703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed using the PrimerSelect program of Lasergene 7.1 Sequence Analysis Software (DNAStar, Madison, WI). Relative mRNA expression was calculated by dividing the expression value in Sel1l+/− islets (set to 1) with that in wild-type islets. Min6 cells were maintained as previously described (42Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). For establishing stable cell lines, Min6 cells were grown to 50–60% confluency, trypsinized, washed three times in cold PBS, and resuspended in PBS. 5.6 × 106/ml was mixed with 10–20 μg of plasmid DNA, electroporated (0.24 kV and 500 microfarads) and plated into a 24-well plate. The electroporated Min6 cells were incubated in regular media for 48 h and then in neomycin resistance selection medium (G418 at 1 mg/ml) for 10 days. Stable Min6 clones were maintained in regular medium. GSIS for Min6 cells was performed essentially as previously described (43Dowling P. O'Driscoll L. O'Sullivan F. Dowd A. Henry M. Jeppesen P.B. Meleady P. Clynes M. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 6578-6587Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells were maintained as previously described (44Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). For generation of stable cell lines, INS-1 cells were seeded at a confluency of <10% and infected overnight with lentivirus expressing the reverse tet transactivator (rtTA), rtTA plus SEL1L-GFP, or rtTA plus dSEL1L-GFP. To induced expression of transgenes, doxycycline (Sigma) was added into the culture medium of Min6 and INS-1 cells (200 μg/ml). Transient transfection and Gaussia luciferase (G-luc) assay in Min6 cells were performed as previously described (35Francisco A.B. Singh R. Li S. Vani A.K. Yang L. Munroe R.J. Diaferia G. Cardano M. Biunno I. Qi L. Schimenti J.C. Long Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13694-13703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cell growth profile was generated, and thymidine incorporation assay was performed as previously described (45Li S. Francisco A.B. Han C. Pattabiraman S. Foote M.R. Giesy S.L. Wang C. Schimenti J.C. Boisclair Y.R. Long Q. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 4121-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Preparation of tissue/cell lysates, protein quantification, electrophoresis, and blotting were performed as previously described (35Francisco A.B. Singh R. Li S. Vani A.K. Yang L. Munroe R.J. Diaferia G. Cardano M. Biunno I. Qi L. Schimenti J.C. Long Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13694-13703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was carried out using the Western blotting Luminol Reagent kit (Origene) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The primary antibodies used were: GFP (Abcam, 1:5,000), tubulin (Cell Signaling, 1:10,000), calnexin (Assay Design, 1:10,000), p-eIF2a (Cell Signaling, 1:2000), eIF2a (Cell Signaling, 1:2,000), ERP57 (Assay Design, 1:2,000), PDI (Assay Design, 1:5,000), HRD1 (Novus Biologicals, 1:1,000), ERO1L (Novus Biologicals, 1:2,000) and GRP78 (Santa Cruz, 1:1,000). Differences between compared groups were evaluated by performing two-tailed Student's t test, and p < 0.05 is considered significant. We recently reported that mice homozygous for a gene trap mutation in Sel1l (Sel1l−/−) develop systemic ER stress and die during mid-gestation (35Francisco A.B. Singh R. Li S. Vani A.K. Yang L. Munroe R.J. Diaferia G. Cardano M. Biunno I. Qi L. Schimenti J.C. Long Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13694-13703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine the functional role of SEL1L in adult pancreatic β-cells, we investigated whether haploid insufficiency of SEL1L affects glucose homeostasis in mice. Wild-type and Sel1l+/− male mice at 10 weeks of age were fed with normal chow (NC) and a high fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks (Fig. 1A). Sel1l+/− and wild-type mice showed similar body weight gain profiles in response to the two diets (Fig. 1B). Basal fasting blood glucose levels of Sel1l+/− and wild-type mice were comparable (supplemental Fig. S1A) and remained insignificantly changed in response to NC feeding (Fig. 1C). However, after 8 weeks of HFD, Sel1l+/− mice showed significantly higher blood glucose levels than the wild-type control mice (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that mice with one functional allele of Sel1l are genetically predisposed to HFD-induced hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia in mice may be the result of a defective insulin production, action, or both. To determine the specific causes underlying the impaired glucose homeostasis in Sel1l+/− mice, we first assessed whether haploid insufficiency of SEL1L reduces insulin sensitivity in organs such as liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Insulin tolerance tests showed that Sel1l+/− mice showed comparable insulin sensitivity to wild-type mice (Fig. 1D), suggesting that haploinsufficiency of SEL1L did not significantly affect peripheral insulin signaling. Next, we examined whether Sel1l+/− mice had an impaired β-cell function using glucose tolerance tests. Sel1l+/− and wild-type mice fed with NC showed similar glucose tolerance to wild-type control mice (supplemental Fig. S1B). However, Sel1l+/− mice fed with HFD exhibited significantly higher glucose intolerance than wild-type control mice (Fig. 1E). Administration of 4-PBA, a chemical chaperone previously shown to enhance insulin signaling (38Ozcan U. Yilmaz E. Ozcan L. Furuhashi M. Vaillancourt E. Smith R.O. Görgün C.Z. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2006; 313: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar), resulted in a significant reduction of serum glucose levels in both Sel1l+/− and wild-type mice fed with HFD (Fig. 1F). Together, these data suggest that in our current diet-induced obesity model, haploid insufficiency of Sel1l impairs insulin production in pancreatic β-cells and had little effect on insulin action in peripheral organs. We next assessed the serum insulin levels in Sel1l+/− mice fed with NC and HFD using insulin ELISA. No significant difference in serum insulin level was observed between Sel1l+/− and wild-type mice fed with NC. However, Sel1l+/− mice fed with HFD showed significantly higher serum insulin levels than wild-type control mice (Fig. 2A). The pancreatic insulin contents of wild-type and Sel1l+/− mice fed with HFD were comparable (supplemental Fig. S2A). We next carried out glucose-stimulated insulin secretion studies in Sel1l+/− mice. Although Sel1l+/− mice fed with NC showed no difference in GSIS to wild-type control mice (Fig. 2C), Sel1l+/− mice fed with HFD showed a significantly lower GSIS as compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2B). These results together with the finding that Sel1l+/− mice were glucose-intolerant (Fig. 1E) indicate that haploid insufficiency of SEL1L also causes impairment in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The functional β-cell mass is a critical factor in determining how much insulin is released into the blood in response to glucose stimulation. As Sel1l+/− mice showed an impaired pancreatic function, we speculated that Sel1l+/− mice fed with HFD might have a reduced β-cell mass. To test this, we carried out morphological analysis of the endocrine pancreas in Sel1l+/− fed with HFD. Wild-type and Sel1l+/− mice on HFD for 8 weeks showed no difference in β-cell masses (Fig. 2C). However, after 20 weeks of HFD-feeding, Sel1l+/− mice exhibited a markedly reduced β-cell mass as compared with that of wild-type mice (Fig. 2, D–F). We then investigated whether the reduction of β-cell mass in Sel1l+/− mice was due to an increased apoptosis or a decreased β-cell proliferation. In situ cell apoptosis assays showed that there was no significant difference in β-cell apoptosis between Sel1l+/− and wild-type mice (supplemental Fig. S2B). However, Sel1l+/− islets contained a significantly lower number of Ki67-positive β-cells than wild-type islets (Fig. 2, G–I). Together, these results indicate that Sel1l+/− mice fed with HFD for 20 weeks had a reduced β-cell mass, and the reduction of β-cell mass in Sel1l+/− mice was due at least in part to an impaired compensatory β-cell growth. SEL1L is a critical component of the ER-associated protein degradation machinery, and SEL1L deficiency results in systemic ER stress in mouse embryonic cells (35Francisco A.B. Singh R. Li S. Vani A.K. Yang L. Munroe R.J. Diaferia G. Cardano M. Biunno I. Qi L. Schimenti J.C. Long Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13694-13703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We, therefore, next investigated possible alterations of the UPR pathway in liver and pancreatic islets of Sel1l+/− mice fed with HFD. First, we cultured islets isolated from wild-type and Sel1l+/− mice in the presence of low (10 mm) and high (30 mm) glucose and performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis of UPR marker genes. Wild-type and Sel1l+/− islets treated with low glucose showed comparable expression of Bip, Herp, Chop, Xbp-1s, and p58IPK at the mRNA level (Fig. 3A). However, Bip, Herp, Chop, and Xbp-1s were significantly up-regulated in high glucose-treated Sel1l+/− islets as opposed to wild-type control islets (Fig. 3B). Treatment of Sel1l+/− pancreatic islets with 30 mm glucose in the presence of the chemical chaperon 4-PBA markedly reduced the transcription of Bip, Herp, Xbp-1s, and p58IPK (Fig. 3C). ER stress has previously been mechanistically linked to obesity-induced insulin resistance in mice (25Ozcan U. Cao Q. Yilmaz E. Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Ozdelen E. Tuncman G. Görgün C. Glimcher L.H. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2004; 306: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Because Sel1l+/− mice were modestly insulin-intolerant (Fig. 1D), we speculated that this might be due to low levels of ER stress in peripheral organs such as liver and adipose tissue. To test this, we prepared lysates from livers of Sel1l+/− and wild-type control mice fed with HFD and examined the expression of a number of UPR genes through Western blot analyses (Fig. 3D).

We used a quality score to assess the reporting in articles describing the medical characteristics of VS in Italian newspapers. Methodology/Principal Findings Our search covered a 7-month period from July 1, 2008, to February 28, 2009, using the online searchable databases of four major Italian newspapers: Corriere della Sera, La Repubblica, La Stampa, and Avvenire. Medical reporting was judged as complete if three core VS characteristics were described: patient unawareness of self and the environment, preserved wakefulness (eyes open), and spontaneous respiration (artificial ventilator not needed). We retrieved 2,099 articles, and 967 were dedicated to VS. Of these, 853 (88.2%) were non-medical and mainly focused on describing the political, legal, and ethical aspects of VS. Of the 114 (11.8%) medical articles, 53 (5.5%) discussed other medical problems such as death by dehydration, artificial nutrition, neuroimaging, brain death, or uterine hemorrhage, and 61 (6.3%) described VS. Of these 61, only 18 (1.9%) reported all three CORE characteristics and were judged complete. We found no differences among the four investigated newspapers (Fisher's exact = 0.798), and incomplete articles were equally distributed between journalistic pieces and expert opinions (χ2 = 1.8854, P = 0.170). Incorrect descriptions of VS were significantly more common among incomplete articles (13 of 43 vs. 1 of 18; Fisher's exact P = 0.047). Conclusions/Significance Core VS characteristics are rarely reported in Italian newspaper articles, which can alter adequate comprehension of new developments and (mis)inform political, legal, and ethical decisions."
https://openalex.org/W1963992782,"Background A non-human primate (NHP) model of gluten sensitivity was employed to study the gene perturbations associated with dietary gluten changes in small intestinal tissues from gluten-sensitive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Methodology Stages of remission and relapse were accomplished in gluten-sensitive animals by administration of gluten-free (GFD) and gluten-containing (GD) diets, as described previously. Pin-head-sized biopsies, obtained non-invasively by pediatric endoscope from duodenum while on GFD or GD, were used for preparation of total RNA and gene profiling, using the commercial Rhesus Macaque Microarray (Agilent Technologies),targeting expression of over 20,000 genes. Principal Findings When compared with normal healthy control, gluten-sensitive macaques showed differential gene expressions induced by GD. While observed gene perturbations were classified into one of 12 overlapping categories - cancer, metabolism, digestive tract function, immune response, cell growth, signal transduction, autoimmunity, detoxification of xenobiotics, apoptosis, actin-collagen deposition, neuronal and unknown function - this study focused on cancer-related gene networks such as cytochrome P450 family (detoxification function) and actin-collagen-matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) genes. Conclusions/Significance A loss of detoxification function paralleled with necessity to metabolize carcinogens was revealed in gluten-sensitive animals while on GD. An increase in cancer-promoting factors and a simultaneous decrease in cancer-preventing factors associated with altered expression of actin-collagen-MMP gene network were noted. In addition, gluten-sensitive macaques showed reduced number of differentially expressed genes including the cancer-associated ones upon withdrawal of dietary gluten. Taken together, these findings indicate potentially expanded utility of gluten-sensitive rhesus macaques in cancer research."
https://openalex.org/W2048686155,"The motor protein myosin uses energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to produce force and motion. Important conserved components (P-loop, switch I, and switch II) help propagate small conformational changes at the active site into large scale conformational changes in distal regions of the protein. Structural and biochemical studies have indicated that switch I may be directly responsible for the reciprocal opening and closing of the actin and nucleotide-binding pockets during the ATPase cycle, thereby aiding in the coordination of these important substrate-binding sites. Smooth muscle myosin has displayed the ability to simultaneously bind tightly to both actin and ADP, although it is unclear how both substrate-binding clefts could be closed if they are rigidly coupled to switch I. Here we use single tryptophan mutants of smooth muscle myosin to determine how conformational changes in switch I are correlated with structural changes in the nucleotide and actin-binding clefts in the presence of actin and ADP. Our results suggest that a closed switch I conformation in the strongly bound actomyosin-ADP complex is responsible for maintaining tight nucleotide binding despite an open nucleotide-binding pocket.

This unique state is likely to be crucial for prolonged tension maintenance in smooth muscle. Myosin is a molecular motor that uses energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to produce force and motion along an actin filament during muscle contraction and other forms of cell motility. The myosin motor domain consists of a 95-kDa globular domain containing separate actin and nucleotide-binding sites and is connected to an extended 85-Å-long α-helix, termed the lever arm, which is important in generating force and motion by undergoing a rotation called the powerstroke (1Palm T.

To ensure efficient energy transduction, the mechanical powerstroke is tightly coupled to the enzymatic ATPase cycle of myosin, with the nucleotide state of the active site dictating both the lever arm position and myosin interaction with actin. The active site of myosin shows remarkable similarity to that of G-proteins as well as motor kinesin (8Kull F.J. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1590-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The principle components of this active site architecture are a seven-stranded β-sheet comprising the core of the binding pocket and three flexible loops known as the P-loop, switch I, and switch II, which coordinate the bound nucleotide (7Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar, 10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Although conformational changes in the P-loop are generally not observed in structural studies, switches I and II have been shown to undergo significant changes in conformation based on the presence or absence of the γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide (3Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Small changes in active site switch positions are propagated into larger rearrangements in distal regions of the motor with switch I thought to affect the actin-binding cleft and switch II thought to affect the position of the lever arm (11Holmes K.C. Geeves M.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The actin-binding cleft is located within the 50-kDa tryptic fragment of the myosin motor domain (7Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). This subdomain can be divided into two components known as the upper and lower 50-kDa domains, with strong actin binding requiring contact with both domains. The upper 50-kDa domain forms one face of both the actin and nucleotide-binding pockets based on its position within the protein. The available crystal structures suggest that opening of switch I within the active site of myosin is associated with a rotation of the upper 50-kDa domain causing closing of the actin-binding cleft and subsequent strong binding to actin (12Coureux P.D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Generally, myosin shows antagonistic substrate affinity, only binding strongly to nucleotide or actin at any one time (12Coureux P.D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 13Holmes K.C. Angert I. Kull F.J. Jahn W. Schröder R.R. Nature. 2003; 425: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus it is thought that opening of switch I and rotation of the upper 50-kDa domain result in both closure of the actin-binding cleft and opening of the nucleotide-binding cleft, favoring product release upon strong actin binding (13Holmes K.C.

Recent results have indicated that the relationship between switch I and the actin-binding cleft is not as simple as the above model implies (16Nyitrai M. Rossi R. Adamek N.

In EPR studies of active site architecture, there was shown to be two actomyosin-ADP states in skeletal myosin: one open and one closed. The two states showed a temperature-dependent equilibrium between them, favoring the closed conformation of the active site at lower temperatures. There is also kinetic evidence from different myosin isoforms, indicating the presence of multiple actomyosin-ADP states (17Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Whitaker M. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Wells A.

In smooth muscle myosin, strong binding to both actin and ADP has been proposed to be necessary for the formation of the latch state, where a decrease in regulatory light chain phosphorylation leads to maintained tension for long periods of time with little hydrolysis of ATP (21Dillon P.F. Aksoy M.O. Driska S.P. Murphy R.A. Science. 1981; 211: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and which may be related to the closed active site state previously observed at low temperature by EPR and transient kinetics (16Nyitrai M. Rossi R. Adamek N. Pellegrino M.A. Bottinelli R. Geeves M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Whitaker M. Cheung H.C. Brown F.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The structural basis of such a state is currently unknown but is likely to involve conformational changes in switch I. However, it is unclear whether switch I in smooth muscle myosin can adopt multiple conformations in the actomyosin-ADP state and if so, what effect these changes would have on the actin and nucleotide-binding sites of the molecule. By separately placing single nonendogenous tryptophan residues into switch I and the upper 50-kDa domain, we are able to demonstrate a closure of switch I in the presence of actin. Additionally, we show that this closure of switch I does not have an effect on the actin binding properties of the smooth muscle myosin motor or the conformation of the nucleotide-binding pocket. We believe that this previously unobserved closure of switch I restricts nucleotide release from a strongly bound actomyosin complex in a strain-sensitive manner. Such a mechanism is consistent with the ability of smooth muscle myosin to maintain tension for extended periods of time with minimal energy expenditure (i.e. the “latch” state) and may be a common feature shared with other nonmuscle isoforms of myosin that exhibit a high affinity for ADP while strongly bound to actin (22De La Cruz E.M.

Nonlabeled ADP was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of the highest quality available. mant-labeled ADP 3-[N-morpholino] propanesulfonic acid smooth muscle myosin motor domain with essential light chain. All of the experiments unless otherwise indicated were performed in MOPS buffer at pH 7.4 at 20 °C (20 mm MOPS, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Imidazole buffer (10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4 at 20 °C, 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was used during protein purification. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create a single tryptophan mutant cDNA that codes for the chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, containing the motor domain and truncated after the essential light chain (MDE: residues 1–819, kindly provided by Dr. Kathleen M. Trybus, University of Vermont). The seven endogenous tryptophan residues were mutated to phenylalanine, except for Trp-546, which was mutated to methionine (28Yengo C.M. Fagnant P.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 12944-12949Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the single nonendogenous tryptophans were inserted to monitor the upper 50-kDa domain at position F344W, as described previously (29Robertson C.I. Gaffney 2nd, D.P. Chrin L.R. Berger C.L. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1882-1892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and at position F248W to monitor switch I. A FLAG epitope (DYKDDDK) was attached to the C terminus of the cDNA for purification purposes (30Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-735PubMed Google Scholar). The F344W and F248W constructs were expressed using the baculovirus expression system by coinfecting Sf9 insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding the mutant heavy chain and the essential light chain as described previously (31Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of purity was determined by SDS-PAGE using Coomassie-stained gels. Purified MDE concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad microplate assay with wild-type MDE as a standard. Each experiment was repeated on at least two or three different preparations. Actin used in fluorescence measurements was purified from acetone powder as described previously (33Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified actin was determined spectroscopically using an extinction coefficient of 0.63 mg ml−1cm−1 at 290 nm. Pyrene labeling of actin was carried out as described previously (34Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Briefly, actin was fully reduced with 2 mm DTT for 1 h and incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of pyrene-iodoacetamide for 20 h in the dark. Labeled actin was pelleted, and the relative concentrations of pyrene and actin were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 29,400 m−1 cm−1 for pyrene actin. Labeling efficiency was calculated to be >92%. Basal ATPase rates were measured for each preparation to ensure that activity was retained during purification. ATPase rates were measured at 37 °C in high ionic strength ammonium-EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris, 35 mm EDTA, 400 mm NH4Cl, pH 7.4), as described previously (35White H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Actin-activated ATPase assays were performed at 37 °C in low ionic strength buffer (10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, 7 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) using a range of actin concentrations (0–40 μm). The resulting rates were plotted and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA) version 5.0a for Mac OS X. Fluorescence measurements were obtained on a Quantamaster fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ) equipped with a 50-W zenon arc lamp excitation source and excitation/emission monochrometers. Protein samples in standard MOPS buffer were excited at 295 nm, and emission was collected at 340 nm through a WG320 longpass filter using 2-nm excitation and 3-nm emission slit widths. All of the spectra were corrected for Raman scatter and background fluorescence by subtraction of the appropriate buffer blank. MDE concentrations of 1–3 μm were used in all emission scans. ADP was used at a saturating concentration of 2 mm, whereas the mant-ADP concentration used was 10 μm to prevent inner filter effects from the mant moiety. Scans using mant nucleotides were corrected for nonsaturating concentrations of nucleotide by calculating the fraction of nucleotide bound using Equation 1,fB=(KA[M]+KA[N]+1)-(KA[M]+KA[N]+1)2-4⋅KA[M]⋅KA[N]2⋅KA[M]Eq. 1 where fB is the fraction bound, KA is the association constant (1/KD), [M] is the MDE concentration in the assay, and [N] is the mant nucleotide concentration. The calculated fraction bound was then used to correct the observed fluorescence using Equation 2,IC=IM-(1-fB)⋅IFfBEq. 2 where IC is the corrected intensity based on fraction-bound nucleotide, IF is the steady-state emission intensity collected in the absence of nucleotide, IM is the steady-state emission intensity actually measured, and fB is the fraction of mant nucleotide bound based on the calculation from Equation 1. Emission scans of pyrene actin were excited at 365 nm, and emission was scanned from 380 to 450 nm through a 370-nm longpass filter with 2- and 4-nm excitation and emission slit widths, respectively. Pyrene actin (0.5 μm) was mixed with 1.5 μm F248W-MDE in the absence of nucleotide, followed by subsequent additions of 1 mm ADP, to examine the relative actin binding properties of the motor in each state. Recovery of pyrene actin fluorescence upon the release of myosin from actin was followed upon the addition of 1 mm ATP. The KD for mADP binding to our single tryptophan mutants was determined to correct steady-state emission scans for incomplete nucleotide binding. Briefly, MDE (1.5 μm) was titrated with increasing concentrations of nucleotide (0.5–20 μm), and the decrease in tryptophan emission was measured at 340 nm with 295-nm excitation. The fluorescence emission values were corrected for dilution and inner filter effects, and normalized relative to that of protein in the absence of nucleotide. A plot of (1 − corrected intensity) versus mant nucleotide concentration was fit to Equation 3 using nonlinear regression to determine KD.(1-correctedI)=[Nucleotide]KD+[Nucleotide]Eq. 3 The energy transfer efficiency (E) between the F248W or F344W tryptophan residue and the mant nucleotide at the active site was measured using FRET (36Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Efficiency was calculated based on the tryptophan emission in the presence or absence of the acceptor mant moiety,E=1-(FDAFD)Eq. 4 where FDA is the corrected emission intensity in the presence of mant nucleotide, and FD is the emission intensity in the presence of unlabeled nucleotide. The distance (r) between the donor and acceptor probes was determined using Equation 5,r=R0(E-1-1)16(Å)Eq. 5 where R0 is the Förster distance at which E = 50%. R0 was calculated using Equation 6,R0=9.79×103⋅(K2⋅J⋅QD⋅n-4)16(Å)Eq. 6 where n is the refractive index of the buffer (assumed to be 1.4), QD is the measured quantum yield of the donor tryptophan in the absence of the acceptor, K2 is an orientation factor which is assumed to be ⅔ (consistent with free rotation of the donor and acceptor probes), and J is the spectral overlap between the donor emission and acceptor excitation given by (Equation 7),J=∫FD(λ)⋅∈A(λ)⋅λ4dλEq. 7 where λ is the wavelength in cm, FD is the normalized intensity of the unquenched donor, and ∈A is the extinction coefficient of the acceptor. Measured values for QD, J, KD, FRET efficiency (E), R0, and average distance (r) are presented in Table 2.TABLE 2Fluorescent properties of single tryptophan constructsConstructTemperatureKDQDJFRET efficiency (E)R0R°Cμmcm3 m−1ÅÅF344W-ADP202.9 ± 0.30.136.07 × 10−150.22 ± 0.0622.227.4 ± 2.6F344W-ADP152.4 ± 0.20.136.06 × 10−150.20 ± 0.0722.128.3 ± 2.4F344W-ADP102.7 ± 0.30.136.04 × 10−150.22 ± 0.1022.127.7 ± 3.8ActoF344W-ADP2011.7 ± 1.9NANA0.36 ± 0.0522.224.3 ± 1.3ActoF344W-ADP159.3 ± 1.9NANA0.29 ± 0.0422.125.5 ± 1.3ActoF344W-ADP109.4 ± 1.6NANA0.34 ± 0.0522.124.5 ± 1.3F248W-ADP202.9 ± 0.10.0246.22 × 10−150.29 ± 0.0816.819.9 ± 1.8F248W-ADP153.0 ± 0.10.0276.19 × 10−150.35 ± 0.0817.119.0 ± 1.6F248W-ADP102.8 ± 0.10.0276.21 × 10−150.38 ± 0.0617.118.6 ± 1.1ActoF248W-ADP2010 ± 2.6NANA0.73 ± 0.0716.814.4 ± 1.2ActoF248W-ADP159.5 ± 2.7NANA0.74 ± 0.0317.114.3 ± 0.6ActoF248W-ADP109.6 ± 1.7NANA0.83 ± 0.0217.113.1 ± 0.2F248W-ADP-BeFx20NA0.0046.12 × 10−150.36 ± 0.0512.413.7 ± 0.7F248W-ADP-BeFx15NA0.0056.09 × 10−150.38 ± 0.0512.913.9 ± 0.7F248W-ADP-BeFx10NA0.0056.05 × 10−150.41 ± 0.0412.813.6 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab Sensitized emission spectra were used as a way to measure FRET efficiency in the presence of actin. Emission was measured at 450 nm through a 420-nm longpass filter, whereas excitation wavelengths were scanned from 245 to 390 nm. Slit widths of 2 and 4 nm for excitation and emission were used, respectively. The spectra were corrected for the background fluorescence from protein components and incomplete nucleotide binding and normalized the fluorescence peak at 260 nm to account for the change in quantum yield of the mant moiety with changing temperature. The FRET efficiency can be calculated from sensitized emission scans using the equation,E=∈A(λDex)∈D(λDex)(FAD(λAcm)FA(λAcm)-1)(1fD)Eq. 8 where ∈A(λDex) is equal to the extinction coefficient of the acceptor at 285 nm, ∈D(λDex) is the extinction coefficient of the donor at 285 nm, FAD(λAem) is the emission intensity of the donor plus acceptor at 450 nm after 285 nm excitation, FA(λAem) is emission intensity of the acceptor alone at 450 nm after 285 nm excitation, and fD is the fractional donor labeling. The extinction coefficient of the acceptor at 285 nm was measured to be 3 × 102 m−1 cm−1, and that of the donor was 5.5 × 103 m−1 cm−1. Calculated FRET efficiency values are shown in Table 2, a representative trace in supplemental Fig. S1. Control experiments showing changes in sensitized emission in the presence of mant-labeled ATP versus mADP and the lack of energy transfer between mADP and actin are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. The enhancement of mADP fluorescence upon binding to F344W or to acto-F344W was measured by excitation of samples at 360 nm and measuring the emission from 415 to 500 nm through a 370-nm longpass filter using slit widths of 2 nm for excitation and 4 nm for emission. The enhancement of mADP fluorescence was determined by dividing the integrated area of the emission spectra for the mADP complexes by that of the spectra for mADP alone. All of the spectra were corrected for background fluorescence before integration. The enhancement of mADP fluorescence was then normalized for the fraction of nucleotide bound to myosin, which was determined in the absence of actin by using the measured KD values in Table 2 and Equations 1 and 2. In the presence of actin, the fraction of bound nucleotide was determined using the measured KD values in Table 2, as well as the amplitudes from time-resolved fluorescent lifetimes (f3) of the mADP nucleotide in the presence of actomyosin (Table 3).TABLE 3Time-resolved fluorescence of mADP in the actomyosin complexSampleτ1τ2τ3F1F2F3τ(ave)χ2nsnsnsMantADP20 °C3.511.170.890.113.240.615 °C3.781.380.880.123.460.8110 °C3.831.430.890.113.531.42MDE-Actin MantADP20 °C3.511.17120.780.10.124.31.4815 °C3.781.3810.60.760.110.134.241.3810 °C3.831.4310.60.760.10.144.50.94 Open table in a new tab Phase and modulation data were obtained using an ISS Chronos Fluorometer with a 375 nm LED light source. A F01-375/6-25 bandpass filter (centered at 375 nm with a FWHM of 6 nm) was placed after the excitation source to eliminate spurious light, and the emission was observed through a 420-nm longpass filter. Polarizers were set at magic angles to eliminate polarization effects (37Spencer R.D. Weber G. J. Chem. Phys. 1970; 52: 1654-1663Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Dimethyl 1,4-bis(5-phenyloxazol-2-yl)benzene dissolved in ethanol was used as the lifetime reference (1.45 ns). The data were analyzed multiexponential functions using Globals software (E. Gratton, University of California Irvine, Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics) with 0.2 and 0.004 as the standard errors for phase and modulation, respectively. A representative trace of time-resolved phase and modulation data is shown in supplemental Fig. S3. The lifetime values of free mantADP are presented at each temperature. Knowing that we have free mantADP in solution when we added MDE-actin complex, we fixed the lifetime components of free mantADP and allowed the additional lifetime component to float during the fitting procedure. Temperature control in steady-state fluorescence experiments was accomplished using a temperature-controlled TLC 50 cuvette holder from Quantum Northwest (Spokane, WA) attached to a water bath. In time-resolved fluorescence measurements, a circulating water bath (Fischer) was used to maintain the temperature. The steady-state enzymatic activity of the F344W MDE mutant has been previously characterized in our laboratory (29Robertson C.I. Gaffney 2nd, D.P. Chrin L.R. Berger C.L. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1882-1892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The basal ATPase activity for the mutant was shown to be increased compared with the WT MDE (0.35 s−1 versus 0.08 s−1, respectively) (29Robertson C.I. Gaffney 2nd, D.P. Chrin L.R. Berger C.L. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1882-1892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The actin-activated Vmax was decreased 3-fold (0.74 s−1 for WT MDE and 0.23 s−1 for F344W), whereas the catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) was increased for the mutant over the wild-type MDE construct (Table 1). This is consistent with other single tryptophan smooth muscle myosin mutants, which show similar decreased activity but increased catalytic efficiency (28Yengo C.M. Fagnant P.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Likewise, the F248W MDE mutant has an increased basal ATPase activity (0.31 s−1), with a Vmax of 0.32 s−1 and a Km of 2.3 μm, which also increases the catalytic efficiency over WT MDE (Table 1). The measured KD values for mADP binding to our single tryptophan constructs were 2.9 ± 0.1 μm for F248W MDE and 2.9 ± 0.3 μm for F344W MDE when measured at 20 °C. The measured KD values did not change significantly as a function of temperature (Table 2). KD values in the presence of actin increased to ∼10 μm for each of our constructs, consistent with the 5-fold decrease in affinity previously observed (39Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Steady-state enzymatic propertiesConstructVmaxKmVmax/Kms−1μms−1μm−1WT MDE0.74620.012F344W0.23150.015F248W0.322.30.14 Open table in a new tab By measuring the fluorescence of F248W MDE in the presence of unlabeled nucleotides as well as mant-labeled nucleotides, we were able to calculate the FRET efficiency and average distance between the tryptophan and mant moieties at each temperature.

https://openalex.org/W1990160182,"Comprehensive characterization of a gene's impact on phenotypes requires knowledge of the context of the gene. To address this issue we introduce a systematic data integration method Candidate Genes and SNPs (CANGES) that links SNP and linkage disequilibrium data to pathway- and protein-protein interaction information. It can be used as a knowledge discovery tool for the search of disease associated causative variants from genome-wide studies as well as to generate new hypotheses on synergistically functioning genes. We demonstrate the utility of CANGES by integrating pathway and protein-protein interaction data to identify putative functional variants for (i) the p53 gene and (ii) three glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) associated risk genes. For the GBM case, we further integrate the CANGES results with clinical and genome-wide data for 209 GBM patients and identify genes having effects on GBM patient survival. Our results show that selecting a focused set of genes can result in information beyond the traditional genome-wide association approaches. Taken together, holistic approach to identify possible interacting genes and SNPs with CANGES provides a means to rapidly identify networks for any set of genes and generate novel hypotheses. CANGES is available in http://csbi.ltdk.helsinki.fi/CANGES/"
