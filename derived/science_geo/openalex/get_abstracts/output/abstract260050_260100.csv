https://openalex.org/W2107660300,"Mutations in superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) cause a form of the fatal paralytic disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), presumably by a combination of cell-autonomous and non–cell-autonomous processes. Here, we show that expression of mutated human SOD1 in primary mouse spinal motor neurons does not provoke motor neuron degeneration. Conversely, rodent astrocytes expressing mutated SOD1 kill spinal primary and embryonic mouse stem cell–derived motor neurons. This is triggered by soluble toxic factor(s) through a Bax-dependent mechanism. However, mutant astrocytes do not cause the death of spinal GABAergic or dorsal root ganglion neurons or of embryonic stem cell–derived interneurons. In contrast to astrocytes, fibroblasts, microglia, cortical neurons and myocytes expressing mutated SOD1 do not cause overt neurotoxicity. These findings indicate that astrocytes may play a role in the specific degeneration of spinal motor neurons in ALS. Identification of the astrocyte-derived soluble factor(s) may have far-reaching implications for ALS from both a pathogenic and therapeutic standpoint."

https://openalex.org/W1993064034,"Here we report an in vitro model system for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from mice carrying normal or mutant transgenic alleles of the human SOD1 gene were used to generate motor neurons by in vitro differentiation. These motor neurons could be maintained in long-term coculture either with additional cells that arose during differentiation or with primary glial cells. Motor neurons carrying either the nonpathological human SOD1 transgene or the mutant SOD1(G93A) allele showed neurodegenerative properties when cocultured with SOD1(G93A) glial cells. Thus, our studies demonstrate that glial cells carrying a human SOD1(G93A) mutation have a direct, non-cell autonomous effect on motor neuron survival. More generally, our results show that ESC-based models of disease provide a powerful tool for studying the mechanisms of neural degeneration. These phenotypes displayed in culture could provide cell-based assays for the identification of new ALS drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2120742544,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) are pluripotent lines that can differentiate in vitro into cell derivatives of all three germ layers, including cardiomyocytes. Successful application of these unique cells in the areas of cardiovascular research and regenerative medicine has been hampered by difficulties in identifying and selecting specific cardiac progenitor cells from the mixed population of differentiating cells. We report the generation of stable transgenic hESC lines, using lentiviral vectors, and single-cell clones that express a reporter gene (eGFP) under the transcriptional control of a cardiac-specific promoter (the human myosin light chain-2V promoter). Our results demonstrate the appearance of eGFP-expressing cells during the differentiation of the hESC as embryoid bodies (EBs) that can be identified and sorted using FACS (purity>95%, viability>85%). The eGFP-expressing cells were stained positively for cardiac-specific proteins (>93%), expressed cardiac-specific genes, displayed cardiac-specific action-potentials, and could form stable myocardial cell grafts following in vivo cell transplantation. The generation of these transgenic hESC lines may be used to identify and study early cardiac precursors for developmental studies, to robustly quantify the extent of cardiomyocyte differentiation, to label the cells for in vivo grafting, and to allow derivation of purified cell populations of cardiomyocytes for future myocardial cell therapy strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2130719768,"Selenium is an essential micronutrient that suppresses the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory gene expression. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory property of selenium, we examined the activity of a key kinase of the NF-κB cascade, IκB-kinase β (IKKβ) subunit, as a function of cellular selenium status in murine primary bone marrow-derived macrophages and RAW264.7 macrophage-like cell line. In vitro kinase assays revealed that selenium supplementation decreased the activity of IKKβ in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated macrophages. Stimulation by LPS of selenium-supplemented macrophages resulted in a time-dependent increase in 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) formation, an endogenous inhibitor of IKKβ activity. Further analysis revealed that inhibition of IKKβ activity in selenium-supplemented cells correlated with the Michael addition product of 15d-PGJ2 with Cys-179 of IKKβ, while the formation of such an adduct was significantly decreased in the selenium-deficient macrophages. In addition, anti-inflammatory activities of selenium were also mediated by the 15d-PGJ2-dependent activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptor-γ in macrophages. Experiments using specific cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors and genetic knockdown approaches indicated that COX-1, and not the COX-2 pathway, was responsible for the increased synthesis of 15d-PGJ2 in selenium-supplemented macrophages. Taken together, our results suggest that selenium supplementation increases the production of 15d-PGJ2 as an adaptive response to protect cells against oxidative stress-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression. More specifically, modification of protein thiols by 15d-PGJ2 represents a previously undescribed code for redox regulation of gene expression by selenium.

Macrophages play central roles as effector cells in inflammatory reactions and cell-mediated immune responses. While performing these functions, these cells produce such reactive oxygen species in the form of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl, and lipid peroxyl radicals along with a great number of pro-inflammatory substances, including complement components, PGs, 3The abbreviations used are: PG, prostaglandin; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; COX, cyclooxygenase; IKKβ, IκB-kinase β; 15d-PGJ2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; H-PGDS, hematopoietic PGD2 synthase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BMDM, bone marrow-derived macrophage; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GW9662, 2-chloro-5-nitro-N-phenylbenzamide; HQL-79, 4-(diphenylmethoxy)-1-[3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)propylpiperidine]; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. chemokines, and cytokines like interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (1Speer C.P. Gahr M. Monatsschr. Kinderheilkd. 1989; 137: 390-395PubMed Google Scholar). Such reactions represent a potentially toxic insult, which if not counteracted, will lead to membrane dysfunction, DNA damage and inactivation of proteins, leading to the onset and/or progression of many disease pathologies (2Halliwell B. Guteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar, 3Spector A. J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 16: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4Toyokuni S. Pathol. Int. 1999; 49: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In contrast to the conventional dogma that reactive oxygen species are mostly triggers for oxidative damage of biological structures, it is now increasingly clear that physiologically relevant concentrations of reactive oxygen species can regulate a variety of key molecular pathways that may be linked with important cell functions, including gene expression (5Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). Regulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species levels is accomplished by a complex multitier antioxidant system, which plays an important regulatory role in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (6Rojas A. Figueroa H. Morales M.A. Re L. Curr. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2006; 4: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The antioxidant capacity of cells, including macrophages, is therefore, very important not only to maintain its own vital function in its defense but also to tightly control the intracellular oxidative tone. In the multitier antioxidant system, micronutrient selenium plays a major role mainly in the form of selenoproteins (7Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin reductases and glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) represent two well studied classes of selenoenzymes that catalyze the reduction of cellular peroxides and help in maintaining an optimal redox balance in cells (8Burk R.F. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 45: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The activity of selenoenzymes is directly proportional to the total plasma selenium (9Allan C.B. Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, in many disease states, including HIV and many cancers, the activity of selenoenzymes is reduced leading to inflammation and decreased immune function (10Foster H.D. Med. Hypotheses. 2004; 62: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In recent years, the role of selenium in preventing human disease has gained new attention following the association of “super supplementation” with decreased incidences of prostate cancer in a few preliminary studies (11Gasparian A.V. Yao Y.J. Lu J. Yemelyanov A.Y. Lyakh L.A. Slaga T.J. Budunova I.V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1079-1087PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vogt T.M. Ziegler R.G. Graubard B.I. Swanson C.A. Greenberg R.S. Schoenberg J.B. Swanson G.M. Hayes R.B. Mayne S.T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 20: 664-670Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Sonn G.A. Aronson W. Litwin M.S. Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis. 2005; 8: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that selenium prevents malignant transformation of cells by serving as a “redox switch” through its role in catalyzing oxidation-reduction reactions of critical thiol groups or disulfide bonds, possibly through selenoproteins (14Hadley K.B. Sunde R.A. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2001; 12: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Tamura T. Stadtman T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown selenium to be a potent regulator of transcription pathways. In fact, selenium deficiency in human Jurkat and lung carcinoma cells increased the nuclear binding and transcriptional activation of oxidative-stress responsive genes by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (16Kim I.Y. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12904-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Along the same lines, studies in our laboratory have shown that selenium supplementation of macrophages decreased the expression of two pro-inflammatory genes, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase, via the inactivation of NF-κB, whereas the expression of COX-1 was unaffected (17Zamamiri-Davis F. Lu Y. Thompson J.T. Prabhu K.S. Reddy P.V. Sordillo L.M. Reddy C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Prabhu K.S. Zamamiri-Davis F. Stewart J.B. Thompson J.T. Sordillo L.M. Reddy C.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 203-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that signaling pathways activated by ligation of cell surface pattern recognition receptors converge at the IκB kinase (IKK) complex that phosphorylates the inhibitory subunit and cytoplasmic retention protein of the NF-κB complex, IκBα (19Ausubel F.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The IKK complex includes highly homologous catalytic kinases, IKKα (IKK1), IKKβ (IKK2), and an essential regulatory subunit, also known as IKKγ or NEMO (20Ducut Sigala J.L. Bottero V. Young D.B. Shevchenko A. Mercurio F. Verma I.M. Science. 2004; 304: 1963-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although both IKKα and IKKβ can phosphorylate all three IκB proteins in vitro, studies in mice that are deficient in IKK subunits show that, in most cells, IKKβ has the dominant role in signal-induced phosphorylation and degradation of these proteins (21Karin M. Yamamoto Y. Wang Q.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 22Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation by upstream kinases, the enzymatic activity of IKKβ is subjected to further control by Michael adduct formation with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, 4-hydroxynonenal (23Ji C. Kozak K.R. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18223-18228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or cyclopentenone PGs such as PGA1 and 15d-PGJ2, with a critical cysteine (Cys-179) residue in the activation loop (24Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition of NF-κB activation, by these endogenous compounds, could play a seminal role in the resolution of immune response. In addition, 15d-PGJ2 has been shown to directly bind and activate the nuclear hormone receptor PPARγ (25Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar), which can trans-repress the inflammatory responses mediated by NF-κB (26Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar, 27Bailey S.T. Ghosh S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 966-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Pascual G. Fong A.L. Ogawa S. Gamliel A. Li A.C. Perissi V. Rose D.W. Willson T.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 2005; 437: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Therefore, cellular production of 15d-PGJ2 may mediate anti-inflammatory responses via these pathways. However, there are no reports on the preferential increase in the intracellular levels of 15d-PGJ2 to support these claims. Here, we show for the first time that selenium supplementation of macrophages leads to the preferential increase in 15d-PGJ2 via the arachidonic acid oxidation by COX-1, rather than COX-2. In macrophages and other immune cells, PGH2 is further converted to PGD2 by the hematopoietic PGD2 synthase (H-PGDS) that undergoes two spontaneous non-enzymatic dehydration reactions to form 15d-PGJ2 (29Shibata T. Kondo M. Osawa T. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10459-10466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The present study is based on the hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory role of selenium occurs, in part, via 15d-PGJ2-dependent intracellular signaling pathways in macrophages and that COX-1 plays a pivotal role in the control of NF-κB activity. Reagents—Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), sodium selenite, and GW9662 were from Sigma. Anti-COX-1, anti-COX-2, COX inhibitors, indomethacin, SC-560 (for COX-1), and CAY10404 (for COX-2) were obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Antibodies for IKKα, pIκBα, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and p65 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-IKKβ was from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Anti-15d-PGJ2 was from Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI). Goat anti-rabbit IgG, anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, polyvinylidene difluoride, and West Pico chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from Pierce. Mouse IKKβ-(173–186) was synthesized at the Macromolecular core facility, Pennsylvania State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA. Cell Culture and Stimulation—The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (ATCC) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% defined fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 80 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with a 5% CO2/air mixture. Total selenium in the fetal bovine serum was quantitated to be 6 pmol/ml. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium either supplemented with selenium (2 nmol/ml of media) or without any added as described from our laboratory (17Zamamiri-Davis F. Lu Y. Thompson J.T. Prabhu K.S. Reddy P.V. Sordillo L.M. Reddy C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cell viability and growth rates of selenium-supplemented cells were similar to their selenium-deficient counterparts. The enzymatic activity was used as a marker of cellular selenium status (9Allan C.B. Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). About 1 × 106 selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented cells were seeded in a 6-well plate, and then cultured in respective media for ∼24 h to allow the cell number to approximately double. Cells were stimulated with LPS (0–1 μg/ml) and/or other compounds for the indicated time periods. Upon treatment, the cells were harvested, washed with cold sterile PBS and stored at –80 °C until further use. Femoral bone marrow plugs, from mice maintained on a selenium-deficient or a selenium-supplemented diet, were isolated, and adherent cells, hereafter referred to as primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), were differentiated in their respective media containing 20% L929 fibroblast media supernatant (as a source of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) for 1 week. The L929 cells were also cultured under selenium-deficient or selenium-supplemented conditions. The selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented diets were formulated based on an American Institute of Nutrition recommended rodent diet containing 0.01 or 0.4 ppm of selenium, as described (30Moskovitz J. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7486-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The diets were purchased from Zeigler (Gardners, PA). The BMDM cultures from selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented mice were used in all experiments. LPS Treatment of Mice—Selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented mice (n = 3 in each category) were treated with Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4 LPS (at 5 mg/kg body weight) or PBS control by intraperitoneal injection. The mice were euthanized after 6 h of injection. The serum from each mouse was prepared and used in 15d-PGJ2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as described later in this section. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Preparation of Cell Lysates—The frozen cell pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of mammalian protein extraction reagent (M-PER, Pierce) containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonic acid for 30 min on ice with intermittent vortexing. Supernatants were prepared by centrifuging the cell lysate at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and used for analyses. Protein concentration in the cell supernatants was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Thirty micrograms of protein from RAW264.7 or BMDM cell lysates was separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described (31Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Vunta H. Reddy C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk (w/v). The membrane was probed with primary antibody followed by an appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates (∼30–50 μg of protein) from LPS-treated and untreated selenium-deficient or selenium-supplemented RAW264.7 and BMDMs were used with IKKα- (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or IKKβ-specific IgG (Imgenex). The immunoprecipitated IKK·IgG complex was pulled down using Protein A/G-Sepharose (GE Amersham Biosciences) and used in Western blot analysis, as described above, or in vitro kinase assays, as described below. The membrane was probed with anti-15d-PGJ2. [14C]Arachidonic Acid Treatment of Macrophages—The selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with [1-14C]arachidonic acid (1 μCi and 30 μm, American Radiochemicals, St. Louis, MO) for 2 h prior to stimulation with LPS for 1 h. The cell lysates were used to isolate IKKβ by immunoprecipitation, as described earlier, and analyzed on an SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The blots were reprobed for IKKβ to confirm near-equal immunoprecipitation. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Cell lysates for in vitro kinase assays were prepared using the lysis buffer as described (32Carcamo J.M. Pedraza A. Borquez-Ojeda O. Golde D.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12995-13002Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the case of IKK, the cell lysate (∼30–50 μg of protein) was incubated with GST-IκBα and ATP for 1 h in the kinase wash buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 100 μm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) at 25 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was centrifuged. The pellet was washed three times with sterile PBS. The phospho-labeled GST-IκBα was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was probed with anti-phosphoserine (Sigma). Furthermore, to quantitate the activity, immunoprecipitated IKKα or IKKβ was incubated with [32P]ATP (2 μCi, Amersham Biosciences) and GST-IκBα fusion protein as described (32Carcamo J.M. Pedraza A. Borquez-Ojeda O. Golde D.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12995-13002Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was subjected to gel-filtration chromatography using the Bio-Gel P30 pre-packed columns (Bio-Rad). The flow-through, which contained the GST-[32P]IκBα, was subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Chemical Treatments—Selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented RAW264.7 and BMDM cells (1 × 106) were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate and treated with 1 μm indomethacin or SC-560 to inhibit COX-1. 10 nm CAY10404 was used as a COX-2-specific inhibitor. In all cases, the treatment with inhibitors (for 24 h) was followed by stimulation with LPS for the indicated time periods. The cell lysates were prepared as described earlier and subjected to Western immunoblot analyses, in vitro kinase assays, while the media supernatants were used for 15d-PGJ2 assays. An irreversible PPARγ antagonist, 2-chloro-5-nitro-N-phenylbenzamide (GW9662, 1 μm) was used in some studies to determine the specific role of 15d-PGJ2-dependent activation of PPARγ. The cells were pretreated with GW9662 for 12 h prior to LPS stimulation. To inhibit the activity of H-PGDS, selenium-supplemented cells were pretreated with 50 μm 4-(diphenylmethoxy)-1-[3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)propylpiperidine] (HQL-79, Cayman), prior to LPS stimulation for 12 h. Supernatants were used in 15d-PGJ2 analysis as described below. All chemical treatment studies included an appropriate Me2SO4 vehicle control. Quantitation of PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2—A 96-well-based enzyme immunoassay kit, from both Cayman Chemicals and Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI), was used to quantitate PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2, respectively. The concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 in culture media supernatants of RAW264.7 and BMDM in the presence or absence of LPS (0–1 μg/ml) for various time periods were determined by enzyme immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to total cellular protein. PGD2 was derivatized using methoximylamine-HCl as per the recommendation of the supplier. Standard calibration curves were prepared using PGD2 methoxime or 15d-PGJ2 and fitted to a log-linear, logit, multiway frequency regression analysis. PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 were quantitated in cell lysates and normalized to total protein in the cell lysates. LC-MS Analysis of 15d-PGJ2 Production—Culture media supernatants from LPS-stimulated selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented macrophages were acidified with 2 n HCl and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were processed using a C18-Sep-Pak column cartridge (Waters), and bound 15d-PGJ2 was eluted with methanol, evaporated, and stored in ethyl acetate at –80 °C until further analysis. As an internal control to calculate extraction efficiency, 200 ng of deuterated 15d-PGJ2(d4) (Cayman Chemicals) was added to the supernatants before extraction. The 15d-PGJ2 was resolved on a Restek Ultra Aqueous C18 (5 μm, 250 mm × 2.1 mm) high-performance liquid chromatography column (Bellefonte, PA) on an aqueous acetonitrile gradient with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. MS analysis was performed on a Micromass ZMD mass spectrometer (Waters) set to scan mode (m/z 200–400) for authentic standards, whereas selective ion monitoring set to m/z 317 (M-H+) and 321 (M-H+) for 15d-PGJ2(d0) and 15d-PGJ2(d4), respectively, was used for quantitation in the samples. Standard calibration curves for 15d-PGJ2(d0) and 15d-PGJ2(d4) were set up for the quantitation and calculations were performed based on the following: b(0) = 6545.09, b(1) = 25.51, and r2 = 0.99 (for d0) and b(0) = 253.48, b(1) = 79.646, and r2 = 0.98 (for d4). Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Post-translational Modification of IKKβ—To further confirm the modification of IKKβ by 15d-PGJ2 and support the immunoprecipitation studies, murine IKKβ peptide-(173–186), LDQGSLCTSFVGTL, was incubated with Me2SO, authentic 15d-PGJ2 (mol/mol), or total lipid extract from selenium-supplemented macrophages (LPS-treated for 2 h) for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS. The samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS for modification. Transient Transfection Assays—Murine COX-2 gene promoter (–2000 to +75) and its NF-κB double mutant in pGL3 luciferase vector were prepared as described (17Zamamiri-Davis F. Lu Y. Thompson J.T.

The plasmid constructs were transfected into RAW264.7 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as per the instructions of the supplier (Roche Applied Science). To normalize the transfection efficiency, β-galactosidase activity from the pSV-βGal (Promega, Madison, WI) plasmid and total protein were used. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS for 4 h post-transfection. Cell lysates were prepared as described above, and the luciferase activity was read in a Turner plate luminometer. siRNA Experiments—The siRNA target sequence for murine COX-1 mRNA was designed using the Dharmacon siGENOME™ design tool available online. The 21-base siRNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Dharmacon and annealed according to the manufacturer's specifications. For transfection, RAW264.7 or BMDM was seeded into 6-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well) without gentamicin. After 24 h, cells were transfected with siRNA duplex using TransIT®-siQUEST™ (Mirus Bio Corp.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. siRNA duplexes were used at a final concentration of 200 pmol/well. To ensure maximum effect, a second transfection was performed after 4 h, and the cells were allowed to recover for an additional 8 h before treatment with LPS. Cells and media supernatants from LPS-treated (12 h) or untreated cells were collected for 15d-PGJ2 quantitation, whereas the corresponding cell lysates were used for IKKβ activity and Western immunoblot analyses. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts for Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—For electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments, nuclear proteins were isolated as described previously from our laboratory (31Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Vunta H. Reddy C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences of the sense strand of double-stranded oligonucleotides specific for NF-κB and PPARγ were 5′-GATCCAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ and 5′-GGTGAGGAGGGGAAGGGTCAGTGTG-3′, respectively. Complementary strands were annealed, and double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol and 10 mCi/ml) using the T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Five micrograms of nuclear proteins was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in a binding buffer specific for NF-κB (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol) or PPARγ (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.175 mm EDTA, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). The extracts were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 10,000 cpm of 32P-labeled NF-κB or PPARγ probes. The samples were analyzed as described earlier from our laboratory. NF-κBor PPARγ bands were confirmed by competition with a 100-fold excess of the respective unlabeled probe. Differential Selenium Status in Macrophages—Culturing of RAW264.7 cells in the presence or absence of selenium, as well as primary BMDMs isolated and differentiated from mice maintained on selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented diets, yielded cell populations that exhibited differential selenium status as seen by cytosolic GPX activity levels (Fig. 1, A and B). A 6-fold difference in the cytosolic GPX activity in the selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented BMDM was seen. Along the same lines, liver homogenates from selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented mice demonstrated a 7-fold difference in the enzymatic activity of cytosolic GPX (data not shown). In the case of RAW264.7 macrophages, a difference of ∼12-fold was seen between the two groups (Fig. 1B). The results of differences in GPX activity are consistent with those previously reported in RAW264.7 macrophages from our laboratory (17Zamamiri-Davis F. Lu Y. Thompson J.T. Prabhu K.S. Reddy P.V. Sordillo L.M. Reddy C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of GPX1 were also found to be significantly different in the two groups in that the selenium-supplemented cells demonstrated a higher level of GPX1 expression compared with the selenium-deficient cells (data not shown). Accordingly, the selenium-supplemented and selenium-deficient BMDM and RAW264.7 macrophages were used in all the experiments described below. Selenium Deficiency Exacerbates COX-2 Expression via Increased Levels of pIκBα Leading to the Activation of NF-κB—Stimulation of selenium-deficient RAW264.7 and BMDM cells with LPS for 0–24 h clearly demonstrated exacerbated expression of COX-2 when compared with those cultured in the presence of selenium (Fig. 2, A and B). The differences in expression were obvious as early as 30 min of stimulation of cells (Fig. 2B). Previous reports from our laboratory have indicated that NF-κB is a key transcription factor in the regulation of COX-2 expression in selenium-deficient cells (17Zamamiri-Davis F. Lu Y. Thompson J.T. Prabhu K.S. Reddy P.V. Sordillo L.M. Reddy C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To further understand the role of selenium on the NF-κB-dependent transcription of COX-2, we mutated the two NF-κB sites in the promoter of murine COX-2. As seen in Fig. 2C, the transient transfection studies with wild-type mouse COX-2 promoter luciferase reporter exhibited a 4- to 5-fold increase in activity in selenium-deficient RAW264.7 cells, whereas there was no increase noted in the NF-κB double mutant reporter.

https://openalex.org/W2034968362,"Although butein (3,4,2′,4′-tetrahydroxychalcone) is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-fibrogenic activities, very little is known about its mechanism of action. Because numerous effects modulated by butein can be linked to interference with the NF-κB pathway, we investigated in detail the effect of this chalcone on NF-κB activity. As examined by DNA binding, we found that butein suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-κB activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner; suppressed the NF-κB activation induced by various inflammatory agents and carcinogens; and inhibited the NF-κB reporter activity induced by TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, TAK1/TAB1, and IKK-β. We also found that butein blocked the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα by inhibiting IκBα kinase (IKK) activation. We found the inactivation of IKK by butein was direct and involved cysteine residue 179. This correlated with the suppression of phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of p65. In this study, butein also inhibited the expression of the NF-κB-regulated gene products involved in anti-apoptosis (IAP2, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL), proliferation (cyclin D1 and c-Myc), and invasion (COX-2 and MMP-9). Suppression of these gene products correlated with enhancement of the apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic agents; and inhibition of cytokine-induced cellular invasion. Overall, our results indicated that antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities previously assigned to butein may be mediated in part through the direct inhibition of IKK, leading to the suppression of the NF-κB activation pathway.

Most of the currently available targeted therapies for age-associated chronic illnesses are not very effective, exhibit numerous side effects, and for more than 80% of the population of the world, are too expensive. Thus alternates, which are less expensive, more efficacious, and exhibit minimum toxicity, are needed.

Because butein exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects and suppresses the expression of adhesion molecules, iNOS, Bcl-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and 12-lipooxygenase, all of which are known to be regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB, we postulated that butein must mediate its effects by modulating the NF-κB activation pathway, which has been closely linked to inflammation, tumorigenesis, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and is activated in response to various inflammatory agents, carcinogens, tumor promoters, and growth factors (37Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 38Aggarwal B.B. Shishodia S. Sandur S.K. Pandey M.K. Sethi G. Biochem.

Therefore, the effect of butein on the regulation of this pathway was investigated in detail. We found that butein suppressed NF-κB activation pathways activated by a variety of agents through the direct inhibition of IκBα kinase (IKK), which led to the suppression of NF-κB-regulated gene products and the enhancement of apoptosis induced by inflammatory cytokines. Reagents—Butein, with chemical structure as shown in Fig. 1A was obtained from Alexis (San Diego, CA). A 50 mm solution of butein was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide, stored as small aliquots at –20 °C, and then diluted as needed in cell culture medium. Bacteria-derived human recombinant human TNF, purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5 × 107 units/mg, was kindly provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Cigarette smoke condensate, prepared as previously described (40Anto R.J. Mukhopadhyay A. Shishodia S. Gairola C.G. Aggarwal B.B. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was supplied by Dr. C. Gary Gairola (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). Penicillin, streptomycin, RPMI 1640 medium, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen.

Antibodies against p65, p50, IκBα, cyclin D1, pro-caspase-8, pro-caspase-3, JNK1, p38 MAPK, MMP-9, c-Myc, ICAM-1, IAP2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, RIP, TRADD, and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the annexin V staining kits were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-VEGF was obtained from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). Anti-COX-2 antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences. Phosphospecific anti-IκBα (Ser-32/36) and phospho-specific anti-p65 antibodies (Ser-536), cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, and phospho-p38 MAPK were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-IKK-α and anti-IKK-β antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Expression vector plasmids for transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase (TAK1) and TAK1 binding protein (TAB1) have been described previously (41Blonska M. Shambharkar P.B. Kobayashi M. Zhang D. Sakurai H. Su B. Lin X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43056-43063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). IKK plasmids with mutated cysteine residue 179 (Cys-179) were kindly provided by Dr. T. D. Gilmore of Boston University (Boston, MA). Cell Lines—Cell lines H1299 (human lung adenocarcinoma), KBM-5 (human myeloid), Jurkat (human T cell leukemia) cells and A293 (human embryonic kidney) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The H1299 and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, KBM-5 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 15% fetal bovine serum, and A293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. All culture media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To determine NF-κB activation, we prepared nuclear extracts and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described previously (42Chaturvedi M.M. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 319: 585-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For supershift assays, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with antibodies against either p50 or p65 of NF-κB for 30 min at 37 °C before the complex was analyzed by EMSA. Preimmune serum was included as the negative control. The dried gels were visualized, and the radioactive bands were quantitated with a Storm 820 imaging system running ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—To determine the effect of butein on TNF-dependent IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, p65 translocation, and p65 phosphorylation, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (43Reddy S.A. Chaturvedi M.M. Darnay B.G. Chan H. Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25369-25372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Shishodia S. Majumdar S. Banerjee S. Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4375-4383PubMed Google Scholar). For the detection of cleavage products of PARP, caspases, antiapoptotic, and angiogenesis markers, whole cell extracts were prepared by subjecting TNF and TNF plus butein-treated cells to lysis in lysis buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mmol/liter NaCl, 2 mmol/liter EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.005 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 mmol/liter NaVO4). Lysates were spun at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble material. Supernatants were collected and kept at –80 °C. Either cytosolic, or nuclear extracts and whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with the relevant antibodies, and detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences ECL™). The bands obtained were quantified using NIH Image analyzer (NIH, Bethesda, MD). For detection of precapases and cleaved caspases, specific antibodies against each were combined for detection. Kinase Assay—To determine the effect of butein on TNF-induced IKK activation, we performed an immunocomplex kinase assay using GST-IκBα as the substrate as described previously (45Manna S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4927-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IKK complex from whole cell extracts was precipitated with antibody against IKK-α and treated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). After 2 h, the beads were washed with whole cell extract buffer and then resuspended in a kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 20 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μg of substrate GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–54). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized with the Storm 820 imaging system. To determine the total amounts of IKK-α and IKK-β in each sample, 30 μg of whole cell proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with either anti-IKK-α or anti-IKK-β antibody. For JNK assay, whole cell extracts were precipitated with antibody against JNK1, and performed kinase assay using GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) as described (46Takada Y. Kobayashi Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17203-17212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To determine the amount of JNK1 in each sample, Western blotting was performed against JNK1 antibody. NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Expression Assay—To determine the effect of butein on TNF-, TNF receptor (TNFR-), TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD-), TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2-), NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), TAK1/TAB1-, and IKK-NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription, we performed the secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) assay as previously described (47Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), with the following exceptions. Briefly, A293 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method with pNF-κB-SEAP (0.5 μg). To examine TNF-induced reporter gene expression, we transfected the cells with 0.5 μg of the SEAP expression plasmid and 1.5 μg of the control plasmid pCMV-FLAG1 DNA for 24 h. We then treated the cells for 4 h with butein and stimulated them with 1 nm TNF. The cell culture medium was harvested after 24 h of TNF treatment. To examine reporter gene expression induced by various genes, A293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pNF-κB-SEAP plasmid with 0.5 μg of an expressing plasmid and 1.5 μgofthe control plasmid pCMV-FLAG1 for 24 h, treated with butein, and then harvested from cell culture medium after an additional 24 h of incubation. The culture medium was analyzed for SEAP activity as recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech) using a Victor 3 microplate reader (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). Immunocytochemistry for NF-κB p65 Localization—Immunocytochemistry was used to examine the effect of butein on the nuclear pools of p65 as previously described (48Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Briefly, treated cells were plated on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide by centrifugation (Cytospin 4; Thermoshendon), air dried, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After being washed in phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human p65 antibody at a 1/200 dilution. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the slides were washed, incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 594 antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a 1/200 dilution for 1 h, and counterstained for nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (50 ng/ml) for 5 min. Stained slides were mounted with mounting medium (Sigma) and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2; Nikon). Pictures were captured using a Photometrics Coolsnap CF color camera (Nikon) and MetaMorph version 4.6.5 software (Universal Imaging). Live/Dead Assay—To measure apoptosis, we also used the Live/Dead assay (Molecular Probes), which determines intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity (49Takada Y. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15096-15104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Calcein-AM, a nonfluorescent polyanionic dye, is retained by live cells, in which it produces intense green fluorescence through enzymatic (esterase) conversion. In addition, the ethidium homodimer enters cells with damaged membranes and binds to nucleic acids, thereby producing a bright red fluorescence in dead cells. Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were incubated with 25 μm butein for 4 h and treated with 1 nm TNF up to 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were stained with the Live/Dead reagent (5 μm ethidium homodimer and 5 μm calcein-AM) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2; Nikon). Cytotoxicity Assay—The effects of butein on the cytotoxic effects of TNF and other chemotherapeutic agents were determined by the MTT uptake method as previously described (48Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5,000 cells were incubated with 25 μm butein in triplicate in a 96-well plate and treated with the indicated concentrations of 1 nm TNF, 0.1 μm 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and 0.1 μm doxorubicin for 24 h at 37 °C. An MTT solution was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. An extraction buffer (20% SDS, 50% dimethyl formamide) was added, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Then the optical density was measured at 570 nm using a 96-well multiscanner (MRX Revelation, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Annexin V Assay—The annexin V assay uses the binding properties of annexin V to detect the rapid translocation and accumulation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidyl-serine from the cytoplasmic membrane interface to the extracellular surface, an indicator of early apoptosis. We detected this loss of membrane asymmetry using an annexin V antibody conjugated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence dye. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were pretreated with butein (25 μm), treated with 1 nm TNF up to 16 h at 37 °C, and subjected to annexin V staining. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-annexin V antibody, and analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Invasion Assay—This assay was performed mostly as previously described (50Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Because invasion through the extracellular matrix is a crucial step in tumor metastasis, a membrane invasion culture system was used to assess cell invasion. The BD BioCoat tumor invasion system consists of chambers with a lightproof polyethylene terephthalate membrane coated with a reconstituted basement membrane gel with 8-μm diameter pores (BD Biosciences). We suspended 2.5 × 104 non-small cell adenocarcinoma H1299 cells in serum-free medium and seeded the upper wells with them. After incubation overnight, the cells were treated with the indicated concentration of butein for 4 h and stimulated with 1 nm TNF for an additional 24 h in the presence of 1% fetal bovine serum. The cells that invaded the lower chamber by migrating through the Matrigel during incubation were stained with 4 μg/ml calcein-AM in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C and scanned for fluorescence with a Victor 3 multiplate reader (PerkinElmer); fluorescent cells were counted. We investigated the effects of butein on the NF-κB activation pathway induced by various carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli, on NF-κB-regulated gene expression, and on apoptosis induced by cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents. The concentration of butein used and the duration of exposure had minimal effect on the viability of different cell lines studied as determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test (data not shown). We focused on TNF-induced NF-κB activation because the NF-κB activation pathway activated by TNF has been relatively well characterized (51Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Butein Suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB Activation in a Dose- and Time-dependent Manner—We first determined the dose and time of exposure to butein required to suppress TNF-induced NF-κB activation. For this cells were first pretreated with butein, then exposed to TNF for NF-κB activation. EMSA showed that butein alone had no effect on NF-κB activation, but it inhibited TNF-mediated NF-κB activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively). Whether butein can suppress NF-κB in cells pre-activated with TNF was also determined. We found that butein down-regulated quite effectively TNF induced NF-κB even when cells were treated with the inhibitor after NF-κB activation (see lane 3 versus lane 5 in Fig. 1D). NF-κB is a complex of proteins, in which various combinations of Rel/NF-κB proteins constitute active NF-κB heterodimers that bind to a specific DNA sequence. Thus, to show that the band visualized by EMSA in TNF-treated cells was indeed NF-κB, nuclear extracts from TNF-activated cells were incubated with antibodies to the p50 (NF-κB) and p65 (RelA) subunits of NF-κB and analyzed by EMSA. The results in Fig. 1E, showed the bands had shifted to higher molecular masses suggesting that the TNF-activated complex consisted of p50 and p65. Preimmune serum had no effect on DNA binding. The addition of excess unlabeled NF-κB (cold oligonucleotide; 100-fold) caused a complete disappearance of the band, whereas the addition of mutated oligonucleotide had no effect on the DNA binding. Butein Inhibits Constitutive NF-κB Activation—Whether butein alone could inhibit constitutive NF-κB in tumor cells was also investigated. Multiple myeloma U266 cells are known to express constitutive NF-κB activation (52Bharti A.C. Shishodia S. Reuben J.M. Weber D. Alexanian R. RajVadhan S. Estrov Z. Talpaz M. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2004; 103: 3175-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). U266 cells were treated with different concentrations of butein for 4 h and then analyzed for NF-κB activation. Butein inhibited the constitutive NF-κB activation in MM cells (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that butein can suppress not only inducible but also constitutively active NF-κB in tumor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2090614253,"Osteopontin (Opn) is important for T helper type 1 (T(H)1) immunity and autoimmunity. However, the role of this cytokine in T(H)2-mediated allergic disease as well as its effects on primary versus secondary antigenic encounters remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that OPN is expressed in the lungs of asthmatic individuals and that Opn-s, the secreted form of Opn, exerts opposing effects on mouse T(H)2 effector responses and subsequent allergic airway disease: pro-inflammatory at primary systemic sensitization, and anti-inflammatory during secondary pulmonary antigenic challenge. These effects of Opn-s are mainly mediated by the regulation of T(H)2-suppressing plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) during primary sensitization and T(H)2-promoting conventional DCs during secondary antigenic challenge. Therapeutic administration of recombinant Opn during pulmonary secondary antigenic challenge decreased established T(H)2 responses and protected mice from allergic disease. These effects on T(H)2 allergic responses suggest that Opn-s is an important therapeutic target and provide new insight into its role in immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1964327488,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snf1 protein kinase, a member of the Snf1/AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) family, has important roles in metabolic control, particularly in response to nutrient stress. Here we have addressed the role of Snf1 in responses to other environmental stresses. Exposure of cells to sodium ion stress, alkaline pH, or oxidative stress caused an increase in Snf1 catalytic activity and phosphorylation of Thr-210 in the activation loop, whereas treatment with sorbitol or heat shock did not. Inhibition of respiratory metabolism by addition of antimycin A to cells also increased Snf1 activity. Analysis of mutants indicated that the kinases Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1, which activate Snf1 in response to glucose limitation, are also required under other stress conditions. Each kinase sufficed for activation in response to stress, but Sak1 had the major role. In sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ cells expressing mammalian Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase α, Snf1 was activated by both sodium ion and alkaline stress, suggesting that stress signals regulate Snf1 activity by a mechanism that is independent of the upstream kinase. Finally, we showed that Snf1 protein kinase is regulated differently during adaptation of cells to NaCl and alkaline pH with respect to both temporal regulation of activation and subcellular localization. Snf1 protein kinase becomes enriched in the nucleus in response to alkaline pH but not salt stress. Such differences could contribute to specificity of the stress responses.

Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar). In mammals, AMPK regulates glucose and lipid metabolism and is involved in regulating the energy balance both at the cellular and whole body levels. AMPK is activated by hormones, including leptin and adiponectin, and by stresses that cause depletion of cellular ATP and hence elevation of the AMP:ATP ratio, including glucose deprivation, exercise, hypoxia, ischemia, heat shock, oxidative stress, and metabolic poisons such as inhibitors of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory chain (2Kahn B.B.

Hyperosmotic stress also activates AMPK, although exposure of cells to sorbitol does not appear to increase the cellular AMP:ATP ratio (5Fryer L.G. Parbu-Patel A. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25226-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Snf1 protein kinase similarly has important functions in metabolic control. Snf1 protein kinase is required for the adaptation of yeast cells to glucose limitation and for growth on carbon sources that are less preferred than glucose, such as sucrose (hence the name Snf, for sucrose-nonfermenting) and nonfermentable carbon sources (6Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The kinase is activated by glucose limitation (7Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J.

Snf1 protein kinase has also been implicated in responses to starvation for other nutrients besides carbon, notably nitrogen (13Thompson-Jaeger S. Francois J. Gaughran J.P. Tatchell K.

Chevalier A. Mann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2560-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, snf1Δ mutant cultures show reduced thermotolerance in the stationary phase (13Thompson-Jaeger S. Francois J. Gaughran J.P. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1991; 129: 697-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Snf1 has been shown to affect transcription of stress-responsive genes such as ENA1, encoding Na+-ATPase; the snf1Δ mutant is defective in induction of ENA1 in response to alkaline or sodium ion stress (25Ye T. Garcia-Salcedo R. Ramos J. Hohmann S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Platara M. Ruiz A. Serrano R. Palomino A. Moreno F. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36632-36642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when cells are starved for glucose, Snf1 also promotes induction of ENA1 (26Alepuz P.M. Cunningham K.W. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), activates heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 (29Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a role for Snf1 in the regulation of protective mechanisms against various stresses in response to glucose depletion. Three upstream kinases, Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1, phosphorylate Thr-210 in the activation segment of the Snf1 catalytic subunit (33Hong S.-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 34Sutherland C.M. Hawley S.A. McCartney R.R. Leech A. Stark M.J. Schmidt M.C. Hardie D.G. Curr.

Biol. 2003; 23: 3909-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking all three kinases do not activate Snf1 in response to glucose limitation. Evidence suggests that the three kinases make different contributions to cellular regulation under conditions of different carbon source availability; however, in all cases tested, Sak1 was the major player (36Hedbacker K. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37McCartney R.R. Rubenstein E.M. Schmidt M.C. Curr.

It remains possible that the other two kinases are more prominently involved in responses to other types of stress besides carbon stress. In this paper, we have addressed the role of Snf1 protein kinase in the response to environmental stresses, including ionic, hyperosmotic, and oxidative stress, alkaline pH, and heat shock. To determine whether Snf1 is activated by stress, we assayed Snf1 activity and phosphorylation of Thr-210 after exposure of cells to various stress conditions, and we examined the subcellular localization of Snf1 protein kinase. We have also addressed the roles of the Snf1-activating kinases Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1 in stress responses. Strains and Media—S. cerevisiae strains were derivatives of W303-1A (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 ura3 ade2 can1) and W303-1B (MATα trp1 leu2 his3 ura3 ade2 can1). Relevant mutant alleles were sak1Δ::KanMX4, tos3Δ::KanMX4, elm1Δ::KanMX4, elm1Δ::ADE2, and elm1Δ::URA3. The hog1::LEU2 allele (39Bilsland-Marchesan E. Arino J. Saito H. Sunnerhagen P. Posas F. Mol.

Yeast cultures were grown in yeast extract-peptone (YEP) containing 2% dextrose (YPD) at 30 °C unless otherwise specified. For cells carrying a plasmid, cultures were grown in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil and containing 2% dextrose. To prepare liquid medium at alkaline pH, medium containing 0.1 m HEPES was adjusted to the desired pH with 5 m NaOH. To prepare solid medium at alkaline pH, 4× YPD containing 0.4 m HEPES was adjusted to the desired pH at room temperature and was then mixed with agar precooled to 50 °C. Assay of Snf1 Catalytic Activity by Phosphorylation of SAMS Peptide—Cultures were grown to exponential phase (A600 of 1.0) in YPD, and cells (100 ml) were harvested by filtration. The filter was immediately transferred to the appropriate media, and cells were resuspended, incubated for the indicated time, and harvested again by filtration. Cells were then scraped from the filter and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. In the case of oxidative stress, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 30% v/v) was added to the YPD culture to the indicated final concentration, and the culture was incubated for 5 min before harvesting. Cell extracts were prepared as described (36Hedbacker K. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Mol. Cell.

Kinase activity is expressed as nmol of phosphate incorporated into the peptide per min per mg of protein (40Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins (2 μg) were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-Thr-172-AMPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies). Before the membrane was reprobed with anti-Snf1 antibody (6Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), it was incubated in 0.2 m glycine, pH 2, for 5 min. ECL-Plus or ECL-Advance (Amersham Biosciences) was used for visualization. Snf1 Protein Kinase Is Activated in Response to Some Environmental Stresses—We first examined Snf1 protein kinase activity in cells exposed to salt stress. For this and other experiments, wild-type cells of the W303 genetic background were grown to exponential phase in rich medium containing 2% glucose (YPD). Cells were collected by rapid filtration, resuspended in YPD medium containing 1 m NaCl and harvested at time points from 5 to 60 min. Extracts were prepared, Snf1 was partially purified, and Snf1 catalytic activity was assayed by phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide substrate. Snf1 activity increased about 3-fold within 5 min, and the activation persisted for more than 1 h (Fig. 1A). In cultures grown to mid-log phase in YPD containing 1 m NaCl, Snf1 catalytic activity was elevated (0.87 ± 0.14 nmol/min/mg). To determine the effects of NaCl concentration, cells were shifted to medium containing 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 m NaCl for 5 min, and Snf1 activity was assayed; activation was maximal in 1 m NaCl (Fig. 1B). To determine whether ionic or hyperosmotic stress was responsible, we exposed cells to sorbitol at concentrations up to 1.5 m; Snf1 activity did not increase substantially (Fig. 1C). We then tested other stress conditions, including alkaline pH, heat shock, and oxidative stress. Yeast cells prefer an acidic environment, and a shift to alkaline pH causes stress. To assay the effects of alkaline pH on Snf1 activity, cells were grown to exponential phase in YPD (pH of the culture ∼6.2), collected by filtration, and resuspended in YPD medium buffered to pH 6–8. Exposure to alkaline pH elevated Snf1 activity within 5 min (Fig. 1D), with a 5-fold increase in Snf1 activity at pH 8. However, after 1 h at pH 8, Snf1 activity was reduced to near basal levels (0.66 ± 0.11 nmol/min/mg); we confirmed that the pH of the medium remained alkaline. To test the effects of heat shock, we resuspended the cells in prewarmed YPD at 42 and 50 °C and incubated them for 5 min; no activation of Snf1 was detected in response to heat shock (Fig. 1E). In similar experiments, no increase in Snf1 activity was observed when cells were incubated at 40 or 45 °C for 20 and 40 min (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis showed that levels of Snf1 protein did not decrease (data not shown). To examine the response to oxidative stress, we added H2O2 to the culture at concentrations up to 1 mm for 5 min. Treatment with 0.3 mm H2O2 caused a modest (2-fold) increase in Snf1 activity (Fig. 1F), which was evident by 1 min (data not shown); results were similar for 0.3–1 mm H2O2 after 10 min (data not shown). We next examined the effect of sudden inhibition of respiratory metabolism. Cells were grown in YEP containing 2% glycerol, a nonfermentable carbon source; utilization of glycerol requires Snf1 function, and the kinase was active in these cells (Fig. 1G). Respiration was then blocked by the addition of antimycin A, an inhibitor of the cytochrome bc1 complex (41Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 301: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 42Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8708-8714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Snf1 activity increased within 5 min (Fig. 1G). The addition of antimycin A to cells growing by fermentation of glucose had little effect on Snf1 activity (data not shown). In mammalian cells, antimycin A causes depletion of ATP and activates AMPK (2Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar). Finally, we tested whether metformin or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICA) riboside, which activate AMPK in mammalian cells, would similarly activate Snf1 protein kinase in yeast cells. The biguanide metformin is widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and causes activation of AMPK (43Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4429) Google Scholar), apparently as an indirect effect of inhibition of complex 1 of the respiratory chain (44Owen M.R. Doran E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, AICA-riboside is phosphorylated to yield an AMP mimetic, which activates AMPK (45Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). The addition of metformin (up to 10 mm) to yeast cells grown in YPD or in YEP containing 2% glycerol did not affect Snf1 activity after 5 or 30 min (data not shown). In a similar experiment, the addition of AICA-riboside (2 mm) to yeast cells had no effect. Phosphorylation of Thr-210 of Snf1 in Response to Stress—Snf1 is phosphorylated on Thr-210 in the activation loop in response to glucose limitation (9McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To examine the phosphorylation of Thr-210 in cells exposed to NaCl, alkaline pH, or oxidative stress, we carried out immunoblot analysis of the protein samples assayed above using antibody against phospho-Thr-172 of AMPK, which also specifically recognizes phospho-Thr-210 of Snf1 (15Orlova M. Kanter E. Krakovich D. Kuchin S. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Sutherland C.M. Hawley S.A. McCartney R.R. Leech A. Stark M.J. Schmidt M.C. Hardie D.G.

Chem. 2006; 281: 25336-25343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In each case, Thr-210 was phosphorylated, whereas Snf1 protein levels did not significantly change (Figs. 2 and 3D). The extent of phosphorylation in cells exposed to different salt concentrations or pH roughly paralleled the activation of Snf1 catalytic activity (compare with Fig. 1). These results are in agreement with a previous report that Thr-210 is phosphorylated in cells exposed to 0.8 m NaCl for 1 h (9McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We did not detect increased phosphorylation after heat shock (5 min at 42 or 50 °C and 20 or 40 min at 45 °C; data not shown).FIGURE 3Activation of Snf1 protein kinase in cells lacking upstream kinases. A–C, cultures of wild type (WT), single mutant, double mutant, and sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ (triple) mutant cells were grown to mid-log phase in YPD. An aliquot (100 ml) of the culture was harvested by rapid filtration with no treatment (none). Additional aliquots of each culture were collected by filtration, resuspended, exposed to stress, and collected by filtration. Snf1 activity was measured by phosphorylation of SAMS peptide. A, cells were resuspended in YPD medium containing 1 m NaCl and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. B, cells were resuspended in YPD medium adjusted to pH 8.0 or containing 1 m NaCl for 5 min. For oxidative stress, H2O2 was added to a 100-ml culture aliquot to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. Results are from at least two independent experiments, each with 3–4 assays. C, cells were exposed to 1 m NaCl, pH 8, or 0.3 mm H2O2 for 5 min, as described for B. Proteins (2 μg) were used for immunoblot analysis. The sak1Δ samples were from fractions assayed in B, and wild-type samples were the same as those shown in Fig. 2. Membranes were first blotted with anti-phospho-Thr-172-AMPK antibody to visualize phosphorylation on Thr-210 of Snf1 (pT210) and then were reprobed with anti-Snf1 antibody. D, cultures of wild-type and single mutant cells were grown to mid-log phase in YPD containing 1 m NaCl. Cultures were collected by filtration, and Snf1 activity was assayed as described in A–C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Protein Kinases Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1 Activate Snf1 in Response to Environmental Stress—Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1 are responsible for activation of Snf1 when cells are subjected to centrifugation or carbon stress (33Hong S.-P.

Stark M.J. Schmidt M.C. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1299-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To determine whether these kinases also activate Snf1 in response to other stresses, we exposed sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ triple mutant cells to 1 m NaCl, pH 8, or 0.3 mm H2O2 for 5 min as described above. Snf1 protein kinase was not activated, as determined by assaying phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide (<0.1 nmol/mg/min; Fig. 3A and data not shown), and no phosphorylation of Thr-210 was detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3C). These findings indicate that activation of Snf1 protein kinase in response to all of these different stress conditions requires Sak1, Tos3, or Elm1. We next addressed the possibility that the three upstream kinases exhibit specificity for activation of Snf1 in response to different stresses. To examine the requirement for individual upstream kinases in the response to salt stress, we treated the sak1Δ, tos3Δ, and elm1Δ single mutants with 1 m NaCl for 5 min and assayed Snf1 protein kinase activity. The sak1Δ mutant showed a marked decrease in Snf1 activity relative to wild type, whereas the elm1Δ mutant showed a modest decrease and the tos3Δ mutant was indistinguishable from wild type (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed previously for the response of these mutants to abrupt glucose depletion (36Hedbacker K. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The sak1Δ mutant still showed a 3-fold increase in Snf1 activity in response to salt stress, because the basal Snf1 activity was also lower in the mutant than in the wild type. Mutation of SAK1 also impaired activation of Snf1 in response to alkaline pH and oxidative stress (Fig. 3B; compare Fig. 1). Immunoblot analysis showed that phosphorylation of Thr-210 was reduced in the sak1Δ mutant relative to wild type (Fig. 3C). These findings indicate that Sak1 is the major, although not the sole, upstream kinase that activates Snf1 in response to these different stresses. To determine whether each of the upstream kinases alone suffices for activation of Snf1 by salt stress, we examined double mutants expressing only Tos3 (sak1Δ elm1Δ), Elm1 (sak1Δ tos3Δ), or Sak1 (tos3Δ elm1Δ). Although basal Snf1 catalytic activity was low in cells expressing only Tos3 or Elm1, activity increased upon exposure to 1 m NaCl for 5 min (Fig. 3A). Sak1 was sufficient for nearly normal activity in glucose-grown tos3Δ elm1Δ cells and for activation to wild-type levels upon salt stress. Thus, activation of Snf1 in response to salt stress signals can be mediated by any one of these upstream kinases, with Sak1 being the most effective. We further assessed the possibility that the different upstream kinases have different relative importance after adaptation to high salt concentration than during acute stress. Cultures of single mutant cells were grown to mid-log phase in YPD containing 1 m NaCl, and Snf1 catalytic activity was assayed; Sak1 remained the primary upstream kinase under these conditions (Fig. 3D). Finally, we considered the possibility that the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (47Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) has a role in regulating the activation of Snf1 in response to salt stress. Wild-type and hog1Δ mutant cells were grown in YPD and assayed after no treatment or after exposure to 1 m NaCl for 5 min. The mutation had no detectable effect on Snf1 activity (data not shown). Snf1 Is Regulated by Sodium Ion and Alkaline Stress When Activated by a Heterologous Upstream Kinase—These findings that each of the three upstream kinases activates Snf1 in response to salt stress suggest that each kinase mediates salt stress signaling or that signaling is independent of the upstream kinase. To distinguish between these possibilities, we took advantage of the ability of a heterologous kinase, mammalian Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase α (CaMKKα), to function as a Snf1-activating kinase. Expression of CaMKKα suffices for activation of Snf1 protein kinase in glucose-deprived sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ yeast cells (48Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Carlson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21804-21809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To assess the requirement for native yeast upstream kinases to mediate salt and alkaline pH stress signals, we examined sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ cells expressing CaMKKα from a plasmid.

https://openalex.org/W2005799364,"Regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1) is the only known guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for the Ran GTPase and has pivotal roles in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, mitosis, and nuclear-envelope assembly. RCC1 associates dynamically with chromatin through binding to histones H2A and/or H2B in a Ran-regulated manner. Here, we report that, unexpectedly, the amino-terminal serine or proline residue of RCC1 is uniquely methylated on its alpha-amino group. Methylation requires removal of the initiating methionine, and the presence of proline and lysine at positions 3 and 4, respectively. Methylation-defective mutants of RCC1 bind less effectively than wild-type protein to chromatin during mitosis, which causes spindle-pole defects. We propose a bimodal attachment mechanism for RCC1 in which the tail promotes stable RCC1 association with chromatin through DNA binding in an alpha-N-methylation-dependent manner. These data provide the first known function for N-terminal protein methylation."

Arginine methylation is a common posttranslational modification that occurs in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (1Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The methylation of arginine residues is catalyzed by at least two different classes of protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 2The abbreviations used are: PRMT, protein arginine N-methyltransferase; rpS2, ribosomal protein S2; GAR motif, glycine/arginine-rich motif; FLAG, peptide epitope DYKDDDDK; ES, embryonic stem cell; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast. 2The abbreviations used are: PRMT, protein arginine N-methyltransferase; rpS2, ribosomal protein S2; GAR motif, glycine/arginine-rich motif; FLAG, peptide epitope DYKDDDDK; ES, embryonic stem cell; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast. enzymes. The Type I enzymes catalyze the formation of asymmetric NG,NG-dimethylarginine residues and the Type II enzyme catalyzes the formation of symmetric NG,N′G-dimethylarginine residues. In mammals, there are five Type I enzymes (PRMT1, 3, 4, 6 and 8). Proteins that are substrates for the PRMTs usually contain glycine and arginine-rich patches, GAR motifs, that are the sites of methylation. The major pools of protein that are arginine methylated are the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, histones, and ribosomal proteins. Thirty years ago, HeLa cell ribosomal proteins were shown to be heavily lysine- and arginine-methylated (2Chang F.N. Navickas I.J. Chang C.N. Dancis B.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and further two-dimensional gel electrophoresis studies of purified ribosomes demonstrated that at least six prominent proteins are arginine methylated (3Chang F.N. Navickas I.J. Au C. Budzilowicz C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 518: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PRMT3 is a ribosome-associated protein (4Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and may be responsible for much of the arginine methylation that occurs in this molecular machine. PRMT3 was identified as a PRMT1 binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen (6Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, gel filtration analysis of RAT1 cells demonstrated that PRMT3 occurs as a monomer and is not complexed in vivo with PRMT1 (6Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). PRMT3 also interacts with the tumor suppressor DAL-1 (7Singh V. Miranda T.B. Jiang W. Frankel A. Roemer M.E. Robb V.A. Gutmann D.H. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. Newsham I.F. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7761-7771Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This interaction inhibits PRMT3 enzymatic activity, both in in vitro reactions and in cell lines. At the organ level, PRMT3 is ubiquitously expressed (6Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), but in the brain it displays higher expression in neurons than in glial cells (8Ikenaka K. Miyata S. Mori Y. Koyama Y. Taneda T. Okuda H. Kousaka A. Tohyama M. Neuroscience. 2006; 141: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PRMT3 is the only type 1 arginine methyltransferase that is localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (6Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 9Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Another unique property of PRMT3 is that it harbors a zinc finger domain at its N terminus. It has been proposed that this domain may play a role in the regulation of PRMT3 activity or in the recognition of PRMT3 substrates (6Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 10Frankel A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32974-32982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis studies demonstrated that PRMT3 lacking the zinc finger domain is still active in vitro, however the zinc finger minus enzyme loses its ability to methylate substrates when presented with a complex mix of hypomethylated proteins isolated from RAT1 cells (10Frankel A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32974-32982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This suggests that the zinc finger is the substrate recognition module of PRMT3. Indeed, it was recently found that the 40 S ribosomal protein S2 (rpS2) is a zinc finger-dependent substrate of PRMT3 (5Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Importantly, in fission yeast this same enzyme/substrate pair (PRMT3/rpS2) exists (4Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the disruption of the rmt3 gene in this organism results in an imbalance in the 40 S:60 S free subunit ratio. Furthermore, rmt3-null cells compensate for the loss of RMT3 by increasing the production of 40 S ribosomal proteins (11Bachand F. Lackner D.H. Bahler J. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings demonstrate a highly conserved role for arginine methylation in ribosomal assembly and protein biosynthesis. To establish the biological role of PRMT3 in mice, we generated a knock-out model system. We investigated the effects of PRMT3 loss on mouse embryo development. In addition, we used cell lines derived from these mice to investigate the methylation status of ribosome-associated proteins. Generation of PRMT3-targeted Mice—The ES cell line (XC265, strain 129/Ola) was kindly provided by BayGenomics. These ES cells were transferred to the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center's genetically engineered mouse facility for blastocyst injection and chimeric mice production. Southern analysis with an “external” probe confirmed three XC265 chimeras successfully transmitted the targeted allele through the germline. The Prmt3+/– mice are fertile and healthy, with no obvious abnormalities. These lines are being maintained on a mixed 129/B6 background and an inbred 129 background. The external probe for Prmt3 knock-out genotyping is 540 bp long and includes exon 14 and surrounding 5′ and 3′ intron sequences. It was generated by PCR, from 129 mouse genomic DNA and subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen).

Antibodies and Plasmids—All GST fusion proteins were subcloned in pGEX6P1 (Amersham Biosciences). pGEX6P1-PRMT3 and pGEX6P1-rpS2 were generated by PCR using FirstChoice™ PCR-ready mouse kidney cDNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) as described previously (5Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).

The FLAG-tagged PRMT3 was subcloned into a pTRACER vector (Invitrogen) as described previously (5Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The αPRMT3 antibody was raised in rabbits against GST-PRMT3(zf), which encodes amino acids 1 to 183 of mouse PRMT3. The αrpS2 antibody was raised in rabbits against GST-rpS2, which encodes amino acids 1–293 of mouse rpS2. The αasym24 and αPRMT1 antibodies were a gift from Dr. Stephane Richard (University of McGill, Montréal, Canada). αrpS6 antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-βGal was obtained from Cortex Biochem (San Leandro, CA). In Vitro Methylation Assays Using GST-PRMT3—The GST, GST-GAR, GST-rpS2, GST-PRMT3, and GST-PRMT3Δ34 were expressed and purified as described previously (5Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In vitro methylation reactions were performed in a final volume of 30 μl of PBS (pH = 7.4). The reaction contained 0.5–1.0 μg of substrate and 1 μg of recombinant GST-PRMT3 of GST-PRMT3Δ34. All methylation reactions were carried out in the presence of 0.42 μm [3H]AdoMet (S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine) (79 Ci/mmol from a 7.5 μm stock solution; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, then subjected to fluorography by separation on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, treated with EN3HANCE™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film overnight. In Vitro Methylation of Cell Extracts Using GST-PRMT3—Individual embryos from Prmt3+/– intercrosses at E13.5 were placed into culture as described (12Yadav N. Lee J. Kim J. Shen J. Hu M.C. Aldaz C.M.

Cells were maintained on a 3T3-culture protocol in which 106 cells were passed onto a gelatinized 10-cm dish every 3 days. MEF extracts were prepared using mild lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH = 7.50), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). Cell debris was spun down for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The resulting extract was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against PBS. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Dialyzed MEF extracts were stored at –80 °C until further analysis. For the in vitro methylation assays shown in Fig. 2 the reactions were performed in a final volume of 30 μl of PBS. Briefly, 50 μg of total protein MEF extract was mixed with 1 μg of GST-PRMT3 and 2 μl of [3H]AdoMet (79 Ci/mmol from a 7.5 μm stock solution) and incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. Methylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and visualized by fluorography. For the immunodepletion experiment total cell lysates were incubated with the immobilized antibodies four successive times to remove all traces of rpS2. In Vitro Methylation Assay with Ribosomal Fractions—The in vitro methylation assays shown in Fig. 4 used FLAG-PRMT3, because we wanted to carry out Western analysis of rpS2 after fluorography to confirm equal loading, and the αrpS2 antibody that we have was raised against a GST fusion of rpS2. For this purpose, HeLa cells were transfected with 10 μg of FLAG-PRMT3 using 30 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). At 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and cell extracts were prepared using mild lysis buffer. FLAG-tagged PRMT3 was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG®-M2 beads (Sigma-Aldrich). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, FLAG-tagged PRMT3 bound to anti-FLAG®-M2 beads was washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS to a final volume of 60 μl. Ribosomal fractions corresponding to cytoplasm (fractions 1–5), 40S (fractions 6 and 7), 60 S (fractions 8 and 9), and 80 S (fractions 10 and 11) ribosomal subunits, and polysomes (fractions 12–18) were pulled together. For the in vitro methylation assay, 10 μl of concentrated proteins were mixed with 10 μl FLAG-PRMT3 bound to anti-FLAG®-M2 beads and 2 μl of [3H]AdoMet (79 Ci/mmol from a 7.5 μm stock solution). The final volume of the reaction was adjusted to 30 μl with PBS. After 90 min of incubation at 30 °C, methylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and visualized by fluorography. Polysome Profiling—MEF cells (passage 2) from Prmt3+/+ and Prmt3–/– E13.5 embryos, at 90% confluence, were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum and 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide. After that, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS (containing 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide). Next, cell extract was prepared using 500 μl of polysome lysis buffer (1.0% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 unit/μl RNase inhibitor, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 0.2 mg/ml heparin, protease inhibitors). Following a 10-min incubation on ice, cellular debris was sedimented by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. A total of 20 A260 units of extracts were layered onto 5–45% sucrose gradients prepared in polysome lysis buffer and centrifuged for 3 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. The gradients were then fractionated by upward displacement with Fluorinert FC-40 (Isco Inc., Lincoln, NE), using a gradient fractionator (model 640; Isco Inc.) connected to a UV monitor for continuous measurement of the absorbance at 254 nm. Eighteen 0.6-ml fractions were collected, and proteins were concentrated to a final volume of 100 μl using Ultrafree®-MC centrifugal filter devices (5,000 Da molecular weight cutoff; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The sucrose was replaced by four changes of PBS buffer, 300 μl each. The final volume was adjusted to 100 μl with PBS. Concentrated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. β-Galactosidase Staining and Histological Analysis—E10.5 embryos were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and stained for β-galactosidase expression as described previously (13Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). E12.5 embryos were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Embryos were sectioned at 3 mm and subjected to immunohistochemical localization of β-galactosidase using a specific antibody (Cortex Biochem, San Leandro, CA). Staining was performed using the En-Vision system (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), and the counterstain was hematoxylin. Generating Mice Deficient in PRMT3—The Prmt3 gene has been targeted in mouse embryonic stem cells using gene trapping technology developed by Skarnes et al. (14Skarnes W.C. Moss J.E. Hurtley S.M. Beddington R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6592-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The targeted ES cell clone (XC265) was obtained from the BayGenomics research consortium. The mutant ES cell line contains an insertional mutation in intron 14 of Prmt3 (Fig. 1A). This insertion is predicted to leave PRMT3 largely intact and only removed the last 34 amino acids of this enzyme, unless the insertion destabilizes the transcript. Structural data reveals that the C-terminal portion of PRMT3 is an elongated nine-stranded β-barrel (15Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and the truncation in the XC265 cells will eliminate the last three of these β-strands (Fig. 1C). The removal of the last β-strand (number 15) of yeast Hmt1 is sufficient to prevent substrate binding and almost completely disrupt enzymatic activity (16Weiss V.H. McBride A.E. Soriano M.A. Filman D.J. Silver P.A. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the truncation generated by the trapping mutant in the XC265 ES cell line will fully incapacitate PRMT3. To test this, we generated a truncated GST-PRMT3Δ34 and compared it to wild-type PRMT3 in an in vitro methylation assay on two known substrates, rpS2 and GAR (Fig. 1B). GST-PRMT3Δ34 displayed no enzymatic activity. Thus, even if the truncated transcript is stable in the XC265 ES cells, it will likely be non-functional. To characterize the biological function of PRMT3, we proceeded to generate chimeric mice using XC265 ES cells that were then bred to establish heterozygous (Prmt3+/–) progeny. A probe for Southern analysis was developed for genotyping these mice. The gene-trapping vector introduces a new BamHI site, which results in a 6-kb down-shift of the Southern band for mice carrying the mutant allele (Fig. 1D). The Effects of PRMT3 Loss on rpS2 Methylation—Prmt3+/– mice were normal and fertile and were intercrossed, producing Prmt3–/– mice and embryos. To facilitate additional studies of PRMT3 cellular functions, we cultured MEFs from E13.5 embryos. Four Prmt3+/+ MEF lines (1, 5, 9, and 12) and four Prmt3–/– MEF lines (3, 6, 10, and 13) were established. The integrity of PRMT3 expression in the established MEF lines was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). A longer exposure of this Western reveals that there is a faint band at the position of the endogenous PRMT3 protein. It also exposes the existence of a large molecular weight band that is unique to the Prmt3–/– MEF line and may represent the PRMT3-βgeo fusion protein. To confirm that this unique band is indeed the PRMT3-βgeo fusion protein, we immunoprecipitated PRMT3 from a Prmt3+/+ MEF line (12Yadav N. Lee J. Kim J. Shen J. Hu M.C. Aldaz C.M. Bedford M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6464-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and a Prmt3–/– MEF line (3Chang F.N. Navickas I.J. Au C. Budzilowicz C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 518: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and performed Western blot analysis with an anti-βGal antibody. The same blot was stripped and re-probed with an αPRMT3 antibody. Both antibodies recognize the same band at roughly 170 kDa (Fig. 2B). Again in this experiment we see a faint band at the position of the endogenous PRMT3 protein, and densitometric quantitation was performed on the endogenous band from the wild-type and knock-out cell lines. We conclude that the insertional mutation results in a hypomorphic Prmt3 allele, with 5–7% wild-type PRMT3 expression levels in Prmt3–/– cells. This is reminiscent of Prmt1–/– cells that were generated in a similar fashion through insertional mutagenesis (17Pawlak M.R. Scherer C.A. Chen J. Roshon M.J. Ruley H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the ribosomal protein rpS2 interacts with the zinc finger of PRMT3 and that this ribosomal protein is an in vitro substrate for this enzyme (5Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To determine whether rpS2 is an in vivo substrate for PRMT3, we methylated total cell lysates from wild-type (5 and 12) and knock-out (3 and 10) cells with GST-PRMT3 and tritium labeled AdoMet. We see that a protein the size of rpS2 (30 kDa) is strongly methylated in knock-out cells but not in wild-type cell extracts (Fig. 2C, lanes 13–16). This indicates that rpS2 is hypomethylated in Prmt3 knock-out cells, thus making it a good in vitro substrate. However, in Prmt3 wild-type cells rpS2 is likely heavily methylated, with most methylation sites already fully occupied, thus making it a poor substrate for recombinant PRMT3. The same amount of rpS2 is present in both wild-type and knock-out cells. To unequivocally confirm that this 30-kDa labeled band is indeed rpS2, we immunodepleted rpS2 from total cell lysates and detected no methylated band following GST-PRMT3 methylation of these preparations (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–8). The 30-kDa labeled band is still present after immunodepletion with pre-immune sera (Fig. 2C, lanes 9–12). Furthermore, immunoprecipitated rpS2 from knock-out cells is a good substrate for GST-PRMT3 (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4), and migrates at the same position as the methylated band in the total cell lysate. Taken together, these data support the finding that rpS2 is the major PRMT3 substrate. We can also show that rpS2 is hypomethylated in Prmt3 knock-out cells in a more direct fashion. The rpS2 protein contains two potential arginine methylation motifs at its N-terminal end, two copies of an RGGF motif and eight direct RG repeats. Deletion analysis has shown that the primary site of rpS2 methylation by PRMT3, in vitro, is the RG repeat region (5Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A methyl-specific antibody (ASYM24) has been raised to methylate RG repeats (18Boisvert F.M. Cote J. Boulanger M.C. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1319-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Using this ASYM24 antibody, we have shown that rpS2 is hypomethylated in PRMT3 knock-out cells (Fig. 2D). A small amount of immunoreactivity is seen with rpS2 from knock-out cells, which can be eliminated with adenosine dialdehyde treatment. The residual amounts of PRMT3 in these cells (Fig. 2, A and B) may account for this methylation. Prmt3-deficient Embryos Are Small—At weaning, Prmt3–/– mice occur at roughly the expected mendelian ratios indicating that the reduced levels of PRMT3 found in these mice are not embryonically lethal (Table 1). However, when we generated the MEF lines from E13.5 embryos we noticed that the mutant embryos were consistently smaller than their wild-type littermates (Fig. 3A). It should be noted here that the pigmentless eye of the Prmt3–/– is not part of the PRMT3 null phenotype. Rather, it is due to the fact the 129/Ola ES cells, which were used by BayGenomics to generate their gene-trap library, carry a mutation in the pink-eyed dilution (p) gene on mouse chromosome 7, and Prmt3 maps very closely to this gene. Thus, these two mutations usually segregate together.TABLE 1Genotypes of offspring from PRMT3+/– intercrossesAgeTotal offspringGenotype+/++/--/-E13.5181637939E18.5189459945Weaning586161305120 Open table in a new tab To further investigate this developmental phenotype, we established time pregnancies and investigated embryonic weights at E13.5 and E18.5. We found that mutant embryos at E13.5 are on average 75% the size of their wild-type littermates (Fig. 3B). By E18.5, this size difference is not as striking, with mutants on average 82% the size of their wild-type littermates (Fig. 3C), and by weaning age (P21) there is no size difference between mutants and wild-types. Like PRMT1, PRMT3 is ubiquitously expressed in adults (6Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The mutant PRMT3 allele is expressed as a PRMT3-βgeo fusion, which facilitates X-gal staining of Prmt3–/– embryos to reflect the endogenous PRMT3 expression pattern. X-gal staining of Prmt3–/– E10.5 embryos reveals expression at the base of the neural tube, in elements of the hepatic/biliary primordial and in the olfactory placode (Fig. 3D). By E12.5 PRMT3 expression becomes broader, as detected by anti-β-galactosidase antibody staining (Fig. 3E). The 40 S:60 S Ribosomal Subunit Ratio Remains Unperturbed in Prmt3-deficient Mouse Cells—In fission yeast, the loss of RMT3 (the PRMT3 orthologue) results in a striking ribosomal subunit imbalance, with the reduction of 40 S and accumulation of 60 S ribosomal subunits (11Bachand F. Lackner D.H. Bahler J. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine whether the same phenomenon occurs in mammalian cells, we purified polysomes from primary wild-type and Prmt3–/– MEFs by sucrose gradient fractionation. The polysome profile of these two cell types was undistinguishable (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, Western blot analysis shows that both rpS2 and rpS6 remain associated with the ribosomal fractions. Thus, the arginine methylation of rpS2 by PRMT3 is likely not required for either its incorporation into ribosomes or for the maintenance of ribosomal structural integrity. However, it should be noted that rpS2 methylation is decreased by 80% and is not fully absent in the Prmt3–/– MEFs (Fig. 2D), thus the integrity of the ribosome may be maintained by this residual methylation. We also investigated the efficiency of overall protein synthesis in primary MEFs by 35S incorporation into nascent proteins and found that the protein synthesis rate was unperturbed by the loss of PRMT3 in MEFs (data not shown). Ribosomal-associated Proteins Other than rpS2 Are PRMT3-specific Substrates—To investigate whether any ribosomal proteins other than rpS2 are methylated by PRMT3, we pooled the sucrose gradient fractionation and methylated them with FLAG-PRMT3 in vitro. No methylated substrates are detected in the ribosomal fractions from wild-type cells, indicating that the methylatable sites are fully occupied in the PRMT3 substrates. These substrates are hypomethylated in the Prmt3–/– fractions and are thus good targets for the in vitro methylation reaction (Fig. 4C). Again, we clearly detect rpS2 as the predominant PRMT3 substrate. However, we also see a protein of 40 kDa that is methylated in knock-out fractions but not in the wild-type fractions. Like rpS2, this protein is most abundant in the 40 S fraction. Data base searches of ribosomal proteins of this size that also harbor a GAR-motif were performed, but no candidate substrate was identified. Clearly, the use of hypomethylated Prmt3–/– cellular extracts will aid in the identification of new PRMT3 substrates in the future. Mammalian PRMT3 and its primary substrate, rpS2, are both ribosome-associated proteins (5Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The disruption of the Prmt3 gene results in reduced embryo body size during organogenesis and the fetal growth period. E13.5 embryos are undergoing rapid growth, and if gross protein synthesis or even the translation of a few select transcripts are attenuated due to the loss of rpS2 (and other protein) methylation, this may manifest as a reduction in size. This size phenotype is not as striking at E18.5 but is still significant, and by birth we cannot identify mutants based solely on their size. This phenotype is reminiscent of mutations in Drosophila ribosomal protein genes, collectively known as Minutes (19Lambertsson A. Adv. Genet. 1998; 38: 69-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Indeed, a P element insertion into the Drosophila rpS2 gene, referred to as string of pearls, has Minute-like characteristics (20Cramton S.E. Laski F.A. Genetics. 1994; 137: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the 40 S:60 S ribosomal subunit ratio remains unperturbed in Prmt3-deficient mouse cells, it is possible that significant changes in the translational activities of selected mRNAs may occur in these cells to compensate for the loss of PRMT3, as is the case in the rmt3-null cells (11Bachand F. Lackner D.H. Bahler J. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Of particular interest would be the 40 S ribosomal protein-encoding mRNAs that are redistributed to active larger polysomes in fission yeast mutant cells. It has long been known that ribosomal proteins are heavily methylated on both arginine and lysine residues (2Chang F.N. Navickas I.J. Chang C.N. Dancis B.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Subsequently, amino acid analysis of two-dimensional separated ribosomal proteins identified six different protein spots that were arginine-methylated and one lysine-methylated protein spot (3Chang F.N. Navickas I.J. Au C. Budzilowicz C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 518: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More recently, using methylarginine-specific antibodies a number of ribosomal proteins were affinity-purified as methylated proteins (18Boisvert F.M. Cote J. Boulanger M.C. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1319-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The physiological role of rpS2 methylation has so far remained obscure. To some extent, this enzyme/substrate pair of PRMT3/rpS2 is evocative of the S6 kinase/rpS6 pairing. Both enzyme substrate pairs have been conserved over an extended evolutionary period and are found from yeast to man (4Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Johnson S.P. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Pende M. Um S.H. Mieulet V. Sticker M. Goss V.L. Mestan J. Mueller M. Fumagalli S. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of rpS6 occurs in response to numerous growth stimulatory agents and temporally correlates with the initiation of protein synthesis (23Shamji A.F. Nghiem P. Schreiber S.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). There is as yet no evidence that the methylation of rpS2 can be regulated by dynamic signal transduction events. Indeed, all experiments point to the fact that rpS2 is constitutively methylated in cells. The region of rpS2 that is methylated by PRMT3 has been mapped to a repeat of eight RG residues at its N-terminal end (5Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This is a classic GAR motif. In vitro this motif can be methylated by PRMT1, PRMT3, PRMT5, PRMT6, and PRMT8 (24Bedford M.T. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. The Family of Protein Arginine Methyltransferases. Academic Press, New York2006: 31-50Google Scholar, 25Lee J. Sayegh J. Daniel J. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32890-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, in cells derived from Prmt3 knock-out embryos, rpS2 is hypomethylated, which indicates that in vivo no other PRMT can cover for the loss of PRMT3. This is likely due to the fact that the zinc finger of PRMT3 interacts strongly with rpS2. Indeed, rpS2 was identified as a PRMT3 substrate by using the rpS2 zinc finger as an affinity reagent (5Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, in certain cases it may be important for PRMTs and their substrates to be tightly associated. Of the nine identified PRMTs, four have been genetically targeted in the mouse. Prmt1 nulls are early embryonic lethal and die shortly after implantation (17Pawlak M.R. Scherer C.A. Chen J. Roshon M.J. Ruley H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Carm1 knock-out embryos survive to birth and die perinataly (12Yadav N. Lee J. Kim J. Shen J. Hu M.C. Aldaz C.M. Bedford M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6464-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In addition to their small size, Carm1 null embryos have a T cell developmental defect (26Kim J. Lee J. Yadav N. Wu Q. Carter C. Richard S. Richie E. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25339-25344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Prmt2 has recently been knocked out in mice and display no gross abnormalities (27Yoshimoto T. Boehm M. Olive M. Crook M.F. San H. Langenickel T. Nabel E.G. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2040-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Prmt3 is now the latest member of the arginine methyltransferase family to be knocked out in mice, with null embryos displaying a clear size difference during gestation and null cells providing genetic evidence that the ribosomal protein rpS2 is a dedicated PRMT3 substrate. We thank members of the Bedford laboratory for helpful discussion throughout this project. Also, we thank Nancy Abbey for immunohistochemistry (NIEHS/National Institutes of Health Grant ES07784) and Jan Parker-Thornburg for blastocyst injections (NCI/National Institutes of Health Grant CA016672/GEMF)."
https://openalex.org/W2060941242,"Intricate interactions between kinetochores and microtubules are essential for the proper distribution of chromosomes during mitosis. A crucial long-standing question is how vertebrate kinetochores generate chromosome motion while maintaining attachments to the dynamic plus ends of the multiple kinetochore MTs (kMTs) in a kinetochore fibre. Here, we demonstrate that individual kMTs in PtK1 cells are attached to the kinetochore outer plate by several fibres that either embed the microtubule plus-end tips in a radial mesh, or extend out from the outer plate to bind microtubule walls. The extended fibres also interact with the walls of nearby microtubules that are not part of the kinetochore fibre. These structural data, in combination with other recent reports, support a network model of kMT attachment wherein the fibrous network in the unbound outer plate, including the Hec1–Ndc80 complex, dissociates and rearranges to form kMT attachments."
https://openalex.org/W1995947461,"Abnormal centrosome numbers are detected in virtually all cancers. The molecular mechanisms that underlie centrosome amplification, however, are poorly characterized. Based on the model that each maternal centriole serves as a template for the formation of one and only one daughter centriole per cell division cycle, the prevailing view is that centriole overduplication arises from successive rounds of centriole reproduction. Here, we provide evidence that a single maternal centriole can concurrently generate multiple daughter centrioles. This mechanism was initially identified in cells treated with the peptide vinyl sulfone proteasome inhibitor Z-L(3)VS. We subsequently found that the formation of more than one daughter at maternal centrioles requires cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 as well as Polo-like kinase 4 and that overexpression of these proteins mimics this phenotype in the absence of a proteasome inhibitor. Moreover, we show that the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein stimulates aberrant daughter centriole numbers in part through the formation of more than one daughter centriole at single maternal templates. These results help to explain how oncogenic stimuli can rapidly induce abnormal centriole numbers within a single cell-division cycle and provide insights into the regulation of centriole duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2091240925,"Mechanisms regulating the nuclear localization of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) remained enigmatic despite the crucial regulation by nuclear GSK3β of important cellular functions. These include regulation of gene expression, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, achieved by the phosphorylation by GSK3 of nuclear substrates (e.g. numerous transcription factors). We resolved this mechanism by identifying a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that is necessary for the nuclear accumulation of GSK3β and is sufficient to drive yellow fluorescent protein into the nucleus. Despite the NLS, most GSK3β is cytosolic, sequestered in protein complexes that, although still mobile in the cytosol, block the NLS. Conditions promoting nuclear translocation of GSK3β release it from cytosolic complexes, allowing the NLS to direct nuclear import. Using this information to prepare a nucleus-excluded active GSK3 construct, we found that the antiapoptotic effect of GSK3β in tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis is mediated by cytosolic, not nuclear, GSK3β.

Cells have the inherent ability to rapidly and concurrently modulate the actions of many proteins in response to environmental and biological cues. A large part of these coordinated cellular responses are due to posttranslational modifications of key regulatory proteins. This requires the appropriate localization of the modifying enzymes, particularly protein kinases, since phosphorylation is the predominant mechanism for Protein posttranslational modification.

Nuclear GSK3β levels decrease in response to stimulation by proliferative growth factors, whereas insults that induce apoptosis can cause accumulation of GSK3β in the nucleus prior to the activation of the caspase cascade (2Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additionally, GSK3β in the nucleus is highly active relative to cytosolic GSK3β (3Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 2415-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Fluxes in GSK3β in the nucleus at critical periods may be related to the well documented capacity of nuclear GSK3β to regulate many transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), Snail, p53, AP-1, Myc, and others, that exert widespread effects on cellular functions by regulating the expression of many genes (4Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.-S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 5Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar, 6Zhou B.P. Deng J. Xia W. Xu J. Li Y.M. Gunduz M. Hung M.C. Nat.

Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Thus, cellular phenotype and survival can be influenced by the level of GSK3β in the nucleus. Despite these crucial cellular events involving nuclear GSK3β, a longstanding problem remains unresolved, deciphering the mechanism of its nuclear import. There are two isoforms of GSK3, GSK3β and GSK3α, and these are involved in modulating a large and diverse number of cellular functions, including metabolism, development, cellular architecture, gene expression, and survival (7Jope R.S. Johnson G.V.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 8Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 9Woodgett J.R. Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 2003; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). GSK3β is constitutively active, but several mechanisms contribute to controlling its actions. Inhibitory phosphorylation by Akt and other kinases occurs on serine 9 of GSK3β. Conversely, phosphorylation of GSK3β on tyrosine 216 increases its activity (8Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 10Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). GSK3β is also regulated by protein complex formation, especially well known in the cytosolic Wnt signaling pathway, where GSK3β associated with a large protein complex phosphorylates β-catenin to promote its degradation (11Ciani L. Salinas P.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of substrates by GSK3β is also usually controlled by the phosphorylation state of the substrate, because most substrates of GSK3β must be “primed,” prephosphorylated at a residue four amino acids C-terminal to the GSK3β target site. A mutation in the primed substrate binding pocket of GSK3β, R96A, that blocks its binding to primed substrates is widely used to identify primed substrates of GSK3β (12Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In addition to these three regulatory mechanisms, the subcellular distribution of GSK3β regulates its actions by controlling its accessibility to substrates, such as those in the nucleus (7Jope R.S. Johnson G.V.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Nuclear levels of proteins are balanced by export and import mechanisms. The nuclear export of GSK3β is inhibited by leptomycin B, indicating that at least a portion of GSK3β nuclear export is CRM1-dependent (2Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Nuclear export of GSK3β is partially mediated by FRAT-1, which binds GSK3β in the nucleus followed by export of the complex via the nuclear export sequence (NES) in FRAT-1 (13Franca-Koh J. Yeo M. Fraser E. Young N. Dale T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43844-43848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To counter export, we hypothesized that GSK3β may contain an NLS; however, examination of the primary amino acid sequence did not reveal a consensus NLS, nor was one identified using the CUBIC NLS prediction algorithm (14Nair R. Carter P. Rost B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined regions in GSK3β rich in basic amino acids (lysine and arginine), a general requirement for an NLS. This enabled us to identify an NLS motif in GSK3β that is necessary for nuclear import of GSK3β and is sufficient to drive the nuclear import of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Further experiments revealed that the subcellular distribution of GSK3β is regulated by the NLS, by the N-terminal tail of GSK3β, and by cytosolic protein complexes that are capable of blocking the NLS function by sequestering GSK3β in the cytosol. Finally, the controversial intracellular site of action of GSK3β that inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cytotoxicity was resolved by showing that this was mediated by NLS-deficient GSK3β in the cytosol. Cell Culture—HEK293, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 15 mm HEPES (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) in humidified, 37 °C chambers with 5% CO2. Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS) and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and proteins were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with antibodies to phospho-Ser9-GSK3β (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), total GSK3β, total poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (BD PharMingen/Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), total GSK3α/β (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or HA tag (Covance, Berkeley, CA). Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG, followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence, and the protein bands were quantitated with a densitometer. Subcellular Fractionation—Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared as previously described (2Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then harvested in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). Cells were centrifuged at 2700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain the cytosolic fraction. The pellet containing nuclei was washed twice in 200 μl of wash buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1% BSA, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The pellet was then resuspended in wash buffer and layered on top of 1 ml of 1 m sucrose (with protease and phosphatase inhibitors), and centrifuged at 2700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was washed in lysis buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The nuclear proteins were extracted by resuspending the pellet in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) and incubating on ice for 30 min. After extraction, the nuclear samples were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was retained as the nuclear extract. Cloning, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Transfection—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on GSK3β-HA in pcDNA3.1+ (generously provided by Dr. J. M. Woodgett, University of Toronto) using the GeneEditor site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. Primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: for lysines 85 and 86 to alanine, GAGAACTGGTCGCCATCGCGGCAGTATTGCAGGACAAGAG; for arginine 102 to glycine and lysine 103 to alanine, GAGCTCCAGATCATGGGAGCGCTAGATCACTGTAAC; for lysines 122 and 123 to alanine, CTACTCCAGTGGTGAGGCGGCAGATGAGGTCTATC. The arginine 96 to alanine and serine 9 to alanine mutants were a kind gift from Dr. G. V. W. Johnson (University of Alabama at Birmingham). To generate Δ9-GSK3β-HA (deletion of the nine N-terminal amino acids), wild-type GSK3β-HA was used as a PCR template with the following primers: 5′-TCTAGCTAGCATGTTTGCGGAGAGCTGCAAGC and 5′-TAAACTATGCGGCCGCTCCGTCGGGACTGTACTAG. The truncated product was inserted into pcDNA3.1+ using NotI and NheI restriction enzymes. DNA encoding the GSK3β NLS was synthesized to contain a 5′ EcoRV compatible end and a 3′ overhang compatible with XbaI, a TAG stop codon, and a 5′ phosphorylation, in addition to the coding region for the NLS (sequence available upon request). The eYFP vector was digested with EcoRV and XbaI, and the NLS was ligated in to generate the YFP-NLS fusion. All DNA was synthesized and PAGE-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The coding regions of all constructs were verified by sequencing at the University of Alabama at Birmingham center for AIDS research DNA sequencing core facility. Cells were transfected 24 h after plating using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) at a ratio of 4 μl of Fugene to 1 μg of DNA following the manufacturer's protocol. To achieve equal expression levels, all constructs were used at equal amounts except K85A,K86A-GSK3β-HA, which required twice as much DNA to reach an equal expression level. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were performed using sheep anti-mouse IgG Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway). The Dynabeads, 10 μl of slurry per sample, were washed twice in PBS plus 0.1% BSA; all washes were performed using a magnetic particle separator. The beads were incubated with 1 μg of anti-GSK3β antibody or 1 μl of anti-HA antibody in PBS/BSA at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing overnight. The beads were then washed twice in PBS/BSA followed by the addition of cell lysate (200 μg of protein). The beads plus lysate were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with end-over-end mixing. The beads were then washed three times with PBS/BSA. GSK3β Activity Measurement—GSK3β was immunoprecipitated, and the beads were washed a final time in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The beads were then resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 250 μm ATP, 1.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 μm phosphoglycogen synthase peptide (Upstate Biotechnology). The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction tubes were centrifuged for 1 min, and triplicate 9-μl aliquots of each sample were spotted on P81 filter paper circles. The filter paper was allowed to dry and then washed three times in 0.5% phosphoric acid for a total time of 1 h, followed by a 10-min wash in 95% ethanol. The filter paper was then air-dried and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Activity was normalized to the amount of GSK3β immunoprecipitated, which was determined by immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in 35-mm dishes. After transfection (24 h), cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then blocked in 3% BSA, PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were stained with Alexa-488-HA antibody (1:2500 in 3% BSA/PBS; Covance) and incubated with rocking at 4 °C overnight. The coverslips were washed with PBS and then incubated with 100 ng/ml Hoechst 33342 for 15 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed for several hours in PBS, with frequent changes of the PBS. The coverslips were mounted on slides and examined by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon) with a ×40 oil immersion objective. Images were captured using Image Pro-plus software. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) and Confocal Microscopy—FRAP analysis was performed in live cells expressing GSK3β-eYFP using the FRAP module on a Leica SP2 laser-scanning confocal microscope with a Leica DMRXE upright microscope using a ×100 oil immersion objective. Prebleach and postbleach images were captured using a 514-nm laser at 20% power with image acquisition at 800 MHz. For bleaching, an area of 13 μm2 was illuminated with the 514-nm laser at 100% power for 6 frames (∼0.7 s/frame). The mobile fraction Mf was calculated using the equation Mf = (F∞ – F0)/(Fi – F0) (15Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 16Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), where F∞ is the fluorescence intensity in the bleached region after recovery, F0 is the fluorescence in the bleached region immediately after the bleach, and Ff is the intensity before the bleach. All values were corrected for loss of fluorescence during acquisition using a region outside of the bleached region. Standard confocal microscopy was performed on live cells using a Leica SP1 laser-scanning confocal with an inverted microscope and ×100 oil immersion objective. All confocal analyses were performed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham high resolution imaging core facility. Flow Cytometry—Annexin-V-PE staining was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD PharMingen). Stained cells were analyzed using a BD LSRII flow cytometer and BD FACSdiva software. Flow cytometry was performed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham center for AIDS research flow cytometry core facility. Cell Death Assay—Cell death in MEFs was measured as described previously with minor modifications (4Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.-S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Cells in 60-mm dishes were co-transfected with the indicated construct and LacZ at a ratio of 2:1. After transfection (24 h), cells were trypsinized and counted, and 20,000 cells/well were plated in a 48-well plate. Cells were grown an additional 24 h, followed by treatment with TNF. Following treatment, β-galactosidase activity was measured and compared with the untreated control for each construct as a measure of cell viability. In Situ Cross-linking—Following the indicated treatments, cells were washed twice in 37°C PBS, followed by the addition of the cross-linker, 2 mm ethylene glycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) (Pierce) in PBS, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was then quenched by the addition of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed in PBS and harvested, and subcellular fractions were prepared. Nuclei were lysed using lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's post hoc multiple comparisons test or Student's t test using In Stat software. Identification and Mutagenesis of the Putative NLS in GSK3β—GSK3β contains a region of 38 amino acids consisting of residues 85–123 that is rich in lysine and arginine (32%), which we hypothesized may encompass an NLS (Fig. 1A). An important feature of an NLS is that it must be externally exposed so that it can bind to nuclear import proteins. The crystal structure of GSK3β (17Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) shows that this putative NLS domain forms an external loop, indicating that it is easily accessible to proteins involved in the intracellular transport of GSK3β (Fig. 1B). To begin to test if this region contains an NLS, several of the basic amino acids were mutated to alanine or glycine. These mutated constructs of GSK3β containing HA tags included K85A,K86A-GSK3β-HA, R96A-GSK3β-HA, R102G,K103A-GSK3β-HA, and K122A,K123A-GSK3β-HA. Each GSK3β construct included an HA tag because this slows electrophoretic mobility of the protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, allowing the expressed GSK3β constructs to be distinguished from endogenous GSK3β on Western blots. Each GSK3β construct was expressed in HEK293 cells, and Western blot analysis demonstrated that expression levels were equivalent to expressed wild-type GSK3β-HA and that the expression of GSK3β constructs did not alter the level of endogenous GSK3β (Fig. 1C). Additionally, the phosphorylation status at serine 9 and tyrosine 216 of each GSK3β construct was examined using site-specific phosphorylation-dependent antibodies. The serine 9 phosphorylation level of wild-type GSK3β-HA and each of the mutants paralleled expression levels of each construct with the exception of K85A,K86A-GSK3β-HA, which exhibited relatively less serine 9 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Similarly, the tyrosine 216 phosphorylation of wild-type GSK3β-HA and each of the mutants was approximately equivalent with the exception of K85A,K86A-GSK3β, which displayed no detectable phosphorylation at tyrosine 216 (Fig. 1D). This is in accordance with previous evidence that mutation of the Lys85 residue results in a kinase-dead protein (18He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and that phosphorylation of GSK3β at tyrosine 216 is due to autophosphorylation (19Cole A. Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To test if these mutations affected GSK3β activity, the kinase activity of each mutant was measured using a phosphoglycogen synthase peptide as a primed substrate. Each construct was expressed in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated with an HA antibody. K85A,K86A-GSK3β-HA had essentially no activity toward phosphoglycogen synthase (Fig. 1E), consistent with evidence that mutation of the Lys85 residue eliminates kinase activity (18He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Similarly, R96A-GSK3β-HA had little activity toward phosphoglycogen synthase, consistent with reports that Arg96 is required for GSK3β to bind and phosphorylate primed substrates (12Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). However, R96A-GSK3β retained catalytic activity toward the unprimed substrate recombinant Tau (not shown), as reported previously (20Cho J.H. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Using phosphoglycogen synthase as the substrate, R102G,K103A-GSK3β-HA and K122A, K123A-GSK3β-HA retained ∼70 and 85%, respectively, of the wild-type GSK3β activity. Amino Acids 85–103 Contain Residues Required for Nuclear Localization of GSK3β—To test if the nuclear localization of GSK3β was dependent on the lysines and arginines within the 85–123 putative NLS region, each construct was expressed in HEK293 cells in parallel with wild-type GSK3β-HA, and their distributions between the nucleus and cytosol were compared after subcellular fractionation. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were immunoblotted for CREB as a nuclear marker and α-tubulin as a cytosolic marker, and no CREB was detected in the cytosolic fractions and no α-tubulin was detected in the nuclear fractions, verifying efficient isolation of these fractions (Fig. 2A). Wild-type GSK3β-HA was localized in both the nucleus and the cytosol (Fig. 2B). In marked contrast, K85A,K86A-GSK3β-HA was completely excluded from the nucleus. Similarly, R96A-GSK3β-HA and R102G,K103A-GSK3β-HA also were excluded from the nucleus. However, K122A,K123A-GSK3β-HA was distributed in both the nucleus and the cytosol to the same extent as wild-type GSK3β-HA, indicating that Lys122 and Lys123 are not required for the nuclear import of GSK3β. These results indicated that a sequence extending from Lys85 to Lys103, but not to Lys123, may constitute an NLS for GSK3β. To test if the subcellular localization of GSK3β constructs was independent of cell type, immunofluorescent microscopy and immunoblotting were used to examine the localization of each mutant in HeLa cells. Consistent with the results from HEK293 cells, K85A,K86A-GSK3β-HA, R96A-GSK3β-HA, and R102G,K103A-GSK3β-HA were largely excluded from the nucleus, whereas K122A,K123A-GSK3β and wild-type GSK3β-HA were readily detectable in the nucleus (Fig. 2, C–E). These data confirm the conclusion that mutations of Lys85 and Lys86, Arg96, or Arg102 and Lys103 impair the nuclear localization of GSK3β. To verify that these mutations in GSK3β impair nuclear import, rather than facilitate nuclear export, the subcellular localization of GSK3β was measured in HeLa cells treated with leptomycin B to inhibit CRM-1-dependent nuclear export, which has been reported to cause nuclear accumulation of endogenous GSK3β (2Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This result was confirmed, since endogenous GSK3β accumulated in the nucleus of HeLa cells treated with leptomycin B for 5 h (Fig. 2F). However, little nuclear accumulation of expressed wild-type GSK3β or K122A,K123A-GSK3β-HA occurred following treatment with leptomycin B, suggesting that overexpression may circumvent the CRM-1 export mechanism. Nevertheless, even with leptomycin B treatment, little, if any, K85A,K86A-GSK3β-HA, R96A-GSK3β-HA, or R102G, K103A-GSK3β-HA was detected in the nucleus (Fig. 2G), indicating that these mutations impede nuclear import. Amino Acids 85–103 Are Sufficient for Nuclear Localization—The previous findings demonstrated that the region of GSK3β consisting of amino acids 85–103 may be an NLS. In order to test if this domain meets the criteria for an NLS of being sufficient to induce nuclear localization, a YFP fusion protein was constructed containing residues 85–103 of GSK3β on the C terminus (YFP-NLS). Expressed wild-type YFP visualized in live cells was present diffusely throughout the cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, YFP-NLS preferentially accumulated in the nucleus. Measurements of the nuclear and cytosolic distributions of YFP and YFP-NLS demonstrated that the NLS was sufficient to drive the majority of the YFP-NLS into the nucleus in virtually all cells (Fig. 3B). Taken together with the data shown in Fig. 2, these results confirm that the region of GSK3β consisting of amino acids 85–103 is a bona fide bipartite NLS. GSK3 or its homologue is found in most eukaryotes. To determine if the NLS of human GSK3β is conserved, the sequences of several GSK3 homologues were compared. Alignment of the GSK3 sequences from several species demonstrated that the region containing the NLS, and particularly the identified critical basic residues, is highly conserved (Fig. 3C). The N Terminus of GSK3 Contributes to Regulating Nuclear GSK3β—The crystal structure and biochemical evidence indicate that the N terminus of GSK3β interacts with the primed substrate binding site through an intramolecular interaction (12Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 17Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The primed binding site and the NLS overlap, indicating that the N terminus of GSK3β can interact with the NLS. Therefore, we considered the possibility that the N terminus of GSK3β might contribute to modulating the function of the NLS. To test this, two mutants of GSK3β were used: conversion of serine 9 to alanine (S9A-GSK3β-HA) to test if serine 9 phosphorylation is regulatory and truncation of the first 9 amino acids (Δ9-GSK3β-HA) to test if the N-terminal tail contributes to the function of the NLS. Wild-type GSK3β and each mutant were expressed in HeLa cells and immunoblots using anti-HA demonstrated equivalent expression levels of all three, and phospho-Ser9-GSK3β immunoblots verified the absence of serine 9 in the two mutant constructs (Fig. 4A). HeLa (Fig. 4B) or HEK293 (Fig. 4C) cells expressing wild-type GSK3β-HA, S9A-GSK3β-HA, or Δ9-GSK3β-HA were separated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions, and these were immunoblotted for GSK3β-HA. The levels of wild-type GSK3β-HA and S9A-GSK3β-HA were equivalent in the nucleus, but the level of Δ9-GSK3β-HA in the nucleus was 40% lower than wild-type GSK3β-HA. Localization in HeLa cells was also examined by immunocytochemistry, and this corroborated the biochemical finding of impaired nuclear localizat"

https://openalex.org/W2122324859,"The increasing spread of plasmid-borne ampC-ampR operons is of considerable medical importance, since the AmpC β-lactamases they encode confer high level resistance to many third generation cephalosporins. Induction of AmpC β-lactamase from endogenous or plasmid-borne ampC-ampR operons is mediated by a catabolic inducer molecule, 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) tripeptide, an intermediate of the cell wall recycling pathway derived from the peptidoglycan. Here we describe a strategy for attenuating the antibiotic resistance associated with the ampC-ampR operon by blocking the formation of the inducer molecule using small molecule inhibitors of NagZ, the glycoside hydrolase catalyzing the formation of this inducer molecule. The structure of the NagZ-inhibitor complex provides insight into the molecular basis for inhibition and enables the development of inhibitors with 100-fold selectivity for NagZ over functionally related human enzymes. These PUGNAc-derived inhibitors reduce the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for several clinically relevant cephalosporins in both wild-type and AmpC-hyperproducing strains lacking functional AmpD. The increasing spread of plasmid-borne ampC-ampR operons is of considerable medical importance, since the AmpC β-lactamases they encode confer high level resistance to many third generation cephalosporins. Induction of AmpC β-lactamase from endogenous or plasmid-borne ampC-ampR operons is mediated by a catabolic inducer molecule, 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) tripeptide, an intermediate of the cell wall recycling pathway derived from the peptidoglycan.

The expression of inducible chromosomal AmpC β-lactamases (1Normark S. Ghuysen-M. J Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall: New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 27. 1994: 485-503Google Scholar, 2Jacobs C. Huang L.J. Bartowsky E. Normark S. Park J.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) is one increasingly problematic resistance mechanism seen in many Gram-negative bacteria, including clinically opportunistic pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Citrobacter freundii. These AmpC β-lactamases inactivate a broad range of β-lactam antibiotics, thereby conferring resistance to clinically important cephamycins, cephalosporins, and even monobactams, next generation β-lactams designed to be stable against β-lactamases (3Jacoby G.A. Munoz-Price L.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). One alarming development resulting from continued β-lactam use is the spread of genetically diverse, plasmid-borne ampC, including those that are under inducible control. Indeed, the movement of ampC genes onto plasmids (4Bradford P.A. Urban C. Mariano N. Projan S.J. Rahal J.J. Bush K. Antimicrob.

Chemother. 2001; 47: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as well as other transposable elements has greatly increased the prevalence of this type of resistance mechanism in Gram-negative organisms (9Woodford N. Reddy S. Fagan E.J. Hill R.L. Hopkins K.L. Kaufmann M.E. Kistler J. Palepou M.F. Pike R. Ward M.E. Cheesbrough J. Livermore D.M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2006; 59: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The regulation of ampC gene expression can vary between genera of Gram-negative bacteria. In some, chromosomal ampC is expressed constitutively, although high level expression has been suggested to decrease bacterial fitness and virulence, at least in Salmonella enterica (10Folkesson A. Eriksson S. Andersson M. Park J.T. Normark S. Cell. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Often, however, chromosomal ampC β-lactamase is inducible as found in various clinically relevant opportunistic pathogens, such as Enterobacter spp., and P. aeruginosa (11Hanson N.D. Sanders C.C. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 881-894PubMed Google Scholar, 12Poirel L. Guibert M. Girlich D. Naas T. Nordmann P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 769-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major achievement in the field of antibiotic research has been the discovery of β-lactamase inhibitors. These inhibitors have been shown, in some cases, to reverse antibiotic resistance mediated by certain classes of β-lactamase. There are currently three main β-lactamase inhibitors available on the market, each having the same β-lactam core found in β-lactam antibiotics. One of these inhibitors, clavulanic acid, however has been found to be of limited use against AmpC (13Livermore D.M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 557-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Li C. Nicolau D.P. Lister P.D. Quintiliani R. Nightingale C.H. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2004; 53: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The other two, sulbactam and tazobactam, demonstrate effectiveness against certain bacteria, but their general utility against AmpC remains unclear (13Livermore D.M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 557-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kadima T.A. Weiner J.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2177-2183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Doi Y. Wachino J. Ishiguro M.

Accordingly, the development of new strategies to cope with the growing problem of AmpC β-lactamases are of considerable interest and importance. The mechanism by which inducible AmpC β-lactamase expression is controlled is directly related to the integrity of the murein cell wall. This regulatory mechanism elegantly links antibiotic resistance to the dynamic and continuously changing balance between peptidoglycan biosynthesis and degradation (Fig. 1). These two metabolic activities must be strictly controlled by bacteria to enable cell growth yet avoid autolysis (20Jacobs C. Frere J-M. Normark S. Cell. 1997; 88: 823-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). During cell division, a considerable amount of the murein sacculus is degraded by various autolysins and recycled (21Vollmer W. Holtje J.V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Park J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GlcNAc-1,6-anhydro-MurNAc 2The abbreviations used are: MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration. peptide degradation products liberated by these autolysins are transported into the cytosol (2Jacobs C. Huang L.J. Bartowsky E. Normark S. Park J.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), where, upon arrival, the nonreducing GlcNAc residue is removed by a family 3 β-glucosaminidase known as NagZ. The resulting products are N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and a series of 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptides (Fig. 2) (23Cheng Q. Li H. Merdek K. Park J.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4836-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Votsch W. Templin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39032-39038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These structurally unusual 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc catabolic fragments activate the transcription of inducible ampC. Acting in an antagonistic manner, UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide, a biosynthetic building block of the cell wall derived from these catabolic products, is involved in transcriptional repression of ampC. The dynamic balance between the concentrations of these catabolic and anabolic molecules is how these bacteria sense β-lactams and accordingly regulate transcription of ampC.FIGURE 2A, NagZ-catalyzed hydrolysis of murein cell wall fragments releases two monosaccharide fragments, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and the series of 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptide inducer molecules that activate transcription of ampC expression. B, structures of the inhibitors studied here. C, the putative transition state of the NagZ-catalyzed hydrolysis of N-acetylglucosaminides (denoted by a double dagger).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nexus linking these two molecules with the transcription of ampC is AmpR (25Lindberg F. Westman L. Normark S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4620-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a member of the large family of LysR transcriptional regulators (26Henikoff S. Haughn G.W. Calvo J.M. Wallace J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6602-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). ampC and ampR are together found in a divergent operon in which ampR is located directly upstream of ampC. The promoters for these two genes overlap, and AmpR binds to this region, thereby regulating transcription of ampC (27Bartowsky E. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the absence of β-lactams, UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide is believed to bind to AmpR and promote a conformation in the protein that prevents transcription of ampC (20Jacobs C. Frere J-M. Normark S. Cell. 1997; 88: 823-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 28Uehara T. Park J.T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4233-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When β-lactams are present, murein biosynthesis is disrupted, the delicate balance between the inducer and repressor molecules is perturbed (21Vollmer W. Holtje J.V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Pfeifle D. Janas E. Wiedemann B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc oligopeptides accumulate in the cytoplasm. One of these compounds, believed to be 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc tripeptide, 3There is some conjecture as to what 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc oligopeptide is involved in the induction process. The 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc tripeptide and the 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc pentapeptide have both been thought to induce ampC transcription (2Jacobs C. Huang L.J. Bartowsky E. Normark S. Park J.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). is thought to competitively displace UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide from AmpR and thereby induce an alternate conformation that now activates transcription of ampC (20Jacobs C. Frere J-M. Normark S. Cell. 1997; 88: 823-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To avoid overproduction of AmpC, bacteria limit the intracellular concentration of the inducer molecule by degrading and recycling it via the action of AmpD, a cytoplasmic N-acetyl-muramyl-l-alanine amidase (30Holtje J.V. Kopp U. Ursinus A. Wiedemann B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 122: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 31Jacobs C. Joris B. Jamin M. Klarsov K. Van Beeumen J. MenginLecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Park J.T Normark S. Frere J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that cleaves the stem peptide off of both the GlcNAc-1,6-anhydro-MurNAc tripeptide as well as the inducer 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc tripeptide (30Holtje J.V. Kopp U. Ursinus A. Wiedemann B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 122: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 31Jacobs C. Joris B. Jamin M. Klarsov K. Van Beeumen J.

Clinical resistance to extended spectrum (third generation) β-lactams seen in many strains of Gram-negative bacteria most commonly arises from loss-of-function mutations in the ampD gene (32Juan C. Macia M.D. Gutierrez O. Vidal C. Perez J.L. Oliver A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 33Reisbig M.D. Hossain A. Hanson N.D. J.

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These mutations dramatically increase the cytosolic concentration of 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc oligopeptides and lead to constitutive AmpC expression (36Lindberg F. Lindquist S. Normark S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1923-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The presence of NagZ activity in a common Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli, was first reported over 20 years ago (37Yem D.W. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 324-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it has only recently been shown that deletion of the nagZ gene from bacteria harboring the ampC-ampR operon increases their susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics (23Cheng Q. Li H. Merdek K. Park J.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4836-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Votsch W. Templin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39032-39038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a strategy to attenuate β-lactam resistance within pathogens harboring ampC-ampR. By blocking formation of the inducer molecule through inhibition of NagZ, induction of AmpC β-lactamase should be prevented, with the net effect being enhanced efficacy of β-lactam antibiotics. Accordingly, inhibition of NagZ during treatment of certain resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections could rescue many classes of β-lactam antibiotics. An effective strategy would be of particular importance for treating immuno-compromised patients suffering from chronic infection by opportunistic Gram-negative pathogens as well as for certain infections in immunocompetent patients. P. aeruginosa, for example, is known to rapidly develop resistance to β-lactams through high level production of an inducible chromosomally encoded AmpC β-lactamase and typically requires aggressive treatments using aminoglycoside or quinolone antibiotics that are somewhat toxic. Reagents, Enzymes, Chemical Techniques, and Bacterial Strains—All media components were obtained from Bioshop. Pfu DNA polymerase, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and restriction endonucleases were obtained from Fermentas. T4 DNA ligase was purchased from New England Biolabs. E. coli ultracompetent XL-10 Gold and XL-10 Gold Kan® cells were purchased from Stratagene. E. coli Tuner (λDE3) cells were purchased from Novagen. HisTrap FF columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. DNA fragment purification and plasmid purification kits were obtained from Qiagen. Synthesis of oligonucleotide primers for the C. freundii ampR-ampC operon cloning was performed by Sigma and, in the case of the V. cholerae NagZ, Invitrogen. DNA sequencing was performed by the Nucleic Acids and Peptide Service facility, University of British Columbia. All bacterial strains used in the antibiotic testing were provided by the NARA Institute of Science and Technology and the E. coli Genetic Stock Center. All solvents were dried prior to use. Synthetic reactions were monitored by TLC using Merck Kieselgel 60 F254 aluminum-backed sheets. Compounds were detected by charring with a 10% concentrated sulfuric acid in ethanol solution and heating. Flash chromatography under a positive pressure was performed with Merck Kieselgel 60 (230-400 mesh) using specified eluants. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian AS500 Unity Innova spectrometer at 500 MHz (125 MHz for 13C) (chemical shifts quoted relative to CD3OD where appropriate). Elemental analyses of all synthesized compounds used in enzyme assays were performed at the Simon Fraser University Analytical Facility. Cloning and Expression Vector Construction for NagZ V. cholerae—The V. cholerae NAGZ gene (GenBank™ AE004155) was amplified by the PCR using VENT polymerase from a V. cholerae subgenomic clone (ATCC 638129). The sense primer 5′-GATATACATATGGGACCGCTTTGGTTGGATG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GATATAGGATCCCTAATGATGGTGATGGTGATGATGATGATGATGTTCGGAGAACTGCTCG-3′ were used to introduce an in-frame C-terminal His10 purification tag and 5′-NdeI and 3′-BamHI restriction sites (shown in boldface type) onto the PCR amplicon. The amplicon was restricted with NdeI and BamHI restriction endonucleases, ligated into a modified version of pET28 (Novagen) (containing a reduced multicloning site composed of NdeI/SpeI/BamH1 only) using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation reaction was transformed into chemically competent E. coli strain BL21 (λDE3) GOLD HTE cells (Stratagene). Recombinant plasmid was isolated from a single kanamycin-resistant transformant and verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing to confirm the successful construction and correct sequence of the C-terminal His10-tagged VcNagZ expression construct pVcNagZ. Protein Expression and Purification of V. cholerae NagZ—E. coli BL21 (λDE3) Gold cells harboring pVcNagZ were grown to log phase (A600 = 0.5) in a shaker incubator at 37 °C in 2 × 500 ml of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 35 μg/ml kanamycin. Expression of recombinant NagZ from log phase cultures was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside followed by a 4-h incubation at 28 °C with shaking. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. The induced pellets were thawed in 20 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μl of protease inhibitor mixture for His-tagged proteins (Sigma) and lysed by French press. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer (1 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of binding buffer followed by two additional washes of binding buffer supplemented with 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, respectively. The NagZ protein was eluted from the column using binding buffer supplemented with 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. The eluate was then dialyzed overnight against 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, containing 10% glycerol. All centrifugations, chromatographic steps, and dialysis were conducted at 4 °C. Crystallization and Cryogenic Preservation for V. cholerae—Purified VcNagZ was concentrated to 6.5 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra centricon spin cartridge and crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion within 1 week using mother liquor conditions based on the Protein Data Bank entry 1Y65. In our laboratory, optimal crystal growth occurred in 15% polyethylene glycol 20,000, and 100 mm BisTris, pH 5.8. Crystals of VcNagZ in complex with PUGNAc were obtained by first mixing PUGNAc with concentrated VcNagZ at a 10:1 molar ratio of inhibitor to protein for 30 min at room temperature and then subjecting the mixture to hanging drop vapor diffusion using 13% polyethylene glycol 20,000, and 100 mm BisTris, pH 6.1, as mother liquor. After equilibration against the mother liquor overnight at room temperature, the drops were streak-seeded with native VcNagZ crystal particles to induce the growth of the NagZ-PUGNAc co-crystals. Diffraction quality crystals of the complex grew within 2 weeks and were transferred into cryoprotectant by soaking in 13% polyethylene glycol 20,000, and 100 mm BisTris, pH 6.1, with increasing concentrations of glycerol until a final glycerol concentration of 25-30% was achieved. The crystals were then flash-cooled by submerging them directly into liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected using an RAXIS VI++ detector from single crystals of the NagZ-PUGNAc complex held at 100 K in a N2 stream. Collected intensities were processed using Mosflm/CCP4 and Scala/CCP4 (38Leslie A.

Prior to refinement, a random subset (5%) of hkl indices was flagged for cross-validation against the free R-factor (41Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). One NagZ molecule was located in the asymmetric unit and was subjected to rigid body refinement followed by multiple rounds of model rebuilding and restrained refinement using O (42Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 (43Steiner R.A. Lebedev A.A. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr.

Before the addition of solvent molecules, σ-A weighted Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc electron density maps clearly showed the presence of PUGNAc bound within the NagZ active site. A model of PUGNAc was fit into this density using O and refined using REFMAC5. Solvent molecules were then added using COOT (44Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Kinetic Analysis of NagZ from V. cholerae—All assays were carried out in triplicate at 37 °C using a continuous assay procedure by following the linear rate of liberation of 4-nitrophenolate as determined by absorption measurements at 400 nm. Reactions (80 μl) were initiated by the addition, via syringe, of enzyme (5 μl) and monitored for 4 min. Time-dependent assay of NagZ revealed that the enzyme was stable in the buffer over the period of the assay: 50 mm NaPi, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 6.5. VcNagZ was used at a concentration of 0.075 μg μl-1 with pNP-GlcNAc as a substrate at a concentration of 0.5 mm. All inhibitors were tested at seven concentrations ranging from 3 times to ⅓ KI. KI values were determined by linear regression of data from Dixon plots. Cloning of ampC-ampR Operon from C. freundii—Genomic DNA from C. freundii was used as the template for cloning of ampC-ampR operon. The PCR was accomplished using the following primers 5′-GCGTATAAGCTTCTGCAGCAACGACGGGCAGAA-3′ (HindIII cut site shown in boldface type) and 5′-GCGTATGTCGACCCTGACCGTTGTAACGGCGAT-3′ (SalI cut site shown in boldface type). The amplicon was restricted with NdeI and BamH1 restriction endonucleases, ligated into a modified version of pET28 (Novagen) (containing a reduced multicloning site composed of NdeI/SpeI/BamH1 only) using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixture was used directly to transform E. coli ultracompetent cells Kan®, using plates containing 30 μg/ml of chloramphenicol. Recombinant plasmid was isolated from a single chloramphenicol-resistant transformant and verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing to confirm the successful construction and correct sequence of the ampC-ampR operon. Determination of the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration of β-Lactams—Cultures were prepared by inoculating 5 ml of Mueller-Hinton broth with a small amount of the desired glycerol stock of bacteria and allowed to grow at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.5. 96-Well plates containing a range of concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics varying by factors of 2 were prepared containing 80 μl of the appropriate concentration of antibiotic in Mueller-Hinton Broth. The volume was made up to 100 μl by the addition of either 20 μl of EtBuPUG (5 mm in H2O) or 20 μl of H2O. These broths were inoculated with 100 μl of the desired culture and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 18 h. The optical density measured at 595 nm was measured for all cultures, and the MIC was determined from the concentration of antibiotic at which no growth was observed. All MIC determinations were performed in triplicate. Agar Diffusion Tests—The appropriate bacterial culture was prepared by inoculating 5 ml of Mueller-Hinton Broth with the appropriate glycerol stock, and the culture was allowed to grow at 37 °C until the A600 reached ∼0.5. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (Eppendorf 5417C) for 3 min at 13,000 r.p.m. The cells were then resuspended in 2 ml of Mueller-Hinton broth, and 500 μl of this suspension was used to in"

Rho is known to be a critical regulator of actin stress fiber formation. Nonetheless, Rho was reported to no longer couple to loss of actin stress fibers in Ras-transformed Swiss3T3 cells despite the elevation of Rho activity. In this study, however, we demonstrate that Rho is inactivated in K-Ras-transformed normal rat kidney cells, and that abrogation of Nox1-generated ROS by Nox1 small interference RNAs or diphenyleneiodonium restores Rho activation, suggesting that Nox1-generated oxidants mediate down-regulation of the Rho activity. This down-regulation involves oxidative inactivation of the low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase by Nox1-generated ROS and a subsequent elevation in the tyrosine-phosphorylated active form of p190RhoGAP, the direct target of the phosphatase. Furthermore, the decreased Rho activity leads to disruption of both actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in Ras-transformed cells. As for Rac1, Rac1 also appears to participate in the down-regulation of Rho via Nox1.

Exp. Mol. Med. 1999; 31: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 2Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that membrane-associated flavoprotein complexes NADPH oxidases are, at least in part, responsible for these ROS productions and that their catalytic subunits constitute a family of Nox enzymes (Nox1-5 and Duox) homologous to gp91phox of a phagocytic oxidase (3Lambeth J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref Scopus (2439) Google Scholar). The Nox proteins catalyze transfer of electrons from NADPH to O2 to generate superoxide O2.¯, which is rapidly dismutated to H2O2. Each Nox homologue exhibits a distinct cellular and tissue distribution pattern (3Lambeth J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref Scopus (2439) Google Scholar), suggesting that Nox isozymes may possess distinct, specific functional roles in cells. In terms of relationships with cancer development, elevated ROS production has been recognized in various malignant cells and Nox4 and Nox5 have been implicated in survival of tumor cells (4Brar S.S.

Konagai A. Hirose K. Kiyosawa K. Kamata T. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). As for Nox1, we demonstrated that the Ras oncogene induces constitutive expression of Nox1 through the Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway and that Nox1-generated ROS exert an essential mediating role for Ras oncogene transformation phenotypes including augmented cell growth, altered cell morphology, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenesis (8Mitsushita J. Lambeth J.D. Kamata T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3580-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This appears to account for the biological significance of elevated superoxide production observed in Ras-transformed cells (9Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). The signaling pathway downstream of Nox1 involved in transformation remains to be established. Regarding actin cytoskeleton organization, ROS have long been implicated in cell migration and adhesion of endothelial cells (10Moldovan L. Nicanor I. Moldovan R.H. Parkin S.A. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Van Wetering S. Van Buul J.D. Ouick S. Mul F.P.J. Anthony E.C. Klooater J.-P. Gollared J.G. Hordijik P.L. J. Cell. Sci. 2002; 115: 1837-1846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the detailed mechanism has not been clarified at the molecular level. Recent study has shown that during integrin-induced cell spreading in HeLa cells, integrin triggers Rac1-dependent ROS production, which in turn inactivates LMW-PTP through oxidation, accumulates the tyrosine-phosphorylated, active form of p190RhoGAP, its direct target, and leads to down-regulation of Rho (12Nimunal A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In the Nimunal et al. (12Nimunal A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) study, they showed the involvement of Rac1-dependent ROS generation in regulation of Rho by utilizing the Rac1-ΔIns mutant lacking a carboxyl-terminal effector-binding site that is required for activation of Nox2 (gp91phox) (13Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17991-17994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The observation therefore seemed to indicate Nox2 as a critical oxidase in the cell spreading process. Recently, Rac1 was found to interact with not only Nox2 but also Nox1 among the Nox family enzymes (14Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 15Park H.S. Lee S.H. Park D. Lee L.S. Ryu S.H. Lee W.J. Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4384-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The mode of interaction with Rac1 could be different between the two Nox proteins because of the following reasons. First, Nox1 is structurally diverged from Nox2 although the catalytic domain is well conserved (16Suh Y.-A. Rebecca S.A. Lasseque B. Shi J. Xiangxi X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Second, Nox1 and Nox2 require structurally distinct accessory proteins for their activities: NOXO1 and NOXA1 assemble with Nox1, whereas p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox with Nox2 (17Sumimoto H. Miyano K. Takeya R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Finally, Nox1 is constitutively activated by Rac1, whereas Nox2 is activated through Rac1 in response to ligand stimulation (18Cheng G. Diebold B.A. Hughes Y. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17718-17726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, direct identification of the Nox protein involved is of critical importance for understanding the mechanism of Rac1-regulated redox signaling. In the present study, we focus on the role of Nox1-generated ROS production in changes of stress fiber formation and stabilization of cell adhesions upon Ras oncogene transformation. Two issues have to be considered. Contrasting with cell spreading in which integrin engagement to fibronectin induces ROS generation (12Nimunal A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), Ras transformation prevents cell adhesions to the substrates by down-regulating integrins (19Hughes R.E. Penshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 1997: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (434) Google Scholar). As far as integrin action is concerned, the opposing events proceed between the two biological systems. Thus, a distinct mode of intracellular ROS-mediated signaling could be expected for Ras transformation compared with cell spreading. Another issue is contribution of Rho family GTPases to loss of both stress fibers and cell adhesions characteristic of Ras-transformed cells. Despite a number of reports on morphological transformation, it is not well understood how Rho signaling is required for altered control of cytoskeletons in the transformed cells. Recently, Sahai et al. (20Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) have reported that H-Ras transformation activated Rho in Swiss-3T3 cells, and that activated Rho subsequently suppressed the cell cycle inhibitor p21waf involved in growth control (21Olson M.F. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Activated Rho no longer coupled to formation of actin stress fibers in the transformed cells. Instead, sustained ERK-MAPK signaling resulting from Ras activation down-regulated ROCK, leading to loss of stress fibers. Whereas the discovery unravels the unique cross-talk between Ras and Rho signaling, there might exist a different mechanism in K-Ras transformation of normal rat kidney cells where Rho is inactivated (the present study). We demonstrate that K-Ras transformation reduces the level of active RhoGTP, and that depletion of Nox1-generated ROS reverts the reduction of the RhoGTP amount, suggesting the mediating role of Nox1-generated ROS in down-regulation of Rho. Furthermore, Nox1-generated ROS suppress the LMW-PTP-p190RhoGAP pathway and thereby inactivate Rho, leading to loss of stress fiber formation and focal adhesions. Unexpectedly, our study demonstrates that despite the loss of integrin dependence, oncogenic K-Ras transformation down-regulates Rho via a LMW-PTP and p190RhoGAP-dependent mechanism. In addition, our discovery, unlike the model described by Sahai et al. (20Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), reveals a new mechanism involving the Nox1-redox signaling-mediated down-regulation of Rho for altered stress fibers and focal adhesions in Ras-transformed cells. Cell Culture and Materials—Normal rat kidney fibroblast (NRK) cells and Kirstein-Ras-transformed NRK (KNRK) cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

Shiota M. Yamada N. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Kim S. Miyazaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24-36 h after infection and subjected to various assays.

Cells (5 × 105) were infected with Ad-HA-tagged wt-LMW-PTP for 24 h and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF) under anaerobic conditions. Lysates were clarified by a centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The labeling reaction was performed by the addition of 10 μm iodoacetamide-fluorescein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to lysates for 60 min at 4 °C. The labeled HA-wt-LMW-PTP proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-fluorescein antibodies and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species—Production of reactive oxygen species was measured by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay as described before (8Mitsushita J. Lambeth J.D. Kamata T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3580-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In addition, luminol luminescence assay was used in some experiments. Cells were inoculated into 24-well plates and transfected with 250 pmol of scrambled RNAi or Rac1 siRNA. After 48 h, cells were washed once with Hanks' buffer and incubated with Hanks' buffer containing 0.8 unit of horseradish peroxidase and 200 μm luminol for 20 min at 37 °C. Luminescence was quantified using luminescencer-PSN (Atto, Tokyo). Phosphatase Activity Assay—The assay was performed by modification of the published method (26Chiarugi P. Fiaschi T. Taddei M.L.

After clarification by high speed centrifugation, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies and immunoprecipitates of LMW-PTP were incubated with 100 μl of reaction buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 10 mm EDTA) containing p-nitrophenyl phosphate (5 mm) as a substrate for 60 min at 37 °C. The production of p-nitrophenol was measured colorimetrically at 410 nm. Isolation of Membranes—Cells were sonicated in hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF) for a few seconds. The lysates were fractionated by low speed centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min, followed by a high speed centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min. Isolated crude membrane pellets were solubilized in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF) and clarified by high speed centrifugation. The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. Oncogenic Ras Signaling Down-regulates the Rho Activity through Nox1—We first determined whether Nox1 affects the activity of Rho in KNRK cells. The Rho activity was monitored by the GST-rhotekin pull-down assay in which active GTP·Rho complexes are selectively bound to GST proteins fused with the Rho-binding domain of rhotekin (GST-RBD). The Rho activity was down-regulated in KNRK cells compared with untransformed NRK cells (Fig. 1A). There are discrepant reports about the changes in the activity of Rho GTPase observed in Ras-transformed cells. Whereas the Rho activity is increased in Ras-transformed MDCK cells (27Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. Vander Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and Ras-transformed Swiss-3T3 cells (20Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), Rho appears to be inactivated in HB4A human mammary epithelial cells (20Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and Ras-transformed Rat1 fibroblasts (28Izawa I. Amano M. Chihara K. Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2863-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is not exactly understood at present and might reflect the difference in cellular and genetic backgrounds. When KNRK cells were treated with DPI, a specific flavoprotein inhibitor, an increase in Rho activity was detected (Fig. 1B). Consistent with this, Rho activity was enhanced in the KNRK cell lines stably expressing different small interfering Nox1 RNA sequences (KNRKsiNox1 and KNRKsiNox1-M) compared with a KNRK cell line carrying scrambled siRNA (Fig. 1C). Consistent with this, actin stress fibers and focal adhesions were restored in both clones (see below). As the results make it very unlikely that the observed effects of siRNAs are the results of an unusual cell clone or off-target effect from the siRNAs used, we mostly focus on KNRKsiNox1 cells in the subsequent study. Our previous study demonstrated that generation of superoxide is augmented in KNRK cells compared with NRK cells due to constitutive induction of Nox1 expression by Ras oncogenes via the Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway (8Mitsushita J. Lambeth J.D. Kamata T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3580-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this increased oxidant production was abolished by silencing Nox1 in KNRKsiNox1 cells (Fig. 1, D and E). We therefore conclude that Nox1-produced ROS are required for down-regulation of Rho by activated Ras. In the control experiment, treatment of KNRK cells with a MAPKK inhibitor, PD98059, increased the amount of GTP-Rho (Fig. 1F), indicating that inhibition of MAPK signaling restores Rho activity, which is in agreement with our speculation (Fig. 6) that Ras-MAPK signaling down-regulates Rho activity through induction of Nox1. In an attempt to relate Rac to the regulation of Rho activity, we examined the level of GTP·Rac1 in KNRK cells by using the GST-PAK-1 pull-down assay. The data show that the level GTP·Rac1 decreased in KNRK cells compared with NRK cells (Fig. 1G), demonstrating that oncogenic Ras down-regulates the Rac1 activity. We next sought to determine whether this low level of GTP·Rac1 still affects the regulation of Rho activity. siRNA-mediated inhibition of Rac1 restored the Rho activity in parallel with suppression of ROS generation in KNRK cells (Fig. 1, H and I). These data suggest that Rac1, although reduced in the active form, participates in down-regulation of the Rho activity together with oncogenic Ras-induced induction of Nox1. We next examined the biochemical signaling pathway linking Nox1 to negative regulation of Rho. Accumulating evidence indicates that ROS affect the steady-state level of tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases and their substrates through reversible inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (29Rhee S.G. Chang T.S. Bae Y.S. Lee S.R. Kang S.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: S211-S215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As for Rho regulation, p190RhoGAP, a GTPase activating protein for Rho is activated following tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in down-regulation of Rho (30Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We therefore explored the effect of Nox1 on tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP by estimating the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated p190RhoGAP. Immunoblotting analysis showed that DPI treatment of KNRK cells induced a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP, and that the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP was reduced in KNRKsiNox1 cells compared with KNRKscrambled cells (Fig. 2). Thus, Nox1-derived ROS could augment tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP, which presumably leads to down-regulation of Rho. Nox1 Signaling Causes Oxidative Inactivation of LMW-PTP—We next sought to identify a sensor for Nox1-generated ROS that transmits an activation signal to p190RhoGAP. Given recent observations that LMW-PTP deactivates p190RhoGAP and ROS can inactivate LMW-PTP through reversible oxidation of the SH-group of its essential Cys residue (26Chiarugi P. Fiaschi T. Taddei M.L. Talini D. Giannoni E. Raugei G. Ramoni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33478-33487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we investigated whether LMW-PTP is regulated by Nox1-produced ROS. To this end, we used the 5′-iodoacetamide fluorescein labeling approach in which the iodoacetamide derivative specifically alkylates a Cys-SH residue that is susceptible to oxidation by intracellular ROS (25Wu Y. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The labeling reaction was performed following infection of adv-HA-LMW-PTP into cells. The significant amount of labeled LMW-PTP was detected in KNRKsiNox1 cells, whereas little or no labeling of the protein was observed in KNRKscrambled cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the Cys-SH of LMW-PTP was oxidized by Nox1-generated ROS. To investigate whether this oxidation alters the activity of LMW-PTP, exogenously expressed HA-LMW-PTP was immunoprecipitated and the immune complexes were subjected to protein-tyrosine phosphatase assay. As expected, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity of LMW-PTP immunoprecipitates from KNRKsiNox1 cells was greater than that from KNRKscrambled cells (Fig. 3B). Together, these data support the notion that Nox1-generated ROS inactivate LMW-PTP through oxidation of the Cys-SH residue. In additional experiments, LMW-PTP was exogenously overexpressed in KNRKscrambled or KNRKsiNox1 cells and cell lysates were incubated with iodoacetic acid. LMW-PTP that is not exposed to ROS in KNRKsiNox1 cells will be irreversibly alkylated at the SH group of active Cys residues with iodoacetamide. By contrast, LMW-PTP in which active Cys residues have been oxidized by Nox1-generated ROS in KNRK-scrambled cells could be resistant to alkylation. When after recovery by dithiothreitol reduction, the activities of PTPs in cell lysates were assayed using poly(Glu 4W.-H. Shang, H. Miyazaki, and T. Kamata, unpublished data. -Tyr(P)) peptides as the substrate, PTPs oxidation in KNRKscrambled cells increased compared with KNRKsiNox1 cells by approximately 50%. 4W.-H. Shang, H. Miyazaki, and T. Kamata, unpublished data. This also suggests that Nox1-generated ROS are involved in regulation of PTPs. LMW-PTP Mediates Nox1-induced Down-regulation of Rho—To further assess the involvement of LMW-PTP in regulation of Rho by Nox1-redox signaling, we examined the effect of LMW-PTP overexpression on the Rho activity. KNRK cells overexpressing LMW-PTP reduced the active, tyrosine-phosphorylated form of p190RhoGAP (Fig. 3C) and in parallel increased the amount of active Rho·GTP (Fig. 3D), suggesting that overexpression of LMW-PTP bypassed the Nox1-dependent inactivation and reactivated Rho possibly through dephosphorylation of p190RhoGAP in KNRK cells. Our above experiment demonstrated Nox1-dependent oxidative inactivation of LMW-PTP (Fig. 3, A and B). Because H2O2 is known to cause oxidation of Cys12 and Cys17, the two vicinal cysteines in the catalytic pocket of LMW-PTP, to form a disulfide bond and thereby suppress its enzymatic activity (31Caselli A. Marzocchini R. Camici G. Manano G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32554-32560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it is most likely that a dominant-negative mutant at the active Cys residues of LMW-PTP mimics the effect of Nox1 on Rho signaling. When KNRKsiNox1 cells were transfected with LMW-PTPC12S, a catalytically inactive, Cys12 to Ser mutant of LMW-PTP, the Rho activity was significantly reduced (Fig. 3E). In contra"

We recently demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling occurs during myoblast differentiation in vivo. This signaling results in apoptosis in a subpopulation of myoblasts. In a cell culture model of myogenesis, inhibition of ER stress signaling blocked apoptosis and myoblast differentiation. To further examine the role of ER stress during myogenesis, we exposed cultured myoblasts to ER stress inducers during the transition from proliferation to differentiation. The stress inducers tunicamycin (an inhibitor of N-glycosylation in the ER) and thapsigargin (an inhibitor of ER-specific calcium ATPase) were used at doses that induce 40-50% apoptosis in myoblast cultures. Increased ER stress enhanced differentiation-associated apoptosis of myoblasts. It is likely that apoptosis induced by ER stress selectively eliminates vulnerable cells. We found that the surviving myoblast cells were even more resistant to apoptosis. Remarkably, the surviving cells efficiently differentiated into contracting myofibers that are rarely found in culture models of myogenesis. Our observations suggest that ER stress exerts a positive effect on myofiber formation, possibly mimicking the action of signals that drive apoptosis and differentiation in vivo. These results may provide important insight for developing therapies to improve myofiber formation."

In this study we examined the contribution of SDF-1 signaling to osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal C2C12 cells induced by bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2). Blocking SDF-1 signaling before BMP2 stimulation by treatment with siRNA, antibodies against SDF-1 or CXCR4, or the G-protein-coupled receptor inhibitor pertussis toxin strongly suppressed BMP2 induction of osteogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells, as evidenced by an early decrease in the expression of the myogenesis inhibitor Id1, the osteogenic master regulators Runx2 and Osx, the osteoblast-associated transcription factors JunB, Plzf, Msx2, and Dlx5, and later of the bone marker proteins osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase. Similarly, blocking SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling strongly inhibited BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation of ST2 bone marrow stromal cells.

Expression of SDF-1 and CXCR4 has also been detected in stem cells and various precursor cells, such as in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (22Kortesidis A. Zannettino A. Isenmann S.

Pietrzkowski Z. Peiper S. Janowska-Wieczorek A. Stem Cells. 2003; 21: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). SDF-1 and CXCR4 are predominantly expressed by these stem and precursor cells at a primitive stage, but their expression rapidly declines once cells commit to a differentiation pathway (22Kortesidis A.

Although a complex array of local paracrine and autocrine signaling molecules as well as physiochemical and mechanical stimuli is likely to be required for tissue repair and regeneration, these observations suggest that SDF-1 signaling contributes to the differentiation of stem and precursor cells. Among the local stimuli that are known to induce the osteogenic differentiation of stem and precursor cells are bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), which are growth factors originally identified from bovine bone based on their ability to induce de novo ectopic bone formation (31Chen D.

Biosci. 2004; 9: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, BMPs bind to type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors, and both the Smad and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling machinery relay the BMP signal from the cell surface to the nucleus to regulate target gene expression (31Chen D.

In this study we provide the first evidence for a critical role of SDF-1/CXCR4 in the differentiation of mesenchymal C2C12 and ST2 marrow stromal cells into osteoblastic cells after their treatment with BMP2. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant (r) BMP2 protein, rSDF-1 protein, anti-SDF-1, anti-CXCR4 neutralizing antibodies, and isotype-matched control antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). 12G5 anti-CXCR4 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 and Trizol reagent were obtained from Sigma. Reagents for reverse transcription were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), and those for real time PCR reactions were from Bio-Rad. Primary antibodies for specific detection of intracellular Smad1/5/8 proteins and phosphorylated (p) Smads1/5, MAPK components, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) and pErk1/2, p38, and pp38, were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). The secondary goat-anti rabbit IgG was obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagent was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—C2C12 myoblastic cells were acquired from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). ST2 marrow stromal cells were obtained from the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan). For maintenance of stock plates, C2C12 cells or ST2 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Identical culture conditions were used in experiments examining the role of SDF-1 signaling during BMP2-stimulated osteogenic differentiation, except that the serum concentration was lowered to 2% to reduce cell proliferation. rBMP2 protein or rSDF-1 protein was added at 300 ng/ml, anti-SDF-1 or anti-CXCR4 neutralizing antibody was added at 100 μg/ml, 12G5 antibody was added at 10 μg/ml, and AMD3100 was added at 630 μm unless indicated otherwise. The doses were selected for optimal signal transduction or inhibition based on the manufacturer's recommendations or previous publications (22Kortesidis A. Zannettino A. Isenmann S. Shi S. Lapidot T.

Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent, 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed (Applied Biosystems), and levels of target gene expression were quantified in real time PCR by using a MyiQ Single Color Real Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Relative expression of target genes was calculated based on ΔCT values, which are differences in the number of threshold cycles between the target gene and the housekeeping gene glyceraldehydes phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), as described previously (42Zhu W.

Subsequently, SDF-1 siRNA or control siRNA-transfected cells were stimulated with rBMP2 protein. GPCR Inhibition—C2C12 or ST2 cells were seeded overnight in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well.

Subsequently, PTX-treated cells were incubated with rBMP2 or rSDF-1 protein using the concentrations indicated above. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—The SBE-Luc reporter construct, in which BMP-specific Smad binding elements (SBE) are repeated 12 times (GCCG12) in an osteocalcin minimal promoter that drives the expression of the luciferase (Luc) gene, was obtained from Drs. Ming Zhao and Stephen Harris (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). The day before transfection, C2C12 cells were plated in 100-mm diameter culture dishes at 3 × 107 cells per dish and then co-transfected with SBE-Luc and a pCMV-βGal plasmid (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) at 5 μg each per dish by using a modified bovine serum mammalian transfection kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). After transfection, cells were divided into 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 107 cells per well and subsequently treated with rBMP2, rSDF-1, anti-SDF-1, anti-CXCR4, or in combination. Luciferase activities in cells were assessed 2 and 18 h after stimulation using a LMaxII luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized to the activity of β-galactosidase. Western Blotting—C2C12 cells were kept in low serum medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin overnight to render the cells quiescent. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with rBMP2-, anti-SDF-1-, or anti-CXCR4-neutralizing antibodies in serum-free medium. Cell lysates were collected in lysis buffer (5 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) after 15 min of stimulation, and total cellular proteins were measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Equal loading of 10-μg aliquots of total protein from each sample was performed for Western blotting (Nupage Bis-Tris gel systems, Invitrogen) as described previously (42Zhu W. Kim J. Cheng C.

The phosphorylation of intracellular Smad1/5/8 and MAPK components Erk1/2 and p38 was detected by using the appropriate primary antibodies followed by secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG. Subsequently, the blots of phosphorylated Smads and MAPKs were stripped in 0.1 m glycine solution (pH 2.0) and re-probed for the detection of respective total protein kinase. Bound antibodies were visualized with ECL reagents and exposure of premium autoradiography film (Denville, Metuchen, NJ). The intensity of immunoreactive bands was quantified by gel image analysis software (ImageJ_1.32J, NIH). Determination of Osteogenic Differentiation—Osteogenic differentiation of cells was evaluated by the synthesis of bone matrix proteins found in mature osteoblasts during matrix deposition and mineralization and the expression of several key transcription factors that regulate the expression of bone-specific genes. The amount of osteocalcin (OCN) was detected in cell supernatants by a commercially available ELISA kit (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA). The activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was determined in cell lysates by colorimetric assay (Sigma) and normalized to total cellular protein (Pierce) as described previously (42Zhu W. Kim J.

Real time PCR was also performed to quantify the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osterix (Osx), which are two “master” regulators of the BMP2-osteogenic pathway (46Komori T.

All relative expression of target genes was calculated based on ΔCT values and normalized to GAPDH as described above. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated two to three times independently, with three to six samples included in each treatment group. Measurements in each experiment were run in triplicate. Results were reported as the mean ± S.D. Differences among treatment groups were compared by analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test, with values of p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. SDF-1 and CXCR4 Expression during BMP2-induced Osteogenic Differentiation—As a first step toward evaluating a potential role of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells, we analyzed the expression of both genes by quantitative real time PCR (Fig. 1). We found that stimulation with BMP2 for 4 days at 100 ng/ml reduced the expression of CXCR4 (Fig. 1A) and SDF-1 (Fig. 1B) by 19 and 33%, respectively, when compared with base-line levels in control cells stimulated with medium only. Furthermore, CXCR4 expression was reduced 35% by BMP2 stimulation at 300 ng/ml and 49% by BMP2 stimulation at 500 and 1000 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). Similarly, SDF-1 gene expression was reduced by 78% upon stimulation with BMP2 at 300 ng/ml and 75 and 90% by BMP2 stimulation at 500 and 1000 ng/ml, respectively, in comparison to control cells (Fig. 1B). When we analyzed the time course of SDF-1 protein released from C2C12 cells after stimulation with 300 ng/ml BMP2, we observed a time-dependent decrease in SDF-1 protein levels (Fig. 1C). Although stimulation with BMP2 for 1 day did not significantly alter the level of SDF-1 protein when compared with control cells, SDF-1 synthesis declined 59% upon BMP2 stimulation for 4 days and continuously decreased to 88 and 94% at 7 and 10 days of BMP2 stimulation, respectively (Fig. 1C). Role of SDF-1 Expression in BMP2-induced OCN Synthesis in C2C12 Cells—To evaluate whether SDF-1 is required for BMP-induced osteogenic differentiation, we tested how inhibition of SDF-1 expression by siRNA affects synthesis of OCN, a well established marker for osteoblast differentiation. OCN synthesis was strongly increased in C2C12 cells in response to BMP2 stimulation (Fig. 2A). However, pretreatment of cells with SDF-1 siRNA for 2 days led to a 57% lower OCN protein concentration when compared with cells treated with BMP2, whereas the addition of non-targeting control siRNA did not significantly affect OCN synthesis (Fig. 2A). The inhibitory effect of SDF-1 siRNA was largely reversed by the addition of an excess of rSDF-1 (300 ng/ml), which produced an OCN level comparable with that in cells stimulated with BMP2 alone (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the addition of SDF-1 before BMP2 stimulation further enhanced BMP2-induction of OCN synthesis by 33% (Fig. 2A). The 59% reduction of SDF-1 mRNA expression in cells after 1 day of treatment with SDF-1 siRNA compared with cells treated with control siRNA was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR (Fig. 2B). After 2 days of incubation with SDF-1 siRNA versus control siRNA, the level of SDF-1 protein was reduced by 50% (Fig. 2C). There were no significant differences in SDF-1 levels between cells treated with control siRNA and medium only (Fig. 2, B and C). GPCR Inhibition Abrogates BMP2-induced OCN Synthesis in C2C12 Cells—SDF-1 is a ligand for the GPCR CXCR4 (22Kortesidis A. Zannettino A. Isenmann S. Shi S. Lapidot T. Gronthos S.

https://openalex.org/W2070655255,"In a subset of gliomas, the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling pathway is perturbed. This is usually an early event occurring in low-grade tumors. In high-grade gliomas, the subsequent loss of the INK4a-ARF locus is one of the most common mutations. Here, we dissected the separate roles of Ink4a and Arf in PDGFB-induced oligodendroglioma development in mice. We found that there were differential functions of the two tumor suppressor genes. In tumors induced from astrocytes, both Ink4a-loss and Arf-loss caused a significantly increased incidence compared to wild-type mice. In tumors induced from glial progenitor cells there was a slight increase in tumor incidence in Ink4a-/- mice and Ink4a-Arf-/- mice compared to wild-type mice. In both progenitor cells and astrocytes, Arf-loss caused a pronounced increase in tumor malignancy compared to Ink4a-loss. Hence, Ink4a-loss contributed to tumor initiation from astrocytes and Arf-loss caused tumor progression from both glial progenitor cells and astrocytes. Results from in vitro studies on primary brain cell cultures suggested that the PDGFB-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway via extracellular signal-regulated kinase was involved in the initiation of low-grade oligodendrogliomas and that the additional loss of Arf may contribute to tumor progression through increased levels of cyclin D1 and a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent activation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase causing a strong proliferative response of tumor cells."

These ligases are composed of one of six mammalian cullin homologs (Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, Cul4a, Cul4b, and Cul5), the Ring finger containing protein Roc1/Rbx1, and cullin homolog-specific adaptor and substrate recognition subunits. To be active, cullin-based ligases require the covalent modification of a conserved lysine residue in the cullin protein with the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8. We show in this study that in intact cells Cul1 neddylation is dependent on binding to adaptor proteins and substrate recognition subunits. Mutant Cul1 that is unable to recruit adaptor and substrate recognition subunits exhibits markedly reduced neddylation, and inhibiting binding of adaptor and substrate recognition subunits to wild type Cul1 reduces Nedd8 modification. This regulatory mechanism also extends to other cullin-based E3 ligases, including Cul2, Cul3, and Cul4a. The regulation of cullin neddylation by adaptor proteins and substrate recognition subunits in cells was found to be independent of both CAND1 and the COP9 signalosome, two negative regulators of cullin Nedd8 modification. Using hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a substrate of the Elongin B/C-Cul2-VHL ligase, we demonstrate the critical role of substrate binding to promote Cul2 neddylation in a manner that does not require substrate ubiquitination but may involve a conformational change.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). They are RING domain-containing ligases that function by binding the substrate through a protein-protein interaction domain and the E2 enzyme through the RING motif, thus bringing substrate and E2 enzyme into close proximity and facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues in the substrate. Cullin-based E3 ligases are composed of several subunits, consisting of one of six mammalian cullin homologs (Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, Cul4a, Cul4b, and Cul5) that binds to the RING domain protein Roc1/Rbx1 via its C terminus. The cullin N terminus mediates binding of cullin homolog-specific substrate recognition subunits. Binding of the substrate recognition subunits requires specific adaptor proteins that bridge the interaction with the cullin homologs (except in the case of Cul3). For instance, Cul1 is known to bind substrate recognition subunits containing a conserved F-box via the adaptor protein Skp1, thus forming SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) E3 ligases, whereas Cul2 and Cul5 recruit substrate recognition subunits with a VHL or SOCS box, respectively, via the adaptor proteins Elongin B and C. In contrast, Cul3 is known to bind directly to substrate recognition subunits via their BTB domain (also known as POZ domain). All of the substrate recognition subunits also contain specific protein-protein interaction domains that are responsible for substrate recruitment, often in a manner that is dependent on post-translational modifications of the substrate, such as phosphorylation. All cullin-based E3 ligases appear to have in common a number of regulatory mechanisms (1Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). For instance, all cullin-based E3 ligases are covalently modified at a conserved lysine residue at the cullin C terminus with the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8. Cullin neddylation is required for cullin E3 ligase activity in vivo and is likely to play a role in recruiting E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to the ligase complex and stimulating multiubiquitin chain assembly (2Kawakami T.

Roc1, the RING domain-containing protein responsible for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of cullin-based ligases, is also required for the neddylation of cullins (7Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q.

CAND1 binding to cullin proteins disrupts their interaction with adaptor and substrate recognition subunits, thus inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. In addition, the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a complex composed of eight subunits with similarity to the 26 S proteasome lid subcomplex (12Wolf D.A. Zhou C. Wee S. Nat.

Given the requirement of cullin neddylation for the E3 ligase activity in vivo, it is important to identify the mechanisms through which Nedd8 modification of cullins is regulated. It has been shown that the substrates of the SCFβ-TrCP E3 ligase, IκBα and β-catenin, associate preferentially with neddylated Cul1 and play a role in promoting the modification of Cul1 with Nedd8 (2Kawakami T.

Palombella V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2326-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has been presented for a similar mechanism regulating the neddylation of Cul2 in the Elongin B/C-Cul2-VHL (ECV) E3 ligase complex (18Sufan R.I. Ohh M. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study reported that binding of the adaptor and substrate recognition subunits Skp1 and Skp2 and of the SCF-Skp2 substrate p27Kip1 to Cul1 promotes its neddylation in cell extracts (19Bornstein G. Ganoth D. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11515-11520Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This effect was found to be mediated through Skp1- and Skp2-induced dissociation of CAND1 from Cul1 and substrate-dependent prevention of the action of CSN to deneddylate Cul1 (19Bornstein G. Ganoth D. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11515-11520Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this report, we extend these studies and show that disrupting the interaction between cullin proteins and their adaptor and substrate recognition subunits in cells reduces neddylation. This dependence on complete E3 ligase assembly for efficient cullin neddylation is a general mechanism that is observed in various cullin-based E3 ligases and appears to be independent of both CAND1 and CSN. Using hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a substrate of the ECV E3 ligase, we demonstrate the critical role of substrate binding to promote Cul2 neddylation and provide evidence that this mechanism does not require substrate ubiquitination but is likely to involve a conformational change in the E3 ligase upon binding of the substrate. This is likely to constitute an important regulatory mechanism of cullin-based E3 ligase activity. Plasmid Constructs and Mutagenesis—Skp2 (NM_005983), VHL (NM_000551), and Ubc12 (NM_003969) were cloned from HEK293 cDNA, and human Keap1, murine Cul1 and human Cul2, Cul3, Cul4a, and Cul5 amplified from cDNA Image clones were purchased from Geneservice Ltd. (Image identifiers 3163902, 2812400, 4104375, 6168545, 3537176, and 30331132, respectively) and inserted into modified pcDNA3.1/Zeo including N-terminal HA-, V5-, or 2×FLAG epitope tags (Skp2, VHL, and Keap1) or into pcDNA3 including C-terminal HA-, V5-, or 2×FLAG tags (Ubc12 and Cullin constructs). The dominant-negative cullin constructs dnCul1-V5 (amino acids 1–452), dnCul2-V5 (amino acids 1–421), dnCul3-V5 (amino acids 1–427), dnCul4a-V5 (amino acids 1–439), and dnCul5-V5 (amino acids 1–437) were made using the same approach. The C-terminally 2×FLAG-tagged HIF-1α expression construct was as previously described (20Hagen T. Taylor C.T. Lam F. Moncada S. Science. 2003; 302: 1975-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The FLAG-CAT-HIF(546–626)HA fusion construct was generated by PCR amplification of the β-catenin transactivation domain (amino acids 688–781) and the HIF-1α C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain (CODD; amino acids 546–626), including a C-terminal HA tag (AYPYDVPDYA). These fragments were inserted into modified pcDNA3.1 with an N-terminal 2×FLAG tag, as shown in Fig. 8A, including a KpnI site between the β-catenin transactivation domain and CODD and a SacII site between the CODD and the HA tag. The T-Rex system (Invitrogen) was used to generate cell lines with tetracycline-inducible expression of dnUbc12-HA (21Chew E.H. Poobalasingam T. Hawkey C.J. Hagen T. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), dnCul1-V5, dnCul2-V5, and HIF-1α-FLAG according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutagenesis was carried out using the Stratagene site-directed mutagenesis kit. siRNA-mediated Gene Silencing—The following annealed Silencer Predesigned siRNA duplexes (Ambion) were used at a final concentration of 50 nm: CAND1: siRNA ID 140585 (CAND1 siRNA1), 27093 (CAND1 siRNA2); CSN5: 214069; negative controls: silencer negative control siRNA 2 and 3 or Mdm2 siRNA 122297. siRNA transfections were carried out using DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were lysed 3 days after siRNA transfections for Western blot analysis. Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer, as previously described (22Culbert A.A. Brown M.J. Frame S.M. Hagen T. Cross D.A.E. Bax B. Reith A.D. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Lysates were precleared by centrifugation before use for Western blotting. Equal amounts of protein were loaded for Western blot analysis. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-Cul1 (71–8700; Zymed Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal anti-Cul2 (51–1800; Zymed Laboratories), goat polyclonal anti-CAND1 (A-13) (sc-10672; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-p27 (610241; BD Biosciences), goat polyclonal anti-Skp2 (N-19) (sc1567; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-CSN5 (ab12323; Abcam Ltd.), monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G8140–04; U.S. Biological), monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (236–10501; Molecular Probes), monoclonal anti HIF-1α (610959; BD Biosciences), monoclonal anti-V5 (Serotec), monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), and rat monoclonal anti-HA (clone 3F10) (Roche Applied Science). All of the Western blots shown are representative of three independent experiments. Immunoprecipitation—10 μl of Anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) or 2.5 μg of V5 antibody, coupled to 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), was used for immunoprecipitations. 500 μl of precleared lysate from HEK293 cells transfected in 60-mm tissue culture plates was added. The samples were tumbled at 4 °C for 2 h, and the agarose or Sepharose beads were then washed four times in 1 ml of cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.6 m NaCl, and 1 mm EGTA and once in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then denatured in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. All of the immunoprecipitation experiments shown are representative of three independent experiments. Mutant Cullin Proteins That Are Unable to Bind to Adaptor and Substrate Recognition Subunits Exhibit Markedly Reduced Nedd8 Modification—To characterize the role of substrate recognition subunits and substrates in regulating cullin neddylation, we initially generated Cul1 and Cul3 mutants that based on previous reports are unable to bind to Skp1 and F-box Proteins or BTB domain proteins, respectively. Lack of binding of mutant Cul1 Y42A/M43A/E44A (Cul1(YME)) to endogenous and transfected F-box protein Skp2 (Fig. 1, A and B) and of mutant Cul3 S53A/F54A/E55A (Cul3(SFE)) to the BTB domain protein Keap1 (Fig. 1C) was confirmed by cotransfection of corresponding expression constructs in HEK293 cells, followed by immunoprecipitation. Skp2 and Keap1 coimmunoprecipitated with wild type but not mutant Cul1 or Cul3, respectively (Fig. 1, A–C). As shown in Fig. 1D, Cul1(YME) and Cul3(SFE), which were unable to bind to their adaptor proteins and substrate recognition subunits, showed only very little Nedd8 modification compared with the wild type proteins, as was apparent by the much lower abundance of the slower migrating band in mutant Cul1 and Cul3. We confirmed that the slower migrating band indeed corresponded to the Nedd8-modified form by coexpressing a dominant-negative version of the Nedd8-conjugating enzyme Ubc12 (C111S) (23Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17008-17015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which led to marked reduction of the low mobility band (Fig. 1E). It can be argued that the primary defect of Cul1(YME) and Cul3(SFE) is the inhibition of Cul1 or Cul3 neddylation and that the absence of binding to Skp2 and Keap1 is a consequence rather than the cause of reduced Nedd8 modification. To rule out this possibility, we examined binding of Skp2 and Keap1 to Cul1 and Cul3, respectively, in a cell line that was stably transfected with dnUbc12 under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (21Chew E.H. Poobalasingam T. Hawkey C.J. Hagen T. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Induction of dnUbc12 with tetracycline leads to inhibition of neddylation of cullin proteins, inhibition of their E3 ligase activity, and consequently accumulation of cullin-based E3 ligase substrates, for instance p27Kip1, as shown in Fig. 2 (A and B). Inhibition of cullin neddylation had no effect on binding of Skp2 to Cul1 and of Keap1 to Cul3 (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, mutation of the Cul1 neddylation site Lys720 to Arg prevented Nedd8 modification but did not affect the interaction between Cul1 and Skp2 (Fig. 2C), confirming that cullin neddylation does not regulate binding of substrate recognition subunits. Inhibiting Adaptor and Substrate Recognition Subunit Binding to Wild Type Cullin Proteins Reduces Neddylation—The results in Fig. 1 suggest that Cul1 and Cul3 are only neddylated to a significant degree if they are incorporated into intact E3 ligase complexes. To confirm this hypothesis, we overexpressed dominant-negative versions of different cullin proteins together with the respective full-length protein. The dominant-negative cullin proteins are comprised of the cullin N terminus. They lack the Roc1-binding and neddylation sites but are able to bind to adaptor proteins and substrate recognition subunits through their N termini, thus competing with full-length cullins for incorporation into E3 ligase complexes. As shown in Fig. 3A, expression of dominant-negative Cul1, Cul3, and Cul4a reduced the neddylation of the respective full-length cullin Proteins, and this effect correlated positively with the expression level of the dominant-negative compared with the full-length protein. The expression level of transiently transfected dominant-negative Cul2 was low. We therefore generated a HEK293 cell line with stable expression of dnCul2-V5 under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Although there was significant basal expression of dnCul2-V5 in the absence of tetracycline, the addition of tetracyline to the cells induced a marked increase in dnCul2-V5 abundance (Fig. 3B). As expected, induction of dnCul2-V5 resulted in the accumulation of HIF-1α, a substrate of the Cul2-based E3 ligase, but had no effect on α-tubulin expression. The increase in dnCul2-V5 expression upon tetracycline addition was accompanied by a clear reduction in the ratio of neddylated to unneddylated transfected full-length Cul2-V5 (Fig. 3B). A similar reduction in the ratio of Nedd8-modified to unmodified Cul2 was also observed for the endogenous protein upon induction of dnCul2 with tetracycline (Fig. 3C). An attempt to perform a similar analysis for Cul5 was technically not possible because the expression of dnCul5-V5 was very low, even in stably transfected clones with tetracycline-inducible expression. To determine whether endogenous Cul1 is subject to the same regulatory mechanism, a stably transfected HEK293 cell line with tetracycline-inducible expression of dnCul1-V5 was generated (Fig. 3D). There also was significant basal expression of dnCul1-V5 in the absence of tetracycline; however, the addition of tetracyline to the cells for 24 h induced a marked increase in dnCul1-V5 abundance. As expected, this led to the accumulation of the SCFSkp2 substrate p27Kip1, confirming that the dominant-negative, ubiquitination-deficient version of Cul1 can effectively compete with endogenous Cul1 for binding to adaptor, substrate recognition subunits and substrate. As shown in Fig. 3D, dnCul1-V5 induction inhibited neddylation of endogenous Cul1 almost completely. The Stimulation of Cullin Neddylation by Adapter and Substrate Recognition Subunits Is Not Mediated by CAND1 or CSN—CAND1 and CSN are two important negative regulators of cullin neddylation. CAND1 interacts specifically with unneddylated cullins and binding of CAND1 to Cul1 prevents access to the site of Nedd8 modification (11Goldenberg S.J. Cascio T.C. Shumway S.D. Garbutt K.C. Liu J. Xiong Y. Zheng N. Cell. 2004; 119: 517-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CSN mediates cullin deneddylation via the metallopeptidase activity of the CSN5 subunit. We therefore considered the possibility that the decreased neddylation of cullin proteins that are not bound to adaptor proteins and substrate recognition subunits is dependent on CAND1 or CSN. To this end, we first examined the binding of CAND1 to the various cullin homologs. V5-tagged cullin homologs were immunoprecipitated from lysates of transfected cells and immunoprecipitates analyzed for coprecipitating CAND1. The results in Fig. 4A show that although all cullin proteins were expressed at similar levels, as apparent from their similar abundance in the V5 immunoprecipitates, only Cul1 bound CAND1 to a significant degree. This result is consistent with previous reports that show that not all cullin proteins interact with CAND1 (9Liu J. Furukawa M. Matsumoto T. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1511-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 24Oshikawa K. Matsumoto M. Yada M. Kamura T. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although Cul2, Cul3, and Cul4a did not interact with CAND1 in the coimmunoprecipitation assay, binding of adaptor and substrate recognition subunits regulated their neddylation status. We then examined whether the reduced neddylation of the Cul1(YME) mutant that is unable to recruit adaptor and substrate recognition subunits is due to increased CAND1 binding. However, we found that Cul1(YME) showed markedly reduced interaction with CAND1 compared with wild type Cul1 (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that decreased neddylation of binding-deficient cullins is not due to increased association with CAND1. Finally, siRNA-mediated silencing of CAND1 did not increase the neddylation of endogenous Cul1 (Fig. 4C), suggesting that CAND1 does not normally inhibit neddylation by preventing binding of adaptor and substrate recognition subunits to Cul1. To examine the role of CSN, we used siRNA-mediated silencing of the CSN5 subunit. We had previously observed that CSN5 knockdown in HEK293 cells led to only a small increase in wild type Cul1 neddylation (21Chew E.H. Poobalasingam T. Hawkey C.J. Hagen T. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4D, silencing of CSN5 did not lead to an increase in Nedd8 modification of the Cul1 and Cul3 mutants that are deficient in binding to adaptor and substrate recognition subunits, indicating that the reduced Nedd8 modification of these mutants is not mediated through CSN-dependent deneddylation. Requirement of Substrate Binding for Stimulation of Cullin Neddylation—To determine whether binding of substrates is required for the stimulation of cullin neddylation by adaptor and substrate recognition subunits, we used deletion constructs of Skp2 and Keap1, which lack the substrate-binding sites but are still able to interact with Cul1 and Cul3, respectively. A C-terminal deletion mutant of Skp2 that lacks the last 175 amino acids, including the last five leucine-rich domains of the substrate-binding site, and is thus unable to recruit substrates (25Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 26Hao B. Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Wu G. Miller J.J. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 7: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar) was found to associate almost exclusively with unneddylated Cul1 (Fig. 5). In contrast, wild type Skp2 immunoprecipitated both neddylated and unneddylated Cul1. These results therefore suggest that association of Skp2 with neddylated Cul1 requires substrate binding. The ratio of Nedd8-modified to unmodified Cul1 that was associated with Skp2 was slightly higher compared with the ratio of the two forms in cell lysate, suggesting that Skp2 binding promotes neddylation of Cul1, presumably by recruiting substrate into the E3 ligase complex. We then examined neddylation of Cul3 associated with wild type Keap1 and a deletion of Keap1, which lacks the substrate-recruiting double glycine or Kelch repeat (DGR) domain (comprising amino acids 315–598) as well as a short C-terminal region (amino acids 599–624). In contrast to Skp2, wild type Keap1 did not preferentially associate with neddylated Cul3 and the Keap1 mutant deficient in substrate binding immunoprecipitated neddylated and unneddylated Cul3 at the same ratio compared with wild type Keap1 (Fig. 6A). The total amount of Cul3 that coimmunoprecipitated with Keap1(ΔDGR) was greater compared with wild type Keap1, which is likely due to a higher expression level of V5-Keap1(ΔDGR) (Fig. 6A, bottom panel). As shown in Fig. 6B, we confirmed that in contrast to wild type V5-Keap1, V5-Keap1(ΔDGR) is indeed deficient in binding the transcription factor NRF2, the best characterized substrate of Keap1. We thus concluded that the recruitment of substrate into the Keap1-Cul3 ligase complex does not stimulate Cul3 neddylation. The VHL tumor suppressor protein, which serves as the substrate recognition subunit of the Cul2-based E3 ligase ECV, has been reported to promote Cul2 neddylation (27Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36025-36029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Liakopoulos D. Büsgen T. Brychzy A. Jentsch S. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5510-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we observed that VHL preferentially associates with neddylated Cul2-FLAG (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, Sufan and Ohh (18Sufan R.I. Ohh M. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported that a mutant of VHL that lacks the substrate-binding domain associates exclusively with unneddylated Cul2, demonstrating that substrate binding is required for association of VHL with Nedd8-modified Cul2. Moreover, these authors showed that HIF-1α, the best characterized substrate of the ECV E3 ligase that is recruited through the VHL substrate recognition subunit, associates preferentially with neddylated Cul2 (18Sufan R.I. Ohh M. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We wished to confirm this result using a cell line with tetracycline-inducible expression of full-length wild type HIF-1α, carrying a C-terminal FLAG tag. As shown in Fig. 7B, significant expression of the HIF-1α-FLAG protein can only be observed in the presence of tetracycline and after incubation of cells under hypoxic conditions. Incubation of cells at low oxygen tension prevents the degradation of the HIF-1α protein by the ECV E3 ligase by inhibiting oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of Pro402 and Pro564 in HIF-1α, which normally targets the protein to VHL. In the experiment shown in Fig. 7C, cells were treated with tetracycline (to induce HIF-1α-FLAG expression) and proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (to prevent HIF-1α-FLAG degradation) under normoxic conditions, followed by immunoprecipitation"
https://openalex.org/W1973582073,"The FK506 binding protein FKBP52 belongs to the large family of immunophilins and is known as a steroid receptor-associated protein. Previous data suggest that FKBP52 is associated with the motor protein dynein and with the cytoskeleton during mitosis. Here we demonstrate a specific and direct interaction between FKBP52 and tubulin. The region of FKBP52 located between aa 267 and 400, which includes the tetratricopeptide repeat domain, is required for tubulin binding. We provide evidence that FKBP52 prevents tubulin polymerization and that an 84 residue sequence located in the C-terminal part of the molecule (aa 375-458) is necessary and sufficient for its microtubule depolymerization activity. In colocalization experiments in PC12 cells, FKBP52 is associated with tubulin in motile cellular compartments. Furthermore, we suggest that, by using siRNA, a decrease of FKBP52 expression in PC12 cells may lead to differentiated cell phenotype characterized by neurite extensions. Collectively, our data define an unexpected property of FKBP52 as a novel regulator of microtubule dynamics. The possible role of microtubule formation and tubulin binding of other immunophilins such as FKBP12 and FKBP51 is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2024953482,"AKT activity has been reported in the epidermis associated with keratinocyte survival and differentiation. We show in developing skin that Akt activity associates first with post-proliferative, para-basal keratinocytes and later with terminally differentiated keratinocytes that are forming the fetal stratum corneum. In adult epidermis the dominant Akt activity is in these highly differentiated granular keratinocytes, involved in stratum corneum assembly. Stratum corneum is crucial for protective barrier activity, and its formation involves complex and poorly understood processes such as nuclear dissolution, keratin filament aggregation, and assembly of a multiprotein cell cornified envelope. A key protein in these processes is filaggrin. We show that one target of Akt in granular keratinocytes is HspB1 (heat shock protein 27). Loss of epidermal HspB1 caused hyperkeratinization and misprocessing of filaggrin. Akt-mediated HspB1 phosphorylation promotes a transient interaction with filaggrin and intracellular redistribution of HspB1. This is the first demonstration of a specific interaction between HspB1 and a stratum corneum protein and indicates that HspB1 has chaperone activity during stratum corneum formation. This work demonstrates a new role for Akt in epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W2092769210,"Neutrophils are thought to affect pulmonary carcinogenesis by promoting the metabolism of inhaled chemical carcinogens, causing enhanced formation of promutagenic DNA adducts. We hypothesized that neutrophils interfere with the removal of such DNA adducts by inhibiting nucleotide excision repair (NER) in target cells. Human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were cocultured with activated neutrophils, and we observed a significant reduction of NER in the A549 cells, which was abrogated by addition of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide. The inhibitory effect of neutrophils could be mimicked by the MPO product hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which caused an acute, dose-dependent inhibition of NER in A549 cells. This was independent of cytotoxicity or ATP loss and persisted up to 24 h. These data were supported by showing that HOCl caused a delayed removal of DNA adducts in benzo[a]pyrene-diolepoxide-exposed A549 cells. The acute HOCl-induced inhibition of NER can only partly be explained by oxidative modification of repair proteins. To explain the more persistent effects of HOCl, we analyzed the expression of NER genes and found that HOCl significantly reduced XPC expression. In conclusion, these data indicate that neutrophils are potent inhibitors of nucleotide excision repair. This may provide a further biological explanation for the association between inflammation and lung cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2040765860,"Astroglial cells are essential components of the neurogenic niches within the central nervous system. Emerging evidence suggests that they are among the key regulators of postnatal neurogenesis. Although astrocytes have been demonstrated to possess the potential to instruct stem cells to adopt a neuronal fate, little is known about the nature of the glia-derived instructive signals. Here we propose that all-trans retinoic acid, one of the most powerful morphogenic molecules regulating neuronal cell fate commitment, may be one of the glia-derived factors directing astroglia-induced neurogenesis. According to data obtained from several complementary approaches, we show that cultured astrocytes express the key enzyme mRNAs of retinoic acid biosynthesis and actively produce all-trans retinoic acid. We show that blockage of retinoic acid signaling by the pan-RAR antagonist AGN193109 prevents glia-induced neuron formation by noncommitted stem cells. Therefore, we provide strong in vitro evidence for retinoic acid action in astroglia-induced neuronal differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2031823482,"Epigenetic alterations and the resulting inactivation of tumor suppressor genes often contribute to the development of various cancers. To identify novel candidates that may be silenced by aberrant methylation in esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC), we analysed ESCC cell lines by a recently developed method known as bacterial artificial chromosome array-based methylated CpG island amplification (BAMCA), and selected candidates through BAMCA-assisted strategy. In the course of this program, we identified frequent CpG methylation-dependent silencing of the gene encoding cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 (CRABP1) in our panel of ESCC cell lines. Expression of CRABP1 mRNA was restored in gene-silenced ESCC cells after treatment with 5-aza 2′-deoxycytidine. The DNA methylation status of the CRABP1 CpG island with clear promoter activity correlated inversely with expression of this gene. CpG methylation of CRABP1 was frequently observed in primary ESCC tissues as well. Restoration of CRABP1 expression in ESCC cells lacking the protein reduced cell growth by inducing arrest at G0–G1, whereas knockdown of the gene in cells expressing CRABP1 promoted cell growth. Among 113 primary ESCC tumors, the absence of immunoreactive CRABP1 was significantly associated with de-differentiation of cancer cells and with distant lymph-node metastases in the patients. These results indicate that CRABP1 appears to have a tumor-suppressor function in esophageal epithelium, and its epigenetic silencing may play a pivotal role during esophageal carcinogenesis. Its expression status in biopsies or resected tumors might serve as an index for identifying ESCC patients for whom combined therapeutic modalities would be recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2156016336,"Although neuronal functions depend on their robust polarity, the mechanisms that ensure generation and maintenance of only a single axon remain poorly understood. Using highly sensitive two-dimensional electrophoresis-based proteomics, we identified here a novel protein, single axon-related (singar)1/KIAA0871/RPIPx/RUFY3, which contains a RUN domain and is predominantly expressed in the brain. Singar1 expression became up-regulated during polarization of cultured hippocampal neurons and remained at high levels thereafter. Singar1 was diffusely localized in hippocampal neurons and moderately accumulated in growth cones of minor processes and axons. Overexpression of singar1 did not affect normal neuronal polarization but suppressed the formation of surplus axons induced by excess levels of shootin1, a recently identified protein located upstream of phosphoinositide-3-kinase and involved in neuronal polarization. Conversely, reduction of the expression of singar1 and its splicing variant singar2 by RNA interference led to an increase in the population of neurons bearing surplus axons, in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase-dependent manner. Overexpression of singar2 did not suppress the formation of surplus axons induced by shootin1.

These cells first form several minor processes, any of which appears capable of becoming either an axon or a dendrite, during the first 12-24 h after plating (stage 2). One of the neurites then rapidly elongates to acquire axonal characteristics (stage 3), whereas the others later become dendrites (stage 4). Hippocampal neurons must use a robust internal mechanism that ensures polarization as they regenerate a single axon and multiple dendrites even when polarity is altered by axonal amputation (4Dotti C.G. Banker G.A. Nature. 1987; 330: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 5Goslin K. Banker G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).

As downstream events, these pathways are thought to regulate cytoskeletal networks of actin filaments (21Bradke F. Dotti C.G. Science. 1999; 283: 1931-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and microtubules (20Watabe-Uchida M. John K.A. Janas J.A. Newey S.E. Van Aelst L.

In contrast to the progress in defining the mechanisms of axon specification, our knowledge of how neurons generate and maintain only a single axon is limited. Reduction in the expression or activities of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, PTEN, or microtubule affinity-regulation kinase (MARK)2 in hippocampal neurons leads to formation of multiple axons (11Jiang H. Guo W. Liang X. Rao Y. Cell. 2005; 120: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 12Yoshimura T. Kawano Y. Arimura N. Kawabata S. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K.

S. A. 2006; 103: 8534-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), suggesting that these molecules may be involved in inhibiting the formation of surplus axons. Recently, we identified the protein shootin1, which is located upstream of PI 3-kinase and involved in neuronal polarization (24Toriyama M. Shimada T. Kim K.B. Mitsuba M. Nomura E. Katsuta K. Sakumura Y. Roepstorff P. Inagaki N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). During polarization, shootin1 accumulated in a single neurite while being depleted in its sibling neurites, through competitive transport to multiple neurites. This in turn induced formation of a single axon, leading us to propose that the depletion of shootin1 from the sibling neurites of the nascent axon by competition prevents the formation of surplus axons (24Toriyama M. Shimada T. Kim K.B. Mitsuba M. Nomura E. Katsuta K. Sakumura Y. Roepstorff P. Inagaki N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We describe here a novel brain-specific protein, named single axon-related (singar)1. Singar1 became up-regulated during polarization of cultured hippocampal neurons and remained at high levels thereafter. Reduction of singar1 expression by RNAi led to an increase in the population of neurons bearing surplus axons, as has been reported for glycogen synthase kinase-3β, PTEN, and MARK2. Furthermore, overexpression of singar1 suppressed the formation of surplus axons induced by excess amounts of shootin1, without affecting normal polarization processes. These data suggest that singar1 suppresses the formation of surplus axons, thereby contributing to the robustness of neuronal polarity. Cultures and Metabolic Labeling—Hippocampal neurons prepared from E18 rat embryos were seeded on coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) and laminin (Iwaki) and cultured in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B-27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 1 mm glutamine without glia feeder layer as described (14Inagaki N. Chihara K. Arimura N. Menager C. Kawano Y. Matsuo N. Nishimura T. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 781-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). For quantitative two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), stage 2 and stage 3 neurons were metabolically labeled with the culture medium containing 13% of the normal levels of methionine and cysteine plus Pro-mix l-[35S] in vitro cell labeling mix (containing ∼70% l-[35S]methionine and ∼30% l-[35S]cysteine, 80 μCi/ml; GE Healthcare) for 4 h. To prepare this labeling medium, we used custom-made Neurobasal medium without methionine and cysteine (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Highly Sensitive 2-DE and Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—2-DE was performed as reported previously (25Oguri T. Takahata I. Katsuta K. Nomura E. Hidaka M. Inagaki N. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), using a composite gel series comprising a total 93 × 103-cm combined gel system (26Inagaki N. Katsuta K. Curr. Proteomics. 2004; 1: 35-39Crossref Google Scholar). For differential 2-DE, neurons were metabolically labeled as above, and protein spots separated by 2-DE gels were visualized by autoradiography. For protein identification, unlabeled protein samples from 2-week-old rat brains were separated by the 2-DE gel and visualized by silver staining. The protein spots corresponding to the radio-labeled ones were then excised from gels and in-gel-digested as described (27Nomura E. Katsuta K. Ueda T. Toriyama M. Mori T. Inagaki N. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 39: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) was performed using a Voyager™ Elite equipped with delayed extraction (Applied Biosystems). Data base searches were conducted using the Mascot program (Matrix Science) and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases. Cloning of Singar—Full-length cDNAs of rat singar1 and singar2 were amplified by PCR from a rat brain cDNA library obtained from P8 Wistar rat using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with the primers 5′-GCGGATCCATGTCTGCCCTGACGCCTCCGAC-3′ and 5′-GCGGATCCCTAATGATGTTTTGGGATCAGTTTATTTG-3′. The cDNAs were then subcloned into the BamHI site of pCMV (Stratagene) -Myc, pCMV-FLAG, pCAGGS-Myc with a β-actin promoter (provided by J. Miyazaki, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) (28Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar), and pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) vectors. These plasmids were designed to generate the proteins fused to Myc, FLAG, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags at the N terminus. We did not use epitope tag repeats. Protein and Antibody Preparation—Recombinant full-length singar1 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)codonPlus (Stratagene) as a GST fusion protein by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C for 4 h and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), after which GST was removed from singar1 by PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). Rabbit polyclonal anti-singar antibody was raised against the recombinant singar1 and affinity-purified before use. Immunocytochemistry, Immunoblot, and Microscopy—Immunocytochemistry and immunoblot were performed as described (14Inagaki N. Chihara K. Arimura N. Menager C. Kawano Y. Matsuo N. Nishimura T. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 781-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, anti-Myc (monoclonal: M047-3, MBL, Nagoya, Japan), tau-1 (MAB3420, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), anti-synaptophysin (SY38, Progen, Heidelberg, Germany), and anti-MAP-2 (HM-2, Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies were used at 1:7,000, 1:500, 1:2,500, and 1:1,000 dilution, respectively. Anti-singar antibody was used at 0.2 μg/ml. For 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) staining, neurons were incubated with CMFDA (1:500) for 30 min before fixation. Fluorescent images of neurons were acquired using a fluorescent microscope, Axioplan2 (Carl Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Plan-NEOFLUAR ×40, 0.75 NA or ×20, 0.50 NA objective, an AxioCamMRm CCD camera (Carl Zeiss), and Axiovision3 imaging software (Carl Zeiss). Line-scan analysis (1 pixel wide) was performed using MetaMorph imaging system (Universal imaging company, Downingtown, PA). Each plotted point represents a 0.32-μm average of immunoreactivity along the lines. For immunoblot, anti-Myc (polyclonal:562, MBL, Nagoya, Japan), anti-FLAG (M2: F3165, Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-βIII-tubulin (TUJ-1, MMS-435P, Covance, Berkeley, CA) antibodies were used at 1:1,000, 1:5,000, and 1:2,000 dilution, respectively. Anti-singar antibody was used at 0.1 μg/ml. Transfection and RNAi—Neurons were transfected with cDNA or RNA by the calcium phosphate method (14Inagaki N. Chihara K. Arimura N. Menager C. Kawano Y. Matsuo N. Nishimura T. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 781-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), Nucleofector (Amaxa), or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) before or after plating. Namely, for immunoblot analysis of the effects of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on singar expression, transfection of neurons was carried out before plating using Nucleofector. For analysis of the effects of siRNA on neuronal morphology after polarization, neurons were transfected by the calcium phosphate method on day in vitro (DIV) 3. For the other analysis, neurons were transfected with DNA or RNA using Lipofectamine 2000 before plating. Namely, neurons suspended in Neurobasal medium containing 10% fetal calf serum were incubated with lipofectamine2000/DNA (or RNA) complex for 1.5 h. Then, they were washed by centrifugation and resuspending in Neurobasal/10% fetal calf serum and plated on coverslips. Three h after the plating, the medium was replaced by the culture medium. HEK293T cells were transfected with cDNA by the calcium phosphate method. The siRNA sequence 5′-GGCAAAAGUAGAUGCGUUA-3′ targeting rat singar1 and singar2 corresponds to nucleotides 846-864 in the coding region of singar1 (nucleotides 900-918 in the coding region of singar2). The scramble RNA (scRNA) 5′-AGCGAAGGUUGACGCUCUU-3′ encodes the same amino acid sequence as the siRNA but lacks significant sequence similarity to any gene. The RNAs were obtained from Dharmacon. Immunoprecipitation—HEK293T cells were transfected with the expression plasmids and grown in 60-mm diameter culture dishes. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and harvested in the cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the extracts were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant were incubated with 1.5 μg of anti-FLAG antibodies, and immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose 4B. After three times of washing with the cell lysis buffer, the beads were boiled in the SDS sample buffer and applied to immunoblot analysis. Materials—Calyculin A, λ-phosphatase, CMFDA, rhodamine phalloidin, and LY294002 were obtained from WAKO (Osaka, Japan), New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK), Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), Molecular Probes, and Calbiochem, respectively. cDNA encoding Myr-PI 3-K p110 was from Upstate Biotechnology. cDNA encoding p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was amplified by PCR from a rat brain cDNA library obtained as described above. Statistics—In the statistical analysis for Fig. 4A, the neurons with one long neurite longer than 100 μm and over twice as long as the other neurites were counted as stage 3 neurons (these cells do not include neurons with multiple axons). Significance was determined by the unpaired Student's t test. Identification of Singar1 by a Proteome Screening of Stage 2 and Stage 3 Hippocampal Neurons—To identify proteins involved in neuronal polarity formation, we previously performed proteome analysis of cultured rat hippocampal neurons using a 93 × 103-cm large gel 2-DE (26Inagaki N. Katsuta K. Curr. Proteomics. 2004; 1: 35-39Crossref Google Scholar). We screened about 6,200 protein spots on 2-DE gels and detected 277 that were consistently up-regulated during the transition between stages 2 and 3 (24Toriyama M. Shimada T. Kim K.B. Mitsuba M. Nomura E. Katsuta K. Sakumura Y. Roepstorff P. Inagaki N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry of one of them, located at a molecular mass of 55 kDa and pI = 5.2 in gels (Fig. 1A), identified six peptides whose sequences corresponded to human (BC051716), rat (EF577045), and mouse (BC049127) cDNA sequences of KIAA0871/RUFY3/Rap2-interacting protein X (RPIPx) in genome databases (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1). Rat, human, and mouse KIAA0871/RUFY3/RPIPx encode proteins of 469 amino acids and predicted molecular masses of 52.9, 52.9, and 53.0 kDa, respectively. Domain searching revealed that KIAA0871/RUFY3/RPIPx contains one RUN (RPIP8, UNC-14, and NESCA) domain (29Callebaut I. de Gunzburg J. Goud B. Mornon J.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 79-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and two coiled-coil domains (Fig. 1C). Recently, the crystal structure of its RUN domain was reported (30Kukimoto-Niino M. Takagi T. Akasaka R. Murayama K. Uchikubo-Kamo T. Terada T. Inoue M. Watanabe S. Tanaka A. Hayashizaki Y. Kigawa T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31843-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We designated it singar1, together with Dr. Osamu Ohara (Kazusa DNA Research Institute), who initially reported its full cDNA sequence as KIAA0871 (AB020678) and Dr. Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute). It shows homology to RUN domain-containing proteins, such as RPIP8, RPIP9, RUFY1/Rabip4, RUFY2, UNC-14, and NESCA (Fig. 1D). Data base searches also identified Pan troglodytes, Macaca mulatta, Bos taurus, Canis familiari, and Gallus gallus orthologs of singar1, and partial open reading frames in Xenopus laevis, Danio rerio, Fugu rubripes, and Drosophila. In addition, a splicing variant of 487 amino acids was identified in rat (EF538802) and mouse (BC058259) cDNAs and termed singar2 (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1). Singar1 and Singar2 Are Predominantly Expressed in the Brain and Up-regulated during Polarization—We raised an antibody against recombinant singar1 to investigate its tissue and intracellular distribution. The antibody recognized three bands at 55, 60, and ∼56 kDa in immunoblots of rat brain (Fig. 2A). The lower band corresponds to the apparent Mr of recombinant singar1, whereas the upper band corresponds to that of recombinant singar2 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the two splicing variants are expressed in the brain. Treatment of brain lysate with λ-phosphatase led to disappearance of the middle 56-kDa band and increase in the intensity of the lower band (Fig. 2C), whereas treatment of HEK293T cells expressing exogenous singar1 with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A increased the intensity of the middle band (Fig. 2D). Therefore, we concluded that the middle band corresponds to the phosphorylated form of singar1. The three bands were not detected in various peripheral tissues (Fig. 2A), suggesting that singar1 and singar2 are predominantly expressed in the brain. Consistent with the 2-DE data for the metabolically labeled protein (Fig. 1A), the level of singar1 expression increased remarkably during the transition from stage 2 to stage 3 in cultured hippocampal neurons and remained high until DIV28 (Fig. 2E). Consistently, expression of singar1 in rat brain was relatively low on embryonic day 15 (E15), peaked around postnatal day 4 (P4), and decreased in the adult brain (Fig. 2F). Similar expression patterns were observed for singar2 and phosphorylated singar1 in general, except that the expression of singar2 in hippocampal neurons returned to a low level at DIV14 and up-regulation of phosphorylated singar1 was relatively slow in the cultured neurons and brain (Fig. 2, E and F). Singar1 and Singar2 Accumulates in Growth Cones of Minor Processes and Axons—Next, we examined the localization of singar in cultured hippocampal neurons. Immunocytochemical analysis showed a diffuse staining of endogenous singar in stage 2, stage 3, and stage 4 neurons (Fig. 3, A-C). In stage 2, singar immunoreactivity showed a moderate accumulation in growth cones of minor processes (arrowheads); 52% of growth cones showed accumulation (n = 120 growth cones). In stage 3, singar accumulated in growth cones of axons in addition to those of minor processes (Fig. 3B, arrows and arrowheads); 77% of axonal growth cones showed accumulation (n = 56 growth cones), whereas 52% of minor process growth cones showed accumulation (n = 83 growth cones). In stage 4, singar accumulated in growth cones of axons (Fig. 3C); 31% of axonal growth cones showed accumulation (n = 55 growth cones). Singar immunoreactivity was also localized in dendrites but did not show accumulation there (Fig. 3C). We used a green volume marker, CMFDA, as an internal standard to measure relative concentration of singar (singar immunoreactivity/CMFDA staining) (24Toriyama M. Shimada T. Kim K.B. Mitsuba M. Nomura E. Katsuta K. Sakumura Y. Roepstorff P. Inagaki N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The relative concentrations of singar in growth cones of minor processes and axons were 2.3 ± 0.2 times (n = 15 growth cones) and 2.9 ± 0.2 times (n = 15 growth cones) higher than that in cell bodies, respectively (Fig. 3B). In growth cones, singar immunoreactivity was preferentially localized in F-actin-enriched filopodia and lamel-lipodia (Fig. 3D). As the anti-singar antibody recognized both singar1 and singar2, we also examined the localization of Myc-tagged singar1 and singar2 (Myc-singar1 and Myc-singar2) exogenously expressed in hippocampal neurons. Localizations of Myc-singar1 and Myc-singar2 were essentially similar to that of the endogenous singar immunoreactivity (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). Overexpression of Singar1 Suppresses the Formation of Surplus Axons Induced by Excess Levels of Shootin1, without Affecting Normal Polarization Processes—To analyze the functions of singar1 and singar2 in neuronal polarization, we overexpressed Myc-tagged singar1 and singar2 in hippocampal neurons under the β-actin promoter. Neurons were transfected with cDNAs before plating, and the percentage of polarized neurons was counted at 62 h in culture. Fifty-three ± 7.8% of neurons overexpressing Myc-singar1 (n = three independent cultures, 239 neurons examined) and 58 ± 5.6% of neurons overexpressing Myc-singar2 (n = three independent cultures, 289 neurons examined) polarized, as in the case of control neurons with overexpressed Myc-GST (56 ± 5.8%, n = three independent cultures, 216 neurons examined) (Fig. 4A). Axons of similar lengths were formed from neurons with overexpressed Myc-singar1, Myc-singar2, and Myc-GST (Fig. 4A). We further cultured the neurons with overexpressed Myc-singar1, Myc-singar2, and Myc-GST until DIV6. We did not find differences in either the length or the number of axons and dendrites among these neurons (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, we conclude that overexpression of singar1 or singar2 does not affect normal polarization processes. Recently, we identified the protein shootin1, which is located at an upstream position in polarity signals involving PI 3-kinase (24Toriyama M. Shimada T. Kim K.B. Mitsuba M. Nomura E. Katsuta K. Sakumura Y. Roepstorff P. Inagaki N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Overexpression of shootin1 in hippocampal neurons leads to formation of surplus axons. Surprisingly, co-transfection of singar1 led to a reduction in the percentage of neurons with surplus axons induced by shootin1 overexpression (n = four independent cultures, 493 neurons examined; p < 0.01, when compared with control neurons overexpressing Myc-GST) (Fig. 4, D and E). On the other hand, overexpression of singar2 did not suppress the formation of surplus axons induced by shootin1 (n = four independent cultures, 455 neurons examined). Immunoblot analysis showed that overexpression of singar1 did not suppress the expression of shootin1 (Fig. 4F), thereby ruling out the possibility that the reduction in the percentage of neurons with surplus axons is caused by a decrease in the level of overexpressed shootin1. Reduction of Singar Expression by RNAi Leads to an Increase in the Population of Neurons Bearing Surplus Axons—To further analyze the roles of singar in neuronal polarization, we reduced singar expression using an siRNA. Transfection of hippocampal neurons with an siRNA directed against singar before plating resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of endogenous singar1 and singar2 when compared with those seen after transfection with the corresponding scRNA (Fig. 5A). Suppression of singar in hippocampal neurons by the siRNA was also confirmed immunocytochemically (Fig. 5B, arrowheads). Transfection of neurons with the siRNA led to a 67% reduction in singar immunoreactivity when compared with the level seen after transfection with the scRNA (28 neurons examined). Remarkably, 15 ± 2.1% (n = three independent cultures, 150 neurons examined; p < 0.01, when compared with scRNA) of the neurons bore more than one (two or three) axons that were immunostained by axon-specific markers tau-1 (Fig. 5C) and anti-synaptophysin (Fig. 5D) antibodies but were immunonegative for a dendrite-specific marker anti-MAP2 antibody (Fig. 5E), on DIV6 (Fig. 6A).

https://openalex.org/W2154004234,"Lipocalin-type prostaglandin (PG) D synthase (L-PGDS) is expressed in adipocytes and is proposed to be involved in the regulation of glucose tolerance and atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes, because L-PGDS gene knock-out mice show abnormalities in these functions. However, the role of L-PGDS and the regulation mechanism governing its gene expression in adipocytes remain unclear. Here, we applied small interference RNA of L-PGDS to mouse 3T3-L1 cells and found that it suppressed differentiation of these cells into adipocytes. Reporter analysis of the mouse L-PGDS promoter demonstrated that a responsive element for liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) at -233 plays a critical role in preadipocytic 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, we identified two sterol regulatory elements (SREs) at -194 to be cis-elements for activation of L-PGDS gene expression in adipocytic 3T3-L1 cells. L-PGDS mRNA was induced in response to synthetic liver X receptor agonist, T0901317, through activation of the expression of SRE-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in the adipocytic 3T3-L1 cells. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that LRH-1 and SREBP-1c bound to their respective binding elements in the promoter of L-PGDS gene. Small interference RNA-mediated suppression of LRH-1 or SREBP-1c decreased L-PGDS gene expression in preadipocytic or adipocytic 3T3-L1 cells, respectively. These results indicate that L-PGDS gene expression is activated by LRH-1 in preadipocytes and by SREBP-1c in adipocytes. Liver X receptor-mediated up-regulation of L-PGDS through activation of SREBP-1c is a novel path-way to enhance adipocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2029821960,"The leukocyte mono-Ig-like receptor (LMIR) belongs to a new family of paired immunoreceptors. In this study, we analyzed activating receptor LMIR4/CLM-5 as a counterpart of inhibitory receptor LMIR3/CLM-1. LMIR4 is expressed in myeloid cells, including granulocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, whereas LMIR3 is more broadly expressed. The association of LMIR4 with Fc receptor-gamma among immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-bearing molecules was indispensable for LMIR4-mediated functions of bone marrow-derived mast cells, but dispensable for its surface expression. Cross-linking of LMIR4 led to Lyn- and Syk-dependent activation of bone marrow-derived mast cells, resulting in cytokine production and degranulation, whereas that of LMIR3 did not. The triggering of LMIR4 and TLR4 synergistically caused robust cytokine production in accordance with enhanced activation of ERK, whereas the co-ligation of LMIR4 and LMIR3 dramatically abrogated cytokine production. Notably, intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide strikingly up-regulated LMIR3 and down-regulated LMIR4, whereas that of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor up-regulated both LMIR3 and LMIR4 in granulocytes. Cross-linking of LMIR4 in bone marrow granulocytes also resulted in their activation, which was enhanced by lipopolysaccharide. Collectively, these results suggest that the innate immune system is at least in part regulated by the qualitative and quantitative balance of the paired receptors LMIR3 and LMIR4."
https://openalex.org/W2076466518,"Transcription of the ITGB3 gene, which encodes β3 integrin, increases during myeloid differentiation. αvβ3 integrin mediates adhesion to fibronectin or vitronectin and regulates various aspects of the inflammatory response in mature phagocytes. In these studies, we found that the homeodomain transcription factor HoxA10 interacted with a specific ITGB3 cis element and activated transcription of this gene during myeloid differentiation. We also found that increased fibronectin adhesion in differentiating myeloid cells was dependent upon this HoxA10-induced increase in β3 integrin expression. We determined that activation of ITGB3 transcription required a HoxA10 domain that was not identical to the “hexapeptide” that mediates interaction of Hox and Pbx proteins. This activation domain was also not identical to a previously identified HoxA10 repression domain that mediates interaction with transcriptional co-repressors. Instead, this HoxA10 activation domain had homology to “PQ” protein-protein interaction domains that have been described previously in other transcription factors. Consistent with this, we found that the HoxA10 PQ-like domain recruited the CREB-binding protein (CBP) to the ITGB3 promoter. This was associated with an increase in local histone acetylation in vivo. In immature myeloid cells, we previously determined that HoxA10 repressed transcription of the CYBB and NCF2 genes, which encode the phagocyte oxidase proteins gp91PHOX and p67PHOX, respectively. Therefore, our studies indicated that HoxA10 either activates or represses gene transcription at various points during myelopoiesis. Our studies also suggested that HoxA10 is a bifunctional protein that is involved in dynamic regulation of multiple aspects of phagocyte phenotype and function. Transcription of the ITGB3 gene, which encodes β3 integrin, increases during myeloid differentiation. αvβ3 integrin mediates adhesion to fibronectin or vitronectin and regulates various aspects of the inflammatory response in mature phagocytes.

Our studies also suggested that HoxA10 is a bifunctional protein that is involved in dynamic regulation of multiple aspects of phagocyte phenotype and function. β3 integrin, which is encoded by the ITGB3 gene, is expressed in a variety of cell types. ITGB3 transcription occurs in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) 2The abbreviations used are: HSC, hematopoietic stem cells; IFN, interferon; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; M-CSF, macrophage-CSF; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; aa, amino acid; IL, interleukin. and in various blood cell lineages (1Wall C.D.

In cells of the myeloid lineage, β3 integrin participates in αvβ3 heterodimers that mediate cell adhesion to fibronectin and vitronectin (2Klingemann H.G. Dedhar S. Blood. 1989; 74: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hill H.R. Augustine N.H. Williams P.A. Brown E.J. Bohnsack J.F. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibronectin is a component of the bone marrow extracellular matrix, and fibronectin binding promotes survival of HSC and differentiating myeloid progenitor cells (4Verfaille C.M. McCarthy J.B. McGlave P.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 5Bhatia R. Williams A.D. Munthe H.A. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 324-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Expression of β3 integrin increases during differentiation of neutrophils and monocytes (1Wall C.D. Conley P.B. Armendariz-Borunda J. Sudarshan C. Wagner J.E. Raghow R. Jennings L.K. Blood Cells, Molecules, and Diseases. 1997; 23: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In mature monocytes, αvβ3 mediates phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, thereby contributing to down-regulation of the inflammatory response (6Savill J. Dransfield I. Hogg N. Haslett C. Nature. 1990; 343: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 7Fadok V.A. Savill J.S. Haslett C. Bratton D.L. Doherty D.I. Campbell P.A. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar). In neutrophils, αvβ3 provides a “braking” mechanism during transmigration from the vascular space and is also involved in activation of the phagocyte-specific respiratory burst oxidase (8Bruyninckx W.J. Comerford K.M. Lawrence D.W. Colgan S.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 3251-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Yan S.R. Novak M.J. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 195: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition to participation in the innate immune response, αvβ3-ligand binding activates Syk protein-tyrosine kinase and may thereby be involved in generation of cell survival signals in phagocytic cells (8Bruyninckx W.J. Comerford K.M. Lawrence D.W. Colgan S.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 3251-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results suggest that understanding the mechanisms that regulate αvβ3 expression would be relevant to understanding phagocytic cell function and survival. However, regulation of ITGB3 transcription during myelopoiesis or in mature myeloid cells has not been studied. Indeed, the only previous studies of the ITGB3 promoter were performed in epithelial carcinoma cells (10Daftary G.S. Troy P.J. Bagot C.N. Young S.L. Taylor H.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These studies identified a region of the ITGB3 promoter that interacts in vitro with the homeodomain transcription factor HoxA10. In these studies, overexpressed HoxA10 activated an artificial promoter construct with this region of the ITGB3 promoter in transfection experiments with a breast cancer cell line (10Daftary G.S. Troy P.J. Bagot C.N. Young S.L. Taylor H.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because HoxA10 is expressed in differentiating myeloid cells, the first hypothesis of our current studies was that HoxA10 regulates ITGB3 transcription during myelopoiesis. The HOX genes are arranged in four paralog groups (A–D) on four different chromosomes in mouse and man. During embryogenesis, HOX gene transcription occurs 3′ to 5′ through each paralog group with the more 3′ genes expressed in cephalad and the more 5′ genes in caudal organs (11Acampora D. D'Esposito M. Faiella A. Pannese M. Migliaccio E. Morelli F. Stornaiuolo A. Nitro V. Simeone A. Boncinelli A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10385-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). HOX genes are also sequentially expressed during definitive hematopoiesis with the 3′-most genes being expressed in HSCs and 5′-most genes in more differentiated hematopoietic cells (12Sauvageau G. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Hogge D.E. Dragowska W.H. Reid D.S. Largman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12223-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, ABD HOXA genes (HoxA7–11) are maximally expressed in committed myeloid progenitors. Abnormal expression of various Hox proteins is associated with acute myeloid leukemia, implying that tight regulation of the Abd HoxA proteins is important for normal myelopoiesis (13Kawagoe H. Humphries R.K. Blair A. Sutherland H.J. Hogge D.E. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1999; 13: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Additionally, our previous studies indicated that Abd HoxA proteins are involved in regulating transcription of genes involved in phagocyte-specific functional activities (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, the second hypothesis of these studies was that dynamic regulation of ITGB3 transcription by HoxA10 contributes to phagocyte function and survival during myelopoiesis. In our previous studies, we found that HoxA10 dynamically regulates transcription of the genes encoding the phagocyte oxidase proteins gp91PHOX and p67PHOX (the CYBB and NCF2 genes, respectively) (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These genes are expressed in myeloid cells after the promyelocyte stage of differentiation and are actively transcribed until cell death (16Newburger P.E. Ezekowitz R.A. Whitney C. Wright J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5215-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Leto T.L. Lomax K.J. Volpp B.D. Nunio H. Sechler J.M.G. Nauseef W.M. Clark R. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Science. 1990; 248: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We determined that HoxA10 represses CYBB and NCF2 transcription in undifferentiated myeloid cells. In these cells, HoxA10 binds to homologous CYBB and NCF2 cis elements as a heterodimer with the homeodomain protein Pbx1 (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hox and Pbx proteins are frequent DNA-binding partners, and transcriptional regulation by some such heterodimers is mediated by Pbx interaction with transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors (18Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, we found that HoxA10-repression of CYBB and NCF2 transcription was Pbx-independent and involved direct interaction of HoxA10 with the corepressor histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) (15Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Lu Y. Goldenberg I. Bei L. Andrejic J. Eklund A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47792-47802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This interaction required a unique HoxA10 domain, not conserved in other Abd HoxA proteins (19Lu Y. Goldenberg I. Bei L. Andrejic J. Eklund A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47792-47802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As differentiation proceeds, HoxA10 binding to the CYBB and NCF2 genes decreases, relieving repression (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because gp91PHOX and p67PHOX are the rate-limiting phagocyte oxidase components, this results in differentiation stage-specific acquisition of respiratory burst competence in mature phagocytes. If HoxA10 also regulates ITGB3 transcription in a differentiation stage-specific manner, this would further suggest that HoxA10 is an important regulator of phagocyte function. Target genes that are activated by HoxA10 in myeloid cells have been not been previously identified. However, based on previous studies, HoxA10 would be anticipated to activate ITGB3 transcription during myelopoiesis. Therefore, the first goal of these studies was to determine whether HoxA10 increases β3 integrin expression and ITGB3-transcription in differentiating myeloid cells. The second goal of these studies was to determine the functional relevance of Hox10 regulation of β3 integrin expression for differentiation-induced phagocytic adhesion. The third goal of these studies was to determine whether HoxA10 activation of ITGB3 transcription requires a Pbx partner. If transcriptional activation is not Pbx-dependent, ITGB3 transcription will be used as a model to identify a HoxA10 activation domain. Therefore, these studies address mechanisms regulating phagocyte function and also fundamental mechanisms of HoxA10 transcription factor activity. Artificial Promoter Constructs—Artificial promoter/reporter constructs were generated as described previously (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (obtained from Dr. A. Kraft, Hollings Cancer Center at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston). Constructs were generated with four copies (in the forward direction) of the –1973 to –1933 bp sequence from the ITGB3 promoter (p-B3ITATACAT) (10Daftary G.S. Troy P.J. Bagot C.N. Young S.L. Taylor H.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Garcia-Villa M. Li L. Riely G. Bray P.F. Blood. 1994; 83: 668-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA Sequences and Mutagenesis—The cDNA for human HoxA10 was obtained from C. Largman (University of California, San Francisco) (22Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. Le Beau M.M. Deaven L. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3443-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This cDNA sequence represents the major transcript in mammalian hematopoietic cells, encoding a 393-amino acid, 55-kDa protein (22Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. Le Beau M.M. Deaven L. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3443-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Wild type HoxA10 cDNA sequence was subcloned into the pSRα vector for expression in mammalian cells (23Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisajwa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type HoxA10 was also subcloned into the pM2 vector, for expression in mammalian cells as a fusion protein with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4, as described previously (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HoxA10 5′ truncation mutant cDNAs were generated by PCR, using primers that incorporate the genuine HoxA10 Kozak consensus sequence and an ATG. Truncation mutants were generated that included HoxA10 amino acids (aa) 1–219, 1–179, 1–112, 102–146, 124–146, and 145–219. These sequences were subcloned into the PM2 vector for expression as a fusion protein with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor. HoxA10 truncations were also generated representing amino acids 219–403, 146–403, and 60–403. These sequences were subcloned into the pSRα vector for expression in mammalian cells. HoxA10 cDNAs with mutation of the Pbx1 interaction domain were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, by a previously described technique (19Lu Y. Goldenberg I. Bei L. Andrejic J. Eklund A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47792-47802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The wild type HoxA10 was mutated to change amino acid 312 from asparagine to alanine and amino acid 313 from tryptophan to threonine (N312A/W323T HoxA10). This mutant cDNA was subcloned into a pSRα vector for expression in U937 transfection experiments. All mutant cDNA sequences generated by PCR were completely sequenced on both strands to verify that no unintended mutations had been introduced. Plasmids for shRNA Expression—Plasmids were generated to express shRNA to human β3 integrin or HoxA10 using the pLKO.1 vector (kindly provided by Dr. K. Rundell, Northwestern University, Chicago). Oligonucleotide sequences for β3 integrin-specific shRNA, HoxA10-specific shRNA, or scrambled control shRNAs were designed with the assistance of the software on the Promega web site (Promega, Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Core Facility of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University. Double-stranded, synthetic oligonucleotides were generated representing the –1973 to –1933 bp sequence of the ITGB3 promoter (5′-GGGGGGCTTATAATGTTATTTTTAGTTTACAGGTTCTTAC-3′) or the –94 to –134 bp sequence of the CYBB promoter, 5′-TTCAGTTGACCAATGATTATTAGCCAATTTTCTGATAAAA-3′. In these oligonucleotides, the HoxA10 core is in boldface type; the Pbx core is in italic type, and the ccaat boxes are underlined. In some experiments, an irrelevant control sequence from the NF1 promoter was also used. The human myelomonocytic cell line U937 (24Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Andrew Kraft (Hollings Cancer Center at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston). Cells were maintained and differentiated as described (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

U937 cells were treated with 500 units per ml of human recombinant IFNγ for 24 or 48 h, as indicated (Hoffmann-La Roche). Bone marrow was harvested from HoxA10+/– mice or wild type litter mates, and myeloid progenitor cells were cultured in GM-CSF (20 ng/ml), IL3 (10 ng/ml), and stem cell factor (10 ng/ml) for 48 h. These cells were differentiated ex vivo in M-CSF (20 ng/ml) for 72 h. Animal experiments were performed according to a protocol approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee. Nuclear extract proteins were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 11: 1475-1479Crossref Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), with protease inhibitors as described previously (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides probes were prepared; EMSA and antibody supershift assays were performed, as described (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Antiserum to HoxA10 (not cross-reactive with other Hox proteins) was obtained from Covance Research Products (Richmond, CA) and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to Pbx1 and Pbx2 (noncross-reactive with each other or other Pbx proteins) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All EMSA were performed several times with at least two different batches of nuclear proteins, and representative data are shown. Reporter Gene Assays—Cells were transfected by electroporation as described (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

U937 cells (32 × 106 per sample) were transfected as follows: with 70 μg of p-TATACAT or p-B3ITATACAT; 50 μg of pSRα, HoxA10/pSRα (N312A/W313T), HoxA10/pSRα, 219–403-aa HoxA10/pSRα, 146–403-aa HoxA10/pSRα, 60–403-aa HoxA10/pSRα; and 15 μg of p-CMVβ-gal (to normalize for transfection efficiency). In some experiments, cells were also co-transfected with a vector to express the E1a viral oncoprotein (26Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectants were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, with and without IFNγ (500 units/ml). Preparation of cell extracts, β-galactosidase, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were performed as described (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

In other experiments, cells were transfected with 30 μg of p-(GAL4)5TKCAT and 60 μg of a vector to expression HoxA10 or various mutants as fusion proteins with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor. In some experiments, cells were also co-transfected with a vector to express the E1a viral oncoprotein. The amount of GAL4 fusion protein expression vector used in these experiments was determined in preliminary studies in which the various HoxA10 expression plasmids were titrated to determine, for each construct, the amount of plasmid for maximal repression activity (10, 30, 60, and 120 μg). For all constructs, maximal repression activity was obtained with 60 μg of expression vector, consistent with our previous investigations with this assay (19Lu Y. Goldenberg I. Bei L. Andrejic J. Eklund A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47792-47802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Stable Transfectants—Stable U937 transfectants were generated with a vector to overexpress HoxA10 or empty vector control. Stable transfectants were selected in G418 or puromycin as described previously (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). At least three transfectant pools were tested for each construct. In some experiments, U937 cells were co-transfected with vectors to express shRNA for β3 integrin or scrambled shRNA control. Western Blots—Total cell lysate proteins from U937 cells or various U937 stable transfectants (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were serially probed with antibodies to various proteins. Antibody to β3 integrin was obtained from Chemicon-Millipore (Billericon, MA). Antibodies to tubulin, HoxA10, Syk, and phospho-Syk were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Each experiment was performed at least three times, and representative blots are shown. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—In other experiments, lysate proteins (1.5 mg) from U937 transfectants with 124–146 aa of HoxA10-Gal4 or Gal4-DBD vector control were immunoprecipitated with anti-GAL4 DNA-binding domain antibody (rabbit polyclonal from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or irrelevant control antibody (rabbit anti-mouse IgG from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blots and sequentially probed with antibodies to CBP or the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). This experiment was repeated twice, and representative blots are shown. RNA was isolated from U937 cells using the TRIzol reagent, according to manufacture's instructions (Invitrogen). RNA was tested by denaturing gel electrophoresis to determine the integrity of the 18 S and 28 S ribosomal bands. cDNA was generated using standard techniques. Primers were designed with the software from Integrated DNA Technologies, and real time PCR was performed using SYBR green according to the “standard curve” method. Result were normalized to 18 S and actin to control for RNA abundance in various samples. In other experiments, real time PCR was performed on chromatin that co-immunoprecipitated from U937 cells with an antibody to HoxA10, the CREB-binding protein (CBP), pCAF, p300, acetyl-histone 2A, or irrelevant control. Co-precipitating chromatin was amplified with PCR primers flanking the HoxA10-binding cis element in the ITGB3 promoter. Un-precipitated chromatin was a control to normalize for DNA abundance in the various samples. Tissue culture dishes were coated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml fibronectin. U937 cells were incubated with or without IFNγ for 48 h, counted, and transferred to fibronectin pre-coated tissue culture dishes. Cells were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with 20 μg/ml of antibody to β1 integrin, β3 integrin, or irrelevant control antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) prior to plating on fibronectin. The dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and adherent cells were fixed for 40 min in 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature. Fixed cells were stained for 40 min at room temperature with 0.1% crystal violet and solubilized in 10% acetic acid, and absorbance at 540 nm was determined as a measure of adhesion (27Seales E.C. Shaikh F.M. Woodard-Grice A.V. Aggarwal P. McBrayer A.C. Hennessy M. Bellis S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37610-37615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In other studies, murine bone marrow-derived, ex vivo differentiated monocytes were assayed for fibronectin adhesion. For these studies, nonadherent cells were transferred to fibronectin-coated dishes and assayed for adhesion as above. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test and analysis of variance methods using the Sigmaplot and Sigmastat software. β3 Integrin Expression and β3 Integrin-dependent Fibronectin Adhesion Increased during IFNγ-induced Differentiation of U937 Myeloid Cells—The goal of these studies was to determine whether HoxA10 regulates ITGB3 promoter activity, β3 integrin expression, and phagocyte adhesion in differentiating myeloid cells. Therefore, we performed initial experiments to determine whether the U937 myelomonocytic cell line was a good model for these studies. U937 cells are a myeloid leukemia line that undergoes monocytic differentiation upon treatment with various cytokines, including IFNγ (24Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IFNγ differentiation of U937 cells results in acquisition of functional characteristics of mature phagocytes over 48–72 h. These functional characteristics include respiratory burst activity, phagocytosis, and cell adhesion. In previous studies, we determined that HoxA10 protein is abundantly expressed in U937 cells and that expression is not altered by IFNγ differentiation (14Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Lu Y. Goldenberg I. Bei L. Andrejic J. Eklund A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47792-47802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, this cell line represents a reasonable model to study these events of late myeloid differentiation. We initially determined the impact of IFNγ differentiation on β3 integrin expression. In Western blots of U937 lysate proteins, we found that abundance of β3 integrin protein increased during the 72 h of IFNγ-induced differentiation (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this increase in β3 integrin protein correlated with an increase in mRNA abundance, we determined the impact of IFNγ treatment on β3 integrin mRNA expression by real time PCR. For these studies, mRNA abundance of the respiratory burst oxidase components gp91PHOX and p67PHOX were positive controls for differentiation, and message abundance was normalized to actin and 18 S. Consistent with the protein expression data, we found that IFNγ treatment increased β3 integrin mRNA in U937 cells (Fig. 1B). These studies indicated a statistically significant increase in β3 integrin, gp91PHOX, and p67PHOX mRNA during differentiation (p < 0.01, n = 9 for all three messages). However, these studies did not indicate a functional significance to increased β3 integrin expression during myeloid differentiation. Therefore, we investigated the role of β3 integrin in fibronectin adhesion of differentiating U937 cells. We chose to study this interaction because fibronectin is an extracellular matrix component involved in enhancing survival of hematopoietic cells (5Bhatia R. Williams A.D. Munthe H.A. Exp.

Subsequently, the testicular sperm moves out of the testis into a long storage tube, the epididymis. Sperm continue differentiation (maturation) as they move along the epididymis. The extent of sperm plasma membrane modification increases as the sperm pass distinct stages of the epididymis, the caput (head), corpus (body), and cauda (tail). Sperm are named according to how far they have progressed along the epididymis and thus are termed caput sperm, corpus sperm, or cauda sperm (see Fig. 1). Many sperm plasma membrane proteins undergo post-translational modification, including proteolytic processing, and have multiple protein-protein interactions during membrane trafficking in the complicated process for differentiation and maturation of the sperm. The ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteases) compose a gene family distributed in a variety of tissues (4Schlöndorff J. Blobel C.P. J.

Thus, mouse sperm enter the oviduct using a mechanism that is ADAM1a/ADAM2-dependent. During direct sperm-egg interactions in the oviduct, one step is sperm binding to the egg's extracellular matrix, termed the egg zona pellucida (ZP). Adam3-null sperm are incapable of binding to the ZP (17Shamsadin R. Adham I.M. Nayernia K. Heinlein U.A.O. Oberwinkler H. Engel W. Biol.

However, previous studies have not clarified the relationship of ADAM3 with ADAM1a and/or ADAM2, which could affect the function(s) of ADAM3 (12Nishimura H. Kim E. Nakanishi T. Baba T. J. Biol.

Peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) was from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Ipswich, MA), and endoglycosidase H (Endo H) from Roche Applied Science. Antibodies—Rabbit anti-ADAM2 polyclonal antibody and mouse monoclonal antibodies against ADAM2 (9D2) and ADAM3 (7C1) were provided by Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody and anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody were obtained from Pharmingen and Sigma, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit IgG and mouse IgG were products of Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antisera against calmegin and calnexin (11Ikawa M. Nakanishi T. Yamada S. Wada I. Kominami K. Tanaka H. Nozaki M. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Dev.

Affinity-purified mouse polyclonal antibody against PH-20 was produced in our laboratory (18Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate ADAM3, rabbit polyclonal antibody against an ADAM3-derived peptide was prepared by Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA). A3Cys, a 16-mer peptide corresponding to the sequence from His581 to Asp596 in the Cys-rich domain of mouse ADAM3, was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The conjugate was used to immunize 3–9-month-old New Zealand rabbits once with complete Freund's adjuvant and three subsequent times with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Antisera were obtained after the fourth immunization, and antibody against the A3Cys peptide was affinity-purified from the antisera using A3Cys-immobilized agarose beads. This affinity-purified antibody is termed “anti-A3Cys antibody.” Animals—Adam2-/- (16Cho C. Bunch D.O. Faure J.-E. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Primakoff P. Myles D.G.

Immunoblotting—Proteins in samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were probed with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by the detection of immunoreactive signals using a SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce). The signal intensities in Fig. 1 were densitometrically quantified using ImageJ software (available at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). TGCs—Testes were taken from 12–16-week-old ICR mice (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA), Adam2-/- mice, and Adam3-/- mice. On a 52% Percoll gradient, testicular sperm were separated from testicular cells, which comprise a fraction enriched for TGCs (21Phelps B.M. Koppel D.E. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Caput, Corpus, and Cauda Epididymal Sperm—The caput and corpus epididymes were taken from ICR and Adam2-/- mice, minced thoroughly by scissors in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air to release sperm into PBS. After filtration of the sperm suspensions using nylon mesh sheets, the sperm cells were washed three times with PBS by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Cauda epididymal sperm of ICR, Adam2-/-, and Adam3-/- mice were highly purified using OptiPrep according to the method of Claassens et al. (22Claassens O.E. Menkveld R. Harrison K.L. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 3139-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cell Lysates—Cells were suspended in PBS and 1% n-octyl β-d-pyranoglucoside and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation of the suspensions at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were used for experiments. Preparation of Cell-surface Protein Fractions—To biotinylate cell-surface proteins, TGCs (0.5 × 108 cells/ml) were incubated with 1 mm EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin for 30 min at room temperature in 2 ml of 4 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, and 2 mm MgCl2 (HBSM). The cells were washed once with HBSM and then twice with PBS by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The cell pellets were used for preparation of cell lysates or of membrane fractions. Cauda epididymal sperm were also biotinylated by the same method as used for TGCs, except that PBS was consistently used instead of HBSM. The biotinylated proteins in samples (equivalent to 1 × 108 cells) were precipitated with 50 μl of monomeric avidin-conjugated beads in 4 ml of PBS, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% n-octyl β-d-pyranoglucoside during incubation for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times with the same buffer, the beads were mixed with 200 μl of PBS, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% n-octyl β-d-pyranoglucoside, and 5 mm d-biotin (total of 250 μl) and kept for 30 min at room temperature. The biotinylated proteins were recovered in the supernatants (equivalent to 4 × 108 cells/ml) after centrifugation of the suspensions at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Separation of Membrane Fractions from TGCs—Biotinylated TGCs (2 × 108 cells) were suspended in 500 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA (TNE) containing 1% Triton X-100; kept on ice for 1 h; and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To prepare fractions of detergent-insoluble membranes (DIMs) and detergent-soluble membranes (DSMs), the supernatants were mixed with 1.5 ml of TNE, 0.33% Triton X-100, and 52% OptiPrep and overlaid with 6 ml of TNE and 30% OptiPrep and subsequently with 3.5 ml of TNE and 5% OptiPrep. After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C in an SW 41 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), 1-ml fractions were taken from the top to the bottom of the gradient (total of 12 fractions). Based on the immunoblotting of each fraction for the DIM marker protein caveolin-1 (data not shown), fractions 4 and 5 were pooled as DIMs. Fractions 9–12 were judged to correspond to DSMs from the fractionation results for ADAM2, ADAM3, calmegin, and calnexin (data not shown), pooled together, and termed as DSMs. To prepare biotinylated proteins in the DIM and DSM fractions for affinity isolation with monomeric avidin, n-octyl β-d-pyranoglucoside was added to these membrane fractions (1% final). The fractions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Biotinylated proteins in the supernatants were precipitated with monomeric avidin-conjugated beads to isolate cell-surface proteins as described above. Glycosidase Digestion—Glycosidase digestion was carried out as described previously (9Kim E. Nishimura H. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, glycoproteins in samples were denatured by boiling for 5 min in the presence of 0.4% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and digested for 12 h at 37 °C with 15,000 units/ml PNGase F in PBS, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol or with 0.2 units/ml Endo H in 200 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 0.2% SDS, and 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitation—Lysates (equivalent to 1 × 107 cells) and cell-surface protein fractions (equivalent to 1 × 108 cells) were kept on ice for 2 h with 20 μg of anti-A3Cys antibody, 20 μg of rabbit anti-ADAM2 polyclonal antibody, 10 μl of anti-calmegin antiserum, or 10 μl of anti-calnexin antiserum in 1 ml of PBS, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% n-octyl β-d-pyranoglucoside. Immune complexes that formed in the reaction mixtures were captured with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (5 μg of IgG or 1 μl of antiserum/μl of beads) during 30-min incubation at room temperature, followed by washing three times with the same buffer. ADAM3 and coprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation for 30 min at room temperature in 50 μl of the wash buffer containing 500 μg/ml A3Cys (the peptide used for immunization). The beads carrying the immune complexes of calmegin or calnexin were boiled for 5 min in 50 μl of reducing SDS sample buffer. The eluted proteins were then analyzed by immunoblotting. When proteins contained in the immune complexes of ADAM2 or calnexin were required for digestion with PNGase F and Endo H, they were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 50 μl of PBS, 0.3% SDS, and 0.75% 2-mercaptoethanol. Level of Surface ADAM3 in Adam2-null TGCs—To examine why the level of ADAM3 is so low in Adam2-null sperm, we investigated when ADAM3 first appears on the cell surface. A previous study was unable to detect ADAM2 and ADAM3 on the plasma membrane of TGCs (19Stein K.K. Go J.C. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To improve the sensitivity of cell-surface protein detection, we developed a technique using vectorial labeling of the cell-surface proteins with biotin, followed by isolation of the biotinylated proteins with monomeric avidin-conjugated beads. Whole cell lysates and cell-surface protein fractions prepared from wild-type, Adam2-/-, and Adam3-/- TGCs were analyzed by immunoblotting for several testicular proteins such as ADAM2, ADAM3, ADAM24, calmegin, calnexin, and PH-20 (Fig. 2). Densitometry of immunoreactive signals was used to quantify the amounts of specific protein in each lane. To set up the experimental conditions in Fig. 2, we used PH-20 as a positive control. Tryptic digestion of cell-surface proteins on intact TGCs revealed that PH-20 was almost completely localized on the cell surface, where it could be degraded by trypsin. 5H. Nishimura, D. G. Myles, and P. Primakoff, unpublished data. When band intensities of PH-20 were compared between “total” and “surface” fractions of wild-type mice (Fig. 2), surface fractions yielded a 9.1-fold higher signal than total fractions. If most of the cell-surface protein was recovered from monomeric avidin-conjugated beads, surface fractions (equivalent to 5 × 106 TGCs/lane) would contain an amount 10-fold greater than total fractions (equivalent to 0.5 × 106 TGCs/lane), and the relative amount of surface PH-20 would be close to 100% of the total. Because the observed amount was 91%, the recovery of TGC-surface proteins was probably almost complete. Moreover, the intracellular protein α-tubulin was not found in any surface fraction, indicating that biotin was not reacting with intracellular proteins (Fig. 2). We judged from these data that the immunoreactive signals of the tested proteins can be quantitatively compared between the total and surface fractions. As determined by densitometry, in wild-type TGCs, 12.0% of ADAM2 and 3.0% of ADAM3 were found present on the cell surface, whereas most of these two ADAM proteins were intracellular. Similarly, 7.7% of ADAM2 was localized on the surface of Adam3-null cells, and 4.7% of ADAM3 was on the Adam2-null TGC surface. These data show the presence of ADAM2 and ADAM3 on the TGC surface, albeit in low proportion of the total, and this localization was not significantly affected by targeted disruption of either Adam3 or Adam2. Other testicular proteins tested were also found in the surface protein fractions at similar levels on wild-type, Adam2-/-, and Adam3-/- cells. The plasma membrane of wild-type TGCs contained calmegin (11.0% of the total) and calnexin (10.0% of the total). These proteins have been known as endoplasmic reticulum-resident molecular chaperones, but in recent work, cell-surface calnexin has been reported in a variety of cell types (23Wiest D.L.

Proteomics. 2006; 6: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Differences between Cell-surface ADAM3 in Wild-type Versus Adam2-/- TGCs—In Fig. 2, ADAM3 was localized at normal levels on the plasma membrane of Adam2-null TGCs. Because our earlier studies showed that ADAM3 is present in Adam2-null epididymal sperm at ∼10% of wild-type levels (18Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 19Stein K.K. Go J.C. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we sought an explanation for the severe reduction of ADAM3 levels in the mutant sperm. Previously, we had found that a substantial population of ADAM3 partitioned into lipid rafts (detergent-insoluble membranes/microdomains) on sperm (18Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ADAM3 is targeted into the incorrect membrane microdomains on Adam2-null TGCs, we examined the amount of surface ADAM3 in DIMs and DSMs of wild-type and Adam2-/- TGCs. TGCs were first biotinylated, and after separation of DIMs from DSMs, the cell-surface proteins were isolated from the membrane fractions using monomeric avidin-conjugated beads. Total fractions of DIMs and DSMs contained ADAM2 and ADAM3 in wild-type TGCs (Fig. 3). The profiles for distribution of ADAM2 and ADAM3 into DIM and DSM fractions from wild-type cells were similar to the those for distribution in Adam3-/- and Adam2-/- TGCs, respectively. Even when cell-surface proteins were isolated from the total DIMs and DSMs, little difference was observed for ADAM2 between wild-type and Adam3-/- TGCs and for ADAM3 between wild-type and Adam2-/- TGCs. Other tested proteins in the Adam2-/- and Adam3-/- cells were also normally present in the total and surface fractions of DIMs and DSMs. Thus, Adam2-null TGCs are apparently indistinguishable from wild-type TGCs in localization of ADAM3 in cell-surface membrane microdomain(s). Another possibility is that ADAM3 is altered in its modifications during trafficking of ADAM3 to the cell surface in Adam2-null TGCs. We investigated by Endo H digestion of ADAM3 whether glycosylation of cell-surface ADAM3 is altered in Adam2-null TGCs. Endo H resistance of glycans on surface glycoproteins is often acquired as the glycoproteins complete their passage through the Golgi apparatus and achieve normally modified carbohydrate moieties. Endo H cleaves off high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharides and can be compared with another glycosidase, PNGase F, which splits all N-linked glycans. Cell-surface proteins in DIMs and DSMs were digested with PNGase F and Endo H. We used DIMs and DSMs to increase the resolution of this analysis, i.e. to enhance detection of non-abundant forms of tested proteins. Immunoblot analysis of the digests (Fig. 4) revealed that ADAM2 was mostly sensitive to Endo H in DIMs and DSMs of wild-type TGCs. Adam3-null TGCs exhibited essentially the same digestion profiles of ADAM2 as the wild-type cells. Cell-surface ADAM3 was also investigated after Endo H digestion. In wild-type TGCs, approximately half of ADAM3 was Endo H-resistant in DIMs, whereas this enzyme almost completely cleaved ADAM3 in DSMs. Interestingly, most of ADAM3 became Endo H-resistant in DIMs of Adam2-null TGCs. Also in DSMs of Adam2-null cells, about half of the ADAM3 protein was Endo H-resistant. Thus, ADAM3 is different in wild-type and Adam2-/- TGCs with respect to its glycosylation pattern. In both DIMs and DSMs of Adam2-null TGCs, there is more Endo H-resistant ADAM3 compared with wild-type cells. The control protein PH-20, for which trafficking is presumably independent of ADAM2 and ADAM3, was completely Endo H-resistant in any sample tested (Fig. 4).

Here we show that FAK signaling is important for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced interleukin 6 (IL-6) mRNA and protein expression in breast (4T1), lung (A549), prostate (PC-3), and neural (NB-8) tumor cells by FAK short hairpin RNA knockdown and by comparisons of FAK-null (FAK–/–) and FAK+/+ mouse embryo fibroblasts. FAK promoted TNFα-stimulated MAPK activation needed for maximal IL-6 production. FAK was not required for TNFα-mediated nuclear factor-κB or c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. TNFα-stimulated FAK catalytic activation and IL-6 production were inhibited by FAK N-terminal but not FAK C-terminal domain overexpression. Analysis of FAK–/– fibroblasts stably reconstituted with wild type or various FAK point mutants showed that FAK catalytic activity, Tyr-397 phosphorylation, and the Pro-712/713 proline-rich region of FAK were required for TNFα-stimulated MAPK activation and IL-6 production. Constitutively activated MAPK kinase-1 (MEK1) expression in FAK–/– and A549 FAK short hairpin RNA-expressing cells rescued TNFα-stimulated IL-6 production. Inhibition of Src protein-tyrosine kinase activity or mutation of Src phosphorylation sites on FAK (Tyr-861 or Tyr-925) did not affect TNFα-stimulated IL-6 expression. Moreover, analyses of Src–/–, Yes–/–, and Fyn–/– fibroblasts showed that Src expression was inhibitory to TNFα-stimulated IL-6 production. These studies provide evidence for a novel Src-independent FAK to MAPK signaling pathway regulating IL-6 expression with potential importance to inflammation and tumor progression.

J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). FAK is recruited to sites of integrin clustering via interactions of its C-terminal domain with integrin-associated proteins such as talin and paxillin. FAK contains a central kinase domain, C-terminal proline-rich regions that serve as binding sites for Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing proteins, and an N-terminal band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin homology (FERM) domain that acts to regulate FAK kinase activity through an auto-inhibitory mechanism (2Ceccarelli D.F.

Integrin clustering promotes FAK activation, results in FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 (Tyr(P)-397), promotes Src family protein-tyrosine kinase binding to the FAK Tyr(P)-397 site, and facilitates the formation of the FAK-Src signaling complex that results in the secondary phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-861 and Tyr-925 (4Schlaepfer D.D.

Acta. 2004; 1692: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The FAK-Src complex can promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of various targets linked to either growth, survival, or motility-associated signaling pathways (6Cox B.D. Natarajan M. Stettner M.R. Gladson C.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 7Mitra S.K. Schlaepfer D.D. Curr. Opin.

Canonical FAK-Src integrin signaling can be blocked by overexpression of the FAK C-terminal domain termed FRNK (1Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). FAK can also be activated by growth factor receptors, G-protein-linked, and cytokine stimulation of cells (5Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Ilic D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), but how FAK gets activated by non-integrin stimuli remains incompletely defined. FAK also participates in immune and inflammatory response signaling by regulating cytokine production (8Watanabe Y. Tamura M. Osajima A. Anai H. Kabashima N. Serino R. Nakashima Y. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). FAK is important for lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion by human and murine fibroblasts (9Zeisel M.B. Druet V.A. Sibilia J. Klein J.P. Quesniaux V. Wachsmann D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7393-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IL-6 and IL-8 expression by human synoviocytes stimulated with oral streptococci protein I/II also requires FAK (10Neff L.

However, the molecular mechanism(s) whereby FAK promotes IL-6 expression remain largely undefined. IL-6 is an important mediator of immune responses, inflammation, and tumor progression (11Hodge D.R. Hurt E.M. Farrar W.L. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 2502-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). IL-6 expression is largely regulated by gene transcription, and the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) cytokine is a potent stimulator of IL-6 expression (12MacEwan D.J. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). TNFα binds to two distinct cell surface receptors (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2, which can activate a variety of intracellular signaling cascades (12MacEwan D.J. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). TNFα can activate FAK, and this is linked to enhanced cell motility (13Corredor J. Yan F. Shen C.C. Tong W. John S.K.

TNFα-stimulated genes include IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, cycloxygenase-2, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (18Aggarwal B.B. Shishodia S. Sandur S.K. Pandey M.K. Sethi G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1605-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). FAK promotes matrix metalloproteinase-9 and VEGF mRNA expression by generating signals leading to the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), respectively (19Hsia D.A.

In addition, the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is an important mediator of TNFα signaling, and NF-κB activation is a major regulator of TNFα-stimulated IL-6 expression (21Vanden Berghe W. Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. De Bosscher K. Boone E. Haegeman G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). As FAK has been linked to both TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activation (22Zhang H.M. Keledjian K.M. Rao J.N. Zou T. Liu L. Marasa B.S. Wang S.R. Ru L. Strauch E.D. Wang J.Y. Am. J.

Biol.

We employed FAK–/– and FAK-reconstituted fibroblasts as well as a FAK short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown to examine the role of FAK in TNFα-stimulated IL-6 expression. Surprisingly, TNFα-stimulated NF-κB and JNK activation were normal in FAK–/– cells, yet TNFα did not function to promote IL-6 expression in the absence of FAK or in FAK shRNA knockdown cells. We found that TNFα-stimulated FAK catalytic activation, FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation, and the Pro-712/713 proline-rich region of FAK were required for TNFα-stimulated ERK2/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and IL-6 production. Inhibition of Src activity or disruption of Src phosphorylation sites on FAK at Tyr-861 or Tyr-925 did not affect TNFα-stimulated IL-6 expression. However, constitutively activated (CA) MAPK kinase-1 (MEK1) expression in FAK–/– or FAK shRNA cells rescued IL-6 production in response to TNFα stimulation. As TNFα-stimulated FAK activation and IL-6 expression were inhibited by overexpression of the FAK N-terminal FERM but not C-terminal integrin-association domain (termed FRNK), these studies have identified a novel Src-independent pathway whereby FAK kinase activity promotes signaling leading to ERK activation and IL-6 cytokine expression.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK (5904) directed against N-terminal residues 8–27 was generated as described (24Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant TNFα and IL-6 detection kits were from eBioscience (San Diego). Pharmacological inhibitors PP2, PD98059, SB203580, SP600125, and wortmannin were from Calbiochem. Viral Expression—The pLentiLox shRNA vector was used to create stable knockdown of FAK expression in NB8, PC3, and A549 carcinoma cells as described (20Mitra S.K. Mikolon D. Molina J.E. Hsia D.A. Hanson D.A. Chi A. Lim S.T. Bernard-Trifilo J.A. Ilic D. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5969-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Targeting sequences were designed to nucleotides 394–415 of mouse FAK and nucleotides 1089–1107 of human FAK. A scrambled shRNA oligonucleotide forward 5′-tgtctccgaacgtgtcacgtttcaagagaacgtgacacgttcggagacttttttc-3′ and reverse 5′-tcgagaaaaaagtctccgaacgtgtcacgttctcttgaaacgtgacacgttcggagaca-3′ was used as a control. For murine Pyk2 shRNA, the oligonucleotides forward 5′-tgaagtagttcttaaccgcattcaagagatgcggttaagaactacttcttttttc-3′ and reverse 5′-tcgagaaaaaagaagtagttcttaaccgcatctcttgaatgcggttaagaactacttca-3′ were cloned into pLentiLox. Cells were sorted for GFP expression, and the shRNA efficacy was verified by immunoblotting. Rabbit CA MEK1 (S231E/S235E) was a kind gift from Jiahuai Han (The Scripps Research Institute). The 1.2-kb MEK1 cDNA was amplified by PCR, subcloned into pCMV6M to add an N-terminal Myc tag, and the DNA sequence verified. Myc-tagged CA-MEK1 was subcloned into the lentiviral vector pCDH-puro (System BioSciences, Mountain View, CA), and recombinant lentiviruses were produced as described (20Mitra S.K. Mikolon D. Molina J.E. Hsia D.A. Hanson D.A. Chi A. Lim S.T. Bernard-Trifilo J.A. Ilic D. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5969-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). FAK–/– fibroblasts and A549 carcinoma cells were selected in puromycin (5 μg/ml), and CA-MEK1 expression was verified by immunoblotting. HA-tagged FRNK and FRNK Ser-1034 were created and used as described (27Mitra S.K. Lim S.T. Chi A. Schlaepfer D.D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4429-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were infected with five plaque-forming units/cell for Ad-TA (mock control) or with five Ad-TA plus 50 plaque-forming units/cell Ad-FRNK constructs. GFP FAK FERM-(1–402) was generated by PCR with HindIII and BamHI ends and cloned into pEGFP-C1. Quickchange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) site-directed was used to create the double R177A/R178A mutation within pEGFP-C1 FAK FERM. For adenoviral expression, NheI-MluI fragments of pEGFP-C1 FAK FERM-(1–402) were cloned into the EcoRV site of pCMV-Shuttle (Stratagene), and virus was produced using the AdEasy system (Stratagene). Cells were infected with 50 plaque-forming units/cell GFP or GFP-FAK FERM constructs and analyzed after 48 h. GFP-FAK-reconstituted FAK–/– Fibroblasts—GFP-FAK wild type (WT), kinase-inactive (Arg-454), and Phe-925 FAK in the retroviral pBabepuro vector were created as described (20Mitra S.K. Mikolon D. Molina J.E. Hsia D.A. Hanson D.A. Chi A. Lim S.T. Bernard-Trifilo J.A. Ilic D. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5969-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). FAK mutants (Phe-397, Ala-712/Ala-713, and Phe-861) in pCDNA3 (24Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were subcloned into pEGFP-C1 as KpnI-XbaI fragments, and 5′-untranslated sequences from FAK were removed by BspEI/PvuI digestion and replaced by a 275-bp sequence from WT FAK cloned in pEGFP-C1 (28Ilic D. Almeida E.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). All GFP-FAK constructs also contain a triple HA tag at the FAK C terminus and were subcloned into pBabepuro for retrovirus production. Early passage FAK–/– fibroblasts were infected with GFP-FAK retrovirus, selected in puromycin (2 μg/ml), and pooled populations of cells enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Upon expansion, GFP-FAK expression was not stably maintained, and therefore, clonal cell lines were obtained by further sorting, expanded, and GFP-FAK expression verified by immunoblotting. Three or more clonal cell lines for each GFP-FAK construct were pooled together and include the GFP-FAK-reconstituted cells used in this study. IL-6 ELISA—2 × 106 cells were plated and allowed to spread for 4 h and then stimulated with or without TNFα (10 ng/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS for 24 h. IL-6 levels in conditioned media were measured using mouse or human IL-6 ELISA kits (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All samples were analyzed in duplicate. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—FAK+/+ and FAK–/– fibroblasts were trypsinized, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at room temperature, and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) or TNFR2 antibodies. After extensive phosphate-buffered saline washes, cell surface TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were analyzed by flow cytometry and compared with IgG control. Total RNA Preparation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First strand synthesis was conducted using Superscript First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) with random primers and 5 μg of total RNA as template. PCR was performed using TaqPro Complete (Denville Scientific, Metuchen, NJ). IL-6 and β-actin were co-amplified with specific primer pairs (IL-6 forward, 5′-gatgctaccaaactggatataatc; IL-6 reverse, 5′-ggtccttagccactccttctgtg; β-actin forward, 5′-tgtgatggtgggaatgggtcag; β-actin reverse, 5′-tttgatgtcacgcacgatttcc). Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. IL-6 was amplified for 31 cycles, with β-actin primers present in the last 18 cycles as an internal control. Protein Extracts—Total cell protein was prepared using RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were isolated as described (29Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45994-45998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Klenow DNA polymerase. EMSA was performed as described previously (29Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45994-45998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Wild type NF-κB oligonucleotides were 5′-acgtgtgggattttccatg (forward) and 5′-tcgacatgggaaaatcccac (reverse), whereas mutant oligonucleotides contained the sequences 5′-acgtgttacattttcccatg (forward) and 5′-tcgacatgggaaaatgtaac (reverse) with mutations preventing NF-κB binding in boldface type. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—FAK+/+ and FAK–/– fibroblasts were grown in 6-well plates and co-transfected with 5 μg of NF-κB firefly luciferase reporter (from Qilin Pan, The Scripps Research Institute) and 1 μg of TK-Renilla luciferase (Promega, San Luis Obispo) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, transfected cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for an additional 24 h. Cellular proteins were extracted in passive lysis buffer and analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions for dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Immunofluorescence—FAK–/– or A549 cells growing on glass coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.05% Tween 20 detergents for 6 min. Cells were stained with 0.2 ng/ml Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 15 min. Photographs were taken using a monochrome CCD camera (Hamamatsu ORCA ER) and processed using OpenLab software (Improvision, Lexington MA). Phase pictures were taken at ×20 (Olympus, NA = 0.5). FAK in Vitro Kinase (IVK) Assay—FAK immunoprecipitates (5904 polyclonal and protein A-agarose beads) were washed once in RIPA buffer, twice in HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton, and 10% glycerol), and once in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 150 mm NaCl). FAK IVK activity was measured by addition of 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 15 min at 30 °C. The assay was stopped by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Labeled FAK was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Equal immunoprecipitation was verified by anti-FAK blotting. TNFα-stimulated IL-6 Expression Is Dependent on FAK—Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production can influence tumor progression (30Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (11276) Google Scholar). FAK expression and activity promote 4T1 breast carcinoma tumor growth and metastasis in BALB/c mice (20Mitra S.K. Mikolon D. Molina J.E. Hsia D.A. Hanson D.A. Chi A. Lim S.T. Bernard-Trifilo J.A. Ilic D. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5969-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 27Mitra S.K. Lim S.T. Chi A. Schlaepfer D.D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4429-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As 4T1 tumors also induce a leukemoid reaction (31Dupre S.A. Hunter Jr., K.W. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2006; 82: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and metastatic 4T1 lung tumors were associated with lung edema and immune cell infiltration (27Mitra S.K. Lim S.T. Chi A. Schlaepfer D.D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4429-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we tested whether FAK signaling was involved in promoting IL-6 expression as this cytokine promotes inflammation in breast cancer (32Bachelot T. Ray-Coquard I. Menetrier-Caux C. Rastkha M. Duc A. Blay J.Y. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 88: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Basal levels of secreted IL-6 were reduced >10-fold in 4T1 FAK shRNA compared with scrambled (control) shRNA-expressing 4T1 cells as determined by ELISA (Fig. 1A). TNFα is a strong promoter of IL-6 expression in many cell types (33Philip M. Rowley D.A. Schreiber H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). TNFα promoted 3-fold increased IL-6 secretion from 4T1 control cells whereas in 4T1 FAK shRNA cells, IL-6 levels remained below the basal level of 4T1 controls (Fig. 1A). To test whether FAK facilitates TNFα-stimulated IL-6 expression in human tumor cells, we analyzed NB8 neuroblastoma, A549 lung carcinoma, and PC3 prostate carcinoma cells stably expressing either scrambled or FAK shRNA (Fig. 1B). In all three cell lines, 70–90% reduction in FAK expression was accompanied by the inhibition of TNFα-stimulated IL-6 production. As fibroblasts in the tumor stroma can also contribute to the production of inflammatory cytokines (30Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (11276) Google Scholar), we compared the responses of murine FAK+/+p53–/– and FAK–/–p53–/– embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to TNFα stimulation. In wild type FAK+/+ MEFs, TNFα stimulation resulted in a dose-dependent increase of IL-6 protein secretion (Fig. 1C). In contrast, FAK–/– MEFs produced only marginal amounts of IL-6 in response to TNFα. Analysis of TNFα receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 by flow cytometry showed equivalent surface expression in FAK+/+ and FAK–/– MEFs (Fig. 1D), indicating that the defect in TNFα-initiated IL-6 production is associated with the loss of intracellular FAK signaling. These results support the notion that FAK promotes TNFα-induced IL-6 expression in both normal fibroblasts and carcinoma cells of murine and human origin. FAK Promotes IL-6 mRNA Expression—Since TNFα can promote IL-6 mRNA transcription, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses on TNFα-treated FAK+/+, FAK–/–, and FAK-reconstituted FAK–/– MEFs (clone DP3) to determine whether IL-6 expression in FAK–/– MEFs was blocked at the mRNA level. By normalizing the IL-6-amplified band to the internal actin control in all reactions, RT-PCR analysis revealed that basal and TNFα-stimulated IL-6 mRNA levels were reduced ∼3-fold in FAK–/– compared with FAK+/+ and FAK-reconstituted MEFs (Fig. 2A). One caveat of using FAK–/– MEFs for signaling studies is that the expression of the FAK-related kinase Pyk2 is elevated in these cells (34Sieg D.J. Ilic D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To confirm that the inhibition of TNFα-stimulated IL-6 expression was due to lack of FAK and not due to interference by Pyk2, FAK expression in FAK+/+ MEFs was inhibited via lentiviral anti-FAK shRNA (Fig. 2B). Stable knockdown (∼85%) of FAK levels in FAK+/+ MEFs resulted in a 4–5-fold reduction in both basal and TNFα-stimulated IL-6 mRNA levels compared with scrambled shRNA-expressing FAK+/+ MEFs (Fig. 2C). Notably, stable FAK knockdown did not promote an alteration in cell morphology compared with scrambled (Scr) shRNA-expressing MEFs (Fig. 2D), and there was no compensatory change in Pyk2 levels in FAK shRNA-expressing FAK+/+ p53–/– MEFs (data not shown). These results support the conclusion that TNFα effects on IL-6 expression are dependent on FAK and occur in part through effects on IL-6 mRNA expression. FAK Is Not Required for TNFα-induced NF-κB Activation—A major signaling pathway promoting TNFα-induced IL-6 mRNA transcription is through NF-κB activation (12MacEwan D.J. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). As a previous study showed that TNFα-induced NF-κB activation may be impaired in FAK–/– fibroblasts (14Funakoshi-Tago M. Sonoda Y. Tanaka S. Hashimoto K. Tago K. Tominaga S. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29359-29365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we investigated the regulation of NF-κB in FAK+/+ and FAK–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 3). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is cytoplasmically localized and kept inactive in part through an association with the inhibitory protein IκB. TNFα enhances the phosphorylation of IκBα that triggers its rapid degradation, thus releasing NF-κB and allowing for NF-κB nuclear translocation. In both FAK+/+ and FAK–/– cells, TNFα induced a rapid and identical reduction of IκBα protein levels within 5 min followed by IκBα resynthesis after 60 min (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained with anti-FAK shRNA-expressing FAK+/+ cells (Fig. 3B) and Pyk2 shRNA-expressing FAK–/– cells (Fig. 3, C and D). To determine whether IκBα degradation corresponded to NF-κB nuclear translocation, control and TNFα-treated (30 min) cells were separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. TNFα equally stimulated the degradation of IκBα and corresponding to the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit in FAK+/+, FAK shRNA-expressing FAK+/+, FAK–/–, and Pyk2 shRNA-expressing FAK–/– MEFs (Fig. 3D).

Here, we have reported that targeted disruption of the Pbp/Pparbp gene in hepatocytes (PbpΔLiv) impairs liver regeneration with low survival after partial hepatectomy. Analysis of cell cycle progression suggests a defective exit from quiescence, reduced BrdUrd incorporation, and diminished entry into G2/M phase in PbpΔLiv hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy. PbpΔLiv hepatocytes failed to respond to hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, implying that hepatic PBP deficiency affects c-met signaling. Pbp gene disruption also abolishes primary mitogen-induced liver cell proliferative response. Striking abrogation of CCl4-induced hepatocellular proliferation and hepatotoxicity occurred in PbpΔLiv mice pretreated with phenobarbital due to lack of expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes necessary for CCl4 activation. PbpΔLiv mice, chronically exposed to Wy-14,643, a PPARα ligand, revealed a striking proliferative response and clonal expansion of a few Pbpfl/fl hepatocytes that escaped Cre-mediated gene deletion in PbpΔLiv livers, but no proliferative expansion of PBP null hepatocytes was observed. In these PbpΔLiv mice, none of the Wy-14,643-induced hepatic adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas was derived from PBPΔLiv hepatocytes; all liver tumors developing in PbpΔLiv mice maintained non-recombinant Pbp alleles and retained PBP expression. These studies provide direct evidence in support of a critical role of PBP/TRAP220 in liver regeneration, induction of hepatotoxicity, and hepatocarcinogenesis.

Transcription cofactors/coregulators consist of corepressors, coactivators, and coactivator- or corepressor-associated proteins, which participate in nuclear receptor-directed transcription (1Lonard D.M.

The functional significance for the existence of >200 nuclear receptor cofactors is not readily evident, but there is an increasing recognition of the general importance of some of these molecules in gene expression, embryogenesis, cell growth, and oncogenesis, as well as energy and xenobiotic metabolism (1Lonard D.M.

Emerging gene knock-out mouse models show that some of the coactivators that directly bind to transcription factors to enhance gene expression are essential for embryonic growth and survival (see Ref. 3Yu S.

To define the in vivo role of this coactivator, we used conditional mutagenesis in mice and found that deletion of the Pbp/Pparbp gene in liver parenchymal cells (PbpΔLiv) results in the abrogation of PPARα ligand-induced pleiotropic effects, indicating that PBP is essential for PPARα signaling (8Jia Y.

In this study, we have explored the potential role of PBP in liver regeneration and liver tumor development to test the hypothesis that PBP deficiency in hepatocytes affects the function of many genes that control these complex and vital processes (11Michalopoulos G.K.

We have demonstrated a severe impairment of liver regeneration in PbpΔLiv mice subjected to partial hepatectomy. Analysis of immediate early gene expression and cell cycle progression indicates a deficit in exiting from G0 after partial hepatectomy in PBP mutant livers. We have also found that conditional PBP mutant mice do not respond to the cell-proliferating response of mice to TCPOBOP, a well known primary mitogen (14Locker J. Tian J. Carver R. Concas D.

Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Impairment of the cell-proliferative response of PbpΔLiv hepatocytes leads to enhanced proliferative expansion of an occasional PBP+/+ hepatocyte present in these conditional mutant livers, in response to the PPARα ligand Wy-14,643. Accordingly, none of the liver tumors developing in PbpΔLiv mice chronically treated with Wy-14,643 was derived from cells with Pbp null genotype. All liver tumors in these conditional null mutant livers exhibited PBP positivity, implying that PBP is essential for hepatocarcinogenesis. Generation of PBP Conditional Null Mutation in Liver (PbpΔLiv), Partial Hepatectomy, and Treatment with CAR and PPARα Agonists—Homozygous mutant mice lacking PBP in hepatocytes (PbpΔLiv) were generated as described elsewhere (8Jia Y.

Partial hepatectomy was performed under anesthesia to remove 70% of the hepatic mass (16Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). TCPOBOP was administered intraperitoneally at a single dose of 3 mg/kg body weight. Wy-14,643 (0.125% weight/weight) was given in powdered diet for 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months. For long term studies, Wy-14,643 was administered in the diet at a concentration of 0.05% (weight/weight) for one year. To induce liver necrosis, CCl4 (400 mg/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally either into phenobarbital-pretreated or untreated mice (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally daily for 3 days (Sigma). To assess hepatocyte proliferation, BrdUrd (0.5 mg/ml) was administered in drinking water for 3 days and given a single intraperitoneal dose (100 mg/kg body weight) 2 h before killing. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and blood collected from the inferior vena cava was used for assaying serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity using an ALT assay kit (Sigma). The Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies. Liver slices were fixed in 10% formalin or 4% paraformaldehyde, processed for embedding in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with either hematoxylin and eosin or processed for immunohistochemical localization of PBP, BrdUrd, or peroxisomal enoyl-CoA hydratase/l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (l-bifunctional enzyme; l-PBE), the second enzyme of the inducible peroxisomal fatty acid β–oxidation system (8Jia Y.

The antibodies used were anti-PBP (catalog number sc-5334, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-BrdUrd (BD Biosciences), and anti-l-PBE (from T. Hashimoto). The volume occupied by large hepatocytes was estimated using Scion Image software. Microarray Approach—Total RNA isolated from livers using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used for preparing biotin-labeled cRNA and purified, fragmented, and hybridized to 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as described (17Yu S. Viswakarma N. Batra S.K. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 743-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After hybridization, bound cRNA was fluorescently labeled using R-phycoerythrin streptavidin (Molecular Probes), and the fluorescence was intensified by the antibody amplification method. Data were collected and analyzed using the Agilent 2100 expert software. Northern and Immunoblot Analyses—Total RNA isolated from liver was glyoxylated, separated on 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with selected cDNAs. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the primers (forward primer) 5′-GTGCAAGGAGGCCCTAGTGAAGTC-3′ and (reverse primer) 5′-CGGTCTTGAATTCGGATACCTTCG-3′ specific for the c-met proto-oncogene (18Vande Woude G.F. Jeffers M. Cortner J. Alvord G. Tsarfaty I. Resau J. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar). Whole liver proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cyclins. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against phospho-retinoblastoma protein (Ser-780) and phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Hepatocyte Isolation, Culture, and Flow Cytometry—Hepatocytes were isolated from mouse livers using the collagenase perfusion method (19Klaunig J.E. Goldblatt P.J. Hinton D.E. Lipsky M.M. Chacko J. Trump B.F. In Vitro. 1981; 17: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte motility in response to hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) was assessed as described previously (20Huh C.-G. Factor V.M. Sanchez A. Uchida K. Conner E.A. Thorgeirsson S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4477-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). For flow cytometric analysis, liver cells were stained with propidium iodide (Invitrogen), and fluorescence was measured using a Beckman Coulter XL100 flow cytometer equipped with a 488-nm laser. Cell doublets were excluded from the analysis performed using Modfit software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). PBP Is Required for Normal Liver Regeneration—Increased mortality was observed in PbpΔLiv mice usually between 2 and 20 h following partial hepatectomy. The liver-to-body weight ratio, reflective of the regeneration index after partial hepatectomy, increased progressively in wild-type mice, whereas conditional PBP mutant mice failed to show similar increases (Fig. 1A). Liver cell proliferation, as assessed by BrdUrd incorporation, was minimal in PbpΔLiv mice at all times after partial hepatectomy, and this inhibition persisted until 120 h after surgery (Fig. 1B). In contrast, in Pbpfl/fl wild-type controls, BrdUrd incorporation was prominent, with a marked increase in the number of labeled hepatocyte nuclei, with a peak labeling at 36 and 48 h after partial hepatectomy (Fig. 1, B and C). In these livers, cessation of cell proliferation occurred by 120 h after surgery (Fig. 1B). As expected, all hepatocyte nuclei in Pbpfl/fl wild-type livers stained positively for PBP (Fig. 1E). In contrast, PBP expression in PbpΔLiv mouse livers was absent in hepatocytes, and these PBP-negative hepatocytes, in general, appeared smaller in size as compared with hepatocytes in Pbpfl/fl wild-type littermate controls (Fig. 1, D and F). In the PbpΔLiv mouse, an occasional hepatocyte in the centrilobular region of the liver that escaped Pbp gene disruption exhibited PBP staining in the nucleus (Fig. 1F). These cells with abundant cytoplasm are conspicuous in their appearance as compared with the smaller sized PBP null hepatocytes (Fig. 1, D and E). In these PbpΔLiv mouse livers, BrdUrd staining was seen only in these rare PBP-expressing hepatocytes (Fig. 1D), which corresponded to cells expressing PBP (Fig. 1F). Oil red O-stained liver sections obtained 24–72 h after partial hepatectomy showed a moderate degree of macrovesicular steatosis in PbpΔLiv mice as compared with minimally visible microvesicular steatosis associated with early stages of normal regenerative response in wild-type mice (data not shown). The exaggerated hepatic steatosis in the PbpΔLiv mouse suggests that fatty acids influxed into the residual liver in partially hepatectomized mice are oxidized efficiently by the fatty acid-sensing system in PBP+/+-regenerating livers, but this system appears to be defective in PbpΔLiv mouse livers (21Reddy J.K. Rao M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: G852-G858Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 22Fernandez M.A. Albor C. Ingelmo-Torres M. Nixon S.J. Ferguson C. Kurzchalia T. Tebar F. Enrich C. Parton R.G. Pol A. Science. 2006; 313: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is well known that PPARα functions as a lipid sensor in liver, and in the absence of this nuclear receptor, there is increased hepatic steatosis in response to starvation (21Reddy J.K. Rao M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: G852-G858Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). It is now known that PBP is essential for PPARα function (8Jia Y. Qi C. Kashireddi P. Surapureddi S. Zhu Y.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24427-24434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the absence of PBP therefore likely abrogates the PPARα lipid-sensing mechanism after partial hepatectomy. The increased mortality observed in PbpΔLiv mouse livers after partial hepatectomy is attributed to the failure of hepatocytes to sense and metabolize fatty acids transported into the residual liver. Gene Expression Changes in Control and PBP-deficient Livers Following Partial Hepatectomy—We examined the changes in the gene expression profile in the liver of the 0-h control and 3 h after partial hepatectomy by using the microarray approach (14Locker J. Tian J. Carver R. Concas D. Cossu C. Ledda-Columbano G.M. Columbano A. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Togo S. Makino H. Kobayashi T. Morita T. Shimizu T.

The data revealed that ∼25 genes are up-regulated 6-fold or higher 3 h after partial hepatectomy in Pbpfl/fl mice as compared with PbpΔLiv mice (Table 1). Many of the genes up-regulated in the Pbpfl/fl mouse liver in response to partial hepatectomy are immediate early genes known to participate in cell cycle, cell growth, apoptosis, and signal transduction (Table 1; Fig. 2A). These include insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1), IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), E2F transcription factor, metallothionein 1 and 2, follistatin, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, nuclear receptors Nurr1 and NOR1, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45γ (GADD45γ), tumor necrosis factor receptor, interleukin-1 receptor, and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), among others (13Taub R.

Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Kojima I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis confirmed the elevated levels of expression of SOCS3, IGFBP1, and follistatin in Pbpfl/fl livers 3 h post-hepatectomy (Fig. 2A). For example, follistatin, which is known to be a positive regulator in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (26Zhang Y.Q. Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Kojima I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), showed higher levels of expression in PBP+/+ mice but not in PbpΔLiv mice (Fig. 2A). Although we did not ascertain the levels of induction of these genes during the later stages of liver regeneration, with IGFBP1, we noted sustained higher levels of expression of this gene up to 48 h in Pbpfl/fl livers (Fig. 2C). IGFBPs are important positive regulators of liver regeneration (25Leu J.I. Crissey M.A. Taub R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and these immediate early genes are involved in the priming of liver cells after partial hepatectomy for DNA synthesis and replication (11Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2905) Google Scholar, 12Fausto N. Campbell J.S. Riehle K.J. Hepatology. 2006; 43: S45-S53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar, 13Taub R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Lower levels of these cell cycle and cell growth regulatory factors in PbpΔLiv mouse liver reflect the loss of hepatocellular proliferative response following partial hepatectomy. In PbpΔLiv mouse liver, 13 genes were up-regulated 6-fold or higher 3 h following partial hepatectomy as compared with wild-type mice (Table 1). These include transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) type II receptor (tgfbr2) and Smad7 known to inhibit cell proliferation. Smad7 induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the expression of G1 cyclins (27Kitamura K. Aota S.-I. Sakamoto R. Emori T. Okazaki K. Dev. Growth Differ. 2005; 47: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). TGF-β, a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation, plays a role in limiting liver-regenerative response at later periods after partial hepatectomy (11Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2905) Google Scholar, 12Fausto N. Campbell J.S. Riehle K.J. Hepatology. 2006; 43: S45-S53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). We found that its receptor tgfbr2 is expressed at higher levels in PbpΔLiv mouse liver as early as 3 h after partial hepatectomy, implying that the active TGF-β signaling may interfere with liver regeneration in PbpΔLiv mice (Table 1 and Fig. 2B).TABLE 1Microarray analysis following partial hepatectomyGenBank™ accession numberFoldGeneOverexpressed in PBP+/+ liver Apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell growth BI79366666.23Igf1 NM_01977747.27IKKi/IKKepsilon BM24746544.05E2F8 AA79676617.38Metallothionein 2 (MT2) BM24656414.74Pde4b, cAMP specific BC02726211.30Metallothionein 1 (MT1) L0726410.59HB-EGF BM94785510.03Plk3 (Drosophila) NM_0074477.75Ang1 BM1209256.39BCL2-like 11 AK0074106.04GADD45gamma/CR6/OIG37 Signal transduction BB83172512.04SOCS3 NM_0095399.96Zap70 NM_0083629.55Interleukin 1 receptor, type I AI5932929.28Spred-2 NM_0083418.55IGFBP1 NM_0077467.51Map3k8 NM_0080467.5Follistatin BB2770657.42Traf2 binding protein NM_0311857.18SSeCKS M604696.59Osteoprotegerin Transcription factor NM_01361331.01Nurr1 BE69210716.61Nor1 Miscellaneous NM_00887110.11PAI-1/Serpine1 NM_0093789.09ThrombomodulinOverexpressed in PBP-/- liver Apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell growth AA210261969.6Ddx3y BC02311629.49Cgref1 BB30682816.83Inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (Id4) NM_00937110.57Tgfbr2 BE9528058.55Narg2 BE6315497.31Ndrg3 BB2413247.22Smad7 Gene transcription BM2048328.29Ssdp3 BB5430286.66E2f2 Metabolism NM_00925852.61Spink3 BE65287616.93Fatty acid desaturase 3 U3880613.99Adam2 AK0172726.24Lipoprotein lipase Open table in a new tab To further understand the mechanisms responsible for defective liver regeneration, we analyzed the expression levels of proteins involved in cell cycle progression. Expression of cyclin D1 (which correlates with exit from G0) and of cyclin E (which controls S-phase entry) peaked between 30 and 48 h after partial hepatectomy in Pbpfl/fl mice, but these changes were diminished and delayed in their onset in PbpΔLiv mice (Fig. 2D). Because cyclin D1 is thought to stimulate entry into S-phase by phosphorylating phospho-Rb (23Togo S. Makino H. Kobayashi T. Morita T. Shimizu T. Kubota T. Ichikawa Y. Ishikawa T. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Shimada H. J. Hepatol. 2004; 40: 464-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we examined the changes in the phosphorylation state of phospho-Rb and its family member p107 (Fig. 2D). In the Pbpfl/fl mouse liver, the levels of phospho-Rb phosphorylation and p107 were higher than in the PbpΔLiv mouse. The expression of cyclins D and E is generally under the control of immediate early genes, such as c-jun, and their expression reflects exit from the G0 phase (28Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclins A and B regulate S/G2 transition and M phase progression, respectively, of the cell cycle (28Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). In Pbpfl/fl livers, the levels of these two proteins increased, and such increases were not readily apparent in PbpΔLiv mouse liver after partial hepatectomy (Fig. 2D). The phosphorylated c-jun reached peak levels ∼6 h after partial hepatectomy in Pbpfl/fl mouse liver, and this increase was not prominent in the PbpΔLiv mouse liver. Finally, flow cytometric analysis revealed ∼86% liver cells in G0/G1 phase and ∼8% in G2/M in PbpΔLiv mouse livers 36 h after partial hepatectomy. This was in contrast to 54% G0/G1 and 40% G2/M in the wild-type control (data not shown). These results, together with changes in immediate early gene expression and differences in BrdUrd incorporation, establish that disruption of Pbp gene in liver results in reduced G0/G1 transition and a block in entry to the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. We also noted that primary hepatocytes obtained from PbpΔLiv mice failed to migrate in response to HGF/SF in a standard wound-healing assay (Fig. 1G). HGF/SF exerts its effects through its receptor c-met, a proto-oncogene, and defective c-met signaling has been implicated in impaired liver regeneration and in the etiology and progression of certain human cancers (18Vande Woude G.F. Jeffers M. Cortner J. Alvord G. Tsarfaty I. Resau J. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar, 20Huh C.-G. Factor V.M. Sanchez A. Uchida K. Conner E.A. Thorgeirsson S.S. Proc. Natl.

Quantitative PCR data revealed a reduction in c-met mRNA level in PbpΔLiv hepatocytes, suggesting a possible defect in HGF/c-met signaling (Fig. 1H). The HGF/c-met signaling pathway is important for liver regeneration, and it appears that PBP deletion affects this signaling mechanism. Impaired Hepatocellular Proliferation in PbpΔLiv Mouse in Response to a Primary Mitogen—Hepatomitogen TCPOBOP, a ligand and activator for the nuclear receptor CAR, induces robust hepatocellular proliferation (14Locker J. Tian J. Carver R. Concas D. Cossu C. Ledda-Columbano G.M. Columbano A. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Costa R.H. Kalinchenko V.V. Tan Y. Wang J.C. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We undertook a detailed examination of hepatocellular proliferation in Pbpfl/fl and PbpΔLiv mice 24, 30, 36, 48, and 96 h after a single intraperitoneal injection of TCPOBOP. Increases in liver to body weight ratio as well as BrdUrd labeling indices were evident in Pbpfl/fl mice commencing at ∼24 h after TCPOBOP injection, but PbpΔLiv mice showed almost no such alterations (Fig. 3, A and B). We also examined the effect of TCPOBOP on the inducibility of mRNA expression of certain CAR target genes in liver between 0 and 96 h after injection (Fig. 3C). Deletion of Pbp gene significantly attenuated CAR-mediated induction of its target genes after TCPOBOP treatment, whereas TCPOBOP treatment resulted in the induction of hepatic CYP3A11, CYP2B10, CYP1A2, and GSTπ mRNAs that occurred in Pbpfl/fl mice (31Yamazaki Y.

Reduction in Mrp3 (multi drug resistance protein 3) and CAR mRNA levels was noted in TCPOBOP-treated PbpΔLiv mice (Fig. 3C). To further understand the deficit in liver proliferation after TCPOBOP injection, we analyzed the cell cycle-associated proteins. In Pbpfl/fl mice, both cyclin A and cyclin D1 appeared to be up-regulated in liver at 48 and 96 h after TCPOBOP injection but not in PbpΔLiv mice. E2F, which controls cell growth, showed a slightly higher level of expression at 30, 36, and 48 h after TCPOBOP treatment in Pbpfl/fl mice than in Pb"
https://openalex.org/W2011026260,"The essential role of prolactin (PRL) in normal mammary gland growth and differentiation has implicated this hormone in the development and progression of breast cancer. Although Stat5 is the best-characterized mediator of PRL signals, PRL also activates multiple other signals, whose roles in normal and pathologic processes are not well understood. We have shown that PRL stimulates activating protein-1 (AP-1) activity in breast cancer cells, and can cooperate with estradiol in this pathway. AP-1 modulates many processes critical for carcinogenesis, including cell proliferation, survival, transformation, invasion and angiogenesis, and is elevated in many neoplasms, including breast tumors. Here, we investigated the relationship between PRL signals to AP-1 and Stat5. We found that PRL activation of Stat5a and Stat5b, but not Stat1 or Stat3, reduced PRL signals to AP-1, without altering estradiol-induced AP-1 activity. The truncation mutant, Stat5/Δ53C, but not Stat5Y699F, was an effective inhibitor, consistent with a requirement for Stat5 dimerization and nuclear accumulation, but not its C-terminal transactivation activity. The association of Stat5 with AP-1 proteins suggests that this underlies the inhibition. Predictably, the ability of PRL to activate Stat5 and AP-1 was inversely related in mammary cell lines. Further, reduction of Stat5 protein with siRNA in T47D cells, which contain elevated Stat5, increased PRL-induced AP-1 signals, transcripts for the AP-1 target, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and associated invasive behavior. This study points to the importance of cell context in determining the spectrum of PRL-induced actions, which is critical for understanding the contributions of PRL to breast cancer."

Deregulation of Cbfa1 results in metabolic bone diseases including osteoporosis and osteopetrosis. The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) that is required for osteogenesis binds Cbfa1. We reported earlier that the p200 family protein p204, which is known to be involved in the differentiation of skeletal muscle myotubes, cardiac myocytes, and macrophages, also serves as a cofactor of Cbfa1 and promotes osteogenesis. In this study we established that suppression of p204 expression by an adenovirus construct encoding p204 antisense RNA inhibited osteoblast-specific gene activation by Cbfa1 in an osteogenesis assay involving the pluripotent C2C12 mesenchymal cell line. Using protein-protein interaction assays we established that Cbfa1, pRb, and p204 form a ternary complex in which pRb serves as a linker connecting p204 and Cbfa1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed the binding of such a p204-pRb-Cbfa1 transcription factor complex to the promoter of the osteocalcin gene. The pRb requirement of the stimulation of Cbfa1 activity by p204 was established in experiments involving p204 mutants lacking one or two pRb binding (LXCXE) motifs. Such mutants failed to enhance the Cbfa1-dependent transactivation of gene expression as well as osteogenesis.

Cbfa1, also known as Runx2, PeBP2αA, Osf2, or AML3, is a member of the runt family of transcription factors. It is an essential transcription factor of osteoblast and bone formation (4Ducy P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). During skeletal development Cbfa1 was observed first in early mesenchymal condensations and is then principally expressed in osteoblasts (7Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Cbfa1–/– mice exhibit a complete lack of ossification and die immediately after birth (8Komori T. Yagi H.

Cbfa1 maintains osteoblastic function by regulating the expression of several bone-specific genes such as osteopontin and osteocalcin, and by controlling bone extracellular matrix deposition (4Ducy P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Mutations in Cbfa1 are found in 65–80% of individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia (9Lee B. Thirunavukkarasu K. Zhou L.

Interferons are cytokines with antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and cell growth and differentiation regulatory activities (18Lengyel P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 251-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 19Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). The activities of interferons are mediated by numerous interferon-inducible proteins. p204 is a member of the interferon-inducible p200 family proteins that are encoded by genes from the gene 200 cluster (20Choubey D. Lengyel P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Choubey D. Snoddy J. Chaturvedi V. Toniato E. Opdenakker G. Thakur A. Samanta H. Engel D.A. Lengyel P. J.

In the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–216), there is a basic amino acid-rich nuclear localization signal and a canonical export signal required for the translocation of p204 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during skeletal and cardiac muscle differentiation (22Ding B.

Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7024-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of p204 consists of two homologous, partially conserved 200-amino acid segments (a and b) in which pRb binding motifs (e.g. LXCXE) are located. Overexpression of p204 is growth inhibitory due in part to its inhibition of ribosomal RNA transcription by binding of p204 to the ribosomal DNA-specific upstream binding factor transcription factor and inhibiting its sequence-specific binding to DNA (24Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Moss T. Stefanovsky V.Y. Cell. 2002; 109: 545-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The antiproliferative activity of p204 has been attributed to the binding of p204 to pRb by its pRb binding LXCXE motifs (24Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Gribaudo G. Riera L. De Andrea M. Landolfo S.

Overexpression of p204 was found to delay the progression of cells from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle (29Lembo M. Sacchi C. Zappador C. Bellomo G. Gaboli M. Pandolfi P.P. Gariglio M. Landolfo S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). p204 was found to be an important regulator of both skeletal and cardiac muscle differentiation (22Ding B. Liu C.J. Huang Y.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the course of these processes p204 is induced, phosphorylated, and translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (23Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7024-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Ding B. Liu C.J. Huang Y.

Overexpression of p204 accelerates muscle formation (23Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7024-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This is due at least in part to the binding of p204 to the inhibitor of differentiation (Id) proteins including Id1, Id2, and Id3, and overcoming the inhibition by the Id proteins of MyoD activity in the case of skeletal muscle differentiation, and Gata4 and Nkx2.5 activity in the case of cardiac myocyte formation (22Ding B.

J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The p204 gene was isolated as an Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (M-CSF)-responsive gene using a gene trap approach in the interleukin 3-dependent myeloid FD-Fms cell line. Moreover forced expression of p204 strongly repressed the interleukin-3 and M-CSF-dependent proliferation, whereas it promoted the M-CSF-induced macrophage differentiation of FD-Fms cells (32Dauffy J. Mouchiroud G. Bourette R.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). p204 may also play an important role in lymphocytic differentiation based on the observation that 204 mRNA levels are higher in less mature double-positive (CD4 + CD8) thymocytes than in single-positive (CD4+ or Cd8+) thymocytes (33Deftos M.L. Huang E. Ojala E.W. Forbush K.A. Bevan M.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 73-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Notch1, an essential factor for promoting the maturation of T thymocytes can transcriptionally up-regulate p204 gene expression during the maturation to both CD4+ and CD8+ single positive lineages of CD4 + CD8+ double positive thymocytes (33Deftos M.L. Huang E. Ojala E.W. Forbush K.A. Bevan M.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 73-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We previously reported that p204 is involved in osteoblast differentiation, it acts as a cofactor of Cbfa1 and enhances Cbfa1-dependent gene activation and osteogenesis (15Liu C.J. Chang E. Yu J. Carlson C.S. Prazak L. Yu X.P. Ding B. Lengyel P. Di Cesare P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2788-2796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study we extend these findings by elucidating the molecular basis underlying the p204-pRb-Cbfa1 complex-regulated osteogenesis. The results we present here indicate that p204 and pRb synergistically enhance Cbfa1-dependent osteogenesis by forming a p204-pRb-Cbfa1 complex in which pRb bridges p204 and Cbfa1 and that acts in concert in promoting transcription and osteogenesis. Preparation of Three pCMV204mt-type Expression Constructs in Which One or Two pRb Binding Motifs Are Mutated—Each of the a and b domains of p204 contains an LXCXE pRb-binding motif. One or both of these motifs were substituted by an LXGXK sequence in the pCMV204mt-type constructs using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The three constructs were: 1) pCMV204mt-a (substitution in the a domain), 2) pCMV204mt-b (substitution in the b domain), and 3) pCMV204mt-a/b (substitutions in both the a and b domains). The constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Subsequent analysis was performed using Curatools (Curagen, New Haven, CT) and BLAST software (available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Reporter Gene Assays—To examine whether pRb and p204 synergistically transactivate Cbfa1-dependent reporter gene activity, C2C12 cells grown to 50% confluence in 60-mm tissue culture dishes were transfected with 1 μg of Cbfa1-specific reporter construct (p-147luc or p6OSEluc) generously provided by P. Ducy (7Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 34Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), together with 1 μg of pSVGal (internal control plasmid), and various amounts of pEF1 (vector, negative control), pEFCbfa1, pCMVRb, and/or pCMV204 as indicated. 48 h after transfection the cultures were harvested and lysed. Luciferase assays were performed using 20 μl of cell lysate and 100 μl of luciferin substrate (Promega). β-Galactosidase assays were performed using a kit (Tropix, Inc., Foster City, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. β-Galactosidase and luciferase activities were measured using a Mini-Lum luminometer (Bioscan, Washington, D. C.). To examine whether Rb is required for the p204-mediated enhancement of Cbfa1 activity, first Rb-deficient SAOS-2 cells were transfected with 1 μg of a Cbfa1-specific reporter construct (either p6OSE2-luc or p-147luc), 1 μg of pSVGal plasmid, 1 μg of pEF-Cbfa1 expression plasmid, and 1 μg of p204 expression plasmid, as indicated. Next C2C12 cells were transfected with 1 μg of a Cbfa1-specific reporter construct (either p6OSE2-luc or p-147luc), 1 μg of pSVGal plasmid, 1 μg of pEF-Cbfa1 expression plasmid, and 1 μg of pCMV-p204mt-a/b encoding the p204 mutant in which two Rb-binding sites located in the a and b segments of p204 were mutated. To determine whether both Rb-binding sites in p204 are needed for the p204 action in stimulating Cbfa1 activity, pCMV-p204mt-a (Rb-binding site in the a segment is mutated), pCMV-p204mt-b (Rb-binding site in the b segment is mutated), and pCMV-p204mt-a/b and pCMV-204 were used with the Cbfa1 expression construct in the reporter gene assay. The sample was processed as described above. Generation of Recombinant Viruses and Infection of C2C12 Cells—The AdEasy adenoviral vector system (Invitrogen) was used to construct, according to the protocol of the manufacturer, adenoviruses expressing various proteins. The viral constructs include Ad-pRb, Ad-p204, Ad-p204mt-a Ad-p204mt-b, Ad-p204mt-a/b, and Ad-204AS (encoding 204 antisense RNA). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The expression of all recombinant viruses in infected C2C12 cells was tested by Western blotting with appropriate antibodies. C2C12 cells were infected with recombinant Ad-Cbfa1 (kindly provided by Dr. R. Franceschi) and as specified with Ad-pRb, Ad-p204, Ad-p204mt-a, Ad-p204mt-b and Ad-p204mt-a/b. The viruses (1 × 107 plaque-forming units) were added to 5 × 105 cells in 2% fetal bovine serum, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The dishes were rotated every 5 min for the first 15 min to ensure that all of the cells were exposed to the virus. After 1 h the medium was aspirated and the cultures were rinsed twice with serum-free medium and then supplemented with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 4 days after the infection the C2C12 cells were lysed for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay and the media were collected for osteocalcin (OCL) assay. Alkaline Phosphatase and Osteocalcin Assays—Cells were sonicated in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant fractions were collected and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad assay kit. ALP activities were assayed by a standard method with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate (Sigma). Enzyme activity was calculated using a p-nitrophenyl standard curve and expressed as micromoles of p-nitrophenyl phosphate/μg of protein. OCL in the culture medium was assayed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a mouse osteocalcin assay kit (Biomedical Technologies, Staughton, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection and Infection—To examine the interactions of p204, pRb, and Cbfa1 in vivo, 5 × 106 C2C12 or Saos2 (pRb deficient) cells were transfected with 6 μg of expression plasmids (as indicated in Figs. 2, 4, and 6) and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To examine the interaction of p204, pRb, and Cbfa1 during osteogenesis 5 × 106 C2C12 cells were infected with 1 × 107 plaque-forming units of Ad-BMP2. The cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 days and thereafter resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS), supplemented with protease inhibitors, sonicated, and centrifuged to remove the cellular debris.FIGURE 4pRb was required for the enhancement by p204 of the Cbfa1-dependent activation of gene expression. A, schematic structures of wild type and mutant p204 proteins. The N-terminal domain (N-term), the two partially conserved 200-amino acid domains (types a and b) as well as the pRb binding motifs LXCXE are indicated. In the p204mt-a mutant the LXCXE in the a domain was substituted by LXGXK, in the p204mt-b mutant the LXCXEin the b domain was substituted by LXGXK, and in the p204mt-a/b double mutant the LXCXE motifs in both a and b domains were replaced by LXGXK. B, p204 mutants failed to enhance the Cbfa1-dependent expression of the Cbfa1-specific reporter construct p-147luc. C2C12 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Cbfa1 together with pCMV vector, or the pCMV204, pCMV204mt-a, pCMV204mt-b, or pCMV204mt-a/b plasmids. 48 h after transfection the cultures were harvested and β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were determined. Luciferase activities were normalized toβ-galactosidase activities. The leftmost bar indicates a relative luciferase activity of 1. C, p204 did not stimulate the Cbfa-dependent transcription in pRb-deficient Saos-2 cells. Saos2 cells were transfected with the indicated reporter genes (p6OSE2luc or p-147luc) and a plasmid encoding Cbfa1 together with pCMV or pCMV204 plasmid and the cultures were processed as described in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6p204, pRb, and Cbfa1 formed a ternary complex in vivo. A, p204, pRb, and Cbfa1 formed a complex in the transfected C2C12 cells. Cell lysates prepared from C2C12 cells transfected with mammalian expression plasmids encoding p204, pRb, and Cbfa1 were incubated with control IgG (lane 2) or antibodies to p204 (lane 3), pRb (lane 4), or Cbfa1 (lane 5). The cell lysate (positive control, lane 1), and the immunoprecipitates from the cell lysates were examined by Western blotting with antibodies to p204, pRb, and Cbfa1.

Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), washed five times with lysis buffer, released by boiling in 40 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer for 10 min and examined by Western blotting with antibodies to p204, pRb, or Cbfa1. The signals were detected using the ECL chemiluminescent system. To assay whether pRb is required for the binding of p204 to Cbfa1 in vivo, pRb-deficient Saos-2 cells were transfected with pCMV204 and pEF-Cbfa1 together with or without pCMVRb. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to p204 or Cbfa1 was performed as described above. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis using antibodies to p204, pRb, or Cbfa1. GST Pull-down Assay in Vitro—To assay whether pRb is required for the binding of p204 to Cbfa1 in vitro, glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl) preincubated with purified recombinant GST-204 (500 ng) or GST (500 ng) (serving as negative control) were incubated with 500 μg of cell extract from Saos-2 cells, if so indicated, transfected with pCMVRb or C2C12 cells that had been transfected with a pEF-Cbfa1 expression plasmid (positive control). The beads were washed 5 times with washing buffer (0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline). The bound proteins were denatured in sample buffer, released, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the Cbfa1 protein was detected by Western blotting with antibodies to Cbfa1. Knockdown of pRb by Specific siRNA Silencing—For silencing the expression of Rb, 19 nucleotides (AAGTT AAAGGTACCCGATC) of murine Rb were targeted with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using pSuper mammalian expression vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate siRNAs, equimolar amounts of complementary sense and antisense strands were mixed and annealed by slowly cooling to 10 °C in 50 (or is it 100?) μl of reaction buffer (100 mm NaCl and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The annealed oligos were inserted into the BglII/HindIII sites of pSuper vector. The resulting plasmids and the pSuper control vector were transfected into MC3T3-E1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and the level of pRb was determined using Western blotting with anti-pRb antibody. MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with either pSuper-pRb or pSuper vector control (CTR) were cultured in minimal essential medium, a medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under standard cell culture conditions for 3–4 days and harvested for co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. ChIP—To assay whether a p204-pRb-pCbfa1 complex is associated with the osteocalcin promoter in vivo we performed ChIP assays. Using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and murine C3H 10T1/2 progenitor cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding Cbfa1, pRb, and p204. Murine C3H 10T1/2 progenitor cells were cultured in 10-mm dishes and treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) to cross-link the p204-pRb-Cbfa1 complex to the DNA. The cells were washed with cold, phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). The lysates were sonicated to shear the DNA to a length between 200 and 1000 bp. The sonicated supernatant fraction was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and 150 mm NaCl) and incubated with antibodies to Cbfa1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), pRb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), p204, or preimmune serum with rotation at 4 °C overnight. To collect the DNA-protein complexes a salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose slurry was added to the mixture and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h, and the DNA-protein-agarose was pelleted by centrifugation. After extensive washing of the pellet with a series of buffers (Low Salt Wash Buffer, High Salt Wash Buffer, LiCl Immune Complex Wash Buffer, and 1× TE Buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA)) the pellet was dissolved in 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.01 mg/ml herring sperm DNA), and centrifuged to remove the agarose. The supernatant fraction was treated with 20 μl of 5 m NaCl and heated to 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the p204-pRb-Cbfa1-DNA cross-linking. After treatment with EDTA and proteinase K, the supernatant fraction was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol to recover the DNA. For amplification of the osteocalcin promoter region, 10% of the chromatin-immunoprecipitated DNA was PCR amplified using as forward primer 5′-CTGCAATCACCAACCACAGC, and as reverse primer 5′-CTGCACCCTCCAGCATCCAG. 40 cycles of PCR (at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) were performed.

ArsD is a metallochaperone that delivers As(III) to ArsA, increasing its affinity for As(III), thus conferring resistance to environmental concentrations of arsenic. R773 ArsD is a homodimer with three vicinal cysteine pairs, Cys12-Cys13, Cys112-Cys113, and Cys119-Cys120, in each subunit. Each vicinal pair binds As(III) or Sb(III). Alignment of the primary sequence of homologues of ArsD indicates that only the first vicinal cysteine pair, Cys12-Cys13, and an additional cysteine, Cys18, are conserved. The effect of cysteine-to-alanine substitutions and truncations were examined. By yeast two-hybrid analysis, nearly all of the ArsD mutants were able to interact with wild type ArsD, indicating that the mutations do not interfere with dimerization. ArsD mutants with alanines substituting for Cys112, Cys113, Cys119, or Cys120 individually or in pairs or truncations lacking the vicinal pairs retained ability to interact with ArsA and to activate its ATPase activity. Cells expressing these mutants retained ArsD-enhanced As(III) efflux and resistance. In contrast, mutants with substitutions of conserved Cys12, Cys13, or Cys18, individually or in pairs, were unable to activate ArsA or to enhance the activity of the ArsAB pump. We propose that ArsD residues Cys12, Cys13, and Cys18, but not Cys112, Cys113, Cys119, or Cys120, are required for delivery of As(III) to and activation of the ArsAB pump.

Arsenic is a toxic metalloid found in water, soil, and air from both natural and anthropogenic sources. As a consequence of its environmental pervasiveness, arsenic ranks first on the United States Government's Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability (Superfund) Act Priority List of Hazardous Substances (www.atsdr.cdc.gov/cercla/05list.html). Health effects associated with exposure to low levels of arsenite include cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease, neurological disorders, diabetes mellitus, and various forms of cancer (1Abernathy C.O.

Epidemiol. 2004; 160: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In response to its ubiquity in the environment, nearly every organism, from Escherichia coli to humans, have arsenic detoxification mechanisms (3Rosen B.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). E. coli has a chromosomal three-gene arsRBC operon that confers moderate resistance to arsenate (As(V)), arsenite (As(III)), and anti-monite (Sb(III)). However, some operons have two extra genes, arsD and arsA, genes such as the arsRDABC operon in E. coli plasmid R773, and cells expressing the arsRDABC operon are more resistant to As(V) and As(III) than those expressing the arsRBC operon (3Rosen B.P.

ArsA is a As(III)/Sb(III)-stimulated ATPase, the catalytic subunit of the ArsAB As(III)/Sb(III) extrusion pump (5Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ArsD is a homodimer of two 120-residue subunits and has a weak ars operon repressor activity (6Wu J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14257-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently ArsD was identified as an arsenic metallochaperone that delivers As(III) to the ArsA ATPase (4Lin Y.F. Walmsley A.R. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15617-15622Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interaction with ArsD increases the affinity of ArsA for As(III), producing increased efflux and resistance at environmental concentrations of arsenic. The current state of knowledge of metallochaperone-mediated ion transfer derives largely from studies of copper chaperones (8Rosenzweig A.C. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 673-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Most copper chaperones bind copper ions with multiple cysteine ligands. In the metallochaperone CCS (copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase, four cysteine residues from both the N-terminal CXXC (where X can be any residue) motif and the C-terminal CXC motif form the metal-binding sites (MBSs) 2The abbreviations used are: MBS, metal(loid)-binding site; LB, Luria broth; SD, synthetic dextrose; MBP, maltose-binding protein; dibromobimane, 4,6-bis(bromomethyl)-3,7-di-methyl-1,5-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octa-3,6-diene-2,8-dione; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: MBS, metal(loid)-binding site; LB, Luria broth; SD, synthetic dextrose; MBP, maltose-binding protein; dibromobimane, 4,6-bis(bromomethyl)-3,7-di-methyl-1,5-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octa-3,6-diene-2,8-dione; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. (9Eisses J.F. Stasser J.P. Ralle M. Kaplan J.H. Blackburn N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Yet only the C-terminal CXXC motif appears poised to deliver metal ions to the SOD1 site. Atx1 is a yeast copper chaperone that delivers copper to the transport ATPase Ccc2p in the trans-Golgi network (10Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The human homologue of Atx1, Hah1 (Atox1), interacts with the copper-transporting ATP7A and ATP7B pumps, and mutations in these pumps lead to genetic disorders such as Menkes and Wilson diseases (11Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These Atx1-like chaperones are characterized by a conserved CXXC motif in N terminus. However, the x-ray structure of Atx1 indicates the presence of two or even three sulfur ligands (12Rosenzweig A.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 13Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Two of these ligands probably derive from the CXXC motif, and the third could either be an exogenous thiol or a cysteine from a second Atx1 molecule. Cox17, the chaperone for cytochrome c oxidase, also binds copper ions with cysteine ligands. It binds three ions with a conserved CCXC motif in which all three cysteines are required to produce active oxidase. CopZ, characterized by a MXCXXC metal-binding motif, transfers copper ions to CopY, a copper-dependent regulatory protein (14Cobine P.A. George G.N. Jones C.E. Wickramasinghe W.A. Solioz M. Dameron C.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5822-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Copper transfer between CopZ and CopY is dependent on electrostatic interactions (15Wimmer R. Herrmann T. Solioz M. Wuthrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22597-22603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). By extrapolation of the role of thiol-metal ion chemistry in copper chaperones, we considered the possibility that As(III)-thiol interactions might be involved in its chaperone activity. ArsD has three vicinal cysteine pairs, Cys12-Cys13, Cys112-Cys113, and Cys119-Cys120. Cysteine residues 12, 13, and 18 are conserved in all known ArsD homologues. In contrast, the last two vicinal cysteine pairs are found only in some homologues (see Fig. 1). To examine the role of these cysteine residues in ArsD metallochaperone activity, a series of mutants and truncations were created. Analysis of these variants demonstrates that each of the three vicinal pairs forms an independent metalloid-binding site. The data suggest that only the As(III)-binding site formed by the CCX4C motif is required for metallochaperone activity. Strains, Plasmids, and Media—Strains and plasmids used are given in Table 1. E. coli cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Transformation of E. coli cells was carried out using a Bio-Rad MicroPluser. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transformation of yeast cells was carried out using a Geno FAST-Yeast transformation kit (Geno Technologies, St. Louis, MO). Protein Expression and Purification—Cells bearing the indicated plasmids were grown in LB medium overnight at 37 °C and then diluted 50-fold into 1 liter of the same medium. Proteins were expressed by induction with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 of 0.6–0.8 for 3 h. ArsD derivatives with the maltose-binding protein (MBP) at the N terminus were purified from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) bearing plasmid pMAL-Dx series as described (4Lin Y.F. Walmsley A.R. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15617-15622Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). ArsA with a six-histidine tag at the C terminus was purified from cells of strain BL21(DE3) expressing pSE-AB plasmid, respectively, as described (18Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. Biometals. 2000; 13: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Proteins were stored at –80 °C until use, and the concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) or from the absorption at 280 nm (20Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Measurement of Metalloid Binding—The buffer used for purification of MBP-ArsD was exchanged with a buffer containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7, using a Bio-Gel P-6 Micro Bio-Spin column (Bio-Rad). The buffers were degassed by bubbling with argon. Purified protein was incubated at 4 °C with indicated concentrations of Sb(III) in the form of potassium antimonyl tartrate. After 1 h, each sample was passed through a Bio-Gel P-6 column pre-exchanged with the same buffer. Portions (30 μl) were diluted with 2% HNO3, and the quantity of metalloid was measured by inductively coupled mass spectrometry with a PerkinElmer ELAN 9000. Antimony standard solutions in the range of 0.5–10 ppb in 2% HNO3 were obtained from Ultra Scientific, Inc. (North Kingstown, RI). Cross-linking Assays—Cross-linking with dibromobimane, which forms fluorescent adducts with two thiols that are 3–6 Å from each other, was performed as described previously (21Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24465-24470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Purified MBP-ArsD derivatives were buffer-exchanged into 50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7.5, using micro-spin gel filtration columns (Bio-Rad). The proteins were quantified and expressed as molar concentration of ArsD monomer. Proteins (24 μm each) were incubated with 0.5 mm dibromobimane for 20 min at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Formation of fluorescent cross-linked products was visualized at 365 nm and by immunoblotting with anti-serum against ArsD. ATPase Assays—ATPase activity was estimated using a couple assay (22Vogel G. Steinhart R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), as described (23Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MBP-ArsD derivatives were added at a final concentration of 3 μm into an assay mixture containing 5 mm ATP, 1.25 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.25 mm NADH, 10 units of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase with or without various concentrations of potassium antimonyl tartrate or sodium arsenite. ArsA was added to a final concentration of 0.3 μm. The mixture was prewarmed to 37 °C, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.5 mm MgCl2 and measured at 340 nm. The linear steady state rate of ATP hydrolysis was used to calculate specific activity. The reaction volume was 0.2 ml each in 96-well microplates, and the reactions were monitored by microplate reader SPECTRA max 340PC (Molecular Devices). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—A GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid system (24Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) was used to determine protein-protein interactions. AH109, a GAL4-activating HIS3 reporter yeast strain, was co-transformed with ars gene-fused pGBT-Dx (BD-ArsDx) and pACT-X (AD-X) series plasmids. The transformed cells were cultured overnight in SD medium at 30 °C and then washed, suspended, and adjusted to an absorbance at 600 nm of 1 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Portions of the cell suspensions (1 μl) were inoculated on SD agar plates lacking histidine in serial 10-fold dilutions and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Transport Assays—Transport of As(III) by the ArsB pump was assayed as decreased accumulation in cells (25Rosen B.P. Borbolla M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), E. coli strain AW3110 was co-transformed with pSE-X series and pACBAD-Dx series plasmids. The cultures were grown overnight in LB medium and diluted 50-fold into LB medium at 37 °C. After 1 h 0.05% arabinose was added to induce ArsD expression, and the cells were harvested at an A600 of 1. The cells were washed and suspended in 1/10 of the original volume in a buffer consisting of 75 mm HEPES-KOH, 0.15 m KCl, and 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.5, 22 °C. Transport assays were performed with 10 μm sodium arsenite. Arsenic was determined by inductively coupled mass spectrometry with a PerkinElmer ELAN 9000. Protein expression levels were determined by immunoblotting using anti-ArsA and anti-ArsD antibodies. Resistance Assays—E. coli strain AW3110 cells harboring pSE-X series and pACBAD-Dx series plasmids were grown in LB medium overnight and diluted 50-fold into LB medium containing 0.05% arabinose and various concentrations of sodium arsenite, and the absorbance at 600 nm was monitored by microplate reader SPECTRA max 340PC (Molecular Devices) with a path length of 0.24 cm at 37 °C. Contribution of Cysteine Residues to ArsD Metalloid-binding Sites—Alignment of the primary sequence of homologues of R773 ArsD indicates that they all possess a vicinal cysteine pair, Cys12-Cys13, and a single additional cysteine, Cys18 (Fig. 1). Two other vicinal cysteine pairs, Cys112-Cys113 and Cys119-Cys120, are found in some homologues but not others. Cys119-Cys120 is not required for derepression by As(III) when ArsD functions as a weak transcriptional repressor, although the other two vicinal pairs may be (7Chen Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14257-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Li S. Chen Y. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Binding of Sb(III) to purified MBP-ArsD derivatives was measured as a function of Sb(III) concentration. Sb(III) was used because it binds with higher affinity than As(III), which is difficult to measure using this assay. MBP-fused wild type ArsD bound metalloid with a stoichiometry of six Sb(III) per dimer and an apparent Kd of 10–6 m (Fig. 2A), suggesting that there are three metalloid-binding sites (MBSs) per ArsD monomer. Given the insensitivity of the assay, the actual Kd values could be lower. An ArsD derivative, ArsD1–118, in which Cys119 and Cys120 were replaced with a six-histidine tag, bound four Sb(III) per dimer, consistent with the C-terminal vicinal pair, Cys119-Cys120, forming two metalloid-binding sites (termed MBS3) per dimer. The truncation ArsD1–109, in which a stop codon was added after the codon for residue 109, leaving only the first cysteine pair, Cys12-Cys13, bound two Sb(III) per dimer. This N-terminal vicinal pair is termed MBS1. A derivative, ArsD1–118,C12A/C13A, was constructed with the N-terminal cysteine pair changed to alanines and the C-terminal vicinal pair replaced with a six-histidine tag, leaving only the second vicinal pair, Cys112-Cys113. This derivative bound two Sb(III) per dimer; for this reason Cys112-Cys113 was designated MBS2. These results demonstrate that each MBS binds one atom of trivalent metalloid, for a total of three per monomer and six per dimer. Considering that cysteine pair Cys12-Cys13 and Cys18 are conserved in all ArsD homologues identified to date, three derivatives were constructed: ArsD1–109,C12A, ArsD1–109,C13A, and ArsD1–109,C18A. Each variant lacked MBS2 and MBS3 and retained only two of the three conserved cysteine residues. None of the three purified proteins was able to bind Sb(III), suggesting that Cys18, in addition to Cys12 and Cys13, may be involved in the formation of MBS1 (Fig. 2B). Although each protein was produced in normal amounts and was fully soluble, the possibility of misfolding cannot be eliminated. MBS1 Is Involved in Metalloid Transfer and ArsA Activation—ArsD increases the affinity of the ArsA ATPase for As(III) (4Lin Y.F. Walmsley A.R. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15617-15622Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The ability of ArsD derivatives to activate ArsA was examined (Fig. 3). In the presence of ArsD1–118, a truncated ArsD lacking Cys119-Cys120, the half-maximal concentration of As(III) was 10 μm (Fig. 3A), similar to that of wild type ArsD (4Lin Y.F. Walmsley A.R. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15617-15622Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the presence of ArsD1–109, a truncated ArsD lacking both the Cys112-Cys113 and Cys119-Cys120 vicinal pairs, the half-maximal concentration of As(III) was 25 μm. These data suggest that neither MBS2 nor MBS3 is required for ArsD to activate ArsA. In contrast, an ArsD derivative lacking MBS1, ArsD1–118,C12A/C13A, was not able to activate ArsA. In the presence of this derivative, the concentration of As(III) required for half-maximal stimulation of ATPase activity was 1.5 mm, similar to that of ArsA in the absence of ArsD. These data are consistent with participation of MBS1, but not MBS2 or MBS3, in increasing the affinity of ArsA for metalloid. The effects of single cysteine substitutions in MBS1 on the ability of ArsD to activate ArsA were examined (Fig. 3B). Derivatives ArsD1–118,C12A, ArsD1–118,C13A, and ArsD1–118,C18A, each having a cysteine-to-alanine substitution in MBS1 but retaining MBS2, were unable to activate ArsA. Cysteine-to-serine substitutions gave similar results (data not shown). Because metalloids alone augment the ATPase activity of ArsA, it seems plausible that Cys12, Cys13, and Cys18 are directly responsible for delivering As(III) to ArsA to enhance its affinity. In other words, the affinity for As(III) in the ArsD-ArsA complex would be largely determined by ArsD rather than by ArsA. The Effect of Elimination of ArsD As(III)-binding Sites and Truncations on Protein-Protein Interactions—The ability of the six cysteine-to-alanine ArsD mutants and two truncated derivatives to dimerize was examined by yeast two-hybrid analysis (see Fig. 5A). All of the mutants and the C-terminal truncation ArsD1–109, which lacks the last 11 residues, were able to interact with wild type ArsD, indicating that these derivatives are stably produced in yeast and able to form dimers. Although the interaction with the mutant C12A/C13A ArsD seemed somewhat weaker than the others, yeast two-hybrid results are not necessarily quantitative. The truncated derivative lacking the first 13 residues (ArsD14–120) was unable to interact with wild type ArsD, suggesting the involvement of those residues either in ArsD dimerization or protein stability. The effect of the loss of MBS1, MBS2, or MBS3 on ArsD-ArsA interactions was also examined (Fig. 4B). The ability of three ArsD derivatives retaining MBS1 but lacking MBS2 and MBS3 was analyzed: ArsD1–109, in which both MBS2 and MBS3 were deleted; ArsD1–118,C112A, lacking MBS3 and one cysteine residue in MBS2 and ArsD1–118,C112A/C113A, lacking MBS3; and both cysteine residues in MBS2. All three mutants were able to interact with ArsA. In contrast, mutants or truncations lacking Cys12, Cys13, and/or Cys18 were unable to interact, including ArsD1–118,C12A, ArsD1–118,C13A, ArsD1–118,C18A, ArsD1–118,C12A/C13A, and a truncated derivative lacking the first 13 residues (ArsD14–120). Cysteine-to-serine substitutions in MBS1 showed similar results as the cysteine-to-alanine substitutions (data not shown). Although it is possible that the loss of interaction is a result of misfolding, it seems unlikely that the loss in every one of these derivates could be due to misfolding, and it is more reasonable to conclude that it is due to a loss of interaction. When 0.1 mm sodium arsenite was added to the medium, the yeast cells grew more slowly, but the overall results were similar to those without metalloids (data not shown). These results suggest that cysteine residues 12, 13, and 18 are involved in interaction with ArsA. Further truncations of ArsD that lack the first 2, 4, 7, or 11 residues or the last 27, 43, 55, or 77 residues were constructed to establish which regions of ArsD are responsible for dimerization or interaction with ArsA. The truncations were examined for ability to interact with wild type ArsD by yeast two-hybrid analysis. C-terminally truncated ArsD derivatives with as few as 43 N-terminal residues (ArsD1–109, ArsD1–93, ArsD1–77, ArsD1–65, and ArsD1–43) were able to interact with both wild type ArsD and ArsA (see Fig. 6C). In contrast, truncated ArsD derivatives lacking 7 or more residues from the N terminus (ArsD8–120, ArsD12–120, and ArsD14–120) were unable to interact either with wild type ArsD or with ArsA, indicating the involvement of the N terminus of ArsD in protein-protein interaction. These data are consistent with our previous suggestion that the ArsD dimer interacts with ArsA (4Lin Y.F. Walmsley A.R. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15617-15622Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Effect of Elimination of ArsD As(III)-binding Sites on Arsenic Accumulation and Resistance—The ability of ArsD derivatives with cysteine-to-alanine substitutions to enhance the activity of the ArsAB pump in vivo was examined. Although cells expressing arsD1–118,C112A/C113A, which encodes an ArsD derivative having only MBS1, in trans with arsAB accumulated As(III) to nearly the same extent as those expressing wild type arsDAB, cells expressing mutants lacking MBS1 (arsDC12A/C13A or arsDC18A) in trans with arsAB accumulated slightly more As(III) than cells with only arsAB (Fig. 5A). These data are consistent with our proposal that Cys12, Cys13, and Cys18 are involved in functional interaction of ArsD with the ArsAB efflux pump. We also examined whether the same arsD mutants affected resistance conferred by the ArsAB pump. Cells expressing an ArsD mutant having only MBS1 (arsD1–118,C112A/C113A) in trans with arsAB had only a modest reduction in arsenite resistance compared with cells expressing wild type arsDAB. In contrast, cells expressing the mutants lacking MBS1 (arsDC12A/C13A or arsDC18A) were no more resistant than cells with only arsAB (Fig. 5B). These results strongly support our hypothesis that the MBS1, including the Cys12-Cys13 pair and Cys18, but not MBS2 or MBS3, is required for activation of the ArsAB pump. ArsD Cys12, Cys13, and Cys18 in MBS1 Are Cross-linked by Dibromobimane—The proximity of three cysteine thiolates in MBS1 was examined by reaction of MBP-ArsD with the homobifunctional fluorogenic cross-linking reagent dibromobimane (Fig. 6). As expected, MBP-ArsD1–109,C12A/C13A/C18A, lacking all three MBSs, did not react with dibromobimane (Fig. 6, lane 7). MBP-ArsD1–109, having MBS1, formed a highly fluorescent monomer band and a small amount of cross-linked dimer (Fig. 6, lane 1). Fluorescence in the monomer band could be due in part to formation of cross-links between cysteine residues and in part to a slow, nonspecific displacement of the second bromine by water following reaction of the first with cysteine. The cross-linked dimer could form only by reaction of one cysteine in each monomers with a dibromobimane molecule. If only one cysteine residue in MBS1 was changed to an alanine, those derivatives (MBP-ArsD1–109,C12A, MBP-ArsD1–109,C13A, and MBP-ArsD1–109,C18A) still formed a small amount dimer (Fig. 6, lanes 2–4). A derivative with only Cys12 (MBP-ArsD1–109,C13A/C18A) formed fluorescent dimers with dibromobimane (Fig. 6, lane 6). Similarly, MBP-ArsD1–109,C12A/C13A (containing only Cys18) formed fluorescent dimers (Fig. 6, lanes 5). These results suggest that the thiol groups of Cys12, Cys13, and Cys18 are probably 3–6 Å of each other in each monomer and perhaps also near the corresponding cysteine thiolates from the other subunit. Understanding the organization of the metalloid-binding sites in the ArsD metallochaperone is crucial to a molecular description of the metalloid transfer process. Previous studies suggested from the results of indirect assays that the three vicinal cysteine pairs in ArsD form three independent metalloid-binding sites, MBS1, MBS2, and MBS3, per monomer (27Li S. Chen Y. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Li S. Rosen B.P. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Walmsley A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25992-26002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, binding of Sb(III) or As(III) to ArsD was directly measured. Wild type ArsD binds three metalloid atoms per monomer (or six per dimer). Elimination of any of the three vicinal cysteine pairs, Cys12-Cys13, Cys112-Cys113, or Cys119-Cys120, in turn, by mutagenesis or deletion, eliminated MBS1, MBS2, or MBS3, respectively, and a derivative having none of the cysteine pairs bound no metalloid. A cysteine-to-alanine substitution of Cys18, which is conserved in all ArsD homologues identified to date, eliminated binding at MBS1, indicating that MBS1 requires Cys18 in addition to Cys12 and Cys13. MBS3 is not well conserved in ArsD homologues, and no phenotype has been associated with deletion of the C-terminal region containing MBS3. MBS2 has been associated with the weak transcriptional activity of ArsD (27Li S. Chen Y. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but substitutions or deletions of the cysteines in MBS2 do not eliminate the metallochaperone activity of ArsD. In contrast, MBS1 appear to be required for metallochaperone activity. ArsD interacts with ArsA, the catalytic subunit of the ArsAB As(III)-translocating ATPase (4Lin Y.F. Walmsley A.R. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15617-15622Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). ArsA is a pseudodimer, with two homologous halves, A1 and A2, each of which contains a nucleotide-binding domain (29Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). ArsA ATPase activity is activated by binding of As(III) or Sb(III) (23Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the structure three metalloid-binding sites are observed that are formed from residues contributed from both halves at the A1–A2 interface (29Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Each metalloid is coordinated with one residue in A1 and another in A2, forming a “molecular glue” that brings the two halves of ArsA into contact with each other. Because each nucleotide-binding domain has residues from the opposite half of the protein, the formation of this A1–A2 interface is proposed to complete the nucleotide-binding domains, activating catalysis (30Li J. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although Sb(III) is observed in all three ArsA MBSs in the crystal structure, only MBS1, containing Cys113 and Cys422, is a high affinity binding site; the other two may be low affinity sites (31Ruan X. Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9925-9934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although Sb(III) is bound between Cys113 and Cys422 in the crystal structure, Cys422 is actually closer to Cys172 than Cys113, and recent data suggest that Cys172 can participate in MBS1 at some point during the reaction. 3X. Ruan, H. Bhattacharjee, and B. P. Rosen, manuscript in preparation. Thus, we now consider ArsA MBS1 to be an S3 site consisting of those three thiolates. Although the details of metalloid transfer from ArsD to ArsA are presently unknown, the mechanism of copper transfer from copper chaperones to their respective partner proteins is instructive. Pufahl et al. (13Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) first proposed a chemical exchange reaction from transfer of copper from the yeast chaperone Atx1p to the N-terminal domain of the Cu(I)-translocating P-type ATPase Ccc2p. In this transfer, Cu(I) is initially two-coordinately bound to the two cysteine thiolates of the MTCXXC domain in Atx1p. It forms a transient three-coordinate complex with one of the cysteine thiolates of one of the MTCXXC domains of Ccc2p, followed by exchange of the Cu(I) from one of the thiolates in Atx1p to the second thiolate in the Ccc2p domain. This three-coordinate complex then dissociates to form free Atx1p and two-coordinately bound Ccc2p-Cu(I). Similar mechanisms have been proposed for the transfer of human Hah1 copper chaperone and the Menkes and Wilson disease proteins (32Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and the yeast CCS chaperone and its partner superoxide dismutase (33Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In the structure Hah1 is observed as a crystallographic dimer in which Cu(I) is bound four-coordinately to the two MTCXXC cysteine residues. This suggests that Hah1 and its yeast homologue Atx1p form heterodimers with the N-terminal domains of their respective copper pump partners and that transfer would occur by chemical exchange at their interfaces. Docking analysis of Atx1p and Ccc2p supports this mechanism (34Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Bonvin A.M. Structure. 2004; 12: 669-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similarly, the yeast CCS forms a heterodimer with superoxide dismutase and is proposed to use a similar chemical exchange mechanism between cysteine thiolates in the two proteins (33Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). By analogy with the copper chaperones, we propose a hypothetical model of chemical exchange of As(III) between MBS1 in ArsD and MBS1 in ArsA (Fig. 7). Because ArsD and ArsA can be cross-linked with dibromobimane (4Lin Y.F. Walmsley A.R. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15617-15622Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to propose that two proteins interact at their metalloid-binding sites. Although the details of the interaction are not known at this point, the yeast two-hybrid assays with C-terminal ArsD truncations show that the last 77 residues in ArsD are not required for interaction with ArsA. In contrast, two-hybrid analysis with N-terminal truncations suggests that a core region in ArsD from residues 5–43, including MBS1, is involved in both dimerization and interaction with ArsA. Metalloid bound to MBS1 in ArsD is transferred to MBS1 in ArsA, which is then extruded out of the cell by ArsB. Although not shown in the model, it is possible that ArsA MBS2 and MBS3 participate in sequential transfer of metalloid to ArsB. Even though the two monomers can be cross-linked to some degree with dibromobimane, it is not clear whether ArsD MBS1 is composed of cysteines from a single subunit or is formed intermolecularly. For that reason, the model shows only one monomer of ArsD. ArsA is shown in the ATP-bound form because nucleotide is required for metalloid transfer from ArsD to ArsA (4Lin Y.F. Walmsley A.R. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15617-15622Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The model implies that the chemical exchange occurs in three discrete steps, although the order is not known. The model provides a basis for future experiments."

Nerve growth factor (NGF) is the cognate ligand for TrkA, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor for TrkB, and NT-3 for TrkC. NT-3 also binds TrkA as a lower affinity heterologous ligand. Because neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) interactions with TrkA are biologically relevant, we aimed to define the TrkA “hot spot” functional docking sites of NT-3. The Trk extracellular domain consists of two cysteine-rich subdomains (D1 and D3), flanking a leucine-rich subdomain (D2), and two immunoglobulin-like subdomains IgC1(D4) and IgC2(D5). Previously, the D5 subdomain was defined as the primary ligand-binding site of neurotrophins for their cognate receptors (e.g. NGF binds and activates through TRKA-D5 hot spots). Here binding studies with trun-cated and chimeric extracellular subdomains show that TRKA-D5 also includes an NT-3 docking and activation hot spot (site 1), and competition studies show that the NGF and NT-3 hot spots on TRKA-D5 are distinct but partially overlapping. In addition, ligand binding studies provide evidence for an NT-3-binding/allosteric site on TRKA-D4 (site 2). NT-3 docking on sites 1 and/or 2 partially blocks NGF binding. Functional survival studies showed that sites 1 and 2 regulate TrkA activation. NT-3 docking on both sites 1 and 2 affords full agonism, which can be additive with NGF activation of Trk. However, NT-3 docking solely on site 1 is partially agonistic but noncompetitively antagonizes NGF binding and activation of Trk. This study demonstrates that Trk signaling is more complex than previously thought because it involves several receptor subdomains and hot spots.

The neurotrophins are a family of growth factors that regulate proliferation, survival, death, differentiation of neurons in the embryonic and early postnatal stages, neuronal maintenance, synaptic activity, and learning later in life (1Eide F.F. Lowenstein D.H. Reichardt L.F. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 121: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 2Lu B. Pang P.T. Woo N.H. Nat. Rev.

Nerve growth factor (NGF), 4The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; NTF, neurotrophin; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; NT-3, neurotrophin-3; ECD, extracellular domain; NGF30, anti-NGF monoclonal antibody; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; SFM, serum-free media; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; PI, phosphatidylinositol. 4The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; NTF, neurotrophin; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; NT-3, neurotrophin-3; ECD, extracellular domain; NGF30, anti-NGF monoclonal antibody; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; SFM, serum-free media; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; PI, phosphatidylinositol. neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), neurotrophin-4, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are members of the neurotrophin family of polypeptides. Neurotrophins act by binding to two distinct classes of transmembrane receptors. One is the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the other is the Trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors, which includes TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC. All mature neurotrophins bind to p75, but Trks are more selective. NGF interacts selectively with TrkA receptors and BDNF selectively with TrkB receptors. Although NT-3 interacts with TrkC receptors preferably, it is promiscuous and can also bind TrkA and TrkB with lower affinity (3Barbacid M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). The Trk receptors mediate most of the “positive” survival and differentiation signals typically associated with neurotrophin activity. Nevertheless, NT-3-TrkA interactions are biologically relevant. For example, during development NGF and NT-3 act coordinately to select TrkA-expressing sympathetic neurons (4Tessarollo L. Tsoulfas P. Donovan M.J. Palko M.E. Blair-Flynn J. Hempstead B.L. Parada L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14776-14781Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sympathetic neurons from NGF null and NT-3 null mice die when these neurons express high levels of TrkA and negligible levels of TrkC (5Francis N. Farinas I. Brennan C. Rivas-Plata K. Backus C. Reichardt L. Landis S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 411-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). NT-3 mediates neuritogenesis as effectively as NGF, but it affords ∼20–40-fold less survival compared with NGF in NGF-dependent sympathetic neurons (6Belliveau D.J. Krivko I. Kohn J. Lachance C. Pozniak C. Rusakov D. Kaplan D. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Also, NGF and NT-3 acting via TrkA are required for sympathetic axon growth and target innervation (7Kuruvilla R. Zweifel L.S. Glebova N.O. Lonze B.E. Valdez G. Ye H. Ginty D.D. Cell. 2004; 118: 243-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of Trk receptors features five subdomains defined by their homology to other proteins (8Schneider R. Schweiger M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1807-1811PubMed Google Scholar). Near the N terminus is a leucine-rich motif (also known as D2), flanked by two cysteine-rich clusters (Cys-1 and Cys-2, also known as D1 and D3, respectively). Closer to the transmembrane region, there are two immunoglobulin-like subdomains termed Ig-C1(D4) and Ig-C2(D5) (Fig. 1). NTFs transduce trophic signals by binding to the extracellular domain of Trk and stabilizing receptor homodimerization (9Mischel P.S. Umbach J.A. Eskandari S. Smith S.G. Gundersen C.B. Zampighi G.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 968-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is postulated that a conformational change is induced upon ligand binding, which then activates the intrinsic intracellular tyrosine kinase catalytic activity (10Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 2001; 32: 767-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Previous work showed that the D5 subdomains of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC are relevant for binding NGF, BDNF, and NT-3, respectively (11Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Mol.

Moreover, it has also been shown that the D4 subdomain has a role in regulating receptor dimerization (17Arevalo J.C. Conde B. Hempstead B.I. Chao M.V. Martin-Zanca D. Perez P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and in constitutive activation of the receptors (18Zaccaro M.C. Ivanisevic L. Perez P. Meakin S.O. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31023-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The D1 subdomain of TrkA can be utilized by NGF to activate the receptor, through a potentially allosteric or conformational mechanism regulated by co-expression of p75 on the cell surface (18Zaccaro M.C.

The fact that NT-3 has a lower affinity interaction with its heterologous receptors TrkA and TrkB (13MacDonald J.I. Meakin S.O. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1996; 7: 371-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Ryden M. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5623-5627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and that the biological outcomes of NT-3-TrkA interactions are limited (e.g. partial survival, or limited differentiation) (6Belliveau D.J. Krivko I. Kohn J. Lachance C. Pozniak C. Rusakov D. Kaplan D. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggests three nonexclusive possibilities as follows: (i) NT-3 as heterologous ligand may lack some docking sites on TrkA for high affinity binding and full function; (ii) the interaction may take place through epitopes that are distinct from those used by NGF; and/or (iii) receptor conformational or allosteric regulation by each ligand may be different. The goal of our study was to address these possibilities by determining the binding and functional profile of the extracellular domain of TrkA toward cognate NGF or heterologous NT-3 ligands. We report that most of the TrkA activation by cognate or heterologous ligands occurs via the D5 subdomain (site 1). NT-3 binds and activates also at TRKA-D4. Binding of NT-3 to each site seems to be associated with a particular mode of TrkA activation, which can be antagonistic or additive toward NGF. Our study demonstrates that Trk binding and signaling is complex because it involves several receptor subdomains, including potentially allosteric sites that may have positive or negative effects and may be neurotrophin-specific. Neurotrophins—Recombinant human NT-3 produced in Escherichia coli was purchased from Prospec-Tany Techno-Gene LTD (Rehovot, Israel). Nerve growth factor isolated from mouse submaxillary gland was purchased from Prince Labs (Toronto, Canada).

All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and glutamine. Selection for the pCDNA3 expression vector was maintained at 0.4 mg/ml neomycin. Cell Survival Assays—Cell survival was measured by quantitative tetrazolium salt reagent (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma) and optical density readings as described (21Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) at ∼5,000 cells/well in serum-free media (SFM) (PFHM-II; Invitrogen), with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Roche Applied Science). Wells were then supplemented with SFM (negative control), with the indicated concentration of the indicated neurotrophin in SFM (test), or with 5% serum (positive control) for ∼48 h. Cell growth/survival was calculated relative to 2 nm NGF (standardized to 100%). All assays were repeated at least three times, n = 4–6 per assay. Primary Antibodies—Anti-TrkA mouse mAb 5C3 binds to the TRKA-D5 subdomain with Kd ∼ 2 nm and acts as a full agonist of this receptor (22LeSauteur L. Maliartchouk S. Le Jeune H. Quirion R. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1308-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse NGF30 mAb is an anti-NGF mAb that when bound to NGF still allows high affinity binding of NGF to TrkA. The interaction of NGF-NGF30 complexes with TrkA affords survival but not differentiation of TrkA-expressing cells (23Saragovi H.U. Zheng W. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R. Kamen A. Woo S.B. Cuello A.C. Debeir T. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34933-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). NGF-NGF30-FITC complexes are used at 2-fold excess of mAb (20 nm NGF plus 40 nm NGF30 mAb). FACScan Analysis—HEK293 cells expressing 4.1 TrkA/B receptor or NIH-3T3 cells expressing TrkA WT receptor (2 × 105 cells/tube) were resuspended in 50 μl of FACScan buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% BSA, and 0.1% NaN3). Cells were untreated or treated with competitors for 20 min at 4 °C. The saturating concentrations of primary antibodies were then added without washing and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. Excess primary antibody was washed off, and cells were immunostained with fluoresceinated goat anti-mouse IgG. For background staining control, nonspecific mouse IgG or NGF30-FITC antibody in the absence of NGF was used. Maximal binding was obtained by staining with mAb 5C3 or NGF-NGF30 complex without preincubation with neurotrophins. Cells were acquired on a FACScan, and bell-shaped histograms were analyzed using the CellQuest program. Expression of Complete TrkA-Extracellular Domain and TRKA-D4–D5 Domains—Human TrkA-extracellular domain (TrkA-ECD) was produced in baculovirus. TrkA-ECD contains ∼25 kDa of carbohydrate modifications and binds NGF with 3 nm affinity (23Saragovi H.U. Zheng W. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R. Kamen A. Woo S.B. Cuello A.C. Debeir T.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Ig-C1(D4) and Ig-C2(D5) subdomains of human TrkA (TRKA-D4–D5) were produced in yeast. TRKA-D4–D5 was cloned by digestion of human TRKA cDNA with BswI-BbsI, and a 644-bp fragment (coding for amino acids 232–444) was isolated (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The fragment was blunt-ended and ligated to pPICZaB vector (Invitrogen) that was predigested with PmeI. A tag containing Myc sequences and six histidines (Myc-His tag) was put inframe at the C terminus of the protein by double digestion with KpnI-XbaI, followed by blunting and ligation. Clones were selected using Zeocin antibiotic and verified by diagnostic restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. Pichia yeast strain KM71 were transformed and selected in Zeocin antibiotic. Expression was carried out for 4 days in buffered methanol-complex medium (BMMY medium, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10–5 biotin, 0.5% methanol). The supernatant was concentrated (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the secreted His-Myc-TRKA-D4–D5 was purified using Talon resin, which binds the His tag (Clontech). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of the purified protein using anti-Myc antibodies (Invitrogen) revealed the presence of a single band of ∼55 kDa containing the Myc tag. The purity of TRKA-D4–D5 was ascertained by silver staining (Bio-Rad). The protein contains ∼25 kDa of carbohydrate post-translational modifications. Quantification of TrkA-ECD and TRKA-D4–D5—Because of the differences in glycosylation and refolding machinery between the baculovirus and the yeast expression systems, it was expected that there could be qualitative differences between TrkA-ECD and TRKA-D4–D5. Therefore, prior to binding studies, we used mAb 5C3 (22LeSauteur L. Maliartchouk S. Le Jeune H. Quirion R. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1308-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that binds a conformationally sensitive epitope near the NGF-binding site of these recombinant proteins. ELISA studies were done to quantify appropriately folded TrkA-ECD and TRKA-D4–D5 as described previously (23Saragovi H.U. Zheng W. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R. Kamen A. Woo S.B. Cuello A.C. Debeir T. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34933-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 125I-NGF Binding Studies on HEK293 Cells Expressing 4.1 Chimeric Receptors—Scatchard plot analysis of 125I-NGF binding to cells was done as described (22LeSauteur L. Maliartchouk S. Le Jeune H. Quirion R. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1308-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Saragovi H.U. Zheng W. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R. Kamen A.

Viable HEK293 cells expressing the 4.1 chimera (with TrkB-D5 subdomain replaced by subdomain D5 of TrkA) were used as test, and viable wild type HEK293 cells were used to determine nonspecific 125I-NGF binding. Nonspecific binding was always <20% of total binding and was subtracted. All dilutions and washes were done in binding buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% sodium azide), and all procedures were carried out on ice. Cells (5 × 105/100 μl) were added to 100-μl serial dilutions of 125I-NGF in the absence or presence of a constant ratio of a 250-fold excess of cold NTFs as competitors. Final volumes of 200 μl were incubated for 30 min with occasional shaking. Fractionation of cell-bound and free counts was done in two alternative ways, both yielding comparable data. In one method, we performed a single 1-ml wash and then resuspended each cell pellet (100 μl) onto 1.0 ml of a serum/sucrose gradient in a new tube. Centrifugation through this gradient separates cells (and cell-bound counts/min) from supernatant. The tubes were frozen in dry ice immediately after centrifugation, and while frozen, they were cut to separate cells (bottom pellet) from the supernatant (top layer). All washes and supernatants were collected for counting (free counts/min). In the other method, three 1-ml washes were done in a fresh tube, and supernatants (free) and pellet (bound) were collected and counted. Biacore Binding Studies—The rat TrkA-rat TrkB 4.1 ECD chimera was generated by PCR using the full-length rat TrkA-rat TrkB receptor chimeric cDNAs (18Zaccaro M.C. Ivanisevic L. Perez P. Meakin S.O. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31023-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and cloned into pBlue-Bac4.5/V5-His vector (Invitrogen). The integrity and frame of the constructs were verified by sequencing (data not shown). The human TrkA-ECD or rat chimeric ECD were each overexpressed in Sf21 insect cells in XL-401 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KA) as described previously (24Woo S.B. Whalen C. Neet K.E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified with their C-terminal His6 tag by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography and subsequent steps to near homogeneity as shown with SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue (24Woo S.B. Whalen C. Neet K.E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 5S. B. Woo, T. Fritz, J. Page, H. U. Sargovi, and K. E. Neet, manuscript in preparation. The human Trk-ECD wild type or rat 4.1 chimera was immobilized on a CM4 sensor chip using EDC/NHS coupling chemistry and analyzed on a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Piscataway, NJ) using BIA Evaluation software (version 4.0.1, Biacore). For this family, it has been appropriate to compare human and rat receptors, and ligands from either species bind to and activate receptors from either species with no detectable differences. Trk and Akt Activation—NIH-3T3 TrkA WT or HEK293 4.1 TrkA/B chimeric receptors expressing cells were collected (5 × 105/point), washed with PBS, and incubated in SFM at 37 °C for 30 min to reduce background receptor phosphorylation levels. The kinetics of activation of each protein (TrkA WT or 4.1 TrkA/B and Akt) was followed after treatment of rested live cells with different concentrations of ligands for 3, 12, or 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in detergent lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 50 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm iodoacetamide, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin), and protein concentrations were determined with detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis was performed with anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-phospho-TrkATyr-490 (Cell Signaling), and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody (New England Biolabs). Blots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Re-blotting the membranes with anti-actin antibody confirmed equal loading. ELISA—TrkA-ECD (10 ng/well), yeast TRKA-D4–D5 (50 ng/well), or negative control proteins were immobilized onto 96-well microtest ELISA plates (BD Biosciences), followed by blocking with blocking buffer (PBS with 1% BSA) for 1 h. The indicated concentrations of NT-3 or control proteins were added, and the NGF-NGF30 complex was then added. ELISA was performed as described (23Saragovi H.U. Zheng W. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R. Kamen A. Woo S.B. Cuello A.C. Debeir T. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34933-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Representative assay of three independent experiments is shown, n = 4 per assay. Throughout, anti-TrkA mAb 5C3 was used to control the presence of appropriately folded TrkA-ECD or TRKA-D4–D5 on plates. Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed by two-tailed Student's t test, and p values are reported. Significance is p ≤ 0.05 and is indicated in appropriate figures by asterisks. Chimeras Exhibit Trophic Signals in Response to Neurotrophins—Full-length TrkB receptors expressing the D5 (Ig-C2) subdomain of rat TrkA were generated, and the resulting chimera was termed 4.1 (18Zaccaro M.C. Ivanisevic L. Perez P. Meakin S.O. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31023-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The 4.1 TrkA/B chimeric receptor cDNA and TrkA wild type receptor cDNA were stably transfected in HEK293 and NIH cells. The structure and domain organization of TrkA WT and 4.1 TrkA/B chimeric receptor are illustrated in Fig. 1A. Cells cultured in SFM undergo apoptotic death, which can be rescued by neurotrophins if the cells express functional neurotrophin receptors. We have confirmed (data not shown) the differential effect of NT-3 and NGF with various receptor constructs (18Zaccaro M.C. Ivanisevic L. Perez P. Meakin S.O. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31023-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In wild type TrkA-expressing cells, 2 nm NGF affords optimal survival. NT-3 also protects wild type TrkA-expressing cells but with lower potency. NT-3 at 2 nm protects ∼20% and at 500 nm protects ∼100%. In cells expressing the 4.1 TrkA/B chimera, 2 nm NGF affords optimal survival of 100%. NT-3 protects 4.1 TrkA/B chimera-expressing cells but to a significantly lesser degree. NT-3 at 2 nm protects ∼20% and at 500 nm protects ∼30%. Hence, NGF activates fully via the TRKA-D5 subdomain, whereas NT-3 activates only partially via the TRKA-D5 subdomain or via the TrkB-D1–D4 subdomains of the chimera. To understand the relationship between NT-3 and NGF-docking sites on TrkA, we carried out direct ligand binding on purified proteins comprising either the 4.1 TrkA/B ECD or the whole TrkA extracellular domain. Direct Ligand-Receptor Binding Studies—Biacore surface plasmon resonance was used to obtain kon and koff values for NGF and NT-3 binding to TrkA-ECD or TrkA/B 4.1 chimera ECD and to obtain Kd values for these ligands. NGF binds to TrkA-ECD with Kd 1.91 ± 0.03 nm. On the other hand, NT-3 binds to TrkA-ECD with Kd 131 ± 22 nm. The on rates were similar, but the koff was significantly higher for NT-3, leading to the resultant higher Kd (Table 1). The Biacore data for NGF binding to 4.1 TrkA/B chimera ECD shows Kd 292 ± 6 pm, but NT-3 binding to this chimeric protein was beyond the limit of detection (>300 nm), and it was not possible to determine a Kd value. Thus, the main subdomain for NGF and NT-3 binding is TrkA D5, but other subdomains affect the affinity or the kinetics.TABLE 1Summary of binding dataNT-3 competition of ligand bindingIC50 (nm)Purified proteinsCell linesTrkA-ECDTrkA-D4—D5TrkA WT4.1 TrkA/BNGFNot doneNot done40100NGF-NGF30202050>500Biacore direct ligand bindingNGFNT-3TrkA-ECD4.1 TrkA/B ECDTrkA-ECD4.1 TrkA/B ECDKd [nM]1.91 ± 0.030.29 ± 0.006131 ± 22>300kon × 1060.99 ± 0.0021.78 ± 0.020.67 ± 0.06NDkoff × 1031.9 ± 0.030.52 ± 0.00187.3 ± 12.5ND Open table in a new tab NT-3 Competition of NGF-Receptor Binding—Next, we performed Scatchard analysis of 125I-NGF binding to 4.1 TrkA/B-expressing HEK293 cells to further assess NT-3 and NGF interactions at the D5 subdomain (Fig. 2). We previously demonstrated high affinity 125I-NGF binding to 4.1 TrkA/B chimeric receptor expressing cells. This clone expresses ∼50,000 chimeric receptors/cell for specific binding with a Kd 80 ± 30 pm for NGF (18Zaccaro M.C. Ivanisevic L. Perez P. Meakin S.O. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31023-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All of the binding sites were blocked by excess unlabeled NGF. Nonspecific control proteins did not affect 125I-NGF binding (data not shown). In cells expressing chimeric 4.1 receptors, addition of 250-fold excess of unlabeled NT-3 reduced the NGF-binding sites in the 4.1 chimera by 30–50%, without substantially affecting the NGF binding affinity of remaining sites (Fig. 2). Higher concentrations of NT-3 did not increase the degree of competition (data not shown). Hence, the interaction of NT-3 with the 4.1 chimera protein is of low affinity and noncompetitive toward NGF. On the other hand, the binding of NT-3 to wild type TrkA is between 10- and 60-fold lower than NGF (our data and see Ref. 19Ryden M. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5623-5627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Direct binding studies with 125I-NT-3 could not be carried out because this labeled ligand was unavailable to us. Overall, these data suggest that there are NT-3-binding or allosteric sites on TrkA in subdomains other than TRKA-D5. However, these data cannot discriminate whether NT-3 blocking of NGF is because of steric hindrance (binding to an overlapping site of TRKA-D5) or because NT-3 induces receptor conformational changes. NGF and NT-3 Bind to the D5 Subdomain of TrkA—A quantitative FACScan assay and analysis measured competition between TrkA ligands, using TrkA WT receptors expressed on transfected NIH-3T3 cells. The binding of anti-TrkA mAb 5C3, an agonistic TrkA ligand that binds at the D5 subdomain and saturates TrkA at 65 nm (22LeSauteur L. Maliartchouk S. Le Jeune H. Quirion R. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1308-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was blocked by NGF and NT-3 to different levels. NGF at 50 nm inhibited ∼20% of 5C3 binding (Fig. 3, A and C). NT-3 at 50 nm did not compete with 5C3 binding, but 500 nm NT-3 inhibited 5C3 binding by ∼20% (Fig. 3, B and D). These results further suggest that both NGF and NT-3 have binding sites in TRKA-D5. However, to achieve the same degree of"

Chemical cross-linking of focal adhesion preparations with Lomant's reagent demonstrated molecular proximity of endogenous PP1α and tensin, whereas neither focal adhesion kinase nor vinculin was cross-linked and co-precipitated with PP1α, suggesting distinct spatial subdomains within adhesions. Transient expression of truncated tensin showed the N-terminal 360 residues, which comprise a protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain, alone were sufficient for isoform-selective co-precipitation of co-expressed PP1α. Human prostate cancer PC3 cells are deficient in tensin relative to fibroblasts and have fewer, mostly peripheral adhesions. Transient expression of green fluorescent protein tensin in these cancer cells induced formation of adhesions and recruited endogenous PP1α into those adhesions.

Focal adhesions link force-generating elements of the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. These adhesions are assembled initially in response to integrin engagement as cells protrude their leading edge in the process of spreading and migration (1Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3277) Google Scholar, 2Webb D.J. Zhang H. Horwitz A.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 294: 3-11PubMed Google Scholar, 3Webb D.J. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These initial adhesions contain focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, vinculin, and other proteins (4Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3577-3579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these proteins on Tyr residues accompanies the assembly of these adhesions and P-Tyr 2The abbreviations used are: P-Tyr, phosphorylated Tyr; PP1, protein-Ser/Thr phosphatase-1; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; HA, hemagglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. immunostaining is concentrated at these sites (6Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions dynamically exchange protein components as they connect to F-actin filaments and develop contractile force for cell locomotion. Adhesions that produce actomyosin-dependent movement of fibronectin receptors have been called “fibrillar adhesions” (7Zamir E. Katz M. Posen Y. Erez N. Yamada K.M. Katz B.Z. Lin S. Lin D.C. Bershadsky A. Kam Z. Geiger B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) to distinguish them from adhesions near the leading edge of the cell. These adhesions are relatively enriched in tensin, a protein that has a protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain related to PTEN (phosphatase and tensin1 homologue on chromosome 10), an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (8Haynie D.T. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2643-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Davis S. Lu M.L. Lo S.H. Lin S. Butler J.A. Druker B.J. Roberts T.M. An Q. Chen L.B. Science. 1991; 252: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The overall process of focal adhesion maturation can be followed either in cells migrating on two-dimensional surfaces or after re-plating onto matrix-coated surfaces as cells spread. It is now appreciated that focal adhesions are dynamic structures rapidly exchanging constituent proteins (10Webb D.J. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Current work on the dynamics of focal adhesions suggests that Tyr phosphorylation is a major requirement for their turnover. However, results also show Ser/Thr phosphorylation has a role in the assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions (11Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Accumulating data show that focal adhesion proteins are phosphorylated at many Ser and Thr residues (Cell Migration Consortium), and understanding the control of and the functional consequences of these modifications is a challenge for future work. One step will be defining which Ser/Thr kinases and phosphatases are in focal adhesions and the basis for their localization. Our interest in Ser/Thr phosphorylation of myosin and focal adhesion proteins led us some years ago to find protein-Ser/Thr phosphatase-1 (PP1) in focal adhesions of adherent fibroblasts (12Murata K. Hirano K. Villa-Moruzzi E. Hartshorne D.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). There are three predominant PP1 isoforms, named α, δ (or β), and γ-1, that are widely expressed in somatic cells, with nearly identical catalytic domains of about 300 residues, plus 20–30 C-terminal residues that are distinctive between isoforms (13Shima H. Hatano Y. Chun Y.-S. Sugimura T. Zhang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These C-terminal sequences have been used to prepare isoform-specific antibodies to study the cellular distribution of individual isoforms (14Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Villa-Moruzzi E. Margolia R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 15Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F.F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 413: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). One example of isoform specificity is the binding of the PP1δ isoform to MYPT1 and GM regulatory subunits (16Eto M. Kirkbride J.A. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2005; 62: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Colbran R.J. Carmody L.C. Bauman P.A. Wadzinski B.E. Bass M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 366: 156-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The PP1δ isoform also has been reported to associate directly with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which might account for its localization in focal adhesions (18Bianchi M. De Lucchini S. Marin O. Turner D.L. Hanks S.K. Villa-Moruzzi E. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A more recent study indicates that PP1 and glycogen synthase kinase 3 react with different Ser phosphorylation sites in FAK (18Bianchi M. De Lucchini S. Marin O. Turner D.L. Hanks S.K. Villa-Moruzzi E. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study we used isoform-specific antibodies to visualize the α isoform of PP1 in focal adhesions. During cell migration or cell spreading, the PP1α was not seen in focal adhesions near the leading edge, but it was seen in other adhesions and co-localized with tensin. We co-precipitated tensin and PP1α and chemically cross-linked these proteins in preparations of focal adhesions made by detergent extraction of adherent cells. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain of tensin is the domain that resembles a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (8Haynie D.T. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2643-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain is the basis for relationship to PTEN protein and is one of two regions of tensin that mediates binding to adhesions (19Chen H. Lo S.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we show the tensin protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain is sufficient for isoform-specific association with PP1α. The results reveal a new spatial domain within cells where PP1α is targeted, where it can potentially alter the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of select focal adhesion proteins. Reagents—Antibodies against vinculin, paxillin, and tensin were purchased from Sigma, BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), and Chemicon-Upstate (Temecula, CA), respectively. Chemicals not otherwise specified were purchased from Fisher. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against a C-terminal 11-residue peptide of human PP1α with an N-terminal Cys added was affinity-purified using the SulfoLink Coupling Gel Protocol (Pierce) from serum recovered after immunization with peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-PP1δ antibody was produced in parallel. The cDNAs of PP1α and PP1δ were cloned by the reverse transcription-PCR method using cDNA libraries of human placenta and pig aorta, respectively, and confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The amino acid sequence of pig PP1δ is identical to other mammalian PP1δ (accession number AB016735). GFP-tensin vector was characterized previously (19Chen H. Lo S.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Microscopy—Rat embryo fibroblasts (REF52) and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Human prostate carcinoma cells (PC3) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells on coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed, and permeabilized with -20 °C methanol for 2 min, rinsed twice again with PBS, and incubated in a 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS solution for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin-PBS were incubated with the specimen for at least 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing for 5 min with PBS 3 times, the appropriate secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit rhodamine or goat anti-mouse TRITC) diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS were incubated with the specimen. Coverslips were then washed as above and mounted onto glass slides with 10 μl of Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Staining without primary antibody was done with parallel specimens side-by-side. In each case this yielded a blank image as a negative control. Digital images of fixed cells were captured using OpenLab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA) with a Nikon Microphot-SA epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon Plan Apo 60×/1.4 oil immersion objective, filter sets for fluorescein isothiocyanate, Texas Red, and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorophores, and a Hamamatsu Orca II digital camera. Raw digital images (LIF files) were converted to 8-bit TIFF files in OpenLab and further processed (contrast-enhanced, pseudo colored, and merged) using Photoshop 5.5 software (Adobe). Cell Migration and Replating—REF52 cells were replated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, 60 min, or 5 h. Cells were fixed with methanol and stained with a mixture of rabbit polyclonal anti-PP1α (green) and one of the following mouse monoclonal antibodies to known focal adhesion proteins: anti-tensin, anti-paxillin, and anti-vinculin (red). Cells were visualized, and images were processed as above. For two-dimensional migration REF52 cells were grown to 100% confluence on fibronectin-coated coverslips, and the monolayer was “wounded” with a razor blade to remove cells from a stripe across the culture. Cells were allowed to migrate into the wound for 8 h before fixation with methanol and double staining with rabbit anti-PP1α and monoclonal mouse anti-vinculin. Expression and Immunoblotting of HA-PP1α and -δ—COS7 cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 3.5 μg of HA3-PP1α or HA3-PP1δ in the pRK7 vector using EscortV transfection reagent (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol. After a 24-h transfection, cells were lysed with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 10 min and were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE plus immunoblotting. Triplicate replica membranes were prepared and stained in parallel with anti-HA, anti-PP1α, and anti-PP1δ. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, a 100-mm dish of confluent rat aorta smooth muscle cells was lysed on ice for 10 min in 1.0 ml of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 mm PefaBloc. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was split in half; half was mixed with 20 μl of anti-PP1α antiserum, the other half was mixed with 20 μl of pre-immune serum, and 15 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose beads was added to both samples. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the beads were washed 4× by centrifugation with 0.15 ml of the lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad 0.22 μm) that were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted with the blocking buffer. The immunocomplexes were detected using SuperSignal West Pico Luminol/Enhancer Solution (Pierce) and x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat). Cell Permeabilization, Cross-linking, and Immunoprecipitation of PP1 Complexes—REF52 cells were grown to between 75 and 95% confluency in 10-cm dishes, rinsed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm MgCl2 in PBS for 0.5 min at room temperature to prepare cytoskeletons. The chemical cross-linker Lomant's reagent, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was combined with PBS to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml and incubated with these cytoskeletons for 30 min at room temperature. Quenching of the reaction used 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were scraped from the dish in RIPA buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Nonidet P-40), 0.25% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 1 mm PefaBloc). After sonication for 30 s the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,800 rpm at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer, and aliquots were taken from both pellet and supernatant (RIPA Insoluble and RIPA Extract). The RIPA extract was divided into two aliquots. Rabbit pre-immune or rabbit anti-PP1α serum coupled to protein A resin (Sigma P-3476) was incubated with the extract overnight at 4 °C. The resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 2 min, and the supernatant was taken as the sample for immunoblot analysis. Resin was washed 3× with RIPA buffer, then 2× SDS sample buffer was added to the resin. Samples were boiled for 10 min and subjected to 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE using precast gels (Bio-Rad) followed by immunoblotting. Tensin and PP1 Co-expression and Pulldown—Either COS7 or HEK293 cells were seeded at 30% confluence and plated overnight, then transfected using calcium phosphate with 5 μg of pTriEx4 plasmid (Novagen) encoding tensin plus 0.5 μg of pKR7 plasmid encoding HA3-PP1α. After 24–48 h cells were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.8 mm PefaBloc. An extract was recovered as the supernatant after 15 min centrifugation at 13,800 rpm, and a sample was reserved before adsorption to S-protein beads (Novagen) for 1 h. The beads were washed three times by centrifugation with the lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and boiling. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a double-layered gel that was 10% in the bottom half and 6% in the top half to afford resolution of both the tensin proteins and the PP1. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose submerged in transfer buffer by overnight electrophoresis at 50 V and 120 mA. Filters were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and immunoblotted with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated S-probe (Novagen) at 1:10,000 or anti-HA at 1:10,000 followed by anti-mouse-HRP at 1:10,000 dilution and developed as described above. Dynamic Recruitment of PP1 into Focal Adhesions—Rat embryo fibroblasts (REF52 cells) grown on fibronectin-coated coverslips develop focal adhesions across the entire bottom of the cell, and these adhesions contain both vinculin and PP1α, based on immunofluorescent staining after fixation (Fig. 1, A and B). By comparison, REF52 fibroblasts showed localization of the PP1δ isoform primarily along actin stress fibers (Fig. 1, C and D). The specificity of these anti-PP1α and anti-PP1δ antibodies was demonstrated by selective immunostaining of the respective epitope-tagged PP1 isoforms expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 1E) using anti-HA staining (top panel) to show that equivalent amounts of the PP1 proteins were in each lane. The results demonstrate differential localization of these PP1 isoforms in fibroblasts and isoform-specific targeting of PP1α to focal adhesions. The same results using these antibodies were obtained with rat aorta smooth muscle cells (not shown). Thus, differential targeting of these PP1 isoforms occurs in multiple cell types. Focal adhesions are dynamic structures that undergo reorganization in migrating cells. Polarized migration of cells occurs when confluent monolayers are wounded to scrape away cells. Migrating REF52 cells at the edge of the wound formed protrusions with prominent adhesions behind the leading edge that stained for vinculin (Fig. 2, arrows in the bottom panel) but not PP1α (compare Fig. 2, upper panel). PP1α was localized in focal adhesions in the same cell but only in those adhesions further away from the front of the cell nearer to the center of the cell (arrows in top panel, Fig. 2). Vinculin served as a marker for focal adhesions across the entire area of the cell whether or not the adhesions stained for PP1α (Fig. 2, merged image). Because PP1α was not detected in adhesions near the leading edge but in other adhesions in the same cell, we suspected it was being dynamically recruited into adhesions during cell migration. To test this hypothesis REF52 cells were taken into suspension and replated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips. At various times cells were fixed, and focal adhesions were visualized by immunofluorescent staining of endogenous proteins (Fig. 3). The three larger images are merged from the smaller images at the upper left of cells stained for PP1α (green) and the images at upper right for vinculin, P-Tyr, and tensin (red/orange, top to bottom). Adhesions around the perimeter of the cells nearest to the leading edge contained vinculin and P-Tyr proteins but did not stain for PP1α, as seen in the outermost red/orange adhesions in the merged images (Fig. 3, A and B). In these same cells other adhesions localized nearer the center of the cells were double-immunostained for vinculin and PP1α (Fig. 3A) or separately for P-Tyr and PP1α (Fig. 3B). These double-positive adhesions appear yellowish-green in the merged images. Thus, in both cells migrating into a wound (Fig. 2) and cells spreading after replating (Fig. 3) there were two populations of adhesions; peripheral adhesions without PP1α and other, more central focal adhesions that contained PP1α. This differential distribution of PP1α relative to vinculin or P-Tyr (or paxillin, data not shown) was a transient phenomenon only seen while cells were actively spreading. At later times after cells were spread and stationary (t > 4 h) all the focal adhesions were double-stained for both vinculin and PP1α, as seen in Fig. 1, A and B. Tensin is a protein previously localized in a particular subset of focal adhesions called fibrillar adhesions that develop from peripheral adhesions in the course of cell migration (7Zamir E. Katz M. Posen Y. Erez N. Yamada K.M. Katz B.Z. Lin S. Lin D.C. Bershadsky A. Kam Z. Geiger B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Prompted by the differential PP1α localization in adhesions of migrating and spreading cells, we immunostained for endogenous tensin and found co-localization with PP1α in spreading, migrating, and static cells (Fig. 3C). There was full overlap of staining for PP1α and tensin even as early as 30 min after replating. Furthermore, throughout the process of cell spreading in specimens fixed and stained at various times from 30 min to 4 h, we observed spatial coincidence of tensin and PP1α in adhesions. Similar observations were made during spreading of rat aorta smooth muscle cells after replating (not shown), so the phenomenon was not unique to REF52 fibroblasts. We found tensin and PP1α are recruited together at the same time into the same sites during dynamic remodeling of focal adhesions in migrating cells. Spatial Proximity of Tensin and PP1α in Focal Adhesions—Because of the limited spatial resolution of light microscopy, it is not possible to determine whether co-localization of endogenous tensin and PP1α by immunofluorescent staining is due to interaction between the proteins. Therefore, we immunoprecipitated PP1α from extracts of rat smooth muscle cells and by immunoblotting found co-precipitation of a fraction of tensin from the lysate (Fig. 4). The co-immunoprecipitation of tensin was specific for PP1α antiserum relative to an equivalent amount of pre-immune serum as a negative control. As an additional control for specificity, we immunoprecipitated PP1δ from the same extracts and did not recover any detectable tensin (not shown). The results indicated that endogenous PP1α and tensin in fibroblasts were together in a complex that was stable enough to be immunoprecipitated. For additional evidence of endogenous tensin-PP1α association, we optimized conditions to permeabilize REF52 cells without dissociating all the PP1α from focal adhesions using minimal time and low concentrations of Triton X-100 detergent (Fig. 5A). Focal adhesions are complex, relatively insoluble protein assemblies like the cytoskeleton itself, so one faces the experimental challenge of solubilizing these assemblies for analysis while attempting to preserve protein-protein interactions between specific constituents. We resorted to chemical cross-linking of the focal adhesion preparations to identify near-neighbor interactions. Different reaction times and a range of conditions were tested to establish the highest concentration of Lomant's reagent, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) that could be used without diminishing immunostaining of the PP1α in the preparations. Using this optimized protocol, we solubilized the PP1α complexes from dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) cross-linked cytoskeleton preparations with a buffer containing both dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100 and then immunoprecipitated with anti-PP1α antibodies. Cross-links between PP1α and its neighbors were cleaved by chemical reduction of the central disulfide bridge in the reagent, and the separate proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The amount of PP1α recovered at each individual step of the protocol was assayed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5B). These results showed that essentially all the PP1α complexes in the preparations were solubilized (lane 1, extract versus lane 2, residual pellet). Most of the PP1α complexes in the extract were recovered in the specific anti-PP1α immunoprecipitate (lane 7), clearing the remaining supernatant (lane 5). The anti-PP1α precipitation was compared with a non-immune control precipitate, where the complexes remained in the supernatant (lane 4) and were not concentrated in the immunoprecipitated pellet (lane 6). These data demonstrated selective immunoprecipitation of chemically cross-linked PP1α complexes that were solubilized from Triton X-100-resistant cytoskeletons of REF52 fibroblasts. We analyzed these PP1α complexes for recovery of focal adhesion proteins by immunoblotting (Fig. 5C). Both PP1α and tensin were concentrated and greatly enriched in the cross-linked immunocomplexes relative to the amounts of these respective proteins in the permeabilized cells (Input). Control precipitations with pre-immune serum (Fig. 5C, Preim) did not enrich either tensin or PP1α, showing the specificity of immunoprecipitation. In contrast, FAK was not detected in the anti-PP1α immunoprecipitates but was present in the extracts of the cytoskeletons (Fig. 5C). Some vinculin co-immunoprecipitated with PP1α, not pre-immune serum; however, this represented only a miniscule fraction of vinculin in the input fraction, where it was very prominently stained. Thus, despite its relative abundance in cytoskeletons, vinculin was not efficiently cross-linked to PP1α. Our interpretation was that vinculin and PP1α do not exist in molecular proximity to one another in focal adhesions. As an additional control we immunoblotted for actin, but it was not detected in the specific anti-PP1α immunoprecipitates (not shown), so binding to F-actin could not account for an indirect recruitment of tensin to PP1α. The specific co-precipitation after chemical cross-linking showed that endogenous PP1α and tensin were in molecular proximity to one another in focal adhesions. Tensin N-terminal Domain Mediates Association with PP1—In addition to examination of endogenous proteins, we used overexpression of tagged tensin and tagged PP1α in COS7 cells to test for which region of tensin was necessary or sufficient to mediate association with PP1α. Full-length tensin (1735 residues) was fused with a His6-S-peptide tag at the N terminus, and from this construct a series of truncated fusion proteins containing tensin residues 1–360, 1–740, and 1–1462 were created by introducing stop codons by site-directed mutagenesis. These proteins were co-expressed with HA-tagged PP1α, and protein complexes were pulled down from cell extracts using beads conjugated with S-protein. The bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by staining with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated S-protein and immunoblotting for the HA epitope tag. The three truncated tensin His-S tagged proteins were expressed and migrated at the expected sizes in SDS-PAGE. Despite efforts to express nearly comparable amounts of the His-S-tensin proteins, the full-length wild-type tensin was barely detected in pulldown assays, and we suggest this is probably due to a combination of factors, including low level of expression, limited solubilization, and resistance to electrotransfer during immunoblotting. Cells expressing HA-PP1α but no S-peptide tensin fusion protein were used to prepare control extracts to show no HA-PP1α bound to S-protein beads (Fig. 6A, BLK). Even the trace amounts of the full-length, wild-type tensin effectively pulled down HA-PP1α (right lane). Truncations of tensin from the C terminus did not much reduce pulldown of HA-PP1α. Even the shortest protein tested, which contained only residues 1–360 of tensin, pulled down HA-PP1α in this assay. We concluded that the N-terminal residues 1–360 in tensin were sufficient to provide stable association with HA-PP1α. Specificity of tensin for the endogenous α versus the δ isoform of PP1 was confirmed in pulldown assays with overexpressed proteins (Fig. 6B). A tensin S-peptide fusion protein with residues 1–740 was expressed alone as a control (Fig. 6B, left lanes) or co-expressed with either HA-PP1α (center lanes) or HA-PP1δ (right lanes). Immunoblots with anti-HA show about equal levels of overexpressed HA-PP1α and HA-PP1δ (Fig. 6B, upper left). Complexes recovered on S-protein beads (right panels) were analyzed for PP1 recovery by anti-HA immunoblotting for the epitope tag on both isoforms (upper panel) and for recovery of the tagged tensin (lower panel). Only HA-PP1α, not HA-PP1δ, associated with the tensin 1–740 fusion protein (Fig. 6B, upper right panel). These results confirm that the N-terminal half of tensin is sufficient to mediate association with PP1 and dictate isoform specificity. Binding of PP1 to regulatory subunits involves (R/K)VXF m"

In NCR, when readily used (i.e. repressive) nitrogen sources such as glutamine or, in some strains, ammonia are available in sufficient supply, yeast cells will not utilize poorer (i.e. derepressive) nitrogen sources in their environment. This selectivity is accomplished by repressing expression of genes encoding the permeases and catabolic enzymes required for utilization of these poorer nitrogen sources. On the other hand, when the environmental nitrogen supply becomes limiting, Gln3/Gat1-dependent transcription is derepressed. As a result, production and activation of permeases and catabolic enzymes required for utilization of poor (i.e. derepressive) nitrogen sources increase. Thus the cells are equipped to scavenge otherwise unused nitrogen sources until a better nutritional environment returns. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related serine/threonine protein kinases, Tor1,2, are participants in NCR-sensitive transcriptional control (1Beck T. Hall M.N.

The presence of the Gln3-Ure2 complex correlates with exclusion of Gln3 from the nucleus and repression of NCR-sensitive transcription (1Beck T. Hall M.N.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Existing models alternatively suggested that Gln3 phosphorylation was a requirement for Gln3-Ure2 complex formation (1Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) or that the complex stabilized the phosphorylated form of Gln3 (4Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The differing views derived, in part, from the observation that both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of Gln3 were found in Gln3-Ure2 complexes (4Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In any case, complexed and/or phosphorylated Gln3 correlated with its exclusion from the nucleus. When cells are treated with the Tor1,2 inhibitor, rapamycin, events opposite to those described above were envisioned. Tor1,2 no longer positively regulated Tap42, which in turn no longer bound to and inhibited Sit4 phosphatase. Thus freed from negative regulation by Tap42, Sit4 phosphatase dephosphorylated Gln3, and it was this dephosphorylated form that correlated with nuclear localization following rapamycin treatment (1Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 4Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, it was subsequently found that this correlation was observed only at early times (20-30 min) following rapamycin treatment; it was not observed 60 min after treatment (32Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the positive correlation of short term rapamycin treatment, Gln3 dephosphorylation, and nuclear localization have been repeatedly confirmed, our understanding of the mechanistic steps from which these correlations derive are still evolving significantly (Fig. 1, right panel). An early study, which established a physiologically significant association between Tap42 and Sit4, concluded either that Tap42 positively regulated type 2A and type 2A-related phosphatase activities (i.e. the Tap42-phosphatase complex was active for a specific phosphatase function) rather than acting as a negative regulator, or alternatively that a Tap42 function was regulated by the phosphatase (20Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). More recently, the idea of positive Sit4 regulation by Tap42 has re-emerged in the demonstration that association of Tap42 with Sit4 is required for the latter to be active (Fig. 1, right panel) (24Wang H. Wang X. Jiang Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, rapamycin treatment was demonstrated to release the Tap42-Sit4 complex from its association with Tor complex 1 (TORC1), also an event required for the Tap42-Sit4 complex to be active (Fig. 1, right panel) (26Yan G. Shen X. Jiang Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly significant changes have occurred in our understanding of the relationship between Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation and intracellular localization. Although rapamycin treatment and growth of cells in poor nitrogen sources bring about the same outcome, i.e. nuclear Gln3-Myc13 localization, the gross Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation profiles do not similarly correlate (19Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sit4 has recently been shown to be active irrespective of the nitrogen source provided to the cells, i.e. with both good and poor nitrogen sources (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Finally, when SIT4 is deleted, Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation responds to the nature of the nitrogen source provided, i.e. an influence of the nitrogen source on Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation is unmasked (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These observations led Tate et al. (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to suggest the nitrogen source is probably more directly connected to the regulation of one or more protein kinase activities that phosphorylate Gln3-Myc13 than it is to Sit4 phosphatase that continuously dephosphorylates it irrespective of the nitrogen source. Finally, protein kinase Npr1 was reported to be a negative regulator of Gln3, because deletion of NPR1 resulted in constitutive nuclear localization of Gln3 and NCR-sensitive transcription in ammonia-grown cells (34Crespo J.L. Helliwell S.B. Wiederkehr C. Demougin P. Fowler B. Primig M. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37512-37517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been independently shown by two groups that the npr1Δ phenotype derives from loss of the normal ammonia permease activities in the mutant rather than direct negative regulation of Gln3 (35Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28460-28469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Feller A. Boeckstaens M. Marini A.M. Dubois E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28546-28554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The central role of Tap42 in the control of Sit4 and its subsequent regulation of downstream Tor1,2 targets, prompted us to investigate the effects generated by loss of Tap42 on intracellular Gln3-Myc13 localization and phosphorylation. The mutation we elected to analyze was the temperature-sensitive tap42-11 allele because it was one of the mutations initially used to demonstrate many of the Tap42 functions in general (20Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and Tap42 involvement in Gln3 regulation in particular (1Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Although the tap42-11 mutant is rapamycin-resistant at its permissive temperature of 24 °C, the growth inhibitory and other phenotypes it possesses require a nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C (20Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Therefore, before proceeding further, we performed several control experiments, including one that assessed whether the nonpermissive temperature for tap42-11 (37 °C) would affect Gln3 regulation. These experiments led us to the surprising discovery of a new form of Gln3 regulation. (i) Gln3-Myc13 relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm when proline-grown, wild type cells are shifted from 24 to 37 °C. (ii) Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation levels increase in parallel with its relocalization. We further showed that Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation and localization responded similarly to multiple stress conditions, i.e. temperature and osmotic and oxidative stress. Such a broad range of responses is characteristic of a generalized stress response, a form of regulation with which Gln3 has not previously been associated. Equally surprising, the response of Gln3-Myc13 to environmental stress can overwhelm previously studied forms of Gln3 regulation, rapamycin, caffeine, or Msx treatment, nitrogen starvation, limiting nitrogen supply with poor nitrogen sources such as proline, and deletion of URE2. Experiments described below broaden our view of Gln3 regulation from a uni-dimensional response to nitrogen supply to a multivariant response accounting for other environmental conditions representing potentially greater and more immediate threats to the well being of a cell. Strains and Culture Conditions—S. cerevisiae strains used in this work were TB123 (MATa, leu2-3,112, ura3-52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa, GLN3-Myc13[KanMX]), TB136-2a (MATa, leu2-3,112, ura3-52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa, GLN3-Myc13[KanMX], sit4::kanMX), TB138-1a (Mata, leu2-3,112, ura3-52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa, GLN3-Myc13[KanMX], ure2:URA3), and TB123-hog1 (MATa, leu2-3,112, ura3-52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa, GLN3-Myc13[KanMX], hog1::natMX). Strains were grown at 30 °C (unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends) to mid-log phase (A600 nm = 0.5) in Difco yeast nitrogen base medium (YNB) (without amino acids and ammonium sulfate), containing 2% glucose, required auxotrophic supplements (120 μg/ml leucine, 20 μg/ml uracil, 20 μg/ml histidine, 20 μg/ml tryptophan, 20 μg/ml arginine), and the nitrogen source indicated (0.1% final concentration unless otherwise indicated). Rapamycin (Sigma) (dissolved in 10% Tween 20 + 90% ethanol) was added to the cultures, where indicated, to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. Caffeine (20 mm final concentration, added as a solid) or Msx (2 mm final concentration, dissolved in water) were added where indicated. The duration of treatment that occurred prior to cell harvest is indicated in the pertinent figure legends. Cell Collection and Protein Preparation for Western Blot Analysis—Experiments in which yeast were transferred from one medium to another were performed as follows. An exponentially growing culture (A600 nm = 0.4-0.5), or half of it in the case of a split culture, was quickly collected by filtration (at room temperature) and resuspended in an equal volume of the same fresh, pre-warmed (to the specified temperature), preaerated medium; transfer was completed in 35-45 s. Following incubation for the indicated times (see figure legends), cells were collected using the filtration method of Tate et al. (19Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and protein extracts were prepared as described by Cox et al. (32Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the case of treated cultures (rapamycin, Msx, caffeine, sorbitol, sodium chloride, or hydrogen peroxide), a pretreatment (zero time) sample was collected as described above. The remainder of the culture was then treated with the indicated perturbant at the concentration and for the times indicated in the figure legends. Samples of these treated cultures were collected and processed as described above. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cell collection and fixation for indirect immunofluorescence were performed using the method of Cox et al. (37Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as modified by Tate et al. (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol.

Gln3-Myc13 localization was visualized using 9E10(c-Myc) monoclonal antibody (Covance MMS-150P, at a dilution of 1:1000) as the primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, at a dilution of 1:200) as secondary antibody. DNA was visualized using 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) contained in the mounting medium (Sigma) (37Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope with a 100× Plan-Apochromat 1.40 oil objective at room temperature. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio camera and AxioVision 3.0 software (Zeiss). Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator programs. Gamma settings were altered where necessary to avoid any change in cellular detail during processing; changes were applied uniformly to the image. Determination of Intracellular Gln3-Myc13 Distribution—To provide a more representative and complete view of Gln3-Myc13 behavior than can be obtained from a single image of four to eight cells, we scored Gln3-Myc13 localization in 200 or more cells that appeared in multiple, randomly chosen microscopic fields of each experimental sample, including the ones from which the images we present were taken. These cells were placed in one of three categories as follows: cytoplasmic (cytoplasmic fluorescence only), nuclear-cytoplasmic (fluorescence appeared in the cytoplasm as well as co-localizing with DAPI-positive material), and nuclear (co-localizing only with DAPI-positive material). The limitations and reproducibility of the scoring method are described in Tate et al. (33Tate J.J. Feller A. Dubois E. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37980-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28460-28469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize again here, as described in detail earlier, that the nuclear-cytoplasmic category is, of necessity, arbitrary. Placing cells in that category is based on subjective visual observation by the individual scoring the cells; it is not an objective instrument-based measurement. When Gln3-Myc13 is not restricted to a single cellular compartment, scoring depends upon repeated decisions that conclude whether Gln3-Myc13 in a given cell is localized in the center nuclear-cytoplasmic category or a category flanking it. Although intracellular Gln3-Myc13 distribution was scored as carefully and consistently as possible, our interpretations and conclusions are based on straightforwardly detected changes in overall distribution patterns that are apparent in the microscopic images. Histograms of cell scoring results that accompany the images provide supplemental descriptions of our observations. They will undoubtedly differ in detail, however, from those of another observer, who sets their localization category dividing lines differently. Experiments similar to those described were repeated two or more times with similar results. Experiment to experiment variation can be ascertained by comparing similar experimental conditions within the present work (e.g. the 30 °C proline value in Fig. 2B, with the 0 min or control proline values in Fig. 2, D-F, Fig. 3, B and D, Fig. 7F, and Fig. 11B, or similar time points for the ure2 mutant experiments in Fig. 11, B and D), as well as between similar experimental conditions in present and previous work (33Tate J.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 28460-28469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, although we have used the appearance of Gln3-Myc13 fluorescence in both cellular compartments as a descriptor of our observations, we do not a priori assume this appearance represents a separate and unique physiological state.FIGURE 3Multiple environmental stresses elicit relocation of Gln3-Myc13 from the nucleus to cytoplasm of proline-grown cells.

In the homologous peroxidases (EPO, LPO, and TPO) the three-dimensional structure (LPO, Protein Data Bank code 2GJ1) and mass spectrometric analyses show that the heme is also covalently attached to the protein via two ester linkages. It is generally accepted that the cross-linking process occurs autocatalytically and that in LPO the 5-hydroxymethyl bond is formed before the 1-hydroxymethyl bond (11Suriano G. Watanabe S.

Garcia-Quintana L. Delleersnyder V. Fenna R. Bollen A. Moguilevsky N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Exchange of Met243 caused a significant or even complete loss of its chlorination activity as well as a blue shift of the Soret band of 16–18 nm underlining an important role of the vinyl sulfonium band in reaction with chloride and its unusual spectroscopic properties (21Kooter I.M.

Exchanges of Asp94 affected both the overall chlorination and the peroxidase activity and resulted in the formation of two distinct species, one with spectral characteristics of wild-type recMPO and one with spectral features similar to Met243 variants (25Kooter I.M. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Sijtsema N.M. Otto C. Dekker H.L. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The loss of the Glu242 ester bond caused a blue shift of 12 nm in the absorption spectrum and a decrease in the chlorination activity of more than 90% (25Kooter I.M. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Sijtsema N.M. Otto C. Dekker H.L. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we report the consequences of the disruption of the Asp94 to ring C linkage in the individual redox reactions of both the halogenation and the peroxidase cycle as well as the role in ligand binding and redox chemistry. The simplest reaction of MPO is reversible binding of high spin and low spin ligands to the ferric protein (Reaction 1). Upon reaction with hydroperoxides, MPO undergoes a two-electron oxidation to form compound I (oxoiron(IV) with porphyrin π -cation radical) (27Dolphin D. Forman A. Borg D.C. Fajer J. Felton R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) (Reaction 2). Halides (X–) reduce compound I directly to native MPO by a two-electron process (Reaction 3) (15Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C.

Materials—Transfection of recombinant plasmids into Chinese hamster ovary cells, selection and culture procedures for transfected cells, and protein purification protocols were described in detail previously (19Moguilevsky N. Garcia-Quintana L. Jacquet A. Tournay C. Fabry L. Pierard L. Bollen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The variants D94N and D94V were produced as described by Kooter et al. (21Kooter I.M. Pierik A. Merkx M. Averill B.A. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Wever R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11542-11543Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Kooter I.M. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Sijtsema N.M. Otto C. Dekker H.L. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The concentration of the variants was determined by using an extinction coefficient of 72 mm–1 cm–1 at 428 nm for D94V and 62 mm–1 cm–1 at 428 nm for D94N. The latter value takes into account that in D94N the Soret band was split into two maxima (see below) and that the species with the maximum at 413 nm contributed to the absorbance at 428 nm. Principally, extinction coefficients were obtained from the plot of absorbance of the Soret maxima versus protein concentration calculated by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide, obtained as a 30% solution from Sigma, was diluted, and the concentration was determined by absorbance measurement at 240 nm where the extinction coefficient is 39.4 m–1 cm–1 (33Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Hypochlorous acid was obtained from Fluka. The HOCl stock solutions were prepared in 5 mm NaOH and stored in darkness. The HOCl concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ = 350 m–1 cm–1 at 292 nm in 5 mm NaOH) shortly before the experiments (34Morris C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Peroxide and HOCl stock solutions were prepared fresh twice daily. Cyanide, chloride, tyrosine and ascorbate and all other chemicals were also purchased from Sigma at the highest grade available. Circular Dichroism Spectrometry—CD spectra were performed on a Jasco J-600 instrument, equipped with a thermo-stated cell holder, and data were recorded online using a personal computer. Spectra are averages of 12 scans with subtraction of the base line. The quartz cuvette used had a path length of 2 mm. Samples were measured at 25 °C in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and with protein concentrations of 2 μm. Overall Halogenation Activity—Halogenation activity was measured spectrophotometrically (Hitachi U-3000) using the monochlorodimedone (MCD) assay. MCD (100 μm) was dissolved in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and contained either bromide (100 μm) or chloride (100 mm) and 100 nm WT recMPO or Asp94 variant. Upon addition of 100 μm H2O2 MCD was halogenated. Rates of halogenation were determined from the initial linear part of the time traces using an extinction coefficient for MCD at 290 nm of 19.9 mm–1 cm–1 (35Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One unit is defined as halogenation of 1 μmol of MCD per min and 25 °C. In addition, the halogenation activity of recMPO and the Asp94 variants was measured by continuously monitoring hydrogen peroxide concentration polarographically with a platinum electrode covered with a hydrophilic membrane and fitted to the Amperometric Biosensor Detector 3001 (Universal Sensors, Inc.). The applied electrode potential at pH 7 was 650 mV, and the H2O2 electrode filling solution was freshly prepared twice daily. The electrode was calibrated against known concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. All reactions were performed in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 25 °C using 100 μm H2O2 and various concentrations of halides. Reactions were started by the addition of enzyme (100 nm). One unit is defined as consumption of 1 μmol H2O2 per min and 25 °C. Overall Peroxidase Activity—The one-electron donors ascorbate and tyrosine were used to test the effect of exchange of Asp94 on the peroxidase activity (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). Ascorbate oxidation (100 μm ascorbate, 100 μm H2O2, 100 nm WT recMPO or Asp94 variant, 25 °C) was followed by a decrease of absorbance at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient for ascorbate of ϵ290 = 2.8 mm–1 cm–1 (36Nakano Y. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1981; 22: 867-880Google Scholar). Dityrosine formation from tyrosine (200 μm tyrosine, 100 μm H2O2, 50 nm WT recMPO or Asp94 variant, 25 °C) was followed spectrofluorimetrically on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm and an emission wavelength at 405 nm (37Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30434-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Steady-state Ligand Binding—Equilibrium binding of high spin and low spin ligands to wild-type recMPO or the Asp94 variants was performed by spectroscopic titration of 600 nm enzyme in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.0 or pH 7.0, with increasing concentrations of ligands. Dissociation constants (KD) of the various enzyme-ligand complexes were determined at 25 °C, according to a previously described method (38Ferrari R.P. Ghibaudi E.M. Traversa S. Laurenti E. De Gioia L. Salmona M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1997; 68: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, the change in absorbance, ΔAp-v (with p and v representing the corresponding absorption maximum (peak) and minimum (valley) in the difference spectrum), was plotted versus the ligand concentration. A fitting procedure using ΔAp-v = (ΔA∝/[L])/(KD+ [L]), with [L] being the ligand concentration and ΔA∝ the absorbance change at infinite ligand concentration, allowed calculation of KD. Transient State Experiments—The stopped-flow apparatus (model SX-18MV) equipped for both conventional and sequential stopped-flow measurements was from Applied Photophysics (UK). For a total of 100 μl/shot into the optical observation cell with 1 cm light path, the fastest time for mixing two solutions and recording the first data point was of the order of 1.3 ms. All measurements were performed at 25 °C. Cyanide binding and the reaction of D94V or D94N with H2O2 and HOCl was measured in the conventional stopped-flow mode by following the decrease of absorbance at the corresponding Soret maxima of the ferric enzyme (428 nm for both variants) or the Soret maxima of the low spin cyanide complexes (456 nm for both variants). In a typical cyanide binding experiment, one syringe contained ∼1 μm Asp94 variant (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), and the second syringe contained at least a 25-fold excess of cyanide (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). For monitoring compound I formation with H2O2 or HOCl, one syringe contained ∼1 μm ferric enzyme in 200 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the other syringe various concentrations of either H2O2 in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, or hypochlorite in 5 mm NaOH. Three determinations were performed for each ligand or oxidant concentration. The mean of the pseudo-first-order rate constants, kobs, was used in the calculation of the second-order rate constants obtained from the slope of a plot of kobs versus ligand or oxidant concentration. Because of the inherent instability of compound I of Asp94 variants, the sequential stopped-flow (multimixing) techniques were used for determination of rates of the reaction of compound I with one- and two-electron donors. For wild-type recMPO, the conditions were the same as described for the mature enzyme purified from human blood (22Furtmüller P.G. Jantschko W. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Moguilevsky N. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Typically, the Asp94 variant was premixed with a 2-fold excess of H2O2 in the aging loop for 500 ms (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). Finally, compound I was allowed to react with varying concentrations of electron donors. Halide oxidation was followed by monitoring the absorbance change at 428 nm. Formation of compound II mediated by either ascorbate or tyrosine was followed at 456 nm. Reactivity of compound II was investigated either by starting with preformed compound II or, alternatively, by following the reaction of compound I with ascorbate or tyrosine to compound II and back to the ferric enzyme (39Jantschko W. Furtmüller P.G. Allegra M. Liveira M.A. Jakopitsch C. Regelsberger G. Obinger C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the latter case the resulting biphasic curves showed the initial formation of compound II and then its subsequent reaction with ascorbic acid causing an exponential decrease in absorbance. For example, in the first procedure ∼1 μm enzyme was premixed with an equimolar concentration of hydrogen peroxide and a 20-fold excess of homovanillic acid in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. After a delay time of 5 s, compound II was allowed to react with varying concentrations of either ascorbate or tyrosine in the same buffer. Compound II reduction was followed either at the Soret maximum of compound II (456 nm) or ferric enzyme (428 nm). All reactions were also investigated using the diode-array detector (Applied Photophysics PD.1) attached to the stopped-flow machine. Normal data sets were analyzed using the Pro-K simulation program from Applied Photophysics, which allowed the synthesis of artificial sets of time-dependent spectra as well as spectral analysis of enzyme intermediates. Spectroelectrochemistry—All experiments were carried out in an OTTLE cell as described recently for leukocyte MPO (40Battistuzzi G. Bellei M. Zederbauer M. Furtmüller P.G. Sola M. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12750-12755Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The three-electrode configuration consisted of a gold minigrid working electrode (Buckbee-Mears, Chicago), a homemade Ag/AgCl/KClsat microreference electrode, separated from the working solution by a Vycor set, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The reference electrode was calibrated against a saturated calomel electrode before each set of measurements. All potentials are referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode. Potentials were applied across the OTTLE cell with an Amel model 2053 potentiostat/galvanostat. The constant temperature was maintained by a circulating water bath, and the OTTLE cell temperature was monitored with a copper-constant microthermocouple. UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary C50 spectrophotometer. The experiments were carried out under argon in the presence of 20 μm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, phenazine methosulfate, and phenazine ethosulfate used as mediators. Samples (1 ml) containing 4.2 μm recMPO and Asp94 variants in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0, were used. Nernst plots consisted of at least five points and were invariably linear, with a slope consistent with a one-electron reduction. Electronic Absorption Spectroscopy—The electronic absorption spectra of Fe(III) recMPO and the variants D94V and D94N are shown in Fig. 2. For comparison the spectrum of bovine LPO in its ferric form is included, which has its maxima at 412, 501, 545, 595, and 631 nm. The bandwidth and wavelength of the Soret band as well as the wavelength of the charge transfer bands (CT1) at 631 nm are characteristic of a six-coordinated (6c) high spin (HS) aquo ferric heme (41Smulevich G. Neri F. Willemsen O. Choudhury K. Merzocchi M.P. Poulos T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13485-13490Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The electronic absorption maxima of the ferric form of MPO are red-shifted compared with LPO. The Soret band of WT recMPO is at 428 nm, and the spectrum shows additional bands at 498, 570, 622, and 690 nm, suggesting that WT recMPO is also 6c HS in the ferric form (42Brogioni S. Feis A. Marzocchi M.P. Zederbauer M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. Smulevich G. J. Raman Spectrosc. 2006; 37: 263-276Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The spectrum of D94V is similar to WT recMPO with a slight shoulder at the Soret band at 413 nm, whereas in case of D94N the Soret band was split into two maxima, with one maximum at the same wavelength (428 nm) as that of WT recMPO and a blue-shifted maximum (413 nm) similar to that of LPO. The visible spectrum at longer wave-length of both variants suggests a 6c HS state and is very similar to WT recMPO but dissimilar from LPO. It has to be mentioned that, depending on the point in time of protein harvesting from Chinese hamster ovary cells, the signature of the Soret band slightly changed. Generally, in the Soret band of D94V the shoulder at 413 nm became more pronounced in protein expressed by older cells. The purity numbers (A428/A280) of the investigated proteins were 0.69–0.71 (WT recMPO), 0.54–0.56 (D94V), and 0.43–0.46 (D94N), respectively. Far-UV CD spectra (not shown) demonstrate that the overall structure is predominantly α-helical and that exchange of aspartate 94 by either valine or asparagine did not induce structural changes. If conformational changes did occur, they must have been very localized and minimal and thus were undetected by CD. Reduction Potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) Couple of recMPO and Asp94 Variants—Recently, the reduction potential of leukocyte dimeric MPO was shown to be 5 mV at pH 7.0 and 25 °C (40Battistuzzi G. Bellei M. Zederbauer M. Furtmüller P.G. Sola M. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12750-12755Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we have measured the electronic spectra of ferric high spin monomeric recMPO at different applied potentials in the OTTLE cell and could determine an E′0 value of 1 ± 5 mV (not shown), which underlines that the active sites of leukocyte and recMPO exhibit almost identical reactivities (22Furtmüller P.G. Jantschko W. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Moguilevsky N. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and redox properties. Ferrous recMPO and D94V had their Soret band at 475 nm and an additional maximum at 638 nm (not shown). However, upon disruption of the Asp to heme ester bond, the E′0 value decreased by about 55 mV. Fig. 2B shows the electronic spectra of ferric D94N at different applied potentials. It clearly demonstrates that D94N is a mixture of an active and inactive species. Upon reduction only the active species was reduced (direct transition from 428 to 475 nm) (Fig. 2B). From the Nernst plot (Fig. 2B, inset) the E′0 was determined to be –55 ± 10 mV. Binding of Low Spin and High Spin Ligands (Reaction 1)—By binding directly to the heme iron atom cyanide converted the HS (S = 5/2) iron state of recMPO to LS (S = ½) state, thereby shifting the Soret peak from 428 to 456 nm with a clear isosbestic point at 442 nm. In the visible range a distinct peak at 635 nm evolved with clear isosbestic points at 525, 600, and 657 nm (not shown). In WT recMPO, the monophasic transition of ferric MPO to the MPO-cyanide complex occurred with an apparent bimolecular rate constant of (1.6 ± 0.1) × 106 m–1 s–1, pH 7.0. From the intercept of the linear plot (not shown), the dissociation rate constant (koff) was obtained, allowing the calculation of the dissociation constant (KD) of the recMPO-cyanide complex from the koff/kon ratio (1.9 μm). A very similar value was obtained by spectroscopic titration (1.4 μm). The loss of the ester bond in D94V affected neither the kon rate ((1.3 ± 0.2) × 106 m–1)) nor the KD value obtained from either the kinetic plot (2.4 μm) or by spectroscopic titration (1.3 μm). The transition was also monophasic, and the spectral signatures of the cyanide complex fully matched those of WT recMPO (Fig. 3A). Investigating the cyanide binding to D94N again revealed that this variant is a mixture of an active and an inactive species. The monophasic transition resulted in a cyanide complex with an absorption spectrum similar to that of D94V (peak maxima at 456 and 630 nm and isosbestic points at 443, 525, 597, and 656 nm). Fig. 3B clearly demonstrates that the peak at 413 nm did not shift upon addition of cyanide. This suggests that only the species with its Soret band at 428 nm has an accessible heme cavity and can bind cyanide. For D94N, the calculated kon ((7.5 ± 0.3) × 105 m–1 s–1) and the KD (1.6 μm) values were similar to D94V or WT recMPO. In all three proteins the KD values at pH 5 were similar to those at pH 7 (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4Ligand binding to wild-type recombinant MPO (□), D94V (♦), and D94N (•).

The latter is composed of seven repeats (ChBRs) of ∼20 amino acid residues. The translation product of the <i>lytA</i> gene is the low-activity E-form of LytA (a monomer), which can be ""converted"" (activated) <i>in vitro</i> by choline into the fully active C-form at low temperature. The C-form is a homodimer with a boomerang-like shape. To study the structural requirements for the monomer-to-dimer modification and to clarify whether ""conversion"" is synonymous with dimerization, the biochemical consequences of replacing four key amino acid residues of ChBR6 and ChBR7 (the repeats involved in dimer formation) were determined. The results obtained with a collection of 21 mutated NAM-amidases indicate that Ile-315 is a key amino acid residue in both LytA activity and folding. Amino acids with a marginal position in the solenoid structure of the ChBM were of minor influence in dimer stability; neither the size, polarity, nor aromatic nature of the replacement amino acids affected LytA activity. In contrast, truncated proteins were drastically impaired in their activity and conversion capacity. The results indicate that dimerization and conversion are different processes, but they do not answer the questions of whether conversion can only be achieved after a dimer formation step."
https://openalex.org/W2073427794,"DNA tumor viruses are capable of driving quiescent cells into the cell cycle. In case of polyomaviridae, two viral proteins, the large and the small (ST) T antigens are responsible for this outcome. ST interacts with the protein phosphatase PP2A and with chaperons of the dnaK type and leads to the transactivation of several genes, which play a role in S-phase induction. One of these is the transcription factor myelocytomatosis (MYC), which by itself is an important regulator of growth. Microarray analysis has revealed several ST-induced genes, which are also targets of MYC; hence, ST may induce these genes via MYC. Experiments shown here are in line with this assumption. MYC-regulated genes are induced by ST at later times than MYC and a MYC responsive promoter is stimulated by ST. Regulation of MYC occurs through signal transduction pathways, which are co-ordinated by PP2A suggesting that they may be targets of ST. Here, we show that this is the case as important kinases involved in these pathways appear in the active phosphorylated form in the presence of ST. Inhibition of these kinases interferes with MYC induction and inhibition of MYC activity blocks ST-mediated transactivation."
