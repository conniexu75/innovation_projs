https://openalex.org/W1975909437,"Since the early days of research into language and the brain, word meaning was assumed to be processed in specific brain regions, which most modern neuroscientists localize to the left temporal lobe. Here we use event-related fMRI to show that action words referring to face, arm, or leg actions (e.g., to lick, pick, or kick), when presented in a passive reading task, differentially activated areas along the motor strip that either were directly adjacent to or overlapped with areas activated by actual movement of the tongue, fingers, or feet. These results demonstrate that the referential meaning of action words has a correlate in the somatotopic activation of motor and premotor cortex. This rules out a unified “meaning center” in the human brain and supports a dynamic view according to which words are processed by distributed neuronal assemblies with cortical topographies that reflect word semantics."

https://openalex.org/W1994554353,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the downstream component of a protein kinase cascade that acts as an intracellular energy sensor maintaining the energy balance within the cell. The finding that leptin and adiponectin activate AMPK to alter metabolic pathways in muscle and liver provides direct evidence for this role in peripheral tissues. The hypothalamus is a key regulator of food intake and energy balance, coordinating body adiposity and nutritional state in response to peripheral hormones, such as leptin, peptide YY-(3-36), and ghrelin. To date the hormonal regulation of AMPK in the hypothalamus, or its potential role in the control of food intake, have not been reported. Here we demonstrate that counter-regulatory hormones involved in appetite control regulate AMPK activity and that pharmacological activation of AMPK in the hypothalamus increases food intake. In vivo administration of leptin, which leads to a reduction in food intake, decreases hypothalamic AMPK activity. By contrast, injection of ghrelin in vivo, which increases food intake, stimulates AMPK activity in the hypothalamus. Consistent with the effect of ghrelin, injection of 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside, a pharmacological activator of AMPK, into either the third cerebral ventricle or directly into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus significantly increased food intake. These results suggest that AMPK is regulated in the hypothalamus by hormones which regulate food intake. Furthermore, direct pharmacological activation of AMPK in the hypothalamus is sufficient to increase food intake. These findings demonstrate that AMPK plays a role in the regulation of feeding and identify AMPK as a novel target for anti-obesity drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2029096622,"Research has increasingly implicated the striatum in the processing of reward-related information in both animals and humans. However, it is unclear whether human striatal activation is driven solely by the hedonic properties of rewards or whether such activation is reliant on other factors, such as anticipation of upcoming reward or performance of an action to earn a reward. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate hemodynamic responses to monetary rewards and punishments in three experiments that made use of an oddball paradigm. We presented reward and punishment displays randomly in time, following an anticipatory cue, or following a button press response. Robust and differential activation of the caudate nucleus occurred only when a perception of contingency existed between the button press response and the outcome. This finding suggests that the caudate is involved in reinforcement of action potentially leading to reward, rather than in processing reward per se."
https://openalex.org/W1966874118,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) and clusterin can influence structure, toxicity, and accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in brain. Both molecules may also be involved in Abeta metabolism prior to its deposition. To assess this possibility, we compared PDAPP transgenic mice that develop age-dependent Abeta accumulation in the absence of apoE or clusterin as well as in the absence of both proteins. apoE(-/-) and clusterin(-/-) mice accumulated similar Abeta levels but much less fibrillar Abeta. In contrast, apoE(-/-)/clusterin(-/-) mice had both earlier onset and markedly increased Abeta and amyloid deposition. Both apoE(-/-) and apoE(-/-)/clusterin(-/-) mice had elevated CSF and brain interstitial fluid Abeta, as well as significant differences in the elimination half-life of interstitial fluid Abeta measured by in vivo microdialysis. These findings demonstrate additive effects of apoE and clusterin on influencing Abeta deposition and that apoE plays an important role in regulating extracellular CNS Abeta metabolism independent of Abeta synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1988628392,"Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are thought to encode reward prediction error. Reward prediction can be improved if any relevant context is taken into account. We found that monkey DA neurons can encode a context-dependent prediction error. In the first noncontextual task, a light stimulus was randomly followed by reward, with a fixed equal probability. The response of DA neurons was positively correlated with the number of preceding unrewarded trials and could be simulated by a conventional temporal difference (TD) model. In the second contextual task, a reward-indicating light stimulus was presented with the probability that, while fixed overall, was incremented as a function of the number of preceding unrewarded trials. The DA neuronal response then was negatively correlated with this number. This history effect corresponded to the prediction error based on the conditional probability of reward and could be simulated only by implementing the relevant context into the TD model."

https://openalex.org/W1989576874,"The elaboration of dendrites is fundamental to the establishment of neuronal polarity and connectivity, but the mechanisms that underlie dendritic morphogenesis are poorly understood. We found that the genetic knockdown of the transcription factor NeuroD in primary granule neurons including in organotypic cerebellar slices profoundly impaired the generation and maintenance of dendrites while sparing the development of axons. We also found that NeuroD mediated neuronal activity-dependent dendritogenesis. The activity-induced protein kinase CaMKII catalyzed the phosphorylation of NeuroD at distinct sites, including endogenous NeuroD at Ser336 in primary neurons, and thereby stimulated dendritic growth. These findings uncover an essential function for NeuroD in granule neuron dendritic morphogenesis. Our study also defines the CaMKII-NeuroD signaling pathway as a novel mechanism underlying activity-regulated dendritic growth that may play important roles in the developing and mature brain."
https://openalex.org/W2074698051,"Genetic calcium probes offer tremendous potential in the fields of neuroscience, cell biology, and pharmaceutical screening. Previously, ratiometric and non-ratiometric indicators of cellular calcium dynamics have been described that consist of mutants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as fluorophores and calmodulin as calcium-binding moiety in several configurations. However, these calmodulin-based types of probes have a series of deficiencies, such as reduced dynamic ranges, when expressed within transgenic organisms and lack of calcium sensitivity in certain targetings. We developed novel types of calcium probes based on troponin C variants from skeletal and cardiac muscle. These indicators have ratio changes up to 140%, Kds ranging from 470 nm to 29 μm, and improved subcellular targeting properties. We targeted the indicators to the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells and primary hippocampal neurons. Upon long lasting depolarization, submembrane calcium levels in hippocampal neurons were found to be in equilibrium with bulk cytosolic calcium levels, suggesting no standing gradient persists from the membrane toward the cytosol. We expect that such novel indicators using specialized calcium sensing proteins will be minimally interacting with the cellular biochemical machinery.

We expect that such novel indicators using specialized calcium sensing proteins will be minimally interacting with the cellular biochemical machinery. Genetically encoded fluorescent indicators used to visualize cellular calcium levels have many advantages over other fluorescent dyes that have to be applied externally. They are generated in situ inside cells after transfection, do not require cofactors, can be specifically targeted to cell organelles and cellular microenvironments, and do not leak out of cells during longer recording sessions. Furthermore, they can be expressed within intact tissues of transgenic organisms and thus solve the problem of loading an indicator dye into tissue, while allowing the labeling of specific subsets of cells of interest (for review, see Ref. 1Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Google Scholar). Two classes of green fluorescent protein (GFP) 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; BAPTA, tetrapotassium salt; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; csTnC, chicken skeletal muscle troponin C. -based calcium indicators have been described so far: (i) ratiometric indicators (termed “cameleons”) consisting of a pair of fluorescent proteins engineered for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) which carry the calcium-binding protein calmodulin as well as a calmodulin target peptide sandwiched between the GFPs (2Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Google Scholar, 3Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2001; 8: 1069-1073Google Scholar); and (ii) various non-ratiometric indicators with calmodulin directly inserted into a single fluorescent protein (5Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Google Scholar, 6Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Google Scholar, 7Nakai J. Ohkura M.

However, calmodulin-based indicators show deficiencies in certain applications, e.g. they display only a reduced dynamic range in transgenic invertebrates compared with in vitro data of the purified indicator proteins and acute transfections (9Reiff D.F. Thiel P.R. Schuster C.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9399-9409Google Scholar, 10Kerr R. Lev-Ram V. Baird G.S. Vincent P. Tsien R.Y. Schafer W.R. Neuron. 2000; 26: 583-594Google Scholar, 11Fiala A. Spall T. Diegelmann S. Eisermann B. Sachse S. Devaud J.M. Buchner E. Galizia C.G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1877-1884Google Scholar) and fail to show calcium responses when targeted to certain sites within cells. No successful transgenic expression in mammals has been reported yet. Calmodulin is a ubiquitous signal protein in cell metabolism and thus under stringent regulation involving a plethora of calmodulin-binding proteins (12Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Google Scholar). It activates numerous kinases and phosphatases, modulates ion channels (13Saimi Y. Kung C. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 289-311Google Scholar), and is itself extensively phosphorylated by multiple protein serine/threonine kinases and protein tyrosine kinases (14Benaim G. Villalobo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3619-3725Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored ways of constructing new types of calcium probes with more specialized calcium-binding proteins that should be minimally influenced by the cellular regulatory protein network. Instead of calmodulin, we chose to try variants of troponin C (TnC), the calcium sensor in skeletal and cardiac muscle (15Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Google Scholar), and combinations of TnC and parts of its physiological binding partner troponin I (16Mercier P. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2902-2911Google Scholar) as linker proteins in ratiometric indicator types. Troponin C is a well characterized dumbbell-shaped calcium-binding protein with two globular domains connected by a central linker resembling calmodulin in its overall conformation (17Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Google Scholar). Here, we describe novel types of calcium probes that are based on troponin C and mutants of the green fluorescent protein and demonstrate their usefulness for dynamic imaging within live cells. Gene Construction—Full-length and truncated troponin C domains were obtained by PCR from the wild-type gene sequence of chicken skeletal muscle troponin C and the human cardiac muscle gene sequence in which the intrinsic SacI site was deleted by a silent mutation of the Glu135 codon (GAG → GAA). By using primers containing an SphI site at the 5′ end and a SacI site at the 3′ end, the troponin C DNA fragments were inserted between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and citrine in the bacterial expression vector pRSETB (Invitrogen). TnI fusions with TnC were created by inserting TnI DNA fragments carrying either an SphI site or an SacI site at both ends at the existing SphI or SacI sites in the indicator fusion constructs. To alter calcium affinities of single EF-hands of TN-L15, point mutations were introduced into the troponin C sequence by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer extension method (QuikChange, Stratagene). For protein expression in mammalian cells, an optimized Kozak consensus sequence (GCC GCC ACC ATG G) was introduced by PCR at the 5′ end of CFP; the entire indicator fragments obtained by BamHI/EcoRI restriction of the pRSETB constructs were then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Membrane targeting of TN-L15 was achieved by fusing the 20 amino acid sequence KLNPPDESGPGCMSCKCVLS of the c-Ha-Ras membrane-anchoring signal to the C terminus of citrine, resulting in the construct TN-L15-Ras. Alternatively, the N-terminal 20 amino acids of GAP-43 (the sequence MLCCMRRTKQVEKNDEDQKI) were used for membrane-targeting of indicators. Protein Expression, in Vitro Spectroscopy, and Titrations—Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified as described previously (5Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Google Scholar). In vitro fluorescence measurements were performed in a Cary Eclipse fluorometer (Varian) equipped with a stopped flow RX2000 rapid kinetics accessory unit for kinetic measurements (Applied Photophysics). Calcium titrations were done with premixed calcium buffers (calcium calibration kit with magnesium #1, calcium calibration kit #3 to which magnesium was added when necessary; Molecular Probes). Magnesium titrations were done in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and varying amounts of MgCl2. For measurements of dissociation kinetics, 6 μm purified protein in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm tetrapotassium salt (BAPTA), 1 mm free Mg2+, and 1 or 50 μm free Ca2+ (TN-L15 D107A: 50 μm or 300 μm free Ca2+) were mixed with 20 mm BAPTA (TN-L15 D107A: 35 mm BAPTA) in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7, 200 mm KCl, and 1 mm free Mg2+; mixing dead time was 8 ms. Identical dissociation constants were obtained independently of calcium concentration (data not shown). Samples were excited at 432 nm and emission was monitored at 528 nm. Data sets from at least five experiments were averaged, and rate constants were derived from mono-exponential curve fittings. Cell Culture and Imaging—HEK293 cells were transfected with Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) and imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 35M microscope with a charge-coupled device camera (CoolSnap, Roper Scientific). Hippocampal neurons were prepared from 17-day-old rat embryos, transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation 1-2 weeks after preparation, and imaged 1-3 days after transfection. The imaging setup was controlled by Metafluor version 4.6 software (Universal Imaging). For ratio imaging, a 440/20 excitation filter, a 455 dichroic long-pass mirror, and two emission filters (485/35 for CFP, 535/25 for citrine) operated in a filter wheel (Sutter Instruments) were used. Ratiometric Indicators with New Calcium-binding Moieties—It was not straightforward to generate new indicators using troponin C variants. First, fragments tested resulted in minimal calcium sensitivity. Therefore, we had to go through a series of optimizations in which individual amino acids at the linking sequences close to the GFPs had to be exchanged or deleted. Overall, more than 70 different constructs were made, and the proteins were purified and tested individually for their calcium sensitivity. All of our troponin fragments were sandwiched between CFP as donor and citrine (8Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Google Scholar) as acceptor fluorophore (Fig. 1). Calcium binding to troponin C leads to a conformational change in the protein, thereby enhancing the FRET from CFP to citrine. The ratio of acceptor to donor emission was used as a measure of the free ligand concentration. We first constructed a set of new indicators using the fast chicken skeletal muscle troponin C (csTnC) (18Reinach C.F. Karlsson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2371-2376Google Scholar). As first constructs with simple insertion of the full-length gene yielded an indicator of modest performance, we tested a series of mutations and deletions at the linker regions. After consecutively deleting 14 amino acids from the N terminus of csTnC, we arrived at TN-L15, an indicator that showed a 140% ratio change in cuvettes with no magnesium present. Insertion of the human cardiac troponin C between CFP and citrine resulted in an indicator of a maximally 120% ratio change (termed TN-humTnC). In contrast to TN-L15, further attempts to improve the performance of TN-humTnC by engineering only led to indicators of slightly worse performance. In addition to the full-length sequences of humcTnC and csTnC and versions thereof with truncations and modified linkers, shorter csTnC domains were engineered in which only specific structural elements of the protein were used individually, such as the N-terminal regulatory lobe (amino acids 1-90, termed TnC-N90) of TnC alone. In our efforts to construct potentially minimally perturbing indicators, we also tested whether the conformational change within individual EF-hand motifs of TnC would alone be sufficient to allow the construction of indicators with satisfying performance. Unfortunately, such constructs (termed TnC-EF1-4 for the individual EF hands of TnC) never exceeded ratio changes of 5-20%. Because TnI is known to form a complex with TnC in vivo, and because some of these interactions are modified by calcium (16Mercier P. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2902-2911Google Scholar), peptide sequences of csTnI considered to be responsible for binding to the N- and C-terminal csTnC domains were selected according to the literature (17Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Google Scholar). We hoped that such additional binding peptides could enhance FRET efficiency and the dynamic range of the indicators. This way, we created constructs in which either region 1-48 of TnI was fused to the C terminus of TnC, or regions 95-133 and 96-116 of TnI were fused to the N terminus of TnC. The fusions were connected either directly or were separated by the different spacer sequences GG, GSG, or GGSGG. Such constructs, however, never exceeded the dynamic range of the indicators without TnI sequences. A summary of basic constructs with modest to good performance as well as a basic evaluation of their function can be seen in Fig. 1. Among these constructs, the two with remarkable changes in their emission spectrum after addition of calcium, TN-L15 and TN-humTnC, were selected for further characterization, together with a series of mutants of TN-L15 in which individual calcium-binding sites were inactivated by exchange of single amino acids within the EF-hand motifs. Analogously to the related “cameleons,” more convenient names for laboratory use of these indicators could be “S-troponeon” (S for skeletal) for TN-L15 and “C-troponeon” (C for cardiac) for TN-humTnC. In Vitro Properties of TN-L15 and TN-humTnC—Next, we set out to investigate further the calcium-binding properties of the chosen constructs. Examples of the emission spectrum of TN-L15 and TN-humTnC at zero and saturating calcium levels are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. The C-terminal domain of TnC is known to have two high-affinity calcium-binding sites that also bind magnesium. The N-terminal lobe binds calcium specifically with a somewhat lower affinity (19Cheung H.C. Dong W.J. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy - Volume 6: Protein Fluorescence. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2000: 257-283Google Scholar). In agreement with this, addition of 1 mm magnesium reduced the maximal dynamic range of TN-L15 and TN-humTnC obtainable by the addition of calcium from 140 to 100% and 120 to 70%, respectively. Determination of Kd values for calcium was performed by Ca2+ titrations in the presence of 1 mm-free Mg2+. Calcium titrations resulted in response curves with apparent dissociation constants of 470 nm for TN-humcTnC and 1.2 μm for TN-L15 (Fig. 2C). Kds for magnesium binding were 2.2 mm and 0.5 mm for TN-L15 and TN-humTnC, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used extensively to study ligand-binding properties and conformational change within troponin C. Therefore, we inactivated individual EF-hands systematically by exchanging crucial aspartate or glutamate residues within the binding loops with either alanine or glutamine (20Sorensen M.M. da Silva A.C.R. Gouveia C.S. Sousa V.P. Oshima W. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9770-9777Google Scholar, 21Pearlstone J.R. Chandra M. Sorensen M.M. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35106-35115Google Scholar). The mutation D107A (20Sorensen M.M. da Silva A.C.R. Gouveia C.S. Sousa V.P. Oshima W. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9770-9777Google Scholar), by which the third, C-terminal EF-hand was inactivated within TN-L15, resulted in an indicator with reduced calcium affinity, in agreement with published results. The apparent calcium Kd of this construct was determined to be 29 μm. As a consequence, the response curve in calcium titrations was significantly shifted to the right (Fig. 2C). Therefore, this mutant seems to be more suitable for measuring larger changes in calcium that can be encountered, for example, when targeting indicators to synaptic sites or in close vicinity to channels. Magnesium binding to the D107A mutant was also significantly reduced to a Kd of 5 mm. Inactivation of both C-terminal binding sites of the TN-L15 construct by the double mutation D107A/D143A did not yield a functional protein in our hands. For comparison, however, inactivating both N-terminal sites by the double mutation E42Q/E78Q yielded a protein that left only the C-terminal high-affinity components intact, resulting in a Kd for calcium of 300 nm (Fig. 2C). As calcium binding to EF-hands is known to be pH-dependent, we also investigated to what extent pH changes affected the ratios obtained at zero calcium or calcium saturation. As expected, ratios were dependent upon pH (Fig. 2D). Ratios started to drop beginning below pH 6.8, thus reflecting the pH-properties of citrine and CFP (8Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Google Scholar). In the physiological range of cytosolic pH fluctuations between pH 6.8-7.3, the ratios were, however, remarkably stable. pH-dependent differences in calcium binding to TnC versus calmodulin were thus not observed. pH-resistance of our probes is a clear advantage over recent non-ratiometric probes based on calmodulin and a single GFP as fluorophore (5Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Google Scholar, 6Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Google Scholar, 7Nakai J. Ohkura M. Imoto K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 137-141Google Scholar, 8Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Google Scholar), as these probes are intrinsically sensitive to pH changes and, therefore, are artifact-prone even when expressed in the cytosol. We were also interested in the binding kinetics of the indicators. Binding of calcium to TnC, especially to the N-terminal sites, is considered to be diffusion limited (∼108m-1 s-1), with the corresponding conformational change occurring concomitantly or with a slight delay in cardiac troponin C (15Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Google Scholar). In our experience, on-rates of genetically encoded calcium probes seemed not to be a problem in experiments. However, slow off-rates are the main obstacle to follow fast changing signals. Therefore, we focused on measuring the dissociation rates of calcium bound to our indicator proteins. As expected, for first-order reaction kinetics, these rates were independent of the chosen calcium concentration. The τ values obtained from the three constructs were 860 ms for TN-L15, 580 ms for TN-L15 D107A, and 560 ms for TN-humTnC (Fig. 2E). In comparison with our proteins, yellow cameleon 2.3 displayed a τ value of 870 ms (Fig. 2E). Ca2+ Imaging in HEK293 Cells and Rat Hippocampal Neurons—Constructs of the indicators with optimized Kozak consensus sequences for initiation of translation were expressed in HEK293 cells. Troponin C is a part of the troponin complex and usually not expressed as an isolated protein within the cytosol. Therefore, it was satisfying to see that our indicators showed good cytosolic expression. Fluorescence was distributed evenly and homogenously within the cytosol with no signs of aggregation (Fig. 3, A and G). The nucleus was excluded as expected for proteins with molecular masses of 69.7 and 72.5 kDa, respectively, for TN-L15 and TN-humTnC. To examine the function of the indicators inside cells, we used the carbachol response of HEK293 cells that can be stimulated by means of muscarinic receptors. Responses of HEK293 cells expressing TN-L15 after stimulations with 100 μm carbachol can be seen in Fig. 3. Ratios (Fig. 3B) and intensity changes of the individual wavelengths (Fig. 3C) are depicted for two cells expressing different levels of the probe. In good agreement with the in vitro properties of the indicator, carbachol-induced oscillations of cellular-free calcium were readily imaged, with repeated cycles of reciprocal intensity changes of CFP and citrine. Imaging turned out to be dynamic and reproducible, and it was no problem to obtain Rmax and Rmin. TN-L15 was also functional in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. Spontaneous activity of hippocampal neurons was imaged using TN-L15, demonstrating its use in detecting endogenous activity patterns (Fig. 3, D and E). Responses to high potassium or glutamate stimulation were also readily detected (data not shown). A response of HEK293 cells expressing TN-humTnC is shown in Fig. 3F. Maximal ratio changes within cells were 100% for TN-L15 and 70% for TN-humTnC, in accordance with the in vitro values of the indicators. For comparison, the maximal ratio change obtainable with yellow chameleon 2.1 on our set-up was 70% (data not shown). Subcellular Targeting Properties of TN-L15—We next set out to evaluate the targeting properties of our new indicators within cells. In principle, one great potential of genetic probes is that they can be targeted to cellular organelles and microenvironments with the precision of molecular biology. Subsequently, we generated a series of subcellular targetings using TN-L15 and compared them to the otherwise analogous calmodulin-based cameleons. Constructs were made in the identical manner and differed only in the calcium-binding moiety. In all cases tested so far, TN-L15 retained activity whereas the corresponding calmodulin-based probes were significantly modified in dynamic range (data not shown and Fig. 4). One very attractive cellular site to us seemed to be the plasma membrane, as submembrane calcium domains play a crucial role in a series of biological phenomena ranging from secretion, ion channel modulation, to signal transduction, yet are beyond the resolution of conventional light microscopy. Apart from these immediate applications, membrane-targeting pathways are also often involved in other labelings such as localizing the indicator to pre- or postsynaptic structures or fusions to the pores of calcium channels. Although membrane targetings of the calmodulin-based indicators ratiometric perikams and yellow chameleons have been described before (22Pinton P. Tsuboi T. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43389-43398Google Scholar), we were not able to put them to use successfully, as in our hands, cameleons had lost calcium sensitivity when targeted to the membrane (Fig. 4), and perikams were not considered preferential for primary neurons, as these cells show substantial cytosolic pH-fluctuations after stimulation (24Chesler M. Kaila K. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 396-402Google Scholar). Our TnC-based indicators turned out to be superior under these conditions. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of membrane targeting of TN-L15 and yellow cameleons using several membrane-targeting sequences. All constructs were made in the identical manner and differed only in their calcium-binding moiety. In Fig. 4, A and B, the membrane targeting sequence of GAP43 was used. The 20 N-terminal amino acid residues of GAP43 were added in the identical manner to the N terminus of TN-L15 or YC2.1. The functionality of these constructs was tested in HEK293 cells. Imaging with GAP43-TN-L15 revealed long lasting calcium oscillations after stimulation with carbachol. As expected, the submembrane calcium oscillations in these cells were very similar to those seen with a cytosolic indicator. Finally, calibration with ionomycin/10 mm CaCl2 and ionomycin/20 μm EGTA to obtain Rmax and Rmin verified that the indicator had its full dynamic range and full functionality when targeted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A). In contrast, GAP43-YC2.1 performed poorly under identical conditions (Fig. 4B). No oscillations were detectable, and also, calibration with ionomycin indicated a reduced dynamic range, suggesting that the indicator had lost significant features of its calcium-binding properties on the pathway to membrane insertion. The trace shown is representative of seven experiments, none of which gave a response. Similar results were obtained by fusing the indicators to the presynaptic protein synaptobrevin (Fig. 4, C and D) and the C-terminal membrane targeting sequence of Ha-Ras (25Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, E-G). In the case of TN-L15-synaptobrevin, we saw a decrease of the dynamic range of the indicator, which we also found when expressing and purifying the protein from bacteria. Therefore, we attribute this fact mostly to sterical problems within the indicator protein. Interestingly, YC3.3Ras was fully calcium sensitive when purified from bacteria and tested in vitro, suggesting that the addition of the targeting sequence did not result in steric hindrance within this construct. YC3.3Ras also appeared to fold and target correctly as it showed similar membrane staining as TN-L15Ras in HEK293 cells, and both CFP and YFP were expressed and folded properly (data not shown). For evenly labeled membranes of hippocampal neurons, we used the membrane anchor sequence of c-Ha-Ras (25Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Google Scholar). Both in HEK293 cells and hippocampal neurons, clear and homogenous membrane labeling was evident (Figs. 4E and 5C). For imaging, we defined small regions following the contours of the membrane. We were interested in determining whether long lasting submembrane calcium domains could exist in primary neurons that are not in equilibrium with bulk cytosolic transients. Such domains were detected in the rat smooth muscle-derived cell line A7r5, in which global long lasting submembrane calcium domains were detected that reached peak values as high as 100 μm (26Marsault R. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 16: 1575-1581Google Scholar). Interestingly, also under resting conditions, submembrane calcium seemed to be elevated in these cells (26Marsault R. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 16: 1575-1581Google Scholar). In primary neurons, resting submembrane calcium levels were not found to be elevated (Fig. 5B). However, TN-L15-Ras came close to saturation after stimulation with high potassium (Fig. 5B). Therefore, we turned to using the low-affinity version TN-L15D107ARas which, with a Kd of 29 μm, seemed more suitable to quantify submembrane calcium rises in these cells and compare them to bulk cytosolic transients. Using this probe, glutamate or high potassium stimulation elicited average ratio changes of about 19% (n = 34) (Fig. 5D). The probe was not saturated, as calibration with ionomycin/10 mm calcium resulted in a further increase in ratio to the maximum obtainable with this probe. Average cytosolic calcium transients, however, were not significantly lower on this time scale (data not shown), suggesting that no permanent gradient in calcium concentration from the membrane toward the cytosol is maintained in these cells under these conditions. It will be interesting to address these questions further with improved temporal resolution. In this report, we characterize a novel type of ratiometric calcium indicator and demonstrate its use for dynamic imaging within live cells. These indicators work in targetings in which chameleons failed and should be more compatible with transgenic expression within whole organisms. Instead of calmodulin, we incorporated a specialized calcium-binding protein that has no other known function than regulating muscle contraction and thus should minimally interfere with cellular biochemistry. It was also fortuitous to obtain functional indicators without the need of additional binding peptides such as the calmodulin-binding peptide M13 from myosin light-chain kinase that is present in chameleons and other non-ratiometric indicators and that could, in principle, be bound by endogenous calmodulin when expressed within cells. Genetically encoded indicators have the great advantage that they can be targeted to sites of interest with the means of molecular biology. The success rate of obtaining functional targetings was, however, relatively low with existing calcium indicators. Successful functional targetings have, for example, been achieved to the endoplasmic reticulum (2Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Google Scholar), the nucleus (2Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Google Scholar), the Golgi (8Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Google Scholar), or mitochondria (6Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Google Scholar). Many potentially very interesting targetings have so far not been reported, but certainly not for the lack of trying: for example, fusing indicators to the diverse array of calcium channels to monitor free calcium directly at the channel pore, targeting probes to the active zone of presynaptic terminals, or simply using genetically encoded calcium probes as activity sensors to monitor activity at the level of individual synapses. We do not know at present what type of modification restricts the calcium sensitivity of the calmodulin moiety in many targetings. It could be post-translational modification such as phosphorylation on the pathway to membrane insertion, interaction with calmodulin-binding proteins that have distinct localization patterns within cells, or simply binding by endogenous calmodulin, which may be present at extremely high concentrations under the membrane and especially in the vicinity of channels and specialized areas such as synapses. TnC-based indicators thus may complement the existing calmodulin-based indicators, as they promise to have a higher success rate in obtaining functional targetings when calmodulin-based indicators fail. It remains to be seen whether transgenic expression of TnC-based probes, especially in mammals, also solves some of the problems that may arise from the use of the highly regulated calmodulin within indicator proteins. Human cardiac troponin C is also a direct drug target for calcium sensitizing agents that modulate the calcium-binding behavior of cardiac TnC and strengthen the contraction of the human heart (27Pollessello P. Ovaska M. Kaivola J. Tilgmann C. Lundström K. Kalkinnen N. Ulmanen I. Nissinen E. Taskinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28584-28590Google Scholar). TN-humTnC may thus also become useful to design simple in vitro assays to identify small chemical compounds or polypeptides of clinical interest that act as calcium-sensitizing agents, in particular, for certain clinical settings, such as congenital heart failure. Genetically encoded indicators have tremendous potential in several areas of the life sciences, ranging from high throughput screening to cell biology to neurophysiological applications. They offer a means to implant an indicator deeply inside mature living tissue and thus complement new microscopy techniques such as multiphoton microscopy that aim at noninvasive imaging of physiological processes. Transgenic expression of our TnC-based indicators may be used in such diverse areas as elucidating sites of drug action within whole tissues to monitoring neuronal activity within the intact brain. Such functional genetically encoded optical probes of neuronal activity are urgently needed in cellular as well as systems neuroscience. We thank Drs. L. B. Smillie, R. J. Solaro, and K. Hastings for providing cDNA coding for troponin subunits. N. Hillen and O. Zapata Hommer provided technical assistance."

This complex then regulates the formation of transport carriers in the TGN that traffic to the plasma membrane in non-polarized cells. Here we report specificity of different PKD isoforms in regulating protein trafficking from the TGN. Kinase-inactive forms of PKD1, PKD2 and PKD3 localize to the TGN in polarized and non-polarized cells.

https://openalex.org/W1986951078,"Mutations in the doublecortin (DCX) gene in human or targeted disruption of the cdk5 gene in mouse lead to similar cortical lamination defects in the developing brain. Here we show that Dcx is phosphorylated by Cdk5. Dcx phosphorylation is developmentally regulated and corresponds to the timing of expression of p35, the major activating subunit for Cdk5. Mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis indicate phosphorylation at Dcx residue Ser297. Phosphorylation of Dcx lowers its affinity to microtubules in vitro, reduces its effect on polymerization, and displaces it from microtubules in cultured neurons. Mutation of Ser297 blocks the effect of Dcx on migration in a fashion similar to pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5 activity. These results suggest that Dcx phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates its actions on migration through an effect on microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2094119136,"Doublecortin (Dcx) is a microtubule-associated protein that is mutated in X-linked lissencephaly (X-LIS), a neuronal migration disorder associated with epilepsy and mental retardation. Although Dcx can bind ubiquitously to microtubules in nonneuronal cells, Dcx is highly enriched in the leading processes of migrating neurons and the growth cone region of differentiating neurons. We present evidence that Dcx/microtubule interactions are negatively controlled by Protein Kinase A (PKA) and the MARK/PAR-1 family of protein kinases. In addition to a consensus MARK site, we identified a serine within a novel sequence that is crucial for the PKA- and MARK-dependent regulation of Dcx's microtubule binding activity in vitro. This serine is mutated in two families affected by X-LIS. Immunostaining neurons with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated substrates of MARK supports the conclusion that Dcx localization and function are regulated at the leading edge of migrating cells by a balance of kinase and phosphatase activity."

Although each of these conditions is also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction potentially mediated by proteasome inhibition, the relationship between proteasome inhibition and the loss of mitochondrial homeostasis in each of these conditions has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we conducted experimentation in order to begin to develop a more complete understanding of the effects proteasome inhibition has on neural mitochondrial homeostasis. Mitochondria within neural SH-SY5Y cells exposed to low level proteasome inhibition possessed similar morphological features and similar rates of electron transport chain activity under basal conditions as compared with untreated neural cultures of equal passage number. Despite such similarities, maximal complex I and complex II activities were dramatically reduced in neural cells subject to proteasome inhibition. Proteasome inhibition also increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, reduced intramitochondrial protein translation, and increased cellular dependence on glycolysis. Finally, whereas proteasome inhibition generated cells that consistently possessed mitochondria located in close proximity to lysosomes with mitochondria present in the cellular debris located within autophagosomes, increased levels of lipofuscin suggest that impairments in mitochondrial turnover may occur following proteasome inhibition. Taken together, these data demonstrate that proteasome inhibition dramatically alters specific aspects of neural mitochondrial homeostasis and alters lysosomal-mediated degradation of mitochondria with both of these alterations potentially contributing to aging and age-related disease in the nervous system.

The proteasome is a large multicatalytic protease that is responsible for the majority of overall intracellular protein degradation (1Goldberg A.L. Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Lee D.H. Rohrwild M.

Although increasing evidence suggests that proteasome inhibition plays a direct role in mediating neurodegenerative and neuropathological processes, at present the mechanism(s) responsible for inducing the neurotoxicity associated with proteasome inhibition has not been fully elucidated. To survive, cells must continually generate energy through either the mitochondria-dependent mechanisms or mitochondrial-independent mechanisms such as glycolysis. Within mitochondria, energy is produced as the result of electrons flowing down the electron transport system (ETS). 1The abbreviations used are: ETS, electron transport system; ROS, reactive oxygen species; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone; H2DCFDA, dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; CYTb, apocytochrome b; COI, COII, and COIII, subunits I, II, and III of cytochrome c oxidase; ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5 and ND6, subunits 1, 2, 3, 4, 4L, 5, and 6 of NADH dehydrogenase; A6 and A8, subunits 6 and 8 of the H+-ATPase. Impairments in ETS are associated with increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased energy production (16Albers D.S. Beal M.F. J. Neural Transm.

Interestingly, numerous neurodegenerative conditions associated with mitochondria dysfunction are also known to have significant levels of proteasome inhibition, thus raising the possibility that proteasome inhibition may play a direct role in inducing the observed mitochondrial dysfunction. However, at the present time, a direct role for proteasome inhibition mediating mitochondrial dysfunction in neural cells has not been reported. We have recently generated a clonal line of human SH-SY5Y cells that allows for the analysis of the cellular and molecular alterations that occur following low level proteasome inhibition (22Ding Q. Dimayuga E. Martin S. Bruce-Keller A.J. Nukala V. Cuervo A.M. Keller J.N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Ding Q. Bruce-Keller A.J. Chen Q. Keller J.N.

Med. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar) yet remain fully viable for multiple passages, thus allowing for neurochemical analysis to be conducted without the potentially confounding issues surrounding other models that possess rapid and widespread apoptotic cell death. In this study, we utilized this clonal line to determine the effects of low level proteasome inhibition on mitochondrial homeostasis. Together, these data demonstrate the ability of proteasome inhibition to directly alter multiple aspects of neural mitochondrial homeostasis and alter lysosomal-mediated degradation of mitochondria, demonstrating a possible role for proteasome inhibition serving as a direct mediator of neural mitochondrial dysfunction. Reagents—All of the cell culture medium, serum, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The MG-115 and ATP assay kit were purchased from Calbiochem, and all of the other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Establishment of Clonal Lines—Neural SH-SY5Y cells were obtained from the ATCC and propagated as described previously (22Ding Q. Dimayuga E. Martin S. Bruce-Keller A.J. Nukala V. Cuervo A.M.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1490-1498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To establish individual clonal lines following chronic exposure, neural SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in normal growth medium containing 100 nm MG115 with individual clones selected and characterized as described previously (22Ding Q. Dimayuga E. Martin S. Bruce-Keller A.J. Nukala V. Cuervo A.M. Keller J.N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Ding Q. Bruce-Keller A.J. Chen Q. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). The medium was replaced weekly, and fresh MG115 was added each week. Control cultures consisted of sister SH-SY5Y cells that were propagated alongside MG115-exposed cultures for the duration of the selection period. Cells of fewer than 25 passages were utilized for all of the described studies. Isolation of Mitochondria—All of the mitochondrial procedures were conducted using established methodologies that have been published by our group in previous studies (26Sullivan P.G. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. Scheff S.W. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 27Sullivan P.G. Dube C. Dorenbos K. Steward O. Baram T.Z. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). On each day of experimentation, semiconfluent cell cultures from 75-cm2 flasks were isolated using 0.25% trypsin with cells from at least six flasks pooled to generate a single sample of either wild type or clonal cells. Cells were utilized for mitochondrial assays immediately following their isolation with wild type and clonal lines analyzed side by side on the same day. Cells from at least five separate preparations obtained on 5 separate days were utilized to generate data in the present report. Following the addition of trypsin, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. All of the subsequent steps were preformed at on ice or at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was then resuspended in 0.5 ml of mitochondrial isolation buffer (215 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), and the plasma membranes were ruptured by nitrogen decompression (Parr Cell Disruption Bomb) at 1000 p.s.i. for 5 min as described previously (27Sullivan P.G. Dube C. Dorenbos K. Steward O. Baram T.Z. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The mitochondria were then purified by differential centrifugation at 1300 × g for 5 min to pellet unbroken cells and the nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria. The pellet was resuspended in EGTA-free isolation buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in EGTA-free isolation buffer at a concentration of ∼10 mg/ml. Analysis of Mitochondrial Respiration and ATP Levels—Mitochondrial respiration was assessed using a miniature Clark-type electrode in a sealed, thermostated, and continuously stirred chamber as described previously (26Sullivan P.G. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. Scheff S.W. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 27Sullivan P.G. Dube C. Dorenbos K. Steward O. Baram T.Z. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were added to the chamber to yield a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in respiration buffer (215 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm inorganic phosphates, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). State II respiration was initiated by the addition of pyruvate and malate. State III respiration was initiated by the addition of 150 nm ADP followed by the addition of oligomycin (1 μg/ml) to induce State IV respiration. The mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 1 μm) was added to the chamber to induce maximum State V respiration (complex I-driven). The complex I inhibitor rotenone (1 μm) was added to the chamber followed by the addition of succinate (10 mm) to allow for the quantification of State V complex II-driven respiration. Data are presented as nmolO2/min/mg mitochondrial protein. Cellular ATP levels were determined using a commercially available ATP assay kit (Calbiochem) according to manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species—Mitochondrial ROS production was assessed using the ROS indicator H2DCFDA as described previously (26Sullivan P.G. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. Scheff S.W. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 27Sullivan P.G. Dube C. Dorenbos K. Steward O. Baram T.Z. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). 50 μg of isolated mitochondria was incubated in a total volume of 100 μl of respiration buffer at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 10 μm H2DCFDA, which was made fresh before each use. The relative amounts of mitochondrial ROS produced were measured using a fluorometric plate reader (excitation 490 nm, emission 526 nm). Controls included the addition of FCCP to inhibit membrane potential-dependent ROS production (minimum ROS production) and oligomycin to maximize membrane potential (maximum ROS production). In each experiment, the mitochondrial-independent ROS production was accounted for by subtracting out the fluorescence intensity measured in control wells in which no mitochondria were added. All of the assays for mitochondrial experiments were run in replicates of 4–8/assay, and the mean data were used for analysis. Data are expressed as raw fluorescence units. Analysis of Mitochondrial Protein Levels—To analyze mitochondrial protein synthesis, pulse-labeling experiments with [35S]methionine were carried out as described previously (28Bai Y. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4848-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Samples of either control or clone 6 cells (2 × 106 cells) were plated onto 10-cm2 dishes, incubated overnight, and then washed with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium followed by a 7-min incubation at 37 °C in 4 ml of the same medium containing 50 μg/ml cytoplasmic translation inhibitor emetine. Thereafter, [35S]methionine (0.4 mCi/plate) was added and the cells were incubated for 1 h. To test the stability of the mitochondrial translation products, pulse-chase labeling experiments were performed. Cell plating and labeling were carried out as described above with the exception that emetine was replaced with cycloheximide, a reversible cytosolic protein synthesis inhibitor, and incubation time with [35S]methionine was extended to 2 h. After the labeling, the cells were washed and subjected to a 22-h chase period in complete and unlabeled medium in the absence of cycloheximide. The labeled cells were trypsinized, washed, and lysed in 1% SDS. Samples containing 50 μg of protein were electrophoresed through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15–20% exponential gradient). The intensities of the bands were quantified by phosphorimaging analysis. The ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5, and ND6 are subunits of NADH dehydrogenase; CYTb is apocytochrome b; COI, COII, and COIII are subunits of cytochrome c oxidase; and A6 and A8 are subunits of the H+-ATP synthase.

Following experimental treatment, cells were rinsed in ice-cold 0.1 m Sorenson's buffer (pH 7.4) followed by 30-min fixation in 3.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m Sorenson's solution (v/v) followed by a 30-min incubation in 1% osmium tetroxide. Cells were then subjected to dehydration via incubations in increasing concentrations of ethanol and embedded in Eponate 12 resin. The tissue was then sectioned (60 nm), placed into copper grids, and imaged using a Philips CM100 EM (Philips Electron Optics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Data was collected from at least 100 cells for each condition. Analysis of Neural Survival—Cell viability was determined by Hoechts 33258 staining as described previously (22Ding Q. Dimayuga E.

For each time point, at least eight cultures from two separate experiments were utilized with at least 200 cells counted for each time point. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test with a p value of < 0.05 required for significance. Clonal Cell Lines Exhibit Altered Mitochondrial Function—To determine the effects of prolonged low level proteasome inhibition on neural mitochondria homeostasis, we conducted studies using our recently developed clonal SH-SY5Y cell line (22Ding Q.

Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). These cells have been extensively characterized in previous studies (22Ding Q. Dimayuga E. Martin S. Bruce-Keller A.J. Nukala V. Cuervo A.M.

Med. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar) and to be a useful model for the analysis of the long term neurotoxicity associated with proteasome inhibition. Mitochondrial respiration is the most sensitive and reliable method available to measure mitochondrial bioenergetics; therefore, we assessed mitochondrial oxygen consumption in control and clonal cell populations of equal passage number. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, oxygen consumption driven by the NADH-linked substrates pyruvate and malate (complex I-driven) was not significantly different between control or clonal cells (clone 6) when measured in the presence of ADP (State III) or when the ATP synthase was inhibited (State IV; oligomycin present). However, when maximum respiration was assessed (State V; FCCP present), oxygen consumption was significantly reduced in the mitochondria isolated from the clone 6 cells (Fig. 1A). State V respiration was significantly reduced in clone 6-derived mitochondria regardless of the whether the mitochondria were utilizing complex I (Fig. 1A) or complex II (succinate) to drive respiration (Fig. 1B). Mitochondrial ROS production is a byproduct of mitochondrial respiration but can be dramatically increased in response to inefficient ETS function. Therefore, we next sought to determine whether the alterations in mitochondrial respiration, observed in the cells undergoing inhibition of proteasome activity, altered the amount of mitochondrial-derived ROS. Mitochondria isolated from clone 6 cells were observed to possess a significant increase in mitochondrial-derived ROS (21% increase) as compared with control cultures measured during State IV complex I-driven respiration (Fig. 2). Clonal Cells Possess Decreased Levels of Mitochondrial-derived Proteins of the Electron Transport Chain—In order for the electron transport chain to function properly, the mitochondria must produce 13 different mtDNA-encoded proteins (18Schon E.A. Manfredi G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 31Wei Y.H. Lu C.Y. Lee H.C. Pang C.Y. Ma Y.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 854: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 32Blass J.P. Sheu R.K. Cedarbaum J.M. Rev. Neurol. (Paris). 1988; 144: 543-563PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are transcribed and translated within the mitochondria and do not therefore require mitochondrial protein import. Seven of these proteins are identified as ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5, and ND6, which are subunits of NADH dehydrogenase. The mtDNA-encoded protein CYTb is also known as apocytochrome b, whereas COI, COII, and COIII are subunits of cytochrome c oxidase. The mtDNA-encoded proteins A6 and A8 are subunits of the H+-ATP synthase. To determine whether the loss of complex I and complex II activity in clone 6 cells may be due in part to alterations in the amount of mtDNA-encoded protein production, we conducted studies analyzing the synthesis and degradation of each of these mtDNA-encoded proteins. These pulse-chase studies were conducted using conditions that allowed for the selective analysis of intramitochondrial protein synthesis (28Bai Y. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4848-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and demonstrated the presence of 13 major protein bands that correspond to the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins in both the control and clonal cells (Fig. 3). The banding pattern and intensity in these gels were identical to previously published reports using this method (28Bai Y. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4848-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The overall mitochondrial protein synthesis was decreased by 64.8% in clone 6 cells (Fig. 3) as compared with control cells with all of the 13 proteins showing a dramatic decrease in expression. Interestingly, pulse-chase experiments revealed that the level of mtDNA-encoded protein was further decreased by 81.4% in clone 6 cells (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data indicate that chronic low level proteasome inhibition decreases the amount of mtDNA-encoded protein synthesis with proteins that are able to be translated within the mitochondria, exhibiting decreased stability. Neural Cells Undergoing Proteasome Inhibition Are More Dependent on Glycolysis—To maintain homeostasis, neural cells primarily rely on energy produced from either the mitochondria or the result of mitochondria-independent mechanisms such as glycolysis. Because no significant alteration in cellular ATP levels was observed between cultures of normal and clone 6 cells (data not shown), we sought to determine whether clone 6 cells maintained cellular energy levels through an increased dependence on glycolysis. In this set of experiments, neural cells were maintained in complete medium or switched to a glucose-free medium that contained serum and all of the other media components other than glucose. Normal cells that underwent cell death within 48 h of transfer to no glucose medium (Fig. 4) with clone 6 cells were observed to undergo significantly higher levels of cell death than control cells (Fig. 4). Cell death in this model was primarily associated with nuclear condensation and not with nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 4), suggesting that cell toxicity may be mediated by a necrotic and not an apoptotic pathway. It is important to point out that the increased levels of neural death in clone 6 cells occurs despite the fact that these cells are more resistant to both serum withdrawal-induced and hydrogen peroxide-induced neural death (22Ding Q. Dimayuga E. Martin S. Bruce-Keller A.J. Nukala V. Cuervo A.M. Keller J.N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Ding Q. Bruce-Keller A.J. Chen Q. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Neural Cells Undergoing Proteasome Inhibition Possess Morphologically Normal Mitochondria but Possess Evidence of Altered Mitochondrial Turnover—To determine whether the mitochondrial alterations observed in our clonal cells were simply because of alterations in mitochondrial integrity, we conducted studies using electron microscopy. In these studies we analyzed hundreds of individual cells and observed that proteasome inhibition did not alter the size or shape of mitochondria in clone 6 cells (Fig. 5) and was not associated with a loss or swelling of christae within mitochondria (Fig. 5). The mitochondria population in the control and clonal cell lines was essentially uniform with no significant alteration in the intracellular localization or number of mitochondria observed between the control and clonal cells (data not shown). Despite such similarities, it was consistently noted that the mitochondria of proteasome inhibitor-treated cells were nearly always located in close proximity to dense core lysosomes (Fig. 5). Because these lysosomes could be indicators of lysosomal-mediated degradation of mitochondria, we conducted more in depth analysis to determine whether direct evidence for an up-regulation in lysosomal-mediated degradation of mitochondria could be observed in cells undergoing proteasome inhibition. Although no evidence of lysosomal-mediated degradation of mitochondria was ever observed in our control cells (data not shown), our clonal cell lines were routinely observed to contain large autophagosomes (Fig. 6), indicative of increased lysosomal activation. Surprisingly, whole or even partial mitochondria (Fig. 6) could often be found in these autophagosome and lysosomal structures, thus demonstrating direct evidence for increased levels of lysosomal-mediated mitochondria turnover. Interestingly, clone 6 cells possessed significantly higher levels of lipofuscin (Fig. 7), an intracellular aggregate composed primarily of protein, lipids, and carbohydrates. Because lipofuscin is believed to be derived in part from the incomplete degradation of mitochondria (33Brunk U.T. Terman A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), these data may indicate that the ability of clone 6 cells to remove mitochondria by macroautophagy is somehow impaired or insufficient to remove damaged or unwanted mitochondria. Additionally, studies have suggested that lipofuscin may be a potent inhibitor of macroautophagy-mediated protei"

The carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a newly identified basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factor proposed to regulate the expression of the glucose-responsive gene pyruvate kinase. This gene contains a carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) consisting of two E box motifs separated by 5 bp that is necessary and sufficient for glucose regulation. We demonstrate that overexpression of ChREBP in primary rat hepatocytes activates other ChoRE-containing promoters in a manner consistent with their ability to respond to glucose. In vitro binding of ChREBP to ChoRE sequences was not detected. Because E box-binding proteins function as obligate dimers, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse liver cDNA library to identify potential heteromeric partners. Mlx (Max-like protein X) was selected as the only basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper interaction partner in this screen. When a plasmid expressing either Mlx or ChREBP was cotransfected with a ChoRE-containing reporter plasmid into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, no increase in promoter activity was observed. However, the expression of both proteins dramatically enhanced promoter activity. This activation was observed with reporters containing ChoREs from several different lipogenic enzyme genes. In contrast, reporters containing non-glucose-responsive E box elements were not activated by ChREBP-Mlx expression. In vitro binding of ChREBP to ChoRE-containing oligonucleotides was observed only in the presence of Mlx. ChREBP-Mlx binding discriminated between E box sites that are glucose-responsive and those that are not. We conclude that Mlx is a functional heteromeric partner of ChREBP in regulating the expression of glucose-responsive genes.

The synthesis of triglycerides in the liver is regulated by the nutrition of the animal. For example, when mammals are fed a high carbohydrate/low fat diet, increases in insulin and in glucose uptake and metabolism occur in response to elevated blood glucose levels. These changes are responsible for increasing the production of triglycerides in the liver. The increased production is due to modifications of both the concentration and activity of enzymes involved in the pathway of triglyceride synthesis (lipogenesis). The induction of lipogenic enzyme genes occurs primarily at the transcriptional level. Lipogenic mRNAs that are induced in response to high carbohydrate feeding include pyruvate kinase (PK), 1The abbreviations used are: PK, pyruvate kinase; bHLH/LZ, basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c; ChoRF, carbohydrate-responsive factor; ChoRE, carbohydrate response element; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element-binding protein; Mlx, Max-like protein X; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HA, hemagglutinin. fatty-acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, S14, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (for review, see Refs. 1Towle H.C.

However, we have provided evidence that SREBP-1c expression is not sufficient to account for the glucose/insulin induction of lipogenic enzyme genes in primary rat hepatocytes (15Stoeckman A.K.

Therefore, we proposed the existence of another factor, carbohydrate-responsive factor (ChoRF), that is responsible for the glucose induction of lipogenic enzyme genes. A sequence in the PK promoter has been identified for its ability to support a response to glucose (17Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

In the case of both the fatty-acid synthase and S14 genes, independent sites for the actions of insulin (SREBP-1c-binding site) and glucose (presumptive ChoRF-binding site) have been identified (16Koo S.-H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Rufo C. Teran-Garcia M. Makamura M. Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. Clarke S.D.

Recently, a transcription factor has emerged as a candidate for the ChoRF (25Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

A. 2003; 100: 5107-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This protein, carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), was purified based on its ability to bind the PK ChoRE in DNA affinity chromatography (25Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). ChREBP (also known as WBSCR14 and MondoB) is a member of the bHLH/LZ family of transcription factors that is known to recognize E box sequences in the promoters of target genes. ChREBP mRNA is present in mouse kidney, heart, and small intestine, but predominantly in the liver (25Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 28de Luis O. Valero M.C. Jurado L.A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When primary rat hepatocytes are transfected with a ChREBP expression vector, PK promoter activity is increased under high (but not low) glucose conditions (25Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether ChREBP can activate other lipogenic enzyme gene promoters and whether it binds to the regulatory sequences in these lipogenic genes. In this study, we present further evidence supporting the role of ChREBP in the induction of transcription in glucose-responsive promoters. In addition, we found that ChREBP does not act alone, but instead functions in a heteromeric complex with the bHLH/LZ transcription factor Mlx (Max-like protein X). Together, these two bHLH/LZ factors bind to and activate transcription in a number of lipogenic enzyme genes containing the ChoRE. Cloning of ChREBP—The full-length ChREBP-ζ isoform (Gen-Bank™/EBI accession number AF245475) was cloned by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR kit (Roche Applied Science), mouse liver cDNA as template, and primers with restriction enzyme tags (forward, 5′-GGAAGATCTATGGCGCGCGCGCTGGCGGATCT-3′; and reverse, 5′-GACAAGCTTGCTTGGAAACTTTCACCAGG-3′). ChREBP was cloned into the CMVS4 expression plasmid (29Uppaluri R. Towle H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the BglII/HindIII sites. Because of its instability in other strains, this plasmid was prepared in large scale using Escherichia coli Stbl2 cells (Invitrogen). The double mutant ChREBP was prepared by subcloning ChREBP into the pTZ18R vector (Promega) and mutating Ser196 and Thr666 to alanines using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and previously published primers (26Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Li Y. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The FLAG epitope tag was inserted at the 5′-end of both wild-type and double mutant ChREBPs in the pTZ18R vector using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (see Ref. 30Vassilev A.

After a 3-h attachment to 35-mm Primaria plates, cells were transiently transfected using F1 reagent (Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) in Williams' E medium containing 5.5 mm glucose, 23 mm HEPES, 0.01 μm dexamethasone, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 26 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1 unit/ml insulin. Plasmids were used at 2 μg of reporter and 500 ng of total expression vector (empty CMVS4 vector + expression vector containing the gene of interest) per 35-mm plate. After overnight transfection, cells were washed and cultured in the same medium containing either 5.5 or 27.5 mm glucose for 24 h. Hepatocytes were harvested using Promega reporter lysis buffer. Luciferase assays were performed using Promega luciferase assay substrate. Results of luciferase assays are expressed as relative light units/μg of protein. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. 293 Cell Culture and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. For reporter assays, cells were transfected in 35-mm dishes using Opti-MEM and LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (both from Invitrogen). Plasmids were used at 3.2 μg of reporter plasmid and 800 ng of expression vector (empty CMVS4 vector + expression vector containing the gene of interest) per 35-mm plate. After overnight transfection, cells were washed and cultured in Opti-MEM supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. 293 cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed as described above. To obtain whole cell extracts for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), 293 cells were transfected in 100-mm plates using the calcium phosphate method and 15 μg of expression vector/plate. For those 293 cells that were cotransfected with both ChREBP and Mlx, 15 μg of each vector was used. Briefly, the DNA was diluted into 450 μl of water, and 50 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2 was added dropwise. In a separate tube, air was bubbled through 500 μl of a HEPES-buffered saline solution (0.28 m NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, and 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.05) while the CaCl2/DNA mixture was added to it dropwise. This transfection mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then added to the 293 cells. The whole cell lysate was extracted from cells 40 h post-transfection using the “whole cell extract” protocol in the nuclear extract kit from ActiveMotif (Carlsbad, CA). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the Matchmaker Gal4 Two-Hybrid System 3 and a mouse liver cDNA library following the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). The library was made from 200 male BALB/c mouse livers (9-12 weeks old) and contained 3.5 × 106 independent clones in the pACT2 vector. Two mouse ChREBP bait plasmids were prepared: one with amino acids 632-763 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and the other with amino acids 632-868. Transformation-scale screens were conducted in yeast strain AH109 at either medium (-histidine) or high (-histidine and -adenine) stringency. Putative positive colonies were further streaked on -adenine/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl α-d-galactopyranoside plates to confirm interaction. Yeast plasmids were prepped using the Zymoprep yeast plasmid miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). To isolate the library plasmid (pACT2), yeast plasmid preparations were transformed into E. coli DH5α cells and selected on ampicillin plates. The cDNA contained in the library plasmid was sequenced using the Matchmaker 5′AD LD-Insert Screening Amplimer primer (Clontech). Cloning of Mlx Isoforms—Mlxγ was cloned into the CMVS4 expression vector using the Expand High Fidelity PCR kit, a yeast two-hybrid screen plasmid as template, and primers with BglII or SalI restriction enzyme tags, respectively (forward, 5′-CACAGATCTATGACGGAGCCGGGCGCCTC-3′; and reverse, 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCAGTAGAGTTGGTTTTTCAACTG-3′). Mlxβ was cloned by PCR using mouse cDNA and primers with BglII restriction enzyme tags (forward, 5′-CACAGATCTATGACGGAGCCGGGCGCCTC-3′; and reverse, 5′-GAAGATCTTCAGTAGAGTTGGTTTTTCAACTG-3′). A hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added to the CMVS4/Mlxγ vector using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. EMSAs—EMSAs were conducted as described previously (20Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical reaction contained 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide and 5 μg of whole cell extract from 293 cells. The nonspecific competitor used was 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Following incubation with oligonucleotide for 30 min at room temperature, samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Results were obtained from PhosphorImager analysis. For reactions with antibodies, proteins were preincubated with antibody for 30 min on ice before the 30-min room temperature incubation with oligonucleotide. Mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA-7 and mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (both from Sigma) were used. The catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was preincubated with cell extract for 15 min at room temperature before addition of oligonucleotide. Activation of Reporter Plasmids by ChREBP in Primary Rat Hepatocytes Correlates with Glucose Responsiveness—As mentioned in the Introduction, ChREBP has been shown to activate transcription in the PK promoter under high glucose conditions in rat hepatocytes (25Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the role of ChREBP in the glucose regulation of ChoRE-containing promoters, we cotransfected ChREBP along with reporter plasmids containing mutant ChoREs with changes in the spacing between the two E box motifs. In all naturally occurring ChoREs characterized to date, a spacing of 5 bp is found between the two critical E boxes (32Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutants with a spacing of 6 bp between the two E box motifs are substantially reduced in their glucose response, whereas mutants with a 4-bp separation do not respond to glucose (21Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). If ChREBP is the carbohydrate-responsive transcription factor, a correlation should exist between its ability to activate these mutant ChoREs and their ability to respond to glucose. Primary hepatocytes were cotransfected with the ChREBP expression vector and luciferase reporter plasmids containing the ChoRE spacing mutants and then cultured in low (5.5 mm) or high (27.5 mm) glucose. As predicted, overexpression of ChREBP did not affect the activity of any reporter construct under low glucose conditions (Fig. 1). In the presence of high glucose, ChREBP overexpression led to an increase (∼2-fold) in reporter activity in the construct with wild-type spacing (N5). ChREBP was able to slightly increase promoter activity above endogenous levels in the 6-bp spacing mutant (N6). However, addition of exogenous ChREBP did not increase promoter activity in the 4-bp spacing mutant (N4). Hence, ChREBP activation of these plasmids correlates with their ability to respond to glucose, further supporting the role of ChREBP in mediating the glucose response. Mlx Isoforms Interact with ChREBP in a Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—EMSAs were conducted with in vitro transcribed/translated ChREBP to evaluate its binding to ChoRE-containing oligonucleotides. Efforts to detect ChREBP binding to multiple ChoRE-containing oligonucleotides were unsuccessful. Because all known bHLH/LZ proteins bind to DNA as dimers or tetramers, this suggested that ChREBP may form a heteromeric complex with a distinct bHLH/LZ family member in the liver to act as the ChoRF. A yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out to identify potential liver heterodimeric partners for ChREBP. Using a mouse liver cDNA library and a fragment of ChREBP containing the bHLH/LZ domain as bait, 55 positive colonies were selected. Among these, Mlx was identified five times. Mlx is a bHLH/LZ family member of the Myc/Max/Mad subclass. Both Mlxβ and Mlxγ isoforms were represented in the positive clones. None of the other clones were found to be bHLH/LZ family members. Because the screen was performed for the purpose of identifying potential bHLH/LZ family partners, only Mlx was pursued in the following experiments. It remains to be seen whether the other ChREBP-interacting proteins are relevant to ChREBP function in vivo. ChREBP and Mlx Bind to the PK ChoRE as a Heteromeric Complex—To investigate ChREBP and Mlx binding to ChoRE-containing oligonucleotides, we used whole cell extracts from 293 cells that were transfected with expression plasmids for these proteins. When whole cell lysates from untransfected 293 cells were incubated with a radiolabeled PK ChoRE oligonucleotide in an EMSA, two complexes were observed (Fig. 2, lane 2). These complexes likely represent endogenous E box-binding proteins. Curiously, the more quickly migrating complex appeared to be variable in intensity in different preparations. When 293 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged Mlxγ expression vector alone (lane 5), no additional protein-DNA complexes were formed. Likewise, transfection of FLAG-tagged ChREBP led to no additional complex formation (lane 6). In contrast, extracts from cells cotransfected with both HA-tagged Mlxγ and FLAG-tagged ChREBP yielded a slower migrating complex (lane 8). This new complex was shifted with antibody to either the HA or FLAG tag (lanes 9 and 10), indicating the presence of both Mlx and ChREBP in the complex. Kawaguchi et al. (26Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Li Y. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) recently presented evidence that phosphorylation of ChREBP plays an important role in DNA binding. Protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of Ser196 represses nuclear translocation, whereas phosphorylation of Thr666 inhibits the ability of a recombinant C-terminal region of ChREBP to bind to an E box-containing oligonucleotide. Also, the expression of a double mutant of ChREBP (S196A/T666A) leads to increased PK promoter activity above wild-type ChREBP in primary rat hepatocytes treated with high glucose and cAMP. When this double mutant ChREBP was cotransfected with Mlx into 293 cells, the intensity of the newly formed complex was enhanced (Fig. 2, lane 11). This complex was also shifted with antibody to either the HA or FLAG tag (lanes 12 and 13). Immunoblotting with 293 cell extracts confirmed that the expression of FLAG-tagged wild-type ChREBP and FLAG-tagged double mutant ChREBP was comparable and that their expression did not affect HA-tagged Mlx expression (data not shown). To verify that the increased binding of the double mutant ChREBP was due to decreased phosphorylation and not to an adventitious change in conformation, we evaluated the effect of phosphatase treatment on ChREBP binding (lanes 14-19). Treatment of extracts from 293 cells transfected with wild-type ChREBP and Mlx with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A led to a progressive increase in binding to the ChoRE. This observation is consistent with the idea that wild-type ChREBP binding in 293 extracts is limited by an inhibitory phosphorylation event. Thus, formation of a protein complex on the PK ChoRE oligonucleotide requires the presence of both Mlx and ChREBP, and binding of ChREBP is inhibited by phosphorylation. Coexpression of ChREBP and Mlx Is Capable of Inducing Transcription of Glucose-responsive Sequences—To test whether the ChREBP-Mlx complex is capable of activating transcription, cotransfection experiments with ChoRE-containing reporter plasmids were carried out in primary hepatocytes. Cotransfection of ChREBP and Mlxγ expression vectors gave no increase in reporter activity above that seen with ChREBP alone (data not shown). It is possible that, in hepatocytes, Mlx is already at high levels and that further addition of Mlx cannot increase activity. For this reason, cotransfection experiments were conducted in 293 cells, a cell line that has no detectable Mlx protein (33Billin A.N. Eilers A.L. Queva C. Ayer D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36344-36350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 293 cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing two copies of the mut3/5 ChoRE linked to a basal promoter and an expression vector containing ChREBP and/or Mlx (β or γ). The mut3/5 ChoRE is derived from the rat S14 ChoRE and contains a degenerate E box (CAtGcG). It has previously been shown to support a strong response to glucose, but has decreased binding for the ubiquitously expressed upstream stimulatory factor and presumably other E box-binding proteins (31Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When 293 cells were transfected with an expression vector for either ChREBP or Mlx, no induction of reporter activity above basal levels was observed (Fig. 3). In contrast, when expression vectors for both ChREBP and Mlx were cotransfected, there was a dose-dependent increase in reporter activity up to 8-fold higher than basal levels. No major difference in reporter activity was observed between cells transfected with the β- or γ-isoform of Mlx. These data support an integral role for Mlx in the actions of ChREBP. Binding and Activation of ChoRE Spacing Mutants by ChREBP and Mlx Correlate with Functional Activity—To further evaluate whether ChREBP and Mlx function together in mediating the glucose response, an experiment was conducted with the panel of spacing mutant constructs described above. 293 cells were cotransfected with reporter plasmids containing the ChoRE spacing mutants and expression vectors containing ChREBP and Mlxγ. The 4-bp spacing mutant (N4), which did not respond to glucose, showed no increase in reporter activity above basal levels upon addition of ChREBP and Mlx (Fig. 4). The wild-type spacing plasmid (N5), which did respond to glucose, showed a 4-fold induction upon addition of ChREBP and Mlx expression vectors. Finally, the 6-bp spacing mutant (N6), which had previously shown an intermediate response to glucose, showed a 2-fold induction above basal levels when cotransfected with ChREBP and Mlx. Consequently, the activation of these spacing mutants by ChREBP and Mlx shows the same pattern in 293 cells as the glucose responsiveness of these sequences in hepatocytes. To investigate whether binding of ChREBP and Mlx correlates with activation, EMSAs were performed with oligonucleotides containing varied E box spacing (Fig. 5). For this experiment, both wild-type and double mutant ChREBPs, which showed enhanced binding to the PK ChoRE, were used. Lanes 1-6 show binding to the oligonucleotide with wild-type spacing (N5). As observed earlier, extracts from cells transfected with bo"
https://openalex.org/W2003994976,"Ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) plays an essential role in the maintenance of genome integrity and cell viability. The kinase is activated in response to DNA damage and initiates a checkpoint signaling cascade by phosphorylating a number of downstream substrates including Chk1. Unlike ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), which appears to be mainly activated by DNA double-strand breaks, ATR can be activated by a variety of DNA damaging agents. However, it is still unclear what triggers ATR activation in response to such diverse DNA lesions. One model proposes that ATR can directly recognize DNA lesions, while other recent data suggest that ATR is activated by a common single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediate generated during DNA repair. In this study, we show that UV lesions do not directly activate ATR in vivo. In addition, ssDNA lesions created during the repair of UV damage are also not sufficient to activate the ATR-dependent pathway. ATR activation is only observed in replicating cells indicating that replication stress is required to trigger the ATR-mediated checkpoint cascade in response to UV irradiation. Interestingly, H2AX appears to be required for the accumulation of ATR at stalled replication forks. Together our data suggest that ssDNA at arrested replication forks recruits ATR and initiates ATR-mediated phosphorylation of H2AX and Chk1. Phosphorylated H2AX might further facilitate ATR activation by stabilizing ATR at the sites of arrested replication forks.

In response to genotoxic stress, cells activate DNA damage checkpoints that induce cell cycle arrest.

(ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related), members of the phophatidylinositol 3-kinase superfamily, play a central role in regulating these DNA damage checkpoints in mammalian cells. Several findings showed that the two kinases act in distinct but partially overlapping pathways. While ATM appears to be activated mainly by ionizing radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks, ATR has been shown to regulate checkpoint responses after treatment of cells with a variety of DNA damaging agents including UV irradiation (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar, 2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Both proteins are able to bind DNA in vitro and are rapidly targeted to DNA in response to DNA damage. Moreover, ATR has been shown to bind with higher affinity to UV-damaged than to undamaged DNA (3Unsal-Kacmaz K. Makhov A.M. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6673-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ATM and ATR might be activated through interaction with DNA and DNA-associated checkpoint/repair proteins and act as DNA damage sensors (4Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 5Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25571-25575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, this direct sensing model was challenged by recent observations that ATM is activated by damage-induced rapid intermolecular autophopshorylation prior relocalization to sites of DNA breaks (8Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar, 9Kozlov S. Gueven N. Keating K. Ramsay J. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9309-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, instead of interaction with primary DNA lesions, ATR activation seems to require single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) coated with replication protein A. The recruitment of ATR to damage sites appears to be mediated by an ATR-interacting protein that forms a stable complex with the vast majority of ATR in human cells (10Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar). However, it is still remains to be determined whether ssDNA regions that arise during the repair of UV lesions or other DNA lesions are sufficient for ATR activation. Studies using a Xenopus cell-free system suggest a requirement for DNA replication in ATR activation (11Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but such a cell-free system might not support sufficient DNA repair. Moreover, a recent study describes UV-induced ATR activation in nonreplicating human cells (13O'Driscoll M. Ruiz-Perez V.L. Woods C.G. Jeggo P.A. Goodship J.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATR activation is independent of DNA replication. Given the essential role of ATR in genome maintenance (14Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), we investigated the activation of ATR in response to UV and CPT (camptothecin) treatment. Our results indicate that ssDNA lesions induced by the repair of UV lesions or CPT treatment are not sufficient to elicit detectable recruitment of ATR to chromatin in vivo or to induce ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1. ATR activation is only observed in the context of replication arrest, suggesting that ssDNA at stalled replication forks generate the signals required for ATR activation. Antibodies—The rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Chk1-S317 and anti-phopho-Chk1-S345 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling, and the monoclonal anti-Chk1 antibody (G4) was obtained from Santa Cruz. The goat anti-ATR (N-19) and rabbit-anti-ATR (Ab-2) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz and Oncogene, respectively. The monoclonal antibodies specific for BrdUrd (BrdUrd-FITC) and thymidine dimers were purchased from BD Biosciences and Karnya Biomedical Co., respectively, while monoclonal anti-6-4 photoproduct (6-4PP) antibody was generously provided by Dr. Tsukasa Matsunaka (Kanazawa University, Japan). Monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody AC15 was obtained from Sigma, and the mouse monoclonal anti-γ-H2AX antibody was raised against a C-terminal H2AX peptide phopshorylated at Ser139. Cell Lines—HeLa and U2OS cells were purchased from the ATCC. The XPC-deficient cells XP4PA were a generous gift from R. Legerski (University of Texas). The Hus1+ p21–/– and Hus1–/– p21–/– fibroblasts were generously provided by P. Leder and R. Weiss (Harvard Medical School, Boston). The H2AXflox/flox and H2AXΔ/Δ ES cells were a generous gift from F. Alt and C. Bassing (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston). UV and Drug Treatment—Cells were pulse-labeled with 25 μm BrdUrd for 1 h prior to UV irradiation (40 J/m2) or CPT (1 μm) treatment. For micropore UV irradiation, a 3-μm isopore polycarbonate filter (Millipore) was placed on top of the cell monolayer prior UV irradiation. The cells were fixed or harvested 30–45 min after treatment as indicated. FACS Analysis—HeLa cells were synchronized with a 20-h nocodazole block (1 μg/ml) followed by mitotic shake off and release into nocadazole-free culture medium. At various time points later, the cells were trypsinized and fixed with 70% EtOH overnight at –20 °C. After a PBS wash, the cells were incubated for 30 min with 10 μg/ml RNase A in citrate buffer and stained with 25 μg/ml propidium iodide for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Cell cycle analysis was done on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Immunofluorescent Staining—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde plus 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. In the case of ATR staining, fixation was preceded by a short detergent extraction step where the cells were incubated on ice for 5 min in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. For detection of incorporated BrdUrd or photolesions, fixed cells were denatured with 2 m HCl for 10 min at 37 °C followed by a PBS rinse to remove the HCl. The cells were blocked with 5% milk for 30 min at room temperature prior incubation with the primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk or 10% fetal calf serum + 0.1% Triton (ATR) at the following dilutions: cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and 6-4PP (1:100), BrdUrd-FITC (1:20), ATR (1:1000), Chk1-S317P (1:300), γ-H2AX (hybridoma supernatant). After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with secondary antibodies (FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:200, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:250, or rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG at 1:500 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and viewed with a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 fluorescence microscope. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in Frackelton buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm NaCL, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.1) supplemented with 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The samples (80 μg of protein) were diluted in SDS sample buffer and loaded on a 3–8% or 10% polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk for at least 30 min prior overnight incubation with anti-phospho-Chk1-S345 antibody (at 1:500 dilution) or anti-ATR (at 1:1000 dilution) at 4 °C. The blots were washed with a 1:1 dilution of TBST (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm, 0.2% Tween) and PBS, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies, and visualized by chemiluminscence using the Supersignal kit purchased from Pierce. For reblotting with anti-phopho-Chk1-S317 (at 1:500 dilution), anti-Chk1, and anti-actin (at 1:5000 dilutions each), the membrane was stripped with 7 m guanidine for 30 min. UV Lesions Are Not Directly Recognized by ATR—UV radiation produces two major classes of DNA lesions, the CPDs and 6-4PPs, which comprise 75 and 25% of the damage products, respectively. Both types of lesions distort the DNA helix and, if unrepaired, lead to DNA transcription and DNA replication arrest (15Sinha R.P. Hader D.P. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2002; 1: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). In humans, repair of these photolesions depend on the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, a multistep process that involves recognition of the lesion by the XPC-hHR23B complex, opening of the DNA helix around the lesion, dual incision followed by excision of ∼24–32 nucleotides, and gap-filling DNA synthesis (16Volker M. Mone M.J. Karmakar P. van Hoffen A. Schul W. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Driel R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). To test whether primary unprocessed UV lesions can activate ATR as suggested earlier (3Unsal-Kacmaz K. Makhov A.M. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6673-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we analyzed ATR chromatin binding and ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 (17Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) in UV-irradiated XPC-deficient cells that lack NER activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, UV-induced 6-4 photoproducts were equally detected in all of the UV-irradiated cells. In contrast, ATR retention and Chk1 phosphorylation were only observed in a subpopulation of these UV irradiated cells (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Since XPC-deficient cells are defective in the first step of NER, our findings suggest that primary UV lesions cannot directly initiate ATR activation in vivo. We next asked whether ssDNA generated during the normal repair of UV lesions could trigger ATR activation. We irradiated U2OS cells with 40 J/m2 UV and allowed the cells to recover and repair the UV lesions for 30 min at 37 °C. Previous reports had shown that XPG and ERCC1-XPF, the endonucleases involved in the NER incision reaction, are enriched at the sites of UV lesion within 15 min after UV radiation (16Volker M. Mone M.J. Karmakar P. van Hoffen A. Schul W. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Driel R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, binding of ATR to chromatin as well as phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser317 were confined to a subpopulation of UV-irradiated cells, resulting in a staining pattern similar to that observed in NER-deficient XPC cells. In the cells that did show ATR retention, this retention was restricted to sites of UV lesions as assessed by local UV irradiation through a 3-μm isopore polycaronate filter (Fig. 1B). Together these results indicate that neither unprocessed UV lesions nor ssDNA generated in the context of UV repair are sufficient to provoke ATR activation. ATR Activation in Response to UV and CPT Treatment Requires Replication Stress—ATR is known to be activated in response to replication stress (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar, 2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). To examine whether induction of replication stress is the critical step in UV-induced ATR activation, we pulse-labeled U2OS and XPC-deficient cells with BrdUrd prior UV irradiation. Co-staining with anti-phospho-Chk1 and anti-BrdUrd antibodies revealed that ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 is restricted to S phase cells (Fig. 2). To further assess the role of replication in ATR activation, we synchronized HeLa cells in the G1 and S phase using nocodazole block and subsequent release of cells from mitosis. The synchronized G1 or S phase cells were either mock-treated or exposed to UV irradiation or CPT treatment. CPT is a specific topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor that traps topo I in a covalent enzyme-DNA complex and blocks religation of the topo I-created DNA nicks (19Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). While all S phase cells showed strong recruitment of ATR to chromatin in response to UV or CPT treatment, no chromatin binding was observed in G1 phase cells (Fig. 3A). Likewise, ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser317 and Ser345 was confined to S-phase cells (Figs. 3B and 4, B and C). Since ATR as well as Chk1 protein level are not overtly reduced in G1 compared with S phase cells (Fig. 4B), our findings strongly suggest that replication stress is the major signal for ATR activation.Fig. 4The restriction of Chk1 phosphorylation to S phase cells is not due to altered ATR or Chk1 protein levels. A, HeLa cells were synchronized with nocodazole block followed by mitotic shake off. 8 h (G1) and 12 h (S) later, synchronized as well as asynchronous growing cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed on a flow cytometer. B, whole cell extracts from HeLa cells synchronized and treated as described in the legend to Fig. 3 were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-ATR or anti-Chk1-S345P antibodies. The anti-Chk1-S345 blot was subsequently stripped and reblotted with anti-Chk1 and anti-actin antibodies to demonstrate the equal levels of Chk1 and actin (loading control) in these samples. C, HeLa extracts treated with UV or CPT were immunoblotted with anti-Chk1-S345P, anti-Chk1-S317P, anti-Chk1, or anti-actin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) H2AX Is Required for ATR Accumulation but Not Chk1 Phosphorylation—We had described earlier that histone H2AX is phosphorylated by ATR in response to HU (hydroxyurea) or UV treatment (20Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of H2AX in response to ionizing radiation has been shown to be critical for the accumulation of various DNA damage response proteins at sites of DNA lesions (21Bassing C.H.

To determine whether H2AX is required for the chromatin association of ATR and/or Chk1 activation, we compared UV-induced ATR retention and Chk1 phosphorylation in H2AXflox/flox and H2AX–/– cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, ATR accumulation at sites of replication fork arrest was severely affected in the absence of H2AX, while ATR protein levels were similar in H2AXflox/flox and H2AX–/– cells (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly, phosphorylation of Chk1 appeared to be similar in UV-irradiated H2AXflox/flox and H2AX–/– cells (Fig. 5, B and C) suggesting that, as described previously for other DNA damage response proteins (22Celeste A. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Kruhlak M.J. Pilch D.R. Staudt D.W. Lee A. Bonner R.F. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), H2AX is required for the accumulation but not initial recruitment of ATR to chromatin following replication stress. Interestingly, recent data imply that the kinase activity of ATR regulates its translocation to sites of DNA damage (26Barr S.M. Leung C.G. Chang E.E. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1047-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that ATR-dependent phosphorylation of H2AX supports ATR retention at sites of replication stress and might contribute to cellular responses following replication stress. Together our results indicate that ssDNA formed either during the repair of UV lesions or introduced by drug treatment is not sufficient to initiate relocalization of ATR to chromatin and to trigger the checkpoint signaling cascade. ATR activation in response to UV irradiation is only observed in the context of replication arrest. It is possible that only ssDNA generated at the stalled replication fork is of sufficient length to recruit ATR in response to UV or CPT treatment. In vitro data suggest that the binding of ATR-interacting protein to replication protein A-coated ssDNA is length-dependent with a threshold length between 50 and 75 nucleotides (10Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar). Notably, repair of UV lesions by NER usually involves the excision of ∼24–32 nucleotides (27Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that normal NER repair would generate sufficient ssDNA to activate ATR pathway. Of course, our data do not rule out that ATR might be activated in some specific situation (for example, nonreplicating cells) if the repair process would create ssDNA intermediates of appropriate length.

https://openalex.org/W2033522647,"Olfaction is a principal sensory modality in rodents, and rats quickly learn to discriminate between odors and to associate odor with reward. Here we show that such olfactory discrimination (OD) learning consists of two phases with distinct cellular mechanisms: an initial NMDAR-sensitive phase in which the animals acquire a successful behavioral strategy (rule learning), followed by an NMDAR-insensitive phase in which the animals learn to distinguish between individual odors (pair learning). Rule learning regulates the composition of synaptic NMDARs in the piriform cortex, resulting in receptors with a higher complement of the NR2a subunit protein relative to NR2b. Rule learning also reduces long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation of the intracortical axons in slices of piriform cortex. As NR2a-containing NMDARs mediate shorter excitatory postsynaptic currents than those containing NR2b, we suggest that learning-induced regulation of NMDAR composition constrains subsequent synaptic plasticity, thereby maintaining the memory encoded by experience."
https://openalex.org/W2028453264,"The mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR) includes two major branches: one(s) specific to ER stress (Ire1/XBP-1 and ATF6-dependent), and one(s) shared by other cellular stresses (PERK/eIF-2α phosphorylation-dependent). Here, we demonstrate that the ER-localized protein Herp represents a second target, in addition to CHOP, that is dually regulated by both the shared and the ER stress-specific branches during UPR activation. For the first time, we are able to assess the contribution of each branch of the UPR in the induction of these targets. We demonstrate that activation of the shared branch of the UPR alone was sufficient to induce Herp and CHOP. ATF4 was not required during ER stress when both branches were used but did contribute significantly to their induction. Conversely, stresses that activated only the shared branch of the UPR were completely dependent on ATF4 for CHOP and Herp induction. Thus, the shared and the ER stress-specific branches of the UPR diverge to regulate two groups of targets, one that is ATF6 and Ire1/XBP-1-dependent, which includes BiP and XBP-1, and another that is eIF-2α kinase-dependent, which includes ATF4 and GADD34. The two branches also converge to maximally up-regulate targets like Herp and CHOP. Finally, our studies reveal that a PERK-dependent target other than ATF4 is contributing to the cross-talk between the two branches of the UPR that has previously been demonstrated. The mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR) includes two major branches: one(s) specific to ER stress (Ire1/XBP-1 and ATF6-dependent), and one(s) shared by other cellular stresses (PERK/eIF-2α phosphorylation-dependent).

Proximal transducers of the mammalian UPR, which include PERK, Ire1, and ATF6, are all ER-localized transmembrane proteins (1Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Google Scholar, 2Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Google Scholar, 3Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Google Scholar). They are kept in an inactive monomeric state under nonstressed conditions by binding to the ER chaperone BiP (GRP78). During ER stress, malfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, and BiP is dissociated from the luminal domains of these sensor proteins, leading to their activation (6Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Google Scholar, 7Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Google Scholar). For ATF6, dissociation from BiP allows its translocation to the Golgi, where its cytosolic domain encoding a transcription factor, is cleaved by the site 1 (S1P) and site 2 (S2P) proteases (8Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Google Scholar). The liberated ATF6 then migrates to the nucleus, where it directly binds to and activates the consensus ER stress response element (ERSE) found in the promoters of various UPR targets including transcription factors XBP-1 and CHOP, and ER chaperones like BiP and GRP94 (9Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Google Scholar, 10Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Google Scholar). For Ire1p, dissociation from BiP leads to its dimerization and activation of the cytosolic kinase domain, which in turns stimulates an endoribonuclease activity located at its C terminus. Activated Ire1 recognizes and cleaves two specific stem loop sequences in the XBP-1 mRNA, which are then religated, resulting in a larger XBP-1 protein (spXBP-1) due to a resulting frameshift (11Calfon M.

Spliced XBP-1 encodes a transcription factor that binds and transactivates the same ERSE site in vitro as ATF6 (13Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Google Scholar). However, recent data suggest that not all ATF6 and XBP-1 targets are shared (14Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Google Scholar, 15Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Google Scholar). In the case of PERK, BiP dissociation during UPR activation leads to oligomerization and activation of its cytosolic kinase domain. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF-2α, leading to an immediate, yet transient protein synthesis inhibition (16Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Google Scholar). Unlike ATF6 and Ire1 activation, which are specific to ER stress, the downstream consequences of PERK activation are shared with other cellular stress responses including amino acid deprivation, infection with double-stranded RNA viruses, heme deficiency and oxidative stress (16Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Google Scholar, 17Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Google Scholar, 18de Haro C. Mendez R. Santoyo J.

These cellular stresses all activate specific eIF-2α kinases that also cause a transient protein synthesis inhibition. Paradoxically, any condition that causes eIF-2α phosphorylation and the resulting protein synthesis inhibition, will induce ATF4 at the translational level (16Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Google Scholar), leading to activation of its downstream targets (22Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Google Scholar, 23Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34864-34873Google Scholar). Therefore, the mammalian ER stress response can be divided into two main branches: one that is downstream of both ATF6 and Ire1p/XBP-1 and is specific to ER stress, and another that is downstream of PERK and is shared by other cellular stresses that activate eIF-2α kinases (24Okada T. Yoshida H. Akazawa R. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 585-594Google Scholar). The C/EBP homologous transcription factor CHOP (GADD153) is the only UPR target that has been shown to be dually regulated by both the ER stress-specific and the shared branches of the UPR (10Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Google Scholar, 22Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol.

The CHOP promoter contains both an ERSE and a C/EBP-ATF composite site, through which these two branches act. Deletion of either element from a CHOP promoter construct leads to a decrease in its transcriptional activity (22Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Google Scholar). The ATF6 and XBP-1 transcription factors can bind to ERSEs in vitro, as demonstrated by gel shift assays (13Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Google Scholar), and ATF6 overexpression leads to CHOP induction in cells (10Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Google Scholar). The ATF4 transcription factor binds to the C/EBP-ATF composite site in vitro in an ER stress-dependent manner (22Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Google Scholar). However, the relative contributions of these two branches in regulating CHOP during different cellular stresses have not been determined. In PERK-null and eIF-2αS51A knock-in cells, where eIF-2α phosphorylation is blocked during ER stress, the induction of CHOP and XBP-1 is completely lost and the up-regulation of BiP is reduced (11Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Google Scholar, 16Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol.

These data support the existence of a cross-talk between the two pathways, where a PERK-dependent target is facilitating the activation of the ATF6 and Ire1/XBP-1-dependent branches of the UPR. Even though the molecular pathway for this cross-talk has not been established, ATF4 was implicated, as it is the only known direct target of eIF-2α phosphorylation during ER stress. Here, we identified Herp, an ER localized protein with an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (27Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Google Scholar, 28van Laar T. Schouten T. Hoogervorst E. van Eck M. van der Eb A.J. Terleth C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 123-131Google Scholar), to be another UPR target that is dually regulated by both the shared and the ER stress specific branches of the UPR pathway. Using ATF4-null MEFs, we analyzed the relative contributions of the different pathways in controlling CHOP and Herp transcription during ER and other cellular stresses. Our data reveal that although the ATF4-dependent pathway is not required for the induction of these genes during UPR activation, it is essential in response to cellular stresses that activate only the shared branch of the UPR. Furthermore, our data excluded ATF4 as the molecule that is responsible for the cross-talk between the shared and ER stress-specific branches of the UPR. In toto, our results enable us to separate UPR targets into three sets (Fig. 7), those that are specific to the UPR and evidently downstream of ATF6 and Ire1/XBP-1, those that are downstream of PERK and are shared by other cellular stresses, and those that are dually regulated by both pathways. The latter group is likely to be induced by all cellular stresses involving activation of an eIF-2α kinase with maximal levels of induction occuring during UPR activation. DNA Constructs and Chloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase (CAT) Assay—-894 to +35 bp of the mouse Herp promoter was cloned immediately upstream of the CAT reporter gene via a PCR-based method (22Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Google Scholar) using primer pair 5′-CTCTCCTATCACCTCTCTGAC and 5′-CTGCGTCGCTGGCGGCTC. The C/EBP-ATF composite site (-183 to -176bp) was deleted in the mutant promoter construct. 1 μg of the wild-type or mutant Herp promoter construct was transfected into COS-1 cells, and cell lysates were analyzed for CAT activity as detailed previously (22Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Google Scholar). Each experimental group was analyzed in triplicate, normalized against protein concentration, and the experiment was repeated twice. The error bars shown in Fig. 2A represent the standard deviations for each set of triplicates. A wild-type eIF-2α cDNA clone was kindly provided by Dr. John W. B. Hershey (University of California, Davis). A point mutant mimicking the phosphorylated form of eIF-2α (S51D), therefore constitutively blocking protein translation, was made with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced before subcloning both constructs into the pCMV5 vector. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Stress Induction—Primary wild-type and ATF4-/- MEFs were harvested and propagated in tissue culture as described (23Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34864-34873Google Scholar). Passage 5 through 7 MEFs were plated and left untreated (control), treated with thapsigargin (Tg, 1 μm), or cultured in media that lacked leucine (amino acid deprivation) for the indicated periods of time. Components of the leucine-free media are based on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media (cat. no. 11960), except that leucine is omitted. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 5 ml/liter Fungizone (Mediatech, Herdon, VA). 293T cells were transfected with the indicated vectors using the calcium precipitation method, and cell lysates were harvested 24 h later as described. Isolation of Cytosolic mRNA, Northern Blotting, and Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Cytoplasmic mRNA was harvested from wild-type and ATF4-/- MEFs, and 293T cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Valencia, CA). 20 μg of cytoplasmic mRNA from each experimental group was electrophoresed, analyzed by Northern blotting as described (29Brewer J.W. Cleveland J.L. Hendershot L.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7207-7216Google Scholar). The human GAPDH probe was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The hamster BiP and mouse ATF4 probes were prepared as described (23Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34864-34873Google Scholar). The mouse CHOP probe was amplified with the primer pair 5′-GGGAGCTGGAAGCCTGGTAT and 5′-TGCAGGGTCACATGCTTGGC, and the human Herp probe was produced using the primer pair 5′-CCAAGGCCTGGGGCCTGG and 5′-CTGTCGAGTCCACGCCAGG. Total XBP-1 mRNA was detected with a mouse probe amplified with the primer pair 5′-CGGCCTTGTGGTTGAGAACC and 5′-ACGAAAGAGACAGGCCTATGC. Where indicated, the 32P signals were quantified with Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager (Amersham Biosciences). To quantitate specific mRNAs by RT-PCR, 1 μg of RNA was used to first generate 50 μl of cDNA using a poly(dT) primer (1 mm). Semiquantitative PCR was performed with the Failsafe PCR system (Epicenter, Madison, WI) using 2 μl of cDNA and [α-32P]dCTP (23Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34864-34873Google Scholar). The labeled PCR products were separated on a 4% TBE-acrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to film. Quantitative data was obtained using a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimager and was normalized to the level of the γ-actin transcript measured from the same sample. The linear range was monitored by using serial dilutions (1:5 and 1:25) of the sample that showed the highest radioactive signal in each experimental group. The primer pair for mouse γ-actin was: 5′-CCGACGGGCAGGTGATCAC and 5′-GAGCAGTTAACTTGAATACAAGG, and for the mouse spXBP-1, 5′-GCTGAGTCCGCAGCAGGTG and 5′-ACGAAAGAGACAGGCCTATGC were used. Western Blot—For direct Western blotting, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysing buffer and proteins were electrophoresed under reducing conditions, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the indicated primary antibodies: rabbit anti-BiP and anti-CHOP (22Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Google Scholar), rabbit anti-ATF4 and goat anti-Hsc70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and monoclonal mouse anti-pan eIF-2α (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Wild type or ATF4-null MEFs were treated with Tg (1 μm) for the indicated times, harvested, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice before nuclear extracts were prepared (22Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Google Scholar). The EMSA reaction was performed with the appropriate [γ-32P]ATP-labeled probe (10,000 cpm) as introduced before (22Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Google Scholar). When indicated, 2 μg of a supershift antibody (polyclonal anti-ATF4 antisera, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction. The complimentary strands of the oligonucleotide probes were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The 29-bp CHOP C/EBP-ATF composite site probes (both wild type and mutant) were synthesized as before (22Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Google Scholar). Similarly, a 29-bp wild-type sequence containing -191 bp to -167 bp of the human Herp promoter (5′-GATACGCGGCGGGTTGCATCAGCCCGTGA) was synthesized and labeled. For the mutant Herp oligonucleotides, the underlined sequence of the wild-type probe containing the ATF site was altered to ccgtCtctAc. Identification of a Conserved C/EBP-ATF Composite Site in the Herp Promoter—To determine if the regulation of CHOP was unique among UPR targets, we searched the promoters of other genes up-regulated during ER stress for elements that might suggest they were also dually regulated. We identified the presence of a potential C/EBP-ATF composite site in the promoter of an ER-localized protein, Herp (Fig. 1). This site is located just upstream of the ERSE I and II sites that were previously characterized in the Herp promoter (28van Laar T. Schouten T. Hoogervorst E. van Eck M. van der Eb A.J. Terleth C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 123-131Google Scholar, 30Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9199-9205Google Scholar) and is completely conserved between the human and mouse genes. To determine if the C/EBP-ATF composite site contributed to the transcriptional up-regulation of Herp during ER stress, we isolated a 930-bp fragment of the murine Herp promoter containing ERSE I, ERSE II, and the potential C/EBP-ATF composite sites and tethered it to a CAT reporter. The wild-type promoter showed low basal activity and was induced ∼12-fold when the cells were treated with UPR inducing agents, demonstrating that this DNA fragment contained the necessary elements for responding to ER stress. Mutation of the composite site alone in the context of the murine Herp promoter construct did not dramatically alter the basal level of transcription but did significantly decrease its transcriptional activity after ER stress (Fig. 2A). To determine if ATF4 could bind directly to the Herp C/EBP-ATF composite site upon UPR activation, we synthesized wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides encompassing the composite site and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with nuclear extracts harvested from both wild-type and ATF4-null primary MEFs that were left untreated or incubated with thapsigargin to induce ER stress (Fig. 2B). Oligonucleotides encompassing the CHOP composite site, which are the same length as those synthesized for Herp, were used as a positive control. As expected, ATF4 bound to the CHOP probe in an ER stress-dependent manner when nuclear extracts from wild-type MEFs were used (Fig. 2B, lane 3) and could be supershifted with an antiserum to ATF4 (lane 4). When the Herp probe was similarly analyzed, we observed a complex (a) that co-migrated with the one that bound to the CHOP probe. Although trace amounts of this complex formed in the absence of ER stress (lane 5), the signal dramatically increased after ER stress (lane 7), and in both cases it was supershifted with the ATF4 antibody (lanes 6 and 8). A fainter, faster migrating complex (*), which also contained ATF4 binding activity, was observed with the Herp (lanes 7 and 8), but not the CHOP probe. This difference could either be due to the fainter signal obtained with the CHOP probe, or it is possible that it is specific to Herp. When nuclear extracts harvested from ATF4-null MEFs were used in the gel shift reactions (lanes 9–16), no binding activity was detected with either probe that could be supershifted with the ATF4 antibody, further demonstrating that the binding activity detected in the wild-type nuclear extracts was dependent on the presence of ATF4. Hence, we conclude that Herp, like CHOP, represents another UPR target that is dually regulated by both the shared cellular stress response and the UPR-specific pathways during ER stress. eIF-2α Phosphorylation Alone Was Sufficient to Induce Herp and CHOP, but Not BiP—To further determine if Herp was a direct target of the PERK/eIF-2α/ATF4-dependent pathway and could be induced independent of ATF6 and XBP-1 activation, we transfected cells with GFP, wild-type eIF-2α, or the eIF-2αS51D mutant, which conformationally and functionally imitates the phosphorylated form of eIF-2α and as a result inhibits protein synthesis (31Choi S.Y. Scherer B.J. Schnier J. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 286-293Google Scholar). Cells expressing GFP alone served as a control for basal and stress-induced expression of UPR targets (Fig. 3). The transfection itself did not induce ER stress, and the cells were still capable of inducing UPR targets like ATF4 and CHOP when treated with thapsigargin (Fig. 3, A and B). When cells transfected with the eIF-2α constructs were similarly examined, we found that expression of the constitutively active eIF-2α S51D mutant led to the robust induction of ATF4 and CHOP proteins, whereas expression of the wild-type eIF-2α construct caused only a very slight induction of these targets. To more closely examine the induction of UPR targets, mRNA was harvested from these cells and Northern blot analyses were performed (Fig. 3B). In keeping with the Western blot data, expression of the eIF-2α S51D mutant, but not the wild-type eIF-2α construct, resulted in Herp and CHOP induction, although to a level significantly lower than that obtained with thapsigargin treatment. Transcription of BiP, another UPR target, was not significantly altered by either wild-type or mutant eIF-2α expression, demonstrating that the ATF6 and Ire1/XBP-1 arms of the UPR were not affected. ATF4 Was Not Essential for Herp and CHOP Induction during ER Stress, but Was Required for Their Optimal Activation—We wished to measure the relative contribution of the ER-specific and the shared UPR pathways in the induction of both Herp and CHOP. First, we compared the mRNA levels of these two genes in the wild-type and ATF4-null cells during UPR activation, where both the shared (PERK-dependent) and the ER stress-specific (ATF6 and XBP-1-dependent) arms are activated. The thapsigargin-mediated induction of both CHOP and Herp transcripts in ATF4-null cells was reduced to ∼35% of that observed in wild-type cells, but was still very much apparent (Fig. 4A). The accumulation of CHOP protein in response to ER stress was also decreased in the ATF4-null cells, but could still be easily detected (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that although ATF4 clearly contributes to the transcription of these two genes during UPR activation, it is not completely essential. This result is different from a previous Western blot study where CHOP protein induction during ER stress was completely abolished in their ATF4-null MEFs (32Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Google Scholar). The phenotypes of the two ATF4-null mice are very similar with both showing lens development defect and with the majority of homozygotes dying between E14.5 and birth (our ATF4-/- mice birth rate: 6.5% versus Dr. J. M. Leiden, 7.5%) (23Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34864-34873Google Scholar, 33Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Sugihara A. Maekawa A. Terada N. Yoshida N. Akira S.

Combined with the facts that in our ATF4-/- MEFs, 58% of the coding region of ATF4 including the entire basic DNA binding domain and the leucine-zipper dimerization domain was substituted with a neomycin resistance gene, no ATF4 transcript was detected by Northern blotting (Fig. 4A), and no ATF4 protein was detected by either Western blotting (23Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34864-34873Google Scholar) or gel shift assays (Fig. 2B), we believe that the difference between the two experiments could be a result of differences in the sensitivities of the two CHOP antisera. We next determined if the ATF4 effects we observed on the transcription of these two genes was exerted entirely through the ATF composite site, or if ATF4 could be the PERK-dependent target that facilitates the activation of the Ire1/XBP-1 and ATF6-dependent branches of the UPR as previously suggested (11Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Google Scholar, 16Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol.

We attempted to transfect both wild-type and ATF4-null MEFs with a CHOP promoter construct that contains the ERSEs, but not the ATF composite site, tethered to a reporter gene (22Ma Y. Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Hendershot L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1351-1365Google Scholar). Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve a high enough transfection efficiency to get a measurable signal in either of the cells. As an alternative approach, we treated wild-type and ATF4-null MEFs with thapsigargin to induce ER stress and compared the induction of BiP and total XBP-1 transcripts, which are downstream of ATF6 (9Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Google Scholar, 10Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Google Scholar). We found no evidence to suggest that the induction of BiP was reduced in the ATF4-null cells, but instead found that the total XBP-1 transcripts were actually slightly increased (Fig. 5A). We then designed PCR oligonucleotides that specifically amplified only the spliced form of the XBP-1 transcript, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR reactions were performed to measure XBP-1 splicing. We found that XBP-1 splicing, which is mediated by the activated Ire-1 endoribonuclease domain, was also not inhibited in the absence of ATF4 (Fig. 5B). A comparison of quantitative data from three different experiments showed that again there was a slight increase in the activity of this arm of the UPR in the ATF4-null cells (Fig. 5C). Finally, we accessed the induction of ERdj4 (35Shen Y. Meunier L. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15947-15956Google Scholar), a recently identified DnaJ homologue that is regulated by XBP-1, not ATF6 (15Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Google Scholar). In keeping with the slightly higher levels of total XBP-1 transcripts and the increased splicing of XBP-1 in the ATF4-null cells, our data showed that the induction of ERdj4 was also somewhat higher in the absence of ATF4 (Fig. 5A). The kinetics of ERdj4 induction are somewhat delayed compared with XBP-1 induction and splicing, which is consistent with it being an XBP-1 target (15Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Google Scholar). Therefore, during ER stress, the attenuated CHOP and Herp induction in ATF4-null MEFs must be due to a loss of activation at the composite site and not to changes in the ATF6 and Ire1/XBP-1 pathways that converge at the ERSE site. Our data reveal that these pathways are completely intact, and even a bit more vigorous, in the ATF4-null animals. ATF4 Was Required for the Activation of CHOP and Herp by Cytosolic Stresses That Activate Other eIF-2α Kinases like GCN2—We next determined the role of ATF4 in the induction of Herp and CHOP by cellular stresses that activate other eIF-2α kinases. We incubated both wild-type and ATF-null MEFs with medium lacking leucine to induce amino acid deprivation stress. This treatment does not activate the ATF6 and"

In an effort to understand the regulation of this channel, we investigated the role of protein phosphorylation in PC-2 function. We demonstrated the direct incorporation of phosphate into PC-2 in cells and tissues and found that this constitutive phosphorylation occurs at Ser812, a putative casein kinase II (CK2) substrate domain.

Channel open probabilities for PC-2 and S812A show a bell-shaped dependence on cytoplasmic Ca2+ but there is a shift in this Ca2+ dependence such that S812A is 10-fold less sensitive to Ca2+ activation/inactivation than the wild type PC-2 channel. In vivo analysis of PC-2-dependent enhanced intracellular Ca2+ transients found that S812A resulted in enhanced transient duration and relative amplitude intermediate between control cells and those overexpressing wild type PC-2.

ADPKD affects more than 1 in 1000 live births and is the most common monogenic cause of kidney failure in humans.

PC-2 is predicted to have at least four serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in its cytoplasmic COOH terminus (2Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M.

In the current study, we sought to determine whether PC-2 is phosphorylated and what the functional role of such phosphorylation may be. We found that PC-2 is constitutively phosphorylated at Ser812 in vivo. Phosphorylation at this site does not effect the subcellular localization or the interaction with Pc-1. However, single channel studies show that loss of phosphorylation at Ser812 results in a significant decrease in the sensitivity of the PC-2 channel to calcium stimulation. Phosphorylation of PC-2 is an important factor in regulating the activity of the channel in vivo. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibody for human polycystin-2, YCE2, was generated by standard hybridoma techniques with the assistance of Susan Buhl of the Hybrydoma Facility at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Briefly, GST fusion protein E2 containing a portion of the COOH terminus of human PC-2 (amino acids 687–754) was used to immunize BALB/C mice (Charles River Inc.). Spleen cells from an immunized mouse were fused to myeloma cells (Ag8.653), and ∼1000 hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using GST fusion protein E2 (positive) and GST alone (negative). Three clones, 21, 156, and 223, among 30 that showed E2-positive results upon enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were characterized further by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry and found to be specific antibodies. The YCE2 antibody used in this study was obtained from cultured supernatant of clone 223, although the other clones were used as well. Polyclonal PC-2 antisera YCC2 and YCB9 have been described previously (18Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol.

PC-2 clones were expressed as COOH-terminal HA or myc-tagged fusion proteins in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Pkd1 cDNA was cloned in segments by reverse transcription-PCR using mouse kidney mRNA (Clontech) as the template. Full-length Pkd1 was assembled from the cloned cDNA fragments and confirmed by bidirectional sequencing of the entire insert. A triple HA-tag (HA) was introduced in-frame immediately prior to the stop codon. A triple FLAG-tag (FLAG) was introduced in-frame between the leader sequence and LRR domain between codons 24 and 25. Cell Lines, Cell Culture, and Immunofluorescent Cell Staining—Cells lines stably expressing Pkd2 and Pkd1 constructs in MDCK, LLC-PK1, and M1 cells were established as described previously (18Cai Y.

Cells were transfected either with PKD2-HA or full-length FLAG-Pkd1-HA cDNA followed by selection with medium containing G418 at 0.4 mg/ml for MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells and 0.2 mg/ml for M1 cells. All cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Clonal stable cell lines were selected by plating the stably overexpressing cells at low density (∼1000 cells per 100-mm dish), and isolated colonies were picked up by using cloning cylinders (Bel-Art Product, Pequannock, NJ). The presence of the PC-2 and Pc-1 expression in the cell lines was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescent cell staining (IF), and IF was done as described previously (18Cai Y. Maeda Y.

Cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy3-laveled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used to image cells by double indirect confocal microscopy (LSM 510, Zeiss). Immunoprecipitation, Glycosylation, and Cell Surface Biotinylation—Immunoprecipitation (IP) of PC-2 was performed using either of YCE2, anti-HA or anti-myc; Pc-1 was IP using anti-FLAG. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40; 1% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS; 150 mm NaCl; 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2; 2 mm EDTA; and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C. IP proteins were washed five times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 6% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue). Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) sensitivity was determined using 1 μl (500 units) of Endo H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as previously described (18Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G.

For cell surface biotinylation studies, cells were plated at high density to allow them to reach confluence after overnight culture. These non-ciliated, living, non-permeabilized confluent cells were immediately labeled using N-hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) at 4 °C as described previously (18Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed, and 20 μl was used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The remaining sample (∼600–800 μl) was IP with streptavidin, and the IP proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using either anti-PC-2-NH2 terminus antisera (YCB9), anti-COOH terminus antisera (YCC2), or anti-Na+K+-ATPase antibody. In Vitro and in Vivo Phosphorylation Analysis—For in vivo [32P]orthophosphate (32Pi) labeling, cultured cells at ∼80% confluence were preincubated in phosphate-free DMEM medium (Invitrogen) with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation in medium containing 32Pi at 1000 μCi/ml for 5 h (19Dickman K.G. Mandel L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C333-C340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm sodium fluoride; 0.2 mm sodium vanadate) followed by PC-2 IP as described above. Proteins eluted from immunoprecipitating antibodies were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The 32Pi-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Total IP proteins were demonstrated by immunoblotting using the same blot. The in vivo 32Pi labeling of mouse kidney tissue was performed as described previously with modifications (19Dickman K.G. Mandel L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C333-C340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kidneys of adult C57/Bl6 mice were excised and immersed in ice-cold H-DMEM medium (Ham's F-12:DMEM, 1:1, supplemented with 2 mm heptanoic acid, 15 mm HEPES, 15 mm NaHCO3, under 5% CO2). The tissue was minced with a razor blade, suspended in 25 ml of digestion medium (H-DMEM supplemented with 150 units/ml collagenase, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 unit/ml DNase), and incubated in CO2 incubator for 1 h. Digested tissue was strained through a tissue sieve and washed three times in H-DMEM. Cells were washed an additional two times in phosphate-free DMEM, then incubated in 1 ml of phosphate-free DMEM with 1 mCi of 32Pi in a 35-mm dish for 5 h at 37 °C. Samples were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors and lysates were made by addition of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described above. The 32Pi-labeled proteins were IP by YCE2. IP proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography followed by immunoblotting using anti-PC-2 polyclonal antisera (YCC2). In vitro casein kinase II (CK2) assays were performed according to the methods reported by Takahashi et al. (20Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Banno T. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28397-28401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins were pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The bound Sepharose beads were sedimented, washed with 400 ml of CK2 buffer (20 mm MES-KOH (pH 6.9), 130 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4.8 mm dithiothreitol), and resuspended in 50 ml of CK2 buffer. The suspension was incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10.0 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.0001 unit of recombinant CK2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with CK2 buffer and re-suspended in sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, followed by Western blotting with anti-GST antibody. Single Channel Recordings and Optical Imaging of Ca2+ Transients—Microsome fractions enriched in ER membranes we prepared from LLC-PK1 cell lines stably overexpressing PC-2 mutant constructs (5Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The presence of the PC-2 mutant proteins in the microsomes was confirmed by immunoblotting using epitope tag antibodies (data not shown). Microsomes were fused to lipid bilayers, and single channel studies were performed as previously described (5Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). To test the effects of phosphatase on channel activity, 4 μl of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 4 units/ml, was added directly to the bilayer on the cis (cytoplasmic) side without stirring. The dephosphorylation reaction was stopped 3 min after CIP addition by stirring the solution in the cis chamber for 30 s. Stirring resulted in a 350-fold reduction of CIP concentration (4 μl in a 1.4-ml dilution), reducing the rate of PC-2 dephosphorylation in the bilayer. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 3 kHz, directly transferred to a computer and analyzed using pClamp version 8.1 software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). For detection of whole cell Ca2+ transients, cells expressing PC-2 constructs were loaded with fluo-4 and imaged using a Ziess Aviovert S100 confocal microscope as described previously (5Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity ratios and t½ for decay back to baseline fluorescence were determined for at least 50 randomly selected cells in each experiment. Comparisons of cellular responses were carried out using one-way analysis of variance on ranks (the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test) with post-test multiple pair-wise comparisons done by Dunn's method. Polycystin-2 Is Constitutively Phosphorylated in Vivo—PC-2 contains six predicted sites for phosphorylation, of which five are in the COOH terminus (2Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Four of these five are conserved in mouse PC-2. Ser801, a predicted PKC phosphorylation site, and Ser812, a casein kinase II (CK2) site, are located within the previously defined ER retention domain (ERD) in the cytosolic COOH terminus of PC-2 (18Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). A pair of predicted protein kinase A/G sites are located upstream of the EF-hand domain and downstream of the ERD at Thr721 and Ser829, respectively (Fig. 1A). To aid in the analysis of PC-2 function, we generated a mouse monoclonal antibody YCE2 against an epitope in the COOH terminus of the human protein (amino acids 687–754). YCE2 can specifically detect overexpressed human PC-2 in transfected cells by both immunoblotting and immunofluorescent cell staining (data not shown). YCE2 can immunoprecipitate (IP) both overexpressed and endogenous PC-2 from LLC-PK1 cells as well as endogenous Pc-2 from mouse kidney tissue (Fig. 1, B and C). We first examined whether PC-2 is phosphorylated in cells in culture. Cells expressing human PC-2 were incubated with 32Pi and the lysates IP using YCE2. Autoradiography of the IP protein resolved by SDS-PAGE revealed a single band migrating at ∼110 kDa. Immunoblotting of the same membrane with YCC2 polyclonal anti-PC-2 confirmed that the phosphorylated IP protein was indeed PC-2 (Fig. 1D). We found that phosphorylation of PC-2 was independent of the particular cell line used as three independent epithelial cell lines (LLC-PK1, MDCK, and M1) all showed similar results (Fig. 1D). The data suggest that PC-2 is constitutively phosphorylated in renal epithelial cells. To test whether endogenous PC-2 is phosphorylated in the kidney, dissociated mouse kidney cells was incubated with 32Pi, lysed, and immunoprecipitated by YCE2 antibody. Native PC-2 from mouse kidney was phosphorylated (Fig. 1E), supporting the conclusion that PC-2 is constitutively phosphorylated in the kidney in vivo. The Site of Phosphorylation of PC-2 Is Ser812—The majority of the predicted phosphorylation sites in PC-2 are located in the COOH terminus. To determine whether the observed phosphorylation of PC-2 occurs in the COOH terminus, we examined phosphorylation of a COOH-terminal truncated form of PC-2, L703X-HA (18Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This truncated form of PC-2 is stable and traffics to both the ER compartment and the cell surface (18Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In contrast to full-length PC-2, L703X-HA was not phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the site for constitutive phosphorylation for PC-2 is located within the COOH terminus. To determine the specific residues for phosphorylation, we substituted alanine (Ala) at various combinations of four predicted phosphorylation sites of the COOH terminus, Thr721, Ser801, Ser812, and Ser829 (clone PC-2-B10, Fig. 2A). We transiently transfected PC-2-B10, with all four predicted sites substituted by alanine, into MDCK cells, and performed in vivo phosphorylation analysis. PC-2-B10 was not phosphorylated (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the one or more substrate residues for phosphorylation are among the four predicted sites in the COOH terminus. Phosphorylation analysis using PC-2-B10, PC-2-B5, and the T721A and S812A single point substitution mutant proteins (Fig. 2A) identified Ser812 as the site of constitutive phosphorylation of PC-2 (Fig. 2D). Ser812 Can Be Phosphorylated by Casein Kinase II—Ser812 is a candidate substrate residue for casein kinase II (CK2) (2Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), a ubiquitously distributed Ser/Thr protein kinase. To confirm that CK2 is expressed in renal epithelial cells where the polycystic kidney disease phenotype manifests, mouse kidney tissue as well as LLC-PK1 epithelial cells were examined by immunoblotting using anti-CK2 antibody. CK2 is expressed in mouse kidney and LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 3A). We next tested whether PC-2 is phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro. Purified GST fusion proteins containing the COOH terminus of PC-2 with or without mutations affecting the phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3B) were assayed for phosphorylation by CK2. Deletion of the ER retention domain (ERD) that contains both Ser801 and Ser812 resulted in loss of phosphorylation by CK2 (Fig. 3C). When GST fusion proteins carrying single amino acid substitutions at Ser801 and Ser812 were assayed, S801A mutants were phosphorylated normally, whereas S12A mutants were not (Fig. 3D). These finding are consistent with Ser812 being a site of phosphorylation by CK2. Phosphorylation at Ser812 Is Not Required for Subcellular Localization or Protein Interaction—Although there remains some controversy in the subcellular location of PC-2, there is general agreement that PC-2 is expressed in the ER and primary cilia of epithelial cells (6Pazour G.J.

We examined the role of phosphorylation at Ser812 in the subcellular localization of PC-2. Non-phosphorylated S812A forms of PC-2 in non-ciliated cells retain complete endoglycosidase H (Endo H) sensitivity as is observed for wild type PC-2 (Fig. 4A) (5Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y.

Phosphorylation-deficient forms of PC-2 with an otherwise intact COOH terminus capable of protein interactions (see below) cannot be biotinylated at the cell surface in confluent but non-ciliated cells (Fig. 4B). When the cells overexpressing the myc-tagged S812A phosphorylation-deficient form of PC-2 are cultured under conditions allowing cilia formation, S812A localizes to cilia in a manner similar to wild type overexpressed PC-2 (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these data suggest that loss of phosphorylation at Ser812 does not alter the trafficking of PC-2 within the cell. PC-2 interacts with Pc-1, and this interaction is thought to be essential to the normal function of both proteins in kidney epithelia (4Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L.

In the present study, we determined the structure and chromosomal location of the human GST Kappa 1 (hGSTK1) gene, characterized the protein, and demonstrated its subcellular localization. The human gene spans ∼5 kb, has 8 exons, and maps onto chromosome 7q34. The 5′-flanking region lacks TATA or CCAAT boxes, but there is an initiator element overlapping the transcription start site. hGSTK1 amino acid sequence showed homology to bacterial 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate isomerase, an enzyme involved in naphthalene degradation pathway. hGSTK1 mRNA was expressed in all of the organs examined. Subcellular fractionation of HepG2 cells showed that the protein was located in peroxisomes and mitochondria and was not detectable in cytoplasm. The peroxisomal localization was confirmed by transfection of HepG2 cells with a plasmid coding a green fluorescent protein fused inframe to the N terminus of hGSTK1. The C terminus of hGSTK1 was essential for localization of the protein to peroxisomes, and the C-terminal sequence Ala-Arg-Leu represents a peroxisome targeting signal.

Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). These include chemical carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, and products of oxidative stress. In addition to their major role in catalyzing the conjugation of electrophilic substrates to glutathione, these enzymes have GSH-dependent peroxidase (2Hurst R. Bao Y. Jemth P. Mannervik B.

Based primarily on protein sequence similarity, the soluble GSTs have been divided in eight families that are highly conserved between species: Alpha, Mu, Pi, Theta, Kappa, Sigma, Zeta, and Omega (1Hayes J.D.

The GSTs of each family have short regions of high identity in common and share a common evolutionary pathway (13Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Soluble GSTs have been described mainly in cytoplasm but are also present in the nucleus and the mitochondrion where they could have functions peculiar to the integrity of these organelles (14Soboll S. Grundel S. Harris J. Kolb-Bachofen V. Ketterer B. Sies H. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Raza H. Robin M.A. Fang J.K. Avadhani N.G. Biochem.

For example, GSTP1 in the nucleus might be associated with protection of DNA damage induced by doxorubicin and consequently in the acquisition of resistance to anticancer drugs by cancer cells (17Goto S. Ihara Y. Urata Y. Izumi S. Abe K. Koji T. Kondo T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2702-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the GSTs known to be present in the mitochondrion (i.e., GSTA1, GSTA4 and GSTM1) may play an important role in defense against chemical and oxidative stress (15Raza H. Robin M.A. Fang J.K. Avadhani N.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 45-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the eight classes of soluble GSTs, the Kappa class has been the least studied. In 1991, Harris et al. (18Harris J.M. Meyer D.J. Coles B. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reported the purification of a GST isolated from mitochondrial matrix of rat liver, GST13-13. Although this subunit was initially classified as a class Theta GST on the basis of N-terminal analysis, elucidation of its complete amino acid sequence by Pemble et al. (9Pemble S.E. Wardle A.F. Taylor J.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) showed the absence of sequence similarity to any other class of GST. Pemble et al. also identified human sequences in expressed sequence tag database that showed a high nucleotide similarity (77%) to that of rat GST subunit 13. Therefore, these GSTs were assigned to the Kappa class, with the rat GST subunit 13 and the human gene being rGSTK1 and hGSTK1, respectively. More recently, Jowsey et al. (19Jowsey I.R. Thomson R.E. Orton T.C. Elcombe C.R. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 559-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified and characterized a murine class Kappa subunit: mGSTK1. This protein has been reported to be present at substantially higher levels in the mitochondrial fraction than the cytosolic fraction of rodent liver. The aim of the present study was to characterize the human GST Kappa at the gene and protein levels. Our results demonstrate that the hGSTK1 is encoded by a gene present on chromosome 7q34 and is expressed in all tissues studied, and its amino acid sequence presents similarities with a bacterial enzyme, 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate (HCCA) isomerase. Furthermore, we showed for the first time the localization of a GST in the peroxisome, because hGSTK1 is present in this organelle.

Briefly, cDNAs from human heart were amplified with nested primers to the RNA adapter (5′-GCTGATGGCGATGAATGAACACTG-3′) and an antisense hGSTK1-specific primer localized in exon 3 (5′-CATCACAGACAAGAAATCCT-3′). The PCR product was reamplified using a nested inner RNA adapter primer (Ambion, RLM-RACE kit) and an antisense hGSTK1-specific primer in exon 2 (5′-CCACTGTCTTTCATGATCCC-3′). PCR was carried out using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen), using the following conditions: denaturing at 94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles amplification 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30s, 68 °C for 60 s; and final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. PCR products from the second amplification were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels and were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid Constructs—To generate the pEGFP-hGSTK1 plasmid, the hGSTK1 cDNA sequence was amplified by PCR with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity using the sequences 5′-CTCAGATCTTATGGGGCCCCTGCCGCGCACC-3′ and 5′-ACCGTCGACTTAAAGTCTGGCATTCACGGC-3′ for forward and reverse primers, respectively. pEGFP-hGSTK1ΔARL was constructed by using the same forward primer and a reverse primer (5′-ACCGTCGACTTAATTCACGGCTGGAGGTAT-3′) lacking the last 9 nucleotides coding for the C-terminal alanine-arginine-leucine (ARL). The PCR fragments were cloned in frame into the SalI and BglII sites of pEGFP-C1, generating a fusion protein of the mammalian codon-optimized enhanced GFP protein with hGSTK1 linked to its C terminus. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. pDsRed2-Peroxi is a mammalian expression vector that encodes a red fluorescent protein containing peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1). Expression and Purification of hGSTK1 Proteins—The hGSTK1 open reading frame was cloned by ligation-independent cloning using a Affinity LIC cloning and protein purification kit (pCAL-n-FLAG, Stratagene) to yield full-length hGSTK1 protein containing an N-terminal 27-amino acid calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP) tag. CBP-hGSTK1 was overexpressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction for 3.5 h at 37 °C. The purification procedure followed the instructions of the manufacturer with some modification. The frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm imidazole, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Lysozyme (200 μg/ml) was added, and the suspension was incubated with gentle shaking on ice for 15 min. The cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysate was applied on a calmodulin-resin column equilibrated in lysis buffer. The column was washed with five volumes of lysis buffer and five volumes of buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm imidazole, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The proteins were eluted in elution buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Elution fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The native hGSTK1 was obtained after digestion with 1 unit of enterokinase/20 μg of fusion protein. The protein was dialyzed for 24 h at 4 °C against two changes, each of 2 liters, of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA. Antiserum against purified hGSTK1 protein was raised in rabbits using a standard immunization protocol (Eurogentec, Liege, Belgium). Sequence Analysis—Dye terminator DNA sequencing was performed from both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the PCR-amplified genomic products using BigDye terminators (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an Applied Biosystems Prism 3100 genetic analyzer. RNA Sources and Preparation—A Human Total RNA Master Panel was purchased from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto) containing total RNA isolated from 24 different human tissues. The RNA from these tissues had been pooled from multiple individuals of each gender, with the exception of heart (25-year-old male) and brain (28-year-old male). Reverse Transcription-Quantitative PCR Analysis—RNAs were reversed-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols with the following exceptions: 1 μg of total RNA and random hexamer primers (500 ng) were used in each reverse transcription reaction. cDNAs were stored at -20 °C until use as template in subsequent PCRs. Real time quantitative PCR was performed by the fluorescent dye SYBR Green methodology using the qPCR™ Core Kit for Sybr™ Green I from Eurogenetec and the ABI Prism 7000 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primer pairs for hGSTK1 were chosen with the Primers 3 (www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi): forward, 5′-GAAGAGCAAGCTCAGGGAGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGGTCAGACCCAAATAGCAT-3′. Briefly, cDNA was mixed with 22 μl of Master Mix containing 10× reaction buffer, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 300 nm of each primer, 0.025 unit/μl Hot GoldStar enzyme, and 0.75 μl of 1/2000 diluted SYBR Green stock in a final volume of 25 μl. A first step of 10 min at 95 °C was followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s). For each sample, the ABI Prism 7000 software provided an amplification curve constructed by relating the fluorescence signal intensity (normalized to the fluorescence of ROX internal passive reference) to the cycle number. Cycle threshold (Ct) was defined as the cycle number at which a significant increase in the fluorescence signal was first detected. The relative quantification of the steady state of the target mRNA levels was calculated after normalization of the total amount of cDNA tested by an active reference, 18 S. Subcellular Fractionation—Human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells were homogenized in isotonic (0.25 m) sucrose buffered with 10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, pH 7.8 (homogenization buffer) using a Teflon and glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The nuclei, cell debris, and heavy mitochondria were removed by a 10-min centrifugation at 3,000 × g.A “light mitochondrial fraction” containing lysosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and some microsomes was obtained by centrifugation of the supernatants at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The peroxisomes were purified from the light mitochondrial fraction by ultracentrifugation (180,000 × g for 4.5 h) in a self-forming density gradient of iodixanol following the manufacturer's protocol (Axis-shield). Immediately after centrifugation, eight fractions from the gradient were collected with a syringe by upward displacement. Western Blot Analysis—HepG2 proteins were dissolved in 10% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 20% glycerol. 25 μg of protein were electrophoresed on a 12.5% polyacrylamide slab gel and electroblotted overnight onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). After the filters were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin, Tris-buffered saline, they were incubated with rabbit anti-hGSTK1, anti-catalase, anti-cytochrome c or anti-caspase 3 antibodies. The filters were then washed in wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.01% Tween 20) and Tris-buffered saline and incubated with peroxidase conjugated rabbit anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO SA). All of the incubations were done at room temperature for 2 h. Peroxidase activity was detected using ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Transfection and Co-localization Studies—HepG2 cells were co-transfected with the pEGFP-hGSTK1 and pDsRED2-peroxi plasmids. Transfection of HepG2 cells was accomplished by electroporation with a 1-s pulse from an 1800-microfarad capacitor charged to 230 V. The transfected cells were then plated out and grown in Williams E medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Under these conditions, the cells were seeded in 6-well plates containing glass coverslips coated with fetal bovine serum. Fluorescence Microscopy—The images were obtained on an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope fitted with a digital camera and processed using Adobe Photoshop, version 7. Biochemical Assays—All of the GST enzyme activity assays were conducted at 30 °C and measured with a Beckmann spectrophotometer. In all cases, the nonenzymatic reaction was measured and subtracted from the overall reaction rate. Activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and glutathione-peroxidase activity (cumene hydroperoxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and 15-S-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid) were measured at 340 nm. For glutathione-peroxidase activities, product formation was determined using the coupled NADPH/glutathione reductase-dependent reduction of the oxidized glutathione product under conditions where the GST-dependent peroxidase activity was rate-limiting. Other activities were measured as followed: 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (345 nm, pH 7.5), ethacrynic acid (270 nm, pH 6.5), trans-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (290 nm, pH 6.5), trans-nonenal (225 nm, pH 6.5), and 1,2-epoxy-3-(4′-nitrophenoxy)propane (360 nm, pH 6.5). The protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Characterization of the Human GSTK1 Gene and Its 5′-Flanking Region—Comparison of human GST Kappa cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_015917) to the High Throughput Genome Sequences subset of GenBank™ using the BLASTN program identified one BAC clone RP11–556I13 (GenBank™ accession number AC073342) located on chromosome 7q34. The sequence of this clone was established as part of a mapping and sequencing collaboration between the NHGRI Chromosome 7 Mapping Project and the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center. Alignment of cDNA with genomic sequences revealed that the hGSTK1 gene spans 5.68 kb and contains eight exons separated by seven introns (Fig. 1, A and B). This genomic structure was confirmed by using human genomic DNA and amplification of each intron by PCR with primers localized in adjacent exons. Each DNA fragment was then sequenced. The nucleotide sequence data appear in the GenBank™ nucleotide sequence data bases under the accession number AY486465. The rules for the intron/exon junctions are fulfilled for all exons, and an open reading frame is present starting in exon 1. Exon 8 encompasses the 3′-untranslated region of the corresponding mRNA. The polyadenylation site, which begins at 250 bp downstream of the stop codon, is of a commonly found type: AATAAA (Fig. 2). To compare hGSTK1 gene structure with the recently described mouse and rat GST Kappa genes (19Jowsey I.R. Thomson R.E. Orton T.C. Elcombe C.R. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 559-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed the three sequences by the MULTIPIPMAKER program. This program transformed the alignment into percent positional identity plots in the three sequences. Fig. 1C shows the positions of aligned regions over the entire gene sequence including 2 kb upstream from exon 1. This figure demonstrates a high conservation of genomic organization between the three genes. The degree of conservation in these three genes (exons and introns) is remarkably similar, except that the human sequence is longer than the rat and mouse in intron 5, which contains additional repeat sequences. In contrast, there is no homology in the 5′-flanking regions between human and rodent sequences.Fig. 2DNA sequence of thehGSTK1gene. The underlined sequences show putative recognition sites for transcription factors. The initiator sequence (Inr) overlaps the putative transcription start site marked as +1.

By using heart cDNA, amplification of a single fragment was obtained, indicating that the adenine residue marked +1 in Fig. 2 and localized 23 bp upstream of the ATG codon could be the transcription start site. The putative promoter region upstream from the start site possesses neither CCAAT nor TATA boxes but has a sequence similar to the initiator sequence (YYANT/AYY) overlapping the transcription initiation site (22Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). STAT and Sp1 transcription factors and a GC-rich region were also found in the proximal promoter (Fig. 2). Quantitative Analysis of the GSTK1 Transcripts in Human Tissues by Real Time PCR—Tissue distribution and expression levels of hGSTK1 transcripts were investigated by the real time PCR method. hGSTK1 mRNA was expressed ubiquitously, but at variable levels, in all tissues examined and being most abundant in kidney, liver, and the adrenal gland (Fig. 3). hGSTK1 Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—Comparison of hG-STK1 amino acid sequence to the Swissprot subset of GenBank™ using the BLASTp program showed similarity to rat and mouse GST Kappa, a Caenorhabditis elegans GST and bacterial HCCA isomerase enzymes. Alignment of these sequences by using the CLUSTALW and BOXSHADE programs is shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), respectively. The amino acid sequence of hGSTK1 is similar to that of rat and mouse GSTK1 (69.5 and 71.2% identity, respectively). Regarding alignment with other proteins, identity was 33% with C. elegans GST (YS21_CAEEL) and 24% with HCCA isomerases (NahD, PhnD, and NagD). Furthermore, the protein family data base of alignments (Pfam) analysis suggested that the hGSTK1 amino acid sequence shares a putative conserved domain with DSBA, an oxidoreductase involved in disulfide bond formation in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria. However, similarities between amino acid sequences of hGSTK1 and E. coli DSBA or Vibrio cholerae DSBA is less than 20% (Fig. 4C). Heterologous Expression and Catalytic Properties of hGSTK1—To purify hGSTK1, a recombinant protein containing an N-terminal CBP tag (CBP-hGSTK1) was overexpressed in E. coli. After affinity purification, hGSTK1 was produced by digestion of CBP-hGSTK1 with enterokinase. The apparent molecular masses of recombinant and native hGSTK1 were respectively 33.5 and 29.5 kDa as judged from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). Recombinant GSTK1 had low activities toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, tert-butyl-hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and 15-S-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid. In contrast, activities toward 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene, ethacrynic acid, trans-nonenal, trans-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, and 1,2-epoxy-3-(4′-nitrophenoxy)propane were not detectable (Table I).Table IActivity of hGSTK1 towards various substrates The values are the means ± S.D. of at least three determinations.

To confirm the presence of hGSTK1 in peroxisomes, we prepared subcellular fractions of HepG2 cells. Because differential centrifugation does not yield totally pure organelle fractions, we used equilibrium density gradient centrifugation of the light mitochondrial fraction. This method separates cellular components according to their density, allowing the separation of mitochondria (median density of approximately 1.145 g/ml) and peroxisomes (the densest of the major subcellular organelles with ρ = 1.18–1.20 g/ml). Fig. 6 shows Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions of HepG2 cells using antibodies specific for hGSTK1, catalase, cytochrome c, and caspase 3. hGSTK1 was detected in peroxisomal and mitochondrial fractions but not in cytosol, whereas catalase, cytochrome c, and caspase 3 were detected, mainly, in peroxisomes, mitochondria and cytosol, respectively. To confirm the subcellular localization of hGSTK1 and the functionality of the peroxisomal targeting signal at its C-terminal end, plasmid constructs were prepared with the cDNA encoding the GFP protein fused in-frame to the N terminus of hGSTK1 (pEGFP-hGSTK1). This construct was co-transfected with pD-sRed2-Peroxi (a mammalian expression vector that encodes a fusion of Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein and the peroxisomal targeting signal 1) into HepG2 cells. Both the tagged protein EGFP-hGSTK1 and the red fluorescent peroxisomal protein were co-localized in peroxisomes (Fig. 7, A and B). By contrast, transfection of a construct lacking the tripeptide ARL (pEGFP-hGSTK1ΔARL) showed a diffuse distribution of fluorescence in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 7, C and D).Fig. 7Intracellular localization of EGFP-hGSTK1 constructs in transfected HepG2 cells. Forty-eight hours after co-transfection with the EGFP-hGSTK1 constructs and pDsRed2-peroxi vector, HepG2 cells were fixed and visualized directly using microscopy. Localization of hGSTK1 in fusion with EGFP in peroxisomes was confirmed by co-localization of pEGFP-hGSTK1 (A) and pDsRED-peroxi (B).

(18Harris J.M. Meyer D.J. Coles B. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), who isolated homodimeric GST13-13 (now named rGSTK1) from the rat mitochondrial matrix. Subsequently, a human cDNA was identified that exhibited a high level of identity with rGSTK1 (9Pemble S.E. Wardle A.F. Taylor J.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, the hGSTK1 gene and protein have not been extensively characterized. The gene encoding hGSTK1 is located on chromosome 7q34. Typically, the individual genes for each GST class are clustered together on the same chromosome (23Coggan M. Whitbread L. Whittington A.

The fact that no other related sequences were found neither in this chromosomal region nor in other part of the genome seems to indicate that hGSTK1 is the only representative in this GST family in humans.

https://openalex.org/W1995012673,"1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) is a neurotoxin that causes Parkinson's disease in experimental animals and humans. Despite the fact that intracellular iron was shown to be crucial for MPP+-induced apoptotic cell death, the molecular mechanisms for the iron requirement remain unclear. We investigated the role of transferrin receptor (TfR) and iron in modulating the expression of α-synuclein (α-syn) in MPP+-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. Results show that MPP+ inhibits mitochondrial complex-1 and aconitase activities leading to enhanced H2O2 generation, TfR expression and α-syn expression/aggregation. Pretreatment with cell-permeable iron chelators, TfR antibody (that inhibits TfR-mediated iron uptake), or transfection with glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) enzyme inhibits intracellular oxidant generation, α-syn expression/aggregation, and apoptotic signaling as measured by caspase-3 activation. Cells overexpressing α-syn exacerbated MPP+ toxicity, whereas antisense α-syn treatment totally abrogated MPP+-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells without affecting oxidant generation. The increased cytotoxic effects of α-syn in MPP+-treated cells were attributed to inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and proteasomal function. We conclude that MPP+-induced iron signaling is responsible for intracellular oxidant generation, α-syn expression, proteasomal dysfunction, and apoptosis. Relevance to Parkinson's disease is discussed. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) is a neurotoxin that causes Parkinson's disease in experimental animals and humans.

J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 2Hornykiewicz O. Neurology. 1998; 51: S2-S9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that α-synuclein (α-syn), parkin, ubiquitin, and iron constitute a major fraction of Lewy body aggregates (3Kaur D. Andersen J.K. Ageing Cell. 2002; 1: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Defects in mitochondrial complex-1 activity and dopamine deficiency were detected in patients suffering from PD (4Parker Jr., W.D. Boyson S.J. Parks J K. Ann. Neurol. 1989; 26: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 5Fahan S. Przedborski S. Rowland L.P. Merritt's Neurology. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, New York2000: 679-695Google Scholar). Mitochondrial complex-1 inhibitors such as 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a metabolic product of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and rotenone have been shown to induce symptoms similar to those of PD in experimental animals and humans (6Schmidt N. Ferger B. J. Neural. Transm. 2001; 108: 1263-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 7Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Stout A.K. Lund S. Baptista M. Panov A.V. Cookson M.R. Greenamyre J.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7006-7015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several in vitro studies using MPP+ and rotenone showed that these compounds can induce oxidative stress and apoptosis and other biochemical changes similar to those observed in patients afflicted with idiopathic PD (8Fiskum G. Starkov A. Polster B.M. Chinopoulos C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 991: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Hartley A. Stone J.M. Heron C. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1987-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The conversion of MPTP to MPP+ is required for toxicity, and this conversion is catalyzed by monoamine oxidase type B in the brain (10Chiba K. Trevor A. Castagnoli Jr., N Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). MPP+ is transported into dopaminergic neurons by the dopamine transporter and is concentrated into mitochondria, where it causes ATP depletion by inhibiting complex-1 activity, leading to alterations in the mitochondrial membrane potential and finally to cell death (11Bates T.E. Heales S.J. Davies S.E. Boakye P. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that MPTP and/or MPP+ and rotenone induce α-syn expression and its aggregation (12Lee H.J. Shin S.Y. Choi C. Lee Y.H. Lee S.J. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). α-syn aggregation is considered to be one of the pathological hallmarks of PD (14Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R.

Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of α-syn in cellular toxicity is not well understood. In some cells, α-syn overexpression was found to be protective whereas in others α-syn overexpression elicited increased toxicity (16Seo J.H. Rah J.C. Choi S.H. Shin J.K. Min K. Kim H.S. Park C.H.

Brain Res. 2002; 926: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but the general consensus is that α-syn overexpression is ultimately toxic to dopaminergic neurons (18Xu J. Kao S.Y. Lee F.J. Song W. Jin L.W. Yankner B.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). However, the mutant forms of α-syn are more toxic compared with the wild type α-syn (19Tabrizi S.J. Orth M. Wilkinson J.M. Taanman J.W. Warner T.T. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H. Hum. Mol.

Additional studies elucidating the molecular signaling events that lead to the up-regulation and aggregation of α-syn in cells are, therefore, warranted. Reports indicate that MPP+ promotes the aggregation of α-syn in neuroblastoma cells (21Kakimura J. Kitamura Y. Takata K. Kohno Y. Nomura Y. Taniguchi T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 417: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Iron and H2O2 exacerbated α-syn aggregation in vitro (22Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sisk A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that MPP+ up-regulates transferrin receptor (TfR) expression and iron uptake, resulting in oxidative stress and apoptosis (23Kalivendi S.V. Kotamraju S. Cunningham S. Shang T. Hillard C.J. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to determine whether MPP+-induced transferrin iron plays a critical role in the up-regulation/aggregation of α-syn leading to enhanced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells. Materials—Carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Fe(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (FeTBAP) was synthesized according to the published procedure (24Day B.J. Shawen S. Liochev S.I. Crapo J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 1227-1232PubMed Google Scholar). N,N′-Bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid (HBED) was obtained as a gift from Dr. Cherakuri Muralikrishna (National Institutes of Health). MPP+ iodide, l-nitroarginine-N-methyl ester (l-NAME) and other chemicals for buffer preparations were purchased from Sigma. LipofectAMINE reagent was obtained from Invitrogen. Adenovirus containing full-length GPx1 (Ad.CMV-GPx1) was a generous gift from Dr. Larry Oberley (University of Iowa). Ad-CMV-GFP was obtained from the adenoviral core facility, Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI). MAP kinase inhibitor U0126 was obtained from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibody, 42/6, against human TfR was a gift from Dr. Ian Towbridge (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). Culturing of Human Neuroblastoma Cells—Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) obtained from the American Type Cell Collection were transferred to 75-cm2 filter vent flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA), grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine (4 mmol/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. For experiments, cells were seeded in six-well dishes and grown to a confluence of 70–80%. Twelve hours before the start of treatment, medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% FBS. The above conditions were applied to all of the experiments performed in this study. Cell Treatments—Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed in neuroblastoma cells cultured in 6-well plates. Cells were pretreated for 2 h individually with the following agents: media alone, FeTBAP (25 μm) or l-NAME (2.5 mm), HBED (10 μm), U0126 (25 μm), and caspase inhibitors (5 μm) followed by the addition of MPP+ to a final concentration of 5 mm. Following a 16-h incubation period, cell culture media were aspirated, and cells were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and collected by gentle scraping. The cell pellets were washed twice with DPBS and used for subsequent assays. For the time course experiments, neuroblastoma cells were treated with 5 mm MPP+, and cells were collected by gentle scraping at different time points. In some experiments, neuroblastoma cells were treated with 150 μm H2O2 for 6 h. Caspase-3 Activity—Caspase-3 activity was determined in neuroblastoma cell lysates using the Apo-Alert Kit (Clontech). After collection, cells were suspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer supplied in the kit and passed through a 24-gauge needle 10 times to ensure complete lysis. The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 rpm, and 50 μl of the clear supernatant was used for the activity assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. The increase in the optical density at 405 nm was considered as an index of caspase-3 activity. Aconitase Activity—Neuroblastoma cells were washed twice with cold DPBS and lysed with buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 μm DTPA, and 5 mm citrate in PBS. The activity of aconitase was measured in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm dl-trisodium isocitrate at 37 °C. An extinction coefficient for cis-aconitate of 3.6 mm at 240 nm was used (25Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.-L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complex-1 Activity—The activity of mitochondrial complex I was measured as described previously (26Yen H.C. Oberley T.D. Gairola C.G. Szweda L.I. St. Clair D.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Mitochnodrial pellets were frozen and thawed three times in hypotonic buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2). Fifty microliters of the supernatant was added to 1 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.2) containing NADH (100 μm), 65 μm coenzyme Q1, 5 mm MgCl2,2mm KCN, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg/ml antimycin A in a 1.5-ml cuvette at 37 °C. The difference in the rate of NADH oxidation at 340 nm was used as an index of complex-1 activity. Under these conditions, the complex-1-specific activity was inhibited by 2 μg/ml rotenone. Overexpression of GPx1—Adenoviral infection with GPx1 in neuroblastoma cells was performed in a serum-free medium for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection of 500 particles/cell (27Li Q. Sanlioglu S. Li S. Ritchie T. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), followed by the addition of an equal volume of fresh medium containing 20% FBS and 50 nm sodium selenite. Incubation was continued for 24 h. The medium was replaced 24 h after infection with a medium containing 2% FBS, and the cells were subsequently treated with MPP+. These conditions produced nearly 100% transfection with recombinant adenovirus, as assessed with an Ad.CMV-GFP reporter gene expression. GPx1 activity was measured as described earlier (27Li Q. Sanlioglu S. Li S. Ritchie T. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Determination of α-syn and TfR Levels—After terminating the experiment, neuroblastoma cells were washed with ice-cold DPBS and resuspended in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium fluoride). To a 10-ml solution of the above, the following agents were added: 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin inhibitors. The cells were homogenized by passing the suspension through a 25-gauge needle (10 strokes). The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (Bio-Rad), and 40 μg was used for the Western blot analysis. Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin to block the nonspecific protein binding. Membranes were incubated either with monoclonal antibodies raised against human α-syn (Transduction Laboratories) or a mouse anti-human TfR monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) (1 μg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature), washed five times, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Both α-syn and TfR bands were detected using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical significance was obtained using Student's t test employing the Sigmastat software. RT-PCR Analysis—Following the termination of experiments, the medium was aspirated, and 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was added to cells in 6-well plates, and total RNA was extracted using the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 5 μg of RNA was used for the first strand cDNA synthesis using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) with random hexamers provided in the kit in a final volume of 15 μl. 4 μl of the cDNA mixture was used to amplify mRNA for α-syn, TfR, and 18 S ribosomal RNA by PCR (as a loading control) using the gene-specific primers designed by the Genetics Computer Group, Inc. Cloning of Sense and Antisense α-syn—Total RNA was isolated from neuroblastoma cells using a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Full-length α-syn gene was amplified using high fidelity PCR supermix (Hi FI PCR supermix, Invitrogen) using the forward (5′-AAGCTTAGGAATTCATTAGCCATGGATGTATTC-3′) and reverse (5′-CTCGAGAGATATTTCTTAGGCTTCAGGTTCGTAGT-3′) primers containing HindIII and XhoI restriction sites (shown in boldface type and underlined). Following PCR, the amplified product was digested with HindIII and XhoI and ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) that was predigested with the same restriction enzymes in order to obtain the plasmid for overexpressing α-syn (pcDNA3α-syn). The same full-length PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3.1(-) to obtain the plasmid that expresses antisense mRNA for α-syn. The cloned products were confirmed by the DNA sequence of the plasmid. Transfection of Sense and Antisense α-syn in Neuroblastoma Cells— Neuroblastoma cells in 6-well plates (∼70% confluent) were transfected individually with 3 μg of pcDNA 3 plasmid containing the sense and antisense α-syn gene using the LipofectAMINE reagent as described by the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were treated with DNA-LipofectAMINE complex in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without FBS and antibiotics) for 4 h, followed by the addition of equal amounts of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin), and cells were further incubated for 24 h. After replacing with a fresh medium, cells were allowed to recover for an additional 24 h and used for the experiments. Under these conditions, the transfection efficiency was found to be nearly 50% using the GFP reporter plasmid (pE GFP-N1; Clontech). Measurement of Oxidative Stress—The determination of intracellular oxidant production was based on the oxidation of carboxy-H2DCFDA to the fluorescent product, carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (28LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Following treatment of cells with MPP+, the media were aspirated, and cells were washed twice with DPBS and then placed in 1 ml of cell culture medium without FBS. The carboxy-H2DCFDA was added to a final concentration of 10 μm, and cells were incubated for 20 min. The cells were again washed once with DPBS and maintained in 1 ml of culture medium. Intracellular fluorescence was monitored at wavelengths of 480/30 nm (excitation) and 535/40 nm (emission). The fluorescence intensity values from three different fields of view were calculated using the Metamorph software and averaged. Measurement of 26 S Proteasomal Activity—Proteasome function was measured as reported (29Pajonk F. Riess K. Sommer A. McBride W.H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with buffer I (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP) and then homogenized with buffer I containing 250 mm sucrose. Twenty micrograms of 10,000 × g supernatant were diluted with buffer I to a final volume of 900 μl. The fluorogenic proteasome substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Lys-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (trypsin-like) was added in a final concentration of 80 μm. Proteolytic activity was measured by monitoring the release of the fluorescent group 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (excitation and emission at 380 and 460 nm). MPP+ Induces α-syn Overexpression and Aggregation in Neuroblastoma Cells—The addition of MPP+ to neuroblastoma cells induced a time-dependent increase in α-syn protein levels (Fig. 1A, monomer). A nearly 3-fold increase in protein expression was detected after an 8-h time period in MPP+-treated cells that remained elevated up to 12 h (Fig. 1B). During the same time period, the high molecular weight bands corresponding to the dimeric and oligomeric forms of α-syn were induced (Fig. 1A, monomer and oligomer bands). RT-PCR data also confirmed the same trend as evidenced by the increase in α-syn mRNA levels following MPP+ treatment. The transcription of α-syn mRNA started to increase as early as 6 h after MPP+ treatment (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1C also shows that this observed increase is not due to differences in sample loading, as detected using 18 S rRNA during the same time period. These results indicate that α-syn expression is regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels in response to MPP+ treatment. Concomitant with an increased α-syn expression (Fig. 1A, monomer), both dimeric and oligomeric forms of α-syn increased in MPP+-treated cells (Fig. 1A). MPP+ Induces Oxidative Stress, TfR Expression, and Apoptosis—The inactivation of aconitase in MPP+-treated neuroblastoma cells was measured as an index of oxidative stress. There was a significant decline with time in the aconitase activity after a 4-h treatment in cells treated with MPP+ (Fig. 2A). During the same incubation period, an increase in the expression of TfR levels was observed (Fig. 2B). As shown, TfR levels increased in MPP+-treated cells after 4 h and remained elevated up to 12 h (Fig. 2B). The RT-PCR data obtained under these conditions did not show any significant increase in TfR mRNA levels (Fig. 2C). A significant increase in the caspase-3-like proteolytic activity was detected in neuroblastoma cells treated with MPP+. A 4–5-fold increase in caspase-3 activity was seen after a period of 12–16 h in MPP+-treated cells (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that MPP+ initially causes oxidative stress as demonstrated by the decrease in aconitase activity followed by TfR expression and finally leads to apoptosis. These findings implicate an oxidative mechanism, possibly involving iron, in MPP+-dependent apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Effect of Iron Chelators and Antioxidants on MPP+-induced α-syn Expression, Oxidative Stress, and Apoptosis—Previously, we reported that MPP+ induces intracellular H2O2 and iron release in neuroblastoma cells (23Kalivendi S.V. Kotamraju S. Cunningham S. Shang T. Hillard C.J. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, we surmised that H2O2 and iron could be responsible for MPP+-induced overexpression and aggregation of α-syn. In control experiments, MPP+ treatment caused greater than 50% decrease in the aconitase activity in cells following a 4–6-h treatment with MPP+ (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment of neuroblastoma cells with FeTBAP (a superoxide dismutase mimetic that is also a scavenger of H2O2) or a cell-permeable iron chelator, HBED, restored the aconitase activity in neuroblastoma cells treated with MPP+ (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of cells with GPx1 that detoxifies intracellular H2O2 counteracted MPP+-induced inactivation of aconitase (Fig. 3A). Treatment of cells with l-NAME, a nonspecific inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase, had little or no effect on oxidative inactivation of aconitase in MPP+-treated cells (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that MPP+-induced inactivation of aconitase was mediated by intracellular hydrogen peroxide and iron. To investigate more fully the mechanism of iron-induced α-syn aggregation and the origin of intracellular iron, we determined the effect of a TfR antibody (which binds to the extracellular domain of TfR and inhibits entry of iron into cells). Pretreatment of cells with TfR antibody dramatically inhibited α-syn expression and aggregation (Fig. 3, B and C) as well as the transcription of α-syn mRNA (Fig. 3D), suggesting that iron transported through TfR is responsible for α-syn expression and aggregation. The MPP+-induced apoptosis, as measured by the proteolytic activation of caspase-3, was inhibited by FeTBAP, TfR antibody, and GPx1 overexpression (Fig. 3E). Collectively, these findings implicate a causal role for transferrin iron and H2O2 in MPP+-induced α-syn up-regulation, aggregation, and apoptosis. Next we sought to determine whether hydrogen peroxide treatment alone could enhance α-syn expression/aggregation and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Immunoblotting of α-syn revealed that the protein levels were significantly increased in cells exposed to H2O2 for 4 h (Fig. 4, A and B). The RT-PCR analysis demonstrated an increase in α-syn mRNA during the same incubation time (Fig. 4C). Concomitant with increased expression of α-syn, the caspase-3 activity was also enhanced in cells treated with H2O2 (Fig. 4D). Effect of Modulating α-syn Levels on MPP+-induced Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis—To determine whether α-syn is causally responsible for MPP+-dependent apoptosis or whether α-syn up-regulation by MPP+ is simply a parallel consequence, we employed α-syn-overexpressing and -underexpressing neuroblastoma cells. To this end, neuroblastoma cells were individually transfected with 3 μg of pcDNA 3 plasmid containing the sense and antisense α-syn gene, using the LipofectAMINE reagent as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The transfection efficiency was nearly 50% using the GFP reporter plasmid (pE GFP-N1; Clontech). As shown in Fig. 5A, α-syn protein levels in the cytosol increased 6-fold in neuroblastoma cells transfected with sense plasmid and 3-fold less than the control in the antisense α-syn-treated cells. We measured caspase-3 activation in these cells after treatment with MPP+ for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 5B, the caspase-3 activation induced by MPP+ was completely inhibited in antisense α-syn-treated cells. In contrast, the addition of MPP+ to α-syn-overexpressing cells enhanced the caspase-3 activity compared with control cells (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that α-syn is necessary for MPP+-mediated apoptosis. Next we measured the oxidative stress response in α-syn-overexpressing and -underexpressing cells. Fig. 5, C and D, shows that the aconitase and mitochondrial complex-1 activities were decreased by 2–3-fold in cells treated with MPP+ for 12 h. However, unlike caspase-3 activation, the aconitase and mitochondrial complex-1 activities remained unchanged in response to modulation of α-syn levels in neuroblastoma cells. MPP+ treatment of α-syn-overexpressing and -underexpressing cells did not affect aconitase or complex-1 activities (Fig. 5, C and D). Previously, we reported that MPP+-induced oxidation of dichlorodihydrofluorescein to DCF is dependent on intracellular H2O2 and iron (23Kalivendi S.V. Kotamraju S. Cunningham S. Shang T. Hillard C.J. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). MPP+-induced DCF fluorescence was inhibited by GPx1 overexpression, cell-permeable iron chelators, and TfR antibody, suggesting that both TfR-induced iron uptake and intracellular H2O2 were responsible for increased intracellular DCF fluorescence. DCF fluorescence was unaffected in antisense α-syn-transfected neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 5, E and F). As shown, MPP+-induced DCF staining was not inhibited by either α-syn overexpression or transfection with antisense α-syn plasmid. Based on these results, we conclude that MPP+-induced oxidative stress is upstream of α-syn expression and not vice versa. α-syn overexpression in cells may induce apoptotic signaling by mechanisms other than intracellular oxidative stress. Possible Role of MAP Kinase and Proteasome in α-syn-mediated Apoptosis—Recent reports suggest that α-syn can inhibit the activities of MAP kinases and proteasome (30Iwata A. Maruyama M. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45320-45329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 31Snyder H. Mensah K. Theisler C. Lee J. Matouschek A. Wolozin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11753-11759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This implicates that MPP+-induced α-syn might play an indirect role by inhibiting ERK/MAP kinase, as has been suggested previously (30Iwata A. Maruyama M. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45320-45329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and that the antisense α-syn-treated cells confer protection against MPP+-induced apoptosis, possibly through elevating the MAP kinase activity. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that treatment of cells with a specific ERK/MAP kinase inhibitor, U0126, abrogated the protection afforded by the antisense α-syn toward MPP+-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6A). Results also showed that trypsin-like activity associated with the 26 S proteasome was diminished in MPP+-treated cells and in α-syn-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6B); however, the antisense α-syn treatment significantly restored the trypsin-like activity in presence of MPP+. These results indicate that α-syn can potentially interfere with ERK/MAP kinase regulation and/or inhibit proteasomal function (i.e. factors leading to enhanced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells). However, it is not yet clear whether the two pathways are mutually exclusive. In this study, we showed that"

https://openalex.org/W1970215626,"ERBB2 is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by a gene located in chromosome region 17q12. Overexpression of ERBB2, generally by way of gene amplification, plays a role in mammary oncogenesis. This alteration can be overcome by use of the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). Accurate determination of ERBB2 status is required for appropriate use of this targeted therapy and is currently analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue sections and/or fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) on interphase chromosomes. We have studied the gene expression profiles of a series of 213 breast tumours and 16 breast cancer cell lines with known ERBB2 status, using Ipsogen's DiscoveryChip microarrays with approximately 9000 cDNAs. We have identified 36 genes and expressed sequence tags that were differentially expressed in tumours and in cell lines with and without ERBB2 protein overexpression. This ERBB2-specific gene expression signature (GES) contained 29 overexpressed genes including the ERBB2 gene itself, five genes located in its immediate vicinity on 17q12, non-17q genes such as GATA4 and eight downregulated genes including oestrogen receptor alpha (ER). Some correlations were validated at the protein level using IHC on tissue microarrays. The GES was able to distinguish ERBB2-negative and -positive cancer samples, as well as FISH-negative and FISH-positive ERBB2 2+ IHC samples."
https://openalex.org/W2112224971,"Saccadic eye movements transiently distort perceptual space. Visual objects flashed shortly before or during a saccade are mislocalized along the saccade direction, resembling a compression of space around the saccade target. These mislocalizations reflect transient errors of processes that construct spatial stability across eye movements. They may arise from errors of reference signals associated with saccade direction and amplitude or from visual or visuomotor remapping processes focused on the saccade target's position. The second case would predict apparent position shifts toward the target also in directions orthogonal to the saccade. We report that such orthogonal mislocalization indeed occurs. Surprisingly, however, the orthogonal mislocalization is restricted to only part of the visual field. This part comprises distant positions in saccade direction but does not depend on the target's position. Our findings can be explained by a combination of directional and positional reference signals that varies in time course across the visual field."

To determine the effects of JNK activation in intact heart, we established transgenic animals using a Cre/loxP-mediated gene switch approach to achieve targeted expression of an upstream activator, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (D) (MKK7D), in ventricular myocytes. MKK7D expression led to significant JNK activation, robust induction of the fetal gene program, and contractile dysfunction.

The development of heart failure involves a multistep remodeling process in response to pathological stressors, from compensatory hypertrophy to decompensated chamber remodeling. Stress-induced signaling pathways play an important role in these responses and may contribute to specific features of the remodeling process (1Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ.

Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3611) Google Scholar). Signals transduced by this kinase family ultimately lead to the activation of stress response genes and the synthesis of proteins important for cellular adaptation to the stress stimulus. In the heart, JNK is activated in response to a variety of pathological insults such as hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and myocardial infarction (3Pellieux C. Sauthier T. Aubert J.F.

Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5079-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) also demonstrated an anti-hypertrophic role for JNK signaling using loss of function approaches. Thus, considerable evidence implicates JNK signaling in cardiac pathogenesis, yet the effects of JNK activation on cardiac function and morphology have not been fully established in vivo, and the role of JNK signaling in different aspects of cardiac remodeling during heart failure remains unclear. We have previously linked JNK activation to a specific aspect of pathological cardiac remodeling, stress-induced down-regulation of the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) (11Petrich B.G. Gong X. Lerner D.L. Wang X. Brown J.H. Saffitz J.E. Wang Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Loss of gap junctions is a common feature of the failing heart (12Barker R.J. Gourdie R.G. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to contribute importantly to arrythmogenesis (13Gutstein D.E. Morley G.E. Tamaddon H. Vaidya D. Schneider M.D. Chen J. Chien K.R. Stuhlmann H. Fishman G.I. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In this report, we examined the specificity of JNK-induced intercalated disc remodeling for Cx43 and demonstrated the functional effects of JNK-induced loss of Cx43 expression on action potential propagation in the intact heart. Efforts to establish transgenic animals with targeted activation of the JNK pathway in heart were complicated by difficulty in generating stable transgenic lines due to severe cardiac phenotypes that resulted in premature death (14Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Tymitz K.M. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Jones S.P. Lefer D.J. Peng C.-F. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6341-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). To avoid such obstacles, we employed a Cre/loxP-mediated gene switch strategy, which we had used successfully to study p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (15Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.-P. Kass D.A. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and Ras (16Zheng M. Dilly K. Santos Cruz J.D. Gu Y. Ursitti J.A. Li M. Chen J. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Lederer J.W. Wang Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H424-H433Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to target expression of MKK7D, a constutively active MKK7 mutant, in ventricular myocytes. MKK7 can activate all three known JNK isoforms (17Fleming Y. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N. Paterson A. Goedert M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), with JNK1 and JNK2 the highly expressed isoforms in heart (10Liang Q. Bueno O.F. Wilkins B.J. Kuan C.-Y. Xia Y. Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5079-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A. Cavanagh J. Sluss H. Derijard B. Davis R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). This unique animal model allowed us to perform a comprehensive analysis at morphological, molecular, and functional levels. Contrary to previous reports in cultured cardiac myocytes, our results demonstrated that JNK activation is not sufficient to induce hypertrophy or cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo. Instead, activation of JNK leads to myocardial remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and gap junctions that results in a loss of ventricular wall compliance and a significant decrease in epicardial conduction velocity. This in vivo evidence suggests that JNK signaling may play a vital role in mediating specific aspects of pathological remodeling associated with heart failure. Generation of Transgenic Animals—The cloning of an α-myosin heavy chain-flox-MKK7D construct and the Cre-mediated removal of GFP (gene-switch) have been described previously (11Petrich B.G. Gong X.

Briefly, the cDNA fragment encoding human mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase D (MKK7D) (Ser271 and Thr275 to Asp) mutant was inserted into the pflox vector (6Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Transgenic animals harboring the floxed-MKK7D transgene were identified by Southern blots and PCR as described (15Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.-P. Kass D.A. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and colonies were established in a Blackswiss background. The floxed-MKK7D mice were then bred with mice possessing the gene coding for Cre recombinase under the regulation of the myosin light chain-2v promoter (MLC-2v/Cre) (19Chen J. Kubalak S.W.

The GFP-expressing floxed-MKK7D and Cre-expressing MLC-2v/Cre mice have no detectable abnormal cardiac phenotype (20Minamisawa S. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10066-10070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 2B. Petrich, unpublished results. The double transgenic offspring (MKK7D) of the floxed-MKK7D mice and MLC-2v/Cre mice were identified by PCR from tail DNA as described previously (15Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.-P. Kass D.A. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and were analyzed between 6 and 8 weeks after birth using age/sex-matched littermates with genotypes of floxed-MKK7D, MLC-2v/Cre, and wild type as controls. Protein and RNA Dot-blot Analysis—Whole hearts were excised from mice and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. To obtain protein extracts, left ventricles were pulverized on dry ice and homogenized in cell lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After 10-min microcentrifugation (10,000 rpm) at 4 °C, the supernatants were frozen on a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at -80 °C. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with antibodies against GFP (Clontech), MKK7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), p38, phospho-p38, ERK, phospho-ERK, JNK, and phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling, Inc.). These JNK and phospho-JNK antibodies are specific for p46 and p54 JNK, composed primarily of JNK1 and JNK2, respectively. Signals were detected using the Pico West System (Pierce), exposed to x-ray film, and quantified using Scion NIH Image software. RNA samples were prepared from the same heart tissues using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. RNA dot-blot analysis was performed as previously described (15Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.-P. Kass D.A. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) using a set of oligonucleotide probes (21D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn II, G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA isolated from the hearts of the animals was blotted on cellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) and hybridized with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide at various lengths that complement the coding sequence of the target mRNAs. Hybridization signals were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and were presented as relative pixel value normalized against GAPDH. Histological Analysis—Hearts were perfusion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline followed by overnight incubation in the same fixative. Hearts were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, and 6-μm-thick sections were cut. Deparaffinized and rehydrated heart sections were stained with Alexa-568-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin to outline myocyte membranes and were viewed on a Zeiss IM-35 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Spot CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Myocyte area was calculated from 15 myocytes/field from five random fields of view for each of three MKK7D and three control hearts using software supplied by the camera manufacturer. Collagen content was analyzed by picrosirius red staining of deparaffinized sections of left ventricle performed as described previously (22Dolber P.C. Spach M.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope. Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining of Cx43 and cadherins was performed using paraffin embedded sections as previously described (23Saffitz J.E. Green K.G. Kraft W.J. Schechtman K.B. Yamada K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1662-H1670PubMed Google Scholar). Double labeling of Cx43 and ZO-1, as well as fibronectin immunostaining, was performed using frozen ventricular sections as described (24Barker R.J. Price R.L. Gourdie R.G. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive signal was detected with polyclonal antibodies to fibronectin (Sigma), pan cadherin, made against the COOH-terminal amino acids of chicken N-cadherin (Sigma) or ZO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and a monoclonal Cx43 antibody (Chemicon) followed by Alexa-488 and Alexa-568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). All images were captured using identical settings on a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope. TUNEL Assay—Hearts were processed as described above for histologic analysis. TUNEL labeling was performed using an ApopTag fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit (Intergen) and following the manufacturer's protocol. Sections incubated with 10 units/ml deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma) for 10 min served as positive controls. Sections were counterstained using antifade mounting medium containing 0.5 μg/ml propidium iodide and coverslipped. Staining was viewed with a Zeiss IM-35 fluorescence microscope, and images of six random fields for each sample were captured with a Spot CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Results are presented as TUNEL-positive cells/total nuclei. Echocardiography and Hemodynamic Measurement—Noninvasive transthoracic echocardiograms were performed in 6-week-old conscious animals (Sequoia, Acuson, Mountain View, CA) as described (25Rogers J.H. Tamirisa P. Kovacs A. Weinheimer C. Courtois M. Blumer K.J. Kelly D.P. Muslin A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Wild type, MLC2v/Cre, and floxed-MKK7D transgenic mice were grouped together as controls for echocardiography, since MLC/2v/Cre and floxed-MKK7D mice have no detectable cardiac abnormalities (11Petrich B.G. Gong X. Lerner D.L. Wang X. Brown J.H. Saffitz J.E. Wang Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Minamisawa S. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10066-10070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hemodynamic measurements were obtained from five wild type controls and two MKK7D animals at 6 weeks of age. Animals were anesthetized, and hemodynamics were measured using a pressures-volumes catheter inserted into the left ventricle as previously described (15Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.-P. Kass D.A. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Microarray and Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—RNA samples from left ventricles of MKK7D transgenic and age- and sex-matched nontransgenic littermate control hearts were extracted using Trizol reagent and purified with an Rneasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Transcriptional profiling was performed using murine genome U74A version 2 GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix) exactly as previously described (26Thimmulappa R.K. Mai K.H. Srisuma S. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Biswal S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5196-5203PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed with Data Mining Tool 3.0 (Affymetrix), and differentially expressed transcripts are described by -fold change control as recommended by Affymetrix (26Thimmulappa R.K. Mai K.H. Srisuma S. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Biswal S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5196-5203PubMed Google Scholar). Data were further analyzed and grouped into functionally related groups using GenMAPP software (Gladstone Institutes) (27Dahlquist K.D. Salomonis N. Vranizan K. Lawlor S.C. Conklin B.R. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription of 5 μg of total RNA isolated from left ventricles as described above was performed using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System and supplied oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). Relative abundance of gene expression was quantified by real time RT-PCR (iCycler iQ real time PCR; Bio-Rad) using IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Primers used for real time RT-PCRs specific for transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) (28Shaddy R.E. Zhang Y.L. White W.L. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1996; 57: 10-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), TGF-β2, TGF-β3, TGF-β RII (29Rosendahl A. Checchin D. Fehniger T.E. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Sideras P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and TGF-β RI (30Chow J.F.C. Lee K.-F. Chan S.T.H. Yeung W.S.B. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously. Equal starting amounts of RNA were insured by normalizing to GAPDH using the primers GAPDH forward (5′-TCCTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′ and GAPDH reverse 5′-GATGACCTTGCCCACAGCCTTG-3′. All reactions were performed using the following parameters: 94 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 25 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. Optical Mapping—Optical mapping experiments were performed as described previously (31Eloff B.C. Lerner D.L. Yamada K.A. Schuessler R.B. Saffitz J.E. Rosenbaum D.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 51: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Conduction velocity was measured by averaging local velocity vectors from contiguous sites transverse and longitudinal to cardiac fibers. Action potential duration (APD) was measured as the time of activation to 70% repolarization, and action potential rise time was corrected for optical blurring as described previously (32Girouard S.D. Laurita K.R. Rosenbaum D.S. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1996; 7: 1024-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's paired two-tailed t test with a p value of <0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Cardiac Pathology Induced by Targeted Activation of JNK in Ventricular Myocytes in Vivo—A transgenic model with targeted activation of JNK in ventricular myocytes was established using a Cre/loxP-mediated gene switch approach as described (11Petrich B.G. Gong X. Lerner D.L. Wang X. Brown J.H. Saffitz J.E. Wang Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Double transgenic offspring (MKK7D) had diminished GFP expression and induction of MKK7D expression in the ventricles as a result of Cre-mediated DNA recombination (Fig. 1A). MKK7D expression led to activation of both p46 (primarily JNK1) and p54 (primarily JNK2) as determined by immunoblotting with a phospho-JNK antibody, whereas total JNK protein levels remained unchanged in MKK7D hearts compared with controls (Fig. 1B). Using total and phosphospecific antibodies against p38 and ERK, we also demonstrated the specificity of MKK7D for activating JNK in vivo without significant activation of p38 or ERK activities (Fig. 1B). MKK7D mice died ∼7 weeks after birth with signs of congestive heart failure, including increased lung weight/body weight ratio (Table I), ascites, dyspnea, and lethargy (Supplemental Fig. 1). Cardiac morphology of MKK7D transgenic hearts was characterized by an enlargement of both left and right atria (Fig. 2A). Although MKK7D mice had a modest reduction in ventricular mass compared with controls, the difference was not statistically significant when normalized to body weight (Table I). The cross-sectional area of ventricular myocytes from JNK-activated hearts was also unchanged compared with controls (210 ± 70 μm2 (MKK7D) versus 206 ± 71 (control) μm2, p > 0.5, Fig. 2B). Marker genes associated with hypertrophy and heart failure were induced, including atrial natriuretic factor, and the characteristic α- to β-myosin heavy chain isoform switch (Fig. 2C). To assess possible cardiomyocyte apoptosis in response to JNK activation, TUNEL staining was performed on sections of MKK7D left ventricle. The number of apoptotic nuclei in JNK-activated heart was similar to that in controls (Fig. 3), consistent with the modest decreases in ventricle wall thickness and lack of detectable replacement fibrosis in MKK7D hearts (see below) (Table II and Fig. 4). These results suggest that JNK activation is not sufficient to induce apoptosis in vivo. Together, our findings indicate that activation of JNK in ventricular myocytes in vivo leads to phenotypic changes characteristic of congestive heart failure in the absence of ventricular hypertrophy or apoptosis.Table IHeart and lung weights in MKK7D versus control miceControlMKK7DBWaBW, body weight.

https://openalex.org/W2074518940,"Calcineurin is a calcium-dependent, serine/threonine phosphatase that functions as a signaling intermediate. In this study, we investigated the role of calcineurin in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-mediated cellular effects and examined the signaling pathway involved in activation of calcineurin. Calcineurin is activated by TGF-β in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Consistent with increased phosphatase activity, the calcineurin substrate, NFATc1, is dephosphorylated and transported to the nucleus. Inhibition of calcineurin prior to the addition of TGF-β revealed that calcineurin is required for TGF-β-mediated accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins but not cell hypertrophy. Conversely, overexpression of constitutively active calcineurin was sufficient to induce ECM protein expression. The mechanism of calcineurin activation by TGF-β was found to be induction of a low, sustained increase of intracellular calcium. Chelation of extracellular calcium blocked both TGF-β-mediated calcium influx and calcineurin activity. Finally, calcium entry was found to be dependent upon generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Accordingly, inhibition of ROS generation also blocked TGF-β-mediated calcineurin phosphatase activity and decreased ECM accumulation. In conclusion, this study describes a new pathway for TGF-β-mediated regulation of ECM via generation of ROS, calcium influx, and activation of calcineurin.

Although many of the effects of TGF-β may be attributed to signaling via the Smad pathway, recent findings indicate that cell-specific action of TGF-β may be due to activation of other signaling pathways that are parallel to Smads or perhaps participate in cross-talk with Smad pathways. As such, there remains a great deal to be learned about mediators of TGF-β action. Specifically, Smads 2, 3, and 4 have been shown to play vital roles in TGF-β-mediated proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (review in Ref. 1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). However, the signaling mechanisms of TGF-β-mediated regulation of hypertrophy and accumulation of ECM proteins are unclear. For example, fibroblasts from Smad3 knockout mice (2Piek E. Ju W.J. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19945-19953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and cells that lack Smad4 (3Hocevar B. Brown T. Howe P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) still produce fibronectin in response to TGF-β. Thus is it reasonable to conclude that there are multiple pathways that participate in TGF-β regulation of ECM accumulation, possibly contributing to the tissue-specific effects of TGF-β.One potential signaling mechanism that may be critical for TGF-β action is activation of calcium-dependent molecules such as calcineurin. Calcineurin has been shown to be required for activation of transcription and induction of cell hypertrophy in a number of cell types including cardiac myocytes (4Palmer S. Groves N. Schindler A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42492-42500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, calcineurin is implicated in the regulation of collagen transcription factor-1 (8Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Ruegg U. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23597-23605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of TGF-β blocks increased ECM protein accumulation in the kidney caused by calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 (9Islam M. Burke J.F. McGowan T.A. Zhu Y. Dun S.R. McCue P. Kanalas J. Sharma K. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 498-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because two important functions of TGF-β are induction of cell hypertrophy and regulation of ECM accumulation, these findings support a potential role for calcineurin in TGF-β signal transduction. However, a direct role for calcineurin in TGF-β action has not been demonstrated.Calcineurin is a calcium-dependent signaling protein, but there is not yet a thorough understanding of how calcium contributes to TGF-β signaling and action or the mechanism of calcium modulation. TGF-β has been reported both to increase intracellular calcium (10Ishiyama N. Shibata H. Kanzaki M. Shiozaki S. Miyazaki J.-I. Kobayashi I. Kojima I. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1996; 117: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11McGowan T.A. Madesh M. Zhu Y. Wang L. Russo M. Deelman L. Henning R. Joseph S. Hajnoczky G. Sharma K. Am. J.

Kaspar V. Szalai G. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F1022-F1029PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, TGF-β has been shown to induce generation of ROS such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide in a variety of cell types (13Herrera B. Alvarez A.M. Sanchez A. Fernandez M. Roncero C.

Lee K.N. Ju H.R. Han S.H. Iml J.Y. Kang H.S. Lee T.H. Bae Y.S. Ha K.S. Lee Z.W. Rhee S.G. Choi I. J. Immunol. 2000; 22: 2190-2197Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, in some cells, TGF-β is shown to have no effect (21Tudor K. Hess K. Cook-Mills J. Cytokine. 2001; 15: 196-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or even to decrease ROS generation (22Delorme N. Remond C. Sartelet H. Petitfrere E. Clement C. Schneider C. Bellon G. Virion A. Haye B. Martiny L. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 173: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, generation of ROS has been linked to increased fibronectin expression and collagen mRNA accumulation in a TGF-β-dependent manner (23Ha H. Lee H. Kidney Int. 2000; 77 (suppl.): S19-S25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 24Iglesias-De La Cruz M. Ruiz-Torres P. Alcami J. Diez-Marques L. Ortega-Velazquez R. Chen S. Rodriguez-Puyol M. Ziyadeh F. Rodriguez-Puyol D. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), suggesting that regulation of ECM may involve ROS generation upstream and/or downstream of TGF-β action.In this study, we investigated the role of calcineurin in TGF-β effects in cultured renal cells. Upstream of calcineurin activation, we examined the effect of TGF-β on calcium mobilization and investigated the contribution of generation of ROS to TGF-β-mediated changes in calcium and activation of calcineurin. Finally, we placed generation of ROS, modulation of calcium, and activation of calcineurin together in a pathway that functions to regulate ECM proteins in renal cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRecombinant TGF-β was purchased from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Cyclosporin A, anti-fibronectin antibody, thapsagargin, nifedipine, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), diphenyleneoidonium (DPI), and ferricytochrome c were from Sigma; anti-collagen type IV antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); anti-NFATc1 and total Erk1/Erk2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and lanthanum chloride was obtained from Aldrich. wtCnA and CA-CnA constructs were a gift from P. Camacho (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX).Cell CultureRat mesangial cells were cultured from glomeruli isolated by differential sieving as previously described (25Shultz P. DeCorleto P. Silver B. Abboud H. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F674-F684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, rat mesangial cells that have been maintained in our laboratory (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX) were used between passages 26 and 32. Normal renal fibroblasts and LLCKP-1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in our laboratory in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The cells were transiently transfected by the addition of 5 μg of DNA premixed with LipofectAMINE™/10-cm cell culture plate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).Western BlotsMesangial cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and allowed to grow to 80-90% confluence. The medium was changed to SFM for 24 h, and the cells were treated as indicated. The cells were then harvested with trypsin-EDTA, pelleted, and washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The protein was extracted using TNESV lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonident P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, and 10-7m phenylmethylsulfonyl), and 25 μg of protein was analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose, the membrane was incubated in 5% milk-TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then immunoblotted with appropriate dilutions of primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).ImmunofluorescenceMesangial cells were plated in 8-well chamber slides and allowed to grow to 80-90% confluence. The medium was replaced with SFM for 24 h, and the cells were treated as indicated. Following treatment, the cells were fixed and permeabilized in 100% methanol for 5 min and then rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. The fixed cells were then blocked with donkey IgG for 15 min prior to the addition of anti-NFATc1 (15 μg/ml), an antibody that was generated against NFATc1 but has broad cross-reactivity with all four calcium-regulated NFATc proteins, for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin before the addition of Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100). Finally, the cells were washed three times for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the chambers were removed from the slides, and the coverslips were mounted with Crystal Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) for viewing by fluorescent microscopy.Calcineurin AssayCalcineurin activity was determined following the protocol published by Fruman et al. (26Fruman D.A. Pai S.-Y. Klee C.N. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 9: 146-154Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and previously described in mesangial cells (7Gooch J.L. Tang Y. Ricono J.M. Abboud H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42492-42500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells were grown to 80-90% confluence in 6-well plates, and then the medium was replaced with SFM for 24 h. The cells were then treated as indicated in triplicate and then collected for determination of calcineurin activity.ROS MeasurementsDetection of Intracellular H2O2—Mesangial cells were grown to near confluency in coverglass chambers and were made quiescent by serum deprivation for 48 h prior to treatment. The peroxide-sensitive fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used to assess the generation of intracellular H2O2 as described previously (27Gorin Y. Kim N.-H. Feliers D. Bhandari B. Ghosh-Choudhury G. Abboud H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). H2O2 production was also determined by Amplex Red Assay (Molecular Probes) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.Measurement of Superoxide Anion Production in Intact Cells—Approximately 2 × 106 mesangial cells/well were grown in six-well plates until 80-90% confluent. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated as indicated. The measurement of superoxide anion ( O2·¯) released into the medium by mesangial cells was performed by detection of ferricytochrome c reduction as described (28Johnston R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Measurement of Intracellular CalciumChanges of [Ca2+]i in mesangial cells were determined in cell suspensions using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2/AM as previously described (29Zhang B.-X. Ma X. Yeh C.-K. Lifschitz M. Zhu M. Katz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48165-48171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, mesangial cells grown to 80-90% confluence were harvested by trypsin-EDTA and loaded in PSS buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with 1 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) in the dark at 37 °C with gentle agitation for 30 min. Loaded cells were washed and resuspended in fresh PSS solution supplemented with high calcium (1.2 mm). The [Ca2+]i signals were measured in suspension of fura-2/AM-loaded cells at a density of 2.5-5 × 10-5 cells/ml at 37 °C. The excitation ratio of 340/380 was analyzed with a Delta Scan spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International Inc., South Brunswick, NJ) using 340- and 380-nm wavelengths for excitation and 510 nm for emission. Changes in [Ca2+]i were measured and indexed by the alterations in the fluorescence ratio of 340/380.RESULTSCalcineurin Is Activated by TGF-β and Is Required for ECM Accumulation—Calcineurin is a calcium-dependent, serine/threonine phosphatase that may be involved in TGF-β effects in the kidney. Therefore, we examined calcineurin activity using a previously described in vitro phosphatase assay (see “Experimental Procedures”) in response to TGF-β in cultured rat mesangial cells. Fig. 1 shows that treatment of cells with TGF-β increases calcineurin activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Maximum activity is seen between 2 and 5 min, with basal levels of activity restored by 20 min. Pretreatment of cells with CsA, a specific inhibitor of calcineurin, lowers the basal levels of activity and completely abolishes TGF-β-mediated activation of calcineurin. Increased activity was seen with as little as 0.1 ng/ml, and maximal stimulation was achieved with ∼2 ng/ml. In addition to short term activation of phosphatase activity, increased expression of calcineurin was observed 24 and 48 h after the addition of TGF-β (Fig. 1C). The mechanism by which long term exposure to TGF-β increases calcineurin expression may be due to enhanced transcription or protein stabilization. Increased expression of calcineurin is dependent upon early induction of calcineurin activity because pretreatment with CsA blocked TGF-β-mediated increase of the protein (Fig. 1D).NFATc proteins, which are basally phosphorylated and localized to the cytoplasm, are substrates of calcineurin (30Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Following dephosphorylation by calcineurin, NFATc proteins translocate to the nucleus and interact with other transcription factors to alter gene transcription. Therefore, NFATc phosphorylation and cellular localization was determined following TGF-β treatment to demonstrate calcineurin activity in vivo. Consistent with early activation of calcineurin, 15 min following the addition of TGF-β, there is a marked increase in dephosphorylated calcineurin, evident as a faster migrating band on an SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1E). In addition, there is a marked increase in the nuclear localization of NFATc, which is completely blocked in cells pretreated with CsA (Fig. 1F). It is of interest that cyclosporin treatment also reduced the abundance of NFATc protein both in control and TGF-β-treated cells.TGF-β is a potent mediator of cell hypertrophy (7Gooch J.L. Tang Y. Ricono J.M. Abboud H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42492-42500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Choi M. Eung-Gook K. Ballerman B. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 948-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins (32Nakamura T. Okuda S. Ruoslahti E. Border W.A. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 1213-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Ziyadeh F.N. Sharma K. Ericksen M. Wolf G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of calcineurin in TGF-β-mediated hypertrophy and ECM accumulation was determined in cultured mesangial cells. First, mesangial cell protein synthesis was determined by incorporation of 3H-leucine as previously described (34Jaimes E.A. Galceran J.M. Raij L. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 775-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) as a marker of cell hypertrophy. Fig. 2A shows that TGF-β treatment results in increased cell hypertrophy, which is unaffected by inhibition of calcineurin with CsA. As a control, cells were also treated with IGF-I, which has previously been shown to induce cell hypertrophy via calcineurin (5Miyashita T. Takeishi Y. Takahashi H. Kato S. Kubota I. Tomoike H. Jpn. Circ. J. 2001; 65: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Gooch J.L. Tang Y. Ricono J.M. Abboud H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42492-42500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Musaro A. McCullagh K.J. Naya F.J. Olsen E.N. Rosenthal N.

CsA blocks IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy, as expected, but had no effect on TGF-β-mediated cell hypertrophy. The combination of IGF-I and TGF-β produced an additive hypertrophic effect. Consistent with activation of independent pathways, CsA treatment only resulted in a small decrease in the combined effect of IGF-I plus TGF-β. Next, the role of calcineurin in TGF-β-mediated accumulation of ECM proteins was determined. Fig. 2B shows that the addition of TGF-β markedly increases expression of both fibronectin and collagen type IV. CsA alone has no effect on levels of fibronectin or collagen type IV, but pretreatment of cells with CsA is sufficient to reduce accumulation of ECM proteins. Finally, transient expression of a constitutively active calcineurin construct (CA-CnA), and to a lesser extent wild type calcineurin (wtCnA), induces fibronectin expression (Fig. 2C) compared with vector alone. Furthermore, pretreatment with CsA inhibited ECM expression resulting from overexpression of CA-CnA and wtCnA.Fig. 2Calcineurin is required for TGF-β-mediated extracellular matrix accumulation but not hypertrophy. A, mesangial cells were pretreated with SFM or CsA (2.5 μm) for 30 min and then stimulated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml), IGF-I (10-ng/ml), or TGF-β + IGF-I for 48 h. 3H-Leucine was added for the final 6 h of treatment, and then the cells were lysed, proteins were precipitated, and incorporated 3H-leucine was measured in a scintillation counter. The bars represent the means of quadruplicate samples ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 compared with control. B, mesangial cells were pretreated with SFM or CsA (2.5 μm) for 30 min and then stimulated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 72 h. The cells were lysed, and the total protein was collected. Fibronectin and collage type IV proteins were determined by direct immunoblotting (IB) with specific antibodies. The data were semi-quantitated, and the results are expressed as the means ± S.E. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 compared with control. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments. C, vector, constitutively active calcineurin (CA-CnA), and wild type calcineurin (wtCnA) were transiently over expressed in cultured mesangial cells in the presence or absence of CsA (2.5 μm). The cell lysates were collected, and fibronectin protein expression was determined by Western blot. Erk1/2 was detected by immunoblotting to ensure equal loading. Fibronectin expression was increased in cells expressing constitutively active and to a lesser extent wild type calcineurin but not vector alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Calcineurin Is Activated by Extracellular Calcium—Calcineurin is a calcium-dependent phosphatase, but it is not clear what effect TGF-β has on intracellular calcium in mesangial cells. Calcium influx ([Ca2+]i) was measured in primary rat mesangial cells loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2/AM as the ratio of excitation at 340- and 380-nm wavelengths. Fig. 3A shows that the addition of TGF-β at 2 and 10 ng/ml stimulates a slow, sustained increase in calcium that persists up to 10 min. Furthermore, TGF-β-mediated alterations in calcium are completely blocked by chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA. Fig. 3B confirms that calcineurin activation by TGF-β is dependent upon entry of extracellular calcium because EGTA also blocks calcineurin activity. As a control, the cells were treated with calcium ionophore, which increased TGF-β-mediated calcineurin activity as expected, and CsA, which abolished TGF-β-mediated activation of calcineurin. Finally, Fig. 3C demonstrates that TGF-β-mediated NFATc1 nuclear localization is also dependent upon influx of extracellular calcium. Chelation of calcium with the addition of EGTA blocked NFATc1 translocation following TGF-β treatment. As expected, the addition of ionophore alone was sufficient to induce nuclear translocation, and CsA caused cytoplasmic retention of NFATc1.Fig. 3Calcineurin is activated by a small, sustained increase in calcium. A, mesangial cells were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2/AM and then treated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml or 10 ng/ml). [Ca2+]i was measured as the ratio of excitation and emission at 335-nm/505-nm wavelengths, respectively. In the lower tracing, mesangial cells were pretreated with EGTA for 2 min prior to the addition of TGF-β (2 ng/ml). B, mesangial cells were pretreated with CsA (2.5 μm), calcium ionophore (1 μm), or EGTA for 10 min and then stimulated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 2.5 min. Calcineurin activity was determined by in vitro phosphatase assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). The bars represent the means of triplicate assays ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 compared with control. C, mesangial cells were grown on a chamber slide and pretreated with CsA (2.5 μm), calcium ionophore (1 μm), or EGTA for 10 min and then stimulated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 15 min. NFATc1 cellular localization was determined by immunofluorescence using a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the mechanism of TGF-β-mediated [Ca2+]i, the cells were stimulated with ATP after 5 min of TGF-β treatment. ATP induces a rapid increase of [Ca2+]i, indicating that intracellular calcium stores remain intact following TGF-β treatment (Fig. 4A). Next, the cells were pretreated with thapsagargin for 10 min to deplete intracellular stores prior to the addition of TGF-β (Fig. 4B). TGF-β treatment stimulates increased ([Ca2+]i) even after depletion of intracellular stores, further indicating that TGF-β-mediated calcium influx is independent of intracellular calcium stores. Finally, the role of two possible calcium channels in TGF-β-mediated [Ca2+]i were investigated. First, the cells were pretreated with nifedipine, a specific inhibitor of L-type calcium channels prior to the addition of TGF-β (Fig. 4C). Second, the cells were pretreated with an inhibitor of store-operated calcium channels, lanthanum chloride, before stimulation with TGF-β (Fig. 4D). TGF-β induces a consistent [Ca2+]i in the presence of both inhibitors, suggesting that neither L-type calcium channels or store-operated calcium channels are involved in TGF-β-mediated [Ca2+]i.Fig. 4TGF-β-mediated [Ca2+]i is from an extracellular source. A, mesangial cells were loaded with the florescent calcium indicator fura-2/AM, and [Ca2+]i was measured as the ratio of excitation and emission at 335-nm/505-nm wavelengths, respectively. The cells were first treated with 2 ng/ml TGF-β followed by ATP. B, mesangial cells were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2/AM and then pretreated with thapsargargin before the addition of TGF-β (2 ng/ml). [Ca2+]i was measured as the ratio of excitation and emission at 335-nm/505-nm wavelengths, respectively. C, mesangial cells were pretreated with nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, for 10 min prior to the addition of TGF-β (2 ng/ml). [Ca2+]i was measure for 5 min. D, mesangial cells were pretreated with lanthanum chloride, an inhibitor of store-operated calcium channels, for 10 min prior to the addition of TGF-β (2 ng/ml). [Ca2+]i was measured for 5 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TGF-β Increases Cellular Calcium via Generation of ROS—TGF-β has been shown to induce generation of ROS including superoxide anion ( O2·¯) and H2O2, which may participate in TGF-β signal transduction as signaling second messengers (15Thannickal V.J.

https://openalex.org/W2069854015,"We have conducted an analysis of genetic alterations in spontaneous murine melanoma cell line B16F0 and its two metastatic clones, B16F1 and B16F10 and the carcinogen-induced murine melanoma cell lines CM519, CM3205, and K1735. We found that unlike human melanomas, the murine melanoma cell lines did not have activating mutations in the Braf oncogene at exon 11 or 15. However, there were distinct patterns of alterations in the ras, Ink4a/Arf, and p53 genes in the two melanoma groups. In the spontaneous B16 melanoma cell lines, expression of p16Ink4a and p19Arf tumor suppressor proteins was lost as a consequence of a large deletion spanning Ink4a/Arf exons 1α, 1β, and 2. In contrast, the carcinogen-induced melanoma cell lines expressed p16Ink4a but had inactivating mutations in either p19Arf (K1735) or p53 (CM519 and CM3205). Inactivation of p19Arf or p53 in carcinogen-induced melanomas was accompanied by constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and/or mutation-associated activation of N-ras. These results indicate that genetic alterations in p16Ink4a/p19Arf, p53 and ras-MAPK pathways can cooperate in the development of murine melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2149288191,"RUNX3, a Runt domain transcription factor involved in TGF-beta signaling, is a candidate tumor-suppressor gene localized in 1p36, a region commonly deleted in a wide variety of human tumors, including those of the stomach, bile duct, and pancreas. Recently, frequent inactivation of RUNX3 has been demonstrated in human gastric carcinomas. In this study, to examine the involvement of RUNX3 abnormalities in tumorigenesis of bile duct as well as pancreatic cancers, we investigated not only the expression but also methylation status of RUNX3 in 10 human bile duct and 12 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Seven (70%) of the bile duct and nine (75%) of the pancreatic cancer cell lines exhibited no expression of RUNX3 by both Northern blot analysis and the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. All of the 16 cell lines that did not express RUNX3 also showed methylation of the promoter CpG island of the gene, whereas the six cell lines that showed RUNX3 expression were not methylated or only partially methylated in the RUNX3 promoter region. Moreover, treatment with the methylation inhibitor 5'-aza-2'-deoxycitidine activated RUNX3 mRNA expression in all of 16 cancer cell lines that originally lacked RUNX3 expression. Finally, hemizygous deletion of RUNX3, as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization, was found in 15 of the 16 cancer cell lines that lacked RUNX3 expression. These data suggest that the inactivation of RUNX3 plays an important role in bile duct and pancreatic carcinogenesis, and that methylation is a common mechanism by which the gene is inactivated."

Upstream components of the proline biosynthesis signal transduction pathways are still poorly defined. We provide experimental evidence that phospholipase D (PLD) is involved in the regulation of proline metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. The application of primary butyl alcohols, which divert part of PLD-derived phosphatidic acid by transphosphatidylation, stimulated proline biosynthesis even without hyperosmotic constraints. Moreover, application of primary butyl alcohols enhanced the proline responsiveness of seedlings to mild hyperosmotic stress. These data indicate that some PLDs are negative regulators of proline biosynthesis and that plants present a higher proline responsiveness to hyperosmotic stress when this regulator is abolished. We clearly demonstrate that PLD signaling for proline biosynthesis is similar to RD29A gene expression and different from the abscisic acid-dependent RAB18 gene expression. Our data reveal that PLDs play positive and negative roles in hyperosmotic stress signal transduction in plants, contributing to a precise regulation of ion homeostasis and plant salt tolerance.

Our data reveal that PLDs play positive and negative roles in hyperosmotic stress signal transduction in plants, contributing to a precise regulation of ion homeostasis and plant salt tolerance. Accumulating evidence suggests a major role for phospholipids to serve as precursors for the generation of secondary messengers in animal and plant cell transduction pathways. Recent reports have indicated that phospholipase D (PLD) 1The abbreviations used are: PLD, phospholipase D; ABA, abscisic acid; PA, phosphatidic acid; PBut, phosphatidylbutanol; P5C, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate; P5CS, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase; ProDH, proline dehydrogenase; OAT, ornithine-δ-aminotransferase. is also involved in water stress signaling through the hydrolysis of phospholipids to generate phosphatidic acid (PA) and free head groups. Water deficit triggers PLD activity and promotes stomatal closing and more recently it was shown that PLD activation mediates ABA signal transduction cascades (1Jacob T. Ritchie S. Assmann S.M.

Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Twelve PLD genes were identified in the Arabidopsis genome and tentatively grouped into five classes based on sequence similarity and biochemical properties (5Quin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Biochemical requirements of these different plant PLDs, particularly for Ca2+ concentration, pH, and substrate lipids, clearly showed distinct features, suggesting different metabolic and physiological functions in plants. Drought and high salinity are common environmental stresses that affect plant growth and crop productivity (6Boyer J.S. Science. 1982; 218: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2901) Google Scholar). They both produce osmotic stress by decreasing the chemical activity of water and leading to a loss of cell turgor. The presence of salt has an additional effect causing ion toxicity because high intracellular concentration of sodium is deleterious to cellular metabolism (7Serrano R. Gaxiola R. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1994; 13: 121-138Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Plants are sessile organisms, and their survival in a changing environment requires rapid responses to adverse conditions. Water deficit begins with stress perception, which initiates signal transduction pathway(s) to trigger a complex set of adaptive responses. Both drought and salt stresses stimulate the accumulation of compatible solutes that include ions such as K+ or organic compounds such as sucrose, betaines, and proline in the cytosol as a protective mechanism. Accumulation of proline is a wide-spread plant response to environmental stresses, and proline is thought to play a role in the adaptive response (8Delauney J.A. Verma D.P.D. Plant J. 1993; 4: 215-223Crossref Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). The significance of proline accumulation in osmotic adjustment and tolerance is still a matter of debate, and recently, the proline metabolism intermediate pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) was suggested to be highly toxic to the cell by either directly or indirectly triggering apoptosis (9Deuschle K. Funck D. Hellmann H. Daschner K. Binder S. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2001; 27: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Proline has also been proposed to serve as a scavenger of radicals, a transient storage of nitrogen, and a source of redox equivalent (10Hare P.D. Cress W.A. Van Staden J. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 413-434Google Scholar). Higher plants synthesize proline via two different pathways. The first pathway is from glutamate that is converted to P5C by Δ 1The abbreviations used are: PLD, phospholipase D; ABA, abscisic acid; PA, phosphatidic acid; PBut, phosphatidylbutanol; P5C, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate; P5CS, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase; ProDH, proline dehydrogenase; OAT, ornithine-δ-aminotransferase.-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) catalyzing the rate-limiting step in proline biosynthesis upon osmotic stress conditions (11Szoke A.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). P5C is then reduced to proline by Δ 1The abbreviations used are: PLD, phospholipase D; ABA, abscisic acid; PA, phosphatidic acid; PBut, phosphatidylbutanol; P5C, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate; P5CS, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase; ProDH, proline dehydrogenase; OAT, ornithine-δ-aminotransferase.-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase. The second pathway is from ornithine that is transformed to P5C through δ-transamination by ornithine-δ-aminotransferase (OAT), and P5C is subsequently reduced to proline. Upon relief from hyperosmotic stress, proline is rapidly degraded by the sequential action of the mitochondrial enzymes proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) and P5C dehydrogenase. Genes encoding enzymes catalyzing proline biosynthesis and degradation have been cloned from various plant species. Strong positive correlation between P5CS transcript and proline levels have been abundantly reported (10Hare P.D. Cress W.A. Van Staden J. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 413-434Google Scholar) with a reciprocal transcriptional regulation between P5CS and ProDH genes upon and after hyperosmotic stress (13Verbruggen N. Hua X.J. May M. Van Montagu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 14Kiyosue T. Yoshiba Y. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K.

Among factors involved in the regulation of proline metabolism, ABA and calcium were previously shown to play an important role (10Hare P.D. Cress W.A. Van Staden J. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 413-434Google Scholar). ABA-dependent and independent signaling cascades have been identified between the initial water stress signal and the expression of drought-responsive genes like genes involved in proline biosynthesis, RAB18 and RD29A (16Savouré A. Hua X.J. Bertauche N. Van Montagu M. Verbruggen N. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 18Lang V. Palva E.T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The two pathways may interact and converge because genes like RD29A possess an ABRE-responsive complex mediating ABA regulation and a dehydration-responsive element that can be activated by osmotic stress but not by ABA (19Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Calcium also plays a role as a signaling molecule in a number of responses to drought and salinity. Water and salt stresses have been shown to induce transient free Ca2+ cytosolic waves derived from either influx from the apoplastic space or release from internal stores. Using Arabidopsis plants expressing cytosolic aequorin, calcium was shown to be necessary but not sufficient for drought and salt induction of P5CS, indicating that an additional signaling factor is involved (20Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1067-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the proline accumulation in the adaptive response of plants to osmotic stress and in contrast to metabolic events involved in proline accumulation, the signaling cascades regulating proline metabolism are still poorly characterized. In this report, we describe how PLD negatively regulates the proline biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis. We also show that calcium is involved in proline biosynthesis during osmotic stress and provide molecular evidence that this signaling cascade is different from the ABA-dependent pathway. Plant Material—Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. ecotype Columbia seeds were surface-sterilized and grown on 0.5× Murashige-Skoog (MS) agar medium (21Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (54339) Google Scholar) in 14-cm-diameter Petri dishes as previously described (22Verbruggen N. Villarroel R. Van Montagu M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After an overnight period at 4 °C to raise dormancy, the seedlings were placed under continuous illumination with 45 μmol of photons·m–2·s–1 at 22 °C for 12 days. Hyperosmotic Stress and Inhibitory Treatments—Twelve-day-old seedlings were removed from 0.5× MS agar plates and put onto a liquid 0.5× MS medium supplemented with different butanol isomers, verapamil, or EGTA or with water as control for 1 h. Then an equal volume of water, NaCl (200 mm), or mannitol (400 mm) was added to the medium. When plants were treated with 1-butanol (0.5% v/v) and calcium (10 or 50 mm) or with both 1-butanol (0.5% v/v) and potassium (10 or 50 mm), no pretreatment was made. After different incubation times, the seedlings were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C prior to analysis. In Vivo Phospholipase D Activity—Phospholipids were metabolically labeled by incubating 12-day-old seedlings for 24 h in [33P]orthophosphate (53 MBq·liter–1). Primary butyl alcohols were then added to the medium supplemented with NaCl or mannitol to measure PLD activity by transphosphatidylation through phosphatidylbutanol (PBut) formation. The incubations were stopped by immersing seedlings in boiling water for 5 min. The lipids were then extracted and separated as described by Refs. 4Hallouin M. Ghelis T. Brault M. Bardat F. Cornel D. Miginiac E. Rona J.P. Sotta B. Jeannette E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 23Munnik T. Arisz S.A. de Vrije T. Musgrave A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2197-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, respectively. Radiolabeled PA and PBut were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). PLD activity is presented as the formation of [33P]PBut counts, which is expressed as the percentage compared with nonstressed control plants. The means were compared using analyses of variance followed by protected t tests with the LSMEANS instruction of the SAS GLM procedure. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from seedlings harvested in liquid nitrogen by the guanidinium thiocyanate-CsCl purification method (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 4.2.1-4.2.6Google Scholar). RNA samples were denatured and separated by electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel. After transfer to nylon membrane, the RNAs were fixed by UV cross-linking. The membranes were hybridized at 65 °C with either specific 3′-untranslated regions of AtP5CS1, AtP5CS2, or RD29A or with full length of At-δOAT, ProDH, or RAB18 according to Ref. 25Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar. The fragments were labeled with [32P]dCTP using Ready-To-Go™ DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). Before hybridization, the membranes were stained with methylene blue as a control for RNA loading. The hybridization signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Gel Electrophoresis, Electroblotting, and Immunological Detection— The proteins were extracted as described (26Martinez-Garcia J.F. Monte E. Quail P.H. Plant J. 1999; 20: 251-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose filter in a solution of 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.04% (w/v) SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol at 50 mA for 1 h. For immunodetection, the nitrocellulose filter was incubated in TBS (TBS-T) with 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and then in TBS-T with 0.1% (v/v) rabbit antiserum for 16 h at room temperature. The antisera were obtained by immunization of rabbits with the following proteins: AtP5CS1 (amino acids 5–717), AtProDH (amino acids 1–522), and AtδOAT (amino acids 52–474). The blots were washed with TBS-T. Detection was performed with an ECL assay using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Equal protein loading and integrity of protein samples were verified by Ponceau S red staining of the blot membrane. Proline Determination—Free proline content was measured using l-proline as standard according to Ref. 28Bates L.S. Waldren R.P. Teare I.D. Plant Soil. 1973; 39: 205-207Crossref Scopus (13285) Google Scholar. Primary Butanol Triggers Proline Accumulation—Recently, PLDs were shown to be involved in drought signaling (29Munnik T. Meijer H.J. Ter Riet B. Hirt H. Frank W. Bartels D. Musgrave A. Plant J. 2000; 22: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Katagiri T. Takahashi S. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2001; 26: 595-605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reinforcing the need to investigate their putative role in the regulation of proline metabolism. PLD readily transfers the phosphatidyl moiety of a phospholipid to a primary alcohol rather than water producing PBut at the expense of PA, and because PBut is an inactive lipid formed, butanol treatment will inhibit PA signaling from PLD. Using this tool, we investigated the implication of PLDs in water stress-induced proline accumulation in A. thaliana. In response to 24-h treatments with either 200 mm NaCl or 400 mm mannitol, proline was accumulated to 2.5-fold compared with control in A. thaliana seedlings (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the proline level was 2-fold increased in 1-butanol-treated plants without osmoticum (Fig. 1A). sec-Butanol, an activator of G protein activity (23Munnik T. Arisz S.A. de Vrije T. Musgrave A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2197-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and ter-butanol, an inactive analogue of 1- and 2-butanol (23Munnik T. Arisz S.A. de Vrije T. Musgrave A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2197-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), did not have any effect on proline accumulation (Fig. 1A). To analyze the biological function of PLD in Arabidopsis, PLD activity was measured by transphosphatidylation reactions in the presence of primary butyl alcohols. The seedlings were incubated with 33P for 24 h to label structural phospholipids and subsequently treated with NaCl or mannitol. Lipids were then extracted and separated by TLC. Because PBut was formed after the addition of 1-butanol, the amount of PBut reflects a cumulative PLD activity under each treatment. The PA level was higher in seedlings upon hyperosmotic stresses compared with control plants, suggesting a higher PLD activity in stress conditions (Fig. 2). When 1-butanol was added, PBut was formed at the expense of PA upon normal growth as well as in hyperosmotic stress conditions. A lower PLD activity was present in seedlings grown in control medium than with NaCl and mannitol because PBut levels were increased by 2.5- and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with control. In contrast, the increase in PBut formation was not accompanied by a significant decrease in PA formation, suggesting a low impact of the activated PLDs to this PA pool. The fact that 1-butanol stimulated proline accumulation could result from an activation of PLD by 1-butanol or through a diminution of PA signaling from PLDs. Therefore, the effect of different concentrations of 1-butanol was analyzed on proline and PBut levels (Fig. 3). Accumulation of proline increased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of low 1-butanol concentrations with a maximum at 0.5%. Interestingly 1-butanol concentration above 0.75% diminished proline to lower levels than control. This result contrasted with PBut levels that strongly increased with 1-butanol concentrations above 0.5%, suggesting a stimulation of PLDs by primary alcohol as already reported by 23. We concluded, therefore, that stimulation of proline by 1-butanol was not due to an increase in PLD activity but rather to inhibition of a negative regulation by specific PLDs.Fig. 2In vivo PLD activity in Arabidopsis seedlings in response to various treatments. The seedlings were labeled with 33P for 24 h and then treated with or without (control) 200 mm NaCl or 400 mm mannitol in the presence or absence of 0.5% 1-butanol. The lipids were extracted, separated by TLC, and quantified by phosphorimaging as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, representative autoradiography from a TLC plate after separation of phospholipids from seedlings treated with or without NaCl or mannitol. The position of PBut, PA, and structural phospholipids are indicated. B, quantification of PA and PBut levels by PhosphorImager. The values are the means of four independent treatments. The results for the PA and PBut are expressed as percentages with respect to nonstressed control seedlings. Based on variance analyses, NaCl and mannitol stresses had a significant effect on PA and PBut levels compared with control (p < 0.05), although 1-butanol did not affect PA level compared with the corresponding control, whatever the treatment (p < 0.05). 1-But, 1-butanol; SPL, structural phospholipids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Proline and PBut formation are stimulated by 1-butanol in a different dose-dependent manner. The seedlings were prepared as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The proline (A) and PBut (B) levels were measured in seedlings treated with different concentrations of 1-butanol for 24 h. The results are shown as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. FW, fresh weight; 1-But, 1-butanol; AU, arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Molecular Analysis of Hyperosmotic Stress-responsive Genes—Next we investigated the effect of 1-butanol on three markers of proline biosynthesis, namely AtP5CS1, AtP5CS2, and OAT, and one marker of proline catabolism, ProDH. AtP5CS1, OAT, and ProDH transcript levels were increased by hyperosmotic treatments with different kinetics (Fig. 1B). AtP5CS1 transcript level was higher 3 h after treatment with either 200 mm NaCl or 400 mm mannitol than it was after 24 h. In contrast, OAT transcript level peaked at 24 h, whatever the treatment. Interestingly, we also observed a significant increased of ProDH RNA level after a 24-h NaCl treatment and to a lesser extent after a 24-h mannitol treatment. Under the same experimental conditions, the AtP5CS2 transcript level did not show any variation, whatever the treatment (data not shown). Application of 1-butanol without osmoticum increased AtP5CS1transcript levels by 1.5-fold after 3 h and over 3-fold after 24 h (Fig. 1B). In NaCl- or mannitol-treated plants, 1-butanol increased AtP5CS1 and OAT transcript levels at 24 h. A slight decrease in P5CS1 transcript level was always observed at 3 h in the presence of 1-butanol, indicating that other PLDs may be partially involved in short time responses. In contrast to NaCl, 1-butanol alone or together with mannitol triggered ProDH transcript accumulation at 24 h. We also investigated protein levels of P5CS, OAT, and ProDH using specific antibodies. P5CS accumulated to the same extent at 24 h of treatment with NaCl or mannitol. 1-Butanol alone triggered P5CS accumulation, although it had no clear effect on P5CS level in NaCl- or mannitol-treated plants. No significant accumulation of ProDH proteins was observed after a 24-h NaCl or mannitol treatment. Two proteins detected by the ProDH antibody were probably reflecting mature and immature forms of the enzyme that localized in mitochondria (14Kiyosue T. Yoshiba Y. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, accumulation of ProDH was observed at 24 h with 1-butanol alone or with mannitol. OAT proteins remained unchanged to a low level, whatever the treatment (data not shown). In contrast to ProDH and OAT, a positive correlation was observed between P5CS transcript and protein levels. sec- and ter-butanol did not show any effect on protein and transcript accumulation, as compared with control (data not shown), suggesting the implication of a PLD in negative regulation of proline biosynthesis in normal conditions. However, the inhibition of PA biosynthesis from PLD is apparently not sufficient to activate proline biosynthesis to the level observed during water stress. The effect of PLD on proline metabolism prompted us to investigate its role on the ABA-dependent RAB18 and ABA-independent RD29A-regulated genes. The transcript level of RAB18 was increased by NaCl and mannitol treatments at a higher level after 3 h and diminished when 1-butanol was added (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, PLD also negatively regulated RD29A, because its transcript level closely matched that of P5CS1, whatever the treatment. Proline Biosynthesis Is Mediated by Calcium—Several reports provided evidence pointing to calcium as an important secondary messenger leading to proline accumulation (for review see Ref. 10Hare P.D. Cress W.A. Van Staden J. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 413-434Google Scholar). We tested here the effect of verapamil, a phenylalkylamine-type calcium channel inhibitor that predominantly blocks L-type calcium channels (31White P.J. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 713-716Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and EGTA, an impermeant calcium chelator, on proline accumulation upon osmotic stress. A strong inhibition of proline accumulation was observed upon treatment of seedlings with 1 mm verapamil in the presence of 200 mm NaCl and to a lesser extent in the presence of 400 mm mannitol (Fig. 4). In NaCl-treated plants, EGTA completely inhibited proline accumulation, whereas the proline level was only reduced by 50% after mannitol treatment. These results show that calcium is a key component for the biosynthesis of proline in plants after a NaCl treatment and to a lesser extent after a mannitol treatment. Primary Butanol Enhanced Proline Responsiveness of Seedlings to Low Hyperosmotic Stress—Because 1-butanol stimulated proline accumulation, we tested whether calcium was another factor involved in proline biosynthesis (20Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1067-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Calcium alone did not have any effect on proline level at 50 mm (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the addition of both CaCl2 50 mm with 1-butanol increased the proline content to 2.5 μmol·g–1 fresh weight, which corresponds to the levels observed in NaCl- or mannitol-stressed plants. Like CaCl2, 50 mm KCl alone did not have any impact on proline levels (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the application of both 10 mm KCl and 1-butanol increased proline levels 2-fold, as was observed with 1-butanol alone. Treatment of seedlings with both 50 mm KCl and 1-butanol caused the same induction of proline biosynthesis as did NaCl or mannitol treatments (2.5 μmol·g–1 fresh weight). These results indicate that the observed increase of proline level is probably due to an osmotic effect and that calcium alone is not a limiting factor for the induction of proline synthesis upon the inhibition of PLD by 1-butanol. 50 mm CaCl2 or KCl did not have any measurable effect on P5CS level (Fig. 5B). However, the addition of 1-butanol together with CaCl2 dramatically increased the P5CS level, this effect being specific and dependent on the dose of calcium, because the application of KCl, even at 50 mm, with 1-butanol did not have any effect on P5CS. However, this increase of P5CS was not correlated with the corresponding accumulation of proline. Interestingly, the ProDH levels decreased when concentrations of CaCl2 or KCl were raised to 50 mm, even with butanol-1. The application of calcium stimulated the increase of AtP5CS1 transcript levels (Fig. 5C) as was already shown in Ref. 20Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1067-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar. AtP5CS1 and ProDH accumulation is correlated with their corresponding protein levels in plants treated with both 1-butanol and calcium. When seedlings were treated with both 1-butanol and 50 mm CaCl2, a strong increase of OAT and RD29A transcript levels were detected at 24 h (Fig. 5C), whereas these treatments did not have any effect on RAB18 transcript levels. However, OAT levels were not affected by any treatment with butanol isomers (data not shown). Taken together, these data illustrate fine regulation of proline metabolism by independent negative and positive regulators involving calcium and PLD. Recently, several reports suggested the implication of phospholipids in the mediation of plant responses to environmental stresses, especially drought and salinity. Several PLD genes have been isolated from various plant species, and their molecular characterization has shown their role in early signaling events. In this paper, we have established that PLDs during osmotic stress play a role as negative regulators of proline biosynthesis in A. thaliana. To our knowledge, this is the first case of the implication of PLDs as negative regulators of gene expression in plants. In response to hyperosmotic stress triggered by NaCl, mannitol, or sucrose, an increase of PA level and its conversion to diacylglycerol pyrophosphate has been reported in plants (29Munnik T.

PLC generates diacylglycerol and indirectly PA because of diacylglycerol kinase activity. However, a recent work demonstrated that PA mainly derives from AtPLDδ activity during dehydration because AtPLDδ antisense transgenic plants are affected in this PA accumulation in response to water stress (30Katagiri T. Takahashi S. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2001; 26: 595-605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLDα was also shown to play a crucial role in regulating transpiration water loss. Arabidopsis depleted in PLDα are impaired in stomatal closure and show reduced response to ABA (32Sang Y. Zheng S. Li W. Huang B. Wang X.

https://openalex.org/W2024579029,"Cyclooxygenase (COX)-generated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) plays critical roles in colorectal carcinogenesis. Recently, we have shown that PGE2 and transforming growth factor-α synergistically induces the expression of amphiregulin (AR) in colon cancer cells (Shao, J., Evers, B. M., and Sheng, H. (2003) Cancer Res. 63, 5218-5223). In this study, we demonstrated synergistic actions of PGE2 and the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling system in AR expression and in tumorigenic potential of colon cancer cells. Activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway induced AR transcription in colon cancer LS-174 cells that was enhanced by PGE2 in a synergistic fashion. The cAMP-responsive element within the AR promoter was required for the synergistic activation of AR transcription. An Sp1 element was responsible for the basal transcription of AR and significantly enhanced the synergy between PGE2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling system. Furthermore, activation of both PGE2 and EGFR signaling pathways synergistically promoted the growth and migration of colon cancer cells. Our results suggest that COX-2/PGE2 may exert pro-oncogenic effects through synergistic induction of receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathway, thus, provide a novel mechanism for the combinatorial treatment of colonic neoplasms targeting both COX-2/PGE2 and the EGFR system that has demonstrated remarkable advantages.

Dubois R.N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 11-21Google Scholar). Disruption of key steps of the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs) results in tumor reduction in ApcΔ716 mice. For examples, genetic deletion of cytosolic phospholipase A2, which releases arachidonic acid from cell membrane, or knock-out of COX-2 gene, which encodes the key enzyme for conversion of arachidonic acid to PGs, results in an ∼60% reduction of Apc mutation-induced intestinal adenomas in mice (2Oshima M.

In addition, disruption of E-type prostaglandin receptor, EP2, which mediates PGE2 signaling, reduces the number of adenomas by ∼60% in ApcΔ716 mice as well (4Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1048-1051Google Scholar), suggesting the critical role of the PGE2 signaling pathway in intestinal neoplasia.

PGE2 acts via four PGE receptor (EP) subtypes, which are designated as EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 (12Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 23-29Google Scholar). EP2 and EP4 receptors signal through increased cAMP and are thought to mediate PGE2 pro-oncogenic actions (4Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1048-1051Google Scholar, 7Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Google Scholar, 8Shao J. Lee S.B. Guo H. Evers B.M. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5218-5223Google Scholar). Thus far, the molecular mechanisms that mediate tumor-promoting effects of the PGE2 signaling system have not been extensively investigated. The epidermal growth factor family and their cognate receptors (EGFR), referred to as the ErbB family, play critical roles in colorectal carcinogenesis (13Karnes Jr., W.E. Weller S.G. Adjei P.N.

Binding of the ligand to the EGFR leads to activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that phosphorylate tyrosine residues of cellular signaling proteins and activate signaling pathways that are essential for intestinal epithelial proliferation and transformation (17Podolsky D.K.

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway transmits signals from tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors and plays critical roles in mitogenic signaling (21Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity that is critical for the proliferation and transformation of intestinal epithelial cells (16Sheng H. Shao H. DuBois R.N. J. Biol.

Gut. 2003; 52: 1472-1478Google Scholar) is required for the growth stimulation of PGE2 in human colon cancer cells (7Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Google Scholar). PGE2-induced DNA synthesis can be blocked by specific EGFR antagonists or antibodies to transforming growth factor α (TGF-α) and amphiregulin (5Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Google Scholar, 8Shao J. Lee S.B. Guo H. Evers B.M. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5218-5223Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that PGE2 induces the expression of amphiregulin (AR), a member of the epidermal growth factor family, which exerts mitogenic effect to colon cancer cells through an autocrine mechanism (8Shao J. Lee S.B. Guo H. Evers B.M. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5218-5223Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that PGE2 and TGF-α induced the expression of AR mRNA in a synergistic manner. These studies indicate the complexity of interaction between PGE2 and the EGFR signaling system and suggest that PGE2 may activate RTK-dependent signaling pathways through a variety of mechanisms. COX inhibitors are being developed as agents for the intervention of colorectal cancers (1Gupta R.A. Dubois R.N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 11-21Google Scholar). Elucidating the interaction between the PGE2 signaling pathway and other oncogenic signaling systems further will help to design novel strategies for prevention and treatment of colon cancers. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism by which PGE2 and the EGFR/Ras/MAPK system synergistically induced the expression of pro-oncogenic gene, AR. The functional synergy of PGE2 and the EGFR was elucidated. PGE2 and TGF-α stimulated the growth and migration of colon cancer cells in a synergistic manner. Thus, our results provide a novel mechanism for combined treatment of colorectal neoplasia by targeting both the COX-2/PGE2 pathway and the RTK signaling system. Cell Culture and Chemicals—LS-174 and T-84 human colon cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). LS-174 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. T-84 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Growth of cells in Matrigel® (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA) was carried out as described previously (7Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Google Scholar). PGE2 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). TGF-α was purchased from R&D system (Minneapolis, MN). H-89 and PD-153035 were purchased from Calbiochem. Dibutyryl cAMP was purchased from Sigma. Cell Migration Assays—Cell migration assay was carried out using Transwell chambers (8 μm, Corning Costar Co. Cambridge, MA). 5 × 104 cells suspended in 400 μl of serum-free McCoy's 5A medium were placed in the upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with 1 ml of McCoy's 5A medium containing vehicle or indicated treatment. After an incubation period of 24 h at 37 °C, the cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed with a cotton swab. The filters were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution. Cells adhering to the undersurface of the filter were counted. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—The assays to determine the activity of the AR promoter were described previously (8Shao J. Lee S.B. Guo H. Evers B.M. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5218-5223Google Scholar). Reporter constructs pGL2-A, pGL2-B, pGL2-BΔCRE, pGL2-C, and pGL2-CΔCRE containing the 5′-flanking region of the human AR gene were described previously (8Shao J. Lee S.B. Guo H. Evers B.M. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5218-5223Google Scholar, 24Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B. Herzlinger D. Kolquist K.A. Wong J. Paulding C. Yoon S.K. Gerald W. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 663-673Google Scholar). pGL2-A1 (-417 to -192) and pGL2-A2 (-372 to -192) were constructed using PCR. pGL2-A2ΔCRE was generated by digestion of pGL2-A2 with AatII and treatment with T4 DNA polymerase. For transient transfections, cells were co-transfected with indicated plasmids including 3 ng of the pRL-SV40 plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase gene (Promega, Madison WI) using the FuGENE 6 procedure (Roche Applied Science). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a luminometer. Firefly luciferase values were standardized to Renilla values and expressed as relative light units. The mammalian expression vector pSRα/Raf BXB contains the BXB mutant of c-Raf-1 kinase lacking amino acids 26-203 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael White). The active MEK1 expression vector, pMEK1(S218D/S222D), and wild type MEK1 expression vector, pMEK1, were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The active CREB expression vector, pCMV-CREB, and the dominant negative CREB, pCMV-KCREB, were purchased form BD Biosciences. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (23Shao J. Sheng H. Inoue H. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33951-33956Google Scholar). Cells were lysed for 30 min in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and then clarified cell lysates were denatured and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then the filters were incubated with the antibodies indicated and developed by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-pCREB, anti-pERK, and anti-pRSK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Data Analysis—All of the statistical analyses were performed on a personal computer with the StatView, version 5.0.1 software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC). Analyses among multiple groups were determined by ANOVA. Analyses between two groups were determined using the unpaired Student's t test. Differences with a p value of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Synergy between PGE2 and the Ras/Raf/MAPK Pathway—Cell growth and transformation require the expression of a subset of pro-oncogenic genes. Amphiregulin plays critical roles in colon cancer cell proliferation and transformation (25De Luca A. Arra C. D'Antonio A. Casamassimi A. Losito S. Ferraro P. Ciardiello F. Salomon D.S. Normanno N. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5863-5871Google Scholar, 26Damstrup L. Kuwada S.K. Dempsey P.J. Brown C.L. Hawkey C.J. Poulsen H.S. Wiley H.S. Coffey Jr., R.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1012-1019Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that PGE2 and TGF-α increase the expression of AR mRNA through synergistic induction of AR transcription (8Shao J. Lee S.B. Guo H. Evers B.M. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5218-5223Google Scholar). The Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway plays a central role in transduction of signals from EGFR. PGE2 and oncogenic K-Ras induces AR transcription in a synergistic manner (8Shao J. Lee S.B. Guo H. Evers B.M. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5218-5223Google Scholar). To completely assess the interaction between PGE2 and the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway, we ectopically introduced mutated Raf and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) into LS-174 cells. Transfection with an active Raf expression vector, Raf-BXB (16Sheng H. Shao H. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14498-14504Google Scholar), increased AR transcription ∼2.5-fold. The addition of PGE2 resulted in a 19-fold increase in the activity of AR promoter when compared with the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1A). In contrast, expression of a kinase-dead Raf construct did not change AR transcription. Moreover, expression of an active form of MEK1 increased AR promoter activity ∼13-fold. Again, a synergistic induction was observed between PGE2 and MEK1 activity (Fig. 1B). These results suggest a synergy between PGE2 signaling and the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway in context of AR transcription. TGF-α signals through the EGFR and RTK-dependent signaling pathways. PGE2 acts through induction of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Inhibition of either EGFR tyrosine kinases or the cAMP/PKA pathway attenuated the synergy of TGF-α and PGE2. Either a selective PKA inhibitor, H-89, or a specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PD-153035, partially attenuated the synergistic action of PGE2 and TGF-α. Combined treatment with H-89 and PD-153035 completely blocked the induction of AR transcription by PGE2 and TGF-α (Fig. 1C). Roles of the Sp1 in AR Transcription—Human AR promoter contains a number of functional domains, as schematically demonstrated in Fig. 2A (lower panel). To determine the relative contribution of each transcriptional element in AR transcription, progressive deletion constructs were generated. The luciferase activity observed with reporter vectors pGL2-A, pGL2-A1, and pGL2-A2 was approximately 20 times higher than that with pGL2 vector (Fig. 2A, upper panel). The major promoter activity was mapped to 44 nucleotides between -372 and -328 where an Sp1 consensus sequence (-353 to -348) was identified. Removal of the Sp1 site dramatically reduced AR promoter activity. Luciferase activity was decreased by ∼92% in pGL2-B-transfected cells. The reporter vector pGL2-A2, which contains the AR promoter sequence from -372 to -192 including the Sp1, a Wilms' tumor suppressor WT1-responsive element consensus, a CRE, and a TATA box, was constructed. PGE2 and TGF-α synergistically induced the luciferase activity in pGL2-A2-transfected LS-174 cells, suggesting these cis-elements are sufficient for the PGE2 and TGF-α synergy on AR transcription (Fig. 2B). Critical Roles of CRE in the PGE2 and TGF-α Synergy—The CRE element within AR promoter is critical for PGE2 induction of AR transcription (8Shao J. Lee S.B. Guo H. Evers B.M. Sheng H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5218-5223Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the Sp1 and the CRE in PGE2/TGF-α synergistic induction of AR transcription, the CRE element was mutated in pGL2-A2 construct and referred to as pGL2-A2ΔCRE. Although the basal activity of pGL2-A2 and pGL2-A2ΔCRE was similar, PGE2 did not increase the luciferase activity in pGL2-A2ΔCRE-transfected LS-174 cells. The synergistic effect of PGE2 and TGF-α was also attenuated by disruption of the CRE (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, induction of AR transcription by oncogenic K-Ras required the CRE domain. The synergistic induction of AR transcription by oncogenic K-Ras and PGE2 was attenuated when LS-174 cells were transiently transfected with pGL2-A2ΔCRE reporter construct (Fig. 3B). To confirm the critical role of the CRE in AR transcription, we co-transfected LS-174 cells with a wild type CREB expression vector and pGL2-A reporter vector. Expression of wild type CREB increased the level of luciferase activity 9-fold (Fig. 3C). In contrast, expression of a dominant negative form of CREB reduced the basal AR transcription and significantly blocked PGE2 activation of the AR promoter as well. In agreement with these observations, the addition of cAMP significantly increased AR promoter activity. A synergistic induction of AR transcription was noted when LS-174 cells were treated with both cAMP and TGF-α (Fig. 3D). The MEK-induced AR transcription was synergistically enhanced by cAMP treatment as well. To further determine the critical role of the CRE in PGE2/TGF-α regulation of AR transcription, LS-174 cells were transfected with pGL2-B reporter vector, which contains a Wilms' tumor suppressor WT1-responsive element, the CRE, and a TATA box. Removal of the Sp1 element significantly reduced AR promoter activity. The basal activity of pGL2-B was only ∼10% of the activity of the pGL2-A2; however, the PGE2/TGF-α-mediated regulation of AR promoter activity was fully preserved in pGL2-B-transfected LS-174 cells (Fig. 4A). PGE2 induced pGL2-B activity 9-fold, and PGE2 and TGF-α synergistically increased pGL2-B activity 19-fold. Mutation of the CRE completely attenuated the activity of the AR promoter. Similar results were observed in LS-174 cells that were transfected with pGL2-C promoter construct, which contains only 83 nucleotides (-275 to -192) including the CRE and a TATA box (Fig. 4B). We have demonstrated that PGE2 treatment rapidly induces the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133. Several studies indicate that TGF-α may induce phosphorylation and activation of CREB through the ERK/p90rsk (Rsk) pathway (28De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12202-12207Google Scholar, 29Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Google Scholar). Western analysis revealed that TGF-α treatment increased levels of phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated Rsk, and phosphorylated CREB (Ser-133) in LS-174 cells (Fig. 4C). PGE2 and TGF-α Synergistically Stimulated Colon Cancer Cell Growth—Because the EGFR signaling system and the COX-2/PGE2 signaling system can synergistically induce pro-oncogenic gene expression, it was of interest to determine whether these two signaling systems collaboratively enhance tumorigenic potential. We first elucidated the growth regulatory effects of PGE2 and TGF-α in colon cancer cells. LS-174 cells are able to form “tumor-like” aggregates when they are cultured in Matrigel (7Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Google Scholar). The colonies consisted of several layers of cells and a mucin-filled center. Morphologically, colonies formed by LS-174 cells in Matrigel were highly similar to LS-174 xenografts in athymic nude mice (Fig. 5A). The addition of TGF-α or PGE2 increased the size of colonies. In combination, TGF-α and PGE2 synergistically exerted growth-stimulatory effects on LS-174 cells (Fig. 5B). Colon cancer T-84 cells, which have been reported to react to PGE2 treatment (30Yu Y. Chadee K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3746-3752Google Scholar), formed similar three-dimensional structures in Matrigel. The synergistic stimulation of TGF-α and PGE2 on cell growth was observed in T-84 cells as well (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that TGF-α and PGE2 may stimulate the growth of colon tumors in a synergistic manner. PGE2 and TGF-α Synergistically Stimulated Colon Cancer Cell Migration—Several studies have demonstrated that PGE2 promotes migration and invasion of colon cancer cells (7Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Google Scholar, 10Buchanan F.G. Wang D. Bargiacchi F. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35451-35457Google Scholar, 11Pai R. Nakamura T. Moon W.S. Tarnawski A.S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1640-1647Google Scholar). On the other hand, TGF-α-activated EGFR signaling is critical for colon cancer cell migration (31Wilson A.J. Gibson P.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 187-196Google Scholar). To elucidate the collaborative regulation of cell migration by PGE2 and TGF-α, LS-174 cells were subjected to the Modified Boyden chamber assay (Transwell). Vehicle-treated LS-174 cells formed non-invasive clumps on the membrane after a 24-h incubation, so that most micropores were not covered by cells. LS-174 cells strongly spread when both PGE2 and TGF-α were present in the bottom chamber (data not shown). As a result, PGE2 and TGF-α synergistically stimulated LS-174 cell migration (Fig. 6A) and increased the number of cells that penetrated the membrane ∼15-fold (Fig. 6B). Similar results were reproduced in colon cancer T-84 cells (Fig. 6C). Colorectal cancers typically develop over decades and require a number of genetic changes for completion (32Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies demonstrate a 40-50% reduction in the relative risk of colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer-associated mortality in individuals taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on a regular basis (33Thun M.J.

Genetic disruption of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway results in a ∼ 60% tumor reduction in ApcΔ716 mice (2Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M.

These observations indicate the critical role of COX-2/PGE2 in colon cancer development and also raised an important question. What is the molecular mechanism that mediates the chronic pro-oncogenic action of the COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway in colorectal neoplasia? Recent studies have demonstrated that PGE2 induces rapid phosphorylation and transactivation of the EGFR through Src-mediated signaling (5Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Google Scholar, 10Buchanan F.G. Wang D. Bargiacchi F. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35451-35457Google Scholar, 11Pai R. Nakamura T. Moon W.S. Tarnawski A.S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1640-1647Google Scholar). Transactivation of the EGFR is particularly critical for PGE2-induced growth and invasion of colon cancer cells. Colorectal neoplasms are frequently associated with alterations of the EGFR signaling system. Epidermal growth factor receptors including their non-ligand-binding co-receptor, ErbB-2, are often up-regulated in colorectal neoplasms (36Shirai H. Ueno E. Osaki M. Tatebe S. Ito H. Kaibara N. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 2889-2894Google Scholar, 37Ozgul C. Karaoz E. Erdogan D. Dursun A. Acta Physiol. Hung. 1997; 85: 121-128Google Scholar). Overexpression of EGFR ligands including TGF-α, amphiregulin, and cripto in colonic tumors is well documented (25De Luca A. Arra C. D'Antonio A. Casamassimi A. Losito S. Ferraro P. Ciardiello F. Salomon D.S. Normanno N. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5863-5871Google Scholar, 36Shirai H. Ueno E. Osaki M. Tatebe S. Ito H. Kaibara N. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 2889-2894Google Scholar, 38Normanno N.

Transactivation of the EGFR by COX-generated PGE2 may further increase the activity of the EGFR and, therefore, enhance the oncogenicity of the EGFR signaling system. However, additional mechanisms appear to be necessary for the understanding of the key roles of COX-2/PGE2 in colorectal neoplasia that have been observed in epidemiological studies and in animal experiments as well (2Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Google Scholar, 4Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S.

Med. 1995; 333: 609-614Google Scholar). Our results show that the COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway and the RTK-dependent signaling system promoted the growth and migration of colon cancer cells in a synergistic fashion. These two signaling systems synergistically induced the expression of AR, providing the evidence that COX-2/PGE2 may collaboratively enhance the expression of pro-oncogenic genes, which are regulated by growth factors and oncogenes and which are critical for neoplastic transformation of intestinal epithelium. Thus far, COX-2/PGE2 itself is not considered as an oncogenic signaling pathway; however, our results suggest that COX-2/PGE2 may dramatically increase the activity of major oncogenic signaling systems and exert pro-oncogenic actions to colonic neoplasms. Cumulative evidence suggests that COX-2 is a target gene of oncogenic Ras (39Subbaramaiah K. Telang N. Ramonetti J.T. Araki R. DeVito B. Weksler B.B. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4424-4429Google Scholar, 40Sheng H. Williams C.S. Shao J. Liang P. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22120-22127Google Scholar, 41Sheng H. Shao J. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2670-2675Google Scholar). Inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity suppresses the growth of xenografts of Ras-transformed rat intestinal epithelial cells in nude mice, suggesting the involvement of COX-2 in Ras-mediated transformation (42Sheng G.G. Shao J. Sheng H. Hooton E.B. Isakson P.C. Morrow J.D. Coffey R.J. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1883-1891Google Scholar). We have reported that COX-2-generated prostacyclin enhances Ras-mediated activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (43Shao J. Sheng H. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3282-3288Google Scholar), which has been shown to protect colon cancer cells from apoptosis (44He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Google Scholar). In this study, we found that PGE2 synergistically enhanced Ras-induced transcription of a pro-oncogenic gene, AR, of which overexpression and involvement in colorectal tumors are well investigated (25De Luca A. Arra C. D'Antonio A. Casamassimi A. Losito S. Ferraro P. Ciardiello F. Salomon D.S. Normanno N. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5863-5871Google Scholar, 38Normanno N. Selvam M.P. Bianco C. Damiano V. de Angelis E. Grassi M. Magliulo G. Tortora G. Salomon D.S. Ciardiello F. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 62: 762-766Google Scholar). These findings suggest that COX-2-generated PGs may contribute to Ras-mediated transformation of intestinal epithelial cells through different mechanisms. Given the critical role of K-ras oncogene in the adenoma to carcinoma sequence of events involved in the neoplastic transformation of colonic epithelial cells, our results add new insight to the pro-oncogenic roles of the COX-2/PGs signaling system in the genetic pathway of colorectal neoplasia. The serine/threonine kinase Raf is a downstream effector of Ras (45Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Google Scholar). Activation of Raf is necessary and sufficient for the activation of the MEK/ERK cascade. Activated ERK phosphorylates and activates the Elk-1 transcription factor, thereby stimulating the transcription of genes controlled by the serum response element (46Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Google Scholar). The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway plays an important role in the control of metabolic processes, cell cycle, cell migration, cell proliferation, and cell transformation (47Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Google Scholar) and can be activated by a large number of growth factors and hormones through Ras-dependent or Ras-independent mechanisms (48Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 53-62Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate a direct collaboration among PGE2, Raf and PGE2, and MEK1 in regulation of AR transcription, suggesting that PGE2 is able to modulate the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at different levels and thereby regulate a wide variety of cellular functions. The human AR promoter contains a number of functional domains (24Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B. Herzlinger D. Kolquist K.A. Wong J. Paulding C. Yoon S.K. Gerald W. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 663-673Google Scholar, 27Plowman G.D. Green J.M. McDonald V.L. Neubauer M.G. Disteche C.M. Todaro G.J. Shoyab M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1969-1981Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the activation of the AR promoter was controlled by a constitutive and a regulatory domain. The Sp1 element appeared to provide the constitutive activity of the AR promoter, whereas the CRE was responsible for the regulatory activation of the promoter. Deletion of the Sp1 sequence reduced AR promoter activity by 90% but preserved its reactivity to PGE2 and TGF-α stimulation. In contrast, disruption of the CRE domain maintained the basal activity of AR promoter but attenuated the PGE2/TGF-α-induced AR transcription. Our data suggest that the cAMP/PKA pathway clearly mediated PGE2 signaling and was required for PGE2 induction of AR transcription. On the other hand, the effect of TGF-α on AR transcription was modest. TGF-α treatment resulted in phosphorylation of ERK, Rsk, and CREB, suggesting that TGF-α may regulate AR transcription via CRE as well (28De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12202-12207Google Scholar, 29Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Google Scholar). Additional experiments are required to determine the precise mechanism by which PGE2 and TGF-α synergistically induce AR transcription. Combination of anti-cancer agents that target several genetic or biochemical alterations involved in neoplasms may result in better therapeutic response than single treatment. Torrance et al. (49Torrance C.J. Jackson P.E. Montgomery E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Wissner A. Nunes M. Frost P. Discafani C.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1024-1028Google Scholar) report that a combination of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, sulindac, and an EGFR kinase inhibitor, EKI-569, achieved remarkable protection from intestinal neoplasia in ApcMin/+ mice. Although untreated ApcMin/+ mice developed ∼20 polyps/mouse, EKI-569 alone reduced intestinal polyps by 50% and sulindac alone inhibited the number of polyps by 70%. Interestingly, nearly half of the mice treated with these two agents developed no polyps at all. In another study (50Mann M. Sheng H. Shao J. Williams C.S. Pisacane P.I. Sliwkowski M.X. DuBois R.N. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1713-1719Google Scholar), combined therapy with a selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, and an antibody to Her-2/neu, a member of the ErbB/Her family of growth factor receptors, results in almost complete inhibition of the growth of xenografted colon cancers. The mechanisms by which these combinatorial treatments produce remarkable results were not clear, and choosing these therapeutic targets was based on the importance of individual signaling pathways. Our studies suggest that COX-2/PGE2 and the EGFR signaling system synergistically induce the expression of critical genes for colonic neoplasms and, therefore, provide a potential mechanism for the combinatorial treatment of colonic neoplasia targeting both the COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway and the EGFR signaling system that has demonstrated significant advantages.

Lee (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health) for providing amphiregulin promoter constructs and Dr. Michael White (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) for providing Raf expression construct."
https://openalex.org/W2147379232,"Correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity that induces long-term potentiation is known to induce a persistent enhancement of the intrinsic excitability of the presynaptic neuron. Here we report that, associated with the induction of long-term depression in hippocampal cultures and in somatosensory cortical slices, there is also a persistent reduction in the excitability of the presynaptic neuron. This reduction requires postsynaptic Ca(2+) elevation and presynaptic PKA- and PKC-dependent modification of slow-inactivating K(+) channels. The bidirectional changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic efficacy exhibit identical requirements for the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic activation but reflect two distinct aspects of activity-induced modification of neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2036652610,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades are readily activated during the response of plants to avirulent pathogens or to pathogen-derived elicitors. Here we show that the tomato MAP kinase LeMPK3 is specifically induced at the mRNA level during elicitation of the hypersensitive response in resistant plants infected by avirulent strains of the phytopathogenic bacteria Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, as well as upon treatment with the fungal elicitor ethylene-inducing xylanase. LeMPK3 gene expression was also induced very rapidly by mechanical stress and wounding much earlier than upon pathogen infection, but not in response to the defense-related plant hormones ethylene and jasmonic acid. Moreover, in resistant tomato plants infected by X. campestris pv. vesicatoria, transcript accumulation was followed by an increase in LeMPK3 kinase activity. Biochemical characterization of a glutathione S-transferase-LeMPK3 fusion protein revealed that the LeMPK3 MAP kinase autophosphorylates in vitro mainly on tyrosine and less so on threonine and serine, whereas it phosphorylates myelin basic protein on serine and threonine. In vitro phosphorylation of a poly-(Glu-Tyr) copolymer by LeMPK3 demonstrated its capability to phosphorylate tyrosine residues on substrates as well. By mutagenesis and phosphoamino acid analysis, Tyr-201 in the kinase activation domain was identified as the main LeMPK3 autophosphorylation site and as critical for kinase activity. Finally, LeMPK3 autophosphorylation showed a preference for Mn2+ cations and proceeded via an intramolecular mechanism with an estimated Km value for ATP of 9.5 μm. These results define LeMPK3 as a MAP kinase with dual specificity and strongly suggest that it represents a convergence point for different signaling pathways inducing the activation of defense responses in tomato.

Plants resist pathogen challenge both with preformed defenses, such as physical barriers or antimicrobial secondary metabolites, and by inducing efficient defense responses. Typical defense responses observed in resistant plants include the elicitation of a rapid and localized cell death, known as hypersensitive response (HR), 1The abbreviations used are: HR, hypersensitive response; R, resistance gene; avr, avirulence gene; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose binding protein; EIX, ethylene-inducing xylanase; Xcv, X. campestris pv. vesicatoria; RG-PtoR, Rio Grande carrying the Pto gene; RG-PtoS, Rio Grande without the Pto gene; Pst, P. syringae pv. tomato.

The activation of defense responses is mediated by the specific recognition of the invading pathogen either by the binding of a non race-specific elicitor to its receptor or by a gene-for-gene interaction between a plant resistance gene (R) and a pathogen avirulence gene (avr) (3Heath M.C.

Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 23-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Successful pathogen recognition triggers the activation of various signaling pathways that lead to cellular responses (4Martin G.B. Bogdanove A.J. Sessa G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 23-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). In recent years the study of defense signaling events activated by general elicitors and Avr proteins revealed that MAP kinase modules are involved in the induction of defense responses (5Nurnberger T. Scheel D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 372-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 6Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). In plants, as in yeast and mammals, MAP kinase signaling cascades enable the cell to transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses. In a typical three-tiered MAP kinase cascade, a MAP kinase is activated by a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) through dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues of a TXY motif located between subdomains VII and VIII of the kinase catalytic domain. In turn, MAPKK are activated by phosphorylation of an upstream MAP kinase kinase kinase. Such three-kinase modules function as molecular switches that turn on expression of specific sets of genes, resulting in the activation of cellular responses. A comprehensive analysis of the Arabidopsis genome sequence identified a group of at least 20 genes encoding putative MAP kinases that were further classified into four distinct major homology groups (7Jonak C. Okresz L. Bogre L. Hirt H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 8Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Tena G. Sheen J. Henry Y. Champion A. Kreis M. Zhang S.Q.

Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis MAP kinases of group A and their homologs from different plant species have been implicated in the plant response to non-race-specific elicitors. Two members of this group, AtMPK3 and AtMPK6, are part of a recently dissected signaling cascade, which is activated by the bacterial-derived flagellin elicitor and induces general defense responses but not the hypersensitive response (9Asai T.

Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 251-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In this pathway, binding of flagellin to the leucine-richrepeat receptor kinase FLS2 induces MAP kinase cascades, which activate AtMPK3 and AtMPK6, and leads to the activation of transcription factors of the WRKY family (9Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). Similarly, in parsley cell cultures PcMPK3 and PcMPK6, homologs of AtMPK3 and AtMPK6, respectively, are activated by a Phytophtora sojae-derived oligopeptide elicitor, which binds to a plasma membrane receptor and induces a broad array of defense responses (11Kroj T.

Activation of four different MAP kinases of group A has also been observed in alfalfa cell cultures in response to distinct pathogen-derived elicitors (13Cardinale F. Jonak C. Ligterink W. Niehaus K.

The tobacco SIPK and WIPK, which are homologs of Arabidopsis AtMPK6 and AtMPK3, respectively, are the only MAP kinases to date that have been shown to be activated both by general elicitors and by the interaction of race-specific avirulence proteins and their cognate resistance proteins (6Zhang S.

In tobacco plants activation of SIPK and WIPK was found to occur in an N-gene-dependent manner after tobacco mosaic virus inoculation and in a Cf9-dependent manner after inoculation with the fungal avirulence protein Avr9 (16Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clear evidence for the central importance of MAP kinase cascades in R-gene-mediated plant disease resistance has been recently attained in gain-of-function and silencing experiments. Transient expression of constitutively active mutants of SIPK and its upstream MAPKK NtMEK2 resulted in elicitation of the hypersensitive response and of several associated defense-related responses, including induction of defense genes and ethylene biosynthesis (18Kim C.Y.

Conversely, simultaneous reduction in the expression of NtMEK2, SIPK and WIPK, or of SIPK and WIPK only by virus-induced gene silencing resulted in attenuation of resistance to tobacco mosaic virus and to Pseudomonas cichorii, respectively (21Jin H. Liu Y. Yang K.Y. Kim C.Y. Baker B. Zhang S. Plant J. 2003; 33: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Sharma P.C. Ito A. Shimizu T. Terauchi R. Kamoun S. Saitoh H. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, tomato resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato was compromised by virus-induced gene silencing of genes homologous to the MEK1 and MEK2 MAPKKs and to the NTF6 and WIPK MAP kinases (23Ekengren S.K. Liu Y. Schiff M. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Martin G.B. Plant J. 2003; 36: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Finally, virus-induced gene silencing of the MAPKK kinase NPK1 in Nicotiana benthamiana plants interfered with the function of several disease resistance genes (24Jin H. Axtell M.J. Dahlbeck D. Ekwenna O. Zhang S. Staskawicz B. Baker B. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 291-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). MAP kinase homologs were recently isolated from tomato plants, and their inducibility by different elicitors and stress signals were analyzed (25Holley S.R. Yalamanchili R.D. Moura D.S. Ryan C.A. Stratmann J.W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1728-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). LeMPK1 and LeMPK2, which are highly homologous to the Arabidopsis AtMPK6 and tobacco SIPK, were activated by UV-B radiation as well as in response to systemin and to several oligosaccharide elicitors. An additional MAP kinase, LeMPK3, which shows high homology to the Arabidopsis AtMPK3 and tobacco WIPK, was activated only by UV-B. In this report we provide evidence that LeMPK3 may represent a convergence point of different signaling pathways that lead to elicitation of the hypersensitive response and which are mediated either by resistance proteins and their corresponding race-specific elicitors or by cultivar-specific receptors and their corresponding elicitors. Evidence suggesting the involvement of LeMPK3 in the tomato response to mechanical stress and wounding is also presented. Moreover, by a detailed in vitro characterization of the kinase activity of a glutathione S-transferase-LeMPK3 fusion protein, we provide important insights about LeMPK3 biochemical properties, which define it as a MAP kinase with dual specificity.

For pathogen treatments, 6-week-old plants were inoculated by vacuum infiltration for 1 min with bacterial cultures prepared as follows. Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria 110C strain T1 (Xcv T1) and 97–2 strain T3 (Xcv T3) were grown overnight at 28 °C in NYGB liquid medium (0.5% (w/v) Bacto Proteose Peptone, 0.3% (w/v) Yeast extract, and 4% (v/v) glycerol). Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with 10 mm MgCl2, and diluted to a concentration of 108 cfu/ml in 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.005% (v/v) Silwett-L77. Bacterial cultures of P. syringae pv. tomato (Pst) strain T1 expressing avrPto (T1A) were grown overnight at 28 °C in King's B liquid medium with the addition of 100 mg/liter rifampicin and 25 mg/l kanamycin and prepared for inoculation as described for Xcv strains. For treatment with the ethylene-inducing xylanase (EIX) elicitor from Trichoderma viride (29Dean J.F.D. Gamble H.R. Anderson J.D. Phytopathology. 1989; 79: 1071-1078Crossref Google Scholar), plants were vacuum-infiltrated with a solution containing 0.5 mg/l EIX (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.005% (v/v) Silwett-L77. For ethylene treatment, plants were placed in a plexiglass chamber where ethylene was injected to a final concentration of 20 ppm. For jasmonic acid treatment plants were sprayed with a solution containing 100 μm jasmonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1% (v/v) ethanol and 0.005% (v/v) Silwett-L77. Wounding treatment was carried out by gently rubbing the surface of leaves with wet Carborundum powder. Northern Blot Analysis—Tissues were harvested from treated plants at different time points as indicated in each experiment and used to extract RNA with the SV Total RNA Isolation kit (Promega). Total RNA (15 μg from each sample) was denatured at 60 °C, fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, and blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in 10× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) for 16 h. Blots were hybridized with probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) by using standard random priming methods. Hybridizations were performed at 60 °C for 16 h in a solution containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.75 m NaCl, 2% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 5 mm EDTA. After hybridization, blots were washed for 15 min in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 25 °C and twice for 15 min in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C and exposed to autoradiography for 48 h. The probes used were: LeMPK3, a gene-specific probe from position 872–1503 in the LeMPK3 nucleotide sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY261514); Lox2, a cDNA clone encoding lipoxygenase2 (GenBank™ accession number AW033547); GluB, a cDNA clone encoding a basic (1–3)-β-glucanase (a gift from Gregory Martin). Expression of Fusion Proteins in Escherichia coli—For expression in bacteria the LeMPK3 protein was fused in-frame to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) or to the C terminus of the maltose-binding protein (MBP). To develop the GST-LeMPK3 and MBP-LeMPK3 fusions, the LeMPK3-coding region (25Holley S.R. Yalamanchili R.D. Moura D.S. Ryan C.A. Stratmann J.W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1728-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using as a template the tomato EST cTOB17A11 (GenBank™ accession number AW624703; a gift from Gregory Martin) and the primers 5′-GGAATTCATGGTTGATGCTAATATGGGTG-3′ and 5′-GCTCGAGTTAAGCATATTCAGGATTCAACG-3′. The PCR product was digested by EcoRI and XhoI and inserted at the corresponding sites into the pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pMALc2X (New England BioLabs) vectors. For expression of the LeMPK3 mutant forms GST-LeMPK3(K70R) and GST-LeMPK3(T199A/Y201P), mutations were generated in the pGEX-4T1 plasmid containing the GST-LeMPK3 fusion using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The sequence of the oligonucleotides used is as follows: for GST-LeMPK3(K70R), 5′-GAGATGGTTGCAGTTCGAAAAATCGCCAATGC-3′ and 5′-GCATTGGCGATTTTTCGAACTGCAACCATC-3′; for GST-LeMPK3(T199A/Y201P), 5′-GAACGAGAATATGGCAGAATTCGTAGTAACCAGAT-3′ and 5′-ATCTGGTTACTACGAATTCTGCCATATTCTCGTTC-3′. The insertion in the gene of the desired mutation and the absence of undesired mutations were confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing using an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the construction of the GST-LeMPK2 fusion, the LeMPK2-coding region (25Holley S.R. Yalamanchili R.D. Moura D.S. Ryan C.A. Stratmann J.W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1728-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using as a template the tomato EST cLEF44J1 (GenBank™ accession number AW931285; a gift from Gregory Martin) and the primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGGATGGTTCAGCTCCGCAA-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGTCACATGTGCTGGTATTCGGGATT-3′. After digestion by BamHI and XhoI, the PCR product was inserted at the corresponding sites into the pGEX-4T1 vector. The resulting constructs were used to transform the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells. Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 28 °C. GST and MBP fusion proteins were affinity-purified by using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and amylose resin (New England Biolabs), respectively. Kinase Activity Assays—Autophosphorylation activity of fusion proteins was assayed at different protein concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 29 μm in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2, and 20 μm ATP) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. At this time phosphate incorporation was found to be linear for the highest amount of enzyme used in the reaction. Proteins were then fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the dried gel was analyzed by phosphorimaging (Fujifilm FLA-2000) or exposed to autoradiography. For the ATP dependence assay of autophosphorylation, GST-LeMPK3 (2 μg) was incubated with different concentrations of cold ATP ranging from 2 to 50 μm in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were performed as described above, and ATP incorporation was calculated based on the radioactivity counts and the concentration of cold ATP. Values for the Vmax and Km parameters were estimated according to the double-reciprocal plot and linear regression. For the divalent cation dependence assay, 2.5 μg of GST-LeMPK3 was incubated with different concentrations of MnCl2 or MgCl2, ranging from 0.1 to 20 mm, or with 10 mm CaCl2 in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. To test intermolecular autophosphorylation, MBP-LeMPK3 (1.5 μg) was incubated with the kinase-deficient fusion GST-LeMPK3(K70R) (1.5 μg) in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. For phosphorylation of substrates, the fusion proteins GST-LeMPK3, GST-LeMPK3(K70R), or GST-LeMPK3(T199A/Y201P) (1 and 2 μg for phosphorylation of myelin basic protein and of poly(Glu-Tyr), respectively) were mixed with 4 μg of myelin basic protein or with 8 μg of poly(Glu-Tyr) 4:1 copolymer (Sigma-Aldrich) in 20 μl kinase reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were performed and analyzed as described above. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Autophosphorylated GST-LeMPK3, GST-LeMPK3(T199A/Y201P) fusion proteins, or myelin basic protein phosphorylated by GST-LeMPK3 were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by India ink (1 μl/ml) staining, and the pertinent regions of the membrane were excised. Proteins were then hydrolyzed in 200 μlof6 m HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysates were dried in a Speedvac concentrator and resuspended in 20 μl of first dimension buffer (2.2% (v/v) formic acid and 7.8% (v/v) acetic acid, pH 1.9) containing 2 μg each phosphoamino acid standards (phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine; Sigma-Aldrich). Each sample was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis on thin layer chromatography (TLC) cellulose plates (pH 1.9, 1.5 kV for 30 min, and pH 3.5, 1.3 kV for 20 min) by using a HTLE7000 Hunter thin layer electrophoresis system (C.B.S. Scientific Co., Del Mar, CA), as described by van der Geer et al. (30van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 31-59Google Scholar). After spraying with 0.25% (w/v) ninhydrin in acetone to visualize the phosphoamino acid standards, the TLC plates were subjected to autoradiography for the detection of labeled phosphoamino acids. Antibody Production, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunocomplex Kinase Assay—The peptide MVDANMGAAQFPDFP, corresponding to the N terminus of the LeMPK3 protein, was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier. Polyclonal antiserum was obtained from rabbits immunized with 100 μg of the above-conjugated peptide for 4 times at 20-day intervals (Genemed Synthesis, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). For immunoprecipitation, leaf samples were homogenized in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1% Triton X-100), and total extracts (100 μg) were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of anti-LeMPK3 antiserum. Protein A immobilized on Sepharose 4 fast flow beads (25 μl packed volume; Amersham Biosciences) prewashed with extraction buffer was added to samples, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. The beads were precipitated by a brief centrifugation, washed at 4 °C 3 times with extraction buffer and 6 times with kinase reaction buffer (without ATP). Immunocomplexes were tested for kinase activity in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 4 μg of myelin basic protein. After 25 min reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. Proteins were then fractionated on a 15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, and the dried gels were exposed to autoradiography. LeMPK3 Is Induced at Multiple Levels during the Tomato Resistance Response to Xcv—For the identification of plant genes involved in tomato resistance to Xcv, we have used the suppression subtractive hybridization techniques (31Diatchenko L. Lukyanov S. Lau Y.F. Siebert P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 349-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) to construct a cDNA library enriched for Xcv-induced genes. Leaf material used for preparation of the library was derived from plants of the resistant tomato line Hawaii 7981, which develops a HR upon infection by Xcv T3 strains (26Scott J.W. Jones J.B. Somodi G.C. Stall R.E. Hortscience. 1995; 30: 579-581Crossref Google Scholar). In the cDNA library enriched for genes induced by Xcv T3 we identified the LeMPK3 gene, which was recently shown to be involved in the UV-B response of Lycopersicon peruvianum suspension cells (25Holley S.R. Yalamanchili R.D. Moura D.S. Ryan C.A. Stratmann J.W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1728-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). LeMPK3 encodes a MAP kinase highly homologous to MAP kinases from different plant species that have been implicated in the plant defense response (8Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Tena G. Sheen J. Henry Y. Champion A. Kreis M. Zhang S.Q. Hirt H. Wilson C. Heberle-Bors E. Ellis B.E. Morris P.C. Innes R.W. Ecker J.R. Scheel D. Klessig D.F. Machida Y. Mundy J. Ohashi Y. Walker J.C.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1728-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible involvement of LeMPK3 in tomato disease resistance to Xcv, we first analyzed its inducibility at the mRNA level during two different tomato-Xcv-incompatible interactions. The tomato lines used in these experiments are Hawaii 7981, which is resistant to Xcv T3 and susceptible to Xcv T1, and Hawaii 7998, which is susceptible to Xcv T3 and resistant to Xcv T1. Resistance of Hawaii 7981 to Xcv T3 is specified by a typical gene-for-gene interaction (26Scott J.W. Jones J.B. Somodi G.C. Stall R.E. Hortscience. 1995; 30: 579-581Crossref Google Scholar, 32Astua-Monge G. Minsavage G.V. Stall R.E. Davis M.J. Bonas U. Jones J.B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas resistance of Hawaii 7998 to Xcv T1 is mediated in a quantitative fashion by three genes in the plant and by a single gene in the bacterium (33Yu Z.H. Wang J.F. Stall R.E. Vallejos C.E. Genetics. 1995; 141: 675-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Whalen M.C. Wang J.F. Carland F.M. Heiskell M.E. Dahlbeck D. Minsavage G.V. Jones J.B. Scott J.W. Stall R.E. Staskawicz B.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Leaves of these two lines were infiltrated by vacuum with a suspension of either Xcv T3 or Xcv T1 bacteria at a titer of 108 cfu/ml. A mock-inoculation treatment was also included as a control for changes in gene expression resulting from vacuum infiltration. A typical hypersensitive response was observed only in the incompatible interactions of Hawaii 7981 and Hawaii 7998 with Xcv T3 and Xcv T1, respectively. Tissues were sampled at different time points after inoculation and used for total RNA extraction. A partial LeMPK3 cDNA clone, which represents a gene-specific probe, as established by Southern blot analysis (data not shown), was used for monitoring LeMPK3 expression levels in the treated plants. As shown in Fig. 1, LeMPK3 expression was significantly induced during the resistance response of the two tomato lines to Xcv as early as 8 h after inoculation. Accumulation of LeMPK3 transcripts was slightly faster during the incompatible interaction of Hawaii 7981 with Xcv T3 than in the interaction of Hawaii 7998 with Xcv T1. This correlated well with the earlier HR observed in Hawaii 7981 as compared with Hawaii 7998, taking place ∼18 and 24 h after inoculation, respectively. A very low increase in LeMPK3 mRNA levels was observed in the compatible interactions, and no effect of the mock-inoculation treatment was detected at the time points included in these experiments. To determine whether the accumulation of LeMPK3 mRNA correlated with higher protein and activity levels of the encoded MAP kinase, we first raised antibodies against a 15-amino acid peptide corresponding to the unique N terminus of LeMPK3. Comparison of the sequence of this peptide with proteins in the data base did not show any significant homology. To test the specificity of the antiserum, LeMPK3 and the closely related LeMPK2 MAP kinase were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins and affinity-purified (Fig. 2A, left panel). The anti-LeMPK3 antibodies specifically recognized the GST-LeMPK3 kinase and did not show any cross-reactivity with GST-LeMPK2 or GST alone (Fig. 2A, central panel). Moreover, the addition to the immuno-reaction of competitor peptide completely blocked binding of the anti-LeMPK3 antibodies to the GST-LeMPK3 protein (Fig. 2A, right panel).

https://openalex.org/W2040409641,"Abstract SOCS-3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) is an intracellular protein that is selectively and rapidly induced by appropriate agonists and that modulates responses of immune cells to cytokines by interfering with the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway. On the basis of the observations that interferon γ (IFNγ) up-regulates SOCS-3 gene and protein expression in primary mouse macrophages, J774 macrophage cell line and embryonal fibroblasts, we investigated which sequences of the 5′ SOCS-3 gene are responsive to IFNγ. By promoter deletion analysis we identified a functional IFNγ-responsive element, located at nucleotides -72/-64 upstream from the transcription initiation, whose presence and integrity is necessary to ensure responsiveness to IFNγ. This element contains a STAT consensus binding sequence (SOCS-3/STAT-binding element (SBE)) whose specific mutation totally abolished the responsiveness to IFNγ. In contrast, discrete deletion of other 5′ regions of the SOCS-3 promoter did not substantially modify the inducibility by IFNγ. Electromobility shift assay analyses revealed that IFNγ promotes specific DNA binding activities to an oligonucleotide probe containing the SOCS-3/SBE sequence. Even though IFNγ triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3 in macrophages and J774 cells, only STAT1 was appropriately activated and thus found to specifically bind to the SOCS-3/SBE oligonucleotide probe. Accordingly, IFNγ-induced SOCS-3 protein expression was not impaired in STAT3-deficient embryonal fibroblasts. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the induction of SOCS-3 by IFNγ depends upon the presence of a STAT-binding element in the SOCS-3 promoter that is specifically activated by STAT1."
https://openalex.org/W2111282444,"Synaptic activity causes reductions in cleft [Ca(2+)] that may impact subsequent synaptic efficacy. Using modified patch-clamp techniques to record from single neocortical nerve terminals, we report that physiologically relevant reductions of extracellular [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](o)) activate voltage-dependent outward currents. These outward currents are carried by a novel nonselective cation (NSC) channel that is indirectly inhibited by various extracellular agents (rank order potency, Gd(3+) > spermidine > Ca(2+) > Mg(2+), typical for [Ca(2+)](o) receptors). The identification of a Ca(2+) sensor-NSC channel pathway establishes the existence of a mechanism by which presynaptic terminals can detect and respond to reductions in cleft [Ca(2+)]. Activation of NSC channels by falls in [Ca(2+)](o) would be expected during periods of high activity in the neocortex and may modulate the excitability of the presynaptic terminal."

KSHV establishes latent infection in these tumors, invariably expressing high levels of the viral latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) protein. LANA is necessary and sufficient to maintain the KSHV episome. It also modulates viral and cellular transcription and has been implicated directly in oncogenesis because of its ability to bind to the p53 and pRb tumor suppressor proteins. Previously, we identified the LANA promoter (LANAp) and showed that it was positively regulated by LANA itself. Here, we present a detailed mutational analysis and define cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors for the core LANAp. We found that a downstream promoter element, TATA box, and GC box/Sp1 site at -29 are all individually required for activity. This architecture places LANAp into the small and unusual group of eukaryotic promoters that contain both the downstream promoter element and TATA element but lack a defined initiation site. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LANA regulates its own promoter via its C-terminal domain and does bind to a defined site within the core promoter.

Like other herpesviruses, KSHV can enter two different life cycles: lytic replication or latency. During lytic replication, all viral proteins are expressed and viral particles are released from the host cell, eventually resulting in the destruction of the host cell. During latent infection, only a few viral genes are expressed, and these are required for the establishment and maintenance of latency (13Zhong W. Wang H. Herndier B. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The LANA (open reading frame (ORF) 73, LNA) protein is the predominant target of anti-KSHV antibodies in infected individuals. Since KSHV does not encode an ORF with homology to either EBV EBNA-1 or EBNA-2, it has been surmised that KSHV LANA has subsumed the functions of the various EBNA proteins. Although LANA shows no homology at the sequence level, its phenotype and structural features are reminiscent of the EBV EBNA-1 protein, such as an extended central region of repeats. Like EBNA-1, LANA is localized to the nucleus and associated with chromatin. Two nuclear localization signals are located one each in the C-terminal region and N-terminal region (26Schwam D.R. Luciano R.L. Mahajan S.S. Wong L. Wilson A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8532-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27Piolot T. Tramier M. Coppey M. Nicolas J.C. Marechal V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3948-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The C terminus of LANA is required for dimerization (26Schwam D.R. Luciano R.L. Mahajan S.S. Wong L. Wilson A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8532-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and DNA binding. LANA specifically binds to two 17-bp motifs in the KSHV terminal repeats (TR). This interaction is necessary and sufficient for latent DNA replication (28Garber A.C. Hu J. Renne R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27401-27411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 29Garber A.C. Shu M.A. Hu J. Renne R. J.

Chromatin binding is mediated primarily by the N terminus of the protein and tethers the KSHV episome to cellular chromosomes, thereby ensuring proper segregation during host cell division (31Kedes D.H.

In addition to its role in viral episome maintenance, LANA modulates host cell behavior to create a suitable environment for latent KSHV persistence. LANA can cooperate with activated ras in fibroblast transformation assays (38Radkov S.A. Kellam P. Boshoff C. Nat.

We and others have identified a cluster of three latently expressed proteins (v-FLIP, v-cyclin, and LANA) and have shown that these proteins were expressed by differentially spliced, multicistronic mRNAs. The latent messages all were regulated by the same cis-regulatory region, which is called the LANA promoter (LANAp) (19Dittmer D. Lagunoff M. Renne R. Staskus K. Haase A. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8309-8315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Talbot S.J. Weiss R.A. Kellam P. Boshoff C. Virology. 1999; 257: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 46Sarid R. Wiezorek J.S. Moore P.S. Chang Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1438-1446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cis-minimal regulatory region of LANA is sufficient for the high level LANAp activity in cell lines of different origin: B cell-derived, endothelium-derived, and epithelium-derived. We and others previously identified DNA fragments upstream of the LANA ORF, which exhibited promoter activity in reporter-based assays (14Sarid R. Flore O. Bohenzky R.A. Chang Y. Moore P.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dittmer D. Lagunoff M. Renne R. Staskus K. Haase A. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8309-8315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Talbot S.J. Weiss R.A. Kellam P. Boshoff C. Virology. 1999; 257: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A summarizes the location of all LANA promoter mutants reported previously or generated for this study and summarizes their promoter activity in HEK293 cells. Similar results were observed in SLK (a KS-derived endothelial cell line) and B cell tumor lines (BJAB and BCBL-1). A set of mutants (pGL3-1 to pGL3-5) were constructed by Sarid et al. (14Sarid R. Flore O. Bohenzky R.A. Chang Y. Moore P.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and kindly provided to us by the authors. All constructs exhibited basal activity independently of the presence of other KSHV proteins. However, our studies also showed that LANAp was regulated positively by LANA and negatively by the p53 tumor suppressor protein (47Jeong J. Papin J. Dittmer D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, so far these two are the only known trans-acting factors that regulate LANAp. An analysis of the methylation status in the LANA promoter revealed the complete absence of methylation in LANAp in PEL and KS infection (48Chen J. Ueda K. Sakakibara S. Okuno T. Parravicini C. Corbellino M. Yamanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4119-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This phenotype is consistent with the constitutive transcriptional activity of LANAp and sets LANAp apart from other KSHV promoters that are rapidly methylated and silenced upon infection (48Chen J. Ueda K. Sakakibara S. Okuno T. Parravicini C. Corbellino M. Yamanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4119-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, LANAp was active in CD19+ B cells but not in CD3+ T cells, demonstrating that the cis-acting elements in LANAp are sufficient for appropriate lineage specificity (49Jeong J.H. Hines-Boykin R. Ash J.D. Dittmer D.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11024-11032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and that LANAp, in the absence of other viral genes, is sufficient to drive latent gene expression. Here, we present a detailed mutational analysis of LANAp to define cis-acting elements and trans-regulatory factors. We demonstrate that LANA promoter activity depends on a downstream promoter element (DPE) and TATA box as well as members of the Sp1/Krueppel family of transcription factors. LANAp is the first viral promoter that is a member of the class of eukaryotic promoters that contain both a DPE element and a TATA element but lack a defined initiation site. Plasmids—All nucleotide sequence positions are based on the BC-1 KSHV isolate as sequenced by Russo et al. (82Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14862-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Plasmids pDD41, pDD83, pDD104, pDD124, pDD125, pDD163, pDD274, and pDD267 were described previously (47Jeong J. Papin J. Dittmer D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 49Jeong J.H. Hines-Boykin R. Ash J.D. Dittmer D.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11024-11032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The plasmids pGL3-1 (pDD463), pGL3-2 (pDD464), pGL3-3 (pDD465), pGL3-4 (pDD466), and pGL3-5 (pDD467) were a gift from Yuan Chang (University of Pittsburg, OH) (14Sarid R. Flore O. Bohenzky R.A. Chang Y. Moore P.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These were originally PCR-amplified from the BC-1-derived KSHV isolate, whereas all other plasmids in this paper were cloned from a KS-derived KSHV λ-library (13Zhong W. Wang H. Herndier B. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6641-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). All plasmids were sequenced to confirm sequence and orientation and showed no deviation from the KSHV sequence deposited by Russo et al. (82Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14862-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). The 5′-UTR region up to the NcoI site (nucleotides 127,296 to 127,609) in pDD124, pDD125, and pDD168 was PCR-amplified from the BCBL-1 KSHV isolate. The NcoI/NheI fragment of pDD83 was modified to blunt ends using DNA polymerase I, large (Klenow) fragment (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). The blunted fragment was inserted into the SmaI site of pBlue-script II KS (+/-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to yield pDD750. The plasmids pDD751 and pDD753 were generated by inserting the SacI/KpnI fragment of pDD750 into the SacI/KpnI sites of pGL3 basic (Promega, Madison, WI) and inserting the XhoI/SacI fragment of pDD750 into the XhoI/SacI sites of pGL3 basic, respectively. Plasmids expressing LANA mutants, LANA1 ΔC50 (pDD770), LANA1 NLS ΔDED (pDD771), LANA1 NLS LZ-C (pDD772), and LANA1 Δ1002-1062 (pDD774) (courtesy of Joonho Choe, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Korea), were described previously (70Lim C. Sohn H. Lee D. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10320-10331Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 83Lim C. Lee D. Seo T. Choi C. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7397-7405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Plasmids with larger deletions of LANA, LANA-A (pDD720), LANA-AB (pDD721), LANA-BC (pDD722), and LANA-C (pDD7230) were as described by Garber et al. (29Garber A.C. Shu M.A. Hu J. Renne R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7882-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For the construction of the target plasmid for transposon mutagenesis, the NotI restriction site in pDD83 was destroyed by digestion with NotI, Klenow-mediated fill in and blunt religation. This yielded pDD365. pDD365 gives results identical to pDD83, confirming that removal of the NotI site and vector sequences distal to the LANAp insert had no effect on LANAp-dependent reporter gene transcription. Afterward, transposon mutagenesis was performed on pDD365 using the EZ::TN In-Frame Linker Insertion Kit (Epicenter Technologies). This method relies on the ability of a modified 1000-bp Tn5 transposon element-coupled to transposase to insert itself randomly into target DNA in vitro (81Goryshin I.Y. Miller J.A. Kil Y.V. Lanzov V.A. Reznikoff W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10716-10721Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 84Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Transposon events are identified by kanamycin resistance. DNAs from positive clones were subsequently digested with NotI to release the KanR marker and religated to regenerate a NotI site and a 57-bp insertion in the clone. 400 mutants were randomly selected for plasmid purification and analysis. Since the size of the LANAp fragment is 552 bp compared with ∼2500 bp (pGL3 basic vector minus origin and minus AmpR region), we expected one in five clones to contain an insertion in the LANAp region. Unfortunately, of 400 Tn5 mutants, we isolated only 12 mutants with an insertion in the 552-bp KSHV LANAp sequence. This is less than the expected ratio and suggests integration bias on the part of the Tn5 in vitro transposon reaction. Transposon insertions in plasmids pDD700-pDD711 were confirmed by sequencing. In order to screen the TN5 mutants, we eliminated a NotI site in the vector backbone, yielding pDD365. PstI linkers (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) were ligated into the SmaI and PvuII sites of pDD83 to yield pDD461 and pDD413, respectively. A map of all reporter constructs is shown in Fig. 1. For the PCR-directed site mutagenesis, pDD83 served as the wild-type template. Mutants containing two base pair substitutions in the putative transcription factor binding sites of LANAp were generated using the GeneTailor™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). The two base pair substitutions in pDD780, pDD782, pDD783, and pDD784 are shown in Fig. 2A and were confirmed by sequencing. To eliminate the possibility that inadvertent second-site mutations in the luciferase ORF might be responsible for the loss of luciferase activity, we recloned the LANAp region containing 2-bp substitutions that result in loss of function into pGL3 basic. The “recloned” plasmids showed similar promoter activity compared with the parent plasmids, demonstrating that loss of function was due to the internal mutation (data not shown). Tissue Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (0.05 μg/ml), and streptomycin (5 units/ml) (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. At day 1, cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/ml/well (6-well plate) to reach 50% confluence after 24 h. At day 2, 4000 ng of total DNA together with 1000 ng pDD173 (pCDNA3.1-hislacZ; Invitrogen) was suspended in 150 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (no serum, no antibiotics) and 7.5 μl of Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The transfection mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the total volume was adjusted to 1.5 ml with complete medium. Cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 0.5 ml of transfection mixture was added per triplicate well. Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2, and the medium was exchanged with complete medium. All transfections were repeated at least three times each in triplicate. Luciferase Activity—Firefly luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a Turner TD20/20 luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. β-Galactosidase activity was determined using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as described (47Jeong J. Papin J. Dittmer D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or the Galacto-Light Plus kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from BCBL-1 cells and diluted with dilution buffer at 1:1 ratio (12 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 5 μm ZnSO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 50% glycerol). Annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides (50 ng) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding reaction was performed at room temperature for 30 min in a mixture containing 2 μl of the diluted nuclear extract (∼10 μg), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2 μl of 1 m NaCl, 3 μl of 5× binding buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 20% glycerol), and 2 μl of labeled oligonucleotide. For the competition experiments, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were added in up to a 100-fold molar excess in the initial reaction mixture. For supershift analysis, after the incubation for 10 min at room temperature, 3 μl of a polyclonal rabbit antibody against LANA (a gift from Jae U. Jung, Harvard University) or a polyclonal goat anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the binding reaction mixture. DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis through 4.7% polyacrylamide gel at 200 V at 4 °C for 2 h. Western Blot Analysis—HEK293 cells were transfected with 10 μg of total DNA using 20 μl of Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per 10-cm dish. 48 h after the transfection, whole cell extracts were prepared in 300 μl of sample buffer (80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 10% sucrose, and 0.004% bromphenol blue) with boiling for 5 min. Lysates were electrophoretically separated on Bio-Rad 4-15% gradient-ready gels. Proteins were transferred to Hybond™-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 12 mm glycine, and 10% methanol), and the membranes were blocked with 5% milk overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (0.05% Tween 20) for 10 min each time. The membranes were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit antibody (1:5000 dilution) against LANA (a gift from Jae U. Jung) in Blotto HD (28 mm Tris-HCl, 22 mm Tris base, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2% SDS) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and then washed three times with Blotto HD (0.2% bovine serum albumin). The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in Blotto HD (0.2% bovine serum albumin) for 45 min and subsequently washed three times with Blotto HD. After final washing with phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, the blots were developed with the Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Sequences Downstream of the Transcription Start Site Contribute to Core Promoter Activity—The side-by-side comparison of the deletion clones from Sarid et al. (14Sarid R. Flore O. Bohenzky R.A. Chang Y. Moore P.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with those from Jeong et al. (47Jeong J. Papin J. Dittmer D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) allowed us to further define LANAp. Confirming previous observations, both sets of clones exhibited significant constitutive promoter activity as long as sequences up to -88 (127,968) were included. However, the deletion clones starting at +11 (127,869) showed a generally lower level of activity compared with the clones starting at +271 (127,609). Of the two deletion mutants that extended to -279 (128,159) and differed only by their proximal site at +271 (127,609) or +11 (127,869), the clone starting at +271 exhibited ≥10-fold promoter activity, whereas the clone starting at +11 exhibited only ≥3-fold promoter activity above vector control (Fig. 1A). A second difference between the +271 to -279 reporter construct (pDD83) and the +11 to -279 reporter construct (pGL3-3) was that in the latter the KSHV promoter region was cloned into the multiple cloning site of pGL3basic (Promega), whereas pDD83 starts at the luciferase start codon and replaces the 5′-UTR and translation-initiation sequence originally present in pGL3 basic with KSHV sequences (Fig. 1B). To investigate the influence of this difference, we cloned the region +271 to -279 into the multiple cloning sites of pGL3 basic as shown in Fig. 1B. This yielded pDD753 retained the 5′-UTR of pGL3basic and differed from pGL3-3 by 291 nucleotides downstream of LANA promoter start site. As shown in Fig. 1D, transfection assays in HEK293 cells with pDD465 (pGL3-3) and pDD753 showed significant differences in promoter activity, demonstrating that sequences between +11 and +271 contribute to LANAp activity. Similar results were obtained in the KS-derived SLK, the B cell-derived BJAB and the PEL-derived BCBL-1 cell lines (data not shown). Transposon-mediated Insertion Mutagenesis—To identify additional cis-acting elements in the LANAp region, we subjected our reporter plasmid pDD365 (+271 to -279) to in vitro transposon mutagenesis using the EZ::TN in-frame linker insertion kit (Epicenter Technologies). Fig. 1D shows the relative reporter activity of each insertion mutant in HEK293 cells. Mutants pDD700 (+270), pDD701 (+249), pDD702 (+245), pDD703 (+241), pDD704 (+241), pDD705 (+237), pDD707 (+200), pDD709 (+198), pDD710 (+179), and pDD711 (-44) show decreased promoter activities compared with the wild-type control, pDD83. In contrast, mutants pDD706 and pDD708 show promoter activities higher than the wild-type control, suggesting that the transposons did not disrupt an essential site. We also investigated whether any of these insertion mutants had lost the ability to be transactivated by LANA (data not shown). None of them did, suggesting that LANA's transactivation of LANAp uses other sites in the promoter. Based on our deletion analysis, we conclude that essential LANAp elements are located between +11 and +271 but not distal to -88 relative to th"
https://openalex.org/W2053958526,"Hypoxia plays a key role in the pathophysiology of many disease states, and expression of the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor α (RORα) gene increases under hypoxia. We investigated the mechanism for this transient hypoxia-induced increase in RORα expression. Reverse transcription-coupled PCR analysis revealed that the steady-state level of mRNA for the RORα4 isoform, but not the RORα1 isoform, increased in HepG2 cells after 3 h of hypoxia. Transient transfection studies showed that the hypoxia-induced increase in RORα4 mRNA occurs at the transcriptional level and is dependent on a hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) located downstream of the promoter. A dominant-negative mutant of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) abrogates the transcription activated by hypoxia as well as the transcription activated by exogenously expressed HIF-1α, demonstrating the direct involvement of HIF-1α in the transcriptional activation. However, HIF-1 alone was not sufficient to activate transcription in hypoxic conditions but, rather, required Sp1/Sp3, which binds to a cluster of GC-rich sequences adjacent to the HRE. Deletion of one or more of these GC boxes reduced or eliminated the HIF-1-dependent transcription. Together, these results suggest that the hypoxia-responsive region of the RORα4 promoter is composed of the HRE and GC-rich sequences and that the transcriptional activation under hypoxia is conferred through the cooperation of HIF-1 with Sp1/Sp3.

Members of the nuclear receptor superfamily play intrinsic roles in a variety of cellular processes, such as embryogenesis, cell differentiation, cell growth, and cell homeostasis (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

Nuclear receptors, as ligand-dependent transcription factors, activate or repress transcription by binding directly to target genes. They are divided into three groups on the basis of their DNA recognition elements. The first group includes the receptors for steroid hormones, including glucocorticoid and androgen, and recognizes an inverted repeat of an AGAACA half-site motif. The second group, which includes the receptors for nonsteroid hormones such as thyroid hormone, retinoids, and vitamin D, recognizes a direct repeat of an AGGTCA half-site motif. Most of the nuclear receptors so far identified belong to this group. In contrast to these two groups, the third group includes nuclear receptors that recognize and bind to the AGGTCA half-site motif as a monomer. Little is known about ligands for the members of this group.

Kurebayashi S. Ueda E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 205-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has been accumulating that RORα is involved in cell differentiation and proliferation. The homozygous mutant mouse staggerer (sg) was initially described as ataxic due to the presence of massive neurodegeneration in the cerebellum. The identification of the widely expressed RORα gene as the site of mutation in the sg mouse has led in recent years to great progress in understanding the molecular basis of its phenotype (4Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Korreblock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L. van Berkel V. Birren B.W. Kruglyak L. Lander E.S. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). RORα knock-out mice display the same cerebellar atrophic phenotype as the sg mouse (5Dussault I. Fawcett D. Matthyssen A. Bader J.A. Giquere V. Mech.

Detailed analyses of such RORα-deficient mice have revealed a number of additional phenotypes outside the nervous system. These include a greater susceptibility to atherosclerosis (7Mamontova A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and an increase in ischemia-induced angiogenesis (12Besnard S. Silverson J.-S. Duriez S. Bakouche J. Lemaigre-Dubreuli Y. Mariani J. Levy B.I. Tedgui A. Circulation Res. 2001; 89: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RORα has also been suggested to play a role in vascular function (13Faraci F.M. Circulation Res. 2002; 90: 749-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 14Besnard S. Bakouche J. Lemaigre-Dubreuil Y. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Henrion D. Circulation Res. 2002; 90: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It thus appears that RORα has direct links to a number of age-related pathologies of great medical interest. RORα is composed of four isoforms that share common DNA and ligand binding domains but differ in their N-terminal regions (15Giguere V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 16Carlberg C. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Staple J.K. DeLamarter J.F. Becker-Andre M. Mol.

Brain Res. 1996; 42: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). They are produced from a single gene by way of different promoters. It has been suggested that the N-terminal region of RORα affects the specificity of recognition by RORα-responsive elements (21Giguere V. McBroom L.D. Flock G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2517-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although RORα is expressed ubiquitously in vivo, each isoform shows a tissue-specific distribution (18Sashihara S. Felts P.A. Waxman S.G. Matsui T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Besnard S. Heymes C. Merval R. Rodriguez M. Galizzi J.-P. Boutin J.A. Mariani J.

Several tissues or cell types, including liver, brain, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, express mainly RORα1 and RORα4, whereas RORα2 and RORα3 are expressed abundantly in testis. These observations suggest that each RORα isoform plays a different role in a range of cellular processes. Although little is known about the regulation of RORα expression, it has recently been demonstrated that expression of RORα is transiently increased when ischemia is induced in the hindlimbs of mice (12Besnard S. Silverson J.-S. Duriez S. Bakouche J. Lemaigre-Dubreuli Y. Mariani J. Levy B.I. Tedgui A. Circulation Res. 2001; 89: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and in various cell types in response to oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) (20Chauvet C. Bois-Joyeux B. Danan J.-L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Fukuda R. Kelly B. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2330-2334PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia is an essential developmental and physiological stimulus that also plays a key role in the pathophysiology of cancer, heart attack, stroke, and other major causes of mortality (for review, see Ref. 23Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Cellular adaptation to hypoxia is associated with induction of a number of genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin, several glycolytic enzymes, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (23Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional induction of these genes is mediated in large part by HIF-1, which is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of HIF-1α and HIF1β (also known as ARNT) (24Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 25Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). HIF-1 binds directly to a hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) and activates the transcription of genes to adapt to oxygen deprivation. Although HIF-1β is constitutively expressed and is stable under normoxia, expression of the HIF-1α protein is regulated by the level of oxygen (26Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 27Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6519-6525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). During normoxia, HIF-1α protein undergoes rapid ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Upon hypoxia, the ubiquitination is blocked, which allows HIF-1α to dimerize with HIF-1β and to translocate it into the nucleus (29Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the mechanism by which the expression of RORα gene is regulated during hypoxia. The results show that the hypoxia-induced increase of RORα expression is specific for the RORα4 isoform and occurs at the transcriptional level. Promoter analysis revealed a novel structure for the hypoxia-responsive region, which consists of a putative HRE and a cluster of GC-rich sequences. The hypoxia-induced activation of the RORα4 promoter appears to be regulated through a functional interaction between HIF-1 and Sp1/Sp3. Cell Culture and Induction of Hypoxia—HeLa cells and HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Caco2 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and nonessential amino acids. For exposure to hypoxia, cells were cultured in a humidified 1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2 incubator for the indicated time. Alternatively, cells were cultured in medium containing 100 μm cobalt chloride (Co2+). Reverse Transcription-coupled PCR —Total RNA was prepared using the ISOGEN reagent (Wako, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed at 37 °C in a total volume of 20 μl containing 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 37.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml random primers (Takara Japan), 0.5 mm each dNTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Takara Japan), 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MBI Fermentas), and 1 μg of total RNA. After 60 min of incubation, an aliquot of the synthesized cDNA was directly amplified in a total volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm primers, 0.25 mm each dNTP, and 0.25 unit Taq polymerase (Takara Japan). The reaction contained three primers, Pα1 (RORα1-specific 5′ primer, 5′-AAACATGGAGTCAGCTCCGG-3′), Pα4 (RORα4-specific 5′ primer, 5′-TGTGATCGCAGCGATGAAAG-3′), and Pc (3′ primer common for RORα1 and RORα4, 5′-GGCGTACAAGCTGTCTCTCTG-3′). PCR conditions included 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, 24–33 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified DNAs were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. As a control, the same cDNAs were subjected to PCR (20 cycles) with β-actin primers (5′ primer, 5′-CCATGTACGTTGCTATCCAG-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-AATGCCAGGGTACATGGTGG-3′). The reverse transcription-coupled PCR experiment was repeated at least three times. Plasmid DNA—A mouse genomic library was screened using the 5′-end of the RORα4 cDNA as a probe. About 6 kilobases of the XhoI fragment containing the RORα4 promoter region was subcloned into the XhoI site of the pGVB2 luciferase vector (Nippon Gene, Japan), in which the HindIII site has been disrupted (pRORα4XXluc). 5′-Deletion mutants were constructed by exonuclease III/S1 nuclease digestion of pRORα4XXluc at the HindIII site followed by digestion with NheI. After ligation with an EcoRI linker (5′-CCGAATTCGG-3′), the larger DNA fragment was isolated and self-ligated. For construction of 3′ deletion mutants, pRORα4HXLuc was constructed by removing the HindIII-NheI fragment from pRORα4XXLuc, digestion by exonuclease III/S1 nuclease at the XhoI site, and ligation with the EcoRI linker. After digestion with SphI the larger DNA was isolated and subcloned into the SmaI (changed to an EcoRI site with the linker) and SphI sites of pGVB2. An internal deletion mutant was constructed by combination of the 5′ and 3′ deletion mutant. A HRE-mutated RORα4 reporter was constructed using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The primer used to introduce a mutation within the HRE was 5′-CGCGCCTGCCGGAGCACCGGTACAGCTTGAGGGG-3′. An expression vector for HIF-1α (pBoshHIF-1α) was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Fujii. An expression vector producing a dominant negative HIF-1α (amino acids 1–363, pHIF-1αDN) was constructed by partial digestion of pBoshHIF-1α with Age I. Transfection of Cells—Transfection was performed using the Effectene™ reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 24-well microplate at a density of 4–6 × 104/well 1 day before transfection. Fifty nanograms of reporter DNA, 50 ng of effector DNA, and 50 ng of pSGβGal were used for each well. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 200 ng with pUC19 DNA. After transfection for 12–16 h, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then grown for 24 h in fresh medium. All transfections were carried out in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. The relative luciferase activity was calculated by normalization to the β-galactosidase activity. Electromobility Gel Shift Assay (EMSA) and DNase I Footprinting Analysis—Nuclear extracts from normoxic or hypoxic cells were prepared as described previously (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). The nuclear proteins was incubated in a 10-μl reaction containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC). After 10 min on ice, 32P-labeled probe was added (10,000 cpm/reaction), and the reaction was further incubated on ice for 20 min. The DNA-protein complex was separated in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. For DNase I footprinting, the binding reaction was carried out in a total of 20 μl under the same conditions as EMSA. After binding for 20 min, CaCl2, MgCl2, and DNase I were added to final concentrations of 0.25 mm, 5 mm, and 100 ng/ml, respectively. Digestion was performed for 1 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of a final concentration of 10 mm EDTA. The DNA was then purified and analyzed using a 5% denaturing sequence gel. Oligonucleotides used in the binding experiments were as follows: HREα4, 5′-GCCGGAGCTCACGTACAGCTTGAG-3′; HREα4m, 5′-GCCGGAGCTCAAATACAGCTTGAG-3′; HREepo, 5′-CTAGCCCTACGTGCTGCCTCG-3′; GC-box, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′; GA-box, 5′-TCACTTGGGGGAGGATTGCAT-3′; GRE, 5′-AGTTATGGTTACAAACTGTTCTTAAAACA-3′. Induction of RORα4 Isoform Expression by Hypoxia—During hypoxia, HepG2 cells have been shown to express increased levels of RORα (20Chauvet C. Bois-Joyeux B. Danan J.-L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To confirm this in our hands, we first used reverse transcription-coupled PCR to analyze the effects of hypoxia on the steady-state levels of RORα1 and RORα4 mRNA in HepG2 cells. To avoid artifacts due to fluctuations in the PCR reactions, amplification of both transcripts was carried out in the same reaction using two 5′ primers specific for each isoform and a common 3′ primer. Each 5′ primer selectively amplified its target transcript (data not shown). The amount of RORα4 mRNA increased several-fold after the cells were exposed to hypoxia for 3 h, whereas that of RORα1 mRNA did not change (Fig. 1). In addition, the increased level of RORα4 mRNA decreased to the control level when the cells were reoxygenated (data not shown). Thus, hypoxia specifically increased expression of the RORα4 isoform in HepG2 cells. Transcriptional Regulation of the RORα4 Gene Promoter by Hypoxia—Because each RORα isoform differs from the other isoforms only in its N-terminal region, it is likely that the hypoxia-induced increase of RORα4 mRNA expression is regulated at the transcriptional level. To examine this, we analyzed the effect of hypoxia on RORα4 promoter activity in a transient transfection assay. We constructed a reporter DNA in which a fragment encompassing the region from -1015 to +408 of the mouse RORα4 promoter was linked upstream to the firefly luciferase gene. As shown in Fig. 1C, transcription of the RORα4 promoter increased severalfold upon exposure of the transfected HepG2 cells to hypoxia. A similar increase in the promoter activity was also observed when cells were grown in medium containing 100 μm CoCl2 (Co2+), which is known to mimic hypoxic conditions. Additionally, almost identical transcriptional responses to hypoxia were observed both in HeLa and Caco2 cells, each of which differently expresses RORα4 mRNA (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the hypoxia-induced increase of RORα4 expression occurred at the transcriptional level. Because the promoter activity of RORα4 was highest in Caco2 cells (data not shown), we used these cells for the following transfection experiments. To identify cis elements responsible for the hypoxia-induced activation of the RORα4 promoter, we constructed a series of mutant DNAs lacking the 5′-upstream or 3′-downstream region and analyzed their promoter activities under hypoxia (Fig. 2). Although deletion of the region upstream from -397 resulted in a decrease of the basal transcription to about 40% that of the control, any deletion of the 5′-flanking region did not affect the activation of transcription by hypoxia. Deletion of a region downstream from +273 also did not affect the hypoxia-induced activation of transcription, but further deletion to +241 resulted in a loss of responsiveness to hypoxia. An identical result was obtained in the presence of Co2+ (data not shown). Inspection of the nucleotide sequence from +240 to +273 revealed the existence of a 5′-CACGTAC-3′ sequence, which conforms well to the consensus HRE, 5′-(C/G/T)ACGT(G/C)C(G/T) (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the putative HRE found within the RORα4 promoter is indeed responsible for the transcriptional activation under hypoxia, a specific mutation was introduced within the sequence, and its effect on transcription was analyzed. Fig. 3B shows that the hypoxia-induced activation of transcription was markedly abrogated by the mutation within the HRE, indicating its direct involvement in the activation of the RORα4 promoter under hypoxia. Similar results were obtained in the presence of Co2+ (data not shown).Fig. 3Direct involvement of an HRE in the transcriptional activation of the RORα4 promoter. A, the nucleotide sequence around +260 is shown. A putative HRE is underlined and compared with that of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene. B, the wild type (wt) or HRE mutant (mt) RORα4 reporter was transfected along with pSVβgal into Caco2 cells. Eighteen hours after transfection the cells were cultured for 24 h under normoxia (open bar) or hypoxia (closed bar).

The means and S.D. based on 3–5 independent transfections are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Direct Involvement of HIF-1 in the Regulation of the RORα4 Promoter—Activation of hypoxia-inducible genes is mediated in large part by the binding of HIF-1 to the HRE. HIF-1α contains two transcriptional activation domains in its C-terminal half (31Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed a mutant form of HIF-1α lacking the C-terminal region from amino acid residue 393, which we used as a dominant negative form (HIF-1αDN). The hypoxia-induced activation of the RORα4 promoter was almost completely inhibited by HIF-1αDN (Fig. 3C). The transcription activated by the wild-type HIF-1α was also repressed efficiently in the cells cotransfected with HIF-1αDN under normoxia. Fig. 4A shows proteins binding to the region containing the HRE. Several nuclear proteins from normoxic and hypoxic cells showed identical patterns of DNA binding. Cold probe DNA competed completely with the binding of all of the proteins, but a specific oligonucleotide containing the HRE failed to compete with the binding of any protein. However, an EMSA experiment carried out using the HRE oligonucleotide showed that proteins bound specifically to the HRE are induced under hypoxia. An excess amount of the cold wild-type HRE successfully competed with the binding, but a mutated HRE did not, demonstrating the specificity of the binding. Additionally, the HRE-binding protein induced by hypoxia disappeared quickly after reoxygenation (data not shown). Another protein, which is present in both normoxic and hypoxic cells, was also found to bind specifically with the HRE. It is not clear at present whether this constitutive protein might be activating transcription factor or CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein), as has been demonstrated previously (32Kvietikova I. Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Gassmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To further confirm that HIF-1 binds to the RORα4 HRE, we performed a DNase I footprinting analysis using a probe from +40 to +341 with nuclear proteins from normoxic or hypoxic cells (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the result obtained in the EMSA experiments, no protein binding to the HRE region was detected with low amounts of nuclear proteins from either normoxic or hypoxic cells. However, the HRE did bind to protein when an increasing amount of the nuclear proteins was used, and the pattern differed between the hypoxic nuclear proteins and the normoxic nuclear proteins in that the HRE region protected by the normoxic nuclear proteins was relatively broad. Together with the results obtained in the transfection experiments, these observations indicate that the HIF-1 induced by hypoxia binds to the HRE and activates the transcription of the RORα4 promoter. HIF-1-induced Activation Requires Three GC-rich Elements— Hypoxia-inducible genes often require cis elements in addition to the HRE for their efficient activation by hypoxia (33Ebert S.N. Wong D.L.

In addition to the HRE, three other regions (Box1, Box2, and Box3) bound with protein(s) that are abundant and expressed constitutively in both normoxic and hypoxic cells (Fig. 4, A and C). The region between +160 and +250 is rich in GC and contains several GC-box-like sequences (Fig. 5), including a typical GC-box at +210, two GGGAGG (GA-box) sequences at +216 and +234, and three GGGTGG sequences at +171, +191, and +239. To address whether these three Boxes are involved in the hypoxia-induced activation of the RORα4 promoter, we analyzed the effects of their deletion on the HIF-1-dependent transcription. As shown in Fig. 6, deletion of Box3 (from +223 to +243) reduced the HIF-1-dependent transcription to about 50% of that seen with the wild-type DNA. Deletion of the region from +202 to +243 (deletion of the Box2 and Box3) resulted in a marked reduction of the transcription to about 20% of the control. A similar reduction in transcription was observed in a mutant lacking the region between +155 and +227 (deletion of the Box1 and Box2). In contrast, only a 50% reduction of the HIF-1-dependent transcription was detected on a mutant lacking the region from +155 to +215 (deletion of Box1 and Box2). Although the deletion from +155 to +215 removed both the GC-box and GA-box within the Box2, the ligation of an EcoRI linker created a new GGGAGG sequence in this reporter construct. The Box1 appeared to be dispensable, because deletion of the region between +155 and +178 did not significantly affect the HIF-1-dependent transcription.Fig. 6Cis elements required for HIF-1 dependent activation of the RORα4 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2036499203,"Subunits 6 and 8 of the mitochondrial ATPase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and translated from bicistronic mRNAs containing both reading frames. The stability of the two major species of ATP8/6 mRNA, which differ in the length of the 5′-untranslated region, depends on the expression of several nuclear-encoded factors. In the present study, the product of the gene designated AEP3 (open reading frame YPL005W) is shown to be required for stabilization and/or processing of both ATP8/6 mRNA species. In an aep3-disruptant strain, the shorter ATP8/6 mRNA was undetectable, and the level of the longer mRNA was reduced to ∼35% that of wild type. Localization of a hemagglutinin-tagged version of Aep3p showed that the protein is an extrinsic constituent of the mitochondrial inner membrane facing the matrix. Subunits 6 and 8 of the mitochondrial ATPase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and translated from bicistronic mRNAs containing both reading frames. The stability of the two major species of ATP8/6 mRNA, which differ in the length of the 5′-untranslated region, depends on the expression of several nuclear-encoded factors. In the present study, the product of the gene designated AEP3 (open reading frame YPL005W) is shown to be required for stabilization and/or processing of both ATP8/6 mRNA species. In an aep3-disruptant strain, the shorter ATP8/6 mRNA was undetectable, and the level of the longer mRNA was reduced to ∼35% that of wild type. Localization of a hemagglutinin-tagged version of Aep3p showed that the protein is an extrinsic constituent of the mitochondrial inner membrane facing the matrix.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, subunits 6, 8, and 9 of the F0 domain are encoded by the mitochondrial genome. The genes for subunits 6 and 8 are transcribed on a polycistronic RNA (Fig. 1) (1de Zamaroczy M. Bernardi G. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 47: 155-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Foury F. Roganti T. Lecrenier N. Purnelle B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) that includes the COX1 reading frame coding for subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase. In some strains, the initial transcript also includes ENS2, which encodes an optional DNA endonuclease (3Nakagawa K. Morishima N. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1977-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Processing of the initial transcript yields two major mRNAs containing both ATP8 and ATP6 (and ENS2, if present in the genome) (4Simon M. Faye G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 196: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 5′-end of the longer ATP8/6 mRNA is coincident with the 3′-end of the COX1 mRNA, whereas the 5′-end of the shorter mRNA maps to a site 600 nucleotides downstream from the 3′-end of the COX1 mRNA.The steady-state levels of ATP8/6 RNAs are affected by the products of three nuclear genes. Strains with mutations in both NCA2 and NCA3 have an aberrant stoichiometry of the F0 subunits (5Manon S. Guerin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), decreased levels of the longer ATP8/6 mRNA, and reduced amounts of Atp6p and Atp8p (6Camougrand N. Pelissier P. Velours G.

Genet. 1995; 27: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutations in the third gene, NAM1, result in greatly reduced amounts of both ATP8/6 mRNAs (8Groudinsky O. Bousquet I. Wallis M.G. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Here we describe the characterization of a fourth gene required for the stability of ATP8/6 mRNAs. This gene, which we have named AEP3, corresponds to ORF YPL005W in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). AEP3 was identified by a two-step analysis of unknown yeast proteins in the SGD designed to identify mitochondrial proteins involved in RNA metabolism. The same gene was also found in a previously described screen for respiratory-deficient pet mutants (9Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of Aep3p has been deduced from an analysis of mitochondrial RNA and protein expression profiles. Additionally, we have used an HA-tagged version of Aep3p to localize the protein to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Media, and Phenotypes—S. cerevisiae strains and their genotypes are listed in Table I.

Open table in a new tab The media used for growth of yeast were: YEPD (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, and 2% (w/v) glucose); YEPG (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 3% (v/v) glycerol); and WO (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids or ammonium sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) glucose, and other supplements depending on the auxotrophy of the strain). Solid media contained 2% (w/v) agar.Identification and Disruption of AEP3—AEP3 (ORF YPL005W) was identified by first screening unknown proteins in the SGD for sequences likely to have an amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences as predicted by the MitoProt algorithm (13Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). The protein sequences were then analyzed using the search algorithms BLAST and eMotif (14Altschul S.F.

AEP3 was amplified from nucleotides –151 to +1853 on chromosome XVI using PCR with the oligonucleotides 5′-AGTATTATTGGTTTCGGGCG and 5′-GTCCAAATGCCAGGGCAC. Total yeast cellular DNA was isolated by a rapid glass bead-vortexing method as described previously (16Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar). The amplified product was ligated into the plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The HIS3 gene from plasmid pUC18/HIS3 was digested with ApoI and ligated into the MfeI sites at +107 and +1487 of the AEP3 reading frame. Restriction analysis of the resultant plasmid indicated that the AEP3 and HIS3 reading frames had the same orientation. This aep3::HIS3 construct was digested with EcoRI, heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 30 min, and used to transform iLL20 (17Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar).In Vivo Labeling of Mitochondrial Translation Products—The wild type strain iLL20 and the aep3 deletion mutant iAP3H were grown to early stationary phase in liquid YEPD medium. The cells (A600 = 1.5) were harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with a buffer containing 2% glucose, 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6, 25 μg/ml histidine and 25 μg/ml leucine. The washed cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer solution. After 10-min incubation at 23 °C, cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 8 × 10–4m. The cells were incubated for an additional 5 min at 24 °C before addition of 40 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, specific activity = 1000 Ci/mmol). After 40 min at 24 °C, cells were isolated by centrifugation, suspended in 75 μl of 0.33 m NaOH, 1 m β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min and diluted with 500 μl of water and 575 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid. The suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, washed once with water, and dissolved in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar).Construction of AEP3-HA—To express Aep3p with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the carboxyl terminus, the two primers 5′-GCGAGCTCGGGACGATTCCATCGAAGCAG and 5′-GGCTCTAGATCAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAAACCTCCCCAACTATTCTCCTCTTTAC were used to amplify the gene from wild type yeast nuclear DNA. The product was digested with a combination of SacI and XbaI and ligated to the compatible sites of YIp351 (19Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) yielding plasmid pG100/-ST8. This construct contained 372 nucleotides of 5′ sequence plus the entire coding sequence of AEP3 fused to a short sequence coding for 7 amino acids constituting the HA tag. To integrate the fusion gene at the leu2 locus, iAP3H was transformed with pG100/ST8 linearized at the ClaI site of the LEU2 gene in YIp351. Respiratory competent and leucine prototrophic clones were checked for expression of the protein with an antibody against the HA epitope.Miscellaneous Procedures—Mitochondria were isolated by the method of Glick and Pon (20Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) for the localization of Aep3p. Enzyme assays and RNA extractions were done on mitochondria prepared by the method of Faye et al. (21Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) except that Zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku) was used instead of Glusulase to produce spheroplasts. RNA was extracted from ∼5 mg of isolated mitochondria using TRIzol reagent as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Mitochondrial RNAs (10 μg) were separated on a horizontal 1.25% (w/v) agarose gel in 1× TB buffer (83 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid). The RNAs were transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with the following end-labeled oligonucleotide probes: ATP6-dboII (5′-CCAAATAATAGTCTAATCTCAAATTGATCTAATGGTGATG), COB exon1-dbo (5′-CCCATATTTCATCAATAATTAATTGATGATGGTTGTGGTG), COX1-dboI (5′-AGTTGATGTAACTAAACATACTAACCCCATAGGTAATACT), and COX2-dbo (5′-TCAGGAATAACATATGATTCAAATTCAACAGTTTCACCAC). Hybridizations were carried out in 6× SSC, 10× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 50 μg/ml carrier DNA at 50 °C. The labeled probes were in molar excess relative to the mRNAs on the blot to ensure quantitative representation of the mRNAs. Blots were analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSaep3 Mutants Do Not Respire—Part of the ORF YPL005W (AEP3) reading frame was deleted and replaced with HIS3 in the wild type haploid strains LL20 and iLL20. The two strains have identical genotypes except that iLL20 has an intronless mitochondrial genome. The resultant mutants AP3H and iAP3H, with and without mitochondrial introns, respectively, were viable but unable to grow on the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol (data not shown). This growth phenotype, a hallmark of respiratory-deficient mutants, indicates a direct requirement of AEP3 for the support of respiration or a requirement of AEP3 for mtDNA stability. The retention of a wild type (rho+) mitochondrial genome in AP3H and iAP3H was tested by mating each strain to the rhoo tester aCB11rhoo. In these crosses, heterozygous diploid cells with a recessive nuclear aep3 mutation are respiratory competent if they contain a rho+ genome or are respiratory defective if they have mutations in or sustain a loss of mtDNA. The crosses indicated that ∼50% of the input AP3H and iAP3H cells had normal mitochondrial genomes (data not shown). These results confirm a direct requirement of AEP3 for respiratory competence but also indicate that aep3 mutations elicit instability of the mitochondrial DNA.The Intronless aep3 Mutant Has Reduced Levels of Cytochromes and Lacks Oligomycin-sensitive ATPase Activity—The failure of intronless mtDNA to suppress the aep3 null mutation strongly argues against a role of the encoded product in intron processing (8Groudinsky O. Bousquet I. Wallis M.G. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To simplify interpretation, all the biochemical data reported here were obtained with the intronless iAP3H mutant. Spectra of mitochondrial cytochromes in the Δaep3 mutant showed detectable cytochrome b and cytochrome a+a3 (Fig. 2). The wild type and mutant mitochondria were also assayed for NADH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase (Table II). Both NADH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase activities were reduced 7-fold in the mutant strain. The extent of reduction measured in the enzymatic assays mirrors the reduction seen in the cytochrome spectra and is partially attributable to the rho–/rhoo population (50–60%) in the culture used for the preparation of mitochondria. Although the aep3 mutant strain retained 15% of the enzyme activities, it did not respire at all, whereas leaky mitochondrial protein synthesis mutants, in which mitochondrial translation products and respiratory chain enzymes are down to less than 5% of wild type levels, grow slowly on rich glycerol/ethanol medium. 2A. Tzagoloff, unpublished observation. Fig. 2Spectra of mitochondrial cytochromes in the wild type and the aep3 mutant strains. Mitochondria were prepared from iLL20 (wild type) and iAP3H aep3 mutant grown to early stationary phase in YEPD. The percentage of rho+ cells in the culture of the mutant was 40%. Mitochondria were extracted with potassium deoxycholate at a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml as described previously (23Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Difference spectra of the reduced (sodium dithionite) versus oxidized (potassium ferricyanide) extracts were recorded at room temperature. The α absorption bands corresponding to cytochromes a and a3 have maxima at 603 nm (a), of cytochrome b (b) at 560 nm and of cytochrome c and c1 (c) at 550 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIRespiratory and ATPase activities of mitochondria from wild type and the aep3 null mutant strainStrainrho-/oSpecific activitiesNADH-c reductaseCytochrome oxidaseATPase-oligomycin+oligomycin%μmoles/min/mgiLL20<11.75 ± 0.151.05 ± 0.015.80 ± 0.31.41 ± 0.05iAP3H550.25 ± 0.030.152 ± 0.051.80 ± 0.091.75 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab The instability of mtDNA in aep3 mutants combined with their pleiotropic deficiency of respiratory chain components is characteristic of ATPase mutants (24Ackerman S.

The requirement of AEP3 for expression of the proton translocating ATPase was confirmed by assay of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase in isolated mitochondria, which showed the aep3 mutant was completely deficient in this activity (Table II). The loss of oligomycin sensitivity suggested a defect in coupling of proton translocation by F0 to ATP synthesis/hydrolysis by F1. The defect may result from either the loss of subunits in the F0 unit necessary for binding to F1 and oligomycin-sensitivity, or the loss of a factor required for assembly of F0.aep3 Mutant Lacks Atp6p and Atp8p—The nature of the biochemical lesion in the aep3 mutant was further analyzed by determining whether the lack of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity was the result of a loss of one or more of the mitochondrially encoded subunits of F0. Mitochondrial translation products were pulse-labeled in vivo in the presence of the cytoplasmic translational inhibitor cycloheximide, and total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Subunit 9 (Atp9p) was unaffected in the mutant strain, but both subunits 6 (Atp6p) and 8 (Atp8p) were almost undetectable. The absence of these two F0 constituents explains the lack of inhibition of the ATPase by oligomcyin and the resultant respiratory deficiency of the mutant strain.Fig. 3In vivo labeling of mitochondrial gene products. Mitochondrial translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of the cytoplasmic translation inhibitor cycloheximide essentially as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 m urea and glycerol to maximize separation of the ATPase subunit 6 from Cox3p, and on a 17.5% gel to improve the separation of ATPase subunits 8 and 9. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and exposed to x-ray film. The mitochondrial translation products are identified on the left of each gel. In this experiment, the percentage of rho+ cells was 48%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ATP8/6 mRNA Is Destabilized in the aep3 Mutant—Since subunits 6 and 8 of F0 are translated from the same bicistronic mRNAs, the absence of both proteins in the aep3 mutant suggested that Aep3p may function in processing of the COX1/ATP8/6 precursor RNA or in stabilizing the processed ATP8/6 mRNAs. This was examined by Northern analysis of mitochondrial RNAs in the parental wild type and the aep3 mutant strain. The relative levels in the aep3 mutant strain of the ATP9, COX3, and VAR1 mRNAs normalized to COX2 mRNA were not significantly different from those of wild type, whereas the level of COB mRNA was reduced by ∼30% in the mutant strain (Table III). However, a probe specific for ATP8/6 showed that the aep3 mutant lacked the shorter ATP8/6 mRNA and had only 34% of wild type levels of the longer ATP8/6 mRNA (Fig. 4). The much larger transcript detected in the aep3 null mutant by both the ATP8/6- and the COX1-specific probes corresponds to the unprocessed COX1/ATP8/6 precursor (Fig. 4). The COX1 probe also detected wild type levels of mature COX1 mRNA in the mutant (Fig. 4). These data suggest that the principal effect of the aep3 mutation is on the stability of the ATP8/6 mRNAs. The accumulation of some COX1/ATP8/6 precursor RNA in the mutant, however, indicates that absence of Aep3p also affects cleavage of this initial transcript.Table IIIQuantitation of mitochondrial mRNA levels in the aep3 mutant strainmRNAWild type mRNA in aep3 mutant%ATP8/6 long34ATP8/6 short0ATP9104COB68COX193COX2100COX390VAR192 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Northern blot analysis of mitochondrial transcripts in the aep3 mutant strain. Approximately 5 μg of mitochondrial RNA of the wild type strain iLL20 and the aep3 mutant iAP3H was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.25% agarose gel. The RNAs were blotted onto Nytran and hybridized separately to probes specific for individual mitochondrial transcripts. Blots were analyzed on a PhosphorImager. Although the levels of all aep3 mitochondrial RNAs were lower than wild type due to the presence of rho–/o cells in the culture, the relative levels of COX3, ATP9, and VAR1 mRNAs were not significantly different than those of wild type when normalized to the level of COX2 mRNA (Table III). The concentrations of the transcripts in the mutant relative to wild type were 34% for the long ATP8/6 mRNA, 0% for the short ATP8/6 mRNA, and 93% for COX1 mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Localization of Aep3p—iAP3H/ST8, an aep3 mutant expressing Aep3p-HA from a chromosomally integrated fusion gene, was fractionated into mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions. A monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope detected a protein of ∼66 kDa in mitochondria but not in the post-mitochondrial supernatant (Fig. 5A). The size of the protein measured by SDS-PAGE is consistent with the mass of Aep3p calculated from the gene sequence. The failure of the antibody to detect this protein in mitochondria of wild type yeast (not shown) confirms the identity of the protein detected by the HA antibody as Aep3p-HA. Aep3p-HA was recovered in the insoluble membrane fraction after sonic disruption of mitochondria. Cytochrome b2, a soluble component of the intermembrane space, was almost quantitatively released into the soluble fraction. These results indicate that Aep3p is associated with the membrane or is in a complex of a sufficiently large mass to co-sediment with the membrane fraction. The latter possibility was excluded by centrifugation of the membrane vesicles through a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Aep3p banded with Cox2p, a cytochrome oxidase marker for the mitochondrial inner membranes, at the 30/50% sucrose interface (Fig 5C). In this gradient, large protein complexes band at the higher density defined by the 60/80% sucrose interface (27Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 187: 4986-4990Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Fig. 5Solubility properties of Aep3p.A, the aep3 mutant iAP3H/ST8, with an integrated copy of the AEP3-HA fusion gene, was grown to early stationary phase in liquid YEPD and mitochondria (Mit), and postmitochondrial supernatant (PMS) were prepared (20Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (1 ml of a suspension at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml of 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA (STE) were disrupted by sonic irradiation for 10 s with a Branson microprobe at half-maximal intensity. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant (Sup) was collected, and the pellet consisting of submitochondrial membrane vesicles (SMP) was suspended in the starting volume of STE. Samples corresponding to 50 μg of protein were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the mouse monoclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin antigen (Covance Research Products, Inc., Berkeley, CA) to detect HA-tagged Aep3p (Aep3p-HA). The blot was also probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against yeast cytochrome b2 (Cyt. b2). Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized with the Super Signal Kit (Pierce Chemical Co.) after a second reaction with peroxidase coupled to either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit γ-globulin. The migration of molecular mass standards is marked in the left-hand margin. B, iAP3H/ST8 mitochondria (0.5 ml), at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml, were mixed with an equal volume of 0.2 m sodium carbonate, 10 mm EDTA and incubated on ice for 30 min. Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min, the membrane pellet (C-Pellet) was washed and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer. The supernatant (C-Sup) was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. The protein pellet was rinsed with water and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples of each fraction, equivalent to 40 μg of starting mitochondrial protein, were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose by electrophoresis. The blot was probed with antibodies against the hemagglutinin antigen (Aep3p-HA) and Mss51p as in part A. C, submitochondrial particles obtained in part A were layered on top of a discontinuous gradient built from equal volumes of 80%, 60%, 50%, 30%, and 20% sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged for 3 h at 65,000 rpm in a Beckman SW65 rotor, fractionated into 12 equal size fractions, and analyzed for the distribution of Aep3p-HA and subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase as in part A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To ascertain if Aep3p is an integral or extrinsic membrane protein, mitochondria were extracted with alkaline carbonate. Under the conditions used, 50% of Aep3p was solubilized, indicating that it is not an integral membrane protein (Fig. 5B). Mss51p and Cox4p (not shown), both extrinsic proteins of the inner membrane, were solubilized to approximately the same extent as Aep3p by the carbonate treatment.The submitochondrial localization of Aep3p was examined by testing its susceptibility to proteinase K in mitochondria and mitoplasts. Aep3p was protected against protease digestion in both mitochondria and mitoplasts (Fig. 6). The substantial decrease of cytochrome b2 in the mitoplasts indicated that the hypotonic treatment resulted in efficient lysis of the outer membrane. This was also supported by the loss of Sco1p in the proteinase K-treated mitoplasts. Sco1p is an intrinsic constituent of the inner membrane facing the intermembrane space (28Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rödel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The intactness of the inner membrane in the mitoplast preparation was confirmed by the resistance of the matrix protein α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase to proteinase K digestion. These results together with the solubility properties of Aep3p indicate that it is an extrinsic inner membrane protein facing the matrix side of the membrane.Fig. 6Localization of Aep3p. iAP3H/ST8 mitochondria were suspended in 0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and diluted with either four volumes of 0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 (MT) or with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 (MP) in the presence and absence of 100 μg proteinase K/ml (Prot.

The samples were centrifuged, the pellets were rinsed with water and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, and the pH was adjusted prior to separation on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transfer to nitrocellulose.

https://openalex.org/W2037635640,"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) results from mutations affecting different subunits of the mitochondrial branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. In this study, we identified seven novel mutations in MSUD patients from Israel. These include C219W-α (TGC to TGG) in the E1α subunit; H156Y-β (CAT to TAT), V69G-β (GTT to GGT), IVS 9 del[-7:-4], and 1109 ins 8bp (exon 10) in the E1β subunit; and H391R (CAC to CGC) and S133stop (TCA to TGA) affecting the E2 subunit of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Recombinant E1 proteins carrying the C219W-α or H156Y-β mutation show no catalytic activity with defective subunit assembly and reduced binding affinity for cofactor thiamin diphosphate. The mutant E1 harboring the V69G-β substitution cannot be expressed, suggesting aberrant folding caused by this mutation. These E1 mutations are ubiquitously associated with the classic phenotype in homozygous-affected patients. The H391R substitution in the E2 subunit abolishes the key catalytic residue that functions as a general base in the acyltransfer reaction, resulting in a completely inactive E2 component. However, wild-type E1 activity is enhanced by E1 binding to this full-length mutant E2 in vitro. We propose that the augmented E1 activity is responsible for robust thiamin responsiveness in homozygous patients carrying the H391R E2 mutation and that the presence of a full-length mutant E2 is diagnostic of this MSUD phenotype. The present results offer a structural and biochemical basis for these novel mutations and will facilitate DNA-based diagnosis for MSUD in the Israeli population.

The BCKD complex catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation (Reaction 1) of three branched-chain α-ketoacids (BCKAs) derived from branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine (1Chuang D.T. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Medicine. Vol. 5. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 393-396Google Scholar). R-CO-COOH+CoA-SH+NAD+→R-CO-S-CoA+CO2↑+NADH+H+REACTION 1 The metabolic block in the BCKD complex results in the inability of MSUD patients to degrade BCKA. The elevated BCKA levels produce severe clinical consequences including often-fatal ketoacidosis, mental retardation, and neurological impairment. There are presently five known MSUD clinical phenotypes (i.e. classic, intermediate, intermittent, thiamin-responsive, and E3-deficient forms) (2Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Vogelstein K.B. Childs B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). The classic form with the most severe phenotype, was originally reported by Menke et al. in 1954 (3Menke J.H. Hurst P.L. Craig J.M. Pediatrics. 1954; 14: 462-466PubMed Google Scholar) and manifests within the first 2 weeks of life by poor feeding, lethargy, seizures, coma, and death if left untreated. The classic form accounts for 75% of MSUD patients (1Chuang D.T. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Medicine. Vol. 5. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 393-396Google Scholar). Intermediate MSUD is associated with progressive mental retardation and developmental delay without a history of catastrophic illness. An intermittent form of MSUD has normal levels of BCAA as well as normal intelligence and development until a stress such as infection precipitates metabolic decompensation with ketoacidosis. Thiamin-responsive MSUD is similar to the intermediate or intermittent phenotype but responds to pharmacological doses of thiamin with normalization of the BCAA levels (2Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Vogelstein K.B. Childs B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). The E3-deficient MSUD is caused by defects in the dihydrolipamide dehydrogenase (E3) component of the BCKD complex, which is common to that of the pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes. Patients with E3 deficiency display a combined dysfunction of the three α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (4Taylor J. Robinson B.H. Sherwood W.G. Pediatr. Res. 1978; 12: 60-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two prevailing mutations (G229C and Y335stop) in the E3 gene have been identified in the Ashkenazi Jewish community in Israel (5Shaag A. Saada A. Berger I. Mandel H. Joseph A. Feigenbaum A. Elpelg O.N. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 82: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Most of the Israeli patients who were homozygous for the G229C E3 mutation presented in early childhood or later with recurrent episodes of vomiting, encephalopathy, and prolonged prothrombin time, occasionally associated with lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis. Patients who were compound-heterozygous for these two mutations presented neonatally with more severe sequelae. The mammalian BCKD multienzyme complex is a 4 × 106-dalton metabolic machine organized around a cubic core comprising 24 lipoate-bearing dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2) subunits, to which multiple copies of branched-chain α-ketoacid decarboxylase (E1), E3, a specific kinase, and a specific phosphatase are attached through ionic interactions. The kinase and the phosphatase are responsible for the regulation of BCKD complex by a reversible phosphorylation (inactivation)/dephosphorylation (activation) cycle (6Harris R.A. Hawes J.W. Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Sato J. Jaskiewicz J. Hurley T.D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 271-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The E1 component is a thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme consisting of two E1α and two E1β subunits. The E3 component is a homodimeric flavoprotein. There are in total six genetic loci that encode subunits of the BCKD complex. Mutations in the four different catalytic subunits (E1α, E1β, E2, and E3) have been described in MSUD patients (2Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Vogelstein K.B. Childs B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). Genetic subtypes of MSUD have been proposed to indicate the altered subunit in the BCKD complex (2Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Vogelstein K.B. Childs B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). These include type IA MSUD affecting the E1α subunit, type IB affecting the E1β subunit, type II affecting the E2 subunit, and type III affecting the E3 subunit. Types IV and V, which have not been reported, are reserved for MSUD in which the kinase and the phosphatase, respectively, are affected. Except for type II and III MSUD, which are linked to the thiamin-responsive (2Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Vogelstein K.B. Childs B.

Res. 1978; 12: 60-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), respectively, a tight correlation between a specific genetic subtype and a particular clinical phenotype of MSUD has not been demonstrated. Reaction steps catalyzed by the three enzyme components, based largely on those elucidated for the related pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (9Reed L.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1974; 7: 40-46Crossref Scopus (651) Google Scholar), are as follows. R-CO-COOH+E1-ThDP→E1-R-COH=ThDP+CO2↑E1-R-COH=ThDP+E2-[lipS2]→E2-[R-CO-S-lipSH]+E1-ThDPE2-[R-CO-S-lipSH]+CoA-SH→R-CO-S-CoA+E2-[lip(SH)2]E2-[lip(SH)2]+E3-[FAD-S2]→E2-[lipS2]+E3-[FAD-(SH)2]E3-[FAD-(SH)2]+NAD+→E3-[FAD-S2]+NADH+H+Reactions 2–6 The E1 component binds ThDP and catalyzes a ThDP-mediated decarboxylation of α-ketoacids (Reaction 2), and subsequent reduction of the lipoyl moiety, which is covalently attached to E2 (Reaction 3). The lipoyl-bearing domain (LBD) carrying the S-acyldihydrolipoamide serves as a “swinging arm” (10Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) to transfer the acyl group from E1 to the E2 active site giving rise to acyl-CoA (Reaction 4). Finally, the E3 component with a tightly bound FAD moiety reoxidizes the dihydrolipoyl residue on E2 (Reaction 5) with NAD+ as the ultimate electron acceptor (Reaction 6). The overall reaction is the production of branched-chain acyl-CoA, CO2, and NADH from BCKAs (Reaction 1). We previously described two novel missense mutations in MSUD patients from the non-Jewish Druze kindred in Israel (11Wynn R.M. Chuang J.C. Sansaricq C. Mandel H. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36550-36556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The incidence of MSUD in Israel is relatively high, presumably as a result of consanguinity (12Chitayat D. Balbul A. Hani V. Mamer O.A. Clow C. Scriver C.R. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1992; 15: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Toward the goal of providing a wider spectrum of MSUD mutations in this region, we continue to analyze cell cultures derived from Israeli patients. In the present study, we report seven additional MSUD mutations in the Israeli population, which affect the E1α (type IA), E1β (type IB), and E2 (type II) subunits of the BCKD complex. Among them are novel type IA and type IB homozygous missense mutations that impede subunit assembly of the E1 component and nullify ThDP-mediated decarboxylation of BCKAs. A type II homozygous point mutation H391R in the E2 subunit involves the key catalytic residue that functions as a general base in the acyltransfer reaction catalyzed by E2 (13Griffin T.S. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13174-13180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Meng M. Chuang D.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12879-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A biochemical mechanism is proposed to explain the unequivocal thiamin-responsive phenotype presented by the Israeli type II MSUD patients. The genetic and biochemical information presented here provides new insights into structure and function of the human BCKD complex, and will facilitate DNA-based detection of these MSUD alleles in the Israeli population. Cell Lines and Cell Cultures—Blood samples (15 ml) were withdrawn from classic MSUD patients B.R, W.A., D.M., K.Y., T.G., and C.R. as well as Druze thiamin-responsive patients H.C. and H.S., all from Israel. Lymphoblasts were prepared from blood samples by infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, and lymphoblastoid cell cultures were grown and assayed for the decarboxylation of α-keto[1-14C]isovalerate by intact cells as described previously (15Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 413-424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide Sequencing for MSUD Mutations—The first-strand E1α cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA prepared from patients' cells using the primer 5′-GAAGACAGTGGTGTGCTGTC-3′ (cDNA sequence 1461-1442) and the Omniscript™ reverse transcriptase from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). The subsequent PCR amplification was carried out using the forward primer 5′-CGGACCGCTGAGTGGTTG-3′ (positions 1-18) and the reverse primer 5′-CTTAGAGTGGGGCTACCTCTCG-3′ (positions 1425-1404). For the first-strand E1β cDNA synthesis, the primer 5′-GTAGAACTTTTCAGCCAATATCATGATGG-3′ (positions 1367-1339) was employed. The first round PCR was carried out using the forward primer 5′-GTGCGGCTGCATAGCCTGAG-3′ (positions 8-27) and the reverse primer: 5′-AAAAGAGGTAAGTCGGAGGA-3′ (positions 1312-1293). To amplify the 5′ segment of the E1β cDNA, a second round PCR was performed using the forward primer 5′-ATGGCGGTTGTAGCGGC-3′ (positions 48-64) and the reverse primer 5′-CCAGGCAACTAGAGTAACATC-3′ (positions 878-858). The 3′ region of the E1β cDNA was amplified in a parallel second round PCR utilizing the forward primer 5′-ATACCCCATTGTGTGAACAAGGAATTGTTG-3′ (positions 409-438) and as a reverse primer the above first-stand primer for the E1β cDNA. To synthesize the first-strand E2 cDNA, the primer 5′-CAGCTAGGGTTTACATACTC-3′ (positions 1523-1504) was utilized. The ensuing PCR amplification was performed with the forward primer 5′-TCCGGGGTAAGATGGCTG-3′ (positions 5-22) and the reverse primer 5′-GCTCAAAAAGTTCAAGAATGTCTTATCAGT-3′ (positions 1496-1467). PCR products were sequenced with an ABI Prism™ model 377 automated DNA sequencer manufactured by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Production of Wild-type and Mutant Proteins—The pTrcHisB expression plasmid (Invitrogen) for N-terminally His6-tagged wild-type E1 was constructed as described previously (16Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The same plasmids carrying MSUD mutations were produced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type and mutant E1 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli by co-transformation with the pGroESL plasmid over expressing chaperonins GroEL and GroES, as described previously (17Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Song J.L. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 179-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His6-tagged wild-type and mutant E1 were purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and Resource Q and Superdex-200 columns (17Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Song J.L. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 179-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used for biochemical studies without removal of the His6 tag. The E2 24-mer was expressed in XL1-Blue cells and lipoylated in vitro with bacterial lipoyl ligase as described previously (19Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 192-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C-terminal His6-tagged E2 domain constructs LBD2 (residues 1-99) containing the lipoyl domain and the C-terminal linker and the di-domain (DD) (residues 1-167) containing the LBD and subunit-binding domain (SBD) were prepared as described previously (20Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36905-36908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Lipoylated LBD2 (lip-LBD2) and DD (lip-DD) were prepared as described above. To produce the SBD, a tobacco-etch virus protease site (LENLYFQ↓S) with a nucleotide sequence of 5′-ctcgagaatctttattttcaatca-3′ was inserted into the linker between the lipoyl-bearing and subunit binding domains. The purified C-terminally His6-tagged DD was digested with the tobacco-etch virus protease, and the SBD was extracted by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Assay for Activity of the Reconstituted BCKD Complex—The BCKD complex was reconstituted with E1, lipoylated E2 (lip-E2), and E3 at a molar ratio of 12:1:55, in which lip-E2 exists as a 24-mer as described previously (19Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 192-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NAD+, 0.4 mm CoA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm ThDP, and 4 mm sodium α-ketoisovalerate. The oxidative decarboxylation of α-ketoisovalerate catalyzed by the reconstituted complex (Reaction 1) at 30 °C was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 340 nm. Assays for Activities of Individual E1 and E2 Components—The decarboxylation catalyzed by the isolated E1 component (Reaction 2) was assayed with α-ketoisovalerate as a substrate in the presence of an artificial electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) (Re-action 7) as described previously (21Lau K.S. Cooper A.J.L. Chuang D.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). R-CO-COOH+DCPIP(oxidized)+H2O→R-COOH+CO2↑+DCPIP(reduced)+H+Reaction 7 The assay mixture contained 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ThDP, and 0.1 mm DCPIP. The rate of decarboxylation at 30 °C was measured by monitoring the reduction of the dye at 600 nm. The acyltransferase activity (Reaction 4) of E2 was assayed using a model reaction (Reaction 8) with [1-14C]isovaleryl-CoA and dihydrolipoamide (Lip(SH)2) as substrates. [1-14C]R-CO-S-CoA+Lip(SH)2⇄[1-14C]R-S-Lip-SH+CoAReaction 8 The assay mixture contained 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 2.5 mmdl-dihydrolipoamide, and 2.5 mm [1-14C]isovaleryl-CoA. The reaction product S-[1-14C]isovaleryl dihydrolipoamide (R-S-Lip-SH) was extracted with benzene as also described previously (22Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Western Blotting of Cell Lysates—Homogenates from cultured lymphoblasts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). After blocking with a phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, these membranes were probed with either anti-E2 or anti-E1 (with titers against both E1α and E1β subunits) antibodies each at a 1:500 dilution. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing the membranes with the same buffer containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The bound antibodies were detected with 125I-protein A as described previously (15Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 413-424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding Measurements Based on Tryptophan Fluorescence Quenching—Steady-state fluorescence quenching upon ThDP binding (23Hennig J. Kern G. Neef H. Bisswanger H. Hubner G. Bisswanger H. Schellenberger A. Biochemistry and Physiology of Thiamin Diphosphate Enzymes. A. u. C. Intemann, Prien, Germany1966: 243-251Google Scholar) to wild-type and mutant E1 was measured using a Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences LS50 B luminescence spectrometer as described previously (24Wynn R.M. Machius M. Chuang J.L. Li J. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43402-43410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities were recorded at 25 °C at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and an emission wavelength of 335 nm. Slit widths were set at 5 nm for both excitation and emission. A 290-nm cut-off emission filter was installed to reduce light scattering effects. Protein concentrations for E1 (A280 = 1.14 mg-1 ml·cm-1) and ThDP (A235 = 11,300 m-1 cm-1,pH >7.0) were determined spectrophotometrically. The concentration for all protein samples was 0.23 μm (as heterotetramers) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. The binding data were fitted by nonlinear regression using the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Essex Junction, VT) according to Equation 1 describing a bimolecular reaction (25Nemeria N. Yan Y. Zhang Z. Brown A.M. Arjunan P. Furey W. Guest J.R. Jordan F. J. Biol.

Maliwal B.P. Cherek H. Balter A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1741-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), F0 is the fluorescence intensity prior to the addition of ThDP, ΔFmax is the maximal fluorescence change, Kd is the dissociation constant, and [ThDP] is the concentration of ThDP in the cuvette. The parameters determined by the fitting procedure were ΔFmax and Kd. Treatment of Mutant E1 Proteins with Natural Osmolyte Trimethylamine N-Oxide—Wild type or mutant E1 proteins (200 μg/ml) were incubated with different concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) at 23 °C for 16 h in buffer A that contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm ThDP, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 m lysine, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Activity of the BCKD complex reconstituted with TMAO-treated wild-type or mutant E1 was assayed as described above. Clinical Phenotypes—B.R., W.A., D.M., and K.Y. of Israeli origin manifested the classic MSUD phenotype as described above. T.G. and C.R. were from the Druze kindred in Israel, who suffered also from the classic MSUD phenotype with a turbulent neonatal presentation. Both exhibited mild to moderate developmental retardation with leukodystrophy in brain MRI. Furthermore, both patients had recurrent encephalopathic episodes during viral infections or suspected dietary noncompliance. T.G. underwent hemodialysis at age 2 and 4, which may have also resulted from dietary noncompliance. H.C. is the third child of first generation Arabs. He was delivered uneventfully after a normal pregnancy. The parents reported irritability of the child since the first week of life. Brain MRI reveals leukodystrophy, which in combination with elevated levels of BCAAs led to the diagnosis of MSUD. The patient underwent hemodialysis and was placed on a MSUD formula supplemented with thiamin at the dosage of 100 mg/day. The BCAA levels decreased to normal after 3 days. On follow-ups, the plasma BCAA levels remained in the normal range (50-100 nmol/ml) for the next 4 years. The patient consumed 4 times the leucine levels that were allowed for MSUD patients, but during acute infections his BCAA and alloisoleucine levels rose only slightly above the normal range. At age 5, he had spastic cerebral palsy and his IQ was 80. H.S. was also born uneventfully after a normal pregnancy. Parents of H.S. and H.C. were first-degree cousins; therefore, dietary restriction was instituted for H.S after birth. She was diagnosed with MSUD at 2 days of age, and thiamin supplement (100 mg/day) was added to the restricted diet. At 1 week of age, H.S. was discharged and given breast milk at home. Three days later, she was readmitted with vomiting, apathy, and encephalopathy with the plasma leucine level at 1,800 nmol/ml, and underwent hemodialysis. Since this episode, the regiment of restricted diet with thiamin supplements was reinstated and maintained. At 18 months of age, H.C. showed normal growth and development. Identification of the Affected BCKD Subunit in MSUD Patients—Since the human BCKD complex consisted of six different subunits, it was necessary for mutational analysis to identify which subunit was affected in the MSUD patient of interest. Homogenates of cultured lymphoblasts from the eight Israeli patients were subjected to Western blotting using antibodies against E1 (both E1α and E1β subunits) or E2 as a probe. Cells from the classic patient B.R. showed reduced levels of both the E1α and the E1β subunit, with the level of the E2 subunit in the normal range. Levels of both E1α and E1β subunits were below the detection limit in cells from classic patients W.A., D.M., and K.Y. The data strongly suggested that either the E1α or the E1β locus was affected in these Israeli MSUD patients. Individual E1 subunits are not stable in cells, and a mutation that impedes the stability of either the E1α or E1β subunit usually results in reduced levels or the absence of both subunits in cells from MSUD patients (7Fisher C.W. Chuang J.L. Griffin T.A. Lau K.S. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3448-3453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of both E1 subunits were normal in thiamin-responsive patients H.C. and H.S. as well as classic patients T.G. and C.R. In contrast, the E2 protein level was reduced in H.S. and H.C. compared with the wild type and was absent in T.G. and C.R., implicating that the E2 locus was affected in these MSUD patients. Novel MSUD Mutations in the BCKD Complex—Samples of total RNA isolated from cells of MSUD patients were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers corresponding to the cDNA sequence of the affected subunit. Nucleotide sequencing identified mutations in different subunits of the BCKD complex. All mutations in mRNA were confirmed by sequencing of the corresponding gene of the human BCKD complex in these patients. Table I shows seven novel MSUD mutations (types IA, IB, and II) identified in the eight Israeli patients investigated. A homozygous C to G type IA missense mutation C219W-α (TGC → TGG) is present in classic patient B.R. Two homozygous type IB mutations, H156Y-β (CAT → TAT) and V69G-β (GTT → GGT), occur in classic patients W.A. and D.M., respectively. Another classic patient, K.Y., harbors two compound heterozygous type IB alleles: a 4-base pair deletion in intron 9 (IVS9 del[-7:-4], resulting in the deletion of entire exon 10, and an 8-base pair insertion in exon 10 (1,109 ins 8bp) that causes a frameshift beginning at residue Glu304-β. Two type II missense mutations were also detected. The homozygous H391R substitution (CAC → CGC) in the E2 subunit is present in related thiamin-response patients H.C. and H.S. The homozygous S133stop (TCA → TGA) in the E2 subunit is detected in classic patients T.G. and C.R.Table INovel mutations in subunits of the BCKD complex in Israeli MSUD patientsPatientGenetic subtypeAltered subunitResidual proteinMSUD alleleGene/protein alterationGenotypeClinical phenotypeB.R.IAE1aYesC219W-αTGC to TGG−/−ClassicW.A.IBE1bNoH156Y-βCAT to TAT−/−ClassicD.M.IBE1bNoV69G-βGTT to GGT−/−ClassicK.Y.IBE1bNoIVS 9 del [−7:−4]aIVS, intervening sequence or intron; intronic deletion beginning at 7 bases and ending at 4 bases upstream of the intron 9/exon 10 junction (see Ref. 30 for nomenclature).Exon 10 deleted+/−Classic1,109 ins 8bp (exon 10)bins, insertion; 8-bp insertion at base 1,109 of the human E1β cDNA sequence corresponding to exon 10 (GenBank accession number U51015).Frameshift at Glu304+/−ClassicH.C.IIE2YesH391RCAC to CGC−/−Thiamin-responsiveH.S.IIE2YesH391RCAC to CGC−/−Thiamin-responsiveT.G.IIE2NoS133stopTCA to TGA−/−ClassicC.R.IIE2NoS133stopTCA to TGA−/−Classica IVS, intervening sequence or intron; intronic deletion beginning at 7 bases and ending at 4 bases upstream of the intron 9/exon 10 junction (see Ref. 30Ad Hoc Committee on Mutation NomenclatureHum.

https://openalex.org/W2006115876,"Exogenous expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT, in a normal human foreskin fibroblast cell strain resulted in telomerase activity and an extended proliferative lifespan prior to a period of crisis. Three immortalized cell lines with stably maintained telomere lengths were established from cells that escaped crisis. Each of these cultures underwent a significant downregulation of p16INK4a expression due to gene deletion events. One cell line also acquired mutations in both alleles of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Downregulation of p16INK4a and loss of wild-type p53 expression occurred after escape from crisis, so these mutations are most likely not required for immortalization of these cells but rather were selected for during continuous growth in vitro. These findings emphasize the need for caution in the use of hTERT-immortalized cells in studies of normal cell biology or in tissue engineering and the need to monitor for genetic instability and the accumulation of mutations in both the p16INK4a/pRb and p53 pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2000140392,"Genetic instability caused by mutations in the p53 gene is generally thought to be due to a loss of the DNA damage response that controls checkpoint functions and apoptosis. Cells with mutant p53 exhibit high levels of homologous recombination (HR). This could be an indirect consequence of the loss of DNA damage response or p53 could have a direct role in HR. Here, we report that p53−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit higher levels of the RAD51 protein and increased level of spontaneous RAD51 foci Agents that stall replication forks, for example, hydroxyurea (HU), potently induce HR repair and RAD51 foci. To test if the increase in RAD51 foci in p53−/− MEFs was due to an increased level of damage during replication, we measured the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in p53+/+ and p53−/− MEFs following treatments with HU. We found that HU induced DSBs only in p53−/− MEFs, indicating that p53 is involved in a pathway to protect stalled replication forks from being collapsed into a substrate for HR. Also, p53 is upregulated in response to agents that inhibit DNA replication, which supports our hypothesis. Finally, we observed that the DSBs produced in p53−/− MEFs did not result in a permanent arrest of replication and that they were repaired. Altogether, we suggest that the effect of p53 on HR and RAD51 levels and foci can be explained by the idea that p53 suppresses formation of recombinogenic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1995277208,"Pre-B cell leukemia transcription factors (PBXs) act as cofactors in the transcriptional regulation mediated by Homeobox proteins during embryonic development and cellular differentition. PBX1 protein is expressed throughout murine embryonic development, and its deletion in mice disrupts chondrogenesis. PBX protein levels are also increased in mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation. To elucidate the role of PBX proteins in this process, we stably overexpressed PBX1b antisense mRNA in P19 cells (PBX1b-AS cells). PBX1b-AS cells did not differentiate to neuronal or endodermal cells following treatment with RA suggesting PBX proteins are required for both processes. Furthermore we demonstrated that PBX proteins regulate the RA-dependent induction in the mRNA levels of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and Decorin (DCN) in P19 cells using both PBX1b-AS cells and PBX1 small interfering RNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated that PBX proteins directly bind to the promoter of <i>Bmp4</i> and <i>Dcn in vivo</i> in a RA-dependent fashion. In addition, type I and type II BMP receptor mRNA levels were also increased in P19 cells following RA treatment; however, this was PBX-independent. Taken together these data demonstrate that PBX proteins are required for RA-induced differentiation of P19 cells and that PBX proteins regulate the expression of BMP4 and DCN during this differentiation process."
https://openalex.org/W2048585633,"Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells plays a key role in the pathogenesis of several disorders of the vascular wall. Endothelin (ET), a vasoactive peptide that signals through a G protein-coupled receptor, has been linked to mitogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells, but the mechanistic details underlying this activity remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that ET-dependent mitogenesis in rat neonatal and adult aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells is accompanied by an increase (up to 10-fold) in CDK2 activity, but not CDK2 protein levels. This effect is blocked almost entirely by PD98059 and UO126, implying involvement of the MEK/ERK signal transduction cascade in the activation. Extracts of ET-treated cells phosphorylate the N terminus of WEE1, an inhibitory kinase, which negatively regulates CDK2 activity through phosphorylation at Tyr15, leading to a decrease in WEE1 activity and a reduction in levels of phospho-Tyr15 in the CDK2 protein. ET also increases expression and activity of CDC25A, the regulatory phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating Tyr15. All of these effects are reversible following treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059. ET also increases levels of CDC2 activity in these cells in association with a decrease in levels of phospho-Tyr15 on the CDC2 molecule. Phosphorylation of WEE1 is linked to ERK while phosphorylation of MYT1 (CDC2-selective inhibitory kinase) is tied to the ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). In summary, ET controls progression through the cell cycle, in part, by increasing CDK2 and CDC2 activity through the MEK/ERK/RSK signal transduction pathway(s). This results from the phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of two inhibitory kinases (WEE1 and MYT1) that tonically suppress CDK2 and CDC2 activity and activation of a phosphatase (CDC25A) that increases CDK2 activity.

Cell growth and division are important contributors to the pathogenesis of a number of cardiovascular disorders. Hypertension, atherosclerosis, and restenosis post-angioplasty are each characterized by aberrant proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the vascular wall. A detailed understanding of the regulatory controls that govern the growth response in these cells is critical if we are to understand the pathophysiology of these disorders at a level that will permit development of therapeutic strategies directed against specific molecular targets. CDK2 is the principal cyclin-dependent kinase acting at the G1/S transition. It pairs predominantly with cyclin E at this point in the cycle and is inhibited by several CDK inhibitors including p21/Cip, p27/Kip1, and p57/Kip2. Later in S phase cyclin A replaces cyclin E as the principal CDK2-associated cyclin. Activation of CDK2 is considered a key regulatory event in that it functions as a gatekeeper of the G1/S transition and plays a major role in determining whether a given cell will ultimately progress further in the cycle. In addition to the positive (i.e. cyclin E and A) and negative (i.e. p21, p27, and p57) regulatory mechanisms alluded to above, CDK2 is also heavily regulated through post-translational modification (e.g. phosphorylation). CDK-activating kinase (CAK), a heterotrimer of CDK7, cyclin H, and the regulatory molecule MAT1, phosphorylates CDK2 at Thr160 and promotes activation of the kinase (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Google Scholar). An inhibitory kinase, WEE1, negatively regulates CDK2 activity through phosphorylation at Tyr15 (2Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Google Scholar, 3Wu C.L. Kirley S.D. Xiao H. Chuang Y. Chung D.C. Zukerberg L.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7325-7332Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of WEE1 itself is associated with reductions in its intrinsic kinase activity (2Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Google Scholar, 4McGowan C.H. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2166-2175Google Scholar, 5Honda R. Tanaka H. Ohba Y. Yasuda H. Chromosome Res. 1995; 3: 300-308Google Scholar, 6Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol.

Countering this, a regulatory phosphatase CDC25A dephosphorylates Tyr15 and restores CDK2 activity (8Jinno S. Suto K. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1549-1556Google Scholar, 9Sebastian B. Kakizuka A. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3521-3524Google Scholar). Thus, the eukaryotic cell has developed several layers of seeming redundant regulatory control to limit access to the G1/S transition and subsequent mitotic activity. CDC2 (CDK1) takes over as the predominant CDK activity in early G2, continuing through the M phase of the cycle. It pairs predominantly with cyclin B, and to a lesser extent with cyclin A, and it is inhibited by p21/Cip. Like CDK2, CDC2 is heavily regulated through phosphorylation. CDC2 activity is suppressed through phosphorylation of Tyr15 by WEE1 and Thr14 and Tyr15 by a membrane-associated kinase called MYT1 (10Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Google Scholar). As noted for WEE1, phosphorylation of MYT1 is associated with reduction in its kinase activity (11Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Google Scholar). MYT1 derives its inhibitory activity both from direct suppression of CDC2 activity and from its ability to sequester CDC2 at cell membranes away from the nuclear compartment (12Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Google Scholar, 13Wells N.J. Watanabe N. Tokusumi T. Jiang W. Verdecia M.A. Hunter T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3361-3371Google Scholar). CDC25C is the regulatory phosphatase, which is responsible for removing MYT1-dependent phosphates and restoring CDC2 activity (14Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Google Scholar). A number of G protein coupled receptors including those for angiotensin, endothelin, and the α-adrenergic agonists possess both potent vasoconstrictor properties as well as pro-mitogenic activity in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ET, endothelin; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; RSK, ribosomal S6 kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, myelin basic protein; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase. (15Berk B.C. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 999-1030Google Scholar). Despite an abundance of information on the signal transduction events that are triggered by each of these receptors, we have only a limited understanding of the mechanisms that underlie their ability to promote VSMC proliferation. Jahan et al. (16Jahan H. Kobayashi S. Nishimura J. Kanaide H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 295: 261-269Google Scholar) have suggested that endothelin-1 (ET) and angiotensin II (AII) act as progression but not competence growth factors in VSMC. Competence growth factors (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor; PDGF) possess the ability to mobilize cells from G0 to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. According to Jahan et al. (16Jahan H. Kobayashi S. Nishimura J. Kanaide H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 295: 261-269Google Scholar), endothelin, and angiotensin II have no effect on cells positioned in G0, yet they stimulate progression from the competent G1 phase into S phase of the cell cycle. We (17Chen S. Gardner D.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 653-662Google Scholar) and others (18Morey A.K. Pedram A. Razandi M. Prins B.A. Hu R.M. Biesiada E. Levin E.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3330-3339Google Scholar, 19Whelchel A. Evans J. Posada J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 589-596Google Scholar) have shown that activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) appears to be important for ET-dependent mitogenic activity in VSMC. Given the progression-promoting properties of endothelin noted above, we have focused our attention on the ability of the MEK/ERK system to signal the progression of VSMC across the G1-S transition. In the present study we have determined that progression across this transition involves an ERK-dependent stimulation of CDK2 activity. This results from an early MEK/ERK-dependent phosphorylation and neutralization of the inhibitory kinase WEE1 and a delayed MEK/ERK-dependent activation of a stimulatory phosphatase CDC25A.

Synthesis of the recombinant proteins was induced with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-galactoside for 6 h. The cells were harvested, resuspended with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, 50 ml buffer/tablet) and sonicated. The supernatant was incubated with GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for2hat4° C. The slurry was loaded onto a column and washed with 3 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm DTT and 0.1% Triton-X. GST fusion proteins were eluted with 5 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mm DTT. Histidine-tagged PA-cyclin A (26Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G.

The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose and loaded onto a column. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole and then eluted with the same buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—Cells were treated with the agents indicated for different time intervals. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (17Chen S. Gardner D.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 653-662Google Scholar). 100 μg of supernatant protein was incubated with 1 μg of anti-CDK2, anti-CDC2, anti-cyclin A, anti-cyclin E, anti-CDK4, anti-CDK6, anti-CDK7, anti-WEE1, anti-RSK, anti-ERK2 or anti-JNK1 antibody and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 1–2 h at 4 C. Immunoprecipitates were carried out as described previously (17Chen S. Gardner D.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 653-662Google Scholar) with appropriate substrate (2 μg of histone 1 for measurement of CDK2, CDC2, cyclin A-, and cyclin E-associated kinase; 5 μg of GST-RB for measurement of CDK4 and CDK6; 5 μg of GST-CDK2 for measurement of CDK7; 5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) or GST-WEE1 for measurement of ERK; 5 μg of GST-c-JUN for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK); 2 μg of peptide RRRLSSLRA (27Kharabanda S. Saleem A. Sharfman T. Emoto Y. Weischelbaum R. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1994; 91: 5416-5420Google Scholar) and 5 μg of GST-MYT1 for measurement of RSK; and 5 μg of histidine-tagged PA cyclinA/GST-mCDK2 complex for measurement of WEE1). To assess phosphorylation of GST-WEE1 through endogenous kinase activity, ET-treated cells were lysed, and lysates were added directly to the kinase buffer. Reaction products were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels which were then dried and exposed to x-ray film. Transfection and Kinase Assay—Adults RASM cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and grown to ∼70% confluence. Transfection was carried out with Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) using a protocol recommended by the manufacturer. 9 μg of wild type ERK or dominant-negative MEK expression vector (25Feng W. Webb P. Nguyen P. Liu X. Li J. Karin M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 32-45Google Scholar) or control vector was introduced into each culture. The DNA-liposome suspension was incubated with the cultures for 5–6hat37 °C in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen). The suspension was then removed and replaced with serum substitute medium for the ensuing 48 h, at which point cells were treated with ET for 20 min. Cellular lysates were used for immunoprecipitation of ERK and WEE1. Their respective kinase activities were measured as described above. CDC25A Phosphatase Assay—Adult RASM Cells were exposed to PD098059 or vehicle for 1 h and then treated with ET for 24 h. 100 μg of cellular lysate was incubated with 1 μg of anti-CDC25A antibody and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 1–2 h at 4 C. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with lysis buffer and twice with phosphatase reaction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.33% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm DTT) (28Rice R.L. Rusnak J.M. Yokokawa F. Yokokawa S. Messner D.J. Boynton A.L. Wipf P. Lazo J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15965-15974Google Scholar) at 4 C. The reaction was initiated by adding 40 μm O-methylfluorescein monophosphate (OMFP) in 150 μl of reaction buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The phosphatase catalyzes the metabolism of OMFP to the fluorescent product O-methylfluorescein (OMF). Fluorescent emissions from the hydrolysis of OMFP to OMF were measured at room temperature using a Photon Technology Inc. Quantum Master Fluorometer (29Harris B.Z. Lau F.W. Fujii N. Guy R.K. Lim W.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2797-2805Google Scholar) with an excitation filter of 485 nm and emissions filter of 530 nm. Data were fit to the appropriate equation using nonlinear least-squares analysis in ProFit 5.1.0 (Quantum Soft). Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates (20 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and probed with anti-p-p38, anti-cyclin E, anti-cyclin A, anti-cyclin D1, anti-CDK4, anti-CDK6, anti-CDK2, anti-CDC25A, anti-p57, anti-p27, anti-p21, anti-p16, or anti-WEE1. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody was employed to detect immunoreactive bands using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). In selected cases immunoprecipitation was carried out prior to Western blot analysis. Cellular lysates (200 μg) were incubated with anti-CDK2 or anti-CDC2 antibody and protein G-Sepharose for 1–2hat 4 C. Immunoprecipitates were collected and then boiled for 5 min. Denatured CDC2 and CDK2 protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot was carried out as described above with anti-CDC2-phospho Tyr15 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). This antibody reacts with phospho-Tyr15 in both CDK2 and CDC2 (30Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls test to assess significance. ET has been reported to stimulate cell proliferation in a number of in vitro models, including vascular smooth muscle cells (15Berk B.C. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 999-1030Google Scholar), albeit not under all conditions (16Jahan H. Kobayashi S. Nishimura J. Kanaide H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 295: 261-269Google Scholar, 31Yang Z. Krasnici N. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1999; 100: 5-8Google Scholar, 32Scott-Burden T. Resink T.J. Hahn A.W. Vanhoutte P.M. J Cardiovasc Pharmacol. 1991; 17: S96-S100Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, [3H]thymidine incorporation in our neonatal RASM cells increased 5-fold in response to treatment with ET (10-7m) for 24 h. Note that basal incorporation of [3H]thymidine was readily detectable in the untreated cultures (see Fig. 1 legend). The increment in DNA synthesis was accompanied by true mitogenic activity with roughly a 2-fold increment in cell number seen following 24 h of treatment with the peptide (Fig. 1B). ET has been shown to activate a number of different pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells (33Demoliou-Mason C.D. Biol. Signals Recept. 1998; 7: 90-97Google Scholar, 34Neylon C.B. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1999; 26: 149-153Google Scholar). Among these the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) has been most closely associated with the pro-mitogenic activity of the peptide (17Chen S. Gardner D.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 653-662Google Scholar, 18Morey A.K. Pedram A. Razandi M. Prins B.A. Hu R.M. Biesiada E. Levin E.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3330-3339Google Scholar, 19Whelchel A. Evans J. Posada J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 589-596Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, ET elicited approximately a 6-fold increment in ERK activity in the RASM cells which was readily suppressed by co-incubation with the MEK (ERK kinase) inhibitors PD98059 and U0126. The stimulation of ERK was accompanied by a 6-fold increment in p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) activity, a downstream target of ERK (Fig. 2B) and, in similar fashion, the increase in RSK activity was abolished following co-incubation with the MEK inhibitors (Fig. 2C). A 4-fold ET-dependent increment in [3H]thymidine incorporation was similarly reduced, albeit incompletely (∼60–70% inhibition), with the MEK inhibitors (Fig. 2D). This was accompanied by a similar partial reversal in the ET-dependent increment in cell number (Fig. 2E). ET also effected a stimulation of CDK2 activity, measured either directly in immune complex kinase assays or indirectly as cyclin E- or cyclin A-associated kinase activity (Fig. 2F). This increase was nearly completely abrogated by the MEK inhibitors implying a mechanistic link between ET stimulation of ERK and the subsequent activation of CDK2 and accompanying mitogenic activity. Neither CDK4, CDK6 (each of which interacts with cyclins D1–4 at an earlier point in the cell cycle) nor CDK7 (the CDK-activating kinase or CAK) activity were affected by ET treatment (data not shown). The neonatal RASM used here have the advantage that they can be passaged in culture for an extended period of time; however, it is formally possible that their growth characteristics may not adequately mirror those found in adult cells. To exclude the possibility that the observed effects represent an artifact intrinsic to the neonatal system, we carried out parallel studies using RASM cells cultured from adult rat aorta. As shown in Fig. 3A, ET treatment led to a similar, albeit less robust (3.5 versus 5-fold) increment in [3H]thymidine incorporation which was blocked (∼50%) by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 3A). ET treatment also led to a time-dependent increment in ERK and CDK2 activity (Fig. 3, B and C) and, in both cases, these inductions were blocked by PD98059 (Fig. 3, D and E). These findings indicate that the ET-dependent activation of CDK2 operates through a MEK-dependent signaling event in both neonatal and adult RASM cells. The qualitative features of individual inductions are similar in the two cell types. To explore more closely the mechanism responsible for the increase in CDK2 activity, we measured levels of several key cell cycle regulators using conventional Western blot analysis. Levels of CDK2, cyclin E and cyclin A, the G1 cyclins typically associated with increased CDK2 activity, were readily detectable in the neonatal RASM cultures (these cells divide at a modest rate under basal conditions, see Fig. 1) but were unaffected by ET treatment (data not shown). Levels of cyclin D1 and its cognate cyclin dependent kinases, CDK4 and CDK6, were also unchanged following ET treatment, as were the CDK inhibitory proteins p57, p27, and p16INK while p21 was modestly increased (data not shown). In the absence of increases in CDK2-associated cyclins (cyclins A and E), increases in levels of CDK2 itself, increases in activity or levels of the CDK activating kinase (CAK or CDK7) and no evidence for reductions in levels of the CDK2 inhibitors p21, p27, or p57 (p21 levels, in fact, increased as noted above), we were left to explore other mechanisms to account for the ET-dependent stimulation of CDK2 activity. Activity of CDK2 and that of its G2 counterpart CDC2 are regulated by two opposing kinase activities. CAK/CDK7 phosphorylates Thr160 in CDK2 (Thr161 in CDC2) promoting activation of the kinase while phosphorylation of Tyr15 in CDK2 by a unique kinase termed WEE1 leads to suppression of CDK2 activity (2Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Google Scholar, 3Wu C.L. Kirley S.D. Xiao H. Chuang Y. Chung D.C. Zukerberg L.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7325-7332Google Scholar, 4McGowan C.H. Russell P.

For CDC2 this latter inhibitory function is subserved by a combination of WEE1, which phosphorylates CDC2 at Tyr15 and a second kinase called MYT1, which phosphorylates CDC2 at Thr14 and Tyr15 and blocks its activity (11Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Google Scholar, 35Booher R.N. Holman P.S. Fattaey A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22300-22306Google Scholar). Control of WEE1 or MYT1 activity occurs through phosphorylation (N-terminal domain of Wee1 and C-terminal domain of Myt1) with subsequent reduction in their respective inhibitory kinase activities (2Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Google Scholar,4McGowan C.H. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2166-2175Google Scholar, 5Honda R. Tanaka H. Ohba Y. Yasuda H.

We examined the ability of ET to promote phosphorylation of WEE1 in the neonatal RASM cell cultures. As shown in Fig. 4A, extracts from ET-treated RASM cells effected a 4–5-fold increment in GST-WEE1 phosphorylation compared with control cells. This occurred within 20 min following administration of the peptide and slowly decayed back toward baseline over the next 3 h. Endogenous WEE1 protein levels in the extracts, assessed using conventional Western blot analysis, were unchanged over the same time interval. Importantly, the ET-dependent increment in WEE1 phosphorylation was completely reversed by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 4B) suggesting that the observed increment in CDK2 activity is mediated by a MEK/ERK-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of WEE1. This latter point was explored more fully through direct measurement of WEE1 activity in extracts of ET-treated versus untreated RASM cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, IPs of WEE1 collected from extracts of untreated cells phosphorylated a modified CDK2 substrate (mutated at Thr160). ET decreased the level of WEE1-dependent CDK2 phosphorylation by 70%. This effect also was completely reversed by the MEK inhibitor PD98056. Futhermore, treatment with ET led to a reduction in the level of phosphorylation of CDK2 at Tyr15 (the target of WEE1) (Fig. 5B) and, once again, this was reversed by PD98059. Extrapolating these analyses to adult RASM cells demonstrated a similar ET-dependent phosphorylation of Wee1 (Fig. 6A) and coincident reduction in Wee1 activity (Fig. 6B). In each instance the ET effect was reversed by co-incubation with the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 6, A and B). Additional support for this model was obtained through transfection of wild-type ERK or dominant negative MEK expression vectors into adult RASM cells. Overexpression of ERK led to the expected increase in ERK activity, assessed using GST-WEE1 as a substrate (Fig. 6C). This was only modestly increased by treatment with ET. Transfection of dominant negative MEK [MEK (-)] had little effect on basal activity but reduced the ET-dependent increment in ERK activity by more than 50%. Of note the ERK transfectants demonstrated a significant reduction in WEE1 activity, using GST-mCDK2 as a substrate, which was equivalent to but not additive with that effected by ET (Fig. 6D). Cotransfection of dominant negative MEK led to partial reversal of the ET-dependent inhibition. Collectively, these data make a compelling argument that ET stimulates CDK2 activity and promotes cell cycle progression in RASM cells at different developmental stages, at least in part, through an ERK/MEK-dependent suppression of the inhibitory kinase Wee1.Fig. 5ET inactivates WEE1. Panel A, quiescent cells were preincubated with PD98059 for 1 h and then incubated with ET for an additional 1 h. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-WEE1 antibody. Immune complex assays of WEE1 activity were performed using [γ-32P]ATP and purified PA-cyclin A-GST-mCDK2 as substrate. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, GST-mCDK2 phosphorylation was detected by conventional autoradiography. Panel B, cells were pretreated with PD98059 for 1 h and then incubated with ET for 16 h. Immunoprecipitates of CDK2 were generated from control versus ET-treated lysates with or without preincubation with PD98059.

Previous studies of mouse thymoma cells showed that GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but enriched in a mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) domain. Because PIG-L has no readily identifiable ER sorting determinants, we were interested in learning how PIG-L is localized to the ER and possibly enriched in MAM. We used HeLa cells transiently or stably expressing epitope-tagged PIG-L variants or chimeric constructs composed of elements of PIG-L fused to Tac antigen, a cell surface protein. We first analyzed the subcellular distribution of PIG-L and Glc-NAc-PI-de-N-acetylase activity and then studied the localization of Tac-PIG-L chimeras to identify sequence elements in PIG-L responsible for its subcellular localization. We show that human PIG-L is a type I membrane protein with a large cytoplasmic domain and that, unlike the result with mouse thymoma cells, both PIG-L and GlcNAc-PI-de-N-acetylase activity are uniformly distributed between ER and MAM in HeLa cells. Analyses of a series of Tac-PIG-L chimeras indicated that PIG-L contains two ER localization signals, an independent retention signal located between residues 60 and 88 of its cytoplasmic domain and another weak signal in the luminal and transmembrane domains that functions autonomously in the presence of membrane proximal residues of the cytoplasmic domain that themselves lack any retention information. We conclude that PIG-L, like a number of other ER membrane proteins, is retained in the ER through a multi-component localization signal rather than a discrete sorting motif.

GlcNAc-PI is then de-N-acetylated and mannosylated. In mammalian cells and yeast, GlcN-PI must first be acylated on the inositol residue before mannose addition can occur. Mannosylated GPIs are substrates for phosphoethanolamine transferases that can add up to three phosphoethanolamine residues to the core glycan. GPIs containing a phosphoethanolamine cap may be enzymatically transferred to ER-translocated proteins with a C-terminal GPI signal sequence, thus generating a GPI-anchored protein destined for the cell surface (for review, see Refs. 1Kinoshita T.

BioEssays. 2003; 25: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The GPI biosynthetic pathway is structurally, topologically, and spatially complex. It requires the participation of ∼20 different gene products, some of which are organized as multi-subunit complexes (1Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Curr. Opin. Chem.

BioEssays. 2003; 25: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Early biosynthetic steps occur on the cytoplasmic face of the ER, whereas later steps are located at the lumenal face (5Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J.

This indicates that a GPI biosynthetic intermediate, likely GlcN-PI or GlcN-acyl PI, must flip across the ER membrane to be elaborated into a mature GPI structure (2McConville M.J. Menon A.K. Mol.

Working with a mouse thymoma cell line (BW5147.3) we recently discovered that although the capacity to synthesize GlcNAc-PI appears to be uniformly distributed in the ER, the next five steps of GPI biosynthesis leading to the synthesis of the singly mannosylated GPI intermediate H5 (phosphoethanolamine-2Manα1–4GlcN-acyl-PI) is enriched in a domain of the ER that is associated with mitochondria (8Vidugiriene J.

These mitochondria-associated ER membranes, or MAMs, correspond to a rapidly sedimenting ER fraction that is biochemically distinct from traditionally isolated endoplasmic reticula (9Vance J.E. J.

Evidence for compartmentation of GPI biosynthetic enzymes within the ER was also reported in a different mouse thymoma cell line (EL4) using a gradient centrifugation approach to separate ER-derived membrane fractions (12Stevens V.L. Zhang H. Kristyanne E.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 577-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first of the MAM-enriched steps in the thymoma GPI biosynthetic pathway is the de-N-acetylation reaction that converts GlcNAc-PI to GlcN-PI (8Vidugiriene J. Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Baumann N.A.

Human PIG-L is a 252-amino acid membrane protein with a large cytoplasmic domain. Although PIG-L shows little homology to other known proteins, it contains a HXXEH zinc binding motif characteristic of many de-N-acetylases, and it specifically restores cell surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins in a GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase-defective Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant cell line (15Stevens V.L. Zhang H. Harreman M. J. Biochem. 1996; 313: 253-258Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, rat PIG-L protein, when expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli, possesses metal ion-dependent GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity (14Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Maeda Y. Nakamura N. Kinoshita T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Studies using substrate analogues show that human and Trypanosoma brucei PIG-L differ significantly in their substrate specificities, indicating that PIG-L may be an attractive target for the development of anti-parasite drugs (16Smith T.K.

We are interested in learning how PIG-L is localized to the ER and whether it contains signals or structural motifs that contribute to its presumed enrichment in the MAM. PIG-L, like other enzymes in the mammalian GPI biosynthetic pathway, has no readily identifiable sorting determinants such as the di-lysine or di-arginine motifs that have been shown to act as retrieval signals for certain ER membrane proteins (19Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which PIG-L is localized to the ER is unclear. To address this issue, we analyzed PIG-L localization and targeting in HeLa cells, a cell type that has been used to assay inhibitors of PIG-L activity in vitro (16Smith T.K. Sharma D.K. Crossman A.

We first carried out experiments to establish the subcellular distribution of PIG-L and GlcNAc-PI-de-N-acetylase activity in these cells using immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation and then analyzed the subcellular distribution of various chimeric constructs to identify sequence elements in PIG-L responsible for its subcellular localization. Our results show that although it is possible to generate a characteristic MAM fraction from HeLa cells, neither epitope-tagged PIG-L protein (transiently or stably expressed) nor Glc-NAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity is enriched in this fraction. Instead, both PIG-L and GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity are uniformly concentrated in the ER and MAM. Thus, the sub-ER compartmentation of GPI synthesis observed previously in analyses of mouse thymoma cells (8Vidugiriene J. Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Baumann N.A. Menon A.K. J. Biol.

We discuss this result in the context of precedents for cell type-specific differences in the fine subcellular distribution of a number of enzymes. To identify sequence elements in PIG-L responsible for its ER localization, we first established that PIG-L is a type I membrane protein and then analyzed the subcellular distribution of chimeric proteins consisting of PIG-L fragments fused to Tac antigen, a cell surface-expressed, N- and O-glycosylated type I membrane protein (23Leonard W.J.

Our results show that the ER sorting information in human PIG-L is located in the cytoplasmic tail of the protein, with the sequence between residues 60 and 88 especially important. We also show that the PIG-L transmembrane span, although unable to act as an independent localization signal, can act in concert with severely truncated, non-functional cytoplasmic tail sequences to localize the corresponding chimeric constructs to the ER. We conclude that PIG-L, like a number of other ER membrane proteins, is retained in the ER through a multi-component localization signal rather than a discrete sorting motif. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F-12 medium, fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Goat serum and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes, DNA modifying enzymes, and DNA polymerase were purchased from MBI Fermentas (Amherst, NY) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Protease inhibitor mixture and DNase I were purchased from Calbiochem and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (60 Ci/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Glass-backed silica 60 thin layer plates were from Merck. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against FLAG and V5 epitope tags, green fluorescent protein (GFP), and human calnexin were purchased from Sigma, Invitrogen, MBL (Nagoya, Japan) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-Tac antibodies 3G10 and anti-human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) antibodies (clone 8B6) were purchased from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) and DAKO (Carpinteria, CA), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal anti-V5 and anti-ribophorin I antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Karen Colley (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL) and Dr. Christopher Nicchitta (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Gpi8 antibodies were generated by Dr. Saulius Vainauskas in our laboratory using an E. coli-expressed polypeptide corresponding to residues 31–322 of human Gpi8. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa Fluor 488 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Plasmid Construction—Human PIG-L cDNA was obtained by PCR using a HeLa cell cDNA library as template (Invitrogen). To generate cDNA encoding N-terminal FLAG-tagged human PIG-L, a sense primer-containing sequence encoding a FLAG epitope tag (TGGAATTCCATCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGAAGCAATGTGGCTCCTGTGT) was used in the PCR reaction in conjunction with an antisense primer (GAGGAAGCTTAGTGAGTTGATTCTCATGTAC). To generate cDNAs encoding FLAG-PIG-L-V5 and FLAG-PIG-L-GFP, the PCR fragment was cloned into a pEF6/V5 His vector (Invitrogen) using the TOPO cloning kit from Invitrogen or cloned into a pEGFPN1 vector (Clontech) using EcoRI and BamHI sites, respectively. An N-glycosylation site (ANSTS) was appended to the N terminus of FLAG-PIG-L-GFP using specific primers to obtain ANSTS-FLAG-PIG-L-GFP. Human Tac cDNA, a gift from Dr. Thomas Waldmann (NIH), was subcloned into pEF6/V5 His vector using BamHI and XbaI sites. Plasmids encoding chimeras of Tac and PIG-L were generated using PCR by the overlap extension method (25Horton R. Hunt H. Ho S. Pullen J. Pease L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar) and cloned into a pEF6/V5 His vector using BamHI and XbaI. Plasmid preparation and transformation were carried out according to standard protocols, and all constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and cDNA Transfection—HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The CHO-K1 cell lines G9PLAP (stably expressing human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and its derivative G9PLAP 0.85 (a mutant lacking PIG-L protein (15Stevens V.L. Zhang H. Harreman M. J. Biochem. 1996; 313: 253-258Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) were kindly provided by Dr. Victoria Stevens (Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA). CHO K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. For transfections, exponentially growing cells were trypsinized and washed once with cytomix buffer (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2). The cells were resuspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml in the same buffer, and 400 μlof suspension was transferred to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Invitrogen). 35 μg of DNA was added to the cell suspension in the cuvette and mixed well. The mixture was then exposed to a single electric pulse of 300 V with a capacitance of 1000 microfarads using an Invitrogen pulse system. The cells were allowed to recover in culture medium at 37 °C (5% CO2 atmosphere) for 48 h before harvesting for biochemical analyses or immunofluorescence microscopy. HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-PIG-L-GFP were selected by growing cells in 600 μg/ml G418 for 4 weeks and by subsequently maintaining the cultures in 250 μg/ml G418. Flow Cytometric Analyses—G9PLAP 0.85 cells were transfected with 35 μg of vector DNA or epitope-tagged PIG-L constructs as described above. After ∼48 h the cells were harvested and washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA). The cells were stained with monoclonal anti-human PLAP (10 μg/ml) followed by 2 μg/ml phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Caltag Laboratories). Surface expression of PLAP was detected using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACScan, BD Biosciences). Similar analyses were carried out with untransfected G9PLAP 0.85 or wild-type G9PLAP cells. Fluorescence Microscopy—Transiently transfected HeLa cells were grown on coverslips for ∼48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were either treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for 2.5 h at 37 °C and then fixed or directly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at ambient temperature. After three washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were either treated with digitonin (3 μg/ml in cytomix buffer with 0.3 m sucrose) for 30 min at 4 °C to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane or with Triton X-100 (0.3% in PBS) for 25 min on ice to permeabilize all cellular membranes. For non-permeabilized samples, cells were left in cold PBS at 4 °C for 25 min. Permeabilized or non-permeabilized cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with 10% goat serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. This was followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody at 1 μg/ml, rabbit anti-V5 antibody at a 1:500 dilution, or anti-Tac monoclonal antibody at a 1:500 dilution. The cells were then washed with PBS three times and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with a drop of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and taken for confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope (type MRC 1000). Immunoprecipitation—Transfected HeLa cells (1–2 × 107) were scraped 2 days post-transfection, washed once with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of MSB buffer (40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and solubilized on ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The S10 supernatant thus obtained was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. To the supernatant fraction 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) slurry was added, and the sample was incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle agitation. The agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation (15 s, 10,000 × g) and washed 4 times with 1 ml of MSB buffer. Bound antigen was released by incubating the beads with FLAG peptide (250 μg/ml) in MSB buffer. For immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 or anti-Tac antibodies, the S10 supernatant was pre-cleared by incubating it with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose resin slurry (Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h. After a brief centrifugation (15 s, 10,000 × g) the supernatant was incubated with 1.5 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-V5 for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (20 μl of slurry) was then added, and the sample was incubated on a rotator at 4 °C overnight. The beads were pelleted, then washed 4 times with 1 ml of MSB buffer. Protein bound to the protein G-slurry was eluted by boiling in 1× denaturing buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 100 °C. Glycosidase Treatment and Immunoblotting—cDNA corresponding to ANSTS-FLAG-PIG-L-GFP was electroporated into HeLa cells, and a lysate was prepared by resuspending cells in MSB buffer. The sample was denatured by adding 0.1 volume of 10× endoglycosidase H (Endo H) denaturation buffer (5% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiling for 5 min. Then 0.1 volume of 10× Endo H reaction buffer (0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5) was added to the denatured sample followed by incubation with 250 units of Endo H for 2 h at 37 °C. Anti-V5 immunoprecipitates of Tac chimeras expressed in HeLa cells were similarly treated with Endo H. For peptide N-glycosidase F treatment of immunoprecipitated Tac chimeras, samples were eluted from antibody beads by boiling with 1× denaturation buffer, cooled to room temperature, and incubated with 0.1 volume of 10× peptide N-glycosidase F reaction buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) containing 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. Samples were digested with 500 units of peptide N-glycosidase F for 2 h at 37 °C. After digestion, treated and untreated samples were boiled with SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol for 5 min. Treated and control samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with mouse anti-GFP or rabbit anti-V5 antibodies. Immunoblots were visualized using ECL reagents from Pierce and quantitated using Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Fractionation and GPI Assays—HeLa cells were grown on 12 × 150-mm plates to confluency. Cells from each plate (∼1 × 107) were electroporated with 35 μg of DNA in a 0.4-cm cuvette and then re-plated to allow the cells to recover. Two days post-transfection cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in Buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) at a density of ∼1 × 107 cells/ml and lysed by nitrogen bomb cavitation at 400 p.s.i. for 30 min on ice. Subcellular fractionation of lysed cells was carried out as previously described (8Vidugiriene J. Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Baumann N.A. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15203-15212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Protein content of SDS-solubilized fractions was measured using the Micro-BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Samples for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were prepared by heating samples with SDS sample buffer for 1 h at 60 °C. Blot signals from different protein loadings and film exposure were quantitated using Image Quant software. Fractions were characterized by measuring organelle-specific markers NADPH-cytochrome reductase c (ER marker) and succinate-cytochrome reductase c (inner membrane mitochondria marker). NADPH-cytochrome c reductase (ER marker) activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm for 5 min. Different subcellular fractions were incubated in 1 ml of assay mixture containing 0.05 m phosphate buffer, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.7, 36 μm cytochrome c at room temperature for 5 min with 2 μg/ml rotenone to inhibit the mitochondrion-specific NADH dehydrogenase. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μlof1mm NADPH. Succinatecytochrome c reductase, a mitochondrial inner membrane marker, was assayed as follows. Subcellular fractions were incubated with 1 ml of assay buffer containing 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm KCN, 20 mm succinate, and 2 μg/ml rotenone. The reaction was initiated by adding 39 μlof1mm cytochrome c, and the increase in absorbance was monitored for 5 min. GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity was assayed by incubating subcellular fractions (10 μg) with [3H]GlcNAc-PI (∼2000 cpm) that had been previously solubilized in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Reactions were stopped by placing the tubes on ice, and a single phase lipid extract was obtained by adding 160 μl of water, 40 μl of 1 n HCl, and 1.5 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol (v/v). A 2-phase mixture was induced by adding 0.5 ml of chloroform and 0.5 ml of water. The lipid-containing chloroform-rich lower phase was washed several times with 1.0 ml of mock upper phase, dried, and dissolved in water-saturated n-butyl alcohol. The radiolabeled lipids in the butanol extract were resolved by thin layer chromatography (silica gel 60; chloroform, methanol, 1 m ammonium hydroxide 10:10:3 (v/v/v)) and detected with a thin layer chromatography (TLC) radioscanner (Berthold Analytical Instruments, Inc. Nashua, NH). Incorporation of radioactivity into individual species ([3H]GlcNAc-PI and [3H]GlcN-PI) was determined using the integration software provided with the scanner. GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity was also measured indirectly by incubating isolated fractions (100 μg of protein) with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (1 μCi) in buffer A in the presence of 5 mm EDTA and 1 μg/ml PI dissolved in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (total reaction volume, 200 μl). After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C samples were subjected to lipid extraction and analysis as described above. Epitope-tagged PIG-L Constructs Are Functional—We generated several tagged versions of human PIG-L protein for use in the studies described in this paper. We determined that the tagged proteins were functional by testing their ab"
https://openalex.org/W2157170699,"In this study, the contribution of intramembrane hydrogen bonding at the interface between polypeptide and cofactor is explored in the native lipid environment by use of model bacteriochlorophyll proteins. In the peripheral antenna complex, LH2, large portions of the transmembrane helices, which make up the dimeric bacteriochlorophyll-binding site, are replaced by simplified, alternating alanine-leucine stretches. Replacement of either one of the two helices with the helices containing the model sequence at a time results in the assembly of complexes with nearly native light harvesting properties. In contrast, replacement of both helices results in the loss of antenna complexes from the membrane. The assembly of such doubly modified complexes is restored by a single intramembrane serine residue at position -4 relative to the liganding histidine of the α-subunit. In situ analysis of the spectral properties in a series of site-directed mutants reveals a critical dependence of the model complex assembly on the side chain of the residue at this position in the helix. A hydrogen bond between the hydroxy group of the serine and the 131 keto group of one of the central bacteriochlorophylls of the complexes is identified by Raman spectroscopy in the model antenna complex containing one of the alanine-leucine helices. The additional OH group of the serine residue, which participates in hydrogen bonding, increases the thermal stability of the model complexes in the native membrane. Intramembrane hydrogen bonding is thus shown to be a key factor for the binding of bacteriochlorophyll and assembly of this model cofactor-polypeptide site.

(Bacterio)chlorophyll ((B)Chl) 1The abbreviations used are: (B)Chl, (bacterio)chlorophyll; LH, light harvesting complex; TMH, transmembrane helix; TM, transmembrane; FT, Fourier transform; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: (B)Chl, (bacterio)chlorophyll; LH, light harvesting complex; TMH, transmembrane helix; TM, transmembrane; FT, Fourier transform; wt, wild type. proteins are at the center of energy conversion of almost all photosynthetic organisms. The (B)Chl cofactors are mostly bound to the transmembrane (TM) domains of pigment protein complexes embedded in the photosynthetic membranes (1McDermott G. Prince S.M. Freer A.A. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A.M. Papiz M.Z. Cogdell R.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 517-521Crossref Scopus (2486) Google Scholar, 2Fromme P. Jordan P. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 5-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Multiple types of interactions exist between the (B)Chl and the surrounding polypeptide(s). The best understood interaction between the polypeptides and (B)Chl is the ligation of the central magnesium ion by a suitable residue, frequently a histidine (2Fromme P. Jordan P. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 5-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Multiple additional types of interactions between the (B)Chl and the surrounding polypeptide(s) are obvious from the complex structures of the (B)Chl with up to four peripheral C=O groups, several asymmetric centers, and the long chain esterifying alcohol. The involvement of carbonyl groups in intermolecular hydrogen bonds has been explored in detail for the acetyl and keto groups of BChl in photosynthetic complexes from purple photosynthetic bacteria. In the case of the acetyl group, hydrogen bonding to neighboring residues modulate the functional properties, specifically the excitation energies of BChl a in light harvesting (LH) complexes from purple bacteria (3Fowler G.J. Sockalingum G.D. Robert B. Hunter C.N. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Sturgis J.N. Robert B. J. Phys. Chem. 1997; 101: 7227-7231Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that hydrogen bonding to the acetyl group contributes to the tuning of the redox energies of P870 in bacterial reaction centers (5Ivancich A. Artz K. Williams J.C. Allen J.P. Mattioli T.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11812-11820Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but this is still under some dispute (6Spiedel D. Jones M.R. Robert B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding to the C131 keto carbonyl at the isocyclic ring, which is common to all chlorophylls, seems to be widespread (6Spiedel D. Jones M.R. Robert B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 7Witt H. Schlodder E. Teutloff C. Niklas J. Bordignon E. Carbonera D. Kohler S. Labahn A. Lubitz W.

In the crystal structure of photosystem I reaction center (2Fromme P. Jordan P. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 5-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), which comprises more than 10 TM subunits and contains nearly 100 Chl-binding pockets, the majority of the polar groups of Chls, in particular the C131 keto group, are likely to be hydrogen-bonded by the polypeptide residues in close vicinity (9Braun P. Vegh A. Strohmann B. Hunter N. Robert B. Scheer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1607: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Moenne-Loccoz P. Robert B. Ikegami I. Lutz M.

It is not exactly understood, however, whether these hydrogen bonds essentially contribute to the structural stability of the membrane-embedded (B)Chl proteins. In recent years, major advances have been made in the understanding of the factors that determine membrane protein folding and assembly (for a recent review, see the work of DeGrado et al. (13DeGrado W.F. Gratkowski T.T. Lear J.P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 647-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)). Hydrogen bonding interactions have been proposed to significantly contribute to the stability of helix-helix associations devoid of cofactors. Formation of hydrogen bonds is energetically far more favorable in the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer than in a hydrophilic milieu, because of the low effective dielectric environment of the lipids. This has been demonstrated experimentally by comparison of the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonding of model compounds in Me2SO and water (14Shan S.O. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14474-14479Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Intermolecular hydrogen bonding may drive the assembly of transmembrane helices (TMH) in detergent and biological membranes (15Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 16Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct.

A. 2001; 98: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In addition, in numerous high resolution structures of membrane proteins, hydrogen bonding networks are likely to exist at helix-helix interfaces between membrane-embedded backbone keto groups and polar side chains as well as between side chain groups (19Adamian L. Jackups Jr., R. Binkowski T.A. Liang J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 251-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Adamian L. Liang J.

A. 2001; 98: 9056-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Particular hydrogen bonding motifs have been identified in which residues with short side chains, especially serine, are frequently found, but also histidine and tyrosine are often present in these motifs (20Adamian L. Liang J. Proteins. 2002; 47: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Dawson J.P. Weinger J.S. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In photosynthetic proteins, the detailed understanding of interactions between the membrane-embedded (B)Chl and the TM helix are not as far advanced. In many cases, the BChl-helix interactions exceed the helix-helix interactions and often play a key role in correct folding and assembly of pigment protein complexes (23Kim J. Eichacker L.A. Rudiger W. Mullet J.E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Plumley G.F. Schmidt G.W.

Our strategy to study the binding of BChl to membrane-embedded helices and the assembly to stable TMH/BChl pockets is based on the use of model BChl proteins, modified in particular near the BChl-binding sites. In previous works, ligation of the central magnesium atom of coherent Argon laser (Innova 100), to histidines of synthetic de novo peptides has been achieved by a chemical modeling approach (28Snigula H. Monien B. Drepper F. de Jonge N. Haehnel W. Scheer H. PS2001 Proceedings: 12th International Congress on Photosynthesis. CSIRO Publishing, Melbourne, Australia2001Google Scholar, 29Rau H.K. Snigula H. Struck A. Robert B. Scheer H. Haehnel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3284-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This approach, however, depends on the reconstitution with pigments in a non-native system and relies on aqueous systems, either by use of detergents or by rendering the helices water-soluble. Here, we use a complementary approach to synthetic systems that is based on the “quasi-homologous” expression of model BChl proteins in a modified Rhodobacter sphaeroides strain (30Jones M.R.

The main objective of this study has been the exploration of the role of intramembrane hydrogen bonding in BChl binding and assembly of light harvesting systems in their native membrane environment. The residues of the BChl-B850-binding 2The number following BChl indicates the maximum absorption of the red-most absorption band of BChl. 2The number following BChl indicates the maximum absorption of the red-most absorption band of BChl. site of the peripheral antenna complex, LH2, from R. sphaeroides, have been successively replaced by simplified alternating Ala-Leu stretches up to the point where LH2 assembly was abolished. Restoration of the assembly of the light harvesting active BChl-B850 site has been achieved by the insertion of a single serine residue in the Ala-Leu stretch close to the BChl. The BChl organization and energy transfer functions of the resulting complexes have been evaluated. The hydrogen bonding states of the BChl-B850 keto carbonyls have been examined in the presence and absence of serine in mutants with suitable expression levels allowing for FT Raman resonance spectroscopy. As a result of this study, the contribution of hydrogen bonding to the stable assembly of light harvesting complex with model BChl-binding sites has been elucidated within the native lipid environment.

The mobilizable plasmids used were based on pRKCBC1 (TcR, derivative of pRK415; insertion of a 4.4-kb fragment encompassing pucBAC); briefly, this expression vector contains the pucBA genes as a 420-base pair KpnI-BamHI insert (30Jones M.R.

For R. sphaeroides, the antibiotics were tetracycline (1 μg/ml) and neomycin (10 or 20 μg/ml). Conjugative transfer of plasmid from E. coli S17-1 to R. sphaeroides was performed as described (31Fowler G.J. Gardiner A.T. Mackenzie R.C. Barratt S.J. Simmons A.E. Westerhuis W.H. Cogdell R.J.

Construction of Mutant LH2—The construction of αAL has been carried as described previously (32Braun P. Olsen J. Strohmann B. Hunter C.N. Scheer H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For the construction of βAL, pucB was subcloned into pGem4+ (Invitrogen) using an engineered HindIII site between pucB and pucA, just downstream of the stop codon of pucB, and a KpnI site upstream of the pucB coding region. Two additional sites, MluI and NcoI, were introduced into the pucB coding region by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Novel pucB was constructed by replacing the MluI-NcoI fragment by a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding a stretch of 18 residues, yielding the LH2-β TMH with the novel sequence LLIALLAHLLAA (see Fig. 1). For the construction of αALS-4 and αAL with Cys, His, Asn, Gln, Asp, Glu, Lys, Phe, and Tyr at position -4 instead of Ala, the pucA gene with model helix AL was further modified by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange), and pucA was subcloned into Topo-TA (Invitrogen) using an engineered HindIII site between pucB and pucA, just downstream of the stop codon of pucB, and a BamHI site downstream of the pucA coding region. Instrumentation—UV-visible absorbance spectra were recorded on a Lamda 25 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or Shimadzu UV-2401PC, CD spectra on a Dichrograph CD6 (Jobin Yvon). FT Raman spectra were recorded using a Bruker IFS 66 interferometer coupled to a Bruker FRA 106 Raman module equipped with a continuous coherent Argon laser (Innova 100), as described previously (3Fowler G.J.

Preparation of Intracytoplasmic Membranes—The membranes were prepared from cells grown semi-aerobically in the dark by disruption in a French pressure cell and subsequent centrifugation on a sucrose step gradient (32Braun P. Olsen J. Strohmann B. Hunter C.N. Scheer H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thermal Denaturation of LH2—Thermal denaturation of membranes containing LH2 from R. sphaeroides DD13 was carried out as described (9Braun P. Vegh A. Strohmann B. Hunter N. Robert B. Scheer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1607: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In essence, purified membranes, wt LH2 and LH2 αS(-4)A were adjusted to an A850 nm = ∼3 cm-1 in Tris (10 mm, pH 8) EDTA (1 mm) and measured in a 1-mm cylindrical quartz cuvette. The samples were heated from 4 or 15 to 95 °C at a constant rate of 1 °C min-1, and the CD signal at 845 nm was recorded every 0.05 °C (integration time, 0.2 s). Variations in sample turbidity (can be mimicked by the addition of milk to LH2 membrane samples) do not significantly affect the NIR-CD spectrum. The spectra were fitted or smoothed using the graphing and data analysis software Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Corporation). Design—This work is aimed at designing model BChl proteins (a) that are sufficiently destabilized not to assemble in vivo and (b) of which the assembly can be restored by site-directed “rescue mutations” (Fig. 1). Our strategy is to redesign the TMHs of the two apo-proteins that make up the LH2 subunits. In particular, large portions of the regions in close vicinity of the BChls are mutated to successively eliminate or perturb essential interaction at the BChl/polypeptide interface without altering domains that do not directly interact with pigments but appear to be critical for the overall assembly (1McDermott G. Prince S.M. Freer A.A. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A.M. Papiz M.Z. Cogdell R.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 517-521Crossref Scopus (2486) Google Scholar, 33Prince S.M. Papiz M.Z. Freer A.A.

The genes encoding the mosaic polypeptides, consisting of model sequences in the TMH, in particular, the BChl-B850-binding site region, and of native sequences adjacent to this site, are then expressed in situ. An engineered strain of purple bacterium, R. sphaeroides (30Jones M.R. Fowler G.J. Gibson L.C. Grief G.G. Olsen J.D. Crielaard W. Hunter C.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), serves as the expression system; it lacks the operons encoding the apoproteins of the photosynthetic apparatus but provides the assembly factors, pigments, and membranes that are required to test its fitness as a light harvesting unit within a nearly native system. For the construction of the model BChl-binding sites, native residues of the BChl-B850 TM domains have been replaced by simplified alternating Ala-Leu stretches as described previously (32Braun P. Olsen J. Strohmann B. Hunter C.N. Scheer H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The Ala-Leu stretch, αAL, which replaces the BChl-B850 site in LH2-α, extends over a stretch of 14 residues ranging from valine -7 3The numbering specifies the amino acid position relative to the histidine, designated His0, whichbinds the central magnesium of the α-BChl-B850. at its N terminus to threonine +6 at its C terminus (32Braun P. Olsen J. Strohmann B. Hunter C.N. Scheer H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In LH2-β, the Ala-Leu stretch, βAL, extends over 10 residues, ranging from glycine -7 to leucine +2 (Fig. 1A). These stretches make up most of the residues of the TMHs (except of βPhe-8 and βAla+3) that are in close contact (≤4.5Å) with the BChl-B850 molecules of both the α- and β-subunits (33Prince S.M. Papiz M.Z. Freer A.A. McDermott G. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A.M. Cogdell R.J. Isaacs N.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Neither His0, which binds the central magnesium of the BChl-B850, nor the adjacent Ile-1 of LH2-α were replaced, and Met-5 of LH2-β was changed to isoleucine instead of alanine. In the LH2-α of the R. sphaeroides wt sequence, residues at positions -5, +1, and +2 happened to be Ala already, and the residue at position +4 is a Leu. In total, eight “new” residues have thus been introduced in the 14-residue-long stretch enclosing all TMH residues of the BChl-B850 site (Fig. 1A). Similarly, in wt LH2-β, residues -4 and -1 are Ala already, and residues -3 and +2 are Leu, resulting in a total of five “new” residues in the 10-residue-long stretch. A third mosaic polypeptide, αALS-4 (Fig. 1A) has been constructed, identical to αAL, except for the residue at position -4, which is alanine in αAL and serine in αALS-4. To examine the assembly of antenna complexes in the presence of model sequences, the mosaic polypeptides were expressed in combination with either the complement wt polypeptide or with each other in the R. sphaeroides deletion strain DD13, which is devoid of BChl-binding proteins (LH1-, LH2-, and RC-) but capable of BChl synthesis (30Jones M.R. Fowler G.J. Gibson L.C. Grief G.G. Olsen J.D. Crielaard W. Hunter C.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this strain, expression of the novel LH2 complexes may be studied without the interference of endogenous, native BChl protein complexes, especially native LH2, and their electronic properties yield information on their ability to bind BChl molecules and assemble into native-like, angular structures. In Vivo Assembly of Model BChl Proteins—The assembly of the complexes is monitored by absorption spectroscopy, because significant spectral alterations accompany the BChl-BChl and BChl-polypeptide association to the native (αβ)9 or similar complexes. The near infrared absorption spectra of purified membranes of LH2-like complexes in which only one subunit has been replaced by the model TMH with the Ala-Leu stretch are similar to the spectra of wt LH2 complexes (Fig. 2, lower panel). The absorption spectra clearly indicate the presence of BChl complexes in membranes containing wt LH2 and the model TMHAL. The Qy transition maxima are red-shifted from 770 nm (free BChl, see below) to 800 nm in both wt and TMHAL, typical for the B800 pigments, and to 849 nm in wt and 848–53 nm in TMHAL, typical for the B850 pigments in LH2 complexes. If both the TMHs of the α- and β-subunits are replaced by TMHAL, the B800 and B850 bands of LH2-like antenna complexes are lost, nor are there any other near infrared absorption bands. The absorption spectra of whole cells containing LH2 with αAL-βAL are characterized by one main absorption band with the maximum at ≈765 nm (Fig. 2, upper panel), which is typical for “free” monomeric BChl, i.e. BChl that is not (tightly) bound to polypeptides and not assembled into pigment protein complexes. This indicates that simultaneous replacement of the TM domains, which make up the BChl-B850-binding site, results in the loss of the antenna complex from the membrane. Remarkably, assembly is restored in membranes containing LH2 with such doubly modified TMHs in which a serine residue replaces alanine at position -4 in model αALS-4 (Fig. 2, lower panel). In this rescued LH2 with αALS-4-βAL, the absorption bands of the B800 and B850 BChl are clearly observed at 800 and ∼850 nm, similar to wt LH2 as well as novel LH2 complexes with αAL-βwt, αALS-4-βwt, and αwt-βAL, in which only one subunit has been replaced at a time. These absorptions are typical for LH2; there are, however, a number of minor changes in the absorption spectrum of αALS-4-βAL. The red-most absorption band is slightly red-shifted from 849 to 853 nm in comparison with wt LH2 (Table I). A similar shift is also observed in LH2 with αALS-4-βwt as well as in LH2 with αAL-βwt. Therefore, this shift may indicate minor structural rearrangements of the BChl-B850 dimer because of the sequence changes in αAL. In addition, the B800/B850 absorption ratio is reduced (Fig. 2) either indicative of a partial loss of BChl-B800 and/or of structural reorganization of this site (34Bandilla M. Ucker B. Ram M. Simonin I.I. Gelhaye E. McDermott G. Cogdell R.J. Scheer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Gall A. Fowler G.J. Hunter C.N. Robert B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16282-16287Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In membranes containing αALS-4-βAL, the B800 transition is broadened to the blue side, and there is a shoulder at ∼770 nm indicative of elevated amounts of “free” BChl, which points to defects in the assembly and/or stability of the complexes (Figs. 2 and 3A) (32Braun P. Olsen J. Strohmann B. Hunter C.N. Scheer H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Quantitatively, less LH2 is assembled with αALS-4-βAL as compared with wt LH2 (and also to LH2 with αALS-4-βwt) as evaluated from the relative strength of the absorption bands in the nearly infrared and blue regions of the spectrum (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, the red shift to 850 nm is clearly retained, which indicates that the assembly of novel LH2 with the model BChl-B850 site is restored by a single serine residue, which replaces alanine at position -4 in the Ala-Leu stretch of αAL.Table ISpectral properties of LH2 wt and novel LH2 complexes Spectra are taken either from purified membranes or directly from R. sphaeroides DD13 whole cells as described in Fig. 5.LH2 complexQy transition maximumIn situPurified membranesnmLH2 wt849848LH2 αwt-βAL848848LH2 αAL-βwt853853LH2 αALS-4-βwt852852LH2 αALS-4-βwt853853LH2 αAL-βALNDaND, not determined765a ND, not determined Open table in a new tab The CD signal, in particular of the BChl-B850 transition, is largely retained in the LH2 with the model BChl-binding site, αALS-4-βAL. As shown in Fig. 3B, the conservative, S-shaped CD signal in the nearly infrared with extrema at ∼848 nm (+) and ∼872 nm (-) and zero crossing at ∼857 nm, is similar for wt LH2, LH2 with αALS-4-βwt and LH2 with αALS-4-βAL. In addition, the optical activity of BChl-B800, seen as a negative trough near 800 nm (34Bandilla M. Ucker B. Ram M. Simonin I.I. Gelhaye E. McDermott G. Cogdell R.J. Scheer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) is somewhat reduced in comparison with wt LH2. The signals of the carotenoids (450–550 nm) are slightly blue-shifted, possibly indicating a change in the mode of carotenoid binding in αALS-4-βwt and in αALS-4-βAL (Fig. 3B). Because BChl-BChl couplings are mainly accountable for the typical CD signal (36Koolhaus M.H. Frese R.N. Fowler G.J. Bibby T.S. Georgakopoulou S. van der Zwan G. Hunter C.N. van Grondelle R.

Apparently, the redesigned TMHs support not only binding of BChl but also association into structures with a geometry producing that of the BChl-B850 and BChl-B800 in native LH2. The replacement of alanine -4 by serine in the model helix, αAL, therefore restores the formation of the correct overall BChl-B850 geometry and arrangement in complexes that have their BChl-B850-binding site substantially mutated in both the α- and β-subunits.

T antigen is known to bind to p53, to the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of tumor suppressor proteins, and to other cellular proteins such as p300 family members. To test whether SV40 large T antigen inhibits cellular differentiation in vivo in the absence of cell cycle induction, we generated transgenic mice that express in the lens a mutant version of the early region of SV40. This mutant, which we term E107KΔ, has a deletion that eliminates synthesis of small t antigen and a point mutation (E107K) that results in loss of the ability to bind to Rb family members. At embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5), the transgenic lenses show dramatic defects in lens fiber cell differentiation. The fiber cells become post-mitotic, but do not elongate properly. The cells show a dramatic reduction in expression of their β- and γ-crystallins. Because CBP and p300 are co-activators for crystallin gene expression, we assayed for interactions between E107KΔ and CBP/p300. Our studies demonstrate that cellular differentiation can be inhibited by SV40 large T antigen in the absence of pRb inactivation, and that interaction of large T antigen with CBP/p300 may be enhanced by a mutation that eliminates the binding to pRb.

DNA tumor viruses such as simian virus 40 (SV40) and adenovirus inactivate pivotal checkpoints for cell cycle control, thereby stimulating host cell DNA synthesis and allowing viral DNA replication. The early region of SV40 encodes two proteins: the large T and small t antigens. Large T antigen is a potent 708-amino acid oncoprotein, which has transforming ability and can induce tumors in animal models (1Ali S.H. DeCaprio J.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Relevant targets of T antigen include the retinoblastoma family members, pRb, p107, and p130, which interact with the aminoterminal domain of T antigen (amino acid residues 102–114).

The lens is composed of an anterior monolayer of proliferative cuboidal epithelial stem cells overlying a core of terminally differentiated, post-mitotic, elongated fiber cells. At the equatorial region of the lens, epithelial cells are induced to exit from the cell cycle and to differentiate into fiber cells. Initiation of fiber cell differentiation is accompanied by up-regulation of expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Kip2 (p57) (9Zhang P. Wong C. DePinho R.A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J.

In the ocular lens, we have shown that CBP and/or p300 are important coactivators of c-Maf-mediated transcription from various crystallin promoters (16Chen Q. Dowhan D.H. Liang D. Moore D.D.

Although it has been reported that lens-specific expression of wild type SV40 large T antigen causes lens tumors and reduced expression of crystallins (3Mahon K.A. Chepelinsky A.B. Khillan J.S. Overbeek P.A. Piatigorsky J. Westphal H. Science. 1987; 235: 1622-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), little is known about whether inhibition of crystallin expression by SV40 T antigen is solely because of loss of pRb activity and cell cycle re-entry (27Morgenbesser S.D. Williams B.O. Jacks T. DePinho P.A. Nature. 1994; 371: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), or because of direct inhibition of other essential endogenous proteins. In this study, we have expressed in the lens a mutant version of SV40 large T antigen, E107KΔ, which does not bind to the pRb family members. We show that the E107KΔ protein can inhibit both fiber cell differentiation and crystallin gene expression without altering cell cycle regulation. We also show that the E107KΔ protein binds to CBP/p300 and blocks interaction of CBP/p300 with c-Maf.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of the Constructs and Transgenic Mice—The entire early region of SV40, encoding small t and large T antigens, was previously linked to the αA-crystallin promoter (Fig. 1A) (3Mahon K.A. Chepelinsky A.B. Khillan J.S. Overbeek P.A. Piatigorsky J. Westphal H. Science. 1987; 235: 1622-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For the E107KΔ construct, a BamHI/BsgI fragment from plasmid αTruncTΔ268-E107K (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was substituted for the corresponding region of the wild type clone (Fig. 1C). This fragment contains both a deletion of nucleotides 4586–4854 (Δ268) to remove the small t splice donor, and the K1 mutation (2Eckner R. Ludlow J.W. Lill N.L. Oldread E. Arany Z. Modjtahedi N.

The K1 mutation replaces glutamic acid (E) with lysine (K) at amino acid 107 (E107K) in the LXCXE motif (2Eckner R. Ludlow J.W. Lill N.L. Oldread E. Arany Z. Modjtahedi N. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3454-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was digested with KpnI and EcoRI to release a 2.5-kb fragment for microinjection (Fig. 1C). The truncated T antigen construct (Fig. 1B) has been described previously (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The fragments used for microinjection were separated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel, and purified using a Geneclean kit (Bio 101 Inc., Vista, CA). Transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear injection of the purified fragments into one-cell stage inbred FVB/N embryos (29Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Beddington R.

Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). PCR screening was performed using SV40 primers as described (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Histology—Embryonic heads at E15.5 were fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, cut as 5-μm thick sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) by standard techniques.In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridizations were performed using 35S-labeled riboprobes as described in Fromm and Overbeek (31Fromm L. Overbeek P.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 69-75PubMed Google Scholar). To test for E107KΔ transgene expression, a BamHI/PvuII fragment of E107KΔ was subcloned into pBluescript KS(-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and used to generate a specific E107KΔ riboprobe. Mouse c-Maf cDNA was obtained from Lixing Reneker (University of Missouri, Mason Eye Institute). The probes for genes involved in cell cycle regulation were generated from the following mouse cDNAs: E2F1 from Peggy Farnham (University of Wisconsin), p57 from Stephen Elledge (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), cyclins A2 and B1 from Debra Wolgemuth (Columbia University, New York, NY); and cyclin E from Julie A. DeLoia (Magee-Womens Research Institute, Pittsburgh, PA). Hybridization signals were captured as dark-field images.BrdUrd Incorporation—DNA replication was detected by 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation. BrdUrd (from Sigma, 100 μg/g body weight) was injected into pregnant female mice. One hour later, the mice were sacrificed and embryos were analyzed by immunohisto-chemistry as described previously (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence—Tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series, washed with PBS, and incubated with 10% methanol, 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS to block endogenous peroxidase activity. For detection of α-crystallins, rabbit antisera (from Samuel Zigler, National Institutes of Health) were used at 1:1000 dilution in 10% normal horse serum in PBS, with a 24-h incubation at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG was applied for 45 min at 37 °C. The secondary antibody was detected using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, and peroxidase activity was visualized with diaminobenzidine/H2O2 (Vector Laboratories, kit SK-4100). All slides were incubated in diaminobenzidine solution for 1 min. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For detection of transgenic SV40 large T antigen, endogenous c-Maf, and CBP/p300 proteins, slides were boiled in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 min using a microwave oven. Slides were then incubated with 10% normal horse serum for 1 h at 37 °C. Mouse monoclonal anti-SV40 large T antigen (1:500) (BD Biosciences), rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Maf (1:500) (Santa Cruz), mouse monoclonal anti-CBP/p300 (1:500) (Sigma), and rabbit or mouse IgG (1:500) (Vector Laboratories) were added and incubated overnight at room temperature. The slides were washed with PBS (4 × 5 min), and a secondary antibody (1:200) (biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, Vector Laboratories) was added for 1 h at room temperature. After washing 4 times with PBS, ExtrAvidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (from Sigma) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by PBS washes. The slides were mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount (Vector Laboratories).Detection of Apoptosis—DNA fragmentation was detected by TUNEL assay using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (apoTACS™: In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit, Trevigen, Inc.). Tissue sections from embryos at E15.5 were treated as described (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Chen Q. Ash J.D. Branton P. Fromm L. Overbeek P.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Western Blots—Total proteins from prenatal eyes or newborn lenses of transgenic and non-transgenic (FVB) mice were isolated. Tissue was sonicated (level 4, 30%, 25 pulses) in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, protease inhibitors (Mixture tablets, from Roche Diagnostics), 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatants were collected and the protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 20–80 μg of total lens or eye protein were denatured in 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (DuPont) membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) in TBS (Tris-buffered saline, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20) at 4 °C overnight. The blots were then incubated with the primary antibody (anti-α-crystallin, 1:500, anti-β-crystallin, 1:200, anti-γ-crystallin, 1:200, all from Samuel Zigler; anti-c-Maf, 1:500, from Santa Cruz; anti-T antigen, 1:500, from BD Biosciences) for2hat room temperature. After washing three times in TBS plus 0.5% nonfat dry milk, the blots were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, then washed and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). As a control for sample loading, the blot was stripped (in buffer: 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and re-probed with anti-actin antibody (1:500, from Dr. Jim Jung-Ching Lin, University of Iowa). To compare protein levels, quantification of the blots was performed using an imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad model GS-700).Co-immunoprecipitation—Lens lysates from prenatal non-transgenic and transgenic embryos were prepared as described above. Lens lysates (1000–2000 μg) were pretreated by addition of 80 μl of protein G-agarose beads (1:1 dilution in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 67 mm NaCl). After centrifugation, supernatants were collected and incubated with anti-CBP/p300 antibody (Sigma), anti-T-antigen antibody (BD Biosciences), or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) for 2–3 h at 4 °C, then with 80 μl of protein G beads overnight at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and assayed by Western blotting with anti-T-antigen or anti-c-Maf antibodies. For loading control, the blot was stripped and re-probed with anti-actin antibody.RESULTSMicrophthalmia in E107KΔ Transgenic Families—Previous studies have shown that expression of SV40 large T antigen in lens fiber cells induces cell cycle entry dependent upon the ability of T antigen to bind to the tumor suppressor pRb, and that cell cycle re-entry is accompanied by defects in fiber cell elongation and a reduction in β- and γ-crystallin expression (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To analyze whether T antigen can inhibit cell morphogenesis without binding to pRb, a non-pRb binding mutant of T antigen (2Eckner R. Ludlow J.W. Lill N.L. Oldread E. Arany Z. Modjtahedi N. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3454-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), which we term E107KΔ, was linked to the mouse αA-crystallin promoter (Fig. 1C), and used to generate transgenic mice. The αA-crystallin promoter typically targets transgene expression to the lens fiber cells (32Robinson M.L. Overbeek P.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2276-2284PubMed Google Scholar, 33Reneker L.W. Overbeek P.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Chen Q. Hung F. Fromm L. Overbeek P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 4223-4231PubMed Google Scholar). The E107KΔ mutant carries a mutation (E107K) in the Rb-binding motif (2Eckner R. Ludlow J.W. Lill N.L. Oldread E. Arany Z. Modjtahedi N. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3454-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) along with a deletion (Δ268) that removes the small t antigen splice donor (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Two stable transgenic families were characterized (OVE481 and OVE484). Hetero- and homozygous transgenic mice in both families exhibit severe microphthalmia (Fig. 1, D and E). Because αA-TruncTΔ268-E107K, which encodes just the first 191 amino acids of E107KΔ does not cause lens defects (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the dramatic ocular phenotype in the OVE481 and OVE484 mice is likely because of an activity that requires downstream amino acids. Mice lacking p53 do not show lens defects (35Kemp C.J. Wheldon T. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), so the E107KΔ phenotype is not because of p53 inactivation. We compared the E107KΔ mice to transgenic mice expressing either the intact early region of SV40 (OVE266A, OVE266B) (Fig. 1A), or a truncated T antigen (191 amino acids) (Fig. 1B) that binds specifically to pRb family members (OVE272) (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A summary of our transgenic studies is shown in Table I. Transgenic mice expressing full-length wild type T antigen exhibit lens tumors (Figs. 1G and 2, G and H), whereas truncated T antigen transgenic mice show microphthalmia because of induction of apoptosis (Figs. 1H and 2, I and J) (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The E107KΔ mice show a dramatic inhibition of both fiber cell morphogenesis and expression of β- and γ-crystallins.Table IT antigen transgenic lensesVersion of T antigenBinds to pRb?Induces S phase in fiber cells?Induces apoptosis in fiber cells?Binds to CBP/p300?Inhibits CBP/p300 binding to c-Maf?Blocks crystallin expression?Wild typeYesYesNoYesNoPartialTrunc.TYesYesYesNoNoPartialE107KΔNoNoNoYesYesAlmost completely Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Inhibition of fiber cell morphogenesis. Ocular histology at E15.5 is shown for the following genotypes: non-transgenic FVB (A and B), E107KΔ (OVE481 (C and D) and OVE484 (E and F)), wild type T antigen (OVE266, G and H), and truncated T (OVE272, I and J). Lens fiber cells (lf) in a normal lens (A) are elongated, post-mitotic, highly eosinophilic, and generally span the entire central diameter of the lens from the posterior lens capsule to the inner margin of the anterior epithelial cells (B). The E107KΔ transgenic mice have small lenses (C–F) with disrupted fiber cell morphogenesis (incomplete elongation), detached cells in the core of the lens and anteriorization of the transition zone (compare arrows in B, D, and F). OVE266 and OVE272 mice at E15.5 (G–J) show alterations in fiber cell elongation and alignment accompanied by the presence of multiple extra nuclei, indicative of cell cycle re-entry. Pyknotic nuclei (indicative of cell death) are visible in the truncated T antigen lens (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). B, D, F, H, and J are higher magnifications of the lenses in A, C, E, G, and I.

The small lenses show anteriorization of the differentiation zone (arrows in Fig. 2, D and F). The E107KΔ phenotype resembles that seen in c-Maf or Sox-1 knockout mice (13Ring B.Z. Cordes S.P. Overbeek P.A. Barsh G.S. Development. 2000; 127: 307-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kim J.I. Li T. Ho I.C. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3781-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our prediction when we started these experiments was that the mice would have normal lenses. Because the mice exhibited a dramatic phenotype, we have studied them to characterize the pattern of transgene expression, and to assay for alterations in cell cycle regulation, fiber cell differentiation, and expression of crystallin genes.Expression of E107KΔ in Lenses of Transgenic Mice—Based on in situ hybridizations (Fig. 3, B and C) and immunostaining using an antibody specifically against SV40 large T antigen (Fig. 3, E and F), expression of the E107KΔ transgene was lens-specific. Hybridization signals (Fig. 3, B and C) and green nuclear staining for SV40 large T antigen (Fig. 3, E and F) were found in lens epithelial and fiber cells in both transgenic families (OVE481 and OVE484). The expression of the transgene in lens epithelial cells was not typical for the αA-crystallin promoter, and might be related to the small size of the lens. In non-transgenic lenses, cell proliferation is normally confined to the epithelial cells that cover the anterior of the lens (Fig. 3G). The epithelial cells are normally induced to become post-mitotic fiber cells at the equatorial region. Lens-specific expression of either wild type or truncated SV40 T antigen, or targeted mutagenesis of the Rb gene, causes the post-mitotic lens fiber cells to re-enter S phase (4Fromm L. Shawlot W. Gunning K. Butel J.S. Overbeek P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6743-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Morgenbesser S.D. Williams B.O. Jacks T. DePinho P.A. Nature. 1994; 371: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). In contrast, posterior lens fiber cells expressing E107KΔ did not incorporate BrdUrd (Fig. 3, H and I). This result is consistent with the prediction that E107KΔ is unable to bind to pRb. It also implies that E107KΔ does not disrupt fiber cell differentiation by inducing cell cycle re-entry (Table I). TUNEL assays were performed to test for cell death in the different transgenic lenses (Table I and Fig. 3, J–L). There were no detectable apoptotic nuclei in the lens fiber cells expressing E107KΔ (Fig. 3K). Thus, the altered differentiation in E107KΔ transgenic lenses is not because of inappropriate induction of cell death.Fig. 3E107KΔ expression does not induce fiber cell proliferation or apoptosis. Expression of E107KΔ mRNA was detected using a 35S-labeled riboprobe for section in situ hybridizations to E15.5 non-transgenic (FVB) (A), transgenic OVE481 (B) and OVE484 (C) eyes. Hybridization signals were captured as dark-field images. To detect the transgenic protein, immunostaining was done using an antibody against SV40 large T antigen (D–F). E107KΔ expression (green stain) was detected in lens epithelial and fiber cells in both transgenic families (E and F). The protein localized to the nucleus. BrdUrd incorporation was assayed by immunostaining at E15.5 (G–I). BrdUrd-positive cells (brown nuclear stain) are restricted to the epithelial (e) cells in the wild-type lens (G), and to the anterior of the lens in both transgenic families (H and I). TUNEL assays were used to assay for cell death in lenses from FVB (J), OVE481 (K), and OVE272 (L) embryos. There were many apoptotic fiber cells (brown nuclear stain) in OVE272 lenses (L). No apoptosis was detected in either FVB (J) or OVE481 (K) lenses. Arrows in G–I indicate the transition zones from where the proliferating lens epithelial cells become post-mitotic fiber cells.

Glycogen synthase, which is essential for synthesizing this glucose polymer, is regulated by both covalent phosphorylation and the concentration of glucose-6-P. With the yeast glycogen synthase Gsy2p, we recently identified two mutants, R579A/R581A/R582A and R586A/R588A/R591A, in which multiple arginine residues were mutated to alanine that were completely insensitive to activation by glucose-6-P in vitro (Pederson, B. A., Cheng, C., Wilson, W. A., and Roach, P. J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 27753–27761). We report here the expression of these mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and, as expected from our findings in vitro, they were not activated by glucose-6-P. The R579A/R581A/R582A mutant, which is also resistant to inhibition by phosphorylation, caused hyperaccumulation of glycogen. In contrast, the mutant R586A/R588A/R591A, which retains the ability to be inactivated by phosphorylation, resulted in lower glycogen accumulation when compared with wild-type cells. When intracellular glucose-6-P levels were increased by mutating the PFK2 gene, glycogen storage due to the wild-type enzyme was increased, whereas that associated with R579A/R581A/R582A was not greatly changed. This is the first direct demonstration that activation of glycogen synthase by glucose-6-P in vivo is necessary for normal glycogen accumulation.

Many organisms utilize glucose as a preferred nutrient (1Johnston M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 29-33Google Scholar). After entering a cell through glucose transporters, it is converted to glucose-6-P, which can then be processed through several metabolic pathways, depending on the cell type. Glucose-6-P can enter glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, or the glycogenic pathway. In the last mentioned pathway, glucose-6-P is converted via UDP-glucose to glycogen, which serves as a glucose and energy reserve (2Francois J. Parrou J.L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 125-145Google Scholar, 3Roach P.J. Skurat A.V. Harris R.A. Cherrington A.D. Jefferson L.S. The Endocrine Pancreas and Regulation of Metabolism. 2.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15602-15607Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase activity is reduced by covalent phosphorylation at up to three sites and, as noted, activated by glucose-6-P (3Roach P.J. Skurat A.V. Harris R.A. Cherrington A.D. Jefferson L.S. The Endocrine Pancreas and Regulation of Metabolism. 2. Oxford University Press, New York2001: 609-647Google Scholar). The best characterized yeast glycogen synthase kinase is the cyclin-dependent protein kinase Pho85p, acting with the Pcl8/10p cyclins (9Huang D. Moffat J. Wilson W.A. Moore L. Cheng C. Roach P.J. Andrews B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3289-3299Google Scholar). We recently proposed a three-state model (10Pederson B.A. Cheng C. Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27753-27761Google Scholar), based on the effects of Pho85p/Pcl10p phosphorylation on enzyme kinetic properties, to describe the regulation of glycogen synthase. According to this model, the lowest activity state, I, corresponds to phosphorylated glycogen synthase in the absence of glucose-6-P. The intermediate state, II, corresponds to the dephosphorylated enzyme in the absence of glucose-6-P, and the highest activity state, III, corresponds to enzyme in the presence of glucose-6-P and is independent of the phosphorylation state. In these same studies we used scanning mutagenesis, converting Arg and Lys residues to Ala, to identify several mutant forms of Gsy2p in which activation by glucose-6-P was modified (10Pederson B.A. Cheng C. Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27753-27761Google Scholar). Two of these mutants (R579A/R581A/R582A and R586A/R588A/R591A) were mutated in a 13-residue segment that is highly conserved in glycogen synthases from different species and may be involved in a conformational transition related to the control of activity. Both mutants are completely resistant to glucose-6-P-induced increases in enzyme activity. However, although phosphorylation of R586 (R586A/R588A/R591A) 1For brevity, R586 is used to denote a glycogen synthase mutant where arginines 586, 588, and 591 were mutated to alanine. R579 denotes a glycogen synthase mutant where arginines 579, 581, and 582 were mutated to alanine. inactivated the enzyme normally, it had little effect on R579 (R579A/R581A/R582A) (Table I). By expressing the above glycogen synthase mutants in S. cerevisiae, we sought to assess the importance of allosteric activation by glucose-6-P on glycogen accumulation in cells. In summary, we provide the first direct evidence that impairment of glucose-6-P activation has a negative impact on glycogen synthesis in living cells.Table IGlycogen synthase mutantsConstructAbbreviationGlucose-6-P controlPhosphorylation controlGSY2Wild typeYesYesR579A/R581A/R582AR579NoNoR586A/R588A/R591AR586NoYes Open table in a new tab Strains and Media—Standard bacterial and yeast culture conditions and techniques for manipulation were used.

Synthetic selective medium contains 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 2% (w/v) glucose, and complete supplement mix (Bio 101 Inc.) lacking tryptophan, adenine, leucine, or uracil as appropriate. Plasmids were maintained in Escherichia coli strain DH5α. Yeast Expression Vector Construction—GSY2 wild-type and mutant coding sequences contained in the pET28a vector (10Pederson B.A. Cheng C. Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27753-27761Google Scholar) were excised with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into the high copy number plasmid p424GPD (11Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Google Scholar) digested with SmaI and XhoI. All mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Enzyme Assays—Aliquots (∼1 × 107) of cells grown in SC-Trp medium to the stationary phase were used to inoculate 25-ml liquid cultures of SC-Trp. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C and, at the indicated times, an aliquot (0.5 ml) of culture was collected for determining cell density, then another aliquot (1 ml) was collected, and cells were harvested by centrifugation for subsequent glycogen determination measurements. Synthetic complete medium (25 ml) lacking tryptophan was inoculated with yeast at a density to reach saturation after growth at 30 °C for 24 h, at which time the cells (5 ml) were harvested by centrifugation (1,500 × g in a clinical centrifuge for 1 min at room temperature). The cell pellet was frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 °C until it was analyzed for glycogen synthase protein expression and enzyme activity. Frozen cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in 300 μl of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4). Glass beads were used to break the cells as described previously (12Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27907-27913Google Scholar). This extract was used for glycogen synthase assays and Western blot analysis. Glycogen synthase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of glucose from UDP-[U-14C]glucose into glycogen by the method of Thomas et al. (13Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Google Scholar) as described by Hardy et al. (12Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27907-27913Google Scholar). Activity was measured both in the absence and presence of 7.2 mm glucose-6-P. Total activity is defined as that measured in the presence of this metabolite. The -/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio is defined as the glycogen synthase activity measured in the absence divided by activity measured in the presence of 7.2 mm glucose-6-P under standard conditions. This ratio provides a kinetic index of the relative phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase, with a low value being indicative of a highly phosphorylated enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 14Roach R.J. Larner J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1977; 15: 179-200Google Scholar). Reactions were at 30 °C, typically for 10–15 min. Rabbit liver glycogen (Sigma-Aldrich) was deionized by passage through a MBD-22 (Resintech, Inc.) mixed bed exchanger prior to use. Glycogen Determination—For analysis of glycogen accumulation in cells grown on plates, aliquots (5 μl) of yeast culture were spotted onto SC-Trp plates, and cells were grown for the indicated time before detection of glycogen by exposing plates to iodine vapor (15Chester V.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1968; 51: 49-56Google Scholar). Quantitative determination of the glycogen content of yeast cells was as previously described (16Wang Z. Wilson W.A. Fujino M.A. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5742-5752Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen cells (as described above) were resuspended with 200 μl of 20% KOH and boiled for 1 h in a water bath with occasional shaking. Samples were cooled on ice for 2 min followed by the addition of 150 μl of 5 m HCl to neutralize samples. Glycogen was precipitated with 1 ml of ice cold 95% (v/v) ethanol and then pelleted by centrifugation at 17,500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was washed twice with 66% (v/v) ethanol, dried, and re-suspended in 400 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate and 5 mm CaCl2 (pH 5.0) followed by digestion with 30 μg of amyloglucosidase and 2 μg of α-amylase at 37 °C overnight. The glucose released was quantitated as described previously by Hardy et al. (12Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27907-27913Google Scholar). The glycogen concentration was normalized to cell number. Other Methods—Western blot analysis for detecting Gsy2p used antiserum raised against a Gsy2p peptide (17Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Google Scholar). Enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) were used for detection. Protein was measured by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Densitometry was used to quantitate relative signal intensities on Western blots. Our previous mutagenesis of Gsy2p had yielded two mutants that, from analysis of recombinant protein in vitro, were impaired in their control by glucose-6-P (Table I). The objective of the present study was to exploit these mutations to judge the importance of glucose-6-P control for glycogen accumulation in vivo. To this end, we needed yeast strains lacking endogenous glycogen synthase to avoid the possible formation of heteromeric glycogen synthase complexes containing wild-type and mutant subunits that would complicate interpretation. We utilized two strains: (i) gsy1 gsy2, in which both glycogen synthase genes are deleted; and (ii) pfk2 gsy1 gsy2, which additionally lacks the β-subunit of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (encoded by PFK2). Both strains allow a plasmid-born GSY2 gene to be the only source of glycogen synthase. The latter strain has elevated glucose-6-P levels due to a block in glycolysis (19Ciriacy M. Breitenbach I. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 152-160Google Scholar, 20Lobo Z. Maitra P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1444-1449Google Scholar, 21Huang D. Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22495-22501Google Scholar) and provides a way to judge the effect of increasing the glucose-6-P concentration in vivo. Expression of these mutants, as well as of wild-type GSY2 and control vector, in gsy1 gsy2 cells was compared with wild-type yeast in terms of glycogen synthase protein level, activity, and glycogen accumulation (Fig. 1). With the control vector, the null phenotype of the host strain was reflected in undetectable levels of glycogen synthase activity and of glycogen. Transformation with plasmid encoding the wild-type glycogen synthase GSY2 resulted in a 7-fold increase in total glycogen synthase activity as compared with the parent wild-type yeast (EG328-1A), which is consistent with an ∼10-fold difference in protein level as assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 1). Despite the significant increase in total glycogen synthase activity seen with GSY2 overexpression, the -/+glucose-6-P activity ratio remained low and was, in fact, decreased (Fig. 1C). Consistent with these changes, glycogen accumulation was only modestly increased (Fig. 1B), supporting the notion that post-translational and allosteric controls operate to limit excessive glycogen synthesis even when the Gsy2p level is elevated, as has been reported also for mammalian cells (22Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Google Scholar). The two mutant forms of glycogen synthase were insensitive to glucose-6-P activation when assayed in yeast extracts, as was expected from their behavior as recombinant proteins produced in E. coli, and they had -/+glucose-6-P activity ratios ≥1 (Fig. 1C). For R586, glucose-6-P may in fact have caused a modest inhibition of activity (Fig. 1A). In terms of expression level, the R579 protein was present at ∼50% of the level of plasmid-encoded wild-type Gsy2p as judged by Western analysis (Fig. 1D) with just ∼25% of the activity in the presence of glucose-6-P. This result is consistent with the known effect of the mutation to decrease the Vmax of the enzyme (10Pederson B.A. Cheng C. Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27753-27761Google Scholar). Nonetheless, cells expressing this mutant accumulated almost twice as much glycogen as those with a wild-type GSY2 plasmid. A similar finding was obtained if glycogen was determined by staining colonies grown on solid media with iodine vapor (Fig. 2). These results fit with the mutated Gsy2p being completely insensitive to control by phosphorylation or glucose-6-P binding in vivo, hence leading to overaccumulation of glycogen despite the lowered glycogen synthase activity. Cells expressing the R586 mutant had a similar amount of Gsy2p protein as cells expressing wild-type enzyme, but the activity was only 10–15% of wild-type measured in the presence of glucose-6-P (Fig. 1). This observation is consistent with the mutant protein still being able to be inactivated by phosphorylation. The decreased activity correlated with reduced glycogen accumulation (Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that the insensitivity to glucose-6-P limited the ability of the cells to synthesize glycogen. The same plasmids were expressed in the pfk2 gsy1 gsy2 strain to assess how increased glucose-6-P in vivo affected glycogen synthesis (Figs. 2 and 3). The activity of wild-type Gsy2p was ∼40% lower in this background, with little change in the -/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio, compared with the gsy1 gsy2 strain. Still, the glycogen was increased by ∼2-fold in the pfk2 gsy1 gsy2 mutant, suggesting that the elevated glucose-6-P promotes glycogen synthesis without significant changes in the glycogen synthase phosphorylation state. With wild-type Gsy2p overexpressed in the pfk2 gsy1 gsy2 strain, the total glycogen synthase activity was ∼4-fold that in the wild-type EG328-1A strain, with a lower activity ratio but a 2–3-fold increase in glycogen accumulation over the wild-type strain (Fig. 3), again essentially duplicating the phenotype of a pfk2 mutant strain. Expression of the R579 and R586 mutants resulted in similar levels of protein as the wild-type Gsy2p (Fig. 3D). The total activity of the R579 mutant was ∼50% that of the wild-type Gsy2p, and glycogen was only slightly elevated over that associated with expression of wild-type Gsy2p. Thus, the uncontrolled R579 mutant and the wild-type enzyme, hyperactivated by glucose-6-P, led to similar degrees of glycogen hyperaccumulation. The activity of R586, which can be inactivated by phosphorylation, was lower by ∼75% compared with wild-type Gsy2p and ∼40% compared with R579, and this translated into a ∼50% decrease in glycogen storage. Therefore, control of this mutant enzyme by phosphorylation was able to exert some check on glycogen accumulation in the face of elevated glucose-6-P. The objective of this study was to assess the contribution of glucose-6-P activation of glycogen synthase to control glycogen accumulation in yeast cells. It has been proposed for years that glucose-6-P is a physiological regulator of glycogen synthase based on biochemical studies in vitro. As for all controls by ligand binding, however, actual proof of the role in vivo is difficult, and for glycogen synthase there was no such evidence. We had identified mutants of yeast Gsy2p that were insensitive to activation by glucose-6-P. One mutant (R579) was also unaffected by phosphorylation, whereas the other (R586) could still be inactivated. The mutations, which are in a highly conserved short stretch of glycogen synthase, appear to influence transitions between different activity states of glycogen synthase (10Pederson B.A. Cheng C. Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27753-27761Google Scholar). In our three-state model, both mutants would basally be in state II but are unable to reach the most active state, III, normally achieved in the presence of glucose-6-P. R579 would be irrevocably locked into state II, whereas R586 can adopt the least active state, I, following phosphorylation. When corresponding mutations were made in rabbit muscle glycogen synthase (23Hanashiro I. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 286-292Google Scholar), similar results were obtained, implying that the arginine residues important for activation by glucose-6-P are conserved. Anderson and Tatchell (24Anderson C. Tatchell K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 821-829Google Scholar) also analyzed two mutations in this same region of Gsy2p and found that one of the mutant enzymes, E590K, had a significantly increased activity ratio in vivo. The R579 and R586 mutants provide a telling means for testing the effect of disabling glucose-6-P control, alone or in combination with crippled phosphorylation control, on glycogen synthesis in vivo. An important, albeit expected, outcome of the present study was the finding that when the R579 and R586 mutants were expressed in yeast lacking endogenous glycogen synthase, their activity in yeast extracts was indeed not increased by glucose-6-P, just like the recombinant proteins produced in E. coli. This result was critical to the intent of the study. Our primary conclusion is that the ability of Gsy2p to be activated by glucose-6-P is needed for normal glycogen accumulation in yeast. Additional loss of phosphorylation control, in the completely uncontrolled R579 mutant, leads to glycogen hyperaccumulation. When increased cellular glucose-6-P concentration is engineered in the pfk2 gsy1 gsy2 strain, the expression of wild-type Gsy2p correlates with elevated glycogen accumulation, basically reproducing the phenotype of pfk2 mutants as documented previously (21Huang D. Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22495-22501Google Scholar). Expression of the R579 mutant in this strain caused a similar level of glycogen storage, as did wild-type enzyme, and only a modest increase in glycogen as compared with its expression in cells with normal glucose-6-P levels. From these results we can conclude that the cellular glucose-6-P level has relatively little impact on glycogen accumulation mediated by R579. The R586 mutant, lacking activation by glucose-6-P but still turned off by phosphorylation, accumulates the least glycogen in either background. However, comparing the glycogen levels in the presence and absence of PFK2, there is a clear increase in the pfk2 strain when the glucose-6-P is elevated. This last point suggests that glucose-6-P can affect glycogen accumulation independently of activating glycogen synthase, and, in fact, this is consistent with a number of previous observations. Especially when glucose-6-P is elevated, as in pfk (19Ciriacy M. Breitenbach I. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 152-160Google Scholar–21Huang D. Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22495-22501Google Scholar) or pgi1 (25Corominas J. Clotet J. Fernandez-Banares I. Boles E. Zimmermann F.K. Guinovart J.J. Arino J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 182-186Google Scholar) mutants, there is the possibility that impairment of glycolysis forces glucose into glycogen by mass action via elevation of UDP-glucose levels. This may be the explanation for the increased glycogen accumulation by the R579 mutant when PFK2 is null. Glucose-6-P has also been implicated as an activator of glycogen synthase phosphatase (26Francois J. Hers H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 561-567Google Scholar) and an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase (21Huang D. Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22495-22501Google Scholar), most likely via glucose-6-P-induced changes to glycogen synthase. Arguing against a glucose-6-P-mediated change in glycogen synthase phosphorylation state is the very low -/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio of wild-type Gsy2p in both the gsy1 gsy2 and pfk2 gsy1 gsy2 strains. This indicates that the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase has not been altered substantially by the higher levels of glucose-6-P found in the latter strain. For this mechanism to be relevant for mutants R579 and R586, it would require that the glucose-6-P-mediated changes in glycogen synthase that increase activity be distinct from the conformational changes affecting phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. Though not impossible, we consider this eventuality unlikely. Another glucose-6-P interaction is the inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase through the stimulation of phosphorylase dephosphorylation (27Lin K. Rath V.L. Dai S.C. Fletterick R.J. Hwang P.K. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1542Google Scholar). Although such control may indeed occur in vivo, it is unlikely to explain the differences in behavior of cells expressing the two different mutant Gsy2p enzymes. Though not the intent, the results of this study raise an interesting point regarding the use of overexpression of metabolic enzymes in cells to measure flux control coefficients in metabolic control analysis (28Fell D.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 313-330Google Scholar, 29Jensen P.R. Hammer K. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1998; 58: 191-195Google Scholar). In metabolic control analysis, the fractional change in flux through a pathway as a function of changing the amount of enzyme defines the flux control coefficient (28Fell D.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 313-330Google Scholar), and flux-determining enzymes would have a high value (up to 1 in a linear pathway). With an intricately regulated enzyme like glycogen synthase, however, we see that 7-fold overexpression of Gsy2p (wild-type Gsy2p in gsy1 gsy2 versus wild-type in Fig. 1) causes but a modest increase in glycogen accumulation, presumably reflecting the regulatory capacity of the cell to avoid excessive glycogen storage. A similar observation was made for muscle glycogen synthase expressed in COS cells (22Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Google Scholar). In the case of the unregulated R579 mutant, the result is a striking increase in glycogen accumulation (R579 in gsy1 gsy2 versus wild-type in Fig. 1). Which then is the more appropriate measure of the ability of the Gsy2p to control the flux to glycogen? While accepting that our analyses were poorly designed in terms of attempting metabolic control analysis, we would argue that, at least in its basic formulation, a meaningful flux control coefficient is not experimentally accessible for an enzyme that undergoes regulation, such as by phosphorylation. The importance of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase for yeast glycogen accumulation had been shown by site-directed mutagenesis (17Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Google Scholar) and by a genetic screen (24Anderson C. Tatchell K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 821-829Google Scholar). Elimination of even a single phosphorylation site caused glycogen hyperaccumulation. The role of glucose-6-P had been inferred from biochemical studies of yeast glycogen synthase and mutants, such as those noted above, that lead to aberrant accumulation of metabolites. The results of this investigation give the first direct evidence for glucose-6-P-mediated control of glycogen synthase in vivo, demonstrating that, without this positive input, glycogen storage is impaired as compared with wild-type enzyme. Additional loss of control by phosphorylation, however, leads to an uncontrolled enzyme and hyperaccumulation of the polysaccharide."

The penultimate Nun tryptophan residue (Trp108) mediates the interaction of Nun with the template in the TEC, possibly by intercalating into double-stranded DNA template (15Watnick R.S. Herring S.C. Palmer III, A.G. Gottesman M.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 731-739Google Scholar).Fig. 2A, the bacteriophage λ pL and pR operons. HK022 Nun and λ N compete for binding to NUTL and NUTR. Nun induces transcription arrest at sites distal to nut; N suppresses termination. rIII, an RNase III processing site, is located between nutL and the beginning of N (25Kameyama L. Fernandez L. Court D.L. Guarneros G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2953-2963Google Scholar–27Steege D.A. Cone K.C. Queen C. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17651-17658Google Scholar). B, hypothetical structure of a Nun-arrested TEC. The Nun NH2-terminal ARM domain binds the BOXB sequence in the λ nascent transcript, facilitating the binding of the COOH terminus to RNAP and to λ DNA template. Contacts to RNAP involve Nun residues, His93, His98, and His100 and require Zn2+ ion. Trp108 is shown intercalating into DNA, aided by positive charges on Lys106 and Lys107. Nun binding to BOXB blocks binding of λ N antitermination protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this article, we investigate the role of Nun residues Lys106 and Lys107 in transcription arrest and λ exclusion. We showed previously that substitution of these basic residues with aspartate (Nun K106D/K107D) strongly inhibited transcription termination in vivo (16Kim H.C. Zhou J.G. Wilson H.R. Mogilnitskiy G. Court D.L. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5308-5312Google Scholar). Nun K106D/K107D could, however, prevent translation of the λ N gene in an rnc host (16Kim H.C. Zhou J.G. Wilson H.R. Mogilnitskiy G. Court D.L. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5308-5312Google Scholar). This suggested that Nun K106D/K107D bound λ BOXB, and, along with E. coli Nus factors, blocked ribosomal access to the adjacent N ribosome-binding site (16Kim H.C. Zhou J.G. Wilson H.R. Mogilnitskiy G. Court D.L. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5308-5312Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that Nun Lys106 and Lys107 are not required for binding to RNAP or BOXB but are instead involved in binding to DNA template. We propose that favorable electrostatic interactions between Nun Lys106 and Lys107 and template phosphate groups assist intercalation of Nun Trp108 into the λ DNA template. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Bacteriophage—Standard bacteriological techniques used in strain construction, e.g. transformation, transduction, and media preparation are as described previously (17Silhavy T. Berman M. Enquist L. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984Google Scholar). The bacterial host is W3102. Strains carrying either pL-nutL-lacZ chromosomal transcriptional fusion (18Wilson H.R. Kameyama L. Zhou J.G. Guarneros G. Court D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2204-2213Google Scholar), or pR-nutR-galETK chromosomal transcriptional fusion (2Robledo R. Gottesman M.E. Weisberg R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 635-643Google Scholar), are described in detail below. All plasmids were constructed from pET-21d vector (Novagen). Plasmids expressing wild-type Nun, K106D/K107D, and T-Nun (Nun V96) are as described previously (16Kim H.C. Zhou J.G. Wilson H.R. Mogilnitskiy G. Court D.L. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5308-5312Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing K106R/K107R, K106A/K107A, 110C, K106A/K107A110C, K106R/K107R110C, and K106D/K107D110C are described in detail below. For the λ plaque forming assay, wild-type λ imm434 cI was used. Proteins—For in vitro transcription, BOXB binding, and RNA polymerase binding experiments, wild-type and Nun mutants, K106A/K107A, K106R/K107R, and K106D/K107D were purified as described previously (9Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1546-1551Google Scholar). For T-Nun purification, additional steps were applied. After anion exchange chromatography with Mono S HR 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences), fractions containing T-Nun protein were combined and concentrated to 500 μl with Centricon YM-10 (10,000 molecular weight cutoff) (Amicon). Subsequently, T-Nun was size-separated from other proteins with Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). E. coli holo RNAP was purchased from Epicenter (Madison, WI). For cross-linking experiment, Nun mutants, 110C, K106A/K107A110C, K106R/K107R110C, and K106D/K107D110C, were purified as described previously (9Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1546-1551Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—K106D/K107D and T-Nun (Nun V96) protein mutants were constructed from the pT7NunII plasmid as described previously (16Kim H.C. Zhou J.G. Wilson H.R. Mogilnitskiy G. Court D.L. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5308-5312Google Scholar). The K106A/K107A and K106R/K107R mutations were made using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis technique (Stratagene) from the pT7NunII plasmid. The primers used to make these mutations were as follows: K106A/K107A, GCT CAC CAG CGA AAC CCA AAC GCA GCG TGG TCA TAA AAG CTT GC and GCA AGC TTT TAT GAC CAC GCT GCG TTT GGG TTT CGC TGG TGA GC; K106R/K107R, GCT CAC CAG CGA AAC CCA AAC AGA AGG TGG TCA TAA AAG CTT GC and GCA AGC TTT TAT GAC CAC CTT CTG TTT GGG TTT CGC TGG TGA GC. For 110C, K106A/K107A110C, K106R/K107R110C, and K106D/K107D110C mutations, wild-type, K106A/K107A, K106R/K107R, and K106D/K107D Nun was used, respectively, as a template. The primers used to make these mutations were as follows: 110C, CCA GCG AAA CCC AAA CAA AAA GTG GTC ATG CTA AAA GCT TGC and GCA AGC TTT TAG CAT GAC CAC TTT TTG TTT GGG TTT CGC TGG; K106A/K107A110C, GCT CAC CAG CGA AAC CCA AAC GCA GCG TGG TCA TGC TAA AAG CTT GC and GCA AGC TTT TAG CAT GAC CAC GCT GCG TTT GGG TTT CGC TGG TGA GC; K106R/K107R110C, GCT CAC CAG CGA AAC CCA AAC AGA AGG TGG TCA TGC TAA AAG CTT GC and GCA AGC TTT TAG CAT GAC CAC CTT CTG TTT GGG TTT CGC TGG TGA GC; K106D/K107D110C, GCT CAC CAG CGA AAC CCA AAC GAC GAC TGG TCA TGC TAA AAG CTT GC and GCA AGC TTT TAG CAT GAC CAG TCG TCG TTT GGG TTT CGC TGG TGA GC. β-Galactosidase and Galactokinase Assays—Cultures were grown in LB + 50 μg/ml of ampicillin at 32 °C and shifted to 42 °C for 1 h with shaking to OD600 = 0.6 for β-galactosidase assays (19Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) and for 7 h to OD650 = 0.5–0.7 for galactokinase measurements (20Adhya S. Miller W. Nature. 1979; 279: 492-494Google Scholar). The shift to 42 °C inactivates the λ cI857 repressor and initiates transcription from the λ pL (β-galactosidase assays) or pR promoter (galactokinase assays). Efficiency of λ Plating—Lawns of strains were poured in top agar on LB or LB + 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Efficiency of λ plating was determined by spotting dilutions of λ phage and incubating overnight at 37 °C. In Vitro Transcription Assay—This assay was based on two-step, multiround transcription reaction. In the first step, open complex formation was allowed by preincubating E. coli RNAP (20 nm), DNA template (10 nm) in 50 μl of transcription buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 60 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol at 32 °C for 10 min. In the second step, transcription was initiated by addition of 5 μm ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP and 1–2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, and where indicated, wild-type or Nun mutant was added. The final concentration of wild type, K106A/K107A, K106R/K107R, K106D/K107D, or T-Nun in the elongation mixture was 200 nm. Transcription elongation was continued at 32 °C for 20 min. The transcription reaction was then terminated by addition of a 50-μl stop solution containing 375 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 62.5 mm EDTA, and 1 μg of yeast tRNA. Transcription products were then phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol (Sigma), and resuspended in 20 μl of gel loading buffer II (Amicon). Extracted transcripts were electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel at constant power of 24 watts for 2 h and analyzed by autoradiography. Templates for in Vitro Transcription, BOXB RNA Synthesis, and Cross-linking—For in vitro transcription assay, a λ DNA fragment (35,253–35,718) carrying pL-nutL was amplified from λ DNA/HindIII markers (Fermentas, Hanover, MD) by PCR using GeneAmp (Roche Diagnostics) and the following two primers: TCA GAT CTC TCA CCT ACC AAA C and AGG GCG GTT AAC TGG TTT TG. The PCR product was then purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). For the nutR boxB template, two complimentary DNA oligonucleotides with 5′ EcoRI and 3′ HindIII restriction sites (MWG Biotech) annealed. The oligonucleotides used were GGC GAA TTC ACA TTC CAG CCC TGA AAA AGG GCA TCA AAT AAG CTT GCG and CGC AAG CTT ATT TGA TGC CCT TTT TCA GGG CTG GAA TGT GAA TTC GCC. After annealing, the boxB template was cloned into pGEM-3Z (Promega). Both pGEM-3Z vector and the double-stranded template were digested with EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes at 37 °C for 30 min. Linearized pGEM-3Z was purified with the PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and the boxB template was purified by nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). 6 pmol of boxB template and 2 pmol of linearized pGEM-3Z were ligated in a 16 °C water bath for 6 h. The ligated mixture was then transformed into XL-1B supercompetent cells (Stratagene) and grown on LB + 50 μg/μl ampicillin plate at 37 °C overnight. Colonies were purified and miniprepped, and the presence of boxB template was confirmed by sequencing. For cross-linking, λ DNA fragment (35,409–35,659) was amplified with the following primers: ATA CAG ATA ACC ATC TGC GGT GAT and TGA ACG AAA ACC CCC CGC GAT TGG. 5′-Phosphates were removed by addition of calf intestine phosphatase (Fermentas). Template was then labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). BOXB Synthesis and Gel Mobility Shift Assays—10 μg of pGEM-3Z/nutRboxB was digested with HindIII at 37 °C for 30 min and then purified with the PCR purification Kit (Qiagen). In vitro transcription was performed with 6 μg of the template using the T7-MEGAshort-script kit (Ambion) for 4 h. Template was eliminated by incubation with 2.5 units of RNase-free DNase I (Stratagene) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then purified with the nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen), loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel, and analyzed by autoradiography. α-32P-Labeled BOXB (100 nm) was incubated for 10 min on ice with wild type or K106A/K107A, K106R/K107R, and K106D/K107D Nun (200 nm) in a 20-μl reaction containing 20 nm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 2 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml poly(A)·poly(U), 5% glycerol. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 7% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed at 6 watts for 5 h at 4 °C, and analyzed by autoradiography. DNA Cross-linking—500 pmol of wild-type Nun (Nun 110C) or mutant Nun (K106A/K107A110C, K106R/K107R110C, K106D/K107D110C) in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) was reduced with 50 mm DTT at 37 °C for 30 min and desalted with a G25 column essentially as described previously (10Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 2337-2339Google Scholar). The buffer was then exchanged with 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.4). The following procedures were carried out in the dark under red light illumination. N-[(2-Pyridyldithio)ethyl]-4-azidosalicylamide (AET) (Molecular Probes) was dissolved in Me2SO and serially diluted with phosphate-buffered saline. To attach AET to Nun C110, wild-type or mutant Nun (20 μl) was incubated with 2 nmol of AET (10 μl) on ice for 30 min. The reaction product was passed through a G25 desalting column to remove excess unreacted AET. For the preparation of TEC, transcription was allowed to proceed to the +15 position of the template (10 nm) by incubating RNAP (20 nm) at 32 °C for 20 min with a mixture of 5 μm ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs), lacking rUTP in 30 μl of transcription buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 60 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm zinc chloride, and 5% glycerol. AET-Nun (500 pmol) was then added to the paused elongation complex. At this concentration, Nun binding to TEC is independent of BOXB. After 30-min incubation, the reaction mixture was UV-irradiated with a hand-held UVGL-25 lamp (UVP, San Gabriel, CA) for 2 min at the short wavelength setting with a maximum wavelength of 254 nm and stopped with 5 mm EDTA. As a control, AET-Nun was incubated with template DNA in the absence of RNAP and rNTPs and irradiated with UV light in the same manner described above. The DNA was purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). For wild-type Nun, the DNA was divided into two samples, one of which was treated with 50 mm DTT at room temperature for 10 min to cleave AET from Nun. All samples were then heated to 95 °C to melt template DNA and loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. 32P-Labeled template DNA was loaded as marker. Gel Filtration Chromatography—For RNAP binding, 5 μm RNAP (Epicenter) was incubated with 10 μm wild type, K106A/K107A, K106R/K107R, K106D/K107D, or T-Nun (Nun V96) at 4 °C for 10 min in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 μm zinc chloride. For gel preparation, 1 g of Sephadex G-100 superfine (Amersham Biosciences) beads was swollen overnight with 30 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 μm zinc chloride. For the column, 1.5 ml of Sephadex G-100 gel slurry was loaded onto a Bio-Spin Chromatography column (Bio-Rad). The excess packing buffer was initially drained by gravity and then by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 4 min. For gel filtration, the reaction binding mixture was applied to the Sephadex G-100 column and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min. The eluates were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Coommassie Blue staining. Effect of Mutations in Nun Residues Lys106 and Lys107 on Termination Activity in Vivo—Nun arrests transcription on the λ chromosome at many different sites distal to the λ nut sequences (21Baron J. Weisberg R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1983-1989Google Scholar, 22Hung S.C. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 11: 2670-2678Google Scholar). Interaction between Nun and λ DNA template does not, therefore, involve specific DNA base contacts. Instead, it depends on interactions between the planar aromatic Nun Trp108 residue and double strand DNA. Trp108 may intercalate into DNA (15Watnick R.S. Herring S.C. Palmer III, A.G. Gottesman M.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 731-739Google Scholar). Nun residues Lys106 and Lys107 lie adjacent to Trp108 (Fig. 1). We asked whether these basic amino acids have a role in Nun-dependent transcription termination in vivo, perhaps by neutralizing negative DNA charges and allowing W108 to interact with template. Plasmids expressing Nun mutants were transformed into E. coli strains carrying Nun-sensitive transcriptional chromosomal fusions. N8499 carries λ pL-nutL-lacZ, and N7499 carries λ pR-cro-nutR-tR1-galETK. The λ cI857 repressor controls both promoters. Transcription from the λ pL or λ pR promoter was initiated by shifting cultures from 32 to 42 °C, which inactivates the repressor. Nun termination efficiency was determined by β-galactosidase (Table I) or galactokinase assay (Table II).Table ITermination efficiency of Nun lysine mutants at pL-nutLMutationβ-GalactosidaseTerminationunits%pET-21d8320Wild-type Nun8100K106R4100K107R12100K106R/K107R1599K106A4496K107A3697K106A/K107A18079K106D9589K107D8391K106D/K107D42949 Open table in a new tab Table IITermination efficiency of Nun lysine mutants at pR-nutRMutationGalactokinaseTerminationunits%PET21d2.30Wild-type Nun0.4100K106R0.3100K107R0.590K106R/K107R0.590K106A0.970K107A0.685K106A/K107A2.40K106D1.825K107D1.730K106D/K107D5.9—aThe high galactokinase unit represents suppression of termination at tR1.a The high galactokinase unit represents suppression of termination at tR1. Open table in a new tab As shown in Table I, replacement of either or both lysines with arginine, another basic amino acid (K106R, K107R, and K106R/K107R) had no effect on Nun activity in the λ pL-nutL operon. Alanine substitution of either Lys106 or Lys107 slightly decreased termination activity. Substitution of both lysines (Nun K106A/K107A) reduced transcription termination to 79% wild-type levels. Replacement of a single lysine with a negatively charged aspartate residue also reduced Nun activity; K106D and K107D were 89 and 91% as active as wild-type Nun, respectively. However, Nun K106D/K107D, which carries negative charges at both residues 106 and 107, was only 49% as active as wild-type Nun. The effects of mutations at Lys106 and Lys107 on termination in the λ pR-nutR operon are shown in Table II. Substitution of one or both lysine residues with arginine did not dramatically reduce activity. Nun mutants K106R, K107R, and K106R/K107R all terminated transcription with at least 90% efficiency. The effects of alanine and aspartate substitutions were more dramatic. K106A and K107A were 85 and 70% as active as wild type, respectively, and K106A/K107A had no termination activity. Substitution of either Lys106 or Lys107 with aspartate reduced Nun termination efficiency 3–4-fold. As reported previously (16Kim H.C. Zhou J.G. Wilson H.R. Mogilnitskiy G. Court D.L. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5308-5312Google Scholar), substitution of both lysines with aspartate increased galactokinase levels more than 2-fold relative to Nun– controls. We suggest that Nun K106D/K107D is inactive as a termination factor but binds to BOXB at NUTR and sterically inhibits access of Rho to the λ tR1 terminator (16Kim H.C. Zhou J.G. Wilson H.R. Mogilnitskiy G. Court D.L. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5308-5312Google Scholar). Overall, these results indicate that the positive charges carried by Lys106 and Lys107 facilitate Nun termination activity, presumably by interacting with negatively charged DNA template. It also confirms that the λ pL-nutL operon is more forgiving of Nun mutations than the λ pR-nutR operon, a point to which we return under “Discussion.” Substitutions at Nun Positions 106 and 107 Affect λ Exclusion—Nun residues Lys106 and Lys107 also play a key role in λ exclusion (Table III). Phage λ failed to form plaques on strains expressing wild-type Nun or Nun variants K106R, K107R, and K106R/K107R. Similarly, Nun K106A and K107A completely excluded λ. However, single aspartate substitutions (K106D, K107D) partially inhibited exclusion (efficiency of plating = ∼<10–4). Furthermore, Nun K106A/K107A and K106D/K107D failed entirely to block λ plating (efficiency of plating = 1.0). These results indicate that position 106 or 107 must carry a positively charged amino acid for Nun to block transcription on infecting λ chromosomes.Table IIIEffect of Nun mutations on efficency of λ plaque formationMutationEfficiency of platingPET-21d1.0Wild-type Nun<10-6K106R<10-6K107R<10-6K106R/K107R<10-6K106A<10-6K107A<10-6K106A/K107A1.0K106D<10-4K107D<10-4K106D/K107D1.0 Open table in a new tab Effect of Mutations on Lys106 and Lys107 in Transcription Arrest in Vitro—We next tested the Nun mutants in a minimal in vitro transcription system. In this assay, Nun arrests transcription without releasing stalled TEC. As template, we used a 466-bp (35,253–35,718) DNA fragment containg pL-nutL, which was amplified from λ genomic DNA/HindIII (Fig. 3). Nun arrest activity is indicated by reduction in run-off transcripts (RO) and the appearance of specific short RNAs (NA; Fig. 3, lanes 3, 4, and 6). As reported previously (9Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1546-1551Google Scholar), T-Nun (T), a truncated form of Nun that lacks the COOH-terminal 13 amino acid residues, was entirely inactive (Fig. 3, lane 2). Nun K106A/K107A (AA) and K106R/K107R (RR) both arrested transcription, although the former was less active than K106R/K107R (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 6). Nun K106D/K107D failed completely to arrest transcription (Fig. 3, lane 5). This in vitro data further supports the hypothesis that the electrostatic interaction between Nun residues Lys106 and Lys107 and the DNA template facilitates Nun-dependent transcription arrest. BOXB and RNAP Binding by Wild-type and Nun Lys106/107 Mutants—In addition to contacting DNA template, Nun transcription termination entails two additional binding reactions. First, Nun is recruited to the TEC by binding of the NH2-terminal ARM domain to the BOXB elements of the λ nascent transcript NUT sequences (Fig. 2B; Refs. 7Chattopadhyay S. Hung S.C. Stuart A.C. Palmer III, A.G. Garcia-Mena J. Das A. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12131-12135Google Scholar and 8Oberto J. Weisberg R.A. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 675-693Google Scholar). Second, Nun binds to RNA polymerase, either in the TEC or in solution (9Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1546-1551Google Scholar, 10Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 2337-2339Google Scholar). Binding is Zn2+-dependent and is promoted by Nun residues His93, His98, and His100 (Fig. 2B). 2H. C. Kim and M. E. Gottesman, unpublished results. We asked whether Lys106 and Lys107 played a role in these interactions. The ability of Nun mutants, K106A/K107A, K106R/K107R, and K106D/K107D to bind BOXB was tested by a native gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 4A). All mutants bound BOXB with approximately wild-type efficiency. Averaging three independent experiments, under these conditions wild-type Nun bound 47% (±6.5%) of input BOXB, whereas Nun K106D/K107D bound 48% (±15.7%). Binding of wild-type and mutant Nun to RNAP was compared using size exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-100 superfine column (Fig. 4B). Under our assay conditions, wild-type Nun binds to RNAP (Fig. 4B, lane 2), whereas T-Nun is retained in the column (Fig. 4B, lane 6). Wild-type Nun, the arrest-proficient Nun mutants, K106A/K107A and K106R/K107R, and the arrest-defective Nun mutant K106D/K107D, all bound RNAP (Fig. 4B, lanes 2–5). These results indicate that substitutions at Lys106 and Lys107 that abrogate transcription arrest do not affect the ability of Nun to bind to BOXB or RNAP. Lys106 and Lys107 Promote Nun-DNA Contacts—Nun can be photochemically cross-linked to λ DNA template in a Nun-arrested TEC (10Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 2337-2339Google Scholar). Cross-linking is dependent on Nun residue Trp108. The results reported above suggest that Lys106 and Lys107 help position Trp108 at the template by neutralizing DNA negative charges. To demonstrate cross-linking, we used Nun derivatives carrying an additional C110 residue linked by a disulfide bond to the photoreactive cross-linker, AET (Fig. 5; Ref. 10Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 2337-2339Google Scholar). The 251 bp pL-nutL DNA fragment described under “Materials and Methods” was used as a transcription template after dephosphorylation and 5′-end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP. Transcription was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 5. As reported previously (10Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 2337-2339Google Scholar), AET-Nun did not cross-link [32P]DNA template in the absence of a TEC (Fig. 5, lane 2). Incubation of the TEC with Nun110C yielded an Nun-AET-[32P]DNA complex that migrated slower in the gel than the labeled template marker (Fig. 5, lane 3). As expected, the complex was sensitive to DTT, which reduces the disulfide bond in Nun-S-S-AET-[32P]DNA complex (Fig. 5, lane 4). Nun K106R/K107R110C showed the same cross-linking pattern as wild-type Nun (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 7). K106A/K107A110C formed less complex with template DNA than wild-type Nun (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 5). Finally, K106D/K107D110C failed to cross-link template (Fig. 5, lane 6). We conclude that the transcription termination/arrest defect of K106D/K107D is explained by its inability to contact template DNA. Prophage HK022 Nun protein and phage λ N protein bind the same NUT sequences in λ nascent transcript (7Chattopadhyay S. Hung S.C. Stuart A.C. Palmer III, A.G. Garcia-Mena J. Das A. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12131-12135Google Scholar, 21Baron J. Weisberg R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1983-1989Google Scholar). However, Nun induces transcription arrest, whereas N both accelerates the rate of transcription elongation and suppresses transcription termination (6Das A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6711-6716Google Scholar). The functional differences between Nun and N are specified by their unique carboxyl-terminal regions (23Henthorn K.S. Friedman D.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 9-20Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of Nun is required for Nun transcription arrest both in vivo and in vitro. A truncated variant of Nun, T-Nun, which lacks Nun residues 97–109, is completely inactive in blocking transcription elongation (9Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1546-1551Google Scholar). T-Nun binds BOXB sequences within NUTL and NUTR (9Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1546-1551Google Scholar) but, unlike wild-type Nun, fails to interact with RNAP (9Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1546-1551Google Scholar, 10Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 2337-2339Google Scholar) or DNA template. 3H. C. Kim and M. E. Gottesman, unpublished results. The contribution of Nun carboxyl-terminal residues to transcription arrest has been explored by genetic and biochemical analyses. Histidine residues His93, His98, and His100 coordinate Zn2+ (15Watnick R.S. Herring S.C. Palmer III, A.G. Gottesman M.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 731-739Google Scholar) and are required for binding to RNAP.2 The penultimate Nun residue, Trp108, plays a critical role in Nun arrest. There are suggestions that Trp108 may intercalate in the λ template, allowing Nun to act as a brake to TEC translocation. Thus Nun does not arrest transcription on single strand DNA (15Watnick R.S. Herring S.C. Palmer III, A.G. Gottesman M.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 731-739Google Scholar). Furthermore, although Nun W108A or Nun W108L fails to terminate λ transcription, substitution of Trp108 with another aromatic planar amino acid, tyrosine, is innocuous (15Watnick R.S. Herring S.C. Palmer III, A.G. Gottesman M.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 731-739Google Scholar). Finally, Nun arrests transcription at many sites promoter-distal to NUT (21Baron J. Weisberg R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1983-1989Google Scholar, 22Hung S.C. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 11: 2670-2678Google Scholar). This suggests that specific amino acid-nucleotide interactions are not involved in Nun transcription arrest. Nun W108A, although it interacts with a TEC, does not form stable contacts with DNA (10Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 2337-2339Google Scholar). Interaction of Nun with template occurs only in the context of a TEC (Ref. 10Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 2337-2339Google Scholar and this work) and entails contacts between Nun and RNAP. Nun H93A, like W108A, does not cross-link template (10Watnick R.S. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 2337-2339Google Scholar). Two basic residues, Lys106 and Lys107 lie adjacent to Trp108 (Fig. 1). We present evidence above that Lys106 and Lys107 facilitate the proper positioning of the Nun carboxyl terminus near the template by electrostatic interactions with DNA. Thus, K106D/K107D is defective for λ exclusion and for transcription termination in vivo and fails to arrest transcription in vitro. Importantly, K106D/K107D does not cross-link with DNA template. In contrast, K106R/K107R, which preserves the basic charges at positions 106 and 107, is fully active in transcription arrest and in cross-linking DNA. K106A/K107A cross-links template DNA with an efficiency intermediate between wild-type or K106R/K107R and K106D/K107D. The defect in the Nun pathway of K106D/K107D is accounted for entirely by inability to interact with template DNA. The mutant protein binds BOXB and RNAP in vitro with wild-type efficiency. Evidence for binding of K106D/K107D to BOXB in vivo has been reported previously (16Kim H.C. Zhou J.G. Wilson H.R. Mogilnitskiy G. Court D.L. Gottesman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5308-5312Google Scholar). We conclude that Lys106 and Lys107 act to neutralize negative charges on DNA template, allowing Nun to interact with template and to block translocation of the TEC. In general, Nun proteins mutated at residues 106 and 107 are less active at nutR than at nutL. Thus, K106D/K107D and K106A/K107A induce 49% and 79% termination at nutL, respectively, but are entirely inactive at nutR. In this respect, Nun mutants act like host nus and rpoC mutants, which suppress Nun at nutR but have little effect at nutL (2Robledo R. Gottesman M.E. Weisberg R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 635-643Google Scholar, 24Burova E. Hung S.C. Chen J. Court D.L. Zhou J.G. Mogilnitskiy G. Gottesman M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1783-1793Google Scholar). Two factors contribute to the difference between nutL and nutR. First, nutL lies only 34 bp from pL, whereas nutR is separated by 227 bp from pR (14Washburn R.S. Wang Y. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 655-662Google Scholar). The proximity of nutL to its cognate promoter may block access of host transcription repair-coupling factor to the Nun-arrested TEC, thus prolonging the half-life of the complex (14Washburn R.S. Wang Y. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 655-662Google Scholar). Second, the λ pL operon includes the RNase III-sensitive site, rIII, which lies just distal to nutL (Fig. 2A; Refs. 25Kameyama L. Fernandez L. Court D.L. Guarneros G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2953-2963Google Scholar, 26Lozeron H.A. Dahlberg J.E. Szybalski W. Virology. 1976; 71: 262-277Google Scholar, 27Steege D.A. Cone K.C. Queen C. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17651-17658Google Scholar). rIII enhances Nun activity, perhaps by making contacts with Nun residues. 4R. S. Washburn, H. C. Kim, and M. E. Gottesman, manuscript in preparation. Alanine scanning of the Nun 13 carboxyl-terminal amino acids (Asn97–Ser109; Fig. 1) revealed that an R102A substitution reduced termination efficiency to 67% at pL-nutL and completely abolished activity at pR-nutR (data not shown). In contrast to Lys106 and Lys107, however, substitution with another basic amino acid (R102K) was equally disabling. The role of Arg102 in transcription termination, therefore, appears to be unrelated to its charge. We thank Robert Washburn for helpful discussions."

In this study, the kinetic parameters of mutants at highly conserved aromatic residues, Tyr33, Phe35, Phe79, and Phe278-Phe279, in the vicinity of the catalytic centers of FEN-1 were examined. The substitution of these aromatic residues with alanine led to a large reduction in kcat values, although these mutants retained Km values similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. Notably, the kcat of Y33A and F79A decreased 333-fold and 71-fold, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. The aromatic residues Tyr33 and Phe79, and the aromatic cluster Phe278-Phe279 mainly contributed to the recognition of the substrates without the 3′ projection of the upstream strand (the nick, 5′-recess-end, single-flap, and pseudo-Y substrates) for the both exo- and endo-activities, but played minor roles in recognizing the substrates with the 3′ projection (the double flap substrate and the nick substrate with the 3′ projection). The replacement of Tyr33, Phe79, and Phe278-Phe279, with non-charged aromatic residues, but not with aliphatic hydrophobic residues, recovered the kcat values almost fully for the substrates without the 3′ projection of the upstream strand, suggesting that the aromatic groups of Tyr33, Phe79, and Phe278-Phe279 might be involved in the catalytic reaction, probably via multiple stacking interactions with nucleotide bases. The stacking interactions of Tyr33 and Phe79 might play important roles in fixing the template strand and the downstream strand, respectively, in close proximity to the active center to achieve the productive transient state leading to the hydrolysis.

Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and is required for non-homologous end joining of double-stranded DNA breaks (9Wu X. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Proc.

The flap endonuclease activity has been shown to require the upstream primer, which fills up the junction portion, and expanding the 3′ of the upstream primer known as a double flap structure elevates the activity (12Storici F.

The 5′→3′ exonuclease activity digested the double-stranded DNA containing the nick, gap, and 5′-recess-end, and the activity was elevated by expanding the 3′-end of the upstream primer in the nick portion (1Matsui E.

The molecular structure of the members of the FEN-1 family, T5 exonuclease, T4 RNase H, and the exonuclease domain of Taq polymerase were also reported (18Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D.

Several residues identified as DNA binding sites were located on the large loop (12Storici F. Henneke G. Ferrari E. Gordenin D.A. Hubscher U.

Kaiser M.W. Onufriev A.V. Ma W.P. Brogaard A.E. Case D.A. Neri B.P. Lyamichev V.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 537-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two binding models for Pyrococcus furiosus and T5 bacteriophage FEN-1 showed that the helix-hairpin-helix region interacted with the downstream duplex DNA, and the flap strand interacted with the helical arch of FEN-1. However, the DNA binding mechanism is still unclear, because the number of DNA binding sites identified was too small to understand the substrate recognition. We previously investigated the substrate specificity of phFEN-1 in detail using 35 different substrates (1Matsui E. Kawasaki S. Ishida H. Ishikawa K. Kosugi Y. Kikuchi H. Kawarabayashi Y. Matsui I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18297-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity was similar to that of eukaryote FEN-1, except that phFEN-1 could cleave a flap strand having a double strand, suggesting that phFEN-1 might recognize strongly the junction portion of the flap strand rather than the 5′-end. Furthermore, the crystal structure of phFEN-1 was solved, and the large loop and small loop 2 (Fig. 2) were suggested to be very flexible by superimposing three kinds of structures from archaea FEN-1s (17Matsui E. Musti K.V. Abe J. Yamasaki K. Matsui I. Harata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37840-37847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating that the structures of two loops might change remarkably for binding to the substrate DNA. The four DNA binding sites on the large loop and small loops were identified by site-directed mutagenesis (17Matsui E. Musti K.V. Abe J. Yamasaki K. Matsui I. Harata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37840-37847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These consist of basic residues presumably bound to phosphate moieties of the DNA strand. We successfully elucidated the functions of the four DNA binding sites that form productive ES complexes for exo- and endo-activities, probably by bending the substrates. In this study, we investigated the functions of aromatic residues close to the active center and report here the significant roles for these residues and the substrate recognition mechanism of FEN-1 in the formation of the productive intermediates probably through a partial unwinding of the substrates via stacking interactions with the central aromatic residues. Chemicals—The vector pET-11b and Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). The restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was obtained from Takara Shuzo (Japan). Oligonucleotides labeled with the fluorescent dye fluorescein (FAM) were purchased from Sawady Technology, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Oligonucleotides substituted with 2′-O-methyl at the 2′ position of the deoxyribose were purchased from Espec Oligo Service Corp. (Japan). Expression and Purification of Recombinant phFEN-1s—Each mutant gene was constructed on the basis of the vector pGEMEX/FEN-1 using site-directed mutagenesis and the PCR method. The wild type and mutated genes were inserted into the vector pET-11a using NdeI and XhoI sites, resulting in the expression vectors pET-11a/phFEN-1s. The presence of desired mutations and the absence of unwanted mutations were verified by sequencing. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with the expression vectors. The transformant was propagated in 200 ml of 2× YT medium containing ampicillin at 37 °C. The recombinant protein was induced at A600 = 1.0-1.5 with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at -20 °C. The frozen cells were then thawed at room temperature and mixed with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The sample was heated at 83 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 2300 × g for 30 min, then the supernatant was again heated at 83 °C for 15 min to remove endogenous proteases completely before being centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded on a HiTrap SP column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 1 m NaCl in a 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. The recombinant phFEN-1s were eluted with buffer containing 200-300 m NaCl. Oligonucleotides Used and Preparation of Substrates—The following oligonucleotides were designed to construct various DNA substrates: Oligonucleotide A, 54-mer, 5′-GAGCTAGATGTCGGACTCTGCCTCAAGACGGTAGTCAACGTGCACTCGAGGTCA-3′; Oligonucleotide B-1, 26-mer, 5′-TGACCTCGAGTGCACGTTGACTACCG-3′; Oligonucleotide B-2, 27-mer, 5′-TGACCTCGAGTGCACGTTGACTACCGC-3′; Oligonucleotide C-1, 28-mer, 5′-TCTTGAGGCAGAGTCCGACATCTAGCTC-3′; Oligonucleotide C-2, 32-mer, 5′-TAACTCTTGAGGCAGAGTCCGACATCTAGCTC-3′; Oligonucleotide C-3, 57-mer, 5′-GCATCTGACGGATGTCAAGCAGTCCTAACTCTTGAGGCAGAGTCCGACATCTAGCTC-3′. Oligonucleotides C-1, C-2, and C-3 were labeled at the 5′ terminus with a fluorescence group (FAM) and then purified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Annealing reactions to construct various DNA substrates were performed as described previously (1Matsui E. Kawasaki S. Ishida H. Ishikawa K. Kosugi Y. Kikuchi H. Kawarabayashi Y. Matsui I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18297-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The double flap substrate with a 3′ projection having a complementary sequence to oligonucleotide A was constructed with oligonucleotides A, B-2, and C-3 labeled with FAM. The single flap substrate was constructed with oligonucleotides A, B-1, and C-2 labeled with FAM. The pseudo-Y substrate was constructed with oligonucleotides A and C-2 labeled with FAM. The nick substrate was constructed with oligonucleotides A, B-1, and C-1 labeled with FAM. The nick substrate with the 3′ projection was constructed with A, B-2, and C-1 labeled with FAM. The 5′-recessend substrate was constructed with oligonucleotides A and C-1 labeled with FAM. Measurement of Kinetic Parameters—The kinetic parameters were determined using the fluorescence substrates. The reaction mixture was comprised of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing the labeled substrate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1.5 μg of bovine serum albumin. The enzyme and substrate concentrations ranged from 0.025 to 200 ng and from 0.1 to 75 pmol, respectively. A 10-fold volume (150 μl) of the reaction mixture was preheated at 60 °C for 5 min, and 14 μl was added to 10 μl of stop solution as a control for a zero time reaction. Nine volumes of enzyme were added, and 15 μl of the reaction mixture was added to 10 μl of the stop solution every 1 min for 7 min. The samples were denatured at 95 °C for 10 min. Five microliters of sample was loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel (10 × 10 cm) with 7 m urea and 1× TBE, and electrophoresed with the same buffer for 1.5 h at 200 V. The reaction products were visualized and quantified using a FluorImager 585 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The initial velocities were obtained directly from the initial slopes of the time course plots. The Km and kcat values were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation and the least squares method (28Sakoda M. Hiromi K. J. Biochem. 1976; 80: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cleavage Position and Recognition Sites of Substrates—To determine of cleavage positions in each substrate, a 12% polyacrylamide gel (35 cm × 42.5 cm) containing 7 m urea and 1×TBE was used, and the electrophoresis was performed for 2 h at 3000 V. The size markers of oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′ terminus with FAM and designed to have the same sequence as the products. The enzyme amounts of WT and alanine mutants were from 0.1 to 100 ng, and the substrate amounts were from 3 to 5 pmol. The reaction time was from 5 to 10 min. The other reaction conditions were the same as for the kinetics analysis. The measurement of the recognition sites was performed using substrates substituted with 2′-O-methyl at the 2′ position in the deoxyribose. The oligonucleotides having deoxyribose substituted with 2′-O-methyl at each position and labeled at the 5′ terminus with FAM was annealed to each oligonucleotide to make the substrates as described above. The relative activity of WT enzyme was determined using nick and 5′-recess-end substrates. The enzyme and substrate amounts were 10 ng and 3 pmol, respectively. The reaction time was 5 min. The other conditions were the same as for the kinetics analysis. Purification of Mutant Protein—The residues corresponding to Tyr33, Phe35, Phe79, and Phe279 of phFEN-1are conserved among FEN-1s from eukaryotes and archaea, although the residues corresponding to Phe278 are variable within hydrophobic residues as shown below in Fig. 2A. They were located close to the active center as shown in Fig. 2 (B and C). To analyze the function of these aromatic residues, they were replaced with alanine, a hydrophobic residue, and other aromatic residues. Twenty mutant genes were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The expression level of each mutant enzyme in E. coli cells was almost the same as that of the wild type. These mutants were purified using the same procedure as was used for the wild type. The electrophoretic mobility of each mutant protein on SDS-gel was the same as that of the wild type protein. Tyr33, Phe35, Phe79, and Phe278-Phe279 Recognize Nick and 5′ Recess-end Substrates for Exo-activity—The nick and 5′-recessend substrates were used for a kinetic analysis of exo-activity as shown below in Fig. 3. The highly conserved residue Tyr33 is located in the N-terminal region of FEN-1s from eukaryotes and archaea as shown in Fig. 2A. The residue is present close to magnesium ion 1 bound to the catalytic residues (Asp27, Asp80, Glu152, and Glu154) and faces the active center as shown in Fig. 2 (B and C). For the exo-activity against the 5′-recessend substrate, the kcat values of Y33A and Y33L decreased 333-fold and 1180-fold, respectively, compared with that of the wild type enzyme (WT), although the kcat values of Y33F, Y33W, and Y33H were recovered to 20-29% of WT. The Km values of the mutants altered at 33rd position changed slightly compared with that of WT. For the exo-activity against the nick substrate, the kcat values of Y33A and Y33L decreased 53-fold and 134-fold, respectively, compared with that of WT, indicating that the kcat values of Y33A and Y33L for the nick substrate are ∼6 and 9 times higher than those for the 5′-recess-end substrate, respectively, although the only structural difference between the nick and 5′-recess-end substrates is the presence of a upstream strand as shown in Fig. 1. The kcat values of Y33F, Y33W, and Y33H for the nick substrate were recovered to 29-200% of WT. The Km values of the mutants altered at the 33rd position varied moderately, but not significantly, compared with that of WT. These results clearly indicated that Tyr33 could be substituted only with aromatic amino acids to maintain high kcat values for both substrates.Fig. 1The structures of substrates used in this study.

The sequences of all oligonucleotides are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The residue Phe35 is conserved among FEN-1s from eukaryotes and archaea and is located also to magnesium ion 1 like Tyr33 as described above (Fig. 2). The kcat and Km of F35A and F35L showed no significant decrease compared with those of WT, however, the kcat value of F35Y decreased about 17-fold and 24-fold with the nick and 5′-recess-end substrates, respectively. The Km values of F35Y were about 4- and 3-fold higher than those of WT with the nick and 5′-recess-end substrates, respectively. These results suggested that the 35th position preferred hydrophobic residues to polar residues, because the hydroxyl group of tyrosine showed inhibitory effects on both binding and catalysis for these substrates. The conserved Phe79 residue is adjacent to a catalytic residue, Asp80, as shown in Fig. 2 (A and B). For the 5′-recess-end substrate, the kcat value of F79A decreased 71-fold compared with that of WT, and the kcat value of F79Lwas restored to 20% of the WT value as shown in Fig. 3. For the nick substrate, the kcat value of F79A decreased 25-fold compared with that of WT, and the kcat value of F79Lwas restored to 20% of that of WT. The kcat values of F79Y and F79W for both substrates were restored to almost the same level as those of WT. The kcat value of F79H for the 5′-recess-end substrate was decreased to ∼50% of the WT value, and the kcat value of F79H for the nick substrate was seven times lower than that of WT. The Km value of F79H for the 5′-recess-end substrate was 13-fold higher than that of WT, whereas the Km value of F79H for the nick substrate was ∼2 times higher than that of WT. The charged imidazole group of histidine inhibited the catalytic activity. These results suggested that the function of Phe79 could be satisfied only by non-charged aromatic residues. The aromatic cluster Phe278-Phe279 is located in the vicinity of magnesium ion 2 according to the molecular structure of phFEN-1 (Fig. 2C). Phe279 is conserved among FEN-1s from eukaryotes and archaea, although Phe278 is variable within hydrophobic residues as shown in Fig. 2A. The kcat value of F278Y/F279Y was restored to around 70% of that of WT with both substrates, whereas the kcat values of F278A/F279A, F278L/F279L, and F278W/F279W were decreased ∼10-20% with both substrates as shown in Fig. 3. Notably, the kcat value of F278H/F279H decreased dramatically, 83-fold for the 5′-recess-end substrate and 150-fold for the nick substrate compared with those of WT. For both substrates, the Km values of F278L/F279L, F278Y/F279Y, and F278W/F279W were lower than those of WT, although the Km value of F278A/F279A was severalfold higher than that of WT. The Km value of F278H/F279H for the 5′-recess-end substrate was elevated 5 times compared with that of WT, whereas for the nick substrate the Km value of F278H/F279H was 60% that of WT. These results indicated that both Phe278 and Phe279 could be substituted by tyrosine but not by histidine. The Residues Tyr33, Phe35, and Phe79 and the Aromatic Cluster Phe278-Phe279 Make Minor Contributions to the Recognition of the Double-flap Substrate, but Major Contributions to That of the Flap and Pseudo-Y Substrate for Endo-activity—The double flap substrate shown in Fig. 1 was used to determine the kinetic parameters for endo-activity. As summarized in Fig. 3, the Km value of Y33L, F79A, and F278H/F279H increased 4-, 7-, and 4-fold, respectively, and their kcat/Km values decreased 5-, 6-, and 14-fold, respectively, compared with that of WT. As mentioned above, in the hydrolysis of both the 5′-recess-end and nick substrates, Y33L, F79A, and F278H/F279H represent the mutants with the most severely affected kcat/Km values, decreased 2353-, 58-, and 454-fold for the 5′-recess-end substrate, and 270-, 75-, and 80-fold for the nick substrate, respectively, compared with that of WT. Hence, the small reduction rates of the mutants, Y33L, F79A, and F278H/F279H for the kcat/Km values against the double flap substrate indicated that the residues Tyr33, Phe35, and Phe79, and the aromatic cluster Phe278-Phe279 made minor contributions to recognizing the double-flap substrate. Furthermore, to investigate the function of Tyr33, Phe79, and Phe278-Phe279 in the endo-type hydrolysis, the kinetic parameters of mutants were determined using the single flap and pseudo-Y substrates without the 3′ projection of the upstream strand (Fig. 1). The results are summarized in Fig. 4. The kcat of Y33A and Y33L for the single flap substrate decreased 30- and 433-fold, respectively, and the kcat of Y33A and Y33L for the pseudo-Y substrate decreased 485- and 3233-fold, respectively, compared with that of WT, although the kcat values of Y33F for the single flap and pseudo-Y substrates were restored to 38 and 20% of the value of WT, respectively. However, the Km values of Y33A, Y33L, and Y33F for both the single flap and pseudo-Y substrates were 18-200% of the WT value. The Km of the mutants altered at the 33rd position varied moderately, but not significantly, compared with that of WT. These high reduction rates for the kcat values of endo-activity against both the single flap and pseudo-Y substrates were similar to those for the recess-end and nick substrates for exo-activity. These results clearly indicated that Tyr33 could be substituted with an aromatic residue to maintain high kcat values in both exo- and endo-type reactions. For the single flap and pseudo-Y substrates, the kcat of F79A decreased 31- and 37-fold, respectively, compared with that of WT, and the kcat of F79L decreased to 17 and 7% as shown in Fig. 4. The kcat values of F79Y for both substrates were restored to almost the same level as those of WT. The Km of F79L and F79Y for the two substrates was varied moderately, but not significantly, compared with that of WT, whereas the Km value of F79A for the substrates was ∼3-4 times higher than that of WT. These results suggested that the function of Phe79 could be satisfied by an aromatic residue, with high kcat values retained for both exo- and endo-type reactions. For both substrates, the kcat/Km of F278A/F279A decreased ∼20-fold, compared with that of WT, whereas the kcat/Km of F278L/F279L recovered to around 15% of the value for WT. On the other hand, the kcat/Km values of F278Y/F279Y were similar to those of WT, suggesting that the cluster Phe278-Phe279 could be replaced with tyrosine to maintain the high kcat values in both the exo- and endo-type reactions. Tyr33, Phe79, and Phe278-Phe279 Contribute Greatly to Recognizing Substrates without the 3′ Projection of Upstream Strand but Play Minor Roles in Recognizing Substrates with the 3′ Projection of the Upstream Strand—To determine the effects of an expanding upstream strand in the 3′ direction, the nick substrate with the 3′ protrusion of the upstream strand (Fig. 1) was used for a kinetic analysis of the exo-activity. The alanine mutants (Y33A, F79A, and F278A/F279A) were compared with WT. Except for the Km value of F79A, which increased 4-fold compared with that of WT, the Km, kcat, and kcat/Km of these alanine mutants did not show a"
https://openalex.org/W2145218420,"It is well established that selective COX-2 inhibitors exhibit potent effects against progression of select solid tumours. However, their effects on liquid tumours have not been fully established. By taking advantage of murine Friend Disease we have shown a strong antileukemic effect of celecoxib by determining novel in vitro targets. Western blot analyses revealed the expression of COX-2 in a panel of Friend Virus-transformed, splenic-derived primary erythroleukemic blasts and established cell lines generated in our laboratory. We have shown that celecoxib at concentrations as low as 20 microM significantly suppresses proliferation of the selected murine erythroleukemia cell line HB60-5. The greatest proliferative inhibition was seen at 40 microM of celecoxib, resulting in apoptosis. Our results also demonstrate that treatment of the established murine erythroleukemia cell line HB60-5 with celecoxib results in suppression of c-Kit and erythropoietin receptor (Epo-R) phosphorylation resulting in apoptosis, likely through decreased levels of survival factors. However, upon overexpression of c-Kit alone in these cells a significant increase in survival and twofold increase in proliferation in the presence of celecoxib were observed (P < 0.05). Finally, since responsiveness of our murine erythroleukemia cell lines to celecoxib is above the reported physiologically achievable levels in vivo, we have provided in vitro evidence to suggest that reduced sensitivity of erythroleukemic cells to lower doses of celecoxib may be a consequence of the loss of wild-type p53. These findings are pivotal in addressing potential discrepancies associated with sensitivity of murine erythroleukemic cells to celecoxib in vitro versus in vivo."

Successful models assumed a simple form of prediction that depended only on currently available information. In this issue of Neuron, Nakahara and colleagues record from dopamine neurons in alert monkeys and show that the neurons can encode predictions that are not so restricted, taking into account the context of past trends."
