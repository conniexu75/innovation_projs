https://openalex.org/W2013036395,"Metabolic phenotypes are the products of interactions among a variety of factors-dietary, other lifestyle/environmental, gut microbial and genetic. We use a large-scale exploratory analytical approach to investigate metabolic phenotype variation across and within four human populations, based on 1H NMR spectroscopy. Metabolites discriminating across populations are then linked to data for individuals on blood pressure, a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke (leading causes of mortality worldwide). We analyse spectra from two 24-hour urine specimens for each of 4,630 participants from the INTERMAP epidemiological study, involving 17 population samples aged 40-59 in China, Japan, UK and USA. We show that urinary metabolite excretion patterns for East Asian and western population samples, with contrasting diets, diet-related major risk factors, and coronary heart disease/stroke rates, are significantly differentiated (P < 10(-16)), as are Chinese/Japanese metabolic phenotypes, and subgroups with differences in dietary vegetable/animal protein and blood pressure. Among discriminatory metabolites, we quantify four and show association (P < 0.05 to P < 0.0001) of mean 24-hour urinary formate excretion with blood pressure in multiple regression analyses for individuals. Mean 24-hour urinary excretion of alanine (direct) and hippurate (inverse), reflecting diet and gut microbial activities, are also associated with blood pressure of individuals. Metabolic phenotyping applied to high-quality epidemiological data offers the potential to develop an area of aetiopathogenetic knowledge involving discovery of novel biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease risk."

https://openalex.org/W1974611538,"Nearly 30 years ago, Cavalli-Sforza et al. pioneered the use of principal component analysis (PCA) in population genetics and used PCA to produce maps summarizing human genetic variation across continental regions1. They interpreted gradient and wave patterns in these maps as signatures of specific migration events1,2,3. These interpretations have been controversial4,5,6,7, but influential8, and the use of PCA has become widespread in analysis of population genetics data9,10,11,12,13. However, the behavior of PCA for genetic data showing continuous spatial variation, such as might exist within human continental groups, has been less well characterized. Here, we find that gradients and waves observed in Cavalli-Sforza et al.'s maps resemble sinusoidal mathematical artifacts that arise generally when PCA is applied to spatial data, implying that the patterns do not necessarily reflect specific migration events. Our findings aid interpretation of PCA results and suggest how PCA can help correct for continuous population structure in association studies."

Here, we report an assembly line responsible for the biosynthesis of these diverse peptides, now called cyanobactins, both in symbiotic and free-living cyanobacteria. By comparing five new cyanobactin biosynthetic clusters, we produced the prenylated antitumor preclinical candidate trunkamide in Escherichia coli culture using genetic engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2136243038,"Removal of apoptotic cells is critical for the physiological well-being of the organism and defects in corpse removal have been linked to disease states. Genes regulating corpse recognition and internalization have been identified, but few molecules involved in the processing of internalized corpses are known. Through a combination of targeted and unbiased reverse genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans, and studies in mammalian cells, we have identified genes required for maturation of apoptotic-cell-containing phagosomes. We have further ordered these candidates, which include the GTPases RAB-5 and RAB-7 and the HOPS complex, into a coherent linear pathway for the maturation of apoptotic cells within phagosomes. In depth analysis of two additional candidate genes, the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI(3)K) vps-34 (A001762) and dyn-1/dynamin, showed an accumulation of internalized, but undegraded, corpses within abnormal Rab5-negative phagosomes. We ordered these candidates in our pathway, with DYN-1 functioning upstream of VPS-34 in the recruitment and/or retention of RAB-5 to the phagosome. Finally, we have also identified a previously undescribed biochemical complex containing Vps34, dynamin and Rab5(GDP), thus providing a mechanism for Rab5 recruitment to the nascent phagosome."

Regulation of ROS by the tumor suppressor protein ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is critical for preserving the hematopoietic stem cell pool. In this study we demonstrate that the Foxo3 member of the Forkhead Box O (FoxO) family of transcription factors is essential for normal ATM expression. In addition, we show that loss of Foxo3 leads to defects in hematopoietic stem cells, and these defects result from an overaccumulation of ROS. Foxo3 suppression of ROS in hematopoietic stem cells is mediated partly by regulation of ATM expression. We identify ROS-independent modulations of ATM and p16INK4a and ROS-mediated activation of p53/p21CIP1/WAF1/Sdi1 tumor suppressor pathways as major contributors to Foxo3-null hematopoietic stem cells defects. Our studies demonstrate that Foxo3 represses ROS in part via regulation of ATM and that this repression is required for maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell pool.

Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3074) Google Scholar). However, excess accumulation of ROS resulting from defects in ROS scavenging is believed to impact cellular aging and the senescence process (1Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3074) Google Scholar), whereas the ability to withstand oxidative stress has been correlated with enhanced longevity in several species (1Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3074) Google Scholar). In agreement with deleterious effects of ROS, abnormal ROS accumulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including bone marrow failure and disorders with high susceptibilities to malignancies such as ataxia telangiectasia, Fanconi anemia, as well as malignancies of hematopoietic tissues (2Ito K.

Regulation of ROS by ATM is essential for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, because loss of ATM leads to depletion of the hematopoietic stem cell pool and bone marrow failure in old mice in a ROS-dependent manner (2Ito K.

ATM serine/threonine protein kinase is a critical enzyme in the regulation of stress response to DNA damage, specifically double strand DNA break (6Barzilai A. Rotman G. Shiloh Y. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Loss of function mutations in ATM is associated with ataxia telangiectasia that is an autosomal disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration, immunodeficiencies, genomic instability, predisposition to lymphomas and other malignancies, and extreme sensitivity to ionizing radiation (7Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyanage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T. Tagle D. Wynshaw-Boris A.

Although ROS are found accumulated in several cell types and tissues of ataxia telangiectasic patients (8Kamsler A. Daily D. Hochman A. Stern N. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. Barzilai A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1849-1854PubMed Google Scholar) and antioxidant enzymes are either up-regulated or down-regulated in ATM mutant cells, the mechanism of ATM regulation of ROS is not clear (6Barzilai A. Rotman G. Shiloh Y. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 9Peter Y. Rotman G. Lotem J. Elson A. Shiloh Y. Groner Y.

Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO4, and FOXO6 are the human homologs of DAF-16 and belong to the forkhead FoxO family of winged helix transcription factors. Although FOXO6 is predominantly expressed in the brain, FOXO1, FOXO3a, and FOXO4 are ubiquitous. As with DAF-16 in C. elegans, FoxO transcription factors are critical regulators of oxidative stress in mammals (11Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H. Cullen D.E.

Luciano J.P. Brugnara C. Huber T. Ghaffari S. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2133-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). FOXO3a responds to cellular stress (including but not limited to oxidative stress) by inducing cell cycle arrest at G1-S and G2-M checkpoints, repair of damaged DNA, and apoptosis via up-regulation of genes that control these processes (reviewed in Ref. 15Greer E.L. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7410-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). FoxO proteins are negatively regulated by the highly conserved PI 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway (15Greer E.L.

In response to oxidative stress, phosphorylation of FoxO mediated by mammalian sterile 20-like kinase-1 (MST1) (20Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B.

Identification of FoxO at sites of chromosomal translocations in human tumors, including acute myeloid leukemias, suggested a role for these factors in tumorigenesis. Under certain conditions of stress, such as when food is scarce, DAF-16 is activated to promote the dauer formation. We found the characteristics of the dauer that is in “juvenile form, resilient, long lived, and reproductively immature” (10Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar), to resemble in many respects the “quiescent” state of stem cells. Because quiescence is (a) a major characteristic of stem cells, (b) reminiscent of dauer formation, and (c) protected from apoptosis by antioxidant function of FoxO homolog DAF-16, we postulated that the Foxo3 (the mouse homolog of FOXO3a) transcription factor that is the most highly expressed FoxO in the bone marrow (12Marinkovic D. Zhang X. Yalcin S. Luciano J.P. Brugnara C. Huber T. Ghaffari S. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2133-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) may protect mammalian stem cells from oxidative stress. Recently, conflicting data as to the function of Foxo3 in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell activity have been reported (11Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H.

Studies by Tothova et al. (11Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H. Cullen D.E. McDowell E.P. Lazo-Kallanian S. Williams I.R. Sears C. Armstrong S.A. Passegue E. Depinho R.A.

These authors did not find any hematopoietic stem cell abnormalities as a result of loss of Foxo3 alone (11Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H. Cullen D.E. McDowell E.P.

Conversely, Miyamoto et al. (22Miyamoto K. Araki K.Y. Naka K. Arai F. Tabuko K. Yamazaki S. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto T. Ito K. Ohmura M. Chen C. Hosokawa K. Nakauchi H. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Harada M. Motayama N. Suda T. Hirao A. Cell Stem. Cell. 2007; 1: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) found that Foxo3 is essential for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell activity. However, at steady state, these authors did not detect a significant defect of hematopoietic stem cell frequency in young mice (22Miyamoto K. Araki K.Y. Naka K. Arai F. Tabuko K. Yamazaki S. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto T. Ito K. Ohmura M. Chen C. Hosokawa K. Nakauchi H. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Harada M. Motayama N. Suda T. Hirao A. Cell Stem. Cell. 2007; 1: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Here we provide our data showing that Foxo3 is essential for the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell frequency and activity in young mice. We further demonstrate the following: (a) Foxo3 is critical for the regulation of oxidative stress in hematopoietic stem cells, and (b) Foxo3 modulation of oxidative stress mediates Foxo3 regulation of hematopoietic stem cell activity. Our in vivo and ex vivo data demonstrate that loss of Foxo3 results in ROS accumulation that mediates activation of p53/p21CIP1/WAF1/Sdi1 and in alterations of hematopoietic stem cell cycling, specifically exit from quiescence and G2/M arrest. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Foxo3 is required for the expression of ATM gene that is an essential factor for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal. Using genetic loss and gain of function approaches by RNA interference and retroviral transduction of primitive hematopoietic stem cells, we demonstrate that ATM deficiency participates in perturbations of ROS regulation in Foxo3-null hematopoietic stem cells. These novel findings establish Foxo3 as a physiological regulator of oxidative stress in hematopoietic stem cells, demonstrate that Foxo3 modulation of ATM regulates oxidative stress in hematopoietic stem cells, and provide insight into the mechanism of Foxo3 regulation of stem cell cycling. We discuss what we believe is the source of discrepancies between our results and previous reports (11Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H. Cullen D.E. McDowell E.P.

Mice—The generation and genotyping of mice were performed as described previously (23Castrillon D.H. Miao L. Kollipara R. Horner J.W. DePinho R.A. Science. 2003; 301: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Briefly, heterozygotes Foxo3+/- mice (129×FVB/n) were backcrossed to FVB/n (F3), and progenies (that were Cre-) were intercrossed with littermates to generate the experimental cohort (23Castrillon D.H. Miao L. Kollipara R. Horner J.W. DePinho R.A. Science. 2003; 301: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Littermates were used as controls in all experiments. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Cells—Mononuclear cells from blood, spleen, and bone marrow were prepared using lympholyte M (Cederlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). ATM-/- and wild type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated bovine serum. Retroviral Constructs and Plasmids—The full-length human ATM cDNA from pMAT1 (24Lavin M.F. Scott S.P. Kozlov S. Gueven N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 281: 163-178PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted upstream of the IRES in the XhoI site of MSCV-IRES-GFP (MIG) vector to construct MIG-ATM. MIG-Foxo3 was described previously (19Ghaffari S. Jagani Z. Kitidis C. Lodish H.F. Khosravi-Far R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Flow Cytometry and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Isolation—For Lin- Sca-1+ c-kithigh (LSK) cells, total bone marrow cells were preincubated with 5% rat serum, c-Kit-APC, and Sca-1-PE (BD Biosciences) and biotinylated hematopoietic multilineage monoclonal antibody mixture (StemCell Technologies) containing CD5 (lymphocytes), CD11b (leukocytes), CD19 (B cells), CD45R (lymphocytes), 7-4 (neurophils), Ly-6G-Gr-1 (granulocytes), TER119 (erythyroid cells) antibodies to remove mature cells and incubated with PECyc7-streptavidin secondary antibody. In addition to LSK staining, total bone marrow cells were stained with FITC-CD34 and PECyc5-Flk2 antibodies (eBiosciences) to subfractionate the long term and short term HSC (Lin- Sca1+ c-Kithigh CD34-/low Flk2low and Lin- Sca1+ c-Kithigh CD34+ Flk2low), respectively. Cell sorting was performed using Influx (Cytopeia, Inc.) equipped with Spigot software version 53.8. Measurement of Intracellular ROS—An aliquot of cells (5 × 105) first stained for LSK was used for ROS measurement. Cells were resuspended in pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline, 2% FCS and loaded with 5 μm 5-(and 6-)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) incubated in the dark for 20 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The oxidative conversion of 5-(and 6-)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate to its fluorescent product is measured immediately by flow cytometry. In these experiments, bone marrow cells incubated with H2O2 (500 μm) were used as positive controls. Long Term Culture-initiating Cell (LTC-IC) Assay—Long term cultures were initiated with bone marrow cells (1 × 105) cocultured on preestablished S17 stromal feeders in MyeloCult M5300 (StemCell Technologies) containing freshly added hydrocortisone (10-6 m) and carried as described previously (25Lemieux M.E. Rebel V.I. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) (100 μm) was added weekly in specified experiments. Long Term Repopulation Assay—In these experiments Foxo3+/- (CD45.1, H2-Kq+) mice backcrossed onto C57BL6 (CD45.1, H2-Kb+ purchased from NCI, National Institutes of Health) (N5) were used. Wild type littermates were used as controls. Lethally irradiated (12 gray as a split dose) congenic C57BL6-CD45.2 mice (Charles River Laboratory) were reconstituted with intravenous injections of donor total bone marrow cells from 8- to 10-week-old wild type control (CD45.1, 2 × 105 cells) or Foxo3-/- (also CD45.1, 1 × 106 cells) and 2 × 105 competitor bone marrow cells (CD45.2). Reconstitution of donor-derived cells were distinguished from host cells by the expression of CD45.1 versus CD45.2 antigens (BD Biosciences). For the experiment in Fig. 2e, Foxo3+/- (CD45.1) mice backcrossed onto C56BL6 (CD45.1, F10) were used. FACS-sorted 100 Lin- c-kitihigh Sca-1+ CD34- bone marrow cells from wild type and Foxo3-/- mixed with 2 × 105 total bone marrow of congenic C57BL6-CD45.2 were injected into lethally irradiated (12 gray as a split dose) congenic C57BL6-CD45.2. N-Acetyl-l-Cysteine Treatment—Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 mg/kg body weight (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline solution, pH 7.4, every day for the indicated time period. For cultured cells, NAC (100 μm) was used for the indicated time. Retroviral Production and Transduction of Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells—Retroviral supernatants were produced as described previously (26Zhao W. Kitidis C. Fleming M.D. Lodish H.F. Ghaffari S. Blood. 2006; 107: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from WT and Foxo3-/- (8-10 week-old) littermates treated 4 days previously with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (150 mg/kg, Sigma) using lympholyte-M (Cedarlane). Cells were prestimulated for 2 days in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 15% heat-inactivated FCS supplemented with IL-6 (10 ng/ml), IL-3 (6 ng/ml), and stem cell factor (100 ng/ml) (PeproTech EC), after which cells were resuspended in retroviral supernatants (multiplicity of infection of 10) for 2 consecutive days, as described previously (27Kalberer C.P. Pawliuk R. Imren S. Bachelot T. Takekoshi K.J. Fabry M. Eaves C.J. London I.M. Humphries R.K. Leboulch P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5411-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and plated on retronectin-coated dishes in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 15% FCS containing the same factors. Forty eight hours after the initiation, live GFP-positive cells were FACS-sorted and lysed, and total RNA was isolated for gene expression analysis. Cell Cycle Analysis—Mice were injected intravenously with 2 mg of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU). At 19 h post-injection, bone marrow cells were collected, stained for LSK, fixed, and stained with 7-amino-actinomycin D and anti-BrdU antibody (Pharmingen) for analysis. The G0/G1 analysis was performed as described (28Passegue E. Wagers A.J. Giuriato S. Anderson W.C. Weissman I.L. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1599-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and FACS-sorted LSK populations were collected in Hanks' buffered salt solution medium containing 10% FCS, 1 g/liter glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 μg/ml verapamil. Cells were then washed; Hoechst 33342 (20 μg/ml, Invitrogen) was added, and cells were immediately incubated at 37 °C for 45 min after which pyronin Y (1 μg/ml, Sigma) was added. Cells were incubated for another 15 min at 37 °C, washed in cold medium, and resuspended in medium containing 1 μg/ml of propidium iodide. Samples were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences LSRII). RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time (QRT)-PCR—RNA isolation and QRT-PCR were conducted as described (12Marinkovic D. Zhang X. Yalcin S. Luciano J.P. Brugnara C. Huber T. Ghaffari S. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2133-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript (Invitrogen), QRT-PCRs were performed using SYBR ® Green JumpStart™ Taq ReadyMix (Sigma) in duplicate (Light Cycler 2.0, Roche Diagnostics). Gene-specific primers span the intron-exon boundary by Primer Express 2.0 (ABI). Relative quantification was achieved by normalization against endogenous β-actin. For primer sequence, see supplemental Table 1. In NIH 3T3 and MEF experiments, TRIzol (Invitrogen catalog number 15596026) was used for total RNA extraction. Western Blot Analysis—Lineage-negative WT, Foxo3-deficient bone marrow cells or cells transfected with pL-4 plasmid encoding for shRNA targeting Foxo3 and harvested after 96 h (time required for RNA interference effect to take place) were lysed in Laemmli buffer (5 ml of 4× Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4 ml of glycerol, 0.8 g of SDS, 0.4 ml of β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01 g of bromphenol blue), resolved on 6.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were incubated with the indicated antibodies as follows: 1) FOXO3a (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 07-702, 1:200); 2) ATM (GeneTex, GTX70103, 1:500), and 3) JAK2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 06-255, 1:500). Band intensities were quantified by ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluoresence Staining—LSK cells were FACS-sorted and cytospun onto glass slides fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were permeabilized using 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% Triton X-100 and then incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin incubated overnight with the following: 1) anti-FOXO1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 2) anti-FOXO3a (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), 3) active anti-caspase-3 (Promega), or 4) anti-FOXO4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies (1:250 dilution for each). Cells were washed and stained with Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:400). For ATM-phosphoserine 1981 staining, LSK cells were incubated with anti-ATM phosphoserine 1981 mouse monoclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals) 1:500 dilution in 1% goat serum. Cells were washed and stained with Alexa Fluor 594 anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000). Nuclei were stained with Vectashield-DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured using Nikon EclipseE600 microscope and processed with Photoshop software. Data were quantified by Colocalizer Pro.2 software and Overlap coefficient according to Manders et al. (50Manders E.M.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). ATM phosphorylation signal was quantified using Volocity software. ROS-mediated Hematopoietic Stem Cell Deficiency in Foxo3-null Mice—Foxo3 is the most highly expressed FoxO in the bone marrow (12Marinkovic D. Zhang X. Yalcin S. Luciano J.P. Brugnara C. Huber T. Ghaffari S. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2133-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization is often used as a surrogate assay for FoxO activity. Hematopoietic stem cells are highly limited in numbers, and only few cells can be obtained from each mouse (average of 5000 cells from two mice). We analyzed FoxO expression by both QRT-PCR and immunostaining in hematopoietic stem cells. Analysis of FoxO subcellular localization showed that although both Foxo1 and Foxo3 are expressed at similar levels in hematopoietic stem cells (Fig. 1A), Foxo3 is almost entirely nuclear (over 95% nuclear as compared with 40% nuclear for Foxo1, see Fig. 1, B and C) suggesting that Foxo3 is presumably highly active (and is the most active FoxO) in hematopoietic stem cells. Importantly, the expression of Foxo1 was not up-regulated, and its subcellular localization was only increased by 15% in Foxo3-null hematopoietic stem cells (Fig. 1). Foxo4 transcript or protein was barely detectable in hematopoietic stem cell compartment (Fig. 1). These results suggest that Foxo3 is the prevalent active FoxO in hematopoietic stem cells, and Foxo1 or Foxo4 activity does not fully substitute for loss of Foxo3. Thus, to address the potential evolutionary role of FoxO in the regulation of quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells, we focused on Foxo3 and investigated the hematopoietic stem cell compartment in Foxo3-/- mice. We found a significant suppression of Foxo3-deficient hematopoietic stem cell numbers and activity (Fig. 1). In contrast to Miyamoto et al. (22Miyamoto K. Araki K.Y. Naka K. Arai F. Tabuko K.

https://openalex.org/W1983623116,"Transplanted bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) have been reported to fuse with cells of diverse tissues, but the extremely low frequency of fusion has led to the view that such events are biologically insignificant. Nonetheless, in mice with a lethal recessive liver disease (tyrosinaemia), transplantation of wild-type BMDCs restored liver function by cell fusion and prevented death, indicating that cell fusion can have beneficial effects. Here we report that chronic inflammation resulting from severe dermatitis or autoimmune encephalitis leads to robust fusion of BMDCs with Purkinje neurons and formation of hundreds of binucleate heterokaryons per cerebellum, a 10-100-fold higher frequency than previously reported. Single haematopoietic stem-cell transplants showed that the fusogenic cell is from the haematopoietic lineage and parabiosis experiments revealed that fusion can occur without irradiation. Transplantation of rat bone marrow into mice led to activation of dormant rat Purkinje neuron-specific genes in BMDC nuclei after fusion with mouse Purkinje neurons, consistent with nuclear reprogramming. The precise neurological role of these heterokaryons awaits elucidation, but their frequency in brain after inflammation is clearly much higher than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2066409286,"Mast cells (MCs) have recently received recognition as prominent effectors in the regulation of immune cell migration to draining lymph nodes and lymphocyte activation. However, their role in the development of humoral immune responses is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that subcutaneous or nasal administration of small-molecule MC activators with vaccine antigens evokes large increases in antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses. These responses were MC dependent and correlated with increased dendritic cell and lymphocyte recruitment to draining lymph nodes. Nasal instillation of these formulations also evoked antigen-specific secretory IgA and provided protection against anthrax lethal toxin challenge in vitro and against vaccinia virus infection in vivo. Collectively, these results define the MC as an integral sensory arm of the adaptive immune system. Moreover, they highlight MC activators as a new class of vaccine adjuvants, capable of inducing protective antigen-specific immune responses through needle-free routes of administration."

Extensive psychophysical and neurophysiological studies of visual motion and vibrotactile processing show that the firing rate of cortical neurons averaged across 50–500 ms is well correlated with discrimination ability. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons use temporal precision on the order of 1–10 ms to represent speech sounds shifted into the rat hearing range. Neural discrimination was highly correlated with behavioral performance on 11 consonant-discrimination tasks when spike timing was preserved and was not correlated when spike timing was eliminated. This result suggests that spike timing contributes to the auditory cortex representation of consonant sounds."

https://openalex.org/W2094254801,"Protein absorption in the intestine is mediated by proteases and brush-border peptidases together with peptide and amino acid transporters. Neutral amino acids are generated by a variety of aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases and are subsequently taken up by the amino acid transporter B(0)AT1 (SLC6A19), which is mutated in Hartnup disorder. Coexpression of B(0)AT1 together with the brush-border carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in Xenopus laevis oocytes led to a dramatic increase of transporter expression at the oocyte surface. Other members of the SLC6 family were not stimulated by coexpression with ACE2. Addition of a peptide containing a carboxyterminal leucine residue to ACE2- and B(0)AT1-coexpressing oocytes caused inward currents due to Na(+)-leucine cotransport, demonstrating the formation of a metabolic complex. Coexpression of the Hartnup disorder causing mutation B(0)AT1(R240Q) showed reduced interaction with ACE2 and its renal paralogue collectrin. This would result in reduced surface expression in both kidney and intestine, thereby explaining the onset of the disorder in individuals carrying this mutation."

Despite intensive study, the mechanism of action still remains uncertain. In the current study, anti-CD20 mAb-induced calcium signaling was investigated. Previously, we grouped anti-CD20 mAbs into Type I (rituximab-like) and Type II (B1-like) based upon various characteristics such as their ability to induce complement activation and redistribute CD20 into detergent-insoluble membrane domains. Here we show that only Type I mAbs are capable of inducing a calcium flux in B cells and that this is tightly correlated with the expression of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). Inhibitor analysis revealed that the signaling cascade employed by CD20 was strikingly similar to that utilized by the BCR, with inhibitors of Syk, Src, and PI3K, but not EGTA, p38, or ERK1/2, completely ablating calcium flux. Furthermore, binding of Type I but not Type II mAbs caused direct association of CD20 with the BCR as measured by FRET and resulted in the phosphorylation of BCR-specific adaptor proteins BLNK and SLP-76. Crucially, variant Ramos cells lacking BCR expression but with unchanged CD20 expression were completely unable to induce calcium flux following ligation of CD20.

All anti-CD20 mAbs of the appropriate isotype have the ability to promote efficient ADCC with little evidence that any one mAb is better or worse than any other (17Cragg M.S. Asidipour A. O'Brien L.

However, in contrast, they can be separated into two distinct groups: Type I (rituximab, 2F2) and Type II (B1, 11B8), based upon their ability to redistribute CD20 into detergent-insoluble plasma membrane domains, to induce homotypic cellular adhesion, and to evoke CDC (10Cragg M.S.

Furthermore, it appears that such differences also translate into their effects in vivo with Type I mAb, such as rituximab, being more dependent on CDC for their therapeutic activity (19Cragg M.S.

Here we have extended these studies to investigate the relative ability of Type I and II CD20 mAbs to evoke intracellular signals, particularly intracellular calcium flux. Previous work has shown that anti-CD20 mAbs are capable of inducing a range of intracellular signals into target cells (reviewed in Refs. 15Cragg M.S. Walshe C.A. Ivanov A.O. Glennie M.J. Curr. Dir.

This is important because relatively few cell surface receptors are able to induce fluctuation in intracellular calcium, and in the B cell this is mainly restricted to the BCR and its co-receptors. It is perhaps more than coincidence that anti-BCR (anti-idiotype) mAb, like anti-CD20, occupies a unique position in immunotherapy for efficacy in treating follicular lymphoma (23Davis T.A. Maloney D.G. Czerwinski D.K. Liles T.M. Levy R. Blood. 1998; 92: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vuist W.M. Levy R. Maloney D.G.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) perhaps indicating the importance of calcium signaling in delivering therapeutic activity by the mAb. The importance of CD20 in controlling intracellular calcium is known from work showing that transfection of CD20 into a variety of cell lines increases the level of transmembrane calcium conductance, as measured by patch clamp analysis, and also results in higher resting levels of cytosolic calcium (26Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D. Frizzell R.A. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ability of CD20 to regulate calcium appears to be linked to the generation of calcium flux transduced by ligation of the BCR (27Li H. Ayer L.M. Lytton J. Deans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42427-42434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). After BCR ligation, full B cell activation requires sustained elevation of cytoplasmic free calcium, achieved through a combination of its release from intracellular stores and influx of extracellular calcium. Li et al. (27Li H. Ayer L.M. Lytton J. Deans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42427-42434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) recently provided good evidence that CD20 is involved in the latter component, where it acts as a capacitance or store-operated cation (SOC) channel, triggered to open when the intracellular stores are depleted. Although it is possible that CD20 facilitates this capacitance calcium flux via an indirect pathway, there is strong evidence to indicate that CD20 itself forms a component of the SOC channel (reviewed in Ref. 15Cragg M.S. Walshe C.A. Ivanov A.O. Glennie M.J. Curr. Dir. Autoimmunity. 2005; 8: 140-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these data indicate that CD20 acts as a SOC channel involved in BCR signal transduction. In contrast, the situation relating to the calcium flux induced by ligation of CD20 by mAb, such as during immunotherapy, is less clear. Recently, two groups working on this problem have arrived at contrasting conclusions. Although both demonstrate a requirement of Src tyrosine kinases (STK) and raft redistribution in the calcium flux induced after ligation of CD20, one proposes that the calcium flux results from the opening of CD20 as a plasma membrane calcium channel (28Janas E. Priest R. Wilde J.I. White J.H. Malhotra R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2005; 139: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), while the other suggests that the calcium flux operates by release of calcium from intracellular stores (21Unruh T.L. Li H. Mutch C.M. Shariat N. Grigoriou L. Sanyal R. Brown C.B. Deans J.P. Immunology. 2005; 116: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the signaling pathway proposed by the latter (21Unruh T.L. Li H. Mutch C.M. Shariat N. Grigoriou L. Sanyal R. Brown C.B. Deans J.P. Immunology. 2005; 116: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), Lyn kinases become activated after CD20 ligation, resulting in PLCγ2 activation (a known consequence of CD20 ligation (29Deans J.P. Schieven G.L. Shu G.L. Valentine M.A. Gilliland L.A. Aruffo A. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4494-4504PubMed Google Scholar)), generation of IP3, and opening of IP3-sensitive ER calcium stores. A similar pivotal role of STK in inducing calcium flux and apoptosis was suggested by earlier reports (30Hofmeister J.K. Cooney D. Coggeshall K.M. Blood Cells, Mol. Dis. 2000; 26: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 31Shan D. Ledbetter J.A. Press O.W. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2000; 48: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). It should be noted that in all of the experiments detailed above, the anti-CD20 mAb was hyper-cross-linked with a second polyclonal Ab to generate a calcium flux. To resolve which model of CD20 calcium flux is correct and to probe more closely how CD20 evokes a calcium flux, we performed a number of new experiments using a range of conditions and different mAbs. These new experiments demonstrate that the calcium flux triggered through ligation of anti-CD20 mAb is dependent upon several factors. These include the expression level of CD20, the type of anti-CD20 mAb used, the level of hyper-cross-linking required, and the cell type assessed. Surprisingly, the level of calcium flux induced by anti-CD20 mAb was tightly correlated with the expression level of the BCR and appeared to result from a strikingly similar signaling pathway to that used by the BCR to evoke calcium flux. Furthermore, calcium flux correlated with the ability of the anti-CD20 mAb to induce a direct association of CD20 with the BCR. Finally, Ramos cells manipulated to down-regulate or lose expression of the BCR were unable to induce calcium flux following ligation of CD20. Altogether, these data indicate that CD20 ligation induces a calcium flux through its association with the BCR, rather than through any intrinsic calcium channel capability.

Inhibitors of STK (PP2 or SU6656), p38 (SB203580), ERK (PD98059), PI3K (LY294002), and Syk (Syk inh) were from Calbiochem. Antibodies—The mAbs used have been described previously (18Chan H.T. Hughes D. French R.R. Tutt A.L. Walshe C.A. Teeling J.L. Glennie M.J. Cragg M.S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5480-5489PubMed Google Scholar). B1 and rituximab were kind gifts from Professor T. Illidge (Manchester, UK). Antibodies to pERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), ERK1/2 (Promega), pBLNK, pSLP76 (both BD Biosciences), β-actin (Sigma), anti-pTyr (4G10, Upstate), rabbit F(ab′)2 HRP (Pierce, Perbio Sciences), and mouse Ig-HRP (GE Healthcare, UK) were used in Western blotting or flow cytometry. For BCR hyper-cross-linking, goat anti-human IgM F(ab′)2 (Jackson Immunoresearch), or M15/8 (in-house) was used (32Cragg M.S. Zhang L. French R.R. Glennie M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 1F5 and all other mAbs were produced in-house from hybridoma lines, secreting mAb in tissue culture and purified from culture supernatant using protein A columns (GE Healthcare). The Type II mAb 11B8 (11B8) was produced by cloning the V regions from the 11B8 mAb (Genmab, patent 6737056B1 and described in Ref. 33Teeling J.L. French R.R. Cragg M.S. van den Brakel J. Pluyter M.

A mouse IgG2a (m2a) chimeric form of rituximab (Ritux m2a) was produced in a similar manner, by cloning the V regions of rituximab into the appropriate expression construct containing the m2a Fc regions. The purity of in-house mAb was assessed by electrophoresis (Beckman EP system; Beckman, FL). F(ab′)2 fragments of IgG were produced by standard pepsin digestions (34Glennie M.J. McBride H.M. Worth A.T. Stevenson G.T. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2367-2375PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry for surface binding was essentially as described previously (35Tutt A.L. French R.R. Illidge T.M. Honeychurch J. McBride H.M. Penfold C.A. Fearon D.T. Parkhouse R.M. Klaus G.G. Glennie M.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3176-3185PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic Calcium Flux—Cells were incubated with 10 μm Indo-1-AM with 0.2% pluronic-F127 for 30 min at 37 °C followed by washing and resuspension in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained in the dark at room temperature before use. Samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 min and assessed by flow cytometry using an FL5/FL4 ratio to establish a baseline fluorescence for unstimulated cells. Cells were then stimulated with the desired treatment, and the FL5/FL4 ratio recorded over the next 6–10 min. Samples were analyzed using a FACS Vantage flow cytometer with UV excitation at 365 nm. Data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Analysis—FRET analysis was based on the method described previously (10Cragg M.S. Morgan S.M. Chan H.T. Morgan B.P. Filatov A.V. Johnson P.W. French R.R. Glennie M.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended at 3 × 106 cells/ml in PBS, 0.1% BSA, 1% heat-inactivated mouse and human serum, and equimolar donor (Cy3 or FITC)-conjugated and acceptor (Cy5)-conjugated mAbs were combined and added to the cell suspension (10 μg/ml) for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Each experiment included cells labeled with donor- and acceptor-conjugated mAbs after preincubation with a 20-fold molar excess of unconjugated mAb, and cells labeled with donor- or acceptor-conjugated mAb in the presence of equimolar unlabeled mAb. FRET was assessed using flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with calculations as previously described (10Cragg M.S. Morgan S.M. Chan H.T. Morgan B.P. Filatov A.V. Johnson P.W. French R.R. Glennie M.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). For cholesterol depletion, cells were treated with MCD (10 mm) for 15 min before washing and reconstitution with RPMI, lacking fetal calf serum. Cholesterol repletion was performed by adding cholesterol (12 μg/ml) for 1 h. Western Blotting—For global tyrosine phosphorylation, Ramos cells (2 × 106/ml) were treated with various mAbs (10 μg/ml primary and 50 μg/ml secondary mAbs) at 37 °C for 15 min, and the cells pelleted and lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 200 mm NaCl, Na3VO4, NaF, IAA, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, with 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and incubated with 4G10 (anti-pTyr), followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Assessment of Raft-associated Antigen by Triton X-100 Insolubility—Triton X-100 insolubility assay was performed as detailed previously (10Cragg M.S. Morgan S.M. Chan H.T. Morgan B.P. Filatov A.V. Johnson P.W. French R.R. Glennie M.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml of FITC-conjugated mAb for 15 min at 37 °C, washed in cold PBS, 1% BSA, 20 mm sodium azide, and then the sample was divided in half. One-half was maintained on ice to allow calculation of 100% surface antigen levels, while the other was treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min on ice to determine the proportion of antigens remaining in the insoluble fraction. Cells were then maintained at 4 °C throughout the remainder of the assay, washed once in PBS/BSA/azide, and assessed by flow cytometry as detailed previously. Knockdown of CD20—CD20 expression in cell lines was reduced using small interfering RNA (siRNA) CD20 siRNA: 5′-CCACUCUUCAGGAGGAUGU-3′ (Ambion); 5′-ACGCAAAGCUUCUUCAUGAUU-3′ or 5′-GAGACGAACUUUCCAGAACUU-3′ (Dharmacon); or control siRNA: 5′-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCG-3′ (Ambion) were utilized and transfected by Amaxa Nucleofector™ using solution T and program G16 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa, Germany). The efficiency of knockdown was determined by flow cytometry. Generation of Rx3 and “BCR-low” Ramos Cells—To generate Ramos cells lacking BCR expression (Rx3 cells), Ramos cells were cultured with suboptimal levels of anti-BCR mAb (M15/8, 1 μg/ml). This level of mAb produced a limited amount of cell death, but allowed a subpopulation of cells to survive and grow through. Following recovery, cells were again cultured in the presence of anti-BCR mAb for another two rounds. At the end of this period, the cells were washed and cultured for another 2 weeks without mAb. BCR-low Ramos cells (expressing reduced levels of BCR) were produced by treating the cells in culture for 24 h with anti-Fdμ mAb (XG9, 10 μg/ml) (32Cragg M.S. Zhang L. French R.R. Glennie M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). BCR expression levels were confirmed by staining and flow cytometry for IgM, CD79a, or CD79b. Phosphorylation Analysis of BLNK and SLP-76—Ramos cells were treated for 1, 2, 5, and 15 min with mAb as indicated, and the phosphorylation state of the BCR signaling molecules BLNK and SLP-76 were established utilizing BD Bioscience's phosphospecific antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocols. The samples were then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. Generation of FcγRIIb-expressing Ramos Cells—Cells were transfected with either human FcγRIIb pcDNA3 or empty vector using the Amaxa Nucleofector™ with solution T and program G16 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa). Cell lines stably expressing FcγRIIb were selected with neomycin. Surface expression was determined by staining with the specific anti-FcγRII mAb (AT10) and flow cytometry. Type I but Not Type II Anti-CD20 mAbs Induce Calcium Flux—In our first experiments, we assessed the ability of a range of Type I and II anti-CD20 mAbs to evoke a calcium flux in the follicular lymphoma cell line SU-DHL-4, using the anti-BCR (anti-IgG) mAb SB2H2 as a positive control. These experiments show clearly that Type I (rituximab and 1F5) but not Type II mAbs (B1 and 11B8) induce a calcium flux in SU-DHL-4 cells without the need for hyper-cross-linking with anti-Ab (Fig. 1A). To establish if this was a cell line-specific phenomenon, we repeated these experiments using the well-known Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Ramos. In line with previous observations (21Unruh T.L. Li H. Mutch C.M. Shariat N. Grigoriou L. Sanyal R. Brown C.B. Deans J.P. Immunology. 2005; 116: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Deans J.P. Schieven G.L. Shu G.L.

Dis. 2000; 26: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we found that calcium flux was not evoked in these cells with either Type I or II mAb (Fig. 1B). However, when anti-CD20 mAbs were first bound to the cells and then hyper-cross-linked with anti-Fc reagents, a robust calcium flux was seen, although again only with Type I mAb (Fig. 1B). Importantly, calcium flux was not observed when mAbs to CD52 or MHCII were used, even after hyper-cross-linking, indicating that calcium flux was not simply a consequence of clustering rafts (CD52) or highly expressed cell surface markers (MHCII) (data not shown). Requirement for Hyper-cross-linking Is Dependent on the CD20 Expression Level—In subsequent experiments we assessed a range of other cell lines (Daudi, Raji, BL41, MHH-PREB1, BL60) for their ability to evoke calcium flux through CD20 mAb ligation and found that only SU-DHL-4 cells were capable of calcium flux without the need for hyper-cross-linking (Table 1). To determine the reason for this difference we assessed the CD20 expression level of the various cell lines and revealed that SU-DHL-4 cells expressed ∼3–5 times more CD20 than other B cell lines or normal B cells (Table 1). Therefore, we hypothesized that this high expression level negated the requirement for hyper-cross-linking. To address this suggestion directly, we employed CD20-specific siRNA oligos to knockdown the expression of CD20 in the SU-DHL-4 cells. Using this approach ∼60% knockdown in CD20 surface expression was achieved with specificity demonstrated by the fact that sIgG expression was unaffected (Fig. 2A). Calcium flux was no longer evoked by Type I anti-CD20 mAb in the cells transfected with the CD20 siRNA (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the calcium flux was still evoked in cells transfected with mock siRNA, confirming that the transfection procedure had not caused the lack of calcium flux. Furthermore, hyper-cross-linking of Type I mAb in the CD20 knockdown cells yielded a strong calcium flux, clearly showing that CD20 expression level determines the requirement for hyper-cross-linking to achieve Type I mAb-induced calcium flux (Fig. 2C). (NB: To prevent co-engagement of the BCR and rituximab on these cells (which express IgG as opposed to IgM) a chimeric IgG2a variant of rituximab was used along with anti-mouse IgG cross-linking reagents). These results were confirmed using two additional CD20 siRNA targeting different regions of the CD20 (supplemental Fig. S1 and data not shown).TABLE 1Expression of CD20 and BCR on various B cells and cell lines and correlation of expression with calcium flux generationCell lineExpression of CD20Expression of BCRCalcium flux strengthRituximab aloneRituximab + cross-linkingSU-DHL-4++++++++StrongStrongRamos+++++++NoModerateBL60++++++NoModerate-weakNormal B cells++++++NoModerate-weakRaji (BCR hi)++++NoModerate-weakRaji (BCR med)+++NoWeakRaji (BCR lo)+++/-NoNoARH77+++NoNoNS0-CD20+++++++-NoNo Open table in a new tab Given the observation that the CD20 expression level was critical to the calcium flux, we next used murine NS0 cells expressing a range of levels of human CD20 (36Teeling J.L. Mackus W.J. Wiegman L.J. van den Brakel J.H. Beers S.A. French R.R. van Meerten T. Ebeling S. Vink T. Slootstra J.W. Parren P.W. Glennie M.J. van de Winkel J.G. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and assessed these for the ability to evoke calcium flux after Type I engagement. Surprisingly, none of the transfectants displayed any calcium flux, in the presence or absence of hyper-cross-linking even when the cells expressed CD20 at levels higher than that reached in the SU-DHL-4 cells (Table 1 and data not shown). These data indicate that CD20 expression alone is insufficient for cytosolic calcium flux and support the suggestion that other cofactors required for calcium flux are lacking in the NS0 cells. Requirement for Extracellular Calcium—Recent evidence suggests that CD20 operates as a SOC calcium channel after BCR ligation, allowing entry of extracellular calcium following depletion of intracellular calcium stores (18Chan H.T. Hughes D. French R.R. Tutt A.L. Walshe C.A. Teeling J.L. Glennie M.J. Cragg M.S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5480-5489PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the requirement for extracellular calcium for the calcium flux observed after CD20 ligation, we performed experiments with EGTA in the external medium. As a control, we also assessed the requirement for extracellular calcium during BCR-induced calcium flux. The results shown in Fig. 3 reveal that extracellular calcium chelation had almost no effect on the magnitude or kinetics of the calcium flux induced by CD20 or BCR ligation in either SU-DHL-4 or Ramos cells and indicate that CD20 and BCR mAbs evoke calcium flux predominantly through intracellular calcium release. However, when extracellular calcium was re-introduced (by the addition of CaCl2), later in the assay, a second flux in calcium was observed. These data indicate that a proportion of the total calcium flux observed is due to extracellular calcium influx. This biphasic response is known to occur following BCR ligation, because of intracellular store release of calcium triggering the opening of SOC channels, allowing influx of extracellular calcium. It appears that a similar mechanism accounts for the calcium flux evoked by anti-CD20 mAb. In the case of the BCR, one of the SOC has been shown to be CD20 and so intriguingly the SOC channel opened after anti-CD20 mAb ligation may well be CD20 itself. Taken together, these data indicate that the calcium flux evoked by Type I anti-CD20 mAb results from release of calcium from intracellular stores and precludes a direct channel opening model. Signaling Cascade Required for Calcium Flux—Release of calcium from intracellular stores is usually preceded by signaling activity. We therefore probed the signaling pathway leading to calcium flux"

The crystal structure of the prokaryotic NSS protein, LeuT, was recently solved at high resolution; however, the mechanistic details of regulation of the permeation pathway in this class of proteins remain unknown. Here we combine computational modeling and experimental probing in the dopamine transporter (DAT) to demonstrate the functional importance of a conserved intracellular interaction network. Our data suggest that a salt bridge between Arg-60 in the N terminus close to the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment (TM) 1 and Asp-436 at the cytoplasmic end of TM8 is stabilized by a cation-π interaction between Arg-60 and Tyr-335 at the cytoplasmic end of TM6. Computational probing illustrates how the interactions may determine the flexibility of the permeation pathway, and mutagenesis within the network and results from assays of transport, as well as the state-dependent accessibility of a substituted cysteine in TM3, support the role of this network in regulating access between the substrate binding site and the intracellular milieu. The mechanism that emerges from these findings may be unique to the NSS family, where the local disruption of ionic interactions modulates the transition of the transporter between the outward- and inward-facing conformations.

Upon neuronal stimulation, neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft where they activate both pre- and postsynaptic receptors. The duration of action of the transmitters is tightly controlled by integral membrane transport proteins situated in the presynaptic nerve terminal or on the surface of surrounding glial cells where they mediate rapid sequestering of the transmitters from the synaptic cleft.

(also called Na+/Cl--dependent transporters) constitute the major class of these transport proteins and include the transporters for dopamine (DA), serotonin, norepinephrine, glycine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (1Chen N.H.

NSS proteins operate by coupling transport of Na+ down its concentration gradient with “uphill” transport of substrate. Moreover, NSS proteins are characterized by co-transport of Cl- (5Zomot E. Bendahan A. Quick M. Zhao Y. Javitch J.A. Kanner B.I. Nature. 2007; 449: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Transporters in this family have received particular attention as targets for many drugs including antidepressants, antiepileptics, and psychostimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamines (1Chen N.H. Reith M.E. Quick M.W. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 2Gether U. Andersen P.H. Larsson O.M. Schousboe A. Trends Pharmacol.

Neuron. 2006; 49: 791-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Little is known about the structural dynamics that underlie the function of NSS proteins. Presumably, the transporters follow an alternating access model in which the binding site is alternately exposed to the extracellular (“outward facing” conformation) and intracellular environments (“inward facing” conformation) (6Jardetzky O. Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 7Rudnick G. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2006; 175: 59-73Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is envisioned that binding of substrate together with sodium and chloride to the outward facing conformation elicits a conformational change that shifts the transporter to the inward facing conformation, allowing release of substrate and co-transported ions to the intracellular environment. Notably, such a mechanism implies the existence of two “gates,” one external and one internal, capable of occluding access to the substrate binding site from the extracellular or intracellular environments, respectively. The first insight into the three-dimensional structure of this class of proteins was achieved recently by crystallization of the prokaryotic NSS member, LeuT (8Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 9Zhou Z. Zhen J. Karpowich N.K. Goetz R.M. Law C.J. Reith M.E. Wang D.N. Science. 2007; 317: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 10Singh S.K. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 448: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The structure revealed a conformation likely representing an intermediate between the “outward” and “inward” facing conformations (8Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). At the cytoplasmic side, the structure suggested the existence of a tight network of interactions that might serve as an intracellular gate (Fig. 1). Specifically, an ionic interaction was found between Arg-51.26 in the N terminus close to the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment (TM) 1 and Asp-3698.74 at the cytoplasmic end of TM8 (generic numbers of residues in superscript, see “Experimental Procedures”). This interaction is one of three that are mutually stabilized, including the cation-π interaction between Arg-5 and Tyr-2686.68, and the hydrogen bonding between Arg-5 and Ser2676.67 (Fig. 1 and Ref. 8Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the side chain of Tyr-268 also interacts with Gln-3618.66 and Ile-1874.62, and altogether these residues form the network illustrated in Fig. 1, D and E. The residues in this network are all highly conserved among NSS proteins and thus likely of critical importance for transporter function (Fig. 1 and Ref. 11Beuming T. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1630-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In agreement, prior to the availability of the LeuT structure we had mutated in DAT the tyrosine (Tyr-335 in DAT) and aspartic acid (Asp-436 in DAT), and obtained evidence for a pivotal role of these residues (12Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Loland C.J. Granas C. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3228-3238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); however, we were at that time unable to interpret the data in a relevant structural context. Here, in the context of the recent LeuT structure and a DAT homology model, we perform a detailed analysis of the conserved network in DAT. The experimental work is focused on the putative salt bridge between Arg-60 (Arg-5 in LeuT) and Asp-436 (Asp-369 in LeuT). From a series of single and double mutations, we show evidence that the salt bridge is indeed present also in DAT. Moreover, analysis of dynamic models and computational normal mode analyses of the protein suggests together with experimental efforts that this interaction network is critical for stabilizing the outward facing conformation of the transporter and for regulating conformational transitions in the translocation cycle. Materials—All chemicals were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Indexing of Residues—A generic numbering scheme for amino acid residues in NSS proteins has been proposed to facilitate direct comparison of positions between the individual members of the family (11Beuming T. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1630-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 14Goldberg N.R. Beuming T. Soyer O.S. Goldstein R.A. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 479: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). According to this scheme, the most conserved residue in each transmembrane segment has been given the number 50, and each residue is numbered according to its position relative to this conserved residue. For example, 1.55 indicates a residue in TM1 five residues carboxyl-terminal to the most conserved residue in this TM (Trp1.50). For DAT, the most conserved residues in each transmembrane segment is as follows (generic number being indicated in superscript): TM1, Trp-841.50; TM2, Pro-1122.50; TM3, Tyr-1563.50; TM4, Cys-2434.50; TM5, Pro-2735.50; TM6, Gln-3176.50; TM7, Ser-3667.50; TM8, Phe-4128.50; TM9, Phe-4579.50; TM10, Phe-47810.50; TM11, Pro-52911.50; and TM12, Pro-57312.50.

Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1630-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, we extend the TM index into the immediate conserved loop regions, specifically TM1 to the NH2 terminus, TM6 to IL3, and TM8 to IL4.

All mutations were generated by the QuikChange™ method (adapted from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Expression—COS7 cells were grown as described and transiently transfected with the indicated constructs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (13Loland C.J. Granas C.

Briefly, transfected COS7 cells were plated in either 24-well dishes (105 cells/well) or 12-well dishes (3 × 105 cells/well) coated with polyornithine (Sigma). The uptake assays were carried out 2 days after transfection for 5 min at room temperature in uptake buffer (25 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm l-ascorbic acid, 5 mm d-glucose, and 1 μm of the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor Ro 41-0960 (Sigma), pH 7.4). The indicated non-labeled compounds were added to the cells prior to initiation of uptake by addition of 40 nm [3H]DA. Nonspecific uptake was determined with 1 mm DA. Note that the Zn2+ experiments were done in constructs without the HA tag because introduction of the HA tag mutates His-193, which is one of the key coordinates in DAT Zn2+ binding sites (15Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). [3H]DA Uptake Assay with MTSET Preincubation—Two days after transfection, the cells (3 × 104/well in a 12-well dish) were washed once in 500 μl of uptake buffer. The cells were subsequently incubated with 0.5 mm MTSET ([2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methane thiosulfonate) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada) at room temperature for 10 min. The stock MTSET solution in H2O was freshly prepared and diluted 10-fold directly into a total volume of 500 μl of uptake buffer. After incubation, the cells were washed twice in 500 μl of uptake buffer before initiation of [3H]DA uptake performed as described above. The effect of Zn2+ on MTSET reactivity was investigated by addition of 10 μm of a ZnCl2 solution just before adding MTSET. ELISA for Quantification of Cell Surface Expression—Two days after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After 30 min blocking of the unspecific site with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, anti-HA antibody, coupled to the horseradish peroxidase (80 milliunits/ml, clone 3F10, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), was applied for 30 min at room temperature in the same buffer. After intense washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the antibody was detected and quantified instantaneously by chemiluminescence using Supersignal ELISA femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) and a Wallac Victor2 luminescence counter (PerkinElmer Life Science). All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Data Calculations and Statistical Analysis—Uptake data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 4.02 from GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. The IC50 values used in the estimation of Km were calculated from means of pIC50 values and S.E. interval from pIC50 ± S.E (16Tirion M.M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1996; 77: 1905-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The Ki values were calculated from the IC50 values using the equation, Ki=IC50/(1+(L+Km))(Eq. 1) in which L = concentration of [3H]DA. All values in the figures are provided as mean ± S.E. For comparisons betweens two groups, t test (two-tailed) was performed. LeuT Model Construction and Normal Mode Analysis—The construction and equilibration of a full-length LeuT model in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleol-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid bilayer is described in detail elsewhere. 6L. Shi, M. Quick, Y. Zhao, H. Weinstein, and J. A. Javitch, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the simulation systems with the LeuT molecule immersed in an explicit representation of the water/lipid bilayer/water environment were constructed with VMD (17Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36148) Google Scholar) and equilibrated with nanoscale molecular dynamics (18Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kale L. Schulten K. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (12794) Google Scholar), following a procedure modified from a recent description (19Sotomayor M. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3050-3065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The transporter is imbedded in a membrane patch of 204 1-palmitoyl-2-oleol-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine molecules, 101 on the periplasmic side and 103 on the cytoplasmic side. The entire system includes around 78,000 atoms, with a final dimension around 87 × 87 × 98 Å3. A Tyt1 homology model was constructed with Modeler (20Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10320) Google Scholar) based on the LeuT structure, and equilibrated in the lipid bilayer as described above for LeuT. The conformation shown in supplemental Fig. S1 was obtained at the end of 12 ns of free equilibration. The mutants were constructed with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA) using its backbone-dependent rotamer library (21Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Cohen F.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1661-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Side chain rotamers were chosen to avoid steric clashes with the rest of the transporter model without changes in the backbone. The resulting models are R5A and Y268A of LeuT, which are aligned with the corresponding R60A and Y335A mutations in DAT. We also built R193A of LeuT, a residue facing lipid, as a control. The normal mode analysis within the elastic network model (16Tirion M.M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1996; 77: 1905-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar) was carried out on the ElNemo server (22Suhre K. Sanejouand Y.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W610-W614Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). A Conserved Intracellular Interaction Network—A recent comprehensive sequence alignment (11Beuming T. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1630-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) highlighted a marked conservation in the N terminus/TM1, intracellular loop 3 (IL3), and TM8 of NSS proteins (relevant parts shown in Fig. 1a). The residues include Arg1.26, Ser6.67, Tyr6.68, and Asp8.74 that are conserved among most NSS members (except in Tyt1, see below). In the LeuT structure (8Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar), these residues (Arg-51.26, Ser-2676.67, Tyr-2686.68, and Asp-3698.74) together with Ile-1874.62 and Gln-3618.66 form a local network of interactions, interconnecting the N terminus/TM1 to IL3 and TM8 (Fig. 1, c and d). Notably, this network could coordinate the opening and closing of what can be considered an intracellular “gate” (8Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). The corresponding network in a LeuT-based DAT model involves residues Arg-601.26, Val-2594.62, Ser-3346.67, Tyr-3356.68, and Asp-4368.74 (Fig. 1, b and e). In this model, the Tyr-3356.68 side chain is also stabilized by the carbonyl group of Glu-4288.66 that aligns with Gln-3618.66 in LeuT, but is conserved as a glutamate in most other NSS proteins (Fig. 1, b, d, and e). In the interaction network, an ionic interaction between the arginine (Arg-5 in LeuT, Arg-60 in DAT) and aspartate (Asp-369 in LeuT, Asp-436 in DAT) is of essential importance (Fig. 1, d and e). The salt bridge is complemented by a cation-π interaction of the arginine with the tyrosine (Tyr-268 in LeuT, Tyr-335 in DAT) that requires a specific dihedral angle preference for the arginine side chain and brings IL3 into the network of interactions with the N terminus and TM8. Of note, a similar cation-π interaction is found in the viral protein VP39 (Protein Data Bank code 1V39) (23Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar) where the interaction between arginine and tyrosine generates mutual stabilization of the interaction between arginine and aspartate (24Slutsky M.M. Marsh E.N. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2244-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In a comparative molecular dynamics (MD) study for the known structure of LeuT, we attempted to estimate the stabilizing effect of the cation-π interaction by examining the impact of mutating the tyrosine to alanine (Y268A). In the MD trajectories of wild type (WT), Arg-5 maintained its interaction with Ser-267 and Asp-369 (Fig. 2a, top panel), whereas in Y268A, Arg-5 interacted with either Ser-267 or Asp-369, but not with both, and the entire local network was more mobile (Fig. 2a, bottom panel). This suggests that the cation-π interaction between Tyr-268 and Arg-5 positions Arg-5 in the interaction network to enable its effective interaction with both Ser-267 and Asp-369. In addition, the hydrogen bond between Tyr-268 and Gln-361 within the intracellular network could contribute to stabilizing TM8 relative to the N terminus. Note also that Y268A loses its connection to Gln-361, a residue located only one turn below the substrate binding site, whereas Ala-358 and Ile-359 are in direct contact with substrate. Altogether, this in silico analysis supports the hypothesis that the region is important for substrate release, as destabilization of the cation-π and salt bridge interactions appeared to change the structure and flexibility of the local environment surrounding the substrate binding site. The Role of Arg-60 in the Corresponding Interaction Network in DAT—Previously, we showed in DAT that mutation of Tyr-335 to alanine (Y335A) dramatically reduced transport capacity and lowered the Km value for [3H]dopamine ([3H]DA) transport (12Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The mutation also changed the effect of Zn2+ at the endogenous high-affinity Zn2+ binding site in DAT; whereas binding of Zn2+ to this site causes non-competitive inhibition of transport in the WT DAT, Zn2+ stimulates [3H]DA transport in Y335A (12Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because Zn2+ is likely to stabilize the transporter in its outward facing conformation (13Loland C.J. Granas C. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3228-3238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), this phenotype was proposed to result from a change in the conformational equilibrium in Y335A toward the inward facing conformation; hence, Zn2+ stimulated transport by partially normalizing the equilibrium between the inward and outward facing conformations (13Loland C.J. Granas C. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3228-3238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because the tyrosine (Tyr-335) appears to stabilize the Arg-60/Asp-436 salt bridge via a cation-π interaction, we reasoned that disruption of the salt bridge would produce a similar phenotype as that of Y335A. Accordingly, we mutated Arg-60 to alanine, and for comparison we analyzed in parallel the previously described D436A (13Loland C.J. Granas C. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3228-3238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mutations were made both in the WT DAT background and in a modified DAT containing an HA antibody tag inserted into the second extracellular loop 2. In agreement with previously published results (26Sorkina T. Miranda M. Dionne K.R. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8195-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), this tag did not affect uptake properties of the transporter, i.e. Km and Vmax for [3H]DA uptake in HA-WT was 1.61 μm (S.E. interval 1.34-1.93) and 4310 ± 736 fmol/min/105 cells (n = 8), respectively, versus 1.14 μm (S.E. interval 1.04-1.24) and 3547 ± 177 fmol/min/105 cells (n = 3) for non-tagged WT DAT. Insertion of the extracellular HA tag permitted quantification of DAT surface expression by ELISA; however, introduction of the HA tag removed one of the Zn2+ coordinating residues in the endogenous Zn2+ binding site (His-193) (15Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) making HA-WT insensitive to Zn2+ modification. Consequently, the uptake properties of R60A and D436A (as well as in all following mutations) were characterized in both backgrounds, whereas ELISA was done in the HA-WT background and the Zn2+ assays were done in the non-tagged WT DAT background. In both backgrounds, R60A and D436A were functional but displayed marked decreases in Vmax for [3H]DA uptake, with the larger decrease observed for R60A (values for HA-tagged constructs are listed in Table 1 with the values for the corresponding non-tagged WT DAT constructs listed in the legend). This decrease in Vmax was accompanied by a substantial decrease (10-20-fold) in the Km values for [3H]DA uptake (Table 1). ELISA experiments on R60A and D436A in the HA-DAT background showed that surface expression of the two mutants was similar to that observed for HA-DAT itself (Fig. 3a). Thus, the decrease in Vmax for [3H]DA uptake in R60A and D436A resulted most likely from impaired function rather than impaired surface targeting (Vmax normalized to surface expression shown in Fig. 3b).TABLE 1[3H]DA uptake properties measured in COS7 cells transiently expressing HA-tagged WT DAT (HA-WT) or the indicated HA-tagged mutantsConstructVmax/surface expressionKm for DA% of WT HAμmHA-WT1001.61 (134-1.93)HA-R60A1.23 ± 0.030.08 (0.06-0.10)HA-D436A8.30 ± 0.560.18 (0.14-0.22)HA-R60D1.60 ± 0.090.10 (0.07-0.15)HA-D436R9.13 ± 1.200.24 (0.18-0.31)HA-R60D + D436R2.89 ± 0.440.11 (0.08-0.15)HA-R60D + D436A0.67 ± 0.210.08 (0.04-0.14)HA-E61A88.7 ± 8.521.78 (1.49-2.13)HA-E61A + D436R2.12 ± 0.560.07 (0.05-0.09)HA-E437A45.4 ± 9.240.90 (0.68-1.20)HA-D436A + E437A1.91 ± 0.220.13 (0.10-0.16)HA-R60D + E61R7.10 ± 0.370.06 (0.04-0.09)HA-R60A + E61R8.28 ± 0.760.15 (0.14-0.17) Open table in a new tab The effect of Zn2+ on [3H]DA uptake in R60A and D436A in the Zn2+-sensitive WT DAT background agreed with our prediction in that [3H]DA uptake was markedly enhanced, albeit with a relative larger effect on R60A than on D436A (Fig. 3c). As for Y335A (12Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the effect was maximal with ∼10 μm Zn2+. At higher concentrations, the effect gradually decreased resulting in a bell-shaped dose-response curve. This decrease at high Zn2+ concentrations corresponds most likely to the low affinity phase of the WT DAT inhibition curve and, thus, can be attributed to nonspecific effects of Zn2+ (12Loland C.J.

Altogether, similar phenotypes of the three mutations support the participation of Arg-60 together with Tyr-335 and Asp-436 in the interaction network described above. Charge Reversal of Asp-4368.74 Partially Rescued the Transport Capacity of R60D—To investigate the interaction between Arg-60 and Asp-436 we tested whether reversing the charges at the two loci (R60D + D436R) could lead to at least partial functional rescue. Full rescue would not be expected because the positions of these residues in the interaction network involve them in yet other interactions, so that the repositioned arginine would not benefit from the stabilizing cation-π interaction with Tyr-335 (Fig. 1); however, partial rescue would demonstrate the interdependence of the two residues, consistent with interaction between them. The single mutants, R60D and D436R, like the alanine substitutions of these residues, markedly lowered Km and Vmax values for [3H]DA uptake (Fig. 4a and Table 1). The function of R60D was more impaired than that of D436R, i.e. when corrected for surface expression, Vmax for [3H]DA uptake was 1.6 and 9.1%, respectively, of that observed in HA-DAT (Fig. 4a and Table 1). Note that this difference hints at possible alternative interactions with other residues in the microdomain (see below). The Vmax value for R60D + D435R was also markedly reduced; however, the value (∼2.9% of HA-DAT) was significantly greater than that of R60D but lower than that for D436R (Fig. 4a). This was not observed in the “non-rescuing” mutant (R60D + D436A) in which Vmax was even lower than in"
https://openalex.org/W2044350998,"RNA-binding proteins play a key role in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA stability and translation. We have identified that RBM3, a translation regulatory protein, is significantly upregulated in human tumors, including a stage-dependent increase in colorectal tumors. Forced RBM3 overexpression in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts and SW480 human colon epithelial cells increases cell proliferation and development of compact multicellular spheroids in soft agar suggesting the ability to induce anchorage-independent growth. In contrast, downregulating RBM3 in HCT116 colon cancer cells with specific siRNA decreases cell growth in culture, which was partially overcome when treated with prostaglandin E(2), a product of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 enzyme activity. Knockdown also resulted in the growth arrest of tumor xenografts. We have also identified that RBM3 knockdown increases caspase-mediated apoptosis coupled with nuclear cyclin B1, and phosphorylated Cdc25c, Chk1 and Chk2 kinases, implying that under conditions of RBM3 downregulation, cells undergo mitotic catastrophe. RBM3 enhances COX-2, IL-8 and VEGF mRNA stability and translation. Conversely, RBM3 knockdown results in loss in the translation of these transcripts. These data demonstrate that the RNA stabilizing and translation regulatory protein RBM3 is a novel proto-oncogene that induces transformation when overexpressed and is essential for cells to progress through mitosis."

A defining characteristic of solid tumors is the capacity to divide aggressively and metastasize under conditions of nutrient deprivation and limited oxygen availability. These microenvironmental stresses arise from inadequate perfusion as the primary tumor rapidly outgrows its initial blood supply and from dramatic structural abnormalities of tumor vessels that lead to aberrant microcirculation. Survival pathways are activated within tumor cells to cope with these ambient stresses. Examples include stress pathways that respond to hypoxia (1Welsh S.J. Koh M.Y. Powis G. Semin. Oncol. 2006; 33: 486-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), oxidative stress (2Dairkee S.H. Nicolau M. Sayeed A. Champion S. Ji Y. Moore D.H. Yong B. Meng Z. Jeffrey S.S.

PIM kinases have been shown to promote cell survival in the face of cytokine withdrawal as well as exposure to ionizing radiation and doxorubicin (13Lilly M. Le T. Holland P. Hendrickson S.L.

It is unknown whether PIM kinases participate in induced cytoprotective responses following treatment of cancer cells with chemotherapeutic agents. Since the PIM1 kinase has been implicated in the development or progression of prostate cancer, we have examined its role in cell responses to docetaxel, the primary cytotoxic agent used to treat prostate cancer (27Tannock I.F. de Wit R.

We here present data showing that PIM1 expression is induced by docetaxel treatment. Furthermore, PIM1 is a key component of a survival pathway that includes STAT3 and NFκB transcriptional complexes. Reagents—Docetaxel pharmaceutical grade solution (Sanofi) was diluted in unsupplemented keratinocyte medium (Invitrogen) immediately before each experiment. 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was prepared as stock solutions in PBS. The following monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-β-ACTIN (clone AC-15; Sigma), anti-PIM1 (clone 12H8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-BCLxL (clone H-5; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) (clone 3E2; Cell Signaling), anti-total STAT3 (clone 84; BD Biosciences), anti-GAPDH (clone FL-335; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PRDX5 (Transduction Laboratories), and anti-human cyclin B1 (clone GNS-1; BD Biosciences). Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Clones—RWPE-2 prostate epithelial cell lines (ATCC) were maintained in keratinocyte medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 ng/ml human recombinant EGF, 0.05 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Media-Tech). DU145 prostate cancer cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown in RPMI1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For some experiments, we produced additional pools of prostate cells that overexpressed wild-type or dominant negative PIM1 cDNAs (23Lilly M. Sandholm J. Cooper J.J. Koskinen P.J. Kraft A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4022-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) through retroviral transduction. The coding regions for the human PIM1 gene or a dominant-negative variant (NT81) were cloned into the pLNCX retroviral vector (Clontech). To produce infectious viruses, the GP-293 packaging cell line was co-transfected with retroviral backbone plasmids (pLNCX, pLNCX/PIM1, or pLNCX/NT81) and with pVSV-G, a plasmid that expresses the envelope glycoprotein from vesicular stomatitis virus, using the calcium phosphate method. After 48 h of incubation, the medium was collected, and the virus particles were concentrated by centrifugation. Prostate cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/60-mm plate 16–18 h before infection. Cells were infected with 5 × 104 viral particles/plate in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. After 6 h of incubation, the virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium, and on the next day, 400 μg/ml G418 was added to select stably infected cell populations. After 10 days of selection, stable cell pools were established, and expression of the PIM1 transgenes was verified by Western blot analysis. For reporter gene assays, RWPE-2 cells stably expressing a NFκB-luciferase reporter plasmid were prepared. The parental cell line was co-transfected with the reporter gene plasmid (Stratagene) and a puromycin resistance plasmid. Puromycin-resistant clones were screened for expression of firefly luciferase in response to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor α (Peprotech). Two highly responsive clones were combined to create a pool. In some experiments, this pool of reporter cells was further infected with PIM1-encoding retroviruses, as described above, and further pools were selected by treatment of the cultures with G418. Determination of Cell Viability and Apoptosis—To determine cell survival following docetaxel treatment, both short term (MTT) and long term (regrowth) assays were used. For the former, cells were seeded into 96-well plates (1–2 × 104 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. Docetaxel was added, and the cells were incubated for various periods of time. Metabolically active cells were measured by the MTT assay. For regrowth assays, cells were plated at 5 × 104/well of 12-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Docetaxel was then added for 24 h. Cells were subsequently trypsinized, and dilutions were plated in fresh medium in 24-well plates and allowed to grow for 6–7 days. Cell numbers were then enumerated by crystal violet staining (29Kueng W. Silber E. Eppenberger U. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). To measure caspase activation following docetaxel treatment, the carboxyfluorescein FLICA apoptosis detection kit was used (Immunochemistry Technologies). The stained cells were analyzed with a FACScalibur flow cytometer. DNA Histogram Analysis—After docetaxel treatment for 24 h, the floating and adherent cells were harvested and combined, washed with PBS, and then fixed with cold 70% ethanol and stored at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS and were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 25 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 40 μg/ml RNase A. After incubation for at least 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were then analyzed by FACScalibur flow cytometer using channel FL3. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells (4 × 104/well) were plated in 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells then were untreated or not with docetaxel and incubated for 6 h. The level of luciferase expression was determined in triplicate using a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The luminescent signal was recorded using a plate luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Luciferase activity was normalized to total protein concentrations, as measured by the Bradford method. Western Blotting—Cells (5–7 × 105) were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA supplied with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture Set V (Calbiochem)). The lysates were sonicated and the protein concentration was measured using the BCA™ Protein assay kit (Pierce). Up to 70 μg of total protein/lane were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated overnight in 5% skimmed milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST with primary antibodies (dilution 1:1000) at 4 °C with constant shaking. After washing with TBST, the membranes were exposed to peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes then washed again with TBST. Detection of the protein was performed by using the chemiluminescent SuperSignal West Femto or Pico Maximum Sensitivity substrate (Pierce). Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and single-stranded cDNA was constructed by Superscript III polymerase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers. Real time PCR was performed using iCycler (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Green PCR master mix reagents (Qiagen). The following primers were used: PIM1 forward, 5′-AACTGGTCTTCCTTTTTGGTT-3′; PIM1 reverse, 5′-TACCATGCCAACTGTACACAC-3′; CFL (cofilin) forward, 5′-GAGCAAGAAGGAGGATCTGGT-3′; CFL reverse, 5′-CAATTCATGCTTGATCCCTGT-3′. The PIM1 primer concentration was 2 μm, and the CFL (cofilin) primer concentration was 0.3 μm per reaction. STAT3 Decoy and Mutant Control Decoy Oligonucleotide Treatment—The STAT3 decoy and mutant decoy oligonucleotides utilized previously described sequences (30Leong P.L. Andrews G.A. Johnson D.E. Dyer K.F. Xi S. Mai J.C. Robbins P.D. Gadiparthi S. Burke N.A. Watkins S.F. Grandis J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4138-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). RWPE-2 cells were seeded into 6-well plates (5–7 × 105 cells/well) and allowed to grow. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated with STAT3 decoy oligonucleotide (50 nm) or mutant control oligonucleotide (50 nm) using TransIT®-OligoTransfection Reagent (Mirus). Incubation times of cells with decoy oligonucleotides varied between experiments (see figure legends). siRNA Studies—In some cases (NFκB siRNA studies), cells were transfected with NFKB1 (p50) siRNA, RELA (p65) siRNA, or control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). One day prior to transfection, 5 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transfected with siRNAs using the TransIT-TKO® Transfection Reagent (Mirus) and incubated overnight. The cells were then trypsinized, counted, and plated into 24-well plates (5–7 × 104/well) for luciferase assay, performed 24 h later (48 h after transfection). Alternately, for immunoblot analysis, the cells were plated in 6-well plates, transfected with siRNAs, and lysed after 48 h after transfection. For docetaxel treatment, the cells were seeded into a 96-well plate (1–2 × 104 cell/well, 100-μl total volume) and allowed to adhere for 12 h. They were then transfected with siRNAs using TransIT-TKO® transfection reagent (Mirus). Twenty-four hours later, docetaxel (100 nm) was added to the cells, and incubation continued for 48 h. The MTT assay was then performed. Alternately (PIM1 siRNA studies), specific and control siRNA sequences were cloned into pSILENCER (Ambion) plasmid and used for transfection. The PIM1-targeting sequence was 5′-AACATCCTTATCGACCTCAATCGCG-3′, and the control sequence was 5′-GCCTACCGTCAGGCTATCGCGTATC-3′. Plasmids were transiently transfected into RWPE-2 cells with a Nucleofector device (Amaxa) and incubated for 24 h. Then cells were trypsinized and replated with a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates for immunoblot assay and 2 × 104 cells/well into a 96-well plate for cell viability analysis. The next day, 48 h after transfection, 100 nm docetaxel was applied, and then the cells were incubated for an additional 6 h, lysed, and used for an imunoblotting assay to detect PIM1 knockdown. Alternatively, for the cell survival assay, 100 nm docetaxel was added for 24, 48, or 72 h. The cell viability was measured with an MTT assay. Prostate Cancer Xenografts—Studies were carried out under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocol. Male NCR nu/nu mice were implanted subcutaneously with 106 DU145 cells, and tumors were allowed to form. Tumor-bearing mice (n = 4) were treated with docetaxel (15 mg/kg) or an equal volume of DMSO. Twenty hours later, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were excised and processed for histology and for RNA and protein extraction. Part of the tumor was placed immediately into RNALater solution (Ambion) and stored at –20 °C until RNA extraction with Trizol reagent. Another tumor fragment was minced and ground in cold 1% SDS/Tris, pH 7.5, with protease inhibitors. The proteins were then precipitated with 4 volumes of cold acetone. The pellet was then redissolved in the 1% SDS buffer, and protein concentration was measured. Thirty micrograms was used per gel lane for immunoblot analysis. Docetaxel Increases Expression of PIM1 mRNA and Protein in Prostate Epithelial Cell Lines—To investigate the effect of docetaxel on the expression of the PIM1 kinase, we treated RWPE-2 prostate epithelial cells with pharmacological concentrations of docetaxel that approximate those observed in plasma within 24 h after drug administration. Docetaxel induced expression of the kinase protein by 3 h, with maximum expression between 6 and 12 h, and then a decline to nearly base-line levels thereafter (Fig. 1A). Quantitative analysis of the densitometry data showed that PIM1 expression increased up to 6.25-fold during this interval. The increase was statistically significant at 3, 6, and 9 h and less significant at later time points. Similar results were seen with either 10 nm (data not shown) or 100 nm docetaxel concentrations. To explore whether docetaxel-mediated induction of PIM1 expression was transcriptionally regulated, real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis was used (Fig. 1B). Docetaxel induced up-regulation of the PIM1 transcript level by 2–4-fold in RWPE-2 cells treated with either 10 or 100 nm drug. RWPE cells are immortalized and transformed from normal prostate epithelium. To determine if other human prostate cancer cells showed docetaxel-induced up-regulation of PIM1, we studied DU145 cells in culture and as xenografts in immunodeficient mice (Fig. 2). DU145 cells also showed time-dependent up-regulation of PIM1 protein in response to docetaxel treatment (Fig. 2A). Onset of the response was similar to that seen in RWPE cells. However, elevated levels of PIM1 protein persisted and indeed increased at least to 24 h after drug addition. Mice with DU145 xenografts were also treated with docetaxel or vehicle (DMSO) by intraperitoneal injection (Fig. 2B). Tumors harvested 20 h after drug administration showed a marked increase in PIM1 protein, compared with loading control proteins GAPDH and PRDX5. In addition, real time PCR analysis of tumor RNA showed a significant increase in human PIM1 mRNA in the tissue from drug-treated mice (Fig. 2C). Previous studies suggest that the PIM1 protein increases during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (31Liang H. Hittelman W. Nagarajan L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since docetaxel treatment has been reported to cause G2/M arrest, it was possible that the increase in PIM1 protein that accompanies drug treatment might merely reflect a change in cell cycle distribution. We used DNA histogram analysis to identify changes in cell cycle distributions in RWPE-2 cells after docetaxel treatment (Fig. 3A). There was no overall increase in the G2/M cell population after 24 h of low dose (10 nm) docetaxel treatment, compared with vehicle-treated cells (p = 0.31 for no difference, based on six independent experiments). A large increase in G2/M cells was observed after treatment of RWPE-2 cells with a higher concentration (100 nm) of docetaxel for 24 h. Variable G2/M arrest was confirmed by immunoblotting to detect expression of cyclin B1 (a G2/M phase marker). There was no change in cyclin B1 expression within 24 h after 10 nm docetaxel treatment, but a time-dependent increase of cyclin B1 protein was apparent after 100 nm docetaxel exposure (Fig. 3B, right). During both treatments, however, PIM1 expression increased between 3 and 12 h of exposure, independent of the extent of G2/M arrest and cyclin B1 expression. Endogenous and Enhanced Expression of PIM1 Protects Prostate Epithelial Cells from Docetaxel-induced Cell Death and Apoptosis—To determine whether PIM1 can protect prostate cells from docetaxel-triggered cell death, we infected RWPE-2 and DU145 cells with retroviruses encoding a PIM1 cDNA (pLNCX/PIM1) or an empty retrovirus (pLNCX). Pools of stably transduced cells were selected, treated with docetaxel for up to 72 h, and then analyzed by MTT assay to measure metabolically active cells. Enforced expression of wild-type PIM1 kinase was able to consistently improve survival of RWPE-2 and DU145 cells, as reflected by the MTT assay, at time points up to 72 h after the start of docetaxel exposure (Fig. 4). To determine if ambient levels of PIM1 can protect prostate cells from docetaxel toxicity, we transiently introduced plasmids encoding control and PIM1-specific siRNA sequences into target cells. Control siRNA was unable to block the docetaxel-induced increase in PIM1 expression. In contrast, PIM1 siRNA substantially prevented the increase in kinase expression following drug exposure (Fig. 5, A and C). Down-regulation of endogenous PIM1 kinase expression led to enhanced cell kill up to 72 h after drug application (Fig. 5, B and D). The drug sensitization was statistically significant at every time point. To confirm the protective effect of endogenous PIM1 kinase, we also introduced a dominant negative enzyme (PIM1/NT81) into RWPE-1 and RWPE-2 cells by retroviral transduction. This truncated protein was expressed well (supplemental Fig. 1S). As was seen with the knockdown experiments, the NT81 mutant kinase also sensitized cells to the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel. These experiments clearly demonstrate that ambient levels of PIM1 are protective against docetaxel-induced cell death. Docetaxel has previously been shown to induce cell death in part by apoptosis (32Paoletti A. Giocanti N. Favaudon V. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2403-2415PubMed Google Scholar, 33Morse D.L. Gray H. Payne C.M. Gillies R.J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 34Kramer G. Schwarz S. Hagg M. Havelka A.M. Linder S. Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 94: 1592-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Hernandez-Vargas H. Palacios J. Moreno-Bueno G. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2902-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured caspase activation by a fluorescent caspase activity assay in drug-treated cells as an index of docetaxel cytotoxicity. The wild-type PIM1 kinase decreased drug-induced caspase activation, consistent with its previously demonstrated survival activity (supplemental Fig. 2S). The dominant negative PIM1 kinase markedly enhanced drug-induced caspase activation. The docetaxel effect reflected by the MTT and caspase assays was not great, and its reversal by PIM1 expression, although statistically significant, was still quantitatively modest. These data reflect the fact that docetaxel does not produce massive, immediate apoptotic cell death. To better measure the protective effects of PIM1 kinase on the proliferative potential of docetaxel-treated cancer cells, we used a regrowth assay (Fig. 6). RWPE-2/PIM1 and RWPE-2/NT81 cells were treated with various concentrations of docetaxel for 24 h and then were trypsinized and plated in fresh medium (without drug) and allowed to grow for 6–7 days. Cell growth was then quantified by staining with crystal violet dye. Docetaxel produced dose-dependent inhibition of growth in both cell lines. However, growth inhibition was up to 8-fold greater in the RWPE-2/NT81 cells, particularly at drug concentrations of 5 nm or higher. Thus, the presence of biologically active PIM1 kinase markedly inhibited docetaxel-induced cell death. The STAT3 Transcription Factor Mediates Induction of PIM1 by Docetaxel—To identify mechanisms by which docetaxel could induce PIM1 expression, we examined the activation status of STAT3 and STAT5 transcriptional factors, known mediators of PIM1 transcription, after docetaxel treatment of RWPE-2 cells. STAT5 was not consistently phosphorylated in RWPE-2 cells (data not shown). The level of phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) was strongly and rapidly increased after 10 and 100 nm treatment of RWPE-2 cells (Fig. 7A) (data not shown), whereas the total amount of STAT3 protein was not changed. Docetaxel induced phosphorylation of STAT3 simultaneously with up-regulation of PIM1 expression. These results suggested that docetaxel-induced expression of PIM1 may be dependent of activation of the STAT3 transcriptional factor. To determine if docetaxel induces PIM1 expression in a STAT3-dependent manner, we used double-stranded STAT3 decoy oligonucleotides (30Leong P.L. Andrews G.A. Johnson D.E. Dyer K.F. Xi S. Mai J.C. Robbins P.D. Gadiparthi S. Burke N.A. Watkins S.F. Grandis J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4138-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) to selectively abrogate STAT3 transcriptional activity. RWPE-2 cells were incubated with wild-type or mutant sequence STAT3 decoys for 48 h. PIM1 expression was then analyzed by immunoblotting (supplemental Fig. 3S). STAT3 decoys, but not mutant decoys, decreased PIM1 expression, as well as expression of the known STAT3 target gene BCLxL. These results demonstrate that STAT3 transcriptional activity controlled basal PIM1 gene expression in RWPE-2 prostate cells. STAT3 decoy treatment was not associated with decreased levels of either STAT3 protein or tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. To further define the role of STAT3 transcriptional activity in docetaxel-dependent PIM1 expression, we treated RWPE-2 cells with STAT3 or mutant decoy oligonucleotides for 18 h. Docetaxel was then added for an additional 6 h. As shown (Fig. 7B), the STAT3 decoy did not prevent docetaxel-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 but did inhibit the effect of the drug on PIM1. In contrast, the mutant oligonucleotides had no effect on PIM1 expression. These results identify STAT3 as an upstream mediator through which docetaxel induces expression of the PIM1 kinase. Docetaxel Activates NFκB Transcriptional Activity in a PIM1-dependent Manner—Inhibition of the NFκB transcriptional complex sensitizes prostate cancer cells to paclitaxel (another taxane) and enhances drug-induced apoptosis (36Flynn Jr., V.

https://openalex.org/W1963900982,"Smooth muscle contraction is initiated by a rise in intracellular calcium, leading to activation of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) via calcium/calmodulin (CaM). Activated MLCK then phosphorylates the regulatory myosin light chains, triggering cross-bridge cycling and contraction. Here, we show that MLCK is a substrate of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The phosphorylation site in chicken MLCK was identified by mass spectrometry to be located in the CaM-binding domain at Ser815. Phosphorylation by AMPK desensitized MLCK by increasing the concentration of CaM required for half-maximal activation. In primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle cells, vasoconstrictors activated AMPK in a calcium-dependent manner via CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase-β, a known upstream kinase of AMPK. Indeed, vasoconstrictor-induced AMPK activation was abrogated by the STO-609 CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase-β inhibitor. Myosin light chain phosphorylation was increased under these conditions, suggesting that contraction would be potentiated by ablation of AMPK. Indeed, in aortic rings from mice in which α1, the major catalytic subunit isoform in arterial smooth muscle, had been deleted, KCl- or phenylephrine-induced contraction was increased. The findings suggest that AMPK attenuates contraction by phosphorylating and inactivating MLCK. This might contribute to reduced ATP turnover in the tonic phase of smooth muscle contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2094865786,"Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), an important odontoblast differentiation marker, is necessary for tooth development and mineralization. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) plays a vital role in odontoblast function via diverse signal transduction systems. We hypothesize that BMP2 regulates DSPP gene transcription and thus odontoblast differentiation. Here we report that expression of BMP2 and DSPP is detected during mouse odontogenesis by in situ hybridization assay, and BMP2 up-regulates DSPP mRNA and protein expression as well as DSPP-luciferase promoter activity in mouse preodontoblasts. By sequentially deleting fragments of the mouse DSPP promoter, we show that a BMP2-response element is located between nucleotides –97 and –72. By using antibody and oligonucleotide competition assays in electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that the heterotrimeric transcription factor Y (NF-Y) complex physically interacts with the inverted CCAAT box within the BMP2-response element. BMP2 induces NF-Y accumulation into the nucleus increasing its recruitment to the mouse DSPP promoter in vivo. Furthermore, forced overexpression of NF-Y enhances promoter activity and increases endogenous DSPP protein levels. In contrast, mutations in the NF-Y-binding motif reduce BMP2-induced DSPP transcription. Moreover, inhibiting BMP2 signaling by Noggin, a BMP2 antagonist, results in significant inhibition of DSPP gene expression in preodontoblasts. Taken together, these results indicate that BMP2 mediates DSPP gene expression and odontoblast differentiation via NF-Y signaling during tooth development.

Taken together, these results indicate that BMP2 mediates DSPP gene expression and odontoblast differentiation via NF-Y signaling during tooth development. Tooth development involves sequential and reciprocal interaction between dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The formation of dentin or dentinogenesis originates from the neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells and proceeds in a series of cytodifferentiation stages to form odontoblasts in a specific spatial and temporal pattern originating at the principal cusp tip and advancing toward the base of the tooth (1Thesleff I.

A consequence of odontoblast cytodifferentiation is the expression of specific gene products that form the dentin extracellular matrix.

DSP accounts for 5–8% of the NCPs with high carbohydrate and sialic acid levels, whereas DPP is the principal dentin matrix protein with about 50% of the NCPs. DPP, with high levels of aspartic acid and phosphoserine, is believed to be a nucleator or modulator of function related to dentin mineralization and hydroxyapatite crystal formation (6Linde A.

The DSP domain is found at the NH2 terminus (exons 1–4 and the 5′ region of exon 5), and the DPP sequence is located at the COOH portion (remainder of exon 5). Recently, it has reported that DSPP extracted from porcine teeth consists of three dentin matrix proteins as follows: DSP, DPP, and dentin glycoprotein, which is located between DSP and DPP domains (14Yamakoshi Y.

DSPP is expressed predominantly in odontoblasts and transiently in preameloblasts (4D'Souza R.N. Cavender A. Sunavala G. Alvarez J. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. MacDougall M. J. Bone Miner.

DSPP homologous deficient mice show teeth similar to human DGI-III. These data indicate that DSPP plays a crucial role in tooth development and mineralization, in particular dentinogenesis, and is one of the key markers during odontoblast differentiation. Although an atlas of tooth morphogenesis has been elucidated in great detail (1Thesleff I. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1647-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 2Maas R. Bei M. Crit. Rev.

Differentiation of odontoblasts starts at the bell stage of tooth formation and is regulated by several transcription and growth factors that are expressed by odontoblasts during tooth development (1Thesleff I.

The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are structurally related to the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily and were originally identified by their capacity to induce ectopic bone formation in rodents (21Urist M.R.

Among the BMP family members, BMP2 has been extensively studied for its various biological functions, particularly during chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiations (27Reddi A.H.

During tooth development, BMP2 is initially expressed in the oral epithelial cells at embryonic day 13 (E13), and at later stages of tooth development its expression shifts to the mesenchymal dental papilla and becomes more intense with dentinogenesis (38Aberg T. Wozney J. Thesleff I. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 39Thomadakis G. Ramoshebi L.N. Crooks J. Rueger D.C. Ripamonti U. Eur. J.

Thus, BMP2 is involved in specifying the fate of the dental mesenchymal cells. DSPP expression was observed in odontoblasts at the bell stage and continuously through later stages in mouse teeth by in situ hybridization assay (4D'Souza R.N. Cavender A. Sunavala G. Alvarez J.

Compared with other tissues such as bone, DSPP is highly expressed in odontoblasts, suggesting its important biological functions during odontogenesis. Although bone and dentin have common characteristics and originate from mesenchymal cells, the molecular mechanisms regulating odontoblast differentiation, particularly in the later stages of tooth development, are different from osteoblasts (4D'Souza R.N.

NF-Y (also known as CBF and CP1) is a heterotrimeric transcription factor that binds to the CCAAT motif found in the promoter of many eukaryotic genes (41Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 42Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). NF-Y is composed of three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC. NF-YB and NF-YC core regions are homologous in sequence to the histone-fold motif of histones H2B and H2A, respectively. They are required for heterodimerization, a prerequisite for NF-YA association and CCAAT binding (43Kim I.S. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol.

Although NF-Y was previously considered to be a constitutive transcription factor, recent studies have found that NF-Y is a serum regulatory protein (55Caretti G. Salsi V. Vecchi C. Imbriano C.

Previously, we and others showed that a functional inverted CCAAT motif in the proximal promoter of mouse and rat DSPP genes and mutations of the CCAAT box resulted in a dramatic decline of DSPP transcriptional activity in mouse odontoblast cell lines (54Chen S.

BMP2 treatment increased NF-Y expression and led to localization of NF-Y into the nucleus of mouse preodontoblasts. Nuclear accumulation of NF-Y correlated with enhanced endogenous NF-Y recruitment to DSPP promoter in vivo and increases its transcriptional activity. Forced overexpression of NF-Y up-regulated DSPP promoter activity and induced endogenous DSPP expression levels. This study demonstrates for the first time that BMP2 stimulated DSPP expression in mouse preodontoblasts and committed odontoblast differentiation through NF-Y signaling. Animals and Tissue Preparation—All experimental procedures involving the use of animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. ICR mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratory Animals Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Mouse tissues from different ages were harvested and prepared for in situ hybridization assay and RNA isolation.

BMP2 and Noggin, a BMP2 inhibitor, were purchased fromR&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. CHX was obtained from Sigma. Plasmid DNAs—For all plasmid constructions, standard recombinant DNA technologies were performed as described previously (54Chen S. Unterbrink A. Kadapakkam S. Dong J. Gu T.T. Dickson J. Chuang H.H.

Briefly, the reporter construct p1243, the 5′ to 3′ BglII and HindIII fragment between nt –1,243 and +54 of mouse DSPP gene promoter, was subcloned into the 5′ to 3′ BglII and HindIII sites of pGL-3 basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The p791 was similarly generated from a fragment between nt –791 and +54 containing XhoI and HindIII sites, the p241 from a 295-bp KpnI and HindIII fragment between nt –241 and +54, p97 from a 151-bp BamHI and HindIII fragment between nt –97 and + 54, and p72 from a 126-bp XbaI and HindIII fragment between –72 and +54. All the various plasmids contained part of the exon 1 noncoding region. Mutant plasmid, p97mut, was generated by site-specific mutagenesis of p97 DNA construct as a template using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutant oligonucleotides designated for the individual sites (mutated bases in lowercase) were as follows: 97mut, 5′-CAGGGATCCTAAGCAGaaATacGgTGAGAAAATTAT-3′ and 5′-ATAATTTTCTCAcCgtATttCTGCTTAGGATCCCTG-3′. All corrective constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The cDNAs of NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC subunits were generously provided by Dr. Sankar N. Maity (Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston). For the generation of the expression constructs, the full length of NF-YA cDNA was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and then subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Full-length cDNAs of NF-YB and NF-YC were released with NdeI and XhoI, respectively, and ligated into the NedI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA 3.1 (43Kim I.S. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4003-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient Transfection Assay—For transient transfection studies, wild-type or mutant reporter plasmid or empty pGL-3 basic plasmid was co-transfected with pRL-TR (Promega) into MD10-F2 cells using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Two days post-transfection, the cells were deprived of serum for 12 h, and 100 ng/ml of recombinant BMP2 was added for 12 h prior to harvesting. To inhibit the BMP2 effect, different doses of Noggin (5–20 μg/ml) were added to the serum-free medium prior to addition of BMP2. Luciferase activity was measured as described previously (54Chen S.

For the competition binding reactions, the unlabeled competitor in different fold molar excesses of the labeled probe was included in the reaction. Free and protein-bound DNA complexes were loaded onto a 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris/boric acid/EDTA (TBE) buffer, electrophoresed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Antibody supershift experiments were performed with specific antibodies to NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC subunits (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). This antibody was added to the nuclear extracts 10 min prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. All oligonucleotides used in EMSA were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.

Sreenath T. Kulkarni A.B. Karsenty G. MacDougall M. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 338-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA from MD10-F2 cells and mouse molars at 2, 10, and 13 weeks postnatal was isolated using RNA STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX), treated with DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI), and purified with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). RNA concentration was determined at A260. The cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were performed using standard protocols (66Sambrok J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 8.18-8.46Google Scholar). For detection of each NF-Y subunit and β-actin in MD10-F2 cells and tooth tissues, specific sets of primers were designed for each NF-Y subunit and β-actin as follows: NF-YA, forward 5′-AGTCAGTGGAGGCCAGCTTA-3′ and reverse 5′-ATGATCTGCTGGGTTTGACC-3′; NF-YB, forward 5′-ATCAGGAGAAGCGGAAGAC-3′ and reverse 5′-CCGTGAGCTCTTCGCTTAG-3′; NF-YC, forward 5′-CAAAGCCTCCAGTCCTTCT-3′ and reverse 5′-GGACGACGCTTGTTATCCT-3′; and β-actin, forward 5′-CATCACTATTGGCAACGAGC-3′ and reverse 5′-ACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTTG-3′. The PCRs were performed as follows: 2 min at 94 °C for 1 cycle, 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 58–60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles followed by 7 min at 72 °C. After PCR amplification, 10 μl of PCR products were loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel for electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, viewed under ultraviolet light, and photographed by a graphic image (Alpha Annotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). For quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), amplification reactions were analyzed in real time on an ABI 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green chemistry, and the threshold values were calculated using SDS2 software (Ap"
https://openalex.org/W2034628273,"Paramyxovirinae envelope glycoproteins constitute a premier model to dissect how specific and dynamic interactions in multisubunit membrane protein complexes can control deep-seated conformational rearrangements. However, individual residues that determine reciprocal specificity of the viral attachment and fusion (F) proteins have not been identified. We have developed an assay based on a pair of canine distemper virus (CDV) F proteins (strains Onderstepoort (ODP) and Lederle) that share approximately 95% identity but differ in their ability to form functional complexes with the measles virus (MV) attachment protein (H). Characterization of CDV F chimeras and mutagenesis reveals four residues in CDV F-ODP (positions 164, 219, 233, and 317) required for productive interaction with MV H. Mutating these residues to the Lederle type disrupts triggering of F-ODP by MV H without affecting functionality when co-expressed with CDV H. Co-immunoprecipitation shows a stronger physical interaction of F-ODP than F-Lederle with MV H. Mutagenesis of MV F highlights the MV residues homologous to CDV F residues 233 and 317 as determinants for physical glycoprotein interaction and fusion activity under homotypic conditions. In assay reversal, the introduction of sections of the CDV H stalk into MV H shows a five-residue fragment (residues 110-114) to mediate specificity for CDV F-Lederle. All of the MV H stalk chimeras are surface-expressed, show hemadsorption activity, and trigger MV F. Combining the five-residue H chimera with the CDV F-ODP quadruple mutant partially restores activity, indicating that the residues identified in either glycoprotein contribute interdependently to the formation of functional complexes. Their localization in structural models of F and H suggests that placement in particular of F residue 233 in close proximity to the 110-114 region of H is structurally conceivable."
https://openalex.org/W2013377296,"P21-activated kinases (Paks), a family of serine/threonine kinases, are effectors of the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1. Mammalian Pak1 and Pak homologs in simple eukaryotes are implicated in controlling G(2)/M transition and/or mitosis. Another serine/threonine kinase, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), is an important regulator of mitotic events, such as centrosome maturation, mitotic entry, spindle formation, sister chromatid cohesion and cytokinesis. Plk1 phosphorylation is thought to be one of the critical regulatory events leading to these Plk1-mediated functions. We show here that Pak1 is required for cell proliferation, mitotic progression and Plk1 activity in HeLa cells. Gain or loss of Pak function directly impacted phosphorylation and activity of Plk1. Phosphorylation of Plk1 on Ser 49 is important for metaphase-associated events. Inhibition of Pak activity leads to delay in G(2)/M progression and abnormal spindle formation, mirroring some attributes of Plk1 deregulation. Our results reveal a role for Pak in regulating Plk1 activity and mitotic progression, and connect Pak to the complex protein interaction network enabling cell division."

In this study, we investigated the role of the mitochondrial methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 in the protection against oxidative stress. We report, for the first time, that overexpression of methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 in mitochondria of acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cell line, in which methionine sulfoxide reductase A is missing, markedly protects against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species. The addition of hydrogen peroxide provoked a time-gradual increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species, leading to a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential and to protein carbonyl accumulation, whereas in methionine sulfoxide reductase B2-overexpressing cells, intracellular reactive oxygen species and protein oxidation remained low with the mitochondrial membrane potential highly maintained. Moreover, in these cells, delayed apoptosis was shown by a decrease in the cleavage of the apoptotic marker poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and by the lower percentage of Annexin-V-positive cells in the late and early apoptotic stages. We also provide evidence for the protective mechanism of methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 against protein oxidative damages. Our results emphasize that upon oxidative stress, the overexpression of methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 leads to the preservation of mitochondrial integrity by decreasing the intracellular reactive oxygen species build-up through its scavenging role, hence contributing to cell survival and protein maintenance.

Oxidized protein repair plays a major role in protein maintenance during aging or in certain conditions of oxidative stress (1Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

An important repair system is the Msr (methionine sulfoxide reductase) system, composed of MsrA and MsrB, which can catalyze the reversion of the methionine S-sulfoxide and the methionine R-sulfoxide, respectively, to the reduced form of methionine within proteins (3Grimaud R.

Acta. 2005; 1703: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar), and its reduction by Msr could represent an efficient antioxidant system, since in proteins, the surface-exposed methionine residues can act as scavengers of a variety of oxidants (9Levine R.L.

Perichon M. Friguet B. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and in human fibroblasts submitted to replicative senescence (12Picot C.R. Perichon M. Cintrat J.C. Friguet B. Petropoulos I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 558: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As a consequence, this decline in Msr activity may contribute to the age-associated accumulation of oxidized proteins (13Petropoulos I. Friguet B. Free Radic. Res. 2006; 40: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Although the role of MsrA in cellular protection against oxidative stress is now well documented in bacteria, plants, yeasts, flies, and mammals (14Cabreiro F. Picot C.R. Friguet B. Petropoulos I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1067: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Moskovitz J. Biochim. Biophys.

By contrast, msra null mice exhibit increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and a shortened life span (20Moskovitz J. Bar-Noy S. Williams W.M. Requena J. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12920-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). There are three different mammalian MsrBs, localized in distinct cellular compartments, MsrB1 (a selenoprotein also called SelX in humans) in the cytosol and the nucleus, MsrB2 (previously named hCBS-1 in humans) in the mitochondria, and MsrB3 in the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (21Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The short interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing of each of the three MsrBs in human lens cells resulted in increased oxidative stress-induced cell death (22Marchetti M.A. Pizarro G.O. Sagher D. Deamicis C. Brot N. Hejtmancik J.F. Weissbach H. Kantorow M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 2107-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since the MsrB2 protein is localized in the mitochondria, it would be a key protein for the maintenance of mitochondrial functions due to its antioxidant properties through protein-exposed methionine residue scavenging of ROS. 5The abbreviations and trivial names used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; XTT, sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone; PI, propidium iodide; DHE, dihydroethidium; CT-L, chymotrypsin-like; LLVY-AMC, succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-amidomethylcoumarin; MG132, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; CT-L, chymotrypsin-like. 5The abbreviations and trivial names used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; XTT, sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone; PI, propidium iodide; DHE, dihydroethidium; CT-L, chymotrypsin-like; LLVY-AMC, succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-amidomethylcoumarin; MG132, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; CT-L, chymotrypsin-like. The mitochondrion is, according to the mitochondrial theory of aging, responsible for the generation of cellular ROS (23Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6396) Google Scholar, 24Harman D. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1972; 20: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). The steady-state level generation of ROS, resulting from the electron leaking from the respiratory chain, is properly counterbalanced by the presence of critical scavenging enzymes, providing minimal damage to the mitochondria. However, according to the “vicious cycle” concept, any perturbation to the oxidative phosphorylation process would increase the production of ROS and breakdown of membrane potential, leading to further protein, lipid, and nucleic acid mitochondrial damage (24Harman D. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1972; 20: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to study the role of MsrB2 in cellular protection against oxidative stress. To address this question, we have overexpressed and silenced MsrB2 in human T-lymphocytic leukemia MOLT-4 cells, a cell line that does not express MsrA (5Kuschel L. Hansel A. Schonherr R. Weissbach H. Brot N. Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the role of MsrB2 in resistance to oxidative stress-induced cell death and to oxidant-mediated mitochondrial and protein damage. Although no increased susceptibility to cell death could be evidenced in silencing MsrB2 cells, we have shown that the overexpression of MsrB2 in MOLT-4 cells leads to a protection against H2O2-mediated cell death and mitochondrial damage. Moreover, we have demonstrated that, when overexpressed, MsrB2 can maintain a low level of intracellular ROS, can prevent oxidized protein accumulation and can partly protect the proteasome against oxidative stress-induced inactivation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTransfection of MOLT-4 Cell Line by Human MsrB2 (hCbs-1) cDNA—The human MOLT-4 cell line (ATCC; CRL 1582) (LGC Promochem, Molsheim, France) was stably transfected with the pLXSN retroviral expression vector (BD Biosciences) based on the Moloney murine leukemia virus and Moloney murine sarcoma virus to generate a replication-deficient recombinant retrovirus containing the human MsrB2 cDNA. The oligonucleotide primers flanking the open reading frame (5′-CGGAATTCATGGCGCGGCTCCTCTGGTT-3′) and (5′-GCAGATCTTCAGTGTTTCCTTGGTTTGAACTTCAAAGC-3′) were used in a PCR, and the amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI site of the pLXSN vector. The recombinant pLXSN vector was transfected using the liposome transfection reagent FuGene (Roche Applied Science) into RetroPack PT67 packaging cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. To select stable transfectants, cells were grown in complete medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml Geneticin G418 antibiotics (Invitrogen). The medium from the positive transfected cells was collected, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and diluted 2-fold with fresh medium. The high titer retroviral enriched medium was subsequently used to transduce the MOLT-4 cell line, cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity. Positive and stably transfected MOLT-4 cells were selected in RPMI 1640 complete medium with 200 μg/ml Geneticin G418 and tested for functional protein expression levels by immunoblot and Msr activity analysis.MsrB2 siRNA-targeted Gene Silencing—One micromolar siGENOME ON-TARGETplus MsrB2-directed synthetic siRNA (5′-GGUCAGAGGUUUUGCAUCAUU-3′ and 5′-PUGAUGCAAACCUCUGACCUU-3′) and nonsilencing control siRNA (5′-UCAUCUAGGUCACGUGUUUUU-3′ and 5′-PAAACACGUGACCUAGAUGAUU-3′) obtained from Dharmacon RNA Technologies (Lafayette, CO) were nucleofected into 2 × 106 MOLT-4 cells using the AMAXA basic nucleofection protocol for suspension cell lines (AMAXA AG, Köln, Germany).Cell Culture and Oxidative Stress—Stably transfected MOLT-4 cell lines with either pLXSN/MsrB2 or pLXSN empty vector were propagated in 75-cm3 plastic flasks (Greiner, VWR, Fontenay-sous-Bois, France) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. siRNA-targeted cell lines were cultivated in the same conditions in 6-well plates for 48 h after nucleofection, for an effective suppression of MsrB2. For oxidative stress conditions, cells in exponential growth were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 200 × g and seeded at a density of 1.3 × 106 cells/ml in fresh medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum in 6- or 24-well plates. Control and MsrB2-overexpressing cells were submitted to various concentrations of H2O2 (0, 75, 150, and 225 μm) for 4 h for PARP-1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1) protein expression levels, 12 h for MsrB2 protein expression levels and 24 h for the rest of the experiments. For siRNA experiments, cells were submitted to the following concentrations of H2O2: 0, 75, and 150 μm. MG132 (Sigma) was used at a 90 nm final concentration for cell treatment for 24 h. Experiments using fluorescent probes were performed with RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red.XTT Viability Assay—Cytotoxicity was determined by a colorimetric assay based on the cleavage of the yellow tetrazolium salt XTT (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were harvested from the exponential phase maintenance cultures and dispersed in 96-well plates at a 1.4 × 105 cells/well density. Formation of an orange formazan dye by metabolic active cells was measured using a microplate reader at 450 nm (Fluostar Galaxy, bMG, Stuttgart, Germany). The relative number of viable cells as compared with the nontreated cells was expressed as the percentage of proliferative cells.Analysis of MsrB Transcripts in MOLT-4 Cells—The relative levels of MsrB1 and MsrB2 were estimated in the siRNA control and siRNA MsrB2 cell lines by semiquantitative real time PCR. 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript™ III (Invitrogen) and the cDNA was amplified by real time PCR using primers for MsrB1 (forward, 5′-GCGAGGTTTTCCAGAATCAC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGACACCTTCAAGGCTTCAG-3′) and for MsrB2 (forward, 5′-GCGACAGTCCACTCTTCAGTT-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCAGGTCCATCAGGAAACA-3′). The MsrB2 transcript was amplified for 29 and 32 PCR cycles with an annealing temperature of 65 °C for siRNA control and siRNA MsrB2 cells, respectively. MsrB1 transcripts were amplified for 30 PCR cycles with annealing temperatures of 60 °C. The reactions were performed using LightCycler® FastStart DNA MasterPlus SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Sciences) with an efficiency over 96%. The PCR values were normalized to those produced with primers for the S26 gene.ROS Measurements—After removal of 24-h H2O2 treatment medium, cells were incubated with 10 μm dihydroethidium (DHE) (Molecular Probes) for 45 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For ROS kinetics measurements, control cells were loaded with DHE after harvesting at different H2O2 treatment times. Analysis of 1.5 × 104 individual cells was performed on a FACStarPlus flow cytometer with a 488-nm excitation and a 610-nm emission filter for DHE.Evaluation of Apoptosis and Necrosis by Flow Cytometry— Cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis in control and MsrB2-overexpressing cells after 24 h of H2O2 treatment were determined by FACS using an Annexin-V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After this time period, cells were harvested, and ∼5 × 105 cells were stained with Annexin-V-FITC during a 15-min incubation period at room temperature. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once and then stained with propidium iodide (PI). Analysis of 1.5 × 104 individual cells was performed on a FACStarPlus flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with a 488-nm excitation and a 530-nm filter for Annexin-V-FITC and a 610-nm filter for PI.ΔΨm Measurements—Mitochondrial membrane potential was assayed with the mitoProbe™ JC-1 assay kit for flow cytometry (Molecular Probes). 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) shows a potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, indicated by a fluorescence shift from green to red. The measurements were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, after treatment, cells were gently resuspended in 1 ml of prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 μm final concentration JC-1 probe and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 20 min. As a positive control, nontreated control cells were incubated for 5 min, previous to the addition of JC-1, with 50 μm uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Analysis of 1.5 × 104 individual cells was performed on a FACStarPlus flow cytometer with a 488-nm excitation and 530- and 610-nm emission filters for green and red fluorescence, respectively. Fluorescence imaging was performed in parallel to the FACS analysis. One aliquot of each sample was analyzed on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscopy (Nikon S.A.S, Champigny-sur-Marne, France) with excitation/emission wavelengths of 480 ± 15/535 ± 20 nm for green fluorescence and 535 ± 25/610 ± 30 nm for red fluorescence.Subcellular Fractioning, Immunoblot, and Oxyblot Analysis— Subcellular fractioning was achieved using the mitochondria isolation kit for mammalian cells (Perbio Sciences, Brebières, France) and performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Alternatively, cellular homogenates were obtained using the CelLytic™ M mammalian cell lysis/extraction reagent (Sigma) at 4 °C. The lysed cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g to pellet the cellular debris, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Total proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred onto a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Europe GmbH). Western blotting experiments were performed with anti-actin monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:500 dilution, anti-MsrB2 at a 1:2500 dilution, anti-PARP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:1000 dilution, anti-aconitase at a 1:5000 dilution, anti-20 S proteasome at a 1:2000 dilution, and anti-β5 proteasome subunit (Biomol International, L.P., Exeter, UK) at a 1:1000 dilution. Detection of carbonyl groups was performed with the OxyBlot oxidized protein detection kit (Chemicon International, Ltd., Hampshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2.5 μg of total extract proteins were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to form the carbonyl derivative dinitrophenylhydrazone before SDS-PAGE separation. After transfer onto nitrocellulose, modified proteins were revealed by antidinitrophenol antibodies. Blots were developed with chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Perbio Sciences). Films were scanned, and the amount of signal was quantified by densitometric analysis using ImageMaster 1D software (GE Healthcare Europe).Determination of Msr and Proteasome Activities—Total Msr enzymatic activity was measured in cellular homogenates using N-acetyl-[3H]methionine R,S-sulfoxide substrate (GE Healthcare Europe), as previously described (25Brot N. Werth J. Koster D. Weissbach H. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 122: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Peptidase activities of the proteasome were assayed using fluorogenic peptide, succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-amidomethylcoumarin (LLVY-AMC) (Sigma) for the chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activity, as described previously (26Bulteau A.L. Moreau M. Nizard C. Friguet B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1157-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The mixture, containing 20 μg of crude protein cellular extracts in proteasome buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), was incubated at 37 °C with the substrate LLVY-AMC at 25 μm in a 200-μl final volume. Enzymatic kinetics were conducted in a temperature-controlled microplate fluorimetric reader (Fluostar Galaxy, bMG, Stuttgart, Germany). Excitation/emission wavelengths were 350/440 nm for aminomethylcoumarin. Proteasome activities were determined as the difference between total activity and the remaining activity of the crude extract in the presence of 20 μm proteasome inhibitor MG132.Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Comparisons between control, MsrB2-overexpressing, and silencing cells under the different H2O2 concentration treatments were analyzed with Student's t test and were assumed to be statistically significant if p was ≤0.05.RESULTSOverexpression of MsrB2 in Mitochondria Protects MOLT-4 Cells against H2O2-mediated Death—To assess the role of the mitochondrial Msr in protection against oxidative stress, MsrB2 was stably transfected in MOLT-4 cells by using the retroviral method described under “Experimental Procedures.” Interestingly, the MOLT-4 cell line does not contain MsrA RNA and protein at detectable levels. Moreover, real time quantitative PCR experiments did not show the presence of MsrB3 in MOLT-4 cells (data not shown), indicating that the Msr activity detected in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was most likely due to MsrB2 and MsrB1, respectively. The level of Msr activity was found to be similar in cytosol and mitochondrial fractions of MOLT-4 cells (Fig. 1A). When overexpressed, the MsrB2 protein was essentially targeted to the mitochondria, as shown by Western blot (Fig. 1A), indicating that the human MsrB2 cDNA contains a mitochondrial signal peptide, MARLLWLLRGLTLGTAPRRAVRG, as previously evidenced for the mouse MsrB2 (21Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Msr activity assessed in transfected cells exhibited a 4-fold increase in mitochondria, whereas no increase was detected in the cytosol (Fig. 1A). To study whether oxidative stress can modulate Msr activity in MsrB2-overexpressing MOLT-4 cells as well as in control cells transfected with the empty vector, cells were exposed for 24 h to increasing concentrations of H2O2 (Fig. 1B). In the presence of a low level of oxidant (75 μm H2O2), Msr activity was slightly activated in both cell lines but more significantly in MsrB2-overexpressing cells. At 150 and 225 μm H2O2 treatment, Msr activity was decreased but was maintained at a very high level in MsrB2-overexpressing cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 1B, top), whereas the MsrB2 protein level followed the same trend (Fig. 1B, bottom). To analyze the role of MsrB2 in cellular protection against cell death induced by H2O2, cell survival was assayed by the XTT test in MsrB2-overexpressing and control MOLT-4 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, MsrB2-overexpressing cells were more resistant to H2O2 treatment for all of the tested concentrations. Maximum protection conferred by overexpressing MsrB2 was on the order of 30% and observed when both cell types were treated with 150 μm H2O2.MsrB2 Silencing Does Not Affect Sensitivity of MOLT-4 Cells to H2O2-mediated Cell Death—We have shown that the overexpression of mitochondrial MsrB2 protects MOLT-4 cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress. To further evaluate the role of MsrB2 in this protection, an MsrB2-deficient cell line was established by RNA silencing (small interfering RNA) technology. siRNA-mediated transient gene silencing of MsrB2 results in a significant decrease in the protein expression levels of MsrB2 when compared with the nonsilencing siRNA control cell line 48 h after transfection (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, although the levels of MsrB2 protein were heavily reduced in the siRNA MsrB2 cells compared with the control ones, the levels of Msr activity remained almost unchanged (Fig. 2B). Therefore, in order to check for a possible Msr activity compensatory mechanism by any other Msr enzyme, we measured the transcription levels of MsrB1, the only known Msr present in this cell line besides MsrB2. No differences were observed for MsrB1 at the transcription level when comparing both siRNA cell lines (Fig. 2C). Moreover, MsrB2 depletion did not result in a significant change in the cellular protective response of siRNA MsrB2 cells compared with siRNA control cells in both basal and H2O2-induced oxidative stress conditions, as evaluated by the XTT test (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2MsrB2 silencing and induction of cell death by H2O2 treatment.A, MOLT-4 cells were transfected with 1 μm of siRNA negative control (siRNA control) or MsrB2 targeting siRNA (siRNA MsrB2). Cell lysates collected 48 h after transfection were blotted with anti-MsrB2. Immunodetection of actin was used as loading control. Immunoblots are representative of n = 3 independent experiments.

As measured by FACS at different time points, H2O2 induced a massive increase in ROS within the first hours of treatment in the 225 μm H2O2-treated control cells and reached a plateau at 9 h (Fig. 3A). To evaluate whether MsrB2, as has been previously demonstrated for MsrA (17Yermolaieva O. Xu R. Schinstock C. Brot N. Weissbach H. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, the basal level of superoxide is slightly but significantly lower in MsrB2-overexpressing cells, and this level remains smaller when assayed 24 h after treatment of the cells with increasing concentrations of H2O2 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, no differences in ROS modulation were observed between the siRNA MsrB2 cell line and the siRNA control cell line (Fig. 3C).

https://openalex.org/W2075930190,"Induction of specific gene expression patterns in response to activity confers functional plasticity to neurons. A principal role in the regulation of these processes has been ascribed to the cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). Using genome-wide expression profiling in mice lacking CREB in the forebrain, accompanied by deletion of the cAMP responsive element modulator gene (CREM), we here show that the role of these proteins in activity-induced gene expression is surprisingly selective and highly context dependent. Thus, only a very restricted subset of activity-induced genes (i.e., Gadd45b or Nr4a2) requires these proteins for their induction in the hippocampus after kainic acid administration, while they are required for most of the cocaine-induced expression changes in the striatum. Interestingly, in the absence of CREB, CREM is able to rescue activity-regulated transcription, which strengthens the notion of overlapping functions of the two proteins. In addition, we show that cholesterol metabolism is dysregulated in the brains of mutant mice, as reflected coordinated expression changes in genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and neuronal accumulation of cholesterol. These findings provide novel insights into the role of CREB and CREM in stimulus-dependent transcription and neuronal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1969088267,"The oxidative stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been analyzed by parallel determination of mRNA levels and transcription rates for the entire genome. A mathematical algorithm has been adapted for a dynamic situation such as the response to stress, to calculate theoretical mRNA decay rates from the experimental data. Yeast genes have been grouped into 25 clusters according to mRNA level and transcription rate kinetics, and average mRNA decay rates have been calculated for each cluster. In most of the genes, changes in one or both experimentally determined parameters occur during the stress response. 24% of the genes are transcriptionally induced without an increase in mRNA levels. The lack of parallelism between the evolution of the mRNA amount and transcription rate predicts changes in mRNA stability during stress. Genes for ribosomal proteins and rRNA processing enzymes are abundant among those whose mRNAs are predicted to destabilize. The number of genes whose mRNAs are predicted to stabilize is lower, although some protein folding or proteasomal genes are among the latter. We have confirmed the mathematical predictions for several genes pertaining to different clusters by experimentally determining mRNA decay rates using the regulatable tetO promoter in transcriptional expression conditions not affected by the oxidative stress. This study indicates that the oxidative stress response in yeast cells is not only conditioned by gene transcription but also by the mRNA decay dynamics and that this complex response may be particularly relevant to explain the temporary down-regulation of protein synthesis occurring during stress.

This study indicates that the oxidative stress response in yeast cells is not only conditioned by gene transcription but also by the mRNA decay dynamics and that this complex response may be particularly relevant to explain the temporary down-regulation of protein synthesis occurring during stress. Cells react against environmental stresses through multiple responses that occur at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels to adapt themselves to the new conditions and counteract the possible macromolecular damage caused by the stress situation. Most systematic studies on such responses focus on changes in mRNA amounts (mRNA amount or concentration (i.e. amount per cell), indicated as RA) caused by the environmental stress, using the DNA array technology. In the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcriptome analyses have been reported for a number of stresses including oxidative, osmotic, and nutritional ones in addition to heat shock (1Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3761) Google Scholar, 2Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S.

Levels of a particular mRNA at a given time are the result of a balance between transcription rate (TR) 4The abbreviations used are: TR, transcription rate; pol I, RNA polymerase I; pol II, RNA polymerase II; GRO, genomic run-on; UTR, untranslated region; t-BOOH, ter-butyl hydroperoxide; RP, ribosomal proteins; GO, Gene Ontology. and decay rate (commonly expressed as a half-life, or as a first-order kinetic constant of degradation, kD) (3Pérez-Ortín J.E. Alepuz P.M. Moreno J. Trends Genet. 2007; 23: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is usually assumed that TR driven by specific transcriptional regulators plays the major role in the stress response. However, decay rate may change after the onset of an environmental stress and, in that instance, profiles of individual mRNAs may not directly reflect the corresponding TR profiles. We have developed a genomic run-on (GRO) methodology that allows quantifying TR and RA for each individual gene at a genomic scale (4García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, mRNA half-lives can be obtained from TR and RA data under steady-state conditions. When applied to a nutritional shift from glucose to galactose, the GRO methodology showed that TR was the main determinant of RA, although some groups of genes were modulated at the mRNA decay level (4García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). More recently, we have developed a mathematical algorithm to determine mRNA half-life values from pointwise measurements of TR and RA in dynamic situations after the onset of an environmental stress when steady-state conditions cannot be assumed (3Pérez-Ortín J.E. Alepuz P.M. Moreno J. Trends Genet. 2007; 23: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Other groups have applied nuclear run-on approaches to culture cells. Fan et al. (5Fan J. Yang X. Wang W. Wood III, W.H. Becker K.G. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) determined RA and TR levels in human H1299 cells for about 1000 genes under non-stress and stress conditions, from which they inferred information on mRNA decay as well. Tennebaum et al. (6Tenenbaum S.A. Carson C.C. Atasoy U. Keene J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 317: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) developed the protocol “en masse run-on assay” in which the run-on profiling is combined with ribonomic profiling. Ribonomics is a term that defines the use of immunoprecipitated mRNP complexes to analyze the representation of individual mRNA species associated with a particular RNA-binding protein. The analyses of both kinds of data have led to the proposal that “post-transcriptional operons” (7Keene J.D. Tenenbaum S.A. Mol.

Two general mechanisms operate in S. cerevisiae: deadenylation of the 3′-poly(A) tail followed by 3′–5′ degradation of the mRNA by the exonucleolytic activity of the exosome or initial removal of the poly(A) tail followed by mRNA hydrolysis by the 5′–3′-exonuclease Xrn1. S. cerevisiae is the first eukaryotic organism in which whole-genome studies have been done on mRNA stability in steady-state exponential growth conditions during glucose fermentation. In a first study (8Wang Y. Liu C.L. Storey J.D. Tibshirami R.J. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), a temperature-sensitive RNA polymerase II (pol II) mutant was employed to switch off transcription and follow up mRNA levels at successive times for each transcript. In a second study (15Grigull J. Mnaimneh S. Pootoolal J. Robinson M.D. Hughes T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5534-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), several chemical inhibitors of transcription were employed for the same purpose. Both studies showed that mRNA half-lives varied between a few minutes and more than 1 h and that mRNAs for proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing were relatively unstable. A general correlation was also found between mRNA decay rates and the physiological function of the gene products (8Wang Y. Liu C.L. Storey J.D. Tibshirami R.J. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). However, the experimental conditions employed for switching off transcription in the above studies caused a stress situation per se in yeast cells, which discards using a similar approach for analyzing mRNA kinetics after an experimentally induced stress (16Pérez-Ortín J.E. Brief. Funct. Genomics Proteomics. 2008; 6: 282-291Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress by external agents causes a transcriptional response in S. cerevisiae that involves a large number of genes (1Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3761) Google Scholar), with the participation of the general stress response factor Msn2/4p and the oxidative stress-specific transcription factors Yap1 and Skn7 (17Toledano M.B. Delaunay A. Biteau B. Spector D. Azevedo D. Hohmann S. Mager P.W.H. Topics in Current Genetics. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2003: 241-303Google Scholar). Exposure of yeast cells to hydrogen peroxide results in increased levels of antioxidant proteins, heat shock proteins, components of the protein degradation machinery, and enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway, which provides NADPH for some of the antioxidant systems (18Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 19Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garín J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In parallel, there is a down-regulation of the protein translation apparatus. This proteome pattern, although limited to about 20% of all expressed proteins in yeast cells, approximately parallels the transcriptome pattern (1Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3761) Google Scholar), which indicates that the oxidative stress response mainly occurs through regulation of mRNA level. However, recent studies demonstrate that inhibition of protein synthesis occurring after an oxidative stress is not only caused by transcriptional down-regulation of the translation machinery but also by inhibition of translation initiation due to dissociation of ribosomes from mRNA and a slower rate of ribosomal runoff along mRNA molecules (20Swaminathan S. Masek T. Molin C. Pospisek M. Sunnerhagen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1472-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Shenton D. Smirnova J.B. Selley J.N. Carroll K. Hubbard S.J. Pavitt G.D. Ashe M.P. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29011-29021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This illustrates the importance of the post-transcriptional level of regulation (22Sunnerhagen P. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2007; 277: 341-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which may also involve the regulation of mRNA translation efficiency by 3′-AU-rich elements, as is the case of the MFA2 mRNA in S. cerevisiae (23Vasudevan S. Garneau N. Khounh D.T. Reltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9753-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The oxidative stress response in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is in part regulated by the stabilization of atf1+ mRNA mediated by the RNA-binding protein Csx1 and Upf1 (24Rodríguez-Gabriel M.A. Burns G. McDonald W.H. Martin V. Yates III, J.R. Bähler J. Russell P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6256-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Rodríguez-Gabriel M.A. Watt S. Bähler J. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6347-6356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The latter is a component of the nonsense codon-mediated mRNA decay system. Atf1 is a transcription factor that coordinates the expression of many stress response genes and itself is under regulation of the Sty1 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (26Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The above studies in yeast cells leave unanswered the specific role of TR and mRNA decay in establishing new mRNA levels as a response to an oxidative stress. Here, we employ the GRO methodology to measure changes in TR and RA at a whole-genome level at different times after imposing an oxidative stress on yeast cells, and then we infer the evolution of mRNA half-lives after such a stress. Messenger RNA decay rates are validated for some genes whose expression becomes driven by the doxycycline-regulated tet promoter (27Bellí G. Garí E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 28Bellí G. Garí E. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), in conditions that do not cause an additional stress to yeast cells. Results indicate that for some functional groups of genes, changes in mRNA decay rates play an important role in the adaptation to oxidative stress. Strains and Growth Conditions—Wild type S. cerevisiae W303-1A (MATa ura3-1 ade2-1 leu2-3,112 trp-11 his3-11,15) was employed in the GRO experiments. MML830 is a derivative of the above strain by integration of EcoRV-linearized pCM244 (27Bellí G. Garí E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This plasmid codes for the tetR′-Ssn6 protein, which acts as repressor on tetO promoters after activation by doxycycline. The promoter-substitution cassette from plasmid pCM224 was employed for replacing the endogenous promoters of several genes in MML830 by the tetO2 promoter, as described in Ref. 28Bellí G. Garí E. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar. The resulting strains are: MML863 (tetO2-HSP104), MML957 (tetO2-RRP40), MML980 (tetO2-HSP42), and MML990 (tetO2-FIT3). In these strains, the gene expression driven by tetO2 is up-regulated in the absence of doxycycline, whereas the addition of the antibiotic represses it (27Bellí G. Garí E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) at 28 °C. Doxycycline at 5 μg/ml was added for repressing genes under the tetO2 promoter. Oxidative stress conditions were created by the addition of t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) at 0.1 mm. Experiments were initiated on exponential cultures that had been grown in such conditions for at least 10 generations, at concentrations of 1.5–2 × 107 cells/ml. Genomic Run-on—Exponential cultures in 800 ml of YPD medium in 2-liter flasks shaken at 120 rpm were employed. Cell samples were taken at different times: t0 (exponential growth in YPD medium, just before t-BOOH addition), t1, t2, t3, t4, and t5, corresponding to 7, 16, 26, 41, and 71 min, respectively, after the application of the oxidative stress. At every sampling time, two different aliquots were taken. One of them was immediately processed to measure TR, according to the GRO protocol (see below). Cells from the second aliquot were recovered, washed with cold distilled water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until used for mRNA measurement. The GRO protocol described previously (4García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was used with the following modifications. Around 6 × 108 yeast cells were used to perform in vivo transcription. After spinning down cells, they were washed in cold water, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 900 μl of sterile cold water (final volume 950 μl). Then, the cell suspension was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, 50 μl of 10% N-lauryl sarcosine sodium sulfate (sarkosyl) were added, and cells were incubated for 20 min on ice. After the permeabilization step, cells were recovered by low speed centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. In vivo transcription was performed by resuspending cells in 120 μl of 2.5× transcription buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 500 mm KCl, 80 mm MgCl2), 16 μl of AGC mix (10 mm each of CTP, ATP, and GTP), 6 μl of dithiothreitol (0.1 m), and 13 μl of [α-33P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl). Cells were maintained on ice at all times. The final volume was adjusted to 300 μl with distilled water, and the mix was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C to allow transcription elongation. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of cold distilled water to the mix. Cells were recovered by centrifugation to remove the non-incorporated radioactive nucleotide. Total RNA was isolated using the Fast-Prep device (Bio101 Inc.) as described (4García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) except that acid phenol-chloroform (5:1) was used during cell breakage. Total extracted RNA was spectrophotometrically quantified. An aliquot was used for specific radioactivity determination in a scintillation counter. All the in vivo labeled RNA was used for hybridization. Nylon filters made using PCR-amplified whole open reading frame sequences as probes (29Alberola T.M. García-Martínez J. Antúnez O. Viladevall L. Barceló A. Ariño J. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Int. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 199-206PubMed Google Scholar) were used as described (4García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) except that hybridizations were conducted during 40–48 h. Filters were exposed for 5–7 days to an imaging plate (BAS-MP, FujiFilm), which was read in a phosphorimaging scanner (FLA-3000, FujiFilm). Measurement of RNA Levels—As mentioned above, a second cell aliquot was taken at each sampling time and immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. After thawing the samples on ice, total RNA was isolated following the same procedure described for GRO samples except that RNA was precipitated once with 1 volume of 5 m LiCl, washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in distilled water, and reprecipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m NaAcO and 2 volumes of cold 96% ethanol. Again, RNA yield was measured spectrophotometrically. About 30–40 μgof DNA-digested total RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA as described (4García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) but using Invitrogen random hexamers for random priming. Hybridization was done in the same conditions as described for the GRO experiment except that labeled cDNA was at 5 × 106 dpm/ml and that filters were exposed for 1–2 days to an imaging plate. Estimation of Total RNA and mRNA—To facilitate further normalizations, we estimated the RNA amount obtained from a fixed amount of cells along the experiment. Thus, five different cell aliquots were taken at each of the six sampling times (t0–t5) from a mock experiment. Total RNA was extracted, using the same protocol described previously, and quantified. Poly(A) mRNA was estimated using a dot-blot procedure as described (4García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Using these data, we calculated the proportion of poly(A) mRNA per μg of total RNA and, thus, per cell at each of the time points (t0–t5, see Fig. 1). Quantification of Hybridization Signals and Normalization Procedures—A total of six different nylon filters (one for each sampling time) were used. Filter combinations for the different hybridizations and replicates and image quantification were performed as described in Ref. 4García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar. cDNA hybridizations were normalized within each experiment replicate by the global mean procedure. Correction factor to normalize between experiments was calculated from global mean values for the t0 sampling times. Reproducibility of the replicates was tested by the ArrayStat software (Imaging Research, Inc.), considering the data as independent and allowing the program to take a minimum number of valid replicates of 2 to calculate the mean values for every gene (only one of the three replicates is allowed to be a removable outlier). Average cDNA values for each gene were finally corrected by the percentage of guanine residues in each probe-coding strand. Normalization between sampling points was made using the amount of mRNA/cell to give values of mRNA copies/cell for each gene in every time point. These values were used for cluster analysis and comparisons. For normalizing the GRO hybridizations a different strategy was followed. First, we measured the total transcription per cell by using total dpm measured after extraction of the in vivo radioactively labeled RNA. The quantification of the extracted RNA allowed us to estimate the total transcription per cell. For each time point, we estimated TRI (TR of pol I) by summing up the 16 signals from the specific probes (eight for 18 S and eight for 25 S regions) and TRII (TR of pol II) by summing up the whole set of signals (5950 pol II probes) in every hybridization. Since it is known that at t0 (exponential growth in YPD), the ratio between TRI and TRII is about 2 (30Warner J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar) and that the estimated total transcription is, roughly, the sum of the contribution of these two polymerases, it is possible to determine the correction factor that fulfills these conditions. This factor was applied to the polymerase raw ratios for every sampling point. This allowed us to normalize the raw hybridization signals obtained for the RNA pol II probes. Statistical validation of replicates was performed as in cDNA values. After that, average TR values for each gene were finally corrected by the percentage of uracil residues present in each probe-coding strand. Again, the corrected average values were used for gene cluster analysis and other calculations. Northern Blot Studies—RNA electrophoresis, probe labeling with digoxigenin, hybridization, and signal detection were done as described previously (27Bellí G. Garí E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Signals were quantified using the Lumi-Imager equipment (Roche Applied Science) software. Background values were determined for a region lacking visible signal, of the same size as the measured band and adjacent to it, and such background was subtracted for the respective band signal value. kD Calculations and Gene Classification According to Their Deviation from Constant Stability—RAs were assumed to be at a steady state at the onset of stress. Therefore, the initial (steady-state) kD was calculated as the ratio of TR to RA values determined at time 0. After the onset of stress, under (presumably) non-steady-state conditions, the decay rates were inferred from the experimental values of TR and RA supplied by the GRO technique along the time course. Assuming a linear variation of TR in between experimentally determined values, the following relation between TR, RA, and kD has been demonstrated to hold (3Pérez-Ortín J.E. Alepuz P.M. Moreno J. Trends Genet. 2007; 23: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar) [(TR2−TR1)/(t2−t1)]−TR2·kD+RA2·kD2=[[(TR2−TR1)/(t2−t1)]−TR1·kD+RA1·kD2]·exp−[kD·(t2−t1)](Eq. 1) where TR1, TR2, and RA1, and RA2 are the experimentally determined values for TR and RA at successive time points t1 and t2. By numerically solving for kD (using a bisection algorithm written as a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) program into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet) in the above equation, a mean kD value for the time interval between t1 and t2 was obtained. The absolute values of the deviations of the kD for every gene from its initial steady-state value (t0) were summed up for all time points, and the sums for 4961 genes (those with values for six time points) were ranked. Clustering Procedures—Changes in TR and RA, as well as mRNA stability estimates for all yeast genes, were evaluated by cluster analysis of normalized averaged values. For cluster analysis of the results, we used the Gene Expression Pattern Analysis Suite v 3.1 (GEPAS) included in the web server of CIPF Bioinformatic Unit, as described (4García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To test the potential enrichment in Gene Ontology (GO) categories in the different groupings obtained in this study, we used the FuncAssociate server, which uses a Monte Carlo simulation approach and accepts only significant GO categories according to their adjusted p value (computed from the fraction of 1000 simulations under the null-hypothesis with the same or smaller p value and after correction for multiple simultaneous tests). Only GO categories with an adjusted p value below 0.05 were considered to be significant. Accession Numbers—Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession numbers for the whole experiment are GSE9645 (RA data) and GSE9663 (TR data). General Cell Responses to Oxidative Stress—At certain non-lethal concentrations, hydroperoxides and other oxidants cause temporary growth arrest at the G1 stage of the S. cerevisiae cell cycle (31Lee J. Romeo A. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24885-24893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Wanke V. Accorsi K. Porro D. Esposito F. Russo T. Vanoni M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To avoid growth arrest, which could mask the direct effects of oxidative stress on general transcription and mRNA stability, we first tested a range of t-BOOH concentrations. We looked for conditions that did not affect exponential growth (when compared with control untreated cultures) but still induced expression of three reporter genes (TRR1, TRX2, HSP12), which have been shown to be induced by oxidative stress in previous studies (1Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3761) Google Scholar, 33Ocón-Garrido E. Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We observed that 0.1 mm t-BOOH was the highest concentration of this oxidant that fulfilled such requirements. Therefore, all subsequent experiments were carried out with t-BOOH at 0.1 mm. We then studied the general transcriptional responses of the cell after an oxidative stress. The total amount of poly(A) mRNA per cell decreased smoothly in the course of the experiment, whereas, as expected, cells continued proliferating (Fig. 1). Whole pol II transcription initially increased relative to time 0, an effect also observed after carbon source shift (4García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), to decrease at later times to levels similar to time 0. Relative TR levels did not decrease as much as relative RA levels, a fact that suggests a general mRNA destabilization following a moderate oxidative stress. Effect of Oxidative Stress on mRNA Levels and Transcription Rates, Gene Profile Clustering—We have used the GRO experimental procedures (4García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol.

This quantal noise produces a dark light of approximately 0.01 photons s(-1) rod(-1) in human, setting the threshold for rod vision. The spontaneous isomerization activity of human cone pigments has long remained a mystery because the effect of a single isomerized pigment molecule in cones, unlike that in rods, is small and beyond measurement. We have now overcome this problem by expressing human red cone pigment transgenically in mouse rods in order to exploit their large single-photon response, especially after genetic removal of a key negative-feedback regulation. Extrapolating the measured quantal noise of transgenic cone pigment to native human red cones, we obtained a dark rate of approximately 10 false events s(-1) cone(-1), almost 10(3)-fold lower than the overall dark transduction noise previously reported in primate cones. Our measurements provide a rationale for why mammalian red, green and blue cones have comparable sensitivities, unlike their amphibian counterparts."

We have previously shown that stable overexpression of aggressive presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer disease attenuated the cellular response to GSMs, resulting in greatly diminished Aβ42 reductions as compared with wild type PS1. We have now used this model system to investigate whether Aβ38 production would be similarly affected indicating coupled generation of Aβ42 and Aβ38 peptides.

This was confirmed with the structurally divergent GSMs ibuprofen and indomethacin. Mass spectrometry analysis and high resolution urea gel electrophoresis further demonstrated that sulindac sulfide did not induce detectable compensatory changes in levels of other Aβ peptide species.

J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the Aβ-producing pathway, APP is cleaved by two aspartyl proteases, first by β-secretase within its ectodomain and subsequently by γ-secretase, which cleaves APP within its transmembrane domain (TMD) (2Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7931-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase is a multiprotein complex with the presenilin (PS) proteins at its enzymatic core (2Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7931-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Because of its imprecise cleavage specificity, γ-secretase generates Aβ peptides of variable length at the carboxyl terminus, with the highly amyloidogenic Aβ42 isoform thought to be the key pathogenic species (3Leuchtenberger S. Beher D. Weggen S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 4337-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A central role of Aβ42 developed largely from genetic research demonstrating that mutations in the APP and PS genes associated with early-onset familial AD (FAD) invariably increase the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in primary fibroblasts and plasma of affected individuals, in transfected cells, and in transgenic animals (3Leuchtenberger S. Beher D. Weggen S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 4337-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast to pan γ-secretase inhibitors that prevent all γ-secretase-mediated cleavage events in APP and other substrates, γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been shown to selectively lower production of the Aβ42 species without affecting other γ-secretase substrates (3Leuchtenberger S.

In addition, mass spectrometry analysis has shown that Aβ42-lowering GSMs induced a concomitant increase in shorter Aβ species, primarily Aβ38 (5Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Smith T.E. Weggen S. Das P.

Conversely, inverse GSMs such as fenofibrate selectively increased Aβ42 production with a concomitant decrease in Aβ38 and other shorter Aβ species (15Kukar T. Murphy M.P. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Weggen S. Smith T.E. Ladd T. Khan M.A. Kache R. Beard J. Dodson M. Merit S. Ozols V.V. Anastasiadis P.Z. Das P. Fauq A. Koo E.H. Golde T.E. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Interestingly, certain pan γ-secretase inhibitors elevated Aβ42 levels at subinhibitory concentrations, and this also correlated with a decrease in Aβ38 levels (16Zhao G. Tan J. Mao G. Cui M.Z. Xu X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1234-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, mutations in a GXXXG motif in the APP TMD decreased Aβ42 generation and increased Aβ38 levels from the mutant substrate (17Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings strongly indicated coordinated production of Aβ42 and shorter species such as Aβ38 by γ-secretase, but no confirmation for or against inter-dependence between these peptides has been provided so far. Importantly, this issue is of significance not only for the mode of action of GSMs but also to understand the molecular mechanism of Aβ generation by γ-secretase. In this respect, it has been proposed that Aβ peptides are generated by sequential cleavage of longer into shorter peptide species (16Zhao G. Tan J. Mao G. Cui M.Z. Xu X. J.

Further, FAD PS1 mutations might lower the catalytic activity of γ-secretase, thereby reducing the turnover of Aβ42 into shorter species (18De Strooper B.

We have recently shown that several FAD PS1 mutations, characterized by their aggressive nature with disease onset in the second to fourth decade in life, rendered cells non-responsive to the ability of GSMs to lower Aβ42 (14Czirr E. Leuchtenberger S. Dorner-Ciossek C. Schneider A. Jucker M. Koo E.H. Pietrzik C.U. Baumann K. Weggen S. J. Biol.

Now, we have used this tissue culture model to investigate a potential precursor-product relationship between Aβ42 and Aβ38 peptide species. Unexpectedly, treatment with structurally divergent GSMs increased Aβ38 production to similar levels in PS1 mutant cell lines as compared with wild type PS1 control cells despite the insensitivity of the mutants to Aβ42 reduction. These data are inconsistent with strictly coordinated cleavages and support independent generation of Aβ42 and the shorter Aβ38 peptides by γ-secretase.

All cell lines were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodiumpyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Dose-response Experiments and Statistical Analysis—Aβ secretion of individual cell lines after GSM treatments was compared in dose-response experiments as described (14Czirr E. Leuchtenberger S.

All cell lines intended for comparison were cultured and treated in parallel at similar cell densities. Cells were cultured in serum-containing medium and treated for 24 h with indicated concentrations of GSMs or Me2SO vehicle. Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ38 levels in conditioned medium were then analyzed by sandwich immunoassay. Duplicate measurements from each drug concentration were averaged and normalized to Me2SO control condition. These experiments were repeated five times, and results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett′s post tests using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). Aβ Liquid Phase Electrochemiluminescence Assay—Aβ levels were analyzed by sandwich immunoassay as described (14Czirr E. Leuchtenberger S. Dorner-Ciossek C. Schneider A. Jucker M. Koo E.H.

In brief, the biotinylated antibody 6E10 was used as capture antibody, and carboxyl terminus-specific Aβ antibodies BAP24, BAP15, and BAP29 were labeled with TAG electrochemiluminescent label (Bioveris, Gaithersburg, MD) and used for detection. Culture media were collected following conditioning for 24 h, cell debris was removed, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) was added. For liquid phase electrochemiluminescence assay analysis, conditioned media were incubated for 3 h with M-280 paramagnetic beads (Invitrogen) and antibodies 6E10 and BAP24-TAG (for Aβ40), BAP15-TAG (Aβ42), or BAP29-TAG (Aβ38). Electrochemiluminescence was quantified using an M-Series M8 analyzer (Bioveris). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry of Aβ peptides was performed on a 4800 MALDI-TOF-TOF (Applied Biosystems/MDS-Sceix, Foster City, CA). Aβ peptides were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium with Ab9 antibody covalently coupled to Seize™ beads (Pierce). Peptides were eluted from the beads with 25% 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid:75% acetonitrile. Samples were mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix in methanol:acetonitrile:water (36%:56%:8%) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and spotted on the MALDI target. Mass spectra were acquired from m/z 3500–5000 Da in reflector positive mode at 10,000 shots/spectrum using single shot protection and a delayed extraction time of 420 ns. The area of the isotope pattern (isotopic cluster area) was used as a measure of apparent relative abundance and expressed asa%of total. Results from three independent experiments were averaged for statistical analysis. Urea Gel Electrophoresis—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl), and Aβ peptides from 1.25 mg of total protein were immunoprecipitated using 25 μl of Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Hamburg, Germany) coated with 1E8 monoclonal antibody directed against the amino terminus of Aβ (Bayer-Schering AG). Immunoprecipitated material or conditioned supernatants were separated on 10% Bicine/Tris gels containing 8 m urea (22Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Verhamme J. Tolia A. Horre K. Wiltfang J. Esselmann H. De Strooper B. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and Aβ peptide species were revealed by Western blotting using antibody 1E8. Synthetic Aβ peptides of different size were run in parallel in the same gel system and under the same conditions for the identification and quantification of Aβ peptides by densitometry. Immunoreactive band intensities were quantified with the Quantity One v4.1 software (Bio-Rad). All samples were run as duplicates, and each gel carried a five-step dilution series of a synthetic Aβ peptide mix. Bands were quantified relative to this dilution series. The inter- and intra-assay coefficients were below 10%. Mean values were used for subsequent calculations. We previously demonstrated that aggressive PS1 mutations associated with early onset FAD displayed a dramatic increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (14Czirr E. Leuchtenberger S. Dorner-Ciossek C.

Further, these mutants were partially non-responsive to pan γ-secretase inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, indicating that certain AD tissue culture and animal models harboring aggressive PS1 mutations might not be suitable to assess the potency and efficacy of γ-secretase inhibitors. In the same study, we showed that these PS1 mutations were also insensitive to the Aβ42-lowering activity of GSMs (14Czirr E. Leuchtenberger S. Dorner-Ciossek C. Schneider A. Jucker M. Koo E.H. Pietrzik C.U. Baumann K. Weggen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24504-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For these experiments, CHO cells with stable co-expression of APP and wild type PS1 (PS1-WT) or the PS1 mutants PS1-P117L, PS1-L166P, PS1-G384A, and PS1-ΔExon9 were treated with 30–60 μm of the GSM sulindac sulfide (SS), Aβ42 levels in corresponding cell culture supernatants were determined, and Aβ42 secretion of individual cell lines was assessed. All cell lines expressing mutant PS1 were either completely refractory to SS (PS1-ΔExon9, PS1-L166P) with no Aβ42 reductions or showed only minor Aβ42 reductions (10% reduction at 60 μm, PS1-P117L, PS1-G384A), whereas PS1-WT control cells displayed robust dose-dependent reductions in Aβ42 levels (40% at 60 μm) (14Czirr E. Leuchtenberger S. Dorner-Ciossek C. Schneider A. Jucker M. Koo E.H. Pietrzik C.U. Baumann K. Weggen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24504-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We now took advantage of this culture system to investigate a potential precursor-product relationship between Aβ42 and Aβ38 peptides by measuring Aβ38 levels in culture supernatants from the same experiments. If Aβ38 production by γ-secretase were strictly, inversely coupled to Aβ42 production or were dependent on Aβ42 turnover, then treatment of PS1 mutant cell lines with GSMs should also result in greatly diminished Aβ38 elevations as compared with cells expressing PS1-WT. However, we found that sulindac sulfide treatment robustly increased Aβ38 levels in a dose-dependent manner from all PS1 mutant cell lines without any significant difference as compared with PS1-WT control cells (Fig. 1 and Table 1). To exclude a compound-specific effect, we repeated these experiments with the structurally divergent GSM ibuprofen, which belongs to the aryl propionic acid class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Fig. 2). Cell lines expressing PS1-WT or mutant PS1 were treated with 250 μm ibuprofen, and Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ38 levels in culture supernatants were measured and compared by one-way ANOVA. At this concentration, ibuprofen did not cause toxicity in CHO cells (7Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) and no significant reductions in Aβ40 levels were observed (data not shown). In PS1-WT control cells, ibuprofen induced a strong reduction in Aβ42 levels whereas all cell lines expressing PS1 mutants displayed a significantly attenuated response (Fig. 2A and Table 2). In contrast, comparable with our findings with sulindac sulfide, Aβ38 levels were elevated by ibuprofen treatment in PS1 mutant cell lines indistinguishable to PS1-WT control cells (Fig. 2B and Table 2). This was further confirmed with the GSM indomethacin (data not shown).TABLE 1Aβ38 levels are similarly increased in cell lines expressing wild type or mutant PS1 after treatment with the γ-secretase modulator sulindac sulfideSulindac sulfideCell lineAβ38 levels (% control ± S.E.)30 μm60 μmPS1-WT147.88 ± 3.37190.44 ± 5.65PS1-ΔExon9164.01 ± 7.49186.59 ± 10.81PS1-P117L157.00 ± 3.55215.01 ± 5.55PS1-L166P137.77 ± 5.62175.07 ± 9.19PS1-G384A146.37 ± 4.84209.264 ± 6.56 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2PS1 mutants are non-responsive to the Aβ42-lowering activity of ibuprofen but display similar increase of Aβ38 levels as compared with wild type PS1.

Open table in a new tab To examine the possibility that PS1 mutants would cause overall alterations in the pattern of Aβ peptides or that GSM treatment would induce compensatory changes in other species not detectable with our carboxyl terminus-specific Aβ antibodies, we analyzed the full spectrum of Aβ peptides secreted by PS1-WT control cells or cells expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-ΔExon9 by mass spectrometry. Cells were treated with 60 μm SS, and tissue culture supernatants were immunoprecipitated with antibody Ab9 recognizing amino acids 1–16 of the human Aβ sequence. The immunoprecipitated material was then analyzed by MALDI-TOF-TOF. To determine the relative abundance of individual Aβ peptides, the area of the isotopic cluster for each peptide was analyzed (Fig. 3). We observed that this tended to be more sensitive than measuring peak height alone (data not shown). The profiles of Aβ peptides produced by cells expressing PS1 mutants have not been examined in depth previously. Interestingly, although the full range of Aβ peptides from Aβ1–33 to Aβ1–40 and Aβ42 was produced, we observed that Aβ34 levels appeared slightly higher in PS1 mutant cells as compared with PS1-WT control cells (Fig. 3A). Following SS treatment, the MALDI-TOF results also confirmed our sandwich immunoassay data, namely, cells expressing PS1 mutants displayed an attenuated response to SS with diminished Aβ42 reductions as compared with PS1-WT control cells, whereas the levels of Aβ38 were increased in all cell lines. More importantly, no substantial additional changes in the pattern of Aβ peptides were observed after SS treatment in PS1 mutant cells or PS1-WT control cells (Fig. 3). However, it remains plausible that Aβ38 peptides could be generated by trimming of other longer species such as Aβ45/Aβ46 in PS1 mutant cells. In support of this possibility, replacement of the Aβ40 and Aβ42 cleavage sites in the APP TMD by tryptophan mutagenesis abolished Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion and caused accumulation of longer Aβ peptides in cell lysates but still allowed secretion of Aβ38 (26Sato T. Tanimura Y. Hirotani N. Saido T.C. Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The highly hydrophobic Aβ peptides longer than Aβ42 are inefficiently secreted and cannot be analyzed by mass spectrometry (19Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Consequently, we used high resolution urea gel electrophoresis to examine longer Aβ species in cell lysates. In cell supernatants, we were able to detect Aβ peptides ranging from Aβ37 to Aβ40 and Aβ42 by urea gel electrophoresis as previously shown (22Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Verhamme J. Tolia A. Horre K. Wiltfang J. Esselmann H. De Strooper B. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Confirming our sandwich immunoassay and mass spectrometry results, treatment with sulindac sulfide reduced Aβ42 and increased Aβ38 levels in PS1-WT cells, whereas in cells expressing PS1 mutants L166P or G384A Aβ38 levels were increased despite unchanged Aβ42 levels (Fig. 4A). In corresponding cell lysates from the same experiments (Fig. 4B), we further detected minute amounts of longer Aβ species such as Aβ44, Aβ45, and Aβ46, but these peptides were not differentially affected by GSM treatment. In fact, careful quantitative analysis of several independent experiments showed that the intracellular pool of all detectable Aβ peptides, including Aβ42 and Aβ38, was not affected by GSM treatment in either PS1-WT or PS1 mutant cells (Fig. 4C). We have reported previously that sulindac sulfide treatment was able to lower intracellular Aβ42 levels in CHO cells with stable co-expression of APP and the PS1 mutant PS1-M146L (12Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Pietrzik C.U. Ozols V. Fauq A. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31831-31837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, in the same study, we showed that the PS1-M146L mutation strongly enhances the cellular response to Aβ42-lowering GSMs as compared with PS1-WT (12Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Pietrzik C.U. Ozols V. Fauq A. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31831-31837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at the time, our analysis of intracellular Aβ species using less developed protocols for immunoprecipitation and Western blot detection was evidently close to the detection limit. Our new findings now clearly demonstrate that sulindac sulfide treatment exclusively affects the secreted pool of Aβ42 peptides. This observation in conjunction with the very low abundance of longer Aβ peptides in our cell lines argues against the possibility that the increased Aβ38 levels in PS1 mutant cells after GSM treatment can be explained by enhanced turnover of intracellular Aβ peptides longer than Aβ42. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that Aβ42 and Aβ38 peptides can be generated independently by γ-secretase and that the production of these peptides is not constrained by a stringent precursor-product relationship.FIGURE 4Urea gel electrophoresis analysis of Aβ peptide species after treatment with the γ-secretase modulator sulindac sulfide. A, CHO cells with stable co-expression of wild type APP and wild type PS1 (PS1-WT) or FAD mutants PS1-L166P or PS1-G384A were treated with 60 μm of the γ-secretase modulator sulindac sulfide (SS) or Me2SO vehicle. Cell supernatants were separated on urea SDS-gels, and Aβ peptides were detected by Western blotting with antibody 1E8. The first three lanes (M) show serial dilutions of synthetic marker peptides for the identification of matching Aβ peptide species in the cell supernatants. Peptides ranging from Aβ1–37 to Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were detected. In accordance with the sandwich immunoassay and mass spectrometry results, cells expressing PS1 mutants displayed diminished Aβ42 reductions in cell supernatants after SS treatment as compared with PS1-WT cells, whereas Aβ38 levels were increased in cell supernatants of both PS1-WT and PS1 mutant cells. Other detectable Aβ peptide species, Aβ37 and Aβ39, were unchanged by SS treatment. One of three representative experiments is shown. B, analysis of Aβ peptide species in corresponding cell lysates of the same experiment. Aβ peptides were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with antibody 1E8, the immunoprecipitated material was separated by urea gel electrophoresis, and Aβ peptides were detected by Western blotting with antibody 1E8. In addition to the Aβ peptide species detected in cell supernatants, cell lysates contained minute amounts of peptides longer than Aβ42, such as Aβ44, Aβ45, and Aβ46. Levels of these peptides were not affected by SS treatment in either PS1-WT or PS1 mutant cells. The lane on the right side shows separation of a mixture of synthetic peptides ranging from Aβ41 to Aβ49. The urea gel system did not allow clear separation of Aβ41, Aβ42, and Aβ43 or peptides Aβ46, Aβ47, Aβ48, and Aβ49. The lower panel shows a longer exposure of the same gel for the area containing peptides >Aβ42. C, densitometric quantification of Aβ peptide species from three independent experiments demonstrated that the intracellular pool of all detectable Aβ peptides, including Aβ42 and Aβ38, was unchanged by SS treatment in either PS1-WT or PS1 mutant cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) How do our observations conform to the current models of Aβ generation by γ-secretase? After ectodomain shedding of APP by β-secretase, the remaining membrane-bound fragment becomes a substrate for γ-secretase and is cleaved at multiple sites within its TMD (Fig. 5). The abundance of proteolytic products indicates that predominant γ-secretase cleavages occur after Val-40 (generating Aβ40), after Ala-42 (Aβ42), and after Leu-49 (ϵ-cleavage), the latter producing the APP intracellular domain, a cytosolic fragment with potential signaling functions (2Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7931-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Less abundant peptides are generated by cleavage after various other residues and have been identified in cell supernatants (Aβ37, Aβ38, Aβ39) or cell lysates (Aβ43, Aβ45, Aβ46, Aβ48) (19Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that the APP TMD has α-helical conformation with 3.6 residues forming one complete turn (27Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H. Uljon S.N. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 28Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Rahmati T. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), which would align the cleavage sites for Aβ40, Aβ43, Aβ46, and ϵ-cleavage on one surface of the helix and cleavage sites for Aβ38, Aβ42, Aβ45, and Aβ48 on the opposite surface (Fig. 5). It remains to be clarified whether these cleavages occur simultaneously and independently of each other or whether Aβ peptides are generated by sequential trimming of longer into shorter species (18De Strooper B. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 20Wolfe M.S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). If the cleavages occur independently of each other, then FAD-associated mutations in PS or APP or GSM treatment might simply result in subtle changes in substrate presentation to the active site of γ-secretase (3Leuchtenberger S. Beher D. Weggen S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 4337-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In case of a γ-secretase complex containing PS1-WT, GSM treatment might favor exposure of the peptide bond at the Aβ38 cleavage site at the expense of production of the longer Aβ42 peptide. In contrast, aggressive PS1 mutations that are non-responsive to GSMs might confer drastic conformational changes on the γ-secretase that are only partially reversible by GSMs, resulting in increased Aβ38 production in the absence of corresponding Aβ42 reductions. On the other hand, several groups have provided strong evidence that Aβ peptides might be generated by sequential proteolytic cleavage, with ϵ-cleavage occurring first and subsequent cleavages taking place at every 3–4 residues along the α-helical surface (16Zhao G. Tan J. Mao G. Cui M.Z. Xu X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1234-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this model, and in accordance with findings that many FAD PS mutations seemed to reduce the catalytic activity of γ-secretase (22Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Verhamme J. Tolia A. Horre K. Wiltfang J. Esselmann H. De Strooper B. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 23Walker E.S. Martinez M. Brunkan A.L. Goate A. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), γ-secretase complexes containing mutant PS might be more prone to release Aβ42 from the active site before further trimming to Aβ38 (18De Strooper B. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 20Wolfe M.S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Conversely, GSMs may strengthen the substrate-enzyme interaction, thereby enhancing the turnover from Aβ42 to Aβ38. Our findings that production of Aβ42 and Aβ38 peptides can be uncoupled favors the first model of independent cleavages by γ-secretase. However, our results do not refute the concept of Aβ generation by sequential γ-secretase cleavage. Our tissue culture model using PS1 mutants and GSM treatment did only allow examining the relationship between Aβ42 and Aβ38 species. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that the presence of mutant PS1 in the γ-secretase complex somehow uncouples Aβ42 and Aβ38 production. During preparation of this report, we learned that another laboratory had also observed uncoupling of Aβ42 and Aβ38 generation after GSM treatment in cell lines expressing mutant PS1 and in an AD transgenic mouse model expressing mutant PS2 (29Page R.M. Baumann K. Tomioka M. Perez-Revuelta B.I. Fukumori A. Jacobsen H. Flohr A. Luebbers T. Ozmen L. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 677-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Taken together, these and our findings suggest that a pure sequential cleavage model could be an oversimplification and that the mechanism of Aβ generation by γ-secretase might be even more complex than previously assumed. Moreover, it raises the possibility that selective modulators of Aβ42 production might exist that do not cause induction of shorter Aβ peptides. This is also supported by the observation that the inverse GSM celecoxib did not affect Aβ38 levels (15Kukar T. Murphy M.P. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Weggen S. Smith T.E. Ladd T. Khan M.A. Kache R.

As a consequence, reliance on Aβ38 elevation as more easily detectable, surrogate readout could lead to false negative results in drug screenings for Aβ42-lowering GSMs. We thank Dr. Manfred Brockhaus (F.

https://openalex.org/W2154620297,"Misfolding and aggregation of normally soluble proteins into amyloid fibrils and their deposition and accumulation underlies a variety of clinically significant diseases. Fibrillar aggregates with amyloid-like properties can also be generated in vitro from pure proteins and peptides, including those not known to be associated with amyloidosis. Whereas biophysical studies of amyloid-like fibrils formed in vitro have provided important insights into the molecular mechanisms of amyloid generation and the structural properties of the fibrils formed, amyloidogenic proteins are typically exposed to mild or more extreme denaturing conditions to induce rapid fibril formation in vitro. Whether the structure of the resulting assemblies is representative of their natural in vivo counterparts, thus, remains a fundamental unresolved issue. Here we show using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy that amyloid-like fibrils formed in vitro from natively folded or unfolded beta(2)-microglobulin (the protein associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis) adopt an identical beta-sheet architecture. The same beta-strand signature is observed whether fibril formation in vitro occurs spontaneously or from seeded reactions. Comparison of these spectra with those of amyloid fibrils extracted from patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis revealed an identical amide I' absorbance maximum, suggestive of a characteristic and conserved amyloid fold.

This response was dependent on the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Farnesol treatment reduces the level of IκBα and induces translocation of p65/RelA to the nucleus, its phosphorylation at Ser276, and transactivation of NF-κB-dependent transcription. Moreover, overexpression of IκBα or treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester greatly diminishes the induction of inflammatory gene expression by farnesol. We provide evidence indicating that the farnesol-induced phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser276 is important for optimal transcriptional activity of NF-κB. The MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and knockdown of MEK1/2 expression with small interfering RNAs effectively blocked the phosphorylation of p65/RelA(Ser276) but not that of Ser536, suggesting that this phosphorylation is dependent on the activation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway. We further show that inhibition of MSK1, a kinase acting downstream of MEK1/2-ERK1/2, by H89 or knockdown of MSK1 expression also inhibited phosphorylation of p65/RelA(Ser276), suggesting that this phosphorylation is dependent on MSK1. Knockdown of MEK1/2 or MSK1 expression inhibits farnesol-induced expression of CXCL3, IL-1α, and COX-2 mRNA. Our results indicate that the induction of inflammatory genes by farnesol is mediated by the activation of the NF-κB pathway and involves MEK1/2-ERK1/2-MSK1-dependent phosphorylation of p65/RelA(Ser276). The activation of the NF-κB pathway by farnesol might be part of a prosurvival response during farnesol-induced ER stress.

Recently, we reported that a large number of genes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitory κB; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; CAPE, caffeic acid phenethyl ester; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; QRT, quantitative reverse transcription; eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α. 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitory κB; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; CAPE, caffeic acid phenethyl ester; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; QRT, quantitative reverse transcription; eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α. stress response are rapidly induced by farnesol treatment, suggesting that farnesol-induced apoptosis is coupled to ER stress (26Joo J.H. Liao G. Collins J.B. Grissom S.F. Jetten A.M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7929-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Disturbance of ER homeostasis results in the activation of the unfolded protein response (27Wu J. Kaufman R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 28Szegezdi E. Logue S.E. Gorman A.M. Samali A.

Murakami S. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). During this response, several prosurvival and proapoptotic signals are activated, and, depending on the extent of the ER stress, cells survive or undergo apoptosis. We demonstrated that farnesol induces activation of several MAPK pathways, including p38, MEK1/2-ERK1/2, and JNK1/2 (26Joo J.H. Liao G. Collins J.B. Grissom S.F. Jetten A.M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7929-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and provided evidence indicating that activation of MEK/ERK is an early and upstream event in farnesol-induced ER stress signaling cascade. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of human lung adenocarcinoma H460 cells with farnesol induces the expression of a number of immune response and inflammatory-related genes, including COX-2 and several chemo/cytokines, and examine the signaling pathway involved in the induction of several of these genes. We show that this induction involves activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by farnesol and that this activation, as well as the induction of the expression of immune and inflammatory genes, is dependent on the activation of p65/RelA by the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-MSK1 (mitogen- and stress-activated kinase-1) signaling pathway. The activation of the NF-κB might be part of a prosurvival pathway in the farnesol-induced ER stress response. Materials—Trans,trans-farnesol (farnesol) was purchased from Sigma. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), SB203580, and SP600125 were obtained from Calbiochem, and U0126 was from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell Line and Culture—Human lung adenocarcinoma H460 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were treated with 250 μm farnesol, a dose that was previously shown to be optimal (26Joo J.H. Liao G. Collins J.B. Grissom S.F. Jetten A.M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7929-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis—Microarray analysis with RNA from vehicle- and farnesol-treated cells was performed in duplicate by the NIEHS Microarray Group on Agilent whole human genome microarrays (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), and data were analyzed as described previously (26Joo J.H. Liao G. Collins J.B. Grissom S.F. Jetten A.M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7929-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (Sigma). After centrifugation, proteins were examined by Western blot analysis with the following antibodies: anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (catalog number 9101), anti-ERK1/2 (catalog number 9102), anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (catalog number 9121), anti-MEK1/2 (catalog number 9122), anti-IκBα (catalog number 9242), anti-phospho-NF-κB p65 Ser536 (catalog number 3031), anti-phospho-NF-κB p65 Ser276 (catalog number 3037), anti-phospho-MSK1 (catalog number 9595), and anti-NF-κB p65 (catalog number 3034) from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and anti-MSK1 (catalog number sc-9392) and anti-actin (catalog number sc-1615) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The blots were developed using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Knockdown—Knockdown of MEK1/2 and MSK1 expression in H460 cells was achieved by transfection of siRNA. The siRNAs of human MEK-1 (catalog number sc-29396) and MEK-2 (catalog number sc-35905) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The siMSK1 (catalog number N2006S) and silencer-negative control siRNA (catalog number 4611) were purchased from New England BioLabs (Ipswich, MA) and Ambion (Austin, TX), respectively. Transfection of siRNA was performed using DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL). H460 cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a density 3.3 × 105 cells/well. The next day, cells were treated with the siRNA transfection mixtures following the DharmaFECT General Transfection Protocol. After 48 h of incubation, cells were treated with or without farnesol as indicated and harvested for Western and Northern blot analysis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Preparation of nuclear extracts and EMSA were performed as described previously (31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 H460 cells were harvested, washed two times in ice-cold PBS, and then resuspended in 400 μlof cold cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture). After a 15-min incubation on ice, 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture), incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear extracts were stored at –80 °C. For EMSA, double-stranded NF-κB consensus and mutant oligonucleotide (catalog numbers sc-2505 and sc-2511; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were labeled with [γ-32]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science). The DNA-protein binding reactions were performed in 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 12.5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) with 5 μgof nuclear extract, 105 cpm of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were electrophoresed through 6% polyacrylamide gels in Tris (89 mm)-boric acid (89 mm)-EDTA (2 mm) buffer. For supershift assays, nuclear proteins were incubated with anti-p65 antibody (catalog number sc-109; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 20 min at room temperature prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. IκBα-overexpressing Stable Cell Line—To generate clonal cell lines stably overexpressing wild-type IκBα, H460 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pCMW-IκBα carrying the wild-type IκBα gene (Clontech) or empty plasmid vector using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Single cell colonies were isolated after selection with G418 (800 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and then tested for overexpression of IκBα by Western blot analysis. H460 cells overexpressing IκBα or containing the empty vector are referred to as H460(IκBα) and H460(Empty), respectively. Quantitative Real Time PCR (QRT-PCR)—RNA was isolated using TriReagent (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol. Synthesis of cDNAs was performed using oligo(dT) primer and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Each cDNA sample was analyzed for the expression of IL-6, IL-1β, CXCL3, and COX-2 using the POWER SYBER® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Moreno V. Kitamura M. Xu Q. Lucio-Cazana F.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 149: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were purchased from Sigma. PCR assays were performed using the 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression level was normalized to 18 S RNA, and relative mRNA expression was presented relative to the control. Data were analyzed using Sequence Detection software (version 1.2.2; Applied Biosystems) and are presented as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. NF-κB Reporter Assay—The NF-κB reporter vector, pNF-κB-Luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing five copies of consensus NF-κB binding sequence linked to the minimal E1B promoter-luciferase gene, was used to monitor NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity. A constitutive active SV40 promoter-Renilla luciferase construct, pRL-SV40 (Promega, Madison, WI), was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Plasmids expressing FLAG-p65 (wild type), FLAG-p65/S276A, FLAG-p65/S529A, FLAG-p65/S536A, and FLAG-p65/S276/529/536A (triple mutant) were generously provided by Dr. James M. Samet (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) (35Kim Y.M. Cao D. Reed W. Wu W. Jaspers I. Tal T. Bromberg P.A. Samet J.M. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). H460 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well tissue culture dishes and 12 h later co-transfected with pNF-κB-Luc (0.4 μg), pRL-SV40 (50 ng), and one of the FLAG-p65 expression vectors (0.4 μg) using Fugene 6. Forty-eight h later, cultures were treated with 250 μm farnesol for an additional 24 h before luciferase activities were determined. Statistics—Values are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test. Farnesol Induces Immune Response and Inflammatory-related Genes—Comparison of the gene expression profiles of untreated and farnesol-treated (250 μm for 4 h) H460 cells showed that expression of many immune response and inflammatory genes are greatly enhanced in farnesol-treated cells (Table 1). IL-8 (interleukin-8) expression was the most induced, about 275-fold, whereas IL-1α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-32 were up-regulated 58-, 24-, 4-, and 2-fold, respectively. In addition, the expression of several chemokines, including CXCL3, CXCL2, CCL20, and CXCL1, were increased 155-, 83-, 42-, and 20-fold, respectively. The expression of the cyclooxygenase COX-2, which is involved in various inflammatory processes, is elevated 79-fold in farnesol-treated H460 cells. Expression of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα (NFKBIA) is up-regulated 23-fold. Several transcription factors with established roles in inflammation were found to be highly up-regulated, including FOS (144-fold) and JUN (108-fold), the basic leucine zipper protein NFIL3 (14-fold), and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein CEBPβ (3-fold). Other genes with established roles in inflammation that are up-regulated include PTX3, GDF15, SOCS3, and IRF7. The expression of a few inflammatory genes, including IL-13RA and IRAK1BP1, was slightly down-regulated.TABLE 1Changes in the expression of several immune response and inflammatory genes by farnesolGene nameDescriptionGenBank™Change-foldIL-8Interleukin-8NM_000584275.04CXCL3Chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 3 (MIP2B)NM_002090155.15FOSc-fos protooncogeneNM_005252144.50JUNc-jun protooncogeneNM_002228108.20CXCL2Chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 2 (MIP2A)NM_00208983.82PTGS2Protaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX-2)NM_00096379.10IL-1αInterleukin 1, αNM_00057558.62CCL20Chemokine (CC motif) ligand 20 (MIP-3A)NM_00459142.67PTX3Pentaxin-related gene, rapidly induced by IL-1 βNM_00285242.36IL-6Interleukin-6 (interferon, β2)NM_00060024.54NFKBIANuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene in B-cells inhibitor, αNM_02052923.88CXCL1Chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 1NM_00151120.11GDF15Growth differentiation factor 15 (MIC-1)NM_00486414.65NFIL3Nuclear factor interleukin-3-regulatedNM_00538414.63SOCS3Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3NM_00395512.54HRH1Histamine receptor H1NM_0008617.25IL-1βInterleukin 1, βNM_0005764.92CEBPβCCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), betaNM_0051943.08IL-32Interleukin-32NM_0042212.57IRF7Interferon-regulatory factor 7NM_0040312.14CCL5Chemokine (CC motif) ligand 5 (RANTES)NM_0029851.79IL-13RA1Interleukin-13 receptor α 1NM_001560-1.34IRAK1BP1Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1-binding protein 1AL049321-1.98 Open table in a new tab The induction of several genes was confirmed by QRT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, farnesol induced IL-6, CXCL3, IL-1α, and COX-2 mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner. Expression levels reached a maximum 6 h after the addition of farnesol and then decreased. Farnesol Activates NF-κB Transcription Factor—Activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway is frequently involved in the regulation of many immune response and inflammatory genes (36Chen L.F.

To determine whether farnesol induces activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, we examined the effect of farnesol treatment on several steps that are part of this pathway, including reduction in IκBα protein, translocation of p65 to the nucleus, and the phosphorylation of p65. We first determined the effect of farnesol on the level of IκBα protein. H460 cells were treated with 250 μm farnesol, and at different time intervals the level of total cellular IκBα protein was examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, the level of IκBα was significantly decreased 60 min after the addition of farnesol, whereas after 4 h of treatment IκBα was barely detectable. We further demonstrated that this decrease was accompanied by increased nuclear localization of p65 protein. These results suggest that farnesol induces degradation of IκBα and subsequently translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. Examination of the phosphorylation status of p65 at Ser276 and Ser536, sites that play a critical role in regulating the transcriptional activity of NF-κB (35Kim Y.M. Cao D. Reed W. Wu W. Jaspers I.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), showed that farnesol treatment induced phosphorylation of p65 at both Ser276 and Ser536 (Fig. 2A) in a time course very similar to that of its nuclear localization. The accumulation of p65 in the nucleus is transient and may at least in part be responsible for the transient induction of gene expression observed in Fig. 1. Next, we examined the binding of NF-κB complexes, isolated from vehicle or 250 μm farnesol-treated H460 cells, to the consensus NF-κB DNA binding site (Fig. 2B). EMSA analysis showed increased binding of protein complexes to the 32P-labeled NF-κB response element with extracts from farnesol-treated cells (lane 3). Increasing amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotides competed for the binding (lanes 4 and 5). Nuclear proteins from farnesol-treated cells did not bind to a mutant NF-κB response element (lane 6). The addition of an anti-p65 antibody caused a supershift of the p65-DNA complex (lane 7), whereas no shift was observed with anti-rabbit IgG (lane 8). These observations are in agreement with the conclusion that farnesol treatment causes an increase in the level of nuclear p65/RelA protein complexes that are able to bind NF-κB binding sites. To determine whether the induction of inflammatory genes by farnesol was related to an activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, we examined the effect of increased expression of IκBα on the expression of these genes. For this purpose, we established a cell line H460(IκBα) that stably overexpressed IκBα protein. Fig. 3A shows that the level of IκBα was elevated in H460(IκBα) cells compared with H460(Empty) cells containing the empty vector. Comparison of the induction of CXCL3, IL-1α, and COX-2 in H460(IκBα) cells indicated that the induction of these genes by farnesol was significantly less than in control H460(empty) cells (Fig. 3B). These observations suggest that activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in the induction of CXCL3, IL-1α, and COX-2 by farnesol. This was supported by findings examining the effect of CAPE, a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation (39Nicklaus M.C. Neamati N. Hong H. Mazumder A. Sunder S. Chen J. Milne G.W. Pommier Y. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 40Natarajan K. Singh S. Burke Jr., T.R. Grunberger D. Aggarwal B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9090-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), on the induction of these inflammatory genes. As shown in Fig. 3C, the expression of CXCL3, IL-1α, and COX-2 mRNA was significantly inhibited by CAPE, in agreement with the conclusion that their induction by farnesol requires activation of the NF-κB pathway. Farnesol-triggered Transcriptional Activation of NF-κB Requires p65(Ser276) Phosphorylation—Above, we showed that farnesol induces translocation of p65 to the nucleus and binding of p65 protein complexes to the NF-κB binding site; we therefore determined whether farnesol enhances NF-κB-dependent transactivation. For this purpose, H460 cells were transfected with a NF-κB-Luc reporter plasmid, and the effect of farnesol on reporter activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 4A, farnesol increased NF-κB-dependent reporter activity about 5-fold in a dose-dependent manner. NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity has been reported to depend on the phosphorylation status of p65, which can be phosphorylated at multiple sites, including Ser276, Ser529, and Ser536 (36Chen L.F. Greene W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 37Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vanden Berghe W. Haegeman G.

To determine which phosphorylation site of p65/RelA is important in the induction of NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation by farnesol, we transfected H460 cells with expression vectors containing wild type p65 or several p65 mutants and compared their transcriptional activity in farnesol-treated H460 cells. Western blot analysis showed that p65 and its mutants were equally expressed (Fig. 4B, top). As shown in Fig. 4B (bottom), transfection of wild type p65 increased reporter activity about 6-fold in farnesol-treated cells compared with cells transfecte"
https://openalex.org/W1981388945,"Natural killer (NK) cells play a vital role in the detection and destruction of virally infected and tumor cells during innate immune responses. The highly polymorphic Ly49 family of NK receptors regulates NK cell function by sensing major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules on target cells. Despite the determination of two Ly49-MHC-I complex structures, the molecular features of Ly49 receptors that confer specificity for particular MHC-I alleles have not been identified. To understand the functional architecture of Ly49-binding sites, we determined the crystal structures of Ly49C and Ly49G and completed refinement of the Ly49C-H-2K(b) complex. This information, combined with mutational analysis of Ly49A, permitted a structure-based classification of Ly49s that we used to dissect the binding site into three distinct regions, each having different roles in MHC recognition. One region, located at the center of the binding site, has a similar structure across the Ly49 family and mediates conserved interactions with MHC-I that contribute most to binding. However, the preference of individual Ly49s for particular MHC-I molecules is governed by two regions that flank the central region and are structurally more variable. One of the flanking regions divides Ly49s into those that recognize both H-2D and H-2K versus only H-2D ligands, whereas the other discriminates among H-2D or H-2K alleles. The modular design of Ly49-binding sites provides a framework for predicting the MHC-binding specificity of Ly49s that have not been characterized experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W2039475579,"The activity of PERK, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein kinase, assists in an ER stress response designed to inhibit general protein synthesis while allowing upregulated synthesis of selective proteins such as the ATF4 transcription factor. PERK null mice exhibit phenotypes that especially affect secretory cell types. Although embryonic fibroblasts from these mice are difficult to transfect with high efficiency, we have generated 293 cells stably expressing the PERK-K618A dominant negative mutant. 293/PERK-K618A cells, in response to ER stress: (a) do not properly inhibit general protein synthesis, (b) exhibit defective/delayed induction of ATF4 and BiP, and (c) exhibit exuberant splice activation of XBP1 and robust cleavage activation of ATF6, with abnormal regulation of calreticulin levels. The data suggest compensatory mechanisms allowing for cell survival in the absence of functional PERK. Interestingly, although induction of CHOP (a transcription factor implicated in apoptosis) is notably delayed after onset of ER stress, 293/PERK-K618A cells eventually produce CHOP at normal or even supranormal levels and exhibit increased apoptosis either in response to general ER stress or, more importantly, to specific misfolded secretory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2053144851,"Factor VIIIa is inactivated by a combination of two mechanisms. Activation of factor VIII by thrombin results in a heterotrimeric factor VIIIa that spontaneously inactivates due to dissociation of the A2 subunit. Additionally, factor VIIIa is cleaved by the anticoagulant serine protease, activated protein C, at two cleavage sites, Arg336 in the A1 subunit and Arg562 in the A2 subunit. We previously characterized an engineered variant of factor VIII which contains a disulfide bond between the A2 and the A3 subunits that prevents the spontaneous dissociation of the A2 subunit following thrombin activation. Thus, in the absence of activated protein C, this variant has stable activity following activation by thrombin. To isolate the effects of the individual activated protein C cleavage sites on factor VIIIa, we engineered mutations of the activated protein C cleavage sites into the disulfide bond-cross-linked factor VIII variant. Arg336 cleavage is 6-fold faster than Arg562 cleavage, and the Arg336 cleavage does not fully inactivate factor VIIIa when A2 subunit dissociation is blocked. Protein S enhances both cleavage rates but enhances Arg562 cleavage more than Arg336 cleavage. Factor V also enhances both cleavage rates when protein S is present. Factor V enhances Arg562 cleavage more than Arg336 cleavage as well. As a result, in the presence of both activated protein C cofactors, Arg336 cleavage is only twice as fast as Arg562 cleavage. Therefore, both cleavages contribute significantly to factor VIIIa inactivation. Factor VIIIa is inactivated by a combination of two mechanisms.

Therefore, both cleavages contribute significantly to factor VIIIa inactivation. Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder, affecting 1 in 5000 males. It is caused by deficiency of blood coagulation factor (F) VIII and can cause severe bleeding after e.g. surgery and trauma or chronic bleeding into muscles and joints (1Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Blood. 1998; 92: 3983-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon initial production of small amounts of thrombin, the intrinsic coagulation pathway is initiated by a positive feedback loop (2Gailani D. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1991; 253: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) in which thrombin activates factors V, VIII, and XI. Activated FXI (FXIa) activates FIX to FIXa, which in turn activates FX to FXa. FXa then converts prothrombin to thrombin, leading to fibrin clot formation. FVa and FVIIIa are cofactors for FXa and FIXa, respectively, and enhance the proteolytic function of these enzymes considerably, resulting in rapid production of thrombin. FVIII is a 2332-amino-acid protein with the domain structure A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (3Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Blood. 1988; 71: 539-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is cleaved within the B domain during secretion and circulates in the blood as a heterodimer bound to von Willebrand factor. Thrombin converts FVIII to its activated form (FVIIIa) by cleavages at positions Arg372, Arg740, and Arg1689 (4Amano K. Michnick D.A. Moussalli M. Kaufman R.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cleavage at Arg372 and Arg1689 are both required for complete activation of FVIII (5Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2429-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 6O'Brien D.P. Pattinson J.K. Tuddenham E.G. Blood. 1990; 75: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage at Arg740 leads to dissociation of the B domain from the rest of the molecule, but this cleavage is not required for FVIIIa activation (5Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2429-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). After cleavage and dissociation of the B domain, the remaining subunits form a non-covalently linked heterotrimer, consisting of the A1 subunit (1–372), the A2 subunit (373–740), and a light chain containing the A3, C1, and C2 domains (1690–2332) (8Lollar P. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8056-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Eaton D. Rodriquez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In FVIIIa, the A2 subunit spontaneously dissociates, which inactivates FVIIIa with a half-life of about 2 min (10Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

FVIIIa can also be inactivated through proteolysis by activated protein C (APC), 2The abbreviations used are: APC, activated protein C; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Bis/Tris, 2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time. which cleaves FVIIIa at Arg336 in the A1 domain and at Arg562 in the A2 domain. The proteolytic activity of APC is enhanced by its non-enzymatic cofactors protein S (13Koedam J.A. Meijers J.C.M. Sixma J.J. Bouma B.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 1236-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and factor V (FV) (14Shen L. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18735-18738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein S enhances both FVa (15Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5521-5524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11128-11131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and FVIIIa (13Koedam J.A. Meijers J.C.M. Sixma J.J. Bouma B.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 1236-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5521-5524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inactivation by APC. FV enhances cleavage of FVIIIa by APC in the presence of protein S in purified systems and prolongs clotting time in plasma-based clotting assays measuring FVIIIa activity (14Shen L. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18735-18738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lu D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Long G.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 4708-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This APC cofactor effect of FV was discovered as a result of the thrombosis risk factor FVLeiden (18Dahlbäck B. Carlsson M. Svensson P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar, 19Dahlbäck B. Hildebrand B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). FVLeiden has Arg506 mutated to Gln and therefore cannot be cleaved by APC at this position (20Bertina R.M. Koeleman B.P.C. Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. Dirven R.J. de Ronde H. van der Velden P.A. Reitsma P.H. Nature. 1994; 369: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (3819) Google Scholar, 21Greengard J.S. Sun X. Xu X. Fernández J.A. Griffin J.H. Evatt B. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1361-1362Abstract PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This cleavage is required for APC to fully inactivate FVa (22Nicolaes G.A.F. Tans G. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, it is also required for the APC cofactor activity of FV (23Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2552-2558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of FVIIIa at Arg336 has been correlated with the inactivation of FVIIIa (9Eaton D. Rodriquez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and is kinetically favored over cleavage at Arg562 in APC-mediated inactivation of FVIIIa (17Lu D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Long G.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 4708-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Varfaj F. Neuberg J. Jenkins P.V. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As cleavage at Arg336 also induces A2 subunit dissociation, which fully inactivates FVIIIa, this is considered the primary inactivation site (24Varfaj F. Neuberg J. Jenkins P.V. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cofactors of APC likely influence the cleavage rates of these individual sites differently. O'Brien et al. (25O'Brien L.M. Mastri M. Fay P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1714-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) monitored FVIIIa proteolysis by APC via Western blot using antibodies specific for the A1 or A2 domains and determined that protein S enhanced both cleavages but had a greater effect on cleavage at Arg562. In this study, we characterize the individual cleavages in FVIIIa by APC that led to the inactivation of FVIIIa and the effect of the APC cofactors, protein S and factor V, on each cleavage. Rapid inactivation of FVIIIa due to A2-subunit dissociation makes proteolytic inactivation of FVIIIa hard to study. This problem has been addressed in the past by either using very high concentrations of FVIIIa (24Varfaj F. Neuberg J. Jenkins P.V. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or studying proteolysis of the procofactor FVIII rather than FVIIIa (4Amano K. Michnick D.A. Moussalli M. Kaufman R.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we used a FVIII variant that has a disulfide bond engineered between the A2 and A3 domains (M662C/D1828C FVIII). This disulfide bond prevents dissociation of the A2 domain and stabilizes the molecule (26Gale A.J. Radtke K.P. Cunningham M.A. Chamberlain D. Pellequer J.L. Griffin J.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This allowed us to determine the effects of APC proteolysis on FVIIIa activity independently of the effects of A2 subunit dissociation. A similar disulfide bond introduced in FVa allowed for characterization of individual APC cleavage sites in FVa, independent of A2 subunit dissociation (27Gale A.J. Xu X. Pellequer J.L. Getzoff E.D. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2091-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After activation by thrombin, M662C/D1828C FVIIIa has FIXa cofactor activity similar to that of wild type FVIIIa (26Gale A.J. Radtke K.P. Cunningham M.A. Chamberlain D. Pellequer J.L. Griffin J.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As has been reported (24Varfaj F. Neuberg J. Jenkins P.V. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), cleavage at Arg336 was faster than cleavage at Arg562. However, we found that in the absence of A2 subunit dissociation, cleavage at Arg336 did not fully inactivate FVIIIa, whereas cleavage at Arg562 did. We also found that protein S stimulated both FVIIIa cleavages but stimulated Arg562 cleavage somewhat more. FV also enhanced cleavage at Arg562 more than cleavage at Arg336. As a result, in the presence of both protein S and FV, APC cleavage at Arg336 was only 2-fold faster than APC cleavage at Arg562. FVIII-deficient plasma was from George King Biomedical Inc. (Overland Park, KS). Recombinant FVIII and the plasmid p25D were from Bayer Corp. (Berkeley, CA). Refacto® B domain-deleted FVIII was from Wyeth Corp. (Collegeville, PA). Thrombin, protein S, and factor IXaβ were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Activated protein C and factor X were purchased from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Hirudin was purchased from Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences. Bovine brain phosphatidyl serine and bovine brain phosphatidyl ethanolamine were purchased from Sigma. Bovine liver phosphatidyl choline was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Characterization of FVIII Variants—M662C/D1828C FVIII and other variants were produced essentially as described previously (26Gale A.J. Radtke K.P. Cunningham M.A. Chamberlain D. Pellequer J.L. Griffin J.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Gale A.J. Pellequer J.L. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1966-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The new FVIII variants were also created in plasmid p25D expressing B domain-deleted FVIII (with amino acids 744–1637 deleted) that already contained the M662C and D1828C mutations (p25D-M662C/D1828C), using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Arg336 was mutated to Gln by changing codon CGA to CAG. Arg562 was mutated to Gln by changing codon AGA to CAG. Sequence was verified after subcloning the mutated FVIII sequence into p25D plasmid that did not go through mutagenesis. Plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells and selected for stable expression with Geneticin, and the FVIII gene was purified from the selected HEK293 clones and sequenced to confirm mutant sequence in the clones expressing FVIII. After purification as described (28Gale A.J. Pellequer J.L. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1966-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), proteins were stored in HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). FVIII antigen concentration (mg/ml) was determined using the Asserachrom factor VIIIC:Ag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Diagnostica Stago (Parsippany, NJ) and the Immubind FVIII enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT) using the standard protocols with Refacto® FVIII as the standard. FVIII activity concentration (units/ml) was determined using the Chromogenix Coamatic VIII kit (Diapharma Group, Inc., West Chester, OH) with Refacto® FVIII as the standard (13,350 units/mg). Phospholipid vesicles (40% phosphatidyl choline, 20% phosphatidyl serine, 40% phosphatidyl ethanolamine) were prepared as described (29Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FVIII purity and proteolysis by thrombin and APC were monitored with silver-stained gels. For purity analysis, about 25 ng FVIII was loaded per lane. Samples were either reduced with dithiothreitol followed by treatment with iodoacetamide to prevent reoxidation or just treated with iodoacetamide to block all free cysteines and prevent reduction and disulfide shuffling. For proteolysis, FVIII at 5 nm with 25 μm phospholipid vesicles was incubated with 1.6 units/ml IIa for 1 min followed by the addition of 4.8 units/ml hirudin to inactivate the thrombin before adding 25 nm APC/50 nm protein S for a 1-h incubation at room temperature. The buffers used were the same as for the FXase assays (see below) except that no bovine serum albumin was added. Samples were electrophoresed on a 4–12% Bis/Tris gel with MOPS-SDS buffer (Invitrogen), and gels were stained with the SilverXpress kit (Invitrogen). Functional Assays of FVIIIa Inactivation and Kinetic Properties—The functional properties of FVIIIa were monitored in assays of the FIXa-FVIIIa complex (FXase). We first determined the functional concentration of FVIIIa binding sites for FIXa in FXase assays as described (26Gale A.J. Radtke K.P. Cunningham M.A. Chamberlain D. Pellequer J.L. Griffin J.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Using the FVIIIa concentrations for each FVIIIa variant determined in this manner, FIXa titrations were performed as described with the exception that FVIII was activated with 0.8 units/ml thrombin for 1 min (four times as much as used previously) followed by 4.8 units/ml hirudin to ensure complete inactivation of the thrombin. Data were fit to a hyperbolic curve to derive K½ values for formation of the FVIIIa-FIXa complex (26Gale A.J. Radtke K.P. Cunningham M.A. Chamberlain D. Pellequer J.L. Griffin J.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). FX titrations were performed as described and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to derive kcat and Km (26Gale A.J.

The actual FXase complex concentration value used was the concentration of the limiting component (3–5 pm FVIIIa) times the fraction of this component that should be bound, based on the apparent Kd (K½) of the interaction of that respective FVIIIa variant with FIXa at that concentration (4.9 nm). Assays of FVIIIa inactivation by APC/protein S/FV were performed as follows. FVIII at 5 nm was incubated in FXase buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) with 25 μm phospholipid vesicles. Thrombin was added to this mix at 0.8 units/ml (5 nm) to activate the FVIII, and then at 1 min, 4.8 units/ml hirudin was added to inactivate the thrombin. An aliquot was removed for assay in the FXase assay. Then APC and/or protein S and/or FV were added immediately (time 0 in graph). Aliquots were removed over time and added to FIXa and 25 μm phospholipid vesicles. Then FX was added to initiate the FXase reaction as described (26Gale A.J. Radtke K.P. Cunningham M.A. Chamberlain D. Pellequer J.L. Griffin J.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Final concentrations in the FXase reaction were 150 pm FVIIIa, 2 nm FIXa, and 0.5 μm FX. The reaction was stopped with EDTA, and FXa was measured with substrate S2765 (Chromogenix, Lexington, MA). The variant M662C/D1828C FVIIIa has two APC cleavage sites, and we assume that FVIIIa inactivation can proceed via two pathways FVIIIa→k336FVIIIaint→k562FVIIIiREACTION 1 and FVIIIa→k562′FVIIIiREACTION 2 In the first pathway, FVIIIa is cleaved at Arg336, resulting in a reaction intermediate with partial activity (FVIIIaint); this cleavage is followed by cleavage at Arg562, which results in inactive FVIIIa (FVIIIi). In the second, alternate pathway, FVIIIa is cleaved first at Arg562, and this cleavage fully inactivates FVIIIa. These data for M662C/D1828C-FVIIIa inactivation can be fit to a double exponential decay (22Nicolaes G.A.F. Tans G. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 30Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we determined that we could not achieve first order conditions in this assay setup; thus, the rate of inactivating cleavages was dependent upon substrate concentration. Therefore, we did not determine cleavage rates from curve fits to M662C/D1828C-FVIIIa inactivation. M662C/D1828C/R336Q FVIII and M662C/D1828C/R562Q FVIII inactivation are both the result of a single cleavage; thus, inactivation profiles should fit an exponential decay. However, to account for the lack of first order conditions, only the initial rate of activity loss was determined. Thus, for M662C/D1828C/R336Q FVIII and M662C/D1828C/R562Q FVIII, the initial time points that appeared linear on a log scale were fit to a single exponential decay using non-linear least squares regression analysis with the following equation A=A0e−kt(Eq. 1) where A is activity of FVIIIa (in percentage), A0 is the initial activity of FVIIIa, k is the rate constant in min–1, and t is time in minutes (24Varfaj F. Neuberg J. Jenkins P.V. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The data for M662C/D1828C/R562Q (cleavage at Arg336) were fit to an exponential decay to a plateau of 25%, and we then assumed that 25% was equivalent to complete cleavage at Arg336. Data in Table 1 are presented as rate constants of FVIIIa cleavage assuming that loss of activity is proportional to cleavage rate. Initial concentration of FVIIIa was 5 nm, and APC concentration varied as indicated in the figures.FIGURE 4Time courses of inactivation of M662C/D1828C FVIIIa variants by APC and protein S (PS) or FV.

Pellequer J.L. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1966-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Time courses were started with the addition of APC and protein S to final concentrations of 1 and 100 nm, respectively. Clotting time was converted to units FVIII activity with a standard curve of Refacto® FVIII corrected for the hirudin in the FVIII sample. Preparation and Characterization of FVIII Variants—M662C/D1828C FVIII, which contains an engineered disulfide bond between residues 662 and 1828, has been characterized and described (26Gale A.J. Radtke K.P. Cunningham M.A. Chamberlain D. Pellequer J.L. Griffin J.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This variant was made in the background of B domain-deleted FVIII. Within the construct containing M662C/D1828C FVIII, we introduced individual mutations of the APC cleavage sites. Both sites were mutated from Arg to Gln, generating the constructs, p25D-M662C/D1828C-R336Q and p25D-M662C-D1828C-R562Q. The constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells, and all three proteins were purified as described (26Gale A.J. Radtke K.P. Cunningham M.A. Chamberlain D. Pellequer J.L. Griffin J.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Gale A.J. Pellequer J.L. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1966-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). FVIII concentration and activity were measured as described under “Materials and Methods,” and M662C/D1828C FVIII had specific activity of 7640 units/mg of FVIII, M662C/D1828C/R336Q FVIII had specific activity of 9510 units/mg of FVIII, and M662C/D1828C/R562Q FVIII had specific activity of 14,500 units/mg of FVIII. To evaluate the purity of these preparations and to confirm the presence of the disulfide bond, we ran silver-stained gels of M662C/D1828C FVIII, M662C/D1828C/R336Q FVIII, and M662C/D1828C/R562Q FVIII (Fig. 1A). Each protein was electrophoresed in non-reduced (lanes 1, 3, and 5) and reduced form (lanes 2, 4, and 6). Some free heavy chain and light chain were present in the non-reduced lanes. However, a majority of the FVIII was present as a cross-linked heavy chain and light chain band at about 170 kDa at least for M662C/D1828C FVIII and M662C/D1828C/R562Q FVIII. M662C/D1828C/R336Q FVIII was less pure (see below), so we could not estimate the degree of cross-linking of M662C/D1828C/R336Q FVIII. When the proteins were reduced, most of the protein density shifted from cross-linked heavy chain/light chain to separate heavy chain and light chain. M662C/D1828C FVIII and M662C/D1828C/R562Q FVIII were reasonably pure according to silver stain. However, M662C/D1828C/R336Q FVIII did have significant contaminants present. In particular, in the reduced lane (lane 6), there was a band below 31 kDa, and the apparent light chain band was much more intense than the heavy chain band. This was unlike the other two proteins, which suggested that there may be a contaminating protein in M662C/D1828C/R336Q FVIII that ran at about the same mobility as the light chain in the reduced sample. This was possibly because M662C/D1828C/R336Q FVIII was expressed at significantly lower levels in the stably expressing cell line, so purification was less effective. We were not able to improve this purity in two attempts at producing this variant. To confirm that mutations at Arg336 and Arg562 prevented cleavage by APC, we electrophoresed FVIIIa variants in a reducing gel after proteolysis first by thrombin to activate to FVIIIa and then by APC with protein S (Fig. 1B). Thrombin alone was in lane 10, and thrombin with APC and protein S were in lane 11 to identify bands derived from thrombin, APC, and protein S in the FVIII lanes. M662C/D1828C FVIIIa (lane 3) was cleaved at both Arg336 and Arg562 by APC. Both the A1 subunit was lost (due to Arg336 cleavage) and the A2 subunit was lost (due to Arg562 cleavage). The A1 subunit (see lane 2, 48 kDa, residues 1–372) was replaced by the A1 N-terminal fragment directly above the A2 subunit (43 kDa, residues 1–336). The A2 subunit (41 kDa, residues 373–740) was a sharp band (see lane 2) that was lost completely. The resulting fragments would be around 20 kDa and were not visualized in this gel. Thrombin-activated M662C/D1828C/R562Q FVIIIa (lane 5) had the typical A1 and A2 subunit bands. Following APC cleavage, the A1 band was gone and was replaced by the A1 N-terminal fragment (lane 6), but the A2 band seen in lane 5 remained in lane 6. Thus, there was no cleavage at Gln562. M662C/D1828C/R336Q FVIII was not as pure as the others, so the gel was not as clear. In lane 7, in the absence of thrombin or APC proteolysis, the heavy chain and light chain bands were not clearly separated, as was seen in lanes 1 and 4. As stated, this may have been due to a contaminating protein. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that the major band intensity did not decrease upon thrombin or APC reaction in lanes 8 and 9. Additionally, other contaminating bands were seen, and the FVIIIa bands were not as intense as the other FVIIIa variants. However, the kinetic properties of all three variants were similar (Table 2), suggesting that this contaminant did not affect the functional properties of this FVIII preparation.TABLE 2Kinetic constants of the FXase complex containing variant FVIIIa before and after digest with APCFactor IXa affinity (K½)FX activationKmkcatnmnms-1CC6620.62 ± 0.167.8 ± 1.36.1 ± 2.2CC662 + APCNDNDNDCC662-336Q0.86 ± 0.284.5 ± 1.06.4 ± 2.7CC662-336Q + APCNDNDNDCC662-562Q0.55 ± 0.155.0 ± 0.94.4 ± 0.9CC662-562Q + APC2.10 ± 0.9326 ± 42.5 ± 1.2 Open table in a new tab Nevertheless, the A1 and A2 subunit bands could clearly be seen in lane 8 at 48 and 41 kDa.

However, this was probably a protein present in the mix of thrombin, APC, and protein S (see lane 11). In contrast, the A2 subunit band at 41 kDa was completely gone, indicating complete cleavage at Arg562. Note that the thrombin, which was visible in this gel at about"
https://openalex.org/W2092329631,"RalA is a small GTPase that is thought to facilitate exocytosis through its direct interaction with the mammalian exocyst complex. In this study, we report an essential role for RalA in regulated insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. We employed lentiviral-mediated delivery of RalA short hairpin RNAs to deplete endogenous RalA protein in mouse pancreatic islets and INS-1 beta cells. Perifusion of mouse islets depleted of RalA protein exhibited inhibition of both first and second phases of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Consistently, INS-1 cells depleted of RalA caused a severe inhibition of depolarization-induced insulin exocytosis determined by membrane capacitance, including a reduction in the size of the ready-releasable pool of insulin granules and a reduction in the subsequent mobilization and exocytosis of the reserve pool of granules. Collectively, these data suggest that RalA is a critical component in biphasic insulin release from pancreatic beta cells."

Rab/Ypt proteins present the largest group of small GTPases within the Ras superfamily and play a key role in membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells. More than 60 members of the Rab-GTPase family have been identified (1Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). All Rabs undergo posttranslational modification by prenylation, where in most cases two C-terminal cysteines are modified by geranylgeranyl lipids (1Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 2Khosravi-Far R. Lutz R.J. Cox A.D. Conroy L. Bourne J.R. Sinensky M. Balch W.E. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 2003; 302: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Rab-GTPases can exist in two different conformations: GTP bound (active) and GDP bound (inactive). The process of switching between the active and inactive conformations is controlled by the interaction between Rab-GTPases and regulatory proteins. The active form of Rab proteins interacts with Rab effectors and GTPase-activating proteins, whereas the inactive conformation is recognized by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and by two closely related molecular chaperones, REPs and Rab-GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). REP (Mrs6 in yeast) acts as a type of chaperone, bringing the newly synthesized Rab to the geranylgeranyl transferase for prenylation and subsequently delivering it to a specific membrane. GDI does not facilitate Rab prenylation but serves as a generic regulator for recycling of Rab-GTPases (6Alory C. Balch W.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3857-3867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for use in multiple rounds of membrane transport. It retrieves Rab in the GDP-bound form from the membrane and delivers it to the cytosol, controlling the distribution of Rabs between membranes and cytosol (7Alory C. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). GDI is believed to be stably associated only with GDP-loaded and prenylated Rab/Ypt proteins, ensuring retrieval of inactivated GTPases from the membrane at the end of their functional cycle (8Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Araki S. Hata Y. Isomura M. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2333-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rab-GDI is critically important for the proper functioning of the vesicular transport machinery, and its deletion is lethal in yeast (9Garrett M.D. Zahner J.E. Cheney C.M. Novick P.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1718-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).

This finding is consistent with the common function of REP/GDI (i.e. Rab delivery to specific membranes). GDI lacks the geranylgeranyl transferase binding site, making it unable to assist prenylation, whereas the structural determinants of GDI competence in Rab membrane extraction remain unclear. Protein and Protein Complex Production—Yeast RabGDI and Ypt31Δ2 were produced, and the RabGDI·Ypt31Δ2 complex was purified as described elsewhere (12Ignatev A. Piatkov K. Pylypenko O. Rak A. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 159: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Yeast Rabs and their C-terminally truncated mutants (Ypt1Δ2, Ypt6, Sec4Δ2, Ypt31, Ypt32, Ypt51, Ypt52, Ypt7Δ2, Ypt1Δ14, Sec4Δ29, Ypt7Δ26, and Ypt7Δ10) and MRS6 were produced as N-terminally His6-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain using a pET19 expression vector. Cells were grown in LB medium containing 125 μg/ml of ampicillin at 37 °C until they reached an A600 nm of 0.6, cooled on ice for 10 min, induced with 0.7 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and then grown at 18 °C overnight. Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and disrupted using a microfluidizer. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (35,000 × g), and the supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After elution with a linear imidazole gradient (0-500 mm imidazole), the sample was dialyzed against gel filtration buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C. The concentrated sample was applied to a Superdex200 (26/60) column equilibrated with gel filtration buffer. The fractions corresponding to the protein molecular weight were collected and the proteins were concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Ypt1 C-terminal mutagenesis was performed on a plasmid containing the cDNA fragment Ypt1Δ2 using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). For the Ypt1-CAAX mutant, the nucleotide sequence coding the CIIM amino acid residues was incorporated at the 3′-end of the Ypt1Δ2 coding gene. Further mutations (Ypt1-V191A-CAAX, Ypt1-L193A-CAAX, Ypt1-V191H-CAAX, and Ypt1-L193H-CAAX) were performed on a plasmid containing Ypt1-CAAX cDNA. The mutants were purified as described above. The GDI·Sec4 complex was obtained by mixing the proteins in gel filtration buffer using a 2-fold molar excess of Sec4 and subsequent purification by gel filtration on Superdex200 (26/60). The eluted fractions containing the protein complex, as detected by SDS-PAGE, were collected, concentrated, and flash-frozen and stored at -80 °C. Enzymatic Farnesylation of Ypt1-CAAX Mutants—Purified recombinant Ypt1 mutants containing a C-terminal CAAX box sequence were enzymatically farnesylated in vitro. The reaction mixture contained 75 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 30 μm Ypt1-CAAX, 50 μm farnesyl pyrophosphate (Sigma), and 50 nm of yeast recombinant farnesyl transferase (Sigma). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the farnesylated proteins were purified by gel filtration as described before. Incorporation of the farnesyl moiety was monitored by the molecular weight change using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Measurements—Binding affinities of yeast Rabs and their mutants to GDI and MRS6 were determined by ITC (MicroCal). All proteins were kept in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm GDP. The concentration of the Rab proteins in the syringe was 10-fold higher (100 μm) than the GDI/MRS6 concentration (10 μm) in the cell. In blank experiments, the respective protein was injected from the syringe into the buffer solution, yielding small background heats that were subtracted from the titration experiment data. The titration experiments were carried out at 25 °C. All experiments were performed at least three times.

Prior to data collection, crystals were cryoprotected in a buffer containing 17% ethylene glycol, 50 mm MES pH 6.5, 12% polyethylene glycol 3350 and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. GDI·Sec4 complex crystals were obtained by the same method at 20 °C. 2 μl of 25 mg/ml protein complex solution were mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 12% MME-polyethylene glycol 2000).

Open table in a new tab The GDI·Ypt31 crystal structure was determined by the molecular replacement method with Molrep (14Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) using the GDI structure from the GDI·Ypt1·geranylgeranyl complex (Protein Data Bank code 1UKV) as a search model. The GDI·Ypt31 crystal contained one complex per asymmetric unit, and the molecular replacement solution unambiguously indicated the position of the GDI molecule in the asymmetric unit. The resulting difference electron density maps clearly reflected the position and secondary structure elements of the Ypt31 molecule bound to the GDI that allowed the GTPase model building using the program O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Several iterative cycles of crystallographic refinement with Refmac5 (16Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) and manual model rebuilding were performed to obtain the final GDI·Ypt31 complex structure, which has been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (3CPJ). The GDI·Sec4 complex structure was determined by the molecular replacement method with the GDI structure as a search model. The Matthews coefficient calculated for the GDI·Sec4 crystal indicated that the asymmetric unit probably contains two GDI·Sec4 complexes, whereas only one contrast solution was found by the molecular replacement search with Molrep (14Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The solution was used for subsequent phasing. The calculated difference electron density maps clearly indicated the structural features of Sec4 bound to the GDI molecule and some additional density for another protein molecule. The core secondary structure elements of Sec4 molecule were built, and the GDI molecule was rebuilt manually using the program O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), the initial complex structure was refined with Refmac5 (16Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar), and the resulting electron density maps more clearly out-lined the secondary structure elements of the additional molecule. Its Cα trace was built, and the protein molecule was recognized as a free GDI. Finally, the entire asymmetric unit containing the GDI·Sec4 complex and the free GDI was iteratively rebuilt, and refined resulting in the model were deposited to the Protein Data Bank (3CPH). The yeast GDI crystal structure was determined by the molecular replacement method (14Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) with the GDI from the GDI·Ypt1 complex structure as a search model. Two contrast molecular replacement solutions corresponding to the two molecules in the asymmetric unit were found. The calculated electron density maps and the protein model correlated very well in the GDI domain I region and poorly in domain II. The second domain was removed from the protein model, the model was refined as a rigid body, and the resulting electron density maps were used for manual building of the domain II. After several rounds of manual rebuilding and crystallographic refinement, the yeast GDI crystal structure was deposited to the Protein Data Bank (3CPI). The protein model refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. Model superimposition and r.m.s. deviation calculations were performed using the Swiss-Pdb Viewer (17Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar). During the course of this research, the crystal structures of the yeast GDI apo-form and structures of two unprenylated Rabs (Ypt31 and Sec4) in complex with GDI (Fig. 1A) were solved (Table 2). These protein complex structures represent models of the transient Rab-GDI complex when GDI is bound to a membrane-anchored Rab protein poised to extract Rab to the cytosol, whereas the previously determined prenylated Ypt1·GDI crystal structures (5Rak A. Pylypenko O. Durek T. Watzke A. Kushnir S. Brunsveld L. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Science. 2003; 302: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 10Pylypenko O. Rak A. Durek T.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) represent the state after Rab retrieval from the membrane. The structural comparison reveals significant conformational changes in the GDI molecule occurring upon Rab binding. ITC titration experiments in combination with mutational analyses reveal varying affinities of the different unprenylated or farnesylated yeast Rabs to GDI and MRS6 (Table 1). The thermodynamic properties of GDI-Rab interactions together with structural analysis of GDI-Rab in different conformational states provide mechanistic insights into the GDI competence in prenylated Rab membrane extraction. Structural Features of GDI-Rab Complexes—The structures of prenylated Ypt1·GDI, Ypt31·GDI, and Sec4·GDI demonstrate that GDI binds the Rab molecule via three interaction sites. These are 1) the GDI-Rab binding platform (RBP), located in domain I, which interacts extensively with the globular part of the Rab molecule; 2) the GDI C terminus coordinating region (CCR), located in the cleft between domain I and domain II, which coordinates the flexible extended C terminus of Rab; 3) domain II of GDI, consisting solely of α helices, which form a prenyl-lipid binding pocket, exhibiting an open conformation and accommodating the prenyl moiety of a modified Rab if present (5Rak A. Pylypenko O. Durek T. Watzke A. Kushnir S. Brunsveld L. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Science. 2003; 302: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 10Pylypenko O. Rak A. Durek T.

Conserved GDI-Rab Binding Platform—Ypt1, Sec4 and Ypt31 exhibit 60% primary structure homology. Comparison of the prenylated Ypt1·GDI, Sec4·GDI, and Ypt31·GDI complex structures showed that the three GTPases bound to GDI can be superimposed with a Cα r.m.s. deviation of ∼1 Å, excluding Switch I and the C-terminal variable regions (Fig. 1A). The three complex structures demonstrate the conserved GDI·Rab interface with which the Rab molecule makes direct contacts to the Rab binding platform of GDI, primarily by using the conserved residues from the Switch I and Switch II regions. These regions, along with the C terminus, are known as the most structurally variable and flexible parts in Rab GTPases. Interaction with GDI generates similar Switch II conformations in the different Rabs, making extensive contacts with GDI, whereas the major part of Switch I remains unaffected by the interactions, and its structural organization in the three GTPases is quite different. The Rab GDI binding epitope is formed by a number of conserved amino acid residues (Ile41, Gly42, Asp/Glu44, and Phe45 from Switch I; Trp62, Asp63, Ala65, Gln67, Phe/Tyr70, Thr/Ala72, Thr74, Ser/Thr75, Ser/Ala76, and Arg79 from Switch II) (Fig. 1B). Contribution of the GDI C Terminus Coordinating Region to Rab Binding—The second GDI-Rab binding site (i.e. the C terminus coordinating region) (Fig. 1A) is formed by residues 93-112 from domain I and 226-235 from domain II and represents a hydrophobic cavity on the surface of the protein located between the GDI domains. In the prenylated Ypt1·GDI structures, the CCR is occupied by side chains of hydrophobic amino acid residues Val191 and Leu193 of the C-terminal tail of Ypt1 (Fig. 2A). The hydrophobic contacts are supported by a hydrogen bond involving main chain atoms (the carbonyl oxygen of GDI Phe110 and the NH group of Ypt1 Val191). Primary structure analysis of the Rab GTPases revealed the presence of a Rab C-terminal characteristic sequence (the so-called AXA box) with two conserved next closest aliphatic amino acid residues (5Rak A. Pylypenko O. Durek T. Watzke A. Kushnir S. Brunsveld L. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Science. 2003; 302: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The structures of the Ypt31·GDI and Sec4·GDI complexes confirmed the importance of the AXA box for GDI binding. In the Ypt31·GDI complex structure, most of the Ypt31 C terminus is not structurally defined, as indicated by the absence of electron density for this region, reflecting its flexibility in the crystal. By contrast, the Ypt31 C-terminal AXA motif is well defined and contacts the CCR of GDI in a similar manner to that seen in the Ypt·GDI structure. This involves hydrophobic interactions of Ypt31 residues Ile205 and Leu207 and a hydrogen bond via main chain atoms similar to that observed in the Ypt1·GDI structure (Fig. 2B). The Sec4·GDI structure showed a surprisingly different manner of Sec4 C terminus coordination in the crystal. The Sec4·GDI complex forms a symmetrical dimer (see supplemental material). The dimerization occurs via Sec4 C terminus swapping, such that Sec-4 binds to the CCR of the GDI from the neighboring complex. However, the interactions stabilizing the GTPase AXA box are similar to those observed in the Ypt1·GDI and Ypt31·GDI structures, where the two Sec4 hydrophobic amino acid residues Val190 and Val192 penetrate the hydrophobic pocket that is supplemented with the conserved hydrogen bond formation (Fig. 2C). The Sec4 has a second AXA motif occurring downstream from that observed in the crystal structure, which could also be utilized for binding to GDI CCR of GDI upon GDI·Sec4 interaction. The observed structural similarity in the GDI CCR organization in the GDI·Rab complexes indicates that the Rab C-terminal AXA box serves as a lid for the hydrophobic CCR cavity on the GDI surface. ITC experiments confirmed the thermodynamic preference of shielding the GDI CCR hydrophobic cavity upon complex formation. C-terminally modified yeast Rabs lacking the AXA motif showed weaker GDI/MRS6 binding properties compared with the full-length Rabs (Table 1). Truncation of the entire C-terminal part, including the AXA region (Ypt1Δ14 and Ypt7Δ26), diminishes GDI binding affinities to values undetectable in ITC experiments, whereas the MRS6 binding affinities of the truncated proteins remain detectable but very low. Ypt7 truncation, removing the second aliphatic residue from the AXA characteristic sequence, makes Ypt7Δ10 binding to GDI 3 times weaker compared with full-length protein, and the Ypt7Δ10 mutant binds MRS6 with comparable affinity. However, Ypt7 has an alternative AXA box slightly upstream in the sequence, rendering this result difficult to interpret. The C-terminally truncated Sec4Δ29 lacking the entire flexible C-tail binds GDI 10 times and MRS6 100 times weaker than the full-length protein. Thus, the Rab·GDI/MRS6 AXA box mediated interactions contribute significantly to the complex affinities. The mobile effector loop, a region that is highly conserved among REP/GDIs, (residues 225-228), is a part of GDI CCR and was shown to direct GDI to the membrane and regulate the ability of GDI to retrieve Rab to the cytosol (18Luan P. Heine A. Zenq K. Moyer B. Greasely S.E. Kuhn P. Balch W.E. Wilson I.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), indicating functional importance of GDI CCR. Regulation of the GDI Lipid Binding Pocket Conformation—In the prenylated Ypt1·GDI complex, the lipid binding pocket is open and accommodates the prenyl moiety (5Rak A. Pylypenko O. Durek T. Watzke A. Kushnir S. Brunsveld L. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Science. 2003; 302: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), whereas the apo-form of bovine α-GDI shows a closed lipid binding pocket (7Alory C. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Since have we studied the yeast Rab membrane extraction/delivery system, we have now solved the crystal structure of yeast apo-GDI, which exhibits ∼50% amino acid sequence identity to the bovine equivalent. The yeast apo-GDI structure shows a protein conformation similar to that of bovine GDI (7Alory C. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Cα r.m.s. deviation ∼0.9 A), with a closed lipid binding pocket. Thus, the GDI lipid binding pocket can adopt two conformations, one being the open form when lipid is bound and the other being closed when neither lipid nor Rab is bound. The question that arises at this point is whether the opening of the lipid site is due to the presence of lipid solely or whether the binding of Rab triggers the opening of the lipid binding site, which can then accommodate a prenyl moiety if present. Yeast apo-GDI domain II has a well ordered hydrophobic core stabilizing the α helices D, E, F, G, and H in a tightly packed state, defining the closed conformation of the lipid binding pocket (Fig. 3A). All three Rab·GDI complex structures demonstrate a distinctly different domain II structural arrangement (Fig. 3A). The binding of Rab rearranges the packing of the GDI domain II helices, exposing a part of the hydrophobic core residues and forming a hydrophobic cleft on the surface of GDI. In the prenylated Ypt1·GDI complex, the cleft is occupied by the lipid moieties, whereas in the Ypt31·GDI and Sec4·GDI, the pocket is open and empty (Fig. 1A). This observation indicates that pocket opening is not initiated by the lipid group but is allosterically regulated by Rab binding to GDI in response to the formation of Rab interactions with the RBP and the CCR. Superimposition of apo-GDI on the Rab-bound GDI (Cα r.m.s. deviation 1.6 Å) showed that the β sheets in the GDI molecule build a relatively rigid protein carcass, whereas the α helical regions showed significant shifts in Cα coordinates, demonstrating their involvement in the structural rearrangement on Rab binding (Fig. 3B). In the GDI domain-I, the four helices A, C, I, and N form a bundle. Helix I and the loop adjacent to the helix C belong to RBP and make direct contact with the GTPase upon its binding. Therefore, Rab binding may promote the rearrangement of the GDI helices by pushing helix I toward the GDI core, whereas the loop following helix C is pushed away from the core, resulting in displacement of helices C and N (Fig. 3, A and B). The displaced helices C and N make direct contact with domain II of GDI and appear to induce a conformational change resulting in structural reorganization of domain II. The majority of GDI domain II (helices E, H, G, and F) retains its structure (Cα r.m.s. deviation is 0.36 Å) (Fig. 3C) upon Rab binding. However, there is a change in its orientation relative to domain I, and helix D is not tightly packed within domain II anymore. The side chain of Phe192 located on helix G flips and pushes the loop following helix D away, stabilizing the pocket in the open conformation (Fig. 3C). The observed solvent exposure of the hydrophobic pocket is thermodynamically unfavorable. This, presumably, is the reason for the moderate affinity of GDI to unprenylated Rabs (Table 1). Role of C-terminal Rab Prenylation in GDI/MRS6 Binding—The direct measurement of the affinity of prenylated Rabs to GDI/MRS6 is difficult to perform due to the insolubility of geranylgeranylated Rabs in water. Since it is known that farnesylated proteins are normally soluble, we decided to use this modification to emulate the geranylgeranyl group. In order to do this, Ypt1 was genetically modified by substitution of the C-terminal geranylgeranylation motif with a so-called CAAX box sequence recognizable by farnesyl transferase, an enzyme that performs enzymatic cysteine farnesylation. The enzymatically prenylated Ypt1-CAAX-farnesyl protein was purified as a homogeneous soluble monomer and was used directly for ITC titrations. GDI·Ypt1 and Ypt1-CAAX binding affinities differ only by a factor of 2.5 (Table 1). The affinities of GDI for prenylated (Ypt1-CAAX-farnesyl) and unprenylated (Ypt1-CAAX) Rabs differ by more than 2 orders of magnitude, fitting the established model of a marked preference of GDI for the prenylated forms of Rab proteins (19Araki S. Kikuchi A. Hata Y. Isomura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13007-13015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The measured affinities of MRS6 for prenylated and unprenylated Ypt1-CAAX are comparable, and the dissociation constants differ by just a factor of 2. Thus, the presence of the farnesyl moiety at the C terminus of Rab dramatically increases its affinity to GDI, whereas the affinity to MRS6 does not change significantly. The observed increase in affinity of GDI to Rab upon prenyl group binding might be due to the Rab lipid moiety filling the open hydrophobic lipid binding pocket in GDI, diminishing the solvent-exposed hydrophobic surfaces of the GDI·Rab complex. The large increase in affinity of GDI to Rab upon prenyl group binding appears to be the driving force for the membrane extraction process, as suggested previously (20Goody R.S. Rak A. Alexandrov K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1657-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This property is exclusive to GDI (in contrast to MRS6) and explains the efficiency of GDI in Rab retrieval from membranes. This is in agreement with the recently published data on geranylgeranylated Rab molecules (21Wu Y.W. Tan K.T. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12294-12299Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Importance of the Rab AXA Box for GDI/MRS6 Binding to Prenylated Rabs—To investigate the importance of the hydrophobic component in the AXA box coordination for prenylated Rab GDI and MRS6 binding, the two aliphatic amino acid residues (Val191 and Leu193) (Fig. 2A) were individually mutated to alanines in Ypt1-CAAX. The mutant proteins were enzymatically farnesylated, and binding affinities to GDI and MRS6 were measured (Table 1). The mutation of the first aliphatic residue valine to alanine (V191A) decreased the affinity of Rab to GDI by a factor of 7 and the second (L193A) by a factor of 100. The substitution of the aliphatic residues with the more bulky and polar histidines (V191H and L193H) led to a 200-fold decrease in binding affinities (i.e. levels that are comparable with that of unprenylated YPT1-CAAX to GDI) (Table 1). These data suggest that the Ypt1 AXA box and prenyl moiety binding contribute cooperatively to increase their binding affinities to GDI upon complex formation. It can be further explained by GDI CCR not only binding the AXA box but also directing the prenylated C terminus to the GDI lipid binding pocket. All four farnesylated mutants demonstrated similar MRS6 binding properties, displaying a 5-7-fold increase in the dissociation constants (Table 1) compared with Ypt1-CAAX-farnesyl, indicating the less critical contribution of the prenylated C terminus to the complex formation. Structural-Functional Differences in GDI·Rab and REP1·Rab Complexes—Yeast Rab GTPases bind GDI and MRS6 with variable affinities: from 0.33 to 25 μm for GDI and from 36 nm to 1 μm for MRS6 (Table 1). The pronounced heterogeneity of affinities of Rab·MRS6/GDI interactions nevertheless conforms to a certain rule; the GDI·Rab affinities are always lower than those of the corresponding MRS6·Rab affinities. This demonstrates that MRS6 is a stronger binder of unprenylated Rabs compared with GDI. Comparison of the REP1 structures from the Rab7·REP1 and geranylgeranyl transferase·REP1 complex structures (Protein Data Bank code 1VGO and 1LTX, respectively) revealed that the REP1 Rab binding platform is not altered upon Rab binding (Fig. 3D) (REP1 domain-I Cα r.m.s. deviation 0.54 Å). Thus, the REP1 RBP is preformed for Rab acceptance. By contrast, the GDI requires RBP adjustment to bind the GTPase (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the structural changes in domain I of GDI appear to be coupled to the opening of the lipid binding site, which must in itself cost energy and therefore contribute negatively to the overall affinity. The higher affinity of REP for freshly synthesized Rabs, compared with GDI, will lead to preferential REP·Rab binding, which is biologically reasonable, since REP-supported prenylation is essential for the Rab biological activity. Summarizing the presented structural and biophysical data, we propose a putative mechanism of prenylated Rab membrane extraction driven by GDI (Fig. 4). Prenylated Rabs are localized on the membrane and anchored to the lipid bilayer by prenyl moieties. GDI uses its RBP for initial inter molecular recognition of Rab to form a low affinity complex. The conserved Rab C-terminal AXA box binds to the GDI CCR, increasing the complex affinity and causing the coupled structural adjustment that leads to opening of the lipid binding pocket. By virtue of the latter interaction, the opened GDI lipid binding pocket will be located in the vicinity of the Rab lipid anchor, poised to interact with the membrane-inserted lipid groups. Release of the lipid moieties from the membrane and binding into the open hydrophobic pocket of GDI results in the high affinity GDI·Rab complex formation and release from the membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2063016542,"The mechanism of gene regulation by steroids in bacteria is still a mystery. We use steroid-inducible 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase (3α-HSD/CR) as a reporter system to study steroid signaling in Comamonas testosteroni. In previous investigations we cloned and characterized the 3α-HSD/CR-encoding gene, hsdA. In addition, we identified two negative regulator genes (repA and repB) in the vicinity of hsdA, the protein products which repress hsdA expression on the level of transcription and translation, respectively. Recently, a positive regulator of hsdA expression, TeiR (testosterone-inducible regulator), was found by transposon mutagenesis, but the mode of its action remained obscure. In the present work we produced a TeiR-green fluorescent fusion protein and showed that TeiR is a membrane protein with asymmetrical localization at one of the cell poles of C. testosteroni. Knock-out mutants of the teiR gene revealed that TeiR provides swimming and twitching motility of C. testosteroni to the steroid substrate source. TeiR also mediated an induced expression of 3α-HSD/CR which was paralleled by an enhanced catabolism of testosterone. We also found that TeiR responds to a variety of different steroids other than testosterone. Biochemical analysis with several deletion mutants of the teiR gene revealed TeiR to consist of three different functional domains, an N-terminal domain important for membrane association, a central steroid binding site, and a C-terminal part mediating TeiR function. Finally, we could demonstrate that TeiR works as a kinase in the steroid signaling chain in C. testosteroni. Overall, we provide evidence that TeiR mediates steroid sensing and metabolism in C. testosteroni via its steroid binding and kinase activity. The mechanism of gene regulation by steroids in bacteria is still a mystery. We use steroid-inducible 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase (3α-HSD/CR) as a reporter system to study steroid signaling in Comamonas testosteroni. In previous investigations we cloned and characterized the 3α-HSD/CR-encoding gene, hsdA. In addition, we identified two negative regulator genes (repA and repB) in the vicinity of hsdA, the protein products which repress hsdA expression on the level of transcription and translation, respectively. Recently, a positive regulator of hsdA expression, TeiR (testosterone-inducible regulator), was found by transposon mutagenesis, but the mode of its action remained obscure. In the present work we produced a TeiR-green fluorescent fusion protein and showed that TeiR is a membrane protein with asymmetrical localization at one of the cell poles of C. testosteroni. Knock-out mutants of the teiR gene revealed that TeiR provides swimming and twitching motility of C. testosteroni to the steroid substrate source. TeiR also mediated an induced expression of 3α-HSD/CR which was paralleled by an enhanced catabolism of testosterone.

Overall, we provide evidence that TeiR mediates steroid sensing and metabolism in C. testosteroni via its steroid binding and kinase activity. Comamonas testosteroni (formerly termed Pseudomonas testosteroni (1Tamaoka J. Ha D.M. Komagata K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1987; 37: 52-59Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar)) is a Gram-negative bacterium that is able to utilize a variety of steroids and aromatic compounds as the sole carbon and energy source (2Marcus P.I.

Steroids are widespread in the environment occurring as cholesterol, sex, and adrenal cortical hormones of mammals, molting hormones in insects, or phytosterols in plants (5Kieslich K. J.

Accordingly, C. testosteroni inhabits a wide variety of environments, including soil and water as well as animal and plant tissues (9Barbaro D.J. Mackowiak P.A. Barth S.S. Southern Jr., P.M. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1987; 9: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Busse H.J. el Banna T. Oyaizu H. Auling G. Int. J. Syst.

The complex degradation pathway for steroids in C. testosteroni has been studied earlier by simultaneous identification of the participating genes and by isolation of the main intermediate compounds that have accumulated in gene-disrupted mutants (12Horinouchi M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3238-3247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The steroid catabolic pathway is initiated by oxidizing the hydroxyl group at the C3 position, thereby forming a ketone group. This oxidation is followed by isomerization, dehydrogenation, and hydroxylation of the steroid, which leads to the opening of the B-ring. Aromatization and further oxidation reactions result in meta cleavage of the A-ring, finally resulting in common intermediates that enter conventional central metabolism pathways (13Horinouchi M. Hayashi T. Koshino H. Kurita T. Kudo T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 5275-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ring cleavage procedure and the enzymes involved therein are similar to those of a common bacterial aromatic compound degradation pathway (20Skowasch D. Möbus E. Maser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Möbus E. Jahn M. Schmid R. Jahn D. Maser E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5951-5955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been estimated that the complete degradation of the steroid nucleus to CO2 and H2O requires more than 20 enzymatic reactions. Interestingly, the catabolic enzymes for steroid degradation are usually not constitutively expressed but, rather, are induced by their respective substrates (20Skowasch D. Möbus E. Maser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Möbus E. Jahn M. Schmid R. Jahn D. Maser E. J.

However, the organization and regulation of their corresponding genes is largely unknown, although two steroid degradation gene clusters in C. testosteroni TA441 were identified (12Horinouchi M. Hayashi T. Yamamoto T. Kudo T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 4421-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Horinouchi M. Kurita T. Yamamoto T. Hatori E. Hayashi T. Kudo T. Biochem.

In previous investigations we identified 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase (3α-HSD/CR) 2The abbreviations used are: 3α-HSD/CR, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RepA, repressor A; RepB, repressor B; TeiR, testosterone-inducible regulator; GFP, green fluorescence protein; SIN, standard I nutrition. 2The abbreviations used are: 3α-HSD/CR, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RepA, repressor A; RepB, repressor B; TeiR, testosterone-inducible regulator; GFP, green fluorescence protein; SIN, standard I nutrition. as an important enzyme in steroid degradation of C. testosteroni (21Möbus E. Jahn M. Schmid R. Jahn D. Maser E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5951-5955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Möbus E. Maser E. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 241: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By catalyzing the interconversion of hydroxyl and oxo groups at position 3 of the steroid ring structure, 3α-HSD/CR initiates steroid ring opening and is, therefore, of importance for complete steroid mineralization. Moreover, this enzyme is capable of catalyzing the carbonyl reduction of nonsteroidal xenobiotic carbonyl compounds (25Oppermann U.C.T. Maser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Oppermann C.T. Netter K.J. Maser E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 328: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that this substrate pluripotency not only enhances the metabolic capacity of insecticide degradation but also increases the resistance of C. testosteroni towards the steroid antibiotic fusidic acid (24Oppermann U.C.T. Belai I. Maser E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the expression of the encoding gene, hsdA, is inducible by steroids such as testosterone and progesterone, elucidation of the hsdA-inducing mechanism may shed light on the regulation and genetics of the entire steroid degradation pathway in C. testosteroni. Recently, we identified two genes involved in hsdA regulation and reported a two repressor model to control hsdA gene expression. Repressor A (RepA) was found to bind to two operator sequences upstream of hsdA, thereby preventing hsdA transcription (28Xiong G. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Repressor B (RepB) turned out to bind to the mRNA of 3α-HSD/CR, thereby interfering with hsdA translation (29Xiong G. Martin H.J. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47400-47407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By transposon mutagenesis, teiR (testosterone-inducible regulator) was identified, a gene that was hypothesized to encode a positive regulator of steroid degradation in C. testosteroni ATCC11996 in the presence of testosterone (30Pruneda-Paz J.L. Linares M. Cabrera J.E. Genti-Raimondi S. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1430-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A similar positive regulator (TesR) was cloned and postulated to regulate a steroid degradation gene clusters in C. testosteroni TA441 (14Horinouchi M. Kurita T. Yamamoto T. Hatori E. Hayashi T. Kudo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism and mode of action by which these positive regulatory elements control the steroid degradation gene cluster remained obscure. On the other hand, detailed knowledge on hsdA regulation is of great importance and might give a general view on steroid dependent gene regulation in bacteria. In the present investigation we could unravel the role of TeiR in steroid-dependent gene regulation in C. testosteroni and demonstrate that TeiR is a kinase that drives steroid sensing and metabolism in C. testosteroni. We cloned the teiR gene, produced recombinant TeiR protein as well as respective antibodies, and by constructing a TeiR-GFP fusion protein, proved that TeiR is a membrane protein with almost exclusive polar localization. Studies with wild type and teiR knock-out mutants revealed that TeiR induces hsdA expression and testosterone catabolism in C. testosteroni. These knock-out studies also showed that, in addition to testosterone, a variety of other steroids can bind to TeiR. Deletion mutants of the teiR gene disclosed that the protein consists of three main domains, an N-terminal membrane attachment site, a central hydrophobic steroid binding sequence, and a C-terminal part mediating its regulatory function. More detailed analysis showed that TeiR is required for twitching and swimming of C. testosteroni in the medium to the steroid source and that the mode of intracellular signal transduction occurs via its kinase activity. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Host strains Escherichia coli HB101 (Promega) and C. testosteroni ATCC 11996 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen) were used for cloning and gene expression. Subcloning of fragments was carried out in plasmids pBBR1MCS-2 (containing the kanamycin resistance gene; a gift from Peterson and co-workers (31Kovach M.E. Elzer P.H. Hill D.S. Robertson G.T. Farris M.A. Roop II, R.M. Peterson K.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar)) and pUC18 (containing the ampicillin resistance gene and obtained from Invitrogen). Plasmid pK18 containing the kanamycin resistance gene was a gift from Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Department of Biotechnology (Basel, Switzerland). The plasmid copy numbers determined were 80 copies of pK18 and pUC18 and 5 copies of pBBR1MCS-2 per cell in E. coli. For overexpression and purification of TeiR, E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS together with plasmid pET15b from Novagen was used. The tac promoter (274 bp) was obtained by BamHI digestion from plasmid pHA10, which was a gift from H. Arai (32Arai H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2431-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). With plasmid pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO (Invitrogen), a TeiR-GFP fusion protein was prepared, and plasmid pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) served for PCR cloning of teiR fragments and sequencing. Growth Media and Growth Conditions—Bacterial cells were grown in a shaker (180 rpm) in Standard I Nutrient broth medium (Merck) or LB medium at 37 °C (E. coli) or 27 °C (C. testosteroni). Growth media contained 60 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Restriction Enzymes and Other Reagents—Restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, S1 nuclease, and shrimp alkaline phosphatase were obtained from Roche Applied Science, New England Biolabs, MBI, Promega, and Amersham Biosciences, and used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate was from Fluka. The steroid compounds were supplied by Sigma. Ampicillin and kanamycin were from Appli-Chem and Calbiochem, respectively. [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]GTP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. DNA Manipulations—Recombinant DNA work was carried out following standard techniques according to Sambrook and Russel (33Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York2001Google Scholar). The fragments cloned in this work are shown in Fig. 1. All of the primers were prepared by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). Before further cloning, fragments prepared by PCR were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and then checked for correct sequence by MWG. Transformation of Bacteria—All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis of the resulting band patterns. Plasmids were purified with the Tip-100 kit from Qiagen. Ligated constructs were transferred into competent E. coli or C. testosteroni cells prepared by the calcium chloride or electroporation method. Double plasmid cotransformations were performed by exploiting the kanamycin resistance gene of pBBR1MCS-2 or pK18 and the ampicillin resistance gene of pUC18. In these cases, both antibiotics were added to the culture medium. Plasmid isolation and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed to prove successful double transformations. Cloning of the teiR Gene from C. testosteroni and Subcloning of teiR Gene Fragments—The teiR gene was cloned from C. testosteroni (ATCC 11996) chromosomal DNA by using the following pair of primers: forward primer 5′-CGAGCTCCATCGCTTGCGTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCGGCCGCTCTATGCCCG-3′ (30Pruneda-Paz J.L. Linares M. Cabrera J.E. Genti-Raimondi S. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1430-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The full teiR gene was then cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO to yield plasmid pTOPO4, which after sequence confirmation (MWG) was used as template for further PCR reactions (Fig. 1A). To generate pKteiR10, forward primer 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTGCCCATATTTCGAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGAATTCTCGAATCACTTGTTCCCCAGC-3′ were used in a PCR reaction with plasmid pTOPO4 as template, and the resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and introduced into pK18 downstream from the lacZ promoter. After sequence confirmation, the same fragment was digested by NdeI and XhoI and introduced into pET-15b downstream from the N-terminal His tag coding sequence to yield pET-TeiR1. To obtain the TeiR-GFP fusion plasmid pBBtac-teir-GFP1, forward primer 5′-CTAGCTAGCATGTGCCCATATTTCGAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TAGCTAGCCTTGTTCCCCAGCCAGGC-3′ were used in a PCR reaction with pTOPO4 as template. The resulting fragment was digested with NheI and cloned into pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO to yield pcGFP-teiR (not shown). After digestion with XbaI, pcGFP-teiR was introduced into pBBR1MCS-2 under the control of the tac promotor. Plasmids pKteiRA, pKteiRB, and pKteiRC, which harbor different fragments of the TeiR gene, were obtained by partial digestion with PstI and identification by restriction fragment analysis. Plasmid pBBtacIII was generated by producing a PCR fragment with forward primer 5′-TCCCCCCGGGATGACCGAAGGCATG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCACTTGTTCCCCA-3′ and plasmid pTOPO4 as template. The resulting fragment was digested with XmaI and HindIII and ligated into pBBR1MCS-2. Plasmid pBBtacIV was obtained by two-step PCR. In the first PCR forward primer 5′-TCCCCCCGGGATGTGCCCATATTTCGAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATCTGTCGGTGAAC CGTCTGTCGATGAC-3′ were used with template plasmid pTOPO4 to generate a fragment that was used as forward primer for the second PCR. The latter was used in combination with reverse primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCACTTGTTCCCCA-3′ to yield a fragment that was digested with XmaI and HindIII and ligated into pBBR1MCS-2. N-terminal deleted constructs were produced by PCR, digested with XmaI and HindIII, and cloned into vectors pCR2.1-TOPO or pK18. Primers for yielding pTOPON5teiR (not shown) or pKN5teiR were forward primer 5′-TCCCCCCGGGATGCCTACCGACCGTATCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCACTTGTTCCCCA-3′, and primers for yielding pTOPON8teiR (not shown) or pKN8teiR were forward primer 5′-TCCCCCCGGGATGATGCTGCCGCACATC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCACTTGTTCCCCA-3′. Plasmids pKteiR627 and pKteiR567, bearing C-terminal-deleted fragments of teiR, were constructed by standard PCR and cloned into pK18 via XmaI and HindIII restriction sites. Primers for pKteiR627 were forward primer 5′-TCCCCCCGGGATGTGCCCATATTTCGAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCAATCGAGGATGACCAC-3′, and primers for pKteiR567 were forward primer 5′-TCCCCCCGGGATGTGCCCATATTTCGAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CATTGCCGTTCTGAAGCTTCTGACGATCCTGG-3′. An additional fragment between teiR sequence 627 bp and 1176 bp (including a HindIII restriction site) was received by PCR (forward primer 5′-GGATCGTCAGAAGCTTCAGAACGGCAATGTG-3′; reverse primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCACTTGTTCCCCA-3′) and cloned into pKteiR567 to yield pKteiRdY. Generation of teiR Gene Knockout Mutants of C. testosteroni—Two different teiR knock-out mutants of C. testosteroni were prepared by homologous integration (Fig. 1B). For knock-out mutant teiRkoI, plasmid pTOPO-teiR14 (not shown) was generated by PCR using forward primer 5′-CGGAATTCAGGCCGACCGCCGCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGGAATTCACGGCGACCGCTGGGG-3′, both containing an additional cytosine (underlined), against pTOPO4. The resulting fragment harboring a frameshift mutation within the teiR gene was digested with EcoRI and cloned into pK18 to yield pKPCR. For knockout mutant teiRkoII, a PstI fragment (384–750 bp) was isolated after PstI digestion of pTOPO4 and cloned into pK18 to yield pKteiR5. Because of its sensitivity to kanamycin, C. testosteroni can only grow after homologous integration of the kanamycin resistance gene from pK18, which on the other hand, cannot replicate as a plasmid in C. testosteroni. Accordingly, 10 μg of the pK18 descendent pKPCR or pKteiR5 plasmids, which also contain teiR sequences homologous to C. testosteroni chromosomal DNA, were transformed into C. testosteroni by electroporation (1.8 kV, 1-mm cuvette, Bio-Rad). The cells were cultured in 0.4 ml of SIN medium at 27 °C for 3 h (110 rpm). The culture was spread on 30 μg/ml kanamycin SIN agar plates and cultured in a 27 °C incubator overnight. Only cells with pKPCR or pKteiR5 integrated into the chromosomal DNA could grow in the kanamycin-containing medium. Total DNA from the colonies was isolated and checked for knock-out mutations by Southern blot hybridization. Subcloning of the 3α-HSD/CR Gene—As described previously, a 5.257-kilobase EcoRI fragment of C. testosteroni chromosomal DNA was cloned into pUC18 (ampicillin-resistant) to yield p6 (29Xiong G. Martin H.J. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47400-47407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmid p6 contains the 3α-HSD/CR gene, hsdA, together with its regulatory region and including the two repressor genes repA and repB (28Xiong G. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Xiong G. Martin H.J. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47400-47407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The expression of hsdA served as a detection system for TeiR-dependent steroid regulation in cotransformation experiments with plasmid p6. Preparation and Purification of Recombinant TeiR Protein—Overexpression of TeiR was performed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS and plasmid pET15b (Novagen), and the recombinant protein was purified by its His-tag sequence. Cells transformed with plasmid pET-TeiR1 (Fig. 1A) were grown at 37 °C in a shaker (180 rpm), and maintenance of plasmids was ensured by adding 60 μg/ml ampicillin to the culture medium. 100 μl of a culture grown overnight was used to inoculate 3 ml of fresh medium. At an A595 of 0.6, expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 4 h cells were sedimented by centrifugation. The cell pellet was either stored at -80 °C for further usage or directly suspended in 200 μl of buffer B (100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea, pH 8.0) (Qiagen). Cells were lysed by freezing (-20 °C, 30 min) and thawing (room temperature, 30 min) 3 times, and the resulting mixture was centrifuged (20 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C). The supernatant was applied to a mini nickel-agarose affinity column (Qiagen). After washing 2 times with 600 μl of buffer C (100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea, pH 6.3) (Qiagen) and washing one time with washing buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm imidazole, 1% sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, pH 8.0), TeiR was eluted from the column by applying 100 μl of elution buffer 4 times (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm sodium chloride, 250 mm imidazole, 1% sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, pH 8.0). Samples containing pure and soluble TeiR protein, as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2), were used to prepare antibodies, to determine steroid binding specificity, and to prove TeiR kinase activities. Protein Determination—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Protein analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Electroblotting was performed in a semidry blotting system. After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL PLUS-detection system, Amersham Biosciences). For GFP detection, membranes were incubated with primary antisera against GFP (raised in mice) in a dilution of 1:2000 for1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody (peroxidase conjugated gout anti-mouse immunoglobulin) was used in a 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After 4 × TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) (Roche Diagnostics) washing, 2 ml of fluorescence reagent was spread on the membranes, covered with plastic membranes, and exposed to x-ray films. Laser-scanning Microscopy—C. testosteroni and E. coli cells from the late log-phase and expressing the GFP-TeiR fusion protein (after pBBtac-teiR-GFP1 transformation) were taken and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were illuminated with an argon laser (488 nm for detection of GFP fluorescence) and recorded using a Leica TCS SP1 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Swimming and Twitching Motility Assay—Swimming and twitching activities of C. testosteroni wild type and teiR knockout mutants were assayed by the agar stab method. For swimming, C. testosteroni wild type and teiRkoI knock-out cells (5 μl) were inoculated onto 0.3% agar plates. Testosterone was stab-spotted (5 μl of 1 mm each) into the agar surface in some distance to the bacterial inoculates. For twitching, bacterial cells (5 μl) were inoculated in a line onto 0.5% agar plates. Testosterone was stab-spotted (5 μl of 1 mm each) into the agar surface in increasing distances to the bacterial inoculates. After 2 days of incubation at 27 °C, the size of the swimming and twitching zones around the bacterial inoculation site at the interface to the testosterone spots was determined. Testosterone Binding and Degradation—To test the [3H]testosterone binding activities, wild type and teiR knock-out mutant cells of C. testosteroni were grown overnight and then diluted to an A595 of 1.0 with water. An aliquot of 400 μl was taken and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 s and resuspended in 100 μl of water. For preparation of the bacterial membranes, 1 μl of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min, and the pellet containing the membranes was resuspended in 100 μl of water. In the testosterone binding assay, 10 μl of intact cells were mixed with 0.4 × TEN buffer (10 × TEN buffer: 1 m NaCl, 0.01 m EDTA, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and 0.1 μl of [3H]testosterone (1 mCi/ml) to a final volume of 20 μl. After incubation times of 5 min or 30 min at 27 °C, the incubates were transferred onto 1-cm2 pieces of Whatman No. 3MM paper. The pieces were put on Whatman No. 3MM stripes by adhesion and continuously rinsed by gravity with a solvent containing 0.2 × TEN and 0.3% Tween. After 3 h of washing, the 1-cm2 pieces were dried at 37 °C for 1 h and mixed with 3 ml of scintillation solution, and [3H]testosterone measured as cpm in a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac 1409; machine efficiency = 35%). The same procedure was performed to analyze the testosterone binding capabilities of teiR gene deletion mutants that were expressed in E. coli to identify the steroid binding domain within the TeiR protein. For measuring the testosterone uptake activities, C. testosteroni wild type cells and teiR knock-out mutants were cultured in 1 ml of SIN medium. After an A595 nm of 0.6 was reached, 1 μCi (1 μl) of [3H]testosterone was added to the medium, and the cells allowed to grow for up to 3 h. Cells were harvested, and [3H]testosterone was measured in the remaining culture medium as described above. Protein Extraction—The probes for 3α-HSD/CR ELISA detection were prepared from 3 ml of bacterial cell culture and subsequent centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 s. The pellet was washed 3 times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 100 μg/ml lysozyme. To"
https://openalex.org/W2038756082,"Increased synthesis of NO during airway inflammation, caused by induction of nitric-oxide synthase 2 in several lung cell types, may contribute to epithelial injury and permeability. To investigate the consequence of elevated NO production on epithelial function, we exposed cultured monolayers of human bronchial epithelial cells to the NO donor diethylenetriaamine NONOate. At concentrations generating high nanomolar levels of NO, representative of inflammatory conditions, diethylenetriaamine NONOate markedly reduced wound closure in an in vitro scratch injury model, primarily by inhibiting epithelial cell migration. Analysis of signaling pathways and gene expression profiles indicated a rapid induction of the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MPK)-1 and decrease in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activation, as well as marked stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and activation of hypoxia-responsive genes, under these conditions. Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling using U0126 enhanced HIF-1alpha stabilization, implicating ERK1/2 dephosphorylation as a contributing mechanism in NO-mediated HIF-1alpha activation. Activation of HIF-1alpha by the hypoxia mimic cobalt chloride, or cell transfection with a degradation-resistant HIF-1alpha mutant construct inhibited epithelial wound repair, implicating HIF-1alpha in NO-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Conversely, NO-mediated inhibition of epithelial wound closure was largely prevented after small interfering RNA suppression of HIF-1alpha. Finally, NO-mediated inhibition of cell migration was associated with HIF-1alpha-dependent induction of PAI-1 and activation of p53, both negative regulators of epithelial cell migration. Collectively, our results demonstrate that inflammatory levels of NO inhibit epithelial cell migration, because of suppression of ERK1/2 signaling, and activation of HIF-1alpha and p53, with potential consequences for epithelial repair and remodeling during airway inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2022287626,"Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by different isoforms of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) and operates as a mediator of important cell signaling pathways, such as the cGMP signaling cascade. Another mechanism by which NO exerts biological effects is mediated through S-nitrosation of target proteins. To explore thiol-based protein modifications in a situation of defined nitrosative stress, we used a transgenic mouse model with cardiac specific overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and concomitant myoglobin deficiency (iNOS+/myo-/-). In comparison with the wild type hearts, protein glutathiolation detected by immunoblotting was significantly enhanced in iNOS+/myo-/- hearts, whereas protein S-nitrosation as measured by the biotin switch assay and two-dimensional PAGE revealed that nearly all of the detected proteins (∼60) remained unchanged with the exception of three proteins. Tandem mass spectrometry revealed these proteins to be peroxiredoxins (Prxs), which are known to possess peroxidase activity, whereby hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and a wide range of organic hydroperoxides are reduced and detoxified. Immunoblotting with specific antibodies revealed up-regulation of Prx VI in the iNOS+/myo-/- hearts, whereas expression of Prx II and Prx III remained unchanged. Furthermore, the analysis of the cardiac S-nitrososubproteome identified several new proteins possibly being involved in NO-signaling pathways. Our data indicate that S-nitrosation and glutathiolation of cardiac proteins may contribute to the phenotype of NO-induced heart failure.

Cardiol. 2006; 21: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To fulfill these diverse functions in the heart, NO is synthesized by different nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isozymes, whereby the constitutively expressed endothelial NOS and neuronal NOS isozymes are restricted to defined subcellular microdomains requiring calcium and calmodulin for their activation. The expression of inducible NOS (iNOS) is stimulated in response to inflammation and cytokine production also in cardiomyocytes (3Kan H. Xie Z. Finkel M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1641-H1646PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison with the other isozymes, the activation of iNOS is calcium/calmodulin-independent, and larger quantities of NO are produced. Although iNOS releases high levels of NO, which in cardiac myocytes is known to induce apoptosis (4Taimor G. Rakow A. Piper H.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2518-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), inhibit the respiratory chain (5Kelm M. Schafer S. Dahmann R. Dolu B. Perings S. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Strauer B.E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 36: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and induce a negative inotropic effect even under basal conditions (6Kojda G. Kottenberg K. Nix P. Schluter K.D. Piper H.M. Noack E. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), transgenic mice with cardiospecific overexpression of iNOS do not develop heart failure (7Heger J.

Res. 2002; 90: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), calling into question the concept that cardiac iNOS induction may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of heart failure (8de Belder A.J. Radomski M.W. Why H.J. Richardson P.J. Martin J.F. Br. Heart J. 1995; 74: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, double mutants with cardiac specific iNOS overexpression and concomitant myoglobin deficiency (iNOS+/myo-/-) develop signs of heart failure with cardiac hypertrophy, ventricular dilatation, and interstitial fibrosis accompanied by functional depression, such as reduced contractility, ejection fraction, and cardiac energetics (9Godecke A. Molojavyi A. Heger J. Flogel U. Ding Z. Jacoby C. Schrader J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21761-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings underscore the ability of myoglobin to efficiently metabolize NO in vivo (10Flogel U. Merx M.W. Godecke A. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). On the molecular level, NO and NO-derived species exert their biological actions by chemical modification of target molecules, preferentially interacting with transition metals, thiol groups, and free radicals. One well known signaling pathway of NO is initiated by reaction of NO with heme iron of soluble guanylate cyclase, leading to increased cGMP accumulation and kinase activation. Binding of NO to other heme proteins, such as NOS, and cytochrome c oxidase competes with oxygen and regulates NO synthesis as well as oxygen consumption by the mitochondria. Another important mechanism in the signaling of NO and NO-derived species is mediated through the reaction with thiols. Protein thiols and GSH react with NO derivatives to produce a range of products, including S-nitrosothiols, disulfides, and sulfenic, sulfinic, and sulfonic acids (11Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Padgett C.M. Whorton A.R. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 27: 157-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In this context, S-nitrosation of protein thiols has gained particular interest because it may enable a reversible regulation of protein function as well as contribute to nitrosative stress, and a growing number of proteins have been found to undergo S-nitrosation in vivo, resulting in functional consequences (14Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 15Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The possible impact of S-nitrosation in mediating cardiac effects of NO in a situation of nitrosative stress is largely unknown. The identification of S-nitrosated proteins in a mixture of cellular proteins is generally done by application of the biotin switch method (16Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). This proteomic approach selectively converts nitrosated cysteines into biotinylated ones, so that the proteins can subsequently be purified by avidin affinity chromatography or identified by immunoblotting. Although the specificity of the biotin switch method has recently been challenged (17Landino L.M. Koumas M.T. Mason C.E. Alston J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Huang B. Chen C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), comprehensive evaluation performed by Stamler and his group (19Forrester M.T. Foster M.W. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13977-13983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) confirmed that the method is highly selective for S-nitrosated proteins. Here, we report the identification of S-nitrosated proteins from the in vivo mouse heart under conditions of nitrosative stress. By application of the biotin switch method, coupled to two-dimensional PAGE and MS analysis, we identified novel protein targets of S-nitrosation and found specific peroxiredoxins to be differentially S-nitrosated using the iNOS+/myo-/- mutant mouse as a model. In addition, we observed a significant increase in protein glutathiolation upon increased nitrosative stress. Together our data suggest both S-nitrosation and glutathiolation to be of functional relevance in a situation of nitrosative stress. Materials and Reagents—GSH, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), diethylamine NONOate (DeaNONOate), and spermine NONOate were purchased from Calbiochem. Ascorbate, HEPES, Tris, SDS, TEMED, CHAPS, DMSO, DTT, iodoacetamide, diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide adduct (DETA/NO), and protease inhibitor mixture were obtained from Sigma. EDTA was from ICN Biomedicals. Biotin-HPDP, BCA protein assay, and biotinylated SDS-PAGE standard were from Pierce. ReadyStrip IPG strips, pH 3–10, and Bio-Lyte 3-10 Ampholyte were from Bio-Rad.

Acetonitrile was from Riedel de Haen, and acrylamide-bis solution was from Serva Electrophoresis. Silver nitrate was obtained from Roth. Animals—This study was approved by the local government committee and conducted according to national animal care legislation. Transgenic mice with cardiac specific iNOS-overexpression (iNOS+) and concomitant myoglobin deficiency (iNOS+/myo-/-) were generated as described previously (7Heger J. Godecke A. Flogel U. Merx M.W. Molojavyi A. Kuhn-Velten W.N. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Godecke A. Molojavyi A. Heger J. Flogel U. Ding Z. Jacoby C. Schrader J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21761-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation—After being intubated and anesthetized by mechanical ventilation with isoflurane (1.5% v/v), mice were thoracotomized, and a 23-gauge cannula was inserted into the left ventricular cavity. The heart was immediately perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline at a rate of 3 ml/min, whereby aortic root and pulmonary artery were cross-clamped, and the right ventricle was concomitantly cut off to enable perfusate outflow. After ∼10 s, when the heart turned pale and stopped beating, it was rapidly excised, transferred to a beaker with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline for rinsing off residual blood, and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The whole procedure lasted 30–40 s. Heart samples were stored at -80 °C for proteomic analysis. Detection of Protein S-Nitrosothiols by Biotin Switch Assay—S-Nitrosated proteins were detected using the biotin switch assay as described by Jaffrey and Snyder (20Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : L1Google Scholar). In brief, in the first step of this assay, free thiols were blocked by incubation with thiol-specific methylthiolating agent MMTS. After blocking of free thiols, nitrosothiols were selectively decomposed with ascorbate. The newly formed thiols were finally reacted with biotin-HPDP, a sulfhydryl-specific biotinylating reagent. Labeled proteins could be detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against biotin or purified using Neutravidin, a biotin-binding protein. The entire biotin switch assay was always carried out in the dark. The whole procedure, including minor modifications made, is given in detail below. To detect labeled proteins by immunoblotting, hearts were homogenized in HEN buffer (250 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm neocuproine, pH 7.7) with a glass homogenizer, the homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was adjusted to a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. After adding 0.4% CHAPS, the samples were incubated with NO donors (n = 2/group) for 1 h at 25 °C.80 μl of each lysate was loaded on a Micro Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated with HEN buffer and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 4 min. This desalting step was repeated two more times using freshly equilibrated columns. 7.5 μl of 25% SDS and 1.5 μl of MMTS (20% (v/v) in N,N-dimethylformamide) were added to 75 μl of eluate, and the free thiols were blocked at 50 °C for 20 min. MMTS was removed by desalting with three successive Micro Bio-Spin 6 columns previously equilibrated with HEN. Finally, biotin-HPDP (4 mm in DMSO) and ascorbate (600 mm) were added to the eluate to give a final concentration of 1 mm biotin-HPDP and 30 mm ascorbate. This mixture was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, after which 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (without reducing agent) (Rotiload; Roth) was added. After SDS-PAGE, biotinylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Purification of S-Nitrosated Proteins—Purification of S-nitrosated proteins was performed using neutravidin-agarose (Pierce) following the biotin switch assay. For preparative purposes, one mouse heart was homogenized in HENS (2Saraiva R.M. Hare J.M. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 2006; 21: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) buffer (2% (w/v) SDS in HEN) containing 40 mm MMTS with a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min to block free thiols. To remove MMTS, proteins were precipitated at -20 °C for 1 h with ice-cold acetone and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein pellet was washed with ice-cold 80% acetone in HENS (1% (w/v) SDS in HEN) to remove remaining MMTS. This washing step was found to be indispensable. Otherwise, the remaining MMTS competes with the biotin-HPDP in the next step and significantly lowers the yield of protein biotinylation. The protein pellet was recovered in 0.1 ml of HENS buffer/mg of protein in the starting sample. Biotin-HPDP (1 mm) and ascorbate (30 mm) were added to the protein solution, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Proteins were then precipitated and washed with ice-cold acetone as mentioned before. The protein pellet was resuspended in HENS buffer, and two volumes of neutralization buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.7) were added. To remove small amounts of unsuspended material, the sample was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated with neutravidin-agarose for 1 h at 25 °C. Next, the resin was transferred into empty columns (Micro Bio-Spin chromatography columns; Bio-Rad) and washed 10 times with one volume of washing buffer (20 mm Hepes, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.7) and three times with one volume of neutralization buffer. Samples, which were prepared for two-dimensional PAGE analysis, were additionally washed four times with one volume of 0.5% CHAPS. Remaining proteins bound to the resin were reductively eluted by incubation with elution buffer for SDS-PAGE (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.7) or two-dimensional PAGE (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 100 mm DTT) for 30 min at 36 °C followed by centrifugation. The eluate was collected for proteomic studies. For detection and identification of endogenously S-nitrosated proteins in WT and iNOS+/myo-/- mouse hearts, four samples per group were analyzed. Two-dimensional PAGE—Isoelectric focusing was performed using the Ettan IPGphor system (GE Healthcare) with 17-cm ReadyStrip IPG strips, pH 3–10 (Bio-Rad). According to the protein estimation, appropriate volumes of the protein samples obtained after the biotin switch assay were diluted with rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 20 mm DTT, traces of bromphenol blue), whereas the sample with the lowest protein content served as the reference to which the other samples were adjusted. Then 1% Bio-Lyte pH 3–10 ampholyte was added, and each sample (313 μl) was loaded onto an IPG strip and in-gel rehydrated for 14 h at 20 °C. The focusing was started at 500 V for 1 h (step and hold) and 1000 V for 1 h (gradient), followed by linearly ramping to 8000 V over 3 h and keeping 8000 V for 3.5 h (step and hold). After isoelectric focusing, the strips were immediately stored at -80 °C or incubated for 15 min in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, traces of bromphenol blue) containing 1% DTT and for an additional 15 min in the same buffer containing 2.5% iodoacetamide instead of DTT. Equilibrated IPG strips were washed in electrophoresis buffer, placed on top of a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and fixed with agarose sealing solution (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.5% low melting agarose, traces of bromphenol blue). Second dimension electrophoresis was performed on SE 600 Ruby vertical electrophoresis units (GE Healthcare) until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. Silver Staining and Image Analysis—MS-compatible silver staining was performed according to Shevchenko et al. (21Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7803) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 5% acetic acid in water for 20 min and then washed two times for 10 min each with 50% methanol in water followed by 10 min with water. Afterwards, the gels were sensitized by a 1-min incubation in 0.02% sodium thiosulfate and then rinsed with three changes of distilled water for 30 s each. After rinsing, the gels were incubated for 20 min in 0.2% silver nitrate with 0.02% (v/v) formaldehyde. Then the staining solution was discarded, and the gels were rinsed three times with water for 30 s and developed in 3% sodium carbonate with 0.05% formaldehyde (37% in water) and 0.01 mm sodium thiosulfate for 5 min. The development was terminated by discarding the reagent, followed by washing with 5% acetic acid for 5 min. Silver-stained gels were stored in a solution of 1% acetic acid at 4 °C until analyzed. The gels were digitized at 300 dots/inch, 8-bit gray scale, blue channel using a UMAX PowerLook III scanner calibrated by a photographic step tablet (Eastman Kodak Co.). Tryptic Digestion—In-gel digestion was performed as described (21Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7803) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Initially, gels were washed twice with deionized water for 15 min. Protein spots were then excised and dehydrated in a SpeedVac. The dried pieces were destained in a 1:1 solution of 30 mm potassium ferricyanide and 100 mm sodium thiosulfate for 15 min and then washed with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate until colorless. After dehydration in a SpeedVac, reduction and alkylation of proteins was performed with 10 mm DTT in 100 mm NH4HCO3 at 56 °C for 30 min and subsequently with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm NH4HCO3 at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Then the gel pieces were washed with 100 mm NH4HCO3, dehydrated by the addition of acetonitrile, and completely dried in a SpeedVac. Ice-cold digestion buffer containing 12.5 ng/μl sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 and 5 mm CaCl2 was added, and the pieces were rehydrated on ice for 45 min. The excess buffer was removed and replaced with the same buffer without trypsin for overnight digest at 37 °C. Peptide-containing supernatants were saved, and the remaining peptides were sequentially extracted by the following steps: 1) the addition of 25 mm NH4HCO3 (10-min shaking, 5-min ultrasonic bath) followed by the addition of acetonitrile to obtain a 1:1 solution (10-min shaking, 5-min ultrasonic bath); 2) 5% acetic acid followed by the addition of acetonitrile to obtain a 1:1 solution (incubations similar to step 1); 3) repetition of step 2. All extracts were combined, vacuum-dried, and redissolved in 4% acetonitrile and 0.1% acetic acid in deionized water. Nano-LC-MS/MS Analysis—Tryptic digests were analyzed by an automated nano-LC-MS/MS system using an Ettan micro-LC system equipped with an Ettan A-905 autosampler (GE Healthcare) coupled to an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ionization source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Operation of the Ettan micro-LC system and the mass spectrometer was fully automated during the entire procedure using Unicorn 5.01 (GE Healthcare) and Xcalibur 2.0 SR2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively. Each digest solution was automatically loaded onto a ZOR-BAX 300SB-C18 reversed-phase precolumn (5 × 0.3 mm) for sample concentration and desalting at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in high pressure liquid chromatography solvent A (4% acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid). Peptide separations were performed on 75 μm × 10-cm fused silica capillary columns (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) placed in line onto a MicroTee (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA). The capillary columns were pulled with a P-2000/F laser micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) and slurry packed in house with 5-μm, 300-Å pore size C-18 silica-bonded stationary phase (YMC) by using a helium pressure cell operated at 500 p.s.i. Peptides were eluted directly into the mass spectrometer using a linear gradient from 0 to 60% B (84% acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid) over 30 min followed by an increase to 100% B for 5 min with a flow rate of 200 nl/min across the column. The electrospray voltage was set at 1.8 or 2.4 kV, and the heated capillary temperature was maintained at 160 °C. Automated data-dependent MS analysis was carried out using the dynamic exclusion feature of the Xcalibur software. Each MS full scan (m/z 400–2000) was followed by MS/MS scans of the four most intense ions (isolation width of m/z 2) detected in the preceding MS scan, whereby the collision energy for CID was set at 35 units, and a repeat count of 3 with a 5-min exclusion duration window was applied (exclusion width m/z of -1.5 to +1.5). Sequence Data Base Searching and Protein Identification—MS/MS spectra were sequence data base-searched against the nonredundant mouse International Protein Index data base (version 3.38) from the European Bioinformatics Institute containing 53,847 protein sequences using the SEQUEST algorithm. The search parameters used included trypsin specificity, two missed cleavage sites, and a precursor ion mass accuracy tolerance of 2.0 with cysteine oxidation and carboxyamidomethylation specified as differential modifications. To obtain reliable protein identification, only peptides with a minimal cross-correlation score of 1.8, 2.5, and 3.5 for charge states +1, +2, and +3, respectively, were taken into account. The ΔCN had to be >0.1. Western Analysis—After electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman and Schleicher & Schuell) and analyzed using standard Western blotting procedures. All primary antibody incubations, diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions, were performed in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibodies directed against peroxiredoxin II, peroxiredoxin III, and peroxiredoxin VI were obtained from Abcam and used to analyze basal expression levels of peroxiredoxins in WT and iNOS+/myo-/- hearts (n = 4/group). To detect glutathiolated proteins, a glutathione antibody was used (Virogen). To analyze endogenously glutathiolated proteins, whole heart homogenates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm iodoacetamide, 1% SDS, 1% protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4. Peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-biotin (clone BN-34) IgG to detect biotinylated proteins in samples from the biotin switch assay was from Sigma. After incubation with primary antibodies, blots were washed six times for 5–10 min each before secondary antibodies were added. Incubations with secondary antibodies were performed in 5% dry milk solution in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween at room temperature for 1.5 h. The peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. After extensive washing, the blots were developed with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Optimization of the Biotin Switch Assay—The conversion of nitrosated cysteines into biotinylated cysteines requires the reduction of the S-nitrosothiols by ascorbate to form thiols. Therefore, the efficiency of this reaction will essentially determine the sensitivity of the biotin switch assay. To optimize the conditions for mouse heart samples and to test whether the sensitivity could further be enhanced, ascorbate concentrations of 1 or 30 mm and incubation times of 1 and 3 h were tested, respectively. Heart homogenates were treated with the natural NO donor GSNO or the control compound GSH and then subjected to the biotin switch assay. The intensity of the Western blot signals displays a positive correlation to the concentration of ascorbate as well as the incubation time for the GSNO-treated homogenate (supplemental Fig. 1). Because a maximum increase in efficiency of biotinylation was observed with 30 mm ascorbate at a 1-h incubation time, these conditions were applied for further experiments. S-Nitrosation Induced by Different NO Donors—NO donors vary in their mode of NO release, which consequently can affect their ability to S-nitrosate proteins. Data depicted in Fig. 1 clearly show that in the mouse heart homogenate, GSNO and SNAP result in far more S-nitrosation than DeaNONOate, which only slightly increased protein S-nitrosation. DETA/NO and spermine NONOate did not increase S-nitrosation above the control level. Since similar results were obtained for DeaNONOate, DETA/NO, and spermine NONOate with half-lifes ranging from 16 to 230 min and 20 h, respectively, the different lifetimes of these donors are seemingly of less relevance for the observation. In contrast to GSNO and SNAP, the other NO donors are not capable to efficiently perform transnitrosation reactions, by which a nitrosonium (NO+) is transferred to another thiol. Thus, under the in vitro conditions used, transnitrosation seems to be the favorable reaction mechanism for protein S-nitrosation. S-Nitrosation and S-Glutathiolation of Protein Sulfhydryls by GSNO—GSNO has attracted increasing interest in recent years for its dual ability to S-nitrosate and S-glutathiolate proteins (13Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 22Konorev E.A. Kalyanaraman B. Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1671-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate which of these modifications dominates in a mixture of proteins derived from a mouse heart homogenate, samples were incubated with GSNO and examined by application of the biotin switch method (Fig. 2) and use of an antibody directed against S-glutathiolated proteins (PSSG) (Fig. 3). GSNO caused a marked increase in protein S-nitrosation over control samples, as evident from a comparison of the derivatized a"

Glutathione S-transferase (GST) A4-4 is recognized as one of the predominant enzymes responsible for the metabolism of HNE. However, substrate and product stereoselectivity remain to be fully explored. The results from a product formation assay indicate that hGSTA4-4 exhibits a modest preference for the biotransformation of S-HNE in the presence of both enantiomers. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analyses using the racemic and enantioisomeric HNE substrates explicitly demonstrate that hGSTA4-4 conjugates glutathione to both HNE enantiomers in a completely stereoselective manner that is not maintained in the spontaneous reaction. Compared with other hGST isoforms, hGSTA4-4 shows the highest degree of stereoselectivity. NMR experiments in combination with simulated annealing structure determinations enabled the determination of stereochemical configurations for the GSHNE diastereomers and are consistent with an hGSTA4-4-catalyzed nucleophilic attack that produces only the S-configuration at the site of conjugation, regardless of substrate chirality. In total these results indicate that hGSTA4-4 exhibits an intriguing combination of low substrate stereoselectivity with strict product stereoselectivity.

This behavior allows for the detoxification of both HNE enantiomers while generating only a select set of GSHNE diastereomers with potential stereochemical implications concerning their effects and fates in biological tissues. Stereochemical configuration is a fundamental aspect of molecular structure, and the functional consequences of dynamic stereochemistry in biology are well established (1Burke D. Henderson D.J. Br.

Substrate stereoselectivity may occur in enzyme-mediated catalysis by virtue of the innate asymmetry of the active site. Product stereoselectivity may also arise when new chiral centers are introduced during an enzymatic reaction, because enzymes may specifically stabilize only one of the possible transition states for a given reaction. Stereoselective metabolism of both xenobiotic and endogenous molecules is a well recognized phenomenon that reflects this underlying chiral recognition process. To the extent that stereochemically distinct substrates and products have different biological effects, it is essential to define the stereochemical course of enzymatic reactions. Among the molecules generated endogenously from the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids during lipid peroxidation, the unsaturated aldehyde 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) 2The abbreviations used are: HNE, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSHNE, glutathionyl 4-hydroxynonanal; GSDHN, glutathionyl 1,4-dihydroxynonanol; TNBS, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; ROESY, rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; LC/MS, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. has been implicated in a variety of pathological states associated with the deleterious consequences of oxidative stress, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease (7Hu W.

HNE has been proposed to exert a number of toxicological effects via its electrophilic α,β–unsaturated carbonyl moiety that can react through additions with nucleophiles such as cysteine, histidine, and lysine residues (12Carini M. Aldini G. Facino R.M. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2004; 23: 281-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Schaur R.J. Mol.

HNE is also involved in modulating a variety of signaling cascades related to proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (15West J.D. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2005; 18: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Yang Y. Sharma R. Sharma A. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2003; 50: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, stereochemical aspects of many of these processes have not been established. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) comprise a family of multifunctional enzymes known to catalyze the conjugation of the tripeptide γ-Glu-Cys-Gly (GSH) with xenobiotic and endogenous electrophiles including HNE (17Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 18Hayes J.D. Flanagan J.U. Jowsey I.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 51-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). The GSTs have several roles, including detoxification of endogenous compounds, drug metabolism, and antioxidant functions. In general, the A class GSTs are known to play a vital role in detoxification of oxidative stress products (19Zhao T. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19220-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, although the GSTA1-1 isoform is regarded as a highly promiscuous enzyme, GSTA4-4 is distinguished by a striking specificity toward HNE and related alkenal substrates (21Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Bruns C.M. Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol.

The discrepancy between specificities in these structurally related GST isoforms has been attributed to a relatively small number of amino acid substitutions and differences in protein dynamics within the constraints of a conserved scaffold. Conjugation to GSH has been identified as the primary route of HNE detoxification followed by oxidative/reductive modifications and, ultimately, mercapturic acid formation (25Alary J. Debrauwer L. Fernandez Y. Cravedi J.P. Rao D. Bories G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Alary J. Gueraud F. Cravedi J.P. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 159: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although HNE can spontaneously react with GSH to form a conjugate (GSHNE), GSTs have been found to significantly enhance the rate of this 1,4-addition reaction (see Fig. 1) (14Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar, 29Alin P. Danielson U.H. Mannervik B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). GSTA4-4 is recognized as one of the predominant isoforms responsible for the conjugation of HNE and GSH. Other GSTs in the A, P, and M classes can also contribute to the metabolism of HNE, albeit with significantly reduced activity (19Zhao T. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J.

Lipid peroxidation generates both enantiomers of HNE; however, monoclonal antibodies that enantioselectively recognized histidine adducts of R-or S-HNE indicated they had different intracellular localizations in the renal cortex of rats exposed to a carcinogen (31Hashimoto M. Sibata T. Wasada H. Toyokuni S. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5044-5051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hiratsuka et al. (32Hiratsuka A. Hirose K. Saito H. Watabe T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the S-HNE enantiomer irreversibly inactivated rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase at a greater rate than R-HNE. They also found a stereoselective consumption of substrate by rat GSTA4-4 in the order of S-HNE > racemic HNE > R-HNE (33Hiratsuka A. Tobita K. Saito H. Sakamoto Y. Nakano H. Ogura K. Nishiyama T. Watabe T. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 237-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a separate study by Boon et al. (28Boon P.J. Marinho H.S. Oosting R. Mulder G.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 159: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) speculated that product stereoselectivity on behalf of GSTs is one potential explanation for the unequal distribution of GSHNE diastereomers observed in rat liver cytosol. Chirality has also been implicated as an important factor in other enzymes, such as aldehyde-dehydrogenase and aldo-keto reductases, that can also contribute to HNE metabolism and subsequent biotransformations of GSHNE (34Brichac J.

Further work is needed to adequately characterize factors that contribute to the unique roles of the HNE and GSHNE stereoisomers. Previously, the stereoselectivity of human GSTA4-4 (hGSTA4-4) had not been explicitly determined. Two stereochemical processes catalyzed by GSTs have not been completely understood: the relative preference for R-HNE versus S-HNE, which we refer to as substrate stereoselectivity, and the stereochemical course of GSH addition to the prochiral carbon 3 position, which we refer to as product stereoselectivity. Herein we report that hGSTA4-4 is modestly substrate selective, with a preference for the biotransformation of S-HNE in the presence of both enantiomers. Furthermore, for each enantiomeric substrate, hGSTA4-4 conjugates GSH to HNE with complete product stereoselectivity that is not maintained in the spontaneous reaction. NMR analyses were used to characterize the GSHNE diastereomers, and the stereoselectivity of hGSTA4-4 was also compared with other hGST isoforms as well as rationally designed mutants. These results reveal that hGSTA4-4 is unique in its combination of high catalytic efficiency for both HNE enantiomers with a strict product stereoselectivity that yields specific GSHNE diastereomers. Protein Expression and Purification—Human recombinant GSTA4-4 was expressed as an ubiquitin fusion co-translationally cleaved by a co-expressed ubiquitin-specific protease in Escherichia coli and purified via glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (21Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The subunit concentration was determined by the Edelhoch method (37Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar) using ϵ = 15930 m-1 cm-1 for denatured hGSTA4-4. Human recombinant GSTA1-1 and P1-1 were expressed and purified in a manner similar to that described previously (38Lu W.D. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12761-12769Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The human GSTA4-4 F111V/Y217R and GSTA1-1 V111F/R217Y mutants were constructed using overlap extension PCR as described previously (23Hou L. Honaker M.T. Shireman L.M. Balogh L.M. Roberts A.G. Ng K.C. Nath A. Atkins W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23264-23274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). R- and S-HNE—Racemic HNE purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI) was dried at room temperature and reconstituted in a mixture of 98:2 n-hexane:isopropanol. The enantiomers were separated by normal phase HPLC on a chiral column (Chiralcel OB; 250 × 4.6 mm, 10-micron particle size; Chiral Technologies, West Chester, PA) eluted with an isocratic mobile phase of n-hexane/isopropanol 98.7/1.3 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (32Hiratsuka A. Hirose K. Saito H. Watabe T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The S- and R-HNE enantiomers eluting at 19 and 22 min, respectively, were collected, evaporated in a dark fume hood, and reconstituted in absolute ethyl alcohol (USP grade). The fractions were checked for purity by reinjection, and the concentrations were determined from absorption at 224 nm using ϵ = 13750 m-1 cm-1 for HNE in water. Stock solutions were stored in ethanol at -80 °C. Stereoselectivity Analysis—The diastereomeric GSHNE conjugates were prepared by spontaneous or enzymatic reactions of GSH with HNE. GSH (500 μm) was preincubated with either hGSTA4-4 (3 μm), hGSTA1-1 (33 μm), hGSTP1-1 (33 μm), or buffer alone (100 mm NaPO4, pH 6.6) at 30 °C followed by reaction with racemic or R-or S-HNE (250 μm) for 3 min. Diastereomer formation was analyzed by LC/MS as described below. Enzyme Kinetics—The metabolism of HNE (0–150 μm) by hGSTA4-4 (600 pm) in the presence of 1 mm GSH and 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, was monitored by product formation. GSH was preincubated with or without hGSTA4-4 in a plate format at 30 °C. Stock HNE solutions (0.5–150 mm in ethanol) were diluted into the appropriate amount of buffer, and reactions were initiated by the addition of HNE to the hGSTA4-4-GSH solutions (1% final ethanol v/v) to produce the final concentrations listed above. After 50 s, 200 μl of each reaction was quenched with 50 μl of a cold acetic acid:methanol (20:80 v/v) solution containing 5 μm caffeine as an internal standard. GSHNE diastereomer formation was analyzed by LC/MS (m/z 464) as described below. The data points represent the averages of duplicate assays and have been corrected for the corresponding spontaneous reaction. The standard curves were generated from known amounts of purified GSHNE diluted to the same extent with quench solution. Kinetic constants were determined by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Preparation of the GSHNE Diastereomers—GSHNE was synthesized by incubating HNE with excess GSH. The resulting diastereomers were separated by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column (Econosphere C18; 250 × 10 mm; Alltech, Deerfield, IL) eluted with an isocratic mobile phase of 16% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The fractions were collected and analyzed by LC/MS as described below, and the appropriate fractions were pooled. This process was repeated until sufficient amounts of the diastereomers were obtained for NMR analysis or use in a standard curve. A Rotavap was used to remove the organic in the mobile phase, and the remaining solution was frozen and lyophilized. Reduction of GSHNE by NaBH4—The hGSTA4-4 enzyme was used in separate incubations with GSH and R-or S-HNE to generate the GSHNE peak I and II diastereomers, respectively. GSHNE was maintained in linear form by reducing the aldehyde to produce GS-1,4-dihydroxynonanol (GSDHN). To accomplish this a 0.2 m NaOH solution containing a 20-fold molar excess of NaBH4 was added to the diastereomers (1:1 v/v) (39Nadkarni D.V. Sayre L.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). After 2 h the reaction was quenched by slowly adding 1 m HCl on ice to achieve a pH of 7.0. The solution was concentrated, and the reduced form of GSHNE was purified by reverse phase HPLC as described above. Fractions were then analyzed by LC/MS (m/z 466) similar to that described below and characterized by NMR. Quantification of GSHNE—The GSHNE conjugates were prepared and purified as described above, and stock concentrations were then determined using a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) assay (40Sashidhar R.B. Capoor A.K. Ramana D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 167: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The absorption of the TNBS derivative was monitored at 335 nm on a Cary 3E UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary, NC) equipped with Cary WinUV software. The concentration of primary amines, and hence the concentration of GSHNE, was determined via linear regression of a standard curve generated from a 0.025% TNBS solution and 50–250 μm GSH. Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry Analysis—LC/MS analyses were conducted on a Waters Alliance 2690 HPLC system interfaced to a Waters Micromass Platform LCZ quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The GSHNE diastereomers were separated by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column (Alltima C18; 150 × 2.1 mm; Alltech) equipped with a guard column (4 × 3 mm) and eluted with an isocratic mobile phase of 16% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min (41Ji B. Ito K. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. Horie T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The desolvation temperature was set to 350 °C, and the cone voltage was maintained at 20 kV. Mass spectral analyses on the kinetic incubations were carried out on 10-μl injections with selected ion monitoring for both the internal standard caffeine (m/z 195.19) and the diastereomeric GSHNE conjugates (m/z 464), utilizing electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode. All of the data were analyzed using Micromass Masslynx V4.0 software. NMR Experiments—Samples containing GSH, GSHNE, or GSDHN were prepared in 70% D2O, and both one-dimensional NMR spectra and two-dimensional 1H-1H correlation spectroscopy and rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (ROESY) 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz NMR spectrometer, equipped with a Varian triple resonance/pulse field gradient probe (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Water suppression was obtained by gradient tailored excitation, and data processing was conducted using MestReC software version 4.9.9.6 (A Coruña, Spain). Three-dimensional conformations of the GSHNE diastereomers were modeled using the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) software (42Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Energy minimized structures were calculated by performing simulated annealing structure determinations on the potential stereochemical configurations for GSHNE with and without the distance restraint estimates obtained from the analysis of two-dimensional ROESY NMR data, using parameters selected from the all-hydrogen (PARALLHDG) geometric energy function parameter set. Relative energies calculated for each combination were used to select the best fit stereochemical configurations. Spontaneous Formation of the Diastereomeric GSHNE Conjugates—HNE spontaneously reacts with GSH to form an adduct with a new chiral center generated at the site of conjugation (Fig. 1). Equilibrium favors the cyclic hemiacetal structure produced from the intramolecular reaction of the 4-hydroxyl group with the aldehyde, which creates an additional chiral center in the molecule (14Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar). Similar to results previously obtained by Ji et al. (41Ji B. Ito K. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. Horie T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the spontaneous reaction of racemic HNE with GSH produced a LC/MS spectrum with four major diastereomeric peaks (Fig. 2A). Taking into account the chiral centers inherent in GSH, there are eight potential GSHNE diastereomers in total, and it is possible that each of the four peaks constitute a pair of unresolved diastereomers. To obtain a partial assignment of configuration and correlate the absolute stereochemistry originating from the hydroxyl group with retention time, the enantioisomeric HNE substrates were also used in separate incubations with GSH. The diastereomers derived from the spontaneous reaction for R-HNE co-elute with two of the four peaks seen in the racemic reaction (Fig. 2A, peaks I and IV), whereas the diastereomers derived from S-HNE co-elute with the remaining two peaks (Fig. 2A, peaks II and III). These results (Fig. 2, B and C) indicate that the differences in retention time for peaks I and IV, and likewise for peaks II and III, are a result of opposite configurations at the site of GSH conjugation and not at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. Product Stereoselectivity of hGSTA4-4—To determine whether hGSTA4-4 displays stereoselectivity in the production of GSHNE, LC/MS analyses of incubations of GSH with the racemic and enantioisomeric HNE substrates were conducted in the absence and presence of hGSTA4-4. As reported above, the spontaneous reaction produced a LC/MS spectrum with four major peaks. However, as shown in Fig. 3A, when hGSTA4-4 catalyzed this reaction, only two of the peaks (peaks I and II) were observed, indicating that hGSTA4-4 conjugates GSH to HNE in a stereoselective manner that is not maintained in the spontaneous reaction. Furthermore, these results, as well as the outcome obtained with the individual HNE enantiomers (Fig. 3, B and C), establish that the GSHNE peak I and II diastereomers are stereoselectively derived from the hGSTA4-4 catalyzed conjugation of GSH with R- and S-HNE, respectively. Although all four peaks are generated in relatively small and roughly equal amounts by the spontaneous reaction, the GSHNE peak III and IV diastereomers are exclusively derived from the spontaneous reaction. Product Stereoselectivity of Other hGST Isoforms—Similar LC/MS experiments were conducted to compare the stereoselectivity of hGSTA4-4 with other hGST isoforms. Shown in Fig. 4B are results acquired with racemic HNE using A1-1, which indicate that it is less product stereoselective than A4-4. These two isoforms share 52% sequence identity and are known to share similar overall topologies, dimer interactions, and conserved GSH-binding sites (22Bruns C.M. Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Despite their numerous similarities, these isoforms show a high degree of variability in their substrate specificities, including a dramatic preference by GSTA4-4 for lipid peroxidation products (22Bruns C.M.

J. 1998; 330: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Unique structural attributes in the C-terminal region are already known to be important for the high catalytic efficiency of A4-4 with HNE (22Bruns C.M. Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 43Nilsson L.O. Gustafsson A. Mannervik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9408-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and, speculatively, can be implicated in stereoselectivity as well. To explore this issue, the hGSTA4-4 F111V/Y217R and hGSTA1-1 V111F/R217Y mutants previously generated in our lab were also inspected for stereoselectivity. The hGSTA4-4 enzyme contains an edge-to-face aromatic-aromatic interaction between Phe-111 and Tyr-217 that is absent in hGSTA1-1. The interaction between these two residues contributes to a closer association between the α4-α5 helix-turn-helix and C-terminal regions of hGSTA4-4. The mutants eliminate and incorporate this interaction into hGSTA4-4 and hGSTA1-1, respectively, and were recently shown to yield substrate specificity and stability toward denaturants between that of the two wild-type proteins (23Hou L. Honaker M.T. Shireman L.M. Balogh L.M. Roberts A.G. Ng K.C. Nath A. Atkins W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23264-23274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In line with this trend, the LC/MS results show that the mutants are more stereoselective than A1-1 but still less stereoselective than A4-4 (Fig. 4, C and D). The chromatographic resolution of GSHNE peaks I and IV provides a facile opportunity to quantitatively compare the stereoselectivity of related hGST isofoms. Using the peak IV/I ratio as an indication of the stereoselectivity of GSH attack at carbon 3 of R-HNE, hGSTA4-4 has the highest degree of stereoselectivity (IV/I = 0) followed next by hGSTA4-4 F111V/Y217R (IV/I = 0.02), hGSTA1-1 V111F/R217Y (IV/I = 0.12), and lastly hGSTA1-1 (IV/I = 0.39). Also reported in Fig. 4E are results from hGSTP1-1 catalysis, where not only was the enzyme less stereoselective, but it also catalyzed the formation of the diastereomers with the opposite configuration at the site of conjugation compared with the A class GSTs tested. NMR Characterization and Simulated Annealing to Assign Absolute Stereochemistry—GSHNE contains three chiral centers in the cyclic hemiacetal portion of the structure, and the resulting complicated diastereotopic splittings as well as contributions from multiple conformers make the 1H NMR spectrum complex to directly analyze. To facilitate identification, some of the diastereomers were subjected to separate characterizations by NMR. We were able to isolate three of the GSHNE diastereomers (peaks I, II, and IV) as well as the reduced forms (GSDHN) of peaks I and II. We observed signals near 5.5 ppm, which were assigned to the 1-H of GSHNE and are consistent with the cyclic hemiacetal form of HNE adducts (44Aldini G. Carini M. Beretta G. Bradamante S. Facino R.M.

https://openalex.org/W2037449911,"Identifying 14-3-3 isoform-specific substrates and functions may be of broad relevance to cell signaling research because of the key role played by this family of proteins in many vital processes. A multitude of ligands have been identified, but the extent to which they are isoform-specific is a matter of debate. Herein we demonstrate, both in vitro and in vivo, a specific, functionally relevant interaction of human 14-3-3γ with the molecular scaffold KSR1, which is mediated by the C-terminal stretch of 14-3-3γ. Specific binding to 14-3-3γ protected KSR1 from epidermal growth factor-induced dephosphorylation and impaired its ability to activate ERK2 and facilitate Ras signaling in Xenopus oocytes. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated inhibition of 14-3-3γ resulted in the accumulation of KSR1 in the plasma membrane, all in accordance with 14-3-3γ being the cytosolic anchor that keeps KSR1 inactive. We also provide evidence that KSR1-bound 14-3-3γ heterodimerized preferentially with selected isoforms and that KSR1 bound monomeric 14-3-3γ. In sum, we have demonstrated ligand discrimination among 14-3-3 isoforms and shed light on molecular mechanisms of 14-3-3 functional specificity and KSR1 regulation.

The 14-3-3 proteins comprise a large family of highly conserved, acidic polypeptides of 28–33 kDa that are expressed ubiquitously in all eukaryotic species (1Aitken A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Seven isoforms, each encoded by a distinct gene, have been described in mammals: β, γ, ϵ, η, σ, τ/θ, and ζ. In plants, up to 15 isoforms have been identified, and in yeast, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, only two isoforms have been reported (1Aitken A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Initially described in 1967 (2Moore B.W. Perez V.J. Carlson F Physiological and Biochemical Aspects of Nervous Integration. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1967: 343-359Google Scholar), these proteins were characterized a decade ago as the first distinct phosphoserine (pSer) 6The abbreviations used are: pSer, phosphoserine; KSR, kinase suppressor of Ras; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; PP2A, protein phosphatase type 2A; CTS, C-terminal stretch; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; WB, Western blot; IP, immunoprecipitation; HA, hemagglutinin; GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EGF, epidermal growth factor. -binding proteins (3Muslin A.J.

Since then, a varied multitude of interacting partners have been identified, participating in cellular processes as diverse as signal transduction, cell-cycle control, apoptosis, regulation of metabolism, protein trafficking, cell morphology, transcription, stress response, and oncogenic transformation (1Aitken A.

Large scale analyses aimed at identifying potential 14-3-3 ligands have consistently resulted in long lists of proteins. Two laboratories independently have identified more than 200 interacting partners using and in vitro affinity chromatography protocol (5Meek S.E. Lane W.S. Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol.

Further, transgenic mouse proteomics allowed the identification of 147 brain proteins interacting with 14-3-3ζ (8Angrand P.O. Segura I. Volkel P. Ghidelli S. Terry R. Brajenovic M. Vintersten K.

With the seven mammalian isoforms sharing a 70% identity, the question arises as to how they achieve specificity in regulating hundreds of different proteins. On a structural level, 14-3-3 proteins form U-shaped dimers, each monomer containing nine anti-parallel α-helices, named A to I (9Gardino A.K. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Helices A to D are involved in dimer formation, and helices C, E, G, and I form a large amphipathic groove critically involved in binding to pSer/Thr-containing proteins (9Gardino A.K. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Screening of phosphopeptide libraries and structural analysis of 14-3-3/phosphopeptide complexes have identified two high-affinity binding motifs: RSXpSXP (mode 1) and RXXXpSXP (mode 2) (10Yaffe M.B.

In addition, exoenzyme S is able to interact with 14-3-3 in a nonphosphorylated form (11Ottmann C. Yasmin L. Weyand M. Veesenmeyer J.L. Diaz M.H. Palmer R.H. Francis M.S. Hauser A.R. Wittinghofer A. Hallberg B. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 902-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and recently a C-terminal mode 3-binding motif has been described in some 14-3-3 ligands having a general consensus of p(S/T)X1–2-COOH (12Coblitz B. Wu M. Shikano S. Li M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1531-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Despite these exceptions, the majority of ligands bind to 14-3-3 proteins through the unique mode 1 or mode 2 sequence. This, in addition to extensive sequence conservation among 14-3-3 proteins, makes it difficult to uncover any specific role for each isoform and to understand the molecular determinants contributing to substrate specificity. Published data regarding substrate discrimination by 14-3-3 isoforms are scarce, with experiments having been performed mainly in vitro and often including only a few isotypes. Thus far, a detailed molecular analysis of 14-3-3 specificity both in vitro and in vivo is lacking (1Aitken A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). An important 14-3-3-interacting protein is the molecular scaffold kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1) (13Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). KSR1 facilitates transduction of Ras-dependent signals by bringing into contact the individual components of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade (14Claperon A. Therrien M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3143-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Lozano J. Xing R. Cai Z. Jensen H.L. Trempus C. Mark W. Cannon R. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4232-4238PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with such a role, KSR1 can interact transiently with Raf and ERK1/2 (16Xing H. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 17Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell.

Han M. Guan K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5523-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). KSR1 also interacts with regulatory enzymes such as the Ser/Thr phosphatase PP2A (19Ory S. Zhou M. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Morrison D.K. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1356-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and the Ser/Thr kinases C-TAK1 (Cdc25C-associated kinase) and CK2 (casein kinase 2) (20Ritt D.A. Zhou M. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Copeland T.D. Morrison D.K. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Muller J. Ory S. Copeland T. Piwnica-Worms H. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 983-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Binding of KSR1 to 14-3-3 is regulated by phosphorylation on Ser-392 by C-TAK1 and on Ser-297 by an unknown kinase (17Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The KSR1-bound PP2A activity dephosphorylates pSer-392 in response to Ras activation, resulting in the dissociation of the KSR1/14-3-3 complex and translocation of KSR1 to the plasma membrane, likely mediated by exposure of its cysteine-rich domain (CRD) (19Ory S. Zhou M. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Morrison D.K. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1356-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In the membrane, KSR1 facilitates ERK activation by a dual mechanism involving the assembling of a signaling complex (scaffold function) and activation of Raf kinases through its associated CK2 activity (20Ritt D.A. Zhou M. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Copeland T.D. Morrison D.K. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, 14-3-3 proteins critically regulate KSR1 function by sequestering it in the cytosol until Ras activation. It is not known whether KSR1 interacts promiscuously with 14-3-3 proteins or, on the contrary, the interaction is isoform-specific. Therefore, we chose KSR1 as a functionally relevant ligand to study 14-3-3 isoform specificity and to gain insight into its own regulation. Here, we demonstrate the existence of functional specificity among 14-3-3 isoforms by showing that 14-3-3γ interacts specifically with KSR1, regulating its ability to translocate to the plasma membrane and facilitate Ras-induced ERK2 activation. We show that the flexible C-terminal tail of 14-3-3γ is required for a full and specific interaction with KSR1 and that 14-3-3γ heterodimerizes preferentially with selected isoforms when bound to KSR1. Further, we provide data from molecular modeling that rationalizes the reported lower affinity binding of some mode 1-deviating binding sites (such as pSer-297 in KSR1) and also show that KSR1 can bind monomeric 14-3-3γ. Antibodies—Antibodies against KSR1 and 14-3-3ϵ were from BD Biosciences. Antibodies specific for the 14-3-3-β, -γ, -η, -τ and -ζ isoforms, GST, Myc, and an anti-14-3-3 broad antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An antibody specific for 14-3-3σ was from Lab Vision. The anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies against Xenopus XMpk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Cdc2 have been described (22Perdiguero E. Nebreda A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 250: 299-314PubMed Google Scholar). An antibody specific for KSR1 phosphorylated on residue Ser-392 was produced by immunizing rabbits with the KLH-conjugated phosphopeptide KSR-pSer-392 (H-LRRTEpSVPSDINC-OH). Phosphospecific antibodies were purified from serum by two-step affinity purification using HiTrap protein A (GE Healthcare) and phosphopeptide-coupled SulfoLink columns (Pierce). Cell Culture—293 and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and antibiotics. U2OS cells, kindly provided by Dr. M. A. Medina (Universidad de Málaga, Spain), were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Transfections were performed with the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Xenopus laevis oocytes were maintained in modified Barth saline (mBarth) medium as described (22Perdiguero E. Nebreda A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 250: 299-314PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Lysates—293 or COS-7 cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed in NP-40 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors) (15Lozano J. Xing R. Cai Z. Jensen H.L. Trempus C. Mark W. Cannon R. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4232-4238PubMed Google Scholar). Oocyte lysates were prepared by resuspending 3–5 frozen oocytes in 10 μl/oocyte of H1K buffer (80 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5; 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm benzamidine, and protease inhibitors) and passing them several times through a micropipette tip. For immunoprecipitation, 250 μg of lysates expressing FLAG-tagged proteins were incubated with 20 μl (50% vol/vol) of FLAG affinity resin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with NP-40 buffer. Myc-tagged KSR1 was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of a polyclonal c-Myc antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation with 30 μl of 50% protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Plasmids—pCMV-FLAG-KSR1, encoding mouse FLAG-tagged KSR1, was kindly provided by Dr. Richard N. Kolesnick (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). This plasmid was used as a template to obtain the pCMV-FLAG-CA3mut, pCMV-FLAG-KSR1-S297A, pCMV-FLAG-KSR1-S392A, and pCMV-FLAG-KAA plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The pCMV-FLAG-KRK/KSR1 plasmid was constructed exactly as described (23Zhou M. Horita D.A. Waugh D.S. Byrd R.A. Morrison D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The seven isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins (β, γ, ϵ, η, σ, τ, and ζ), each in a pGEX-6P1 vector, were provided by Dr. Cheryl L. Walker (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). These constructs were used to generate their Myc-tagged counterparts for expression in mammalian cells as follows. The β, η, σ, and τ isoforms were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pCMV-Tag3B (Stratagene), and the ϵ and γ isoforms were subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites. The 14-3-3ζ cDNA was amplified by PCR using the pGEX-6P1-14-3-3ζ plasmid as template and primers zBamHI and zEcoRIr (the sequences of all primers used in this study can be found in supplemental Table 1). The PCR product was digested with BamHI/EcoRI and ligated into pCMV-Tag3B. The plasmid pCMV-FLAG-14-3-3γ was obtained by digestion of pCMV-myc-14-3-3γ with BamHI/XhoI and ligation of the resulting fragment into pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene). To obtain the plasmids for the mammalian two-hybrid experiments, mouse KSR1 was amplified by PCR using pCMV-FLAG-KSR1 as template and primers KSR6b and KSR17. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI/XbaI and subcloned into the pM vector (Stratagene). Primers MycBglII and pCMV3-XbaI were used to amplify the cDNAs coding for the seven 14-3-3 isoforms, using the Myc-tagged constructs as templates. The PCR products were digested with BglII/XbaI (β, γ, ϵ, η, τ, and ζ isoforms) or with BglII/HindIII (σ isoform) and ligated into the pVP16 vector (Stratagene). The 14-3-3 C-terminal deletion mutants (14-3-3-ΔC mutants) were generated by PCR using the Myc-tagged constructs as templates, a common T3 forward primer, and the following isoform-specific reverse primers: ϵ3′-ΔC, γ3′-ΔC, η3′-ΔC, σ3′-ΔC, and τ3′-ΔC. The 14-3-3β-ΔC and 14-3-3ζ-ΔC inserts were amplified using the T3 forward primer and a common β/ζ3′-ΔC reverse primer. PCR products were digested with NotI/XhoI except those corresponding to the βΔC and ζΔC inserts that were digested with NotI/EcoRI. After gel purification they were ligated into pCMV-Tag3B. Plasmids encoding the 14-3-3γ/ϵ, 14-3-3γ/η, 14-3-3γ/ζ, 14-3-3ϵ/γ, and 14-3-3η/γ chimeric molecules were constructed in two steps as follows. A common T3 forward primer was used in combination with reverse primers γ3′-EcoRV, ϵ3′-EcoRV, and η3′-EcoRV and templates pCMV-myc-14-3-3γ, pCMV-myc-14-3-3ϵ, and pCMV-myc-14-3-3η, respectively, to amplify nucleotides coding for residues 1–235 of 14-3-3γ (lacking the last 12 residues), 1–233 of 14-3-3ϵ (lacking the last 22 residues), and 1–236 of 14-3-3η (lacking the last 10 residues). The PCR fragments were digested with NotI/EcoRV and ligated into pCMV-Tag3B to generate plasmids pCMV-myc-14-3-3γC′, pCMV-myc14-3-3ϵC′, and pCMV-myc-14-3-3ηC′. Then, fragments containing the C-terminal residues of the γ, ϵ, η, and ζ isoforms plus vector sequence downstream of the multicloning site were amplified with forward primers γ5′-EcoRV, ϵ5′-EcoRV, η5′-SmaI, ζ5′-SmaI, and the common reverse primer pCMV3′-DraIII. Finally, the PCR products were digested with EcoRV/DraIII or SmaI/DraIII and ligated into pCMV-myc-14-3-3γC′, pCMV-myc14-3-3ϵC′, or pCMV-myc-14-3-3ηC′ to generate the appropriate chimeric constructs. Plasmids for in vitro mRNA synthesis were generated as follows. A mouse KSR1 fragment was PCR-amplified from pCMV-FLAG-KSR1 with primers KEcoRIf and MKSRSalI. The PCR product was digested with BglII/SalI and ligated into pFTX5 precut with BamHI/XhoI. Constructs FTX4-14-3-3β, FTX4-14-3-3η, FTX4-14-3-3σ, and FTX4-14-3-3τ were subcloned from their pGEX6P1-derived counterparts by ligation of a BamHI/EcoRI fragment into pFTX4. Constructs FTX4-14-3-3γ and FTX4-14-3-3ϵ were generated after ligation of BamHI/XhoI fragments from their pGEX6P1 counterparts into pFTX4. The plasmid FTX4-14-3-3ζ was generated by PCR amplification from pGEX6P1-14-3-3ζ using primers zBamHI and zEcoRIr. The amplified cDNA was digested with BamHI/EcoRI and ligated into pFTX4. Vectors pFTX4 and pFTX5 have been described (22Perdiguero E. Nebreda A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 250: 299-314PubMed Google Scholar, 24Howell M. Hill C.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7411-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The pCMV-myc14-3-3γ-K50E mutant was obtained with mutagenic primers 1433γK50Ef and 1433γK50Er. The 1433γS59Df and 1433γS59Dr primers were used to clone the mutant pCMV-myc-14-3-3γ-S59D and pCMV-FLAG-14-3-3γ-S59D constructs. The EYFP-difopein and EYFP-R18(Lys) plasmids were gifts from Dr. Haian Fu (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). GST Pulldown Assays—GST-14-3-3 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells essentially as described (25Liu M.Y. Cai S. Espejo A. Bedford M.T. Walker C.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6475-6480PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates from 293 cells expressing FLAG-KSR1 (250 μg) were incubated with recombinant GST-14-3-3 for 30 min (4 °C). Complexes were recovered by adding 30 μl of 50% (vol/vol) glutathione-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) for an additional 30 min (4 °C). After three washes in NP-40 buffer, the amount of FLAG-KSR1 bound to GST-14-3-3 isoforms was determined by Western blot (WB) with a FLAG antibody and quantitated as the percent of input material by loading 12.5 μg of the lysate in each gel. For the competition assays, 150 μm of the phospho- or non-phosphopeptides were incubated with 1 μg of GST-14-3-3 for 30 min at 4 °C before the addition of 150 μg of FLAG-KSR1 lysates. Endogenous B-KSR1 was pulled down by incubating 10 μg of each GST-14-3-3 isoform with 1.5 mg of mouse brain lysates prepared as described (20Ritt D.A. Zhou M. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Copeland T.D. Morrison D.K. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Pulldown/IP Depletion Assay—A FLAG-KSR1-expressing cell lysate (1.5 mg) was subjected to pulldown with 180 μl of 50% (vol/vol) GST-14-3-3γ-prebound beads (10 μg protein/30 μl resin). One-third of the supernatant (∼500 μg), containing unbound proteins, was immunoprecipitated with 30 μl of an anti-FLAG resin, and the remaining (∼1000 μg) was again pulled down with 120 μl of GST-14-3-3γ beads. After that, half of the supernatant (∼500 μg) was subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with 30 μl of FLAG resin. The activation state of FLAG-KSR1 was determined with an anti-pKSR1 antibody. Endogenous 14-3-3 still associated with FLAG-KSR1 after each pulldown was detected in the immunoprecipitates with a pan-14-3-3 antibody. ELISA Format Binding Assay—We followed a protocol similar to a published assay (26Paschal B.M. Delphin C. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7679-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, different amounts of GST fusion proteins were diluted in coating buffer (PBS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 mm dithiothreitol) and allowed to bind to the wells of a microtiter plate by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Nonoccupied sites were blocked with blocking buffer (PBS, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates from 293 FLAG-KSR1-expresing cells were diluted in blocking buffer at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/μl and added to the wells (50 μg/well) loaded with the GST-14-3-3 proteins. After 1 h (4 °C), the wells were washed three times with PBS. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated FLAG antibody diluted 1:3000 in PBST (PBS plus 0.2% Tween 20) was then added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Wells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 200 μl of solution D (0.04% o-phenylenediamine, 8 mm citric acid, 17 mm Na2HPO4, 0.012% H2O2) at room temperature until color developed (usually 15 min). The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl/well 1 n H2SO4 and the amount of FLAG-KSR1 recovered on each well was determined by measuring absorbance at 492 nm in a microplate reader. Data were normalized to values obtained from wells containing GST alone. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—293 cells were seeded in 60-mm plates (500,000 cells/plate) and transfected with a combination of the following plasmids: pM-CAT reporter (0.2 μg), pM-KSR1 (1.5 μg), and pVP16-myc-14-3-3 specific for each isoform (0.5 μg for γ, 1.0 μg for η, σ, and τ, and 2.0 μg for β, ϵ, and ζ). Forty-eight hours later, CAT expression, indicative of the in vivo KSR1/14-3-3 interaction, was measured by a colorimetric enzyme immunoassay using the CAT ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science). Oocyte Meiotic Maturation Assay—X. laevis oocytes were prepared essentially as described (22Perdiguero E. Nebreda A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 250: 299-314PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pFTX5-KSR1 and pFTX4-14-3-3 (2–3 μg) were linearized and used as templates for capped mRNA synthesis with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitro transcription kit (Ambion Inc.). To avoid inhibition of Ras-induced maturation due to KSR1 scaffolding activity (17Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the amount of injected KSR1 mRNA was titrated previously. Oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of the in vitro transcribed mRNAs (2.5 ng for Myc-KSR1 and 35 ng for HA-14-3-3) and maintained at 18 °C in mBarth medium. Five hours later the oocytes were reinjected with 50 ng of a mRNA encoding Myc-H-RasG12K and scored for germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) as a measure of meiotic maturation. GVBD was scored when 5–10% of the oocytes injected with Ras alone had undergone GVBD (usually 6–8 h after injection) (17Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). RNA Interference—Synthetic siRNAs specific for human 14-3-3γ (NM_012479) or 14-3-3τ (NM_006826) were purchased from Ambion Inc. as 19-mer complementary RNA duplexes with UU overhangs at their 3′-ends. A scrambled sequence with no homology in the human genomic data base was used as a negative control. U2OS cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected 24 h later (day 1) with the corresponding siRNAs (20 nm) by the calcium phosphate method. The cells were retransfected 24 h later (day 2) following the same protocol, and on day 3, the cells were transfected with 2.0 μg of pCMV-FLAG-KSR1 using the FuGENE 6 reagent. On day 5, the cells were processed for Western blot and immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence—Transfected cells grown on coverslips in 6-well plates were formalin-fixed, permeabilized with PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained either singly or doubly with a mouse monoclonal FLAG antibody and a rabbit polyclonal Myc antibody followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated goat antimouse antibody and a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Isolation of 14-3-3 Dimers Bound to KSR1—Total cell lysates (3.5 mg) prepared from 293 cells coexpressing FLAG-KSR1 and Myc-14-3-3γ were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads as described above and washed sequentially with NP-40 buffer (five times) and Tris-buffered saline (twice). Bound FLAG-KSR1 was eluted twice by incubation at 15 °C for 15 min in 35 μl of 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in Tris-buffered saline. The combined eluates were diluted 1:2 in NP-40 buffer. One-half was immunoprecipitated with 5.6 μg of a Myc polyclonal antibody, and the other half was immunoprecipitated with 5.6 μg of a non-immune rabbit IgG for 2 h at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with NP-40 buffer, resuspended in 70 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with specific anti-14-3-3 antibodies. A 10 μl-aliquot was loaded per well. As a control, we also immunoprecipitated sequentially, with FLAG and Myc antibodies, a 293 lysate expressing FLAG-KSR1 alone. Cross-linking Experiments—COS-7 lysates expressing either FLAG-14-3-3γ or FLAG-14-3-3γ-S59D were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG affinity resin. Beads were washed three times with NP-40 buffer and twice with phosphate buffer. Dimers in the immunoprecipitates were chemically cross-linked with 50 μg/ml bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Sigma-Aldrich) as described (27Woodcock J.M. Murphy J. Stomski F.C. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36323-36327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—Interactions of KSR1 phosphopeptides with residues in the 14-3-3γ basic pocket were modeled with the program Mutmodel (28Shih H.H. Brady J. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1697-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using the crystal structure of human 14-3-3γ bound to mode 1 phosphopeptide RAIpSLP (Protein Data Bank ID: 2B05) as template. Water accessibility for 14-3-3γ protein was calculated with the DSSP program (29Carter P. Andersen C.A. Rost B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3293-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The DALI program (30Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) was used to superimpose the different 14-3-3 proteins complexes retrieved from the Protein Data Bank and the two modeled KSR1 phosphopeptides, using the 2B05 coordinates as the fixed structural reference. The three-dimensional images were rendered with VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) (30Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). KSR1 Interacts Preferentially with 14-3-3γ in Vitro—The seven human 14-3-3 isoforms are highly similar at the amino acid level, sharing an average identity of 70% and having strictly conserved residues directly involved in pSer recognition (9Gardino A.K. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the functional role of 14-3-3 proteins in KSR1 regulation, we first searched for any isotype-related difference in binding. The seven GST-tagged human 14-3-3 isoforms were purified to near homogeneity (supplemental Fig. 1A) and used as baits in pulldown experiments with FLAG-KSR1-expressing cell lysates. We could not perform direct interaction assays because production of full-length recombinant KSR1 was not possible in our laboratory. This problem has also been reported by other groups (31Hartsough M.T. Morrison D.K. Salerno M. Palmieri D. Ouatas T. Mair M. Patrick J. Steeg P.S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2002652779,"The Wilms' tumor protein Wt1 is required for embryonic development and has been implicated in hematologic disorders. Since Wt1 deficiency may compromise the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells, we analyzed the possible role of the transcriptionally active Wt1 isoform, Wt1(-KTS), in regulating the expression of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). Wt1 and EpoR were coexpressed in CD117(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells and in several hematopoietic cell lines. CD117(+) cells of Wt1-deficient murine embryos (Wt1(-/-)) exhibited a significantly lower proliferation response to recombinant erythropoietin than CD117(+) cells of heterozygous (Wt1(+/-)) and wild-type littermates (Wt1(+/+)). EpoR expression was significantly diminished in hematopoietic progenitors (CD117(+)) that lacked Wt1, and the erythroid colony-forming capacity was reduced by more than 50% in fetal liver cells of Wt1-deficient embryonic mice. Wt1(-KTS) significantly increased endogenous EpoR transcripts in transfected cells. The proximal EpoR promoter of human and mouse was stimulated more than 10-fold by Wt1(-KTS) in transiently cotransfeced K562 erythroleukemia cells. A responsible cis-element, which is highly conserved in the EpoR promoter of human and mouse, was identified by mutation analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In conclusion, activation of the EpoR gene by Wt1 may represent an important mechanism in normal hematopoiesis."

https://openalex.org/W2009747958,"Human Goodpasture antigen-binding protein (GPBP) is an atypical protein kinase that phosphorylates the Goodpasture auto-antigen, the α3 chain of collagen IV. The COL4A3BP gene is alternatively spliced producing two protein isoforms: GPBP and GPBPΔ26. The latter lacks a serine-rich domain composed of 26 amino acid residues. Both isoforms also function as ceramide transfer proteins (CERT). Here, we explored the function of Gpbp and GpbpΔ26/CERT during embryogenesis in zebrafish. We cloned both splice variants of the zebrafish gene and found that they are differentially expressed during development. We used antisense oligonucleotide-mediated loss-of-function and synthetic mRNA-based gain-of-function approaches. Our results show that the loss-of-function phenotype is linked to cell death, evident primarily in the muscle of the somites, extensive loss of myelinated tracks, and brain edema. These results indicate that disruption of the nonvesicular ceramide transport is detrimental to normal embryonic development of somites and brain because of increased apoptosis. Moreover, this phenotype is mediated by Gpbp but not GpbpΔ26/CERT, suggesting that Gpbp is an important factor for normal skeletal muscle and brain development.

Moreover, this phenotype is mediated by Gpbp but not GpbpΔ26/CERT, suggesting that Gpbp is an important factor for normal skeletal muscle and brain development. The Goodpasture antigen-binding protein or GPBP (coded by the COL4A3BP gene) was originally identified in a screen for proteins expressed from a HeLa cDNA library for its capacity to bind the Goodpasture auto-antigen, the noncollagenous (NC1) domain of the α3 chain of human collagen (IV) (1Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The protein is a nonconventional protein kinase that phosphorylates the auto-antigen. The gene is alternatively spliced and produces two protein isoforms: the full-length GPBP and GPBPΔ26. The latter lacks a serine-rich domain, composed of 26 amino acid residues, that is encoded by exon 11. The short isoform has less binding capacity to the Goodpasture auto-antigen and weaker kinase activity. GPBP can play a role in autoimmune responses, because it is overexpressed in many autoimmune conditions (2Raya A. Revert-Ros F. Martinez-Martinez P. Navarro S. Roselló E. Vieites B. Granero F. Forteza J. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40392-40399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A recent study, using cell culture, has revealed a second function of both GPBP and GPBPΔ26, as ceramide transfer proteins (CERT) (3Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The two isoforms share in common an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) 3The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; START, steridogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer; SR, serine-rich; MO, morpholino; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; UTR, untranslated region; TUNEL, terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; hpf, hour(s) post-fertilization; cRNA, capped RNA; FFAT, two phenylalanines in acidic tract. domain and a serine-rich (SR) domain, a middle FFAT motif (two phenylalanines in acidic tract), and a carboxyl-terminal START domain. The PH domain and the FFAT domain permit the localization of the protein to the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), respectively, whereas the START domain binds and transfers ceramide between lipid membranes. A serine-rich motif in CERT undergoes phosphorylation, which down-regulates the ER to Golgi transport of ceramide. A recent study in Drosophila has shown that loss of function of a GPBP/CERT-like protein leads to enhanced oxidative damage that reduces lifespan (4Rao, R. P., Yuan, C., Allegood, J. C., Rawat, S. S., Edwards, M. B., Wang, X., Merrill, A. H., Jr., Acharya, U., and Acharya, J. K. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 11364-11369Google Scholar). To understand the physiological function of vertebrate GPBP and its shorter isoform, GPBPΔ26/CERT, we cloned the zebrafish col4a3bp gene and explored the function of the two splice variants during embryonic development. We found that both isoforms are dynamically expressed during early development and, when depleted, lead to apoptosis in selective tissues. Moreover, our results show that GPBP but not CERT carries the anti-apoptotic activity during early embryogenesis and that GPBP is an important factor for normal skeletal muscle and brain development. Materials—The preparation of monoclonal antibody against human GPBP (Mab14) was previously described (1Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) at 1:1000. The secondary antibodies were anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Sigma) at 1:20,000, anti-mouse IgG1 anti-mouse biotin-conjugated antibody, and avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Synthetic Polymers—The following oligonucleotides were synthesized (Midland, Midland, TX): ZF-1F, 5′-GCAGGAGACGTGCAGTGTTGAGG-3′; ZF-2F, 5′-ATGTCAGACTGCAGTTCCTCGGG-3′; ZFE2-R, 5′-CCAGCGGTCCTGCCAGCCATGAATG-3′; ZF-2R, 5′-TCAGAAGAGGATGGCCTCACTGC-3′; ZF-3F, 5′-GCAGGCAGGTGGACACACTGC-3′; ZF-3R, 5′-CTTTGTCCCTGTGGAGCTCATC-3′; ZF-4F, 5′-GTTGAGGAGATGGTGCACAGTCAC-3′; ZF-4R, 5′-GCCGTTCTCCTCCACCTCTCC-3′; E-11F, 5′-CCTCACAGTCACACGTCCTCCT-3′; E-11R, 5′-CTGAGCACTGAACCTGTGCAC-3′; xba2F, 5′-AAATCTAGACATGTCAGACTGCAGTTCCTCGGG-3′; Sac2R, 5′-AAAACCGCGGTCAGAAGAGGATGGCCTCACTGC-3′; EcoMFLAGF, 5′-AAAGAATTCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGAC-3′; Eco2R, 5′-AAAGAATTCTCAGAAGAGGATGGCCTCACTGC-3′; ZFE10F, 5′-CCCAGGTGGAAAGGAGCAGGGCAT-3′; ZFE12R, 5′-CTCCTTCTTCAACAACCAGTTGCC-3′; LYAm-F, 5′-GAGTACGGCTGTAGAGAGTCCATCTGTCTCAGC-3′; LYAm-R, 5′-GCTGAGACAGATGGACTCTCTACAGCCGTACTC-3′; ZFGAPDH-F, 5′-CCTCCTGCACCACCAACTGCCTGG-3′; and ZFGAPDHR, 5′-CGGCAATCCCCATTGAAGTCAGTGG-3′. Cloning of gpbp and gpbpΔ26—Zebrafish gpbp and gpbpΔ26 were amplified by PCR using as template a 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) embryonic cDNA library, which was cloned in uni-ZAP XR (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). gpbpΔ26 was amplified as a single fragment using primers ZF-2F and ZF-2R and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene); the PCR product was cloned in the SmaI site of the pBluescript SK(-) vector (Stratagene) to form the pBczfGPBPΔ26 construct. gpbp was amplified in two pieces, which were then cloned independently in the HincII site of pBluescript SK(-). Thus, two constructs were formed, pBcR with the PCR fragment between primers ZF-2F and E11-R and pBcF with the fragment between primers E11-F and ZF-2R. The pBcF construct was digested with AflIII and XhoI and inserted into the pBcR construct to produce pBczfGPBP. The pcDNA3-FLAG-zfGPBP and pcDNA3-FLAG-zfGPBPΔ26 were cloned using a PCR approach. To this end, the pBluescript constructs served as templates, and PCR products were generated with primers Xba2F and Sac2R and digested with XbaI and SacII, and the digested product inserted in the NheI-SacII sites of the pRCX vector (5Leinonen A. Netzer K. Boutad A. Gunwar S. Hudson B.G. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 926-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) producing pRCX-zfGPBP and pRCX-zfGPBPD26 sequences. The constructs are in frame with a FLAG sequence tag present in the vector. Using the pRCX vectors as templates and the primers EcoMFLAGF and Eco2R, the isoforms were reamplified and digested with EcoRI. Subsequently, both PCR products were inserted in the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). For in vitro RNA synthesis, the gpbp fragment was subcloned in the pCS2+ vector without a FLAG sequence by digesting pBczfGPBP with EcoRI and XhoI and inserting in the polylinker of the pCS2+ vector producing the construct pCS2+zfGPBP. The pCS2+zfGPBP construct was digested with BamHI, and the resulting fragment from pBczfGPBPΔ26 was inserted to produce pCS2+zfGPBPΔ26. All of the constructs were verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis—For mutagenesis of gpbp into gpbpG67E (3Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), we used the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the mutagenic primers LYAm-F and LYAmR, using pCS2+zfGPBP as template according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture and DNA Transient Transfections—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method of the Profection mammalian system (Promega, Madison, WI). Immunohistochemistry—Embryos were anesthetized and fixed overnight in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehye in PBS at 4 °C, washed, dehydrated to methanol, and stored at -20 °C. After rehydration, the embryos were washed in PTT (0.3% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) and bathed in blocking solution (1% Me2SO, 0.3% Triton X-100, 2% goat serum, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. Anti-GPBP antibody (Mab14) was prepared in blocking solution at 1:200 dilutions of ascitic fluids and incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washes in PTT, the embryos were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector) at 1:200 dilution in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The color reaction was developed using the Vectastain ABC kit with horseradish peroxidase and 3,3′ diaminobenzidine as chromogen (Vector). After staining, the embryos were cleared and stored in 80% glycerol. Monoclonal F59 antibody (anti-slow myosin heavy chain, a generous gift from F. E. Stockdale, Stanford University) (6Crow M.T. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 238-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and anti-acetylated tubulin antibody (Sigma) were used at 1:100 and 1:200 dilutions, respectively. After extensive washes with PBT (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS), the embryos were incubated with secondary anti-mouse Alexa 488, and Alexa 555 IgG antibodies at 1:400 dilution (Molecular Probes). The F-actin in muscle cells was visualized with Alexa 555-conjugated phalloidin dye at 1:50 dilution in PBT (Molecular Probes). The embryos were washed, mounted on coverslips using ProLong gold medium, and photographed using LMS 510 META inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss). For plastic sections, staged embryos were anesthetized and fixed overnight in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, dehydrated to methanol, and stored at -20 °C until used. The samples were embedded in epoxy solution (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) and cut in 5-micron-thick sections. The sections were stained with toluidine blue and photographed. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from staged embryos using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and retro-transcribed (1 μg) with Superscript II (Invitrogen). The subsequent cDNAs were subjected to PCR using primers ZF-E10F and ZF-E12R with Amplitaq polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels and photographed. Fish Maintenance and Breeding—Fish were maintained and kept under standard laboratory conditions at 28.5 °C (7Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). The embryos were staged and fixed at specific hours post-fertilization as described (8Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8773) Google Scholar). Protein Assays, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—The proteins were extracted after transient transfection from cell plates scraping the cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl 0.5% Triton X-100 supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce) using known bovine serum albumin dilutions to construct a standard curve. For protein expression in morpholino-injected embryos, total proteins were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed under reduced conditions, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bilerica, MA). The presence of specific proteins was detected using anti-GPBP/GPBPΔ26 (Mab14) or FLAG antibodies and immunoperoxidaseor alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. In Vitro Translation and Synthetic mRNA—5 μg of pCS2+ vector plasmid containing the desired insert were digested with NotI, phenol/chlorophorm/isoamyl alcohol was extracted, and the DNA was precipitated and dissolved in nuclease-free water. One μg of the digested plasmid was transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 2 h at 37 °C. The transcription reactions were treated with DNase I, synthetic RNA (cRNA) was purified using MEGAclear (Ambion), and the RNA concentration was calculated by UV absorbance. The RNA was stored frozen in aliquots at -80 °C (the samples were subjected to only one freezing-thawing cycle). The integrity of the synthetic cRNA was assayed in an in vitro translation assay with the Retic Lysate IVT™ (Ambion) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions using [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) as radiolabeled amino acid (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation and Injection of Morpholinos—Morpholino (MO) antisense oligonucleotides (Gene Tools, Corvallis, OR) were designed to complement the sense transcript of gpbp and gpbpΔ26 at the 5′-UTR (MO5′UTR, 5′-GGAAAACTCCGCGATAGTCGTGTTC-3′). A second morpholino was designed to complement the sense nuclear pre-mRNA affecting the 3′ splicing site in front of exon 11. Thus, this morpholino deletes the exon present only in gpbp (MOgpbp-SA, 5′-GACTGTGAGGCTGAACCCAAGAGC-3′). The morpholinos were solubilized in nuclease-free water, and the concentration was determined by UV absorbance. Cell Death Assays—TUNEL and Acridine orange staining were used for apoptosis assays. For TUNEL analysis, the embryos were staged and fixed overnight in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C. After washing, the embryos were dehydrated and stored in methanol. Rehydrated embryos were permeabilized by proteinase K digestion, washed in PBT, and assayed by TUNEL using the in situ cell death detection kit POD (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of positive cells was analyzed under a fluorescence microscope and photographed (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Live embryos were stained for apoptotic cells with the vital dye Acridine orange that permeates inside acidic lysosomal vesicles and becomes fluorescent, thus staining apoptotic cells. A stock solution of 5 mg/ml in egg water was diluted 300 times in egg water, and dechorionated live embryos were bathed in this solution for 20 min in the dark, extensively washed in egg water, analyzed under a fluorescence microscope, and photographed. Identification and Cloning of Zebrafish gpbp and gpbpΔ26 cDNA—To identify zebrafish gpbp, we searched expressed sequence tag databases using human GPBP cDNA as bait (Gen-Bank™ accession number AF136450). The search picked two clones with homologous sequences, each containing the start (AL910168) and the stop codon (BM859835). To obtain full-length coding sequences, we used PCR primers located within the expressed sequence tags and amplified a single product from a zebrafish 24 hpf cDNA library (Fig. 1A). The PCR product was sequenced revealing a 1,785-bp transcript representing gpbpΔ26, the splicing variant of gpbp that codes for a 594-amino acid polypeptide. The BM890535 expressed sequence tag showed an extra 78-bp sequence not present in gpbpΔ26, thus suggesting that it encoded the unspliced variant of gpbp. Based on this sequence, we designed two primer pairs and amplified the putative gpbp in two fragments using the 24-hpf cDNA library as a template (Fig. 1B). Both PCR fragments shared the 78-bp sequence and contained either the 5′ (2F/E11R; 1,176 bp long) or the 3′ (E11F/2R; 765 bp) parts of the cDNA. The two fragments were combined to produce the complete gpbp cDNA of 1,863 bp encoding the 620-amino acid polypeptide. The gpbp sequences were deposited in Gen-Bank™ with the accession numbers EU000165 (gpbp) and EU000166 (gpbpΔ26). The alignment of the zebrafish Gpbp sequence with human and mouse proteins using ClustalW shows high conservation at the amino acid level (Fig. 1D). The zebrafish protein shares a 75% identity with the human, whereas the human and mouse proteins are 96% identical. The secondary structure of the protein includes a PH domain and a serine-rich domain in the amino terminus, a FFAT motif and a second serine-rich domain in the middle part of the protein, which is not present in gpbpΔ26, and a START domain in the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1C). The zebrafish col4a3bp gene that codes for the gpbp and gpbpΔ26 mRNAs is located on chromosome 5 and spans 51 kb of the zebrafish genome. Alignment of the genomic and cDNA sequences revealed 18 highly conserved exons consistent with the GT-AG rule (detailed in supplemental Table S1). Exon 11 is not present in gpbpΔ26, and exon 18 contains the 3′-UTR. The same number of coding exons and a similar arrangement of splicing junctions are found in the human and mouse genes (data not shown). Recombinant Expression of Zebrafish Gpbp and GpbpΔ26—We have produced recombinant FLAG-tagged human GPBP and zebrafish Gpbp and GpbpΔ26 proteins in HEK293 cells, and the expression levels in the lysates were assayed by immunoblotting using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. We observed a single band for each of the splice variants with higher mobility for GpbpΔ26, similar to the previously described human homologs (Fig. 2A); (2Raya A. Revert-Ros F. Martinez-Martinez P. Navarro S. Roselló E. Vieites B. Granero F. Forteza J. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40392-40399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody Mab14, which was raised against the human GPBP protein (1Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), is cross-reacting with both zebrafish isoforms, corroborating the anti-FLAG antibody results (Fig. 2A). Expression Pattern of gpbp—To investigate the temporal expression of gpbp during development, we performed RT-PCR using RNA from zebrafish embryos at different developmental stages. The full-length gpbp is maternally deposited (expressed before mid-blastula transition at 3 hpf), and its level gradually subsides as development progresses. The short isoform, gpbpΔ26, is barely detectable during the first 12 h post-fertilization and increases by the second day of development (Fig. 2B). Therefore, although the gene is expressed at all of the tested developmental stages, gpbp is more abundant at early stages as compared with gpbpΔ26. To gain insight into the spatial distribution of the protein, we analyzed the expression pattern of Gpbp in whole embryos using the Mab14 monoclonal antibody. We found that Gpbp is widely expressed during embryogenesis (Fig. 2C). Because the Mab14 antibody recognizes both splice variants, the staining pattern illustrates the combined expression domains of Gpbp and GpbpΔ26. Knockdown of gpbp and gpbpΔ26 Reveals Specific Brain and Somite Phenotypes—To investigate the function of Gpbp in zebrafish development, we first designed a strategy to knock down gene function by using a morpholino-modified antisense oligonucleotide directed against the 5′-UTR sequence (MO5′UTR). This morpholino blocks protein translation, but it does not affect pre-mRNA processing, e.g. splicing (Fig. 3A). Because the targeted 5′-UTR area is common in both gpbp and gpbpΔ26 transcripts, MO5′UTR is expected to knock down Gpbp and GpbpΔ26 simultaneously. To determine the specificity and effectiveness of the morpholino, we injected increasing amounts of MO5′UTR into one- to four-cell stage embryos. The embryos were then scored for the presence of unspecific necrosis to select morpholino dosage with no apparent toxic effects. To gauge the effectiveness of the morpholino, the proteins were extracted from MO5′UTR-injected embryos and analyzed by Western blotting to test for possible residual Gpbp activity. Staining with the Mab14 antibody showed a significant reduction in the intensity of the Gpbp band, demonstrating that the 5′-UTR morpholino effectively reduces but does not ablate the amount of Gpbp protein (Fig. 3B). MO5′UTR did not interfere with gastrulation and early somitogenesis. Instead, we observed the first phenotypic effects of the morpholino knockdown at 24 hpf. At this stage, the injected embryos exhibited tissue loss in the head region, edema in the fourth brain ventricle, and small eyes. This phenotype persisted at later stages resulting in small head and eyes at 48 hpf (Fig. 3C). To further analyze this phenotype, we prepared histological, plastic sections of the 48-hpf morphants and counterstained them with toluidine blue to reveal tissue and cell morphology. We found that the brain was the most affected organ, with a clear reduction of the myelinated tracts and hydrocephaly of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 3D). We also observed severe tissue damage in the somites with extended loss of muscle fibers (Fig. 3D). To further analyze the neuronal defects, we examined patterning of axonal tracts in the brain using an anti-acetylated tubulin monoclonal antibody. We found that in wild-type embryos the tracts of postotic commissure, posterior commissure, and medial longitudinal fasciculus were established at 24 hpf (9Wilson S.W. Ross L.S. Parrett T. Easter Jr., S.S. Development. 1990; 108: 121-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in knockdown animals, we observed a single axonal tract posterior to the eye (Fig. 4). Histological analysis of the embryonic trunk muscles showed disorganized muscle fibers that were peppered with cell debris (Fig. 3D). To determine whether the defect is limited to slow or fast muscle fibers, we performed immunohistochemical studies using the F59 antibody that recognizes myosin heavy chain in slow muscle fibers (10Henry C.A. Amacher S.L. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 917-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and found that these fibers are present but greatly disorganized, shorter, and with areas of tissue debris between them. Labeling with fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin dye that marks F-actin in slow and fast muscle fibrils showed similar defects, which were first observed at 24 hpf and significantly worsened at 48 hpf (Fig. 4). Thus, it appears that all muscle fibrils are dependent on Gpbp and Cert for normal development and function. Taken together, these data suggest that impairment of Gpbp and GpbpΔ26 function leads to specific brain and muscle defects, whereas gastrulation and early segmentation stages are not affected at these morpholino doses. Suppression of Loss-of-Function Phenotype by mRNA Overexpression—To test the specificity of the morpholino-induced phenotype and to further exclude potential toxic or mistargeting effects, we designed a rescue experiment of the MO5′UTR morphants with synthetic cRNAs encoding gpbp variants (Fig. 5A). The injection of cRNA alone, gpbp, or gpbpΔ26 did not produce any phenotype, and the embryos developed normally (data not shown). When we co-injected 5 ng of 5′-UTR morpholino with 50 pg of gpbp mRNA at one-cell stage embryos, we observed a total suppression of the morpholino-induced phenotype at 24 and 48 hpf in 94% of the injected embryos (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, when we co-injected 5′-UTR morpholino and gpbpΔ26 mRNA, we did not observe suppression of the loss-of-function phenotype (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the long splice variant of Gpbp exerts critical function in neural and muscle development, and its loss leads to severe developmental deficits. Gpbp most likely mediates these effects, because the short variant does not rescue the knockdown phenotype. Selective Knockdown of the Full-length Gpbp Isoform—The rescue experiments suggested that the visible morpholino phenotype might be due predominantly to the loss of gpbp and not gpbpΔ26. To test this notion and to further corroborate the specificity and strength of the MO5′UTR-caused defects, we selectively knocked down the long isoform of gpbp in live embryos. To this end, we designed a morpholino, MOgpbp-SA, to target the 3′ splice site sequence in intron 10 blocking the inclusion of exon 11 in the col4a3bp transcript. This way, the full-length variant of gpbp could be removed without affecting the expression of gpbpΔ26 (Fig. 6A). To test the efficacy of this approach, we injected increasing amounts of MOgpbp-SA into one- to four-cell embryos, isolated RNA, and amplified cDNA fragments spanning exon 11 from injected and uninjected embryos. cDNA samples from control embryos gave rise to two bands of the expected size corresponding to gpbp and gpbpΔ26 transcripts. Conversely, we found that injection of MOgpbp-SA effectively and specifically eliminated the high MW band of the gpbp transcript leaving gpbpΔ26 intact (Fig. 6B). Sequencing of the low molecular weight band confirmed that it is gpbpΔ26, demonstrating that MOgpbp-SA effectively removed exon 11 (data not shown). To investigate the effects of the specific gpbp loss-of-function phenotype, we injected 4 ng of MOgpbp-SA into one- to four-cell embryos. Morphological analysis indicated that the MOgpbp-SA-caused defects at 30 hpf strongly resembled the phenotype observed with MO5′UTR, including extensive cell death in the head region and edema in the fourth brain ventricle (Fig. 6C). At 48 hpf, the phenotype became more severe with strong signs of microphthalmia, microcephaly, and pericardial edema. Of note, the mortality of the splice site morpholino-injected embryos was higher (40%) as compared with 5′-UTR morphants (10%). These data indicate that knockdown of both Gpbp and GpbpΔ26 isoforms or elimination of the long Gpbp form alone results in almost identical defects. Thus, it appears that the brain and muscle dysmorphologies are mediated by loss of function of the full-length Gpbp. These data are also in agreement with the fact that gpbp but not gpbpΔ26 RNA could rescue the morpholino defects. Gpbp Regulates Apoptosis—To investigate whether cell death might be causing the tissue damage after the gpbp knockdown, we assayed apoptosis in living embryos by Acridine orange staining. Acridine orange is a vital dye that binds to DNA and RNA and is routinely used to discriminate between apoptosis and necrosis (11Abrams J. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Development. 1993; 117: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When MO5′UTR- or MOgpbp-SA-injected embryos and uninjected controls were stained with Acridine orange, morpholino-injected embryos showed more intense staining than controls. Moreover, staining was confined to the areas affected by the gpbp knockdown. Specifically, the highest count of Acridine orange-positive cells were in the hindbrain and the fourth ventricle, telencephalon, diencephalon, and the neural tube, somites, and paraxial mesoderm of the tail (Fig. 7, A and B). The results were further confirmed by TUNEL assay, which detects end stage apoptotic DNA fragmentation, in MO5′UTR-injected and uninjected control embryos. We found an abundance of positive cells in the morpholino-injected embryos at the areas with morphological defects, consistent with the live phenotype and the Acridine orange staining pattern (Fig. 7C). These results indicate that the depletion of the long gpbp splice variant leads to massive programmed cell death predominantly in brain and muscle tissues. Ceramide Accumulation in the Gpbp Knockdown Embryos—It has been previously demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution in the CERT PH domain abolishes ceramide transfer between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex by preventing interaction of CERT with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in the Golgi membrane (3Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). To test whether aberrant ceramide transport is behind the observed Gpbp knockdown defects, we engineere"
https://openalex.org/W2115927750,"The neuronal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contributes to many physiological and pathological processes in the brain. A subset of dendritic spines on hippocampal neurons contains ER that may contribute to synapse-specific intracellular signaling. Distribution of ER to spines is dynamic, but knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms is lacking. In live cell imaging experiments we now show that cultured hippocampal neurons rapidly lost ER from spines after phorbol ester treatment. ER loss was reduced by inhibiting gamma-secretase (DAPT at 2 microM) and metalloproteinase (TAPI-0 and GM6001 at 4 microM) activity. Inhibition of protein kinase C also diminished loss of ER by preventing exit of ER from spines. Furthermore, gamma-secretase and metalloproteinase inhibition, in the absence of phorbol ester, triggered a dramatic increase in spine ER content. Metalloproteinases and gamma-secretase cleave several transmembrane proteins. Many of these substrates are known to localize to adherens junctions, a structural specialization with which spine ER interacts. One interesting possibility is thus that ER content within spines may be regulated by proteolytic activity affecting adherens junctions. Our data demonstrate a hitherto unknown role for these two proteolytic activities in regulating dynamic aspects of cellular ultrastructure, which is potentially important for cellular calcium homeostasis and several intracellular signaling pathways."
