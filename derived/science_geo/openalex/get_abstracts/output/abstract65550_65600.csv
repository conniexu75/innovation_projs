https://openalex.org/W1966395595,"Adult Lewis rats were thymectomized, irradiated, and restored with bone marrow from allogeneic (or F(1)) donors. They were passively sensitized to tuberculin by a subsequent transfer of Lewis lymph node cells and were given intradermal skin tests with tuberculoprotein. In 24-hour skin reactions the majority of cells, in successive experiments, were shown to be allogeneic (or F(1)) with the use of isoantibody against the antigens of the transplanted marrow cells and by the indirect fluorescent antibody technique. Our results demonstrate that the non-specific cells making up a large proportion of the infiltrating elements in tuberculin skin reactions probably originate in the bone marrow."
https://openalex.org/W1563319163,"The substitution of canavanine for arginine in an arginine auxotroph of Escherichia coli K-12 allowed protein synthesis to continue but inhibited the formation of the alkaline phosphatase. Sonically disrupted extracts of cells incubated with 14C-canavanine contained 14C-protein that precipitated with antibody specific to alkaline phosphatase subunits and a fraction of 14C-active enzyme that was distinct from native alkaline phosphatase. This radioactive enzyme was partially purified and shown to have many properties in common with native enzyme. Of the 20 to 22 arginines in alkaline phosphatase, at least 13 and possibly 18 or 19 of these were replaced by canavanine. Prelabeling of cells with 3H-arginine prior to replacement of canavanine in the medium showed that there were probably 1 to 3 arginines in the enzyme. About one-fourth of the alkaline phosphatase subunits formed in the presence of canavanine were found in the active dimer, and the remainder accumulated as inactive subunits in the cell's periplasmic space. The possible differences between the two classes of subunits are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1498507807,"Abstract A new type of fractionating step involving gel filtration is introduced for the purification of certain transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs). It is based on the increase that occurs in the molecular dimensions of these tRNAs when they are trapped, reversibly, in a denatured state under conditions where the other tRNA components of the mixture are in the native conformation. This step, coupled to countercurrent distribution, is used to obtain in a near homogeneous state a leucine-specific tRNA that cannot be so purified by countercurrent distribution alone, as several other tRNA species have very similar partition coefficients in the two-phase solvent system employed. The applicability of the same techniques for the partial purification of a methionine-, an arginine-, and a glutamine-specific tRNA from yeast is also demonstrated. The potential of this combination of methods for large scale fractionation of tRNA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1592802321,"Abstract Molecular weights for human pepsin and gastricsin are about 34,000 and 31,500, respectively, as determined by the sedimentation-diffusion method, sedimentation equilibrium studies, and amino acid analysis data. The sedimentation coefficients, s20,w, were found to be 3.14 S for human pepsin and 3.32 S for gastricsin. The sedimentation coefficient for gastricsin is concentration-dependent. The diffusion coefficients, D20,w, were found to be 8.7 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1 and 9.6 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1 for human pepsin and gastricsin, respectively. The partial specific volumes calculated from the amino acid compositions were 0.724 ml per g for human pepsin and 0.724 ml per g for gastricsin. The amino acid composition of human pepsin is very similar to that of procine pepsin. Human pepsin contains a significantly higher number of aspartic acid, isoleucine, and serine residues than gastricsin, while gastricsin contains a significantly higher number of glutamic acid residues."

https://openalex.org/W1586631089,"Abstract Alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-substituted monoesters of phosphorothioic acid of the type RSPO3Na2 (R = —CH2CH2NH2,—CH2CH2NHCOCH3,—CH2COOH, or—CH2CH2COOC2H5), at the S—P bond, to yield orthophosphate and the corresponding thioalcohols. The rate of enzymic hydrolysis of cysteamine S-phosphate was measured at different pH values and substrate concentrations. The pH profile of the rate of hydrolysis, as well as the Km and Vmax values obtained, are similar to the corresponding values obtained for p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Cysteamine S-phosphate competitively inhibits the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Inorganic phosphate and phosphorothioate competitively inhibit the enzymic hydrolysis of both cysteamine S-phosphate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Phosphorothioate is hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase, in a manner analogous to inorganic orthophosphate, to yield orthophosphate and hydrogen sulfide. It is suggested that cysteamine S-phosphate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate are bound to the same catalytic site of alkaline phosphatase."

Other substances capable of aggregating platelets include adenosine diphosphate (ADP)3, connective tissue4, and (in rabbit platelet systems) endotoxin5. I have compared these other aggregating substances with thrombin in their ability to influence platelet glycolysis as measured by the production of lactate."

https://openalex.org/W2060767239,Several recombinant types may be produced from a single Escherichia coli zygote when the donor parent is Hfr-Hayes and segregation is delayed; usually only one type is produced with Hfr-Cavalli. Statistical experiments confirm well-known pedigree analyses by micromanipulation and suggest that DNA synthesis is required before final genetic integration.

https://openalex.org/W2027566790,"IN the extensive experimentation that has involved the assay of β-galactosidase activity during the past 5 years it has been common practice to use thiols, and particularly β-mercaptoethanol. In our method of preparing this enzyme1 we use thioglycolate for the primary purpose of reducing large aggregates to a minimum. The substitution of β-mercaptoethanol in the preparative procedure, using strain ML308 as a source of β-galactosi-dase, has resulted in a variety of effects, one of which is a progressive inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W1975020877,"An RNA synthetase is formed in Escherichia coli after infection with bacteriophages containing RNA. Specific annealing techniques revealed that, from the very outset of the reaction in vitro, the partially purified enzyme-template complex synthesizes parental-type plus strands, namely, MS2-RNA when isolated from cells infected with MS2 phage and Qβ-RNA in the case of cells infected with Qβ phage. This is in contrast to the situation found with Qβ replicase primed with Qβ-RNA, where the initial product is the complementary strand."

https://openalex.org/W2028393606,"THE evolutionary origins of human DNA are expressed in the fact that some 20 per cent of it is identical with the DNA of other mammals, 8 per cent with that of birds and 5 per cent with that of fish1,3. A search for possible remnants of the bacterial genome in human chromosomal DNA by DNA-hybridization is complicated by the greatly unequal size of their genome: the human genome contains about 3.5 × 109 nucleotide pairs, whereas the bacterial genome, for example, that of Escherichia coli, has only some 5 × 106 nucleotide pairs. If any similarity exists it will therefore involve less than 0.2 per cent of the human genome. If labelled human DNA is used with ordinary bacterial DNA in agar, such low values are below the sensitivity of the DNA agar column method4. In these conditions no similarity has been found between labelled DNA from HeLa cells and E. coil-DNA3."

https://openalex.org/W1483144814,"Abstract Group C Streptococcus pyogenes (M4) produces large amounts of hyaluronic acid in its capsule. Occasional nonencapsulated (rough) forms, which do not synthesize hyaluronic acid, appear spontaneously on blood agar plates and are sufficiently stable for study. The mono- and diphosphonucleotides found in cold perchloric acid extracts of the encapsulated and nonencapsulated streptococci have been separated on an anion exchange resin column and identified. With one exception, they are found in approximately equal amounts in both extracts. A large amount of one compound consistently appears in extracts of the nonencapsulated bacteria and is not found in extracts of the encapsulated bacteria. This compound has been identified as uridine diphosphate N-acetyl muramic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2019578149,HEREDITARY immunity manifests itself in Escherichia coli treated with a cell free medium obtained from a stationary phase culture inoculated with a virulent phage. Immune bacteria have certain features which cannot be explained by selective or mutational processes. They become resistant to other related and unrelated virulent phages of the T-series as well as to the phage present in the cell free medium (infecting phage).
