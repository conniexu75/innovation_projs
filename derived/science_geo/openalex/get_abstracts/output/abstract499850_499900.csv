https://openalex.org/W2027150010,"The Hippo transducers YAP/TAZ have been shown to play positive, as well as negative, roles in Wnt signaling, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we provide biochemical, functional, and genetic evidence that YAP and TAZ are integral components of the β-catenin destruction complex that serves as cytoplasmic sink for YAP/TAZ. In Wnt-ON cells, YAP/TAZ are physically dislodged from the destruction complex, allowing their nuclear accumulation and activation of Wnt/YAP/TAZ-dependent biological effects. YAP/TAZ are required for intestinal crypt overgrowth induced by APC deficiency and for crypt regeneration ex vivo. In Wnt-OFF cells, YAP/TAZ are essential for β-TrCP recruitment to the complex and β-catenin inactivation. In Wnt-ON cells, release of YAP/TAZ from the complex is instrumental for Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In line, the β-catenin-dependent maintenance of ES cells in an undifferentiated state is sustained by loss of YAP/TAZ. This work reveals an unprecedented signaling framework relevant for organ size control, regeneration, and tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2132731072,"Whole-genome sequencing enables complete characterization of genetic variation, but geographic clustering of rare alleles demands many diverse populations be studied. Here we describe the Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL) Project, in which we sequenced the whole genomes of 250 Dutch parent-offspring families and constructed a haplotype map of 20.4 million single-nucleotide variants and 1.2 million insertions and deletions. The intermediate coverage (∼13×) and trio design enabled extensive characterization of structural variation, including midsize events (30–500 bp) previously poorly catalogued and de novo mutations. We demonstrate that the quality of the haplotypes boosts imputation accuracy in independent samples, especially for lower frequency alleles. Population genetic analyses demonstrate fine-scale structure across the country and support multiple ancient migrations, consistent with historical changes in sea level and flooding. The GoNL Project illustrates how single-population whole-genome sequencing can provide detailed characterization of genetic variation and may guide the design of future population studies."
https://openalex.org/W2000225222,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), memory impairment is the most prominent feature that afflicts patients and their families. Although reactive astrocytes have been observed around amyloid plaques since the disease was first described, their role in memory impairment has been poorly understood. Here, we show that reactive astrocytes aberrantly and abundantly produce the inhibitory gliotransmitter GABA by monoamine oxidase-B (Maob) and abnormally release GABA through the bestrophin 1 channel. In the dentate gyrus of mouse models of AD, the released GABA reduces spike probability of granule cells by acting on presynaptic GABA receptors. Suppressing GABA production or release from reactive astrocytes fully restores the impaired spike probability, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory in the mice. In the postmortem brain of individuals with AD, astrocytic GABA and MAOB are significantly upregulated. We propose that selective inhibition of astrocytic GABA synthesis or release may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for treating memory impairment in AD."
https://openalex.org/W1999522052,"Inclusions containing TDP43 are linked to pathologies in several neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and FTD. Pathogenic TDP43 mutations are now found to shorten the protein's half-life in individual neurons. Stimulating autophagy with inhibitors improves TDP43 clearance and localization. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have distinct clinical features but a common pathology—cytoplasmic inclusions rich in transactive response element DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP43). Rare TDP43 mutations cause ALS or FTD, but abnormal TDP43 levels and localization may cause disease even if TDP43 lacks a mutation. Here we show that individual neurons vary in their ability to clear TDP43 and are exquisitely sensitive to TDP43 levels. To measure TDP43 clearance, we developed and validated a single-cell optical method that overcomes the confounding effects of aggregation and toxicity and discovered that pathogenic mutations shorten TDP43 half-life. New compounds that stimulate autophagy improved TDP43 clearance and localization and enhanced survival in primary murine neurons and in human stem cell–derived neurons and astrocytes harboring mutant TDP43. These findings indicate that the levels and localization of TDP43 critically determine neurotoxicity and show that autophagy induction mitigates neurodegeneration by acting directly on TDP43 clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2116532772,"Hedgehog signaling drives oncogenesis in several cancers, and strategies targeting this pathway have been developed, most notably through inhibition of Smoothened (SMO). However, resistance to Smoothened inhibitors occurs by genetic changes of Smoothened or other downstream Hedgehog components. Here we overcome these resistance mechanisms by modulating GLI transcription through inhibition of bromo and extra C-terminal (BET) bromodomain proteins. We show that BRD4 and other BET bromodomain proteins regulate GLI transcription downstream of SMO and suppressor of fused (SUFU), and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies reveal that BRD4 directly occupies GLI1 and GLI2 promoters, with a substantial decrease in engagement of these sites after treatment with JQ1, a small-molecule inhibitor targeting BRD4. Globally, genes associated with medulloblastoma-specific GLI1 binding sites are downregulated in response to JQ1 treatment, supporting direct regulation of GLI activity by BRD4. Notably, patient- and GEMM (genetically engineered mouse model)-derived Hedgehog-driven tumors (basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor) respond to JQ1 even when harboring genetic lesions rendering them resistant to Smoothened antagonists. Altogether, our results reveal BET proteins as critical regulators of Hedgehog pathway transcriptional output and nominate BET bromodomain inhibitors as a strategy for treating Hedgehog-driven tumors with emerged or a priori resistance to Smoothened antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2134041631,"Hemispheric lateralization for language production and its relationships with manual preference and manual preference strength were studied in a sample of 297 subjects, including 153 left-handers (LH). A hemispheric functional lateralization index (HFLI) for language was derived from fMRI acquired during a covert sentence generation task as compared with a covert word list recitation. The multimodal HFLI distribution was optimally modeled using a mixture of 3 and 4 Gaussian functions in right-handers (RH) and LH, respectively. Gaussian function parameters helped to define 3 types of language hemispheric lateralization, namely “Typical” (left hemisphere dominance with clear positive HFLI values, 88% of RH, 78% of LH), “Ambilateral” (no dominant hemisphere with HFLI values close to 0, 12% of RH, 15% of LH) and “Strongly-atypical” (right-hemisphere dominance with clear negative HFLI values, 7% of LH). Concordance between dominant hemispheres for hand and for language did not exceed chance level, and most of the association between handedness and language lateralization was explained by the fact that all Strongly-atypical individuals were left-handed. Similarly, most of the relationship between language lateralization and manual preference strength was explained by the fact that Strongly-atypical individuals exhibited a strong preference for their left hand. These results indicate that concordance of hemispheric dominance for hand and for language occurs barely above the chance level, except in a group of rare individuals (less than 1% in the general population) who exhibit strong right hemisphere dominance for both language and their preferred hand. They call for a revisit of models hypothesizing common determinants for handedness and for language dominance."
https://openalex.org/W2078395913,"Polybrominated aromatic natural products are pervasive in the marine food web. Genetic and biochemical data now establish their biosynthetic origins in marine bacteria, revealing a physiological brominase that uses an unusual decarboxylative mechanism. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polybrominated bipyrroles are natural products that bioaccumulate in the marine food chain. PBDEs have attracted widespread attention because of their persistence in the environment and potential toxicity to humans. However, the natural origins of PBDE biosynthesis are not known. Here we report marine bacteria as producers of PBDEs and establish a genetic and molecular foundation for their production that unifies paradigms for the elaboration of bromophenols and bromopyrroles abundant in marine biota. We provide biochemical evidence of marine brominases revealing decarboxylative-halogenation enzymology previously unknown among halogenating enzymes. Biosynthetic motifs discovered in our study were used to mine sequence databases to discover unrealized marine bacterial producers of organobromine compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2071071105,"We analyzed 28 thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) using next-generation sequencing and identified a missense mutation (chromosome 7 c.74146970T>A) in GTF2I at high frequency in type A thymomas, a relatively indolent subtype. In a series of 274 TETs, we detected the GTF2I mutation in 82% of type A and 74% of type AB thymomas but rarely in the aggressive subtypes, where recurrent mutations of known cancer genes have been identified. Therefore, GTF2I mutation correlated with better survival. GTF2I β and δ isoforms were expressed in TETs, and both mutant isoforms were able to stimulate cell proliferation in vitro. Thymic carcinomas carried a higher number of mutations than thymomas (average of 43.5 and 18.4, respectively). Notably, we identified recurrent mutations of known cancer genes, including TP53, CYLD, CDKN2A, BAP1 and PBRM1, in thymic carcinomas. These findings will complement the diagnostic assessment of these tumors and also facilitate development of a molecular classification and assessment of prognosis and treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2042259492,"Metformin, a well known antidiabetic agent that improves peripheral insulin sensitivity, also elicits anti-inflammatory actions, but its mechanism is unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of metformin action in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophages. Metformin inhibited LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in a concentration-dependent manner and in parallel induction of activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3), a transcription factor and member of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein family. ATF-3 knockdown abolished the inhibitory effects of metformin on LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine production accompanied with reversal of metformin-induced suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. Conversely, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and NF-κB suppression by metformin were unaffected by ATF-3 knockdown. ChIP-PCR analysis revealed that LPS-induced NF-κB enrichments on the promoters of IL-6 and TNF-α were replaced by ATF-3 upon metformin treatment. AMPK knockdown blunted all the effects of metformin (ATF-3 induction, proinflammatory cytokine inhibition, and MAPK inactivation), suggesting that AMPK activation by metformin is required for and precedes ATF-3 induction. Oral administration of metformin to either mice with LPS-induced endotoxemia or ob/ob mice lowered the plasma and tissue levels of TNF-α and IL-6 and increased ATF-3 expression in spleen and lungs. These results suggest that metformin exhibits anti-inflammatory action in macrophages at least in part via pathways involving AMPK activation and ATF-3 induction."
https://openalex.org/W1988963409,"Chromosomal instability (CIN) is defined as the perpetual missegregation of whole chromosomes during mitosis and represents a hallmark of human cancer. However, the mechanisms influencing CIN and its consequences on tumour growth are largely unknown. We identified an increase in microtubule plus-end assembly rates as a mechanism influencing CIN in colorectal cancer cells. This phenotype is induced by overexpression of the oncogene AURKA or by loss of the tumour suppressor gene CHK2, a genetic constitution found in 73% of human colorectal cancers. Increased microtubule assembly rates are associated with transient abnormalities in mitotic spindle geometry promoting the generation of lagging chromosomes and influencing CIN. Reconstitution of proper microtubule assembly rates by chemical or genetic means suppresses CIN and thereby, unexpectedly, accelerates tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we identify a fundamental mechanism influencing CIN in cancer cells and reveal its adverse consequence on tumour growth."
https://openalex.org/W2002378374,"At hippocampal synapses, activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) induces long-term depression (LTD), which requires new protein synthesis. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we describe the translational program that underlies mGluR-LTD and identify the translation factor eIF2α as its master effector. Genetically reducing eIF2α phosphorylation, or specifically blocking the translation controlled by eIF2α phosphorylation, prevented mGluR-LTD and the internalization of surface AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Conversely, direct phosphorylation of eIF2α, bypassing mGluR activation, triggered a sustained LTD and removal of surface AMPARs. Combining polysome profiling and RNA sequencing, we identified the mRNAs translationally upregulated during mGluR-LTD. Translation of one of these mRNAs, oligophrenin-1, mediates the LTD induced by eIF2α phosphorylation. Mice deficient in phospho-eIF2α-mediated translation are impaired in object-place learning, a behavioral task that induces hippocampal mGluR-LTD in vivo. Our findings identify a new model of mGluR-LTD, which promises to be of value in the treatment of mGluR-LTD-linked cognitive disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1979200451,"The bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme containing σ factor initiates transcription at specific promoter sites by de novo RNA priming, the first step of RNA synthesis where RNAP accepts two initiating ribonucleoside triphosphates (iNTPs) and performs the first phosphodiester bond formation. We present the structure of de novo transcription initiation complex that reveals unique contacts of the iNTPs bound at the transcription start site with the template DNA and also with RNAP and demonstrate the importance of these contacts for transcription initiation. To get further insight into the mechanism of RNA priming, we determined the structure of initially transcribing complex of RNAP holoenzyme with 6-mer RNA, obtained by in crystallo transcription approach. The structure highlights RNAP-RNA contacts that stabilize the short RNA transcript in the active site and demonstrates that the RNA 5'-end displaces σ region 3.2 from its position near the active site, which likely plays a key role in σ ejection during the initiation-to-elongation transition. Given the structural conservation of the RNAP active site, the mechanism of de novo RNA priming appears to be conserved in all cellular RNAPs."

The realization of long-term human organ preservation will have groundbreaking effects on the current practice of transplantation. Herein we present a new technique based on subzero nonfreezing preservation and extracorporeal machine perfusion that allows transplantation of rat livers preserved for up to four days, thereby tripling the viable preservation duration."
https://openalex.org/W2146803302,"This Technical Report describes new methods of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in non-human primates. By combining single neuron recording with a modified TMS coil with focused stimulation in alert macaques, the authors show that this method can reduce stimulation artifact and allow investigation into the neuronal mechanisms of TMS. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely used, noninvasive method for stimulating nervous tissue, yet its mechanisms of effect are poorly understood. Here we report new methods for studying the influence of TMS on single neurons in the brain of alert non-human primates. We designed a TMS coil that focuses its effect near the tip of a recording electrode and recording electronics that enable direct acquisition of neuronal signals at the site of peak stimulus strength minimally perturbed by stimulation artifact in awake monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We recorded action potentials within ∼1 ms after 0.4-ms TMS pulses and observed changes in activity that differed significantly for active stimulation as compared with sham stimulation. This methodology is compatible with standard equipment in primate laboratories, allowing easy implementation. Application of these tools will facilitate the refinement of next generation TMS devices, experiments and treatment protocols."

https://openalex.org/W1998245413,"Excitatory synapses occur mainly on dendritic spines, and spine density is usually correlated with the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission. We report that Nr4a1, an activity-inducible gene encoding a nuclear receptor, regulates the density and distribution of dendritic spines in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Nr4a1 overexpression resulted in elimination of the majority of spines; however, postsynaptic densities were preserved on dendritic shafts, and the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission was unaffected, showing that excitatory synapses can be dissociated from spines. mRNA expression profiling studies suggest that Nr4a1-mediated transcriptional regulation of the actin cytoskeleton contributes to this effect. Under conditions of chronically elevated activity, when Nr4a1 was induced, Nr4a1 knockdown increased the density of spines and PSDs specifically at the distal ends of dendrites. Thus, Nr4a1 is a key component of an activity-induced transcriptional program that regulates the density and distribution of spines and synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2128923589,"Cerebral palsy (CP) of the spastic type is a neurological disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with exaggerated tendon jerks. Secondary to the spasticity, muscle adaptation is presumed to contribute to limitations in the passive range of joint motion. However, the mechanisms underlying these limitations are unknown. Using biopsies, we compared mechanical as well as histological properties of flexor carpi ulnaris muscle (FCU) from CP patients (n = 29) and healthy controls (n = 10). The sarcomere slack length (mean 2.5 µm, SEM 0.05) and slope of the normalized sarcomere length-tension characteristics of spastic fascicle segments and single myofibre segments were not different from those of control muscle. Fibre type distribution also showed no significant differences. Fibre size was significantly smaller (1933 µm2, SEM 190) in spastic muscle than in controls (2572 µm2, SEM 322). However, our statistical analyses indicate that the latter difference is likely to be explained by age, rather than by the affliction. Quantities of endomysial and perimysial networks within biopsies of control and spastic muscle were unchanged with one exception: a significant thickening of the tertiary perimysium (3-fold), i.e. the connective tissue reinforcement of neurovascular tissues penetrating the muscle. Note that this thickening in tertiary perimysium was shown in the majority of CP patients, however a small number of patients (n = 4 out of 23) did not have this feature. These results are taken as indications that enhanced myofascial loads on FCU is one among several factors contributing in a major way to the aetiology of limitation of movement at the wrist in CP and the characteristic wrist position of such patients."
https://openalex.org/W2030364710,"The centromedial amygdala (CeM), a subdivision of the central amygdala (CeA), is believed to be the main output station of the amygdala for fear expression. We provide evidence that the Tac2 gene, expressed by neurons specifically within the CeM, is required for modulating fear memories. Tac2 is colocalized with GAD65 and CaMKIIα but not with PKCd and Enk neurons in the CeM. Moreover, the Tac2 product, NkB, and its specific receptor, Nk3R, are also involved in the consolidation of fear memories. Increased Tac2 expression, through a stress-induced PTSD-like model, or following lentiviral CeA overexpression, are sufficient to enhance fear consolidation. This effect is blocked by the Nk3R antagonist osanetant. Concordantly, silencing of Tac2-expressing neurons in CeA with DREADDs impairs fear consolidation. Together, these studies further our understanding of the role of the Tac2 gene and CeM in fear processing and may provide approaches to intervention for fear-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2130962362,"The presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is critical for cholesterol metabolism in the brain, preventing uptake of lipoprotein-bound cholesterol from the circulation. The metabolic consequences of a leaking BBB for cholesterol metabolism have not been studied previously. Here we used a pericyte-deficient mouse model, Pdgfb(ret/ret), shown to have increased permeability of the BBB to a range of low-molecular mass and high-molecular mass tracers. There was a significant accumulation of plant sterols in the brains of the Pdgfb(ret/ret) mice. By dietary treatment with 0.3% deuterium-labeled cholesterol, we could demonstrate a significant flux of cholesterol from the circulation into the brains of the mutant mice roughly corresponding to about half of the measured turnover of cholesterol in the brain. We expected the cholesterol flux into the brain to cause a down-regulation of cholesterol synthesis. Instead, cholesterol synthesis was increased by about 60%. The levels of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) were significantly reduced in the brains of the pericyte-deficient mice but increased in the circulation. After treatment with 1% cholesterol in diet, the difference in cholesterol synthesis between mutants and controls disappeared. The findings are consistent with increased leakage of 24S-OHC from the brain into the circulation in the pericyte-deficient mice. This oxysterol is an efficient suppressor of cholesterol synthesis, and the results are consistent with a regulatory role of 24S-OHC in the brain. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a defective BBB may lead to increased flux of a lipophilic compound out from the brain. The relevance of the findings for the human situation is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2030588576,"Inhaled β-agonists are effective at reversing bronchoconstriction in asthma, but the mechanism by which they exert this effect is unclear and controversial. PKA is the historically accepted effector, although this assumption is made on the basis of associative and not direct evidence. Recent studies have asserted that exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac), not PKA, mediates the relaxation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) observed with β-agonist treatment. This study aims to clarify the role of PKA in the prorelaxant effects of β-agonists on ASM. Inhibition of PKA activity via expression of the PKI and RevAB peptides results in increased β-agonist-mediated cAMP release, abolishes the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol on histamine-induced intracellular calcium flux, and significantly attenuates histamine-stimulated MLC-20 phosphorylation. Analyses of ASM cell and tissue contraction demonstrate that PKA inhibition eliminates most, if not all, β-agonist-mediated relaxation of contracted smooth muscle. Conversely, Epac knockdown had no effect on the regulation of contraction or procontractile signaling by isoproterenol. These findings suggest that PKA, not Epac, is the predominant and physiologically relevant effector through which β-agonists exert their relaxant effects."
https://openalex.org/W2016539205,"Background The biological properties of thiosemicarbazone have been widely reported. The incorporation of some transition metals such as Fe, Ni and Cu to thiosemicarbazone complexes is known to enhance its biological effects. In this study, we incorporated nickel(II) ions into thiosemicarbazone with N4-substitution groups H3L (H; H3L1, CH3; H3L2, C6H5; H3L3 and C2H5; H3L4) and examined its potential anti-inflammatory activity. Methodology/Principal Findings Four ligands (1–4) and their respective nickel-containing complexes (5–8) were synthesized and characterized. The compounds synthesized were tested for their effects on NF-κB nuclear translocation, pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion and NF-κB transactivation activity. The active compound was further evaluated on its ability to suppress carrageenan-induced acute inflammation in vivo. A potential binding target of the active compound was also predicted by molecular docking analysis. Conclusions/Significance Among all synthesized compounds tested, we found that complex [Ni(H2L1)(PPh3)]Cl (5) (complex 5), potently inhibited IκBα degradation and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells as well as TNFα-stimulated HeLa S3 cells. In addition, complex 5 significantly down-regulated LPS- or TNFα-induced transcription of NF-κB target genes, including genes that encode the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IFNβ and IL6. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that complex 5 inhibited the transactivation activity of NF-κB. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effect of complex 5 was also supported by its suppressive effect on carrageenan-induced paw edema formation in wild type C57BL/6 mice. Interestingly, molecular docking study showed that complex 5 potentially interact with the active site of IKKβ. Taken together, we suggest complex 5 as a novel NF-κB inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory effects."
https://openalex.org/W2093747912,"Hesperidin, a natural flavonoid abundantly present in Citrus is known for its anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study we examined the effect of hesperidin on HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells treated with various concentration of hesperidin undergo a distinct type of programed cell death. Cytoplasmic vacuolization, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum swelling and uncondensed chromatin were observed in hesperidin treated cells. DNA electrophoresis show lack of DNA fragmentation and western blot analysis demonstrates lack of caspase activation and PARP cleavage. It was observed that hesperidin induced cell death is nonautophagic and also activate mitogen activated protein kinase ERK1/2. Taken together, the data indicate that hesperidin induces paraptosis like cell death in HepG2 cells with the activation of ERK1/2. Thus our finding suggests that hesperidin inducing paraptosis may offer an alternative tool in human liver carcinoma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1969689981,"Rabbits have been used extensively as a model system for the elucidation of the mechanism of immunoglobulin diversification and for the production of antibodies. We employed Next Generation Sequencing to analyze Ig germline V and J gene usage, CDR3 length and amino acid composition, and gene conversion frequencies within the functional (transcribed) IgG repertoire of the New Zealand white rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Several previously unannotated rabbit heavy chain variable (VH) and light chain variable (VL) germline elements were deduced bioinformatically using multidimensional scaling and k-means clustering methods. We estimated the gene conversion frequency in the rabbit at 23% of IgG sequences with a mean gene conversion tract length of 59±36 bp. Sequencing and gene conversion analysis of the chicken, human, and mouse repertoires revealed that gene conversion occurs much more extensively in the chicken (frequency 70%, tract length 79±57 bp), was observed to a small, yet statistically significant extent in humans, but was virtually absent in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2016605676,"An investigation was made of the adhesion, growth and differentiation of osteoblast-like MG-63 and Saos-2 cells on titanium (Ti) and niobium (Nb) supports and on TiNb alloy with surfaces oxidized at 165°C under hydrothermal conditions and at 600°C in a stream of air. The oxidation mode and the chemical composition of the samples tuned the morphology, topography and distribution of the charge on their surfaces, which enabled us to evaluate the importance of these material characteristics in the interaction of the cells with the sample surface. Numbers of adhered MG-63 and Saos-2 cells correlated with the number of positively-charged (related with the Nb2O5 phase) and negatively-charged sites (related with the TiO2 phase) on the alloy surface. Proliferation of these cells is correlated with the presence of positively-charged (i.e. basic) sites of the Nb2O5 alloy phase, while cell differentiation is correlated with negatively-charged (acidic) sites of the TiO2 alloy phase. The number of charged sites and adhered cells was substantially higher on the alloy sample oxidized at 600°C than on the hydrothermally treated sample at 165°C. The expression values of osteoblast differentiation markers (collagen type I and osteocalcin) were higher for cells grown on the Ti samples than for those grown on the TiNb samples. This was more particularly apparent in the samples treated at 165°C. No considerable immune activation of murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells on the tested samples was found. The secretion of TNF-α by these cells into the cell culture media was much lower than for either cells grown in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, or untreated control samples. Thus, oxidized Ti and TiNb are both promising materials for bone implantation; TiNb for applications where bone cell proliferation is desirable, and Ti for induction of osteogenic cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2090083014,"The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor 1A, p21/Cip1, is a vital cell cycle regulator, dysregulation of which has been associated with a large number of human malignancies. One critical mechanism that controls p21 function is through its degradation, which allows the activation of its associated cell cycle-promoting kinases, CDK2 and CDK4. Thus delineating how p21 is stabilized and degraded will enhance our understanding of cell growth control and offer a basis for potential therapeutic interventions. Here we report a novel regulatory mechanism that controls the dynamic status of p21 through its interaction with Cdk5 and Abl enzyme substrate 1 (Cables1). Cables1 has a proposed role as a tumor suppressor. We found that upregulation of Cables1 protein was correlated with increased half-life of p21 protein, which was attributed to Cables1/p21 complex formation and supported by their co-localization in the nucleus. Mechanistically, Cables1 interferes with the proteasome (Prosome, Macropain) subunit alpha type 3 (PSMA3) binding to p21 and protects p21 from PSMA3-mediated proteasomal degradation. Moreover, silencing of p21 partially reverses the ability of Cables1 to induce cell death and inhibit cell proliferation. In further support of a potential pathophysiological role of Cables1, the expression level of Cables1 is tightly associated with p21 in both cancer cell lines and human lung cancer patient tumor samples. Together, these results suggest Cables1 as a novel p21 regulator through maintaining p21 stability and support the model that the tumor-suppressive function of Cables1 occurs at least in part through enhancing the tumor-suppressive activity of p21."
https://openalex.org/W2007390895,"Src non-receptor kinases have been implicated in events late in tumor progression. Here, we study the role of Src kinases in the Drosophila intestinal stem cell (ISC) lineage, during tissue homeostasis and tumor onset. The adult Drosophila intestine contains only two progenitor cell types, division-capable ISCs and their daughters, postmitotic enteroblasts (EBs). We found that Drosophila Src42a and Src64b were required for optimal regenerative ISC division. Conversely, activation of Src42a, Src64b or another non-receptor kinase, Ack, promoted division of quiescent ISCs by coordinately stimulating G1/S and G2/M cell cycle phase progression. Prolonged Src kinase activation caused tissue overgrowth owing to cytokine receptor-independent Stat92E activation. This was not due to increased symmetric division of ISCs, but involved accumulation of weakly specified Notch+ but division-capable EB-like cells. Src activation triggered expression of a mitogenic module consisting of String/Cdc25 and Cyclin E that was sufficient to elicit division not only of ISCs but also of EBs. A small pool of similarly division-capable transit-amplifying Notch+ EBs was also identified in the wild type. Expansion of intermediate cell types that do not robustly manifest their transit-amplifying potential in the wild type may also contribute to regenerative growth and tumor development in other tissues in other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2030678455,"The prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer is poor in part due to the high frequency of chemoresistance. Recent evidence points to the Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), and particularly its adaptor protein MyD88, as one potential mediator of this resistance. This study aims to provide further evidence that MyD88 positive cancer cells are clinically significant, stem-like and reproducibly detectable for the purposes of prognostic stratification. Expression of TLR4 and MyD88 was assessed immunohistochemically in 198 paraffin-embedded ovarian tissues and in an embryonal carcinoma model of cancer stemness. In parallel, expression of TLR4 and MyD88 mRNA and regulatory microRNAs (miR-21 and miR-146a) was assessed, as well as in a series of chemosensitive and resistant cancer cells lines. Functional analysis of the pathway was assessed in chemoresistant SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. TLR4 and MyD88 expression can be reproducibly assessed via immunohistochemistry using a semi-quantitative scoring system. TLR4 expression was present in all ovarian epithelium (normal and neoplastic), whereas MyD88 was restricted to neoplastic cells, independent of tumour grade and associated with reduced progression-free and overall survival, in an immunohistological specific subset of serous carcinomas, p<0.05. MiR-21 and miR-146a expression was significantly increased in MyD88 negative cancers (p<0.05), indicating their participation in regulation. Significant alterations in MyD88 mRNA expression were observed between chemosensitive and chemoresistant cells and tissue. Knockdown of TLR4 in SKOV-3 ovarian cells recovered chemosensitivity. Knockdown of MyD88 alone did not. MyD88 expression was down-regulated in differentiated embryonal carcinoma (NTera2) cells, supporting the MyD88+ cancer stem cell hypothesis. Our findings demonstrate that expression of MyD88 is associated with significantly reduced patient survival and altered microRNA levels and suggest an intact/functioning TLR4/MyD88 pathway is required for acquisition of the chemoresistant phenotype.

In the present study, a set of nine microsatellite markers was developed and used to investigate the spatio-temporal genetic patterns of the holoplanktonic jellyfish Pelagia noctiluca (Scyphozoa) in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea. Homozygote excess was detected at eight loci, and individuals exhibited intra-population relatedness higher than expected by chance in at least three samples. This result was supported by the presence of siblings in at least 5 out 8 samples, 4 of which contained full-sib in addition to half-sib dyads. Having tested and ruled out alternative explanations as null alleles, our results suggest the influence of reproductive and behavioural features in shaping the genetic structure of P. noctiluca, as outcomes of population genetics analyses pointed out. Indeed, the genetic differentiation among populations was globally small but highlighted: a) a spatial genetic patchiness uncorrelated with distance between sampling locations, and b) a significant genetic heterogeneity between samples collected in the same locations in different years. Therefore, despite its extreme dispersal potential, P. noctiluca does not maintain a single homogenous population, but rather these jellyfish appear to have intra-bloom localized recruitment and/or individual cohesiveness, whereby siblings more likely swarm together as a single group and remain close after spawning events. These findings provide the first evidence of family structures and consequent genetic patchiness in a species with highly dispersive potential throughout its whole life cycle, contributing to understanding the patterns of dispersal and connectivity in marine environments."
https://openalex.org/W2020525459,"Glycosylation is among the most common and complex post-translational modifications identified to date. It proceeds through the catalytic action of multiple enzyme families that include the glycosyltransferases that add monosaccharides to growing glycans, and glycosidases which remove sugar residues to trim glycans. The expression level and specificity of these enzymes, in part, regulate the glycan distribution or glycome of specific cell/tissue systems. Currently, there is no systematic method to describe the enzymes and cellular reaction networks that catalyze glycosylation. To address this limitation, we present a streamlined machine-readable definition for the glycosylating enzymes and additional methodologies to construct and analyze glycosylation reaction networks. In this computational framework, the enzyme class is systematically designed to store detailed specificity data such as enzymatic functional group, linkage and substrate specificity. The new classes and their associated functions enable both single-reaction inference and automated full network reconstruction, when given a list of reactants and/or products along with the enzymes present in the system. In addition, graph theory is used to support functions that map the connectivity between two or more species in a network, and that generate subset models to identify rate-limiting steps regulating glycan biosynthesis. Finally, this framework allows the synthesis of biochemical reaction networks using mass spectrometry (MS) data. The features described above are illustrated using three case studies that examine: i) O-linked glycan biosynthesis during the construction of functional selectin-ligands; ii) automated N-linked glycosylation pathway construction; and iii) the handling and analysis of glycomics based MS data. Overall, the new computational framework enables automated glycosylation network model construction and analysis by integrating knowledge of glycan structure and enzyme biochemistry. All the implemented features are provided as part of the Glycosylation Network Analysis Toolbox (GNAT), an open-source, platform-independent, MATLAB based toolbox for studies of Systems Glycobiology."
https://openalex.org/W1974301051,"The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a non-human primate that could prove useful as human pharmacokinetic and biomedical research models. The cytochromes P450 (P450s) are a superfamily of enzymes that have critical roles in drug metabolism and disposition via monooxygenation of a broad range of xenobiotics; however, information on some marmoset P450s is currently limited. Therefore, identification and quantitative analysis of tissue-specific mRNA transcripts, including those of P450s and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO, another monooxygenase family), need to be carried out in detail before the marmoset can be used as an animal model in drug development. De novo assembly and expression analysis of marmoset transcripts were conducted with pooled liver, intestine, kidney, and brain samples from three male and three female marmosets. After unique sequences were automatically aligned by assembling software, the mean contig length was 718 bp (with a standard deviation of 457 bp) among a total of 47,883 transcripts. Approximately 30% of the total transcripts were matched to known marmoset sequences. Gene expression in 18 marmoset P450- and 4 FMO-like genes displayed some tissue-specific patterns. Of these, the three most highly expressed in marmoset liver were P450 2D-, 2E-, and 3A-like genes. In extrahepatic tissues, including brain, gene expressions of these monooxygenases were lower than those in liver, although P450 3A4 (previously P450 3A21) in intestine and P450 4A11- and FMO1-like genes in kidney were relatively highly expressed. By means of massive parallel long-read sequencing and short-read technology applied to marmoset liver, intestine, kidney, and brain, the combined next-generation sequencing analyses reported here were able to identify novel marmoset drug-metabolizing P450 transcripts that have until now been little reported. These results provide a foundation for mechanistic studies and pave the way for the use of marmosets as model animals for drug development in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2011398618,"Background The normal development of the uteroplacental circulation in pregnancy depends on angiogenic and vasodilatory factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Reduced uterine artery blood flow (UABF) is a common cause of fetal growth restriction; abnormalities in angiogenic factors are implicated. Previously we showed that adenovirus (Ad)-mediated VEGF-A165 expression in the pregnant sheep uterine artery (UtA) increased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression, altered vascular reactivity and increased UABF. VEGF-D is a VEGF family member that promotes angiogenesis and vasodilatation but, in contrast to VEGF-A, does not increase vascular permeability. Here we examined the effect of Ad.VEGF-DΔNΔC vector encoding a fully processed form of VEGF-D, on the uteroplacental circulation. Methods UtA transit-time flow probes and carotid artery catheters were implanted in mid-gestation pregnant sheep (n = 5) to measure baseline UABF and maternal haemodynamics respectively. 7–14 days later, after injection of Ad.VEGF-DΔNΔC vector (5×1011 particles) into one UtA and an Ad vector encoding β-galactosidase (Ad.LacZ) contralaterally, UABF was measured daily until scheduled post-mortem examination at term. UtAs were assessed for vascular reactivity, NOS expression and endothelial cell proliferation; NOS expression was studied in ex vivo transduced UtA endothelial cells (UAECs). Results At 4 weeks post-injection, Ad.VEGF-DΔNΔC treated UtAs showed significantly lesser vasoconstriction (Emax144.0 v/s 184.2, p = 0.002). There was a tendency to higher UABF in Ad.VEGF-DΔNΔC compared to Ad.LacZ transduced UtAs (50.58% v/s 26.94%, p = 0.152). There was no significant effect on maternal haemodynamics. An increased number of proliferating endothelial cells and adventitial blood vessels were observed in immunohistochemistry. Ad.VEGF-DΔNΔC expression in cultured UAECs upregulated eNOS and iNOS expression. Conclusions Local over-expression of VEGF-DΔNΔC in the UtAs of pregnant mid-gestation sheep reduced vasoconstriction, promoted endothelial cell proliferation and showed a trend towards increased UABF. Studies in cultured UAECs indicate that VEGF-DΔNΔC may act in part through upregulation of eNOS and iNOS."
https://openalex.org/W2028590485,"Disgust can be considered a psychological arm of the immune system that acts to prevent exposure to infectious agents. High disgust sensitivity is associated with greater behavioral avoidance of disease vectors and thus may reduce infection risk. A cross-sectional survey in rural Bangladesh provided no strong support for this hypothesis. In many species, the expression of pathogen- and predator-avoidance mechanisms is contingent on early life exposure to predators and pathogens. Using childhood health data collected in the 1990s, we examined if adults with more infectious diseases in childhood showed greater adult disgust sensitivity: no support for this association was found. Explanations for these null finding and possible directions for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2013952812,"Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast is a rare subtype of breast cancer that is associated with a high incidence of regional lymph node metastases and a poor clinical outcome. However, the clinico-pathological features and prognostic factors of IMPC are not well understood.A total of 188 IMPC cases and 1,289 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cases were included. The clinical features, breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and recurrence/metastasis-free survival (RFS) of the patients were compared between these two groups.The IMPC patients exhibited more features of aggressive carcinoma than the IDC patients, including larger tumor size, higher tumor stage, a greater proportion of nodal involvement and an increased incidence of lymphovascular invasion. Patients with IMPC had lower 5-year BCSS and RFS rates (75.9% and 67.1%, respectively) than patients with IDC (89.5% and 84.5%, respectively). Compared to IDC patients, the patients with IMPC had a significantly higher percentage of stage III breast cancer (51.3% versus 21.7%). In a stage-matched Kaplan-Meier analysis, the patients with stage III IMPC had lower 5-year BCSS and RFS rates than patients with stage III IDC (BCSS, P = 0.004; RFS, P = 0.034). A multivariate analysis revealed that TNM stage was an independent prognostic factor for patients with IMPC. The proportion of cancers with a luminal-like subtype was significantly higher in IMPC than in IDC (P<0.001). However, after matching by molecular subtype, the patients with IMPC had significantly worse clinical outcomes than patients with IDC.In Chinese women, IMPCs displayed more aggressive behaviors than IDCs, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes for patients with IMPC, regardless of a favorable molecular subtype. Our findings illustrate that the poorer survival of patients with IMPC might be due to an increased incidence and aggressiveness of tumors in TNM stage III."
https://openalex.org/W2110473626,"Members of the cytochrome P450 family are important metabolic enzymes that are present in all metazoans. Genes encoding cytochrome P450s form a multi-gene family, and the number of genes varies widely among species. The enzymes are classified as either biosynthesis- or detoxification-type, depending on their substrates, but their origin and evolution have not been fully understood. In order to elucidate the birth and death process of cytochrome P450 genes, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of 710 sequences from 14 vertebrate genomes and 543 sequences from 6 invertebrate genomes. Our results showed that vertebrate detoxification-type genes have independently emerged three times from biosynthesis-type genes and that invertebrate detoxification-type genes differ from vertebrates in their origins. Biosynthetic-type genes exhibit more conserved evolutionary processes than do detoxification-type genes, with regard to the rate of gene duplication, pseudogenization, and amino acid substitution. The differences in the evolutionary mode between biosynthesis- and detoxification-type genes may reflect differences in their respective substrates. The phylogenetic tree also revealed 11 clans comprising an upper category to families in the cytochrome P450 nomenclature. Here, we report novel clan-specific amino acids that may be used for the qualitative definition of clans."

During diastole, when cytosolic calcium is low, the role of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) within the cTn complex is to prevent the generation of force by inhibiting the interaction between the thick and thin filaments. Conversely, this inhibition is relieved when cytosolic calcium rises and binds to cardiac troponin C (cTnC) within the cTn complex (12.Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Regulation of contraction in striated muscle.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), mediated by β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, is responsible for the positive inotropic, chronotropic, and lusitropic effects on cardiac muscle dynamics (13.Kranias E.G.

Similar to human HCM patients, the mice developed a remarkable degree of hypertrophy and fibrosis (26.Wang Y. Pinto J.R. Solis R.S. Dweck D. Liang J. Diaz-Perez Z. Ge Y. Walker J.W. Potter J.D.

In a series of biochemical and proteomic assays, we demonstrated that cardiac fibers isolated from the homozygous mice were incapable of becoming phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro (by PKA) at serines 23 and 24 of cTnI due to the R21C mutation disrupting the PKA consensus sequence. Permeabilized cardiac fibers prepared from the R21C KI mice and WT littermates had comparable Ca2+ dependences of tension. However, unlike the WT, the R21C fibers were unable to decrease the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation after incubation with PKA. These experiments confirmed an initial report that showed that recombinant cTnI-R21C blunts the PKA-mediated myofilament Ca2+ desensitization when reconstituted in skinned cardiac fibers (27.Gomes A.V. Harada K. Potter J.D. A mutation in the N-terminus of troponin I that is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affects the Ca2+-sensitivity, phosphorylation kinetics and proteolytic susceptibility of troponin.J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 39: 754-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on the above, we rationalized that one mechanism by which HCM can manifest is through impairing the phosphorylation of cTnI and, consequently, blunting its lusitropic effects. In the present study, we show that the homozygous R21C KI mice develop HCM late by recapitulating the aberrant morphologic, hemodynamic, and electrocardiographic properties accompanying the human disease phenotype. We begin to explore the cardiac autonomic regulation of R21C KI mice hearts and reveal some of the molecular and cellular events that are triggered in response to an impaired β-agonist-induced myofilament relaxation. The results herein demonstrate that the phosphorylation of cTnI by PKA is critical in maintaining normal cardiac diastolic function, preventing hypertrophy and, to some extent, adequate heart rate modulation. All protocols and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Miami and the Florida State University following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health Publication 85-234, revised 1996).

Two age groups of mice were used in our investigation and are categorized as follows: young (∼6 months old) and old (between 12 and 15 months old). Young and old male R21C and WT littermate mice (n = 9, for each genotype and age group, totaling 36 mice) were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2%) and prepared for ECHO to assess the electrocardiographic and hemodynamic changes induced by the KI mutation. M-mode imaging (Vevo 2100, VisualSonics) of the parasternal short axis view was used to evaluate systolic and diastolic dimensions as well as posterior wall thickness. M-mode imaging was also used to calculate fractional shortening and ejection fraction. A four-chamber view was used to acquire mitral valve flow parameters. Pulsed wave spectral Doppler was used to measure mitral valve inflow, including its two main waves, early (E wave) and late atrial (A wave), from which deceleration time and isovolumetric relaxation time were derived. Mitral valve inflow parameters were used as an index of diastolic function (28.Oh J.K. Hatle L. Tajik A.J. Little W.C. Diastolic heart failure can be diagnosed by comprehensive two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography.J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2006; 47: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Ten old and weight-matched male R21C and WT littermate mice were used in this experiment. ECGs were recorded non-invasively in conscious mice using the ECGenie system recording platform (Mouse Specifics, Boston, MA). We evaluated cardiac autonomic modulation before and after β-AR stimulation with an intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol (ISO; 2.5 μg/g; Sigma) dissolved in 0.1 ml. ECGs were recorded within 5 min prior to each injection and between 1 and 3 min after each injection to capture the peak of the response to the drug (29.Desai K.H. Sato R. Schauble E. Barsh G.S. Kobilka B.K. Bernstein D. Cardiovascular indexes in the mouse at rest and with exercise: new tools to study models of cardiac disease.Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1053-H1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were gently removed from their cages and positioned on the ECG recording platform. Three gel-coated ECG electrodes (Red Dot; 3M, St. Paul, MN) are embedded in the floor of the platform and spaced (3 cm) to provide contact between the electrodes and the animal's paws. This configuration provides an ECG wave similar to an Eithenoven lead I. After a 30-min acclimation or heart rate (HR) equilibration period, ECG signals were recorded for 2–3 s (25–39 QRS complexes) while the mice passively established contact between the underside of its paws and the electrodes. Data acquisition was carried out using a proprietary Mouse Acquisition Module (Mouse Specifics). The signals are digitized with a 16-bit pre-a sampling rate of 2500 Hz. Analysis of individual ECGs was performed using the EzCG Analysis Software Package (Mouse Specifics). Body temperatures were measured using an infrared thermometer to verify consistency before and after taking ECG readings. The HRV was accessed following established guidelines (30.Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology Heart rate variability: standards of measurement, physiological interpretation and clinical use.Circulation. 1996; 93: 1043-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Thireau J.

These are considered markers of cardiac parasympathetic (vagal) modulation. The frequency domains, high frequency component (HF; 1.5–4.0 Hz; vagal modulation), and low frequency component (LF; 0.4–1.5 Hz; vagal-sympathetic interplay and baroreflex function) (32.Rahman F.

Cardiomyocytes (CMs) were isolated from young and old R21C and WT mice (n = 3 for each genotype and age group). Mice were first anesthetized with isoflurane and then injected intravenously with propranolol (1 mg/kg body weight; Calbiochem). After 30 min, they were given another exposure to isoflurane before cervical dislocation (26.Wang Y. Pinto J.R. Solis R.S. Dweck D. Liang J. Diaz-Perez Z. Ge Y. Walker J.W. Potter J.D.

Chem. 2012; 287: 2156-2167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hearts were excised, and CMs were isolated by enzymatic retrograde perfusion through the aorta as described previously (33.Khan S.A. Skaf M.W. Harrison R.W. Lee K. Minhas K.M. Kumar A. Fradley M. Shoukas A.A. Berkowitz D.E. Hare J.M. Nitric oxide regulation of myocardial contractility and calcium cycling: independent impact of neuronal and endothelial nitric oxide synthases.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1322-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). CMs were incubated with Fura-2/AM (Invitrogen), followed by continuous superperfusion with Tyrode's solution containing 1.8 mmol/liter Ca2+. Sarcomere length (SL) and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transients were recorded with an IonOptix iCCD camera outfitted with the IonOptix Hyper SwitchTM dual-excitation filter (IonOptix LLC, Milton, MA). Fura-2 was excited at 340 and 380 nm, and the ratio of the emissions at 510 nm (i.e. Fura-2 ratio) represents the amount of [Ca2+]i. SL and [Ca2+]i transients were measured in CMs paced from 0.5 to 4 Hz as described previously (34.Dulce R.A. Yiginer O. Gonzalez D.R. Goss G. Feng N. Zheng M. Hare J.M. Hydralazine and organic nitrates restore impaired excitation-contraction coupling by reducing calcium leak associated with nitroso-redox imbalance.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 6522-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To estimate diastolic SL relaxation and Ca2+ removal, the time constant of relaxation, t½ was used. To assess the response to β-AR stimulation, 100 nmol/liter ISO was added to the above Tyrode's perfusion solution for 10 min before acquiring the data. Following the pacing protocol, electrical stimulation was stopped, and the superfusing solution was switched to a Na+- and Ca2+-free solution to avoid Ca2+ fluxes through the sarcolemma. Then a rapid pulse of 20 mm caffeine was applied in order to assess the SR Ca2+ content as described previously (35.Bassani R.A. Bassani J.W. Bers D.M. Mitochondrial and sarcolemmal Ca2+ transport reduce [Ca2+]i during caffeine contractures in rabbit cardiac myocytes.J. Physiol. 1992; 453: 591-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The in vivo calibration was performed by superfusing a free Ca2+ solution containing 10 μmol/liter ionomycin (Sigma) until a minimal value of fluorescence (Rmin) was reached. Then the myocytes were superfused with Tyrode's solution containing ionomycin and a saturating [Ca2+] (5 mm CaCl2) until a maximal value of fluorescence (Rmax) was reached. [Ca2+]i was calculated using calibration Equation 1, [Ca2+]i=Kd(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R))(Sf2/Sb2)(Eq. 1) where the Kd (dissociation constant), Rmin, and Rmax were measured experimentally in adult myocytes and were 224 nmol/liter, 0.179, and 0.788, respectively. The Ca2+-free and -bound scaling factors, Sf2 and Sb2, are 2059 and 1264, respectively, and were derived from calibration as described previously (36.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. A new generation of Ca2+ indicators with greatly improved fluorescence properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). SR Ca2+ content was calculated considering that the SR represents 3.5% and the cytosol represents 65% of the myocyte's volume and fit to Equation 2, as described previously (37.Shannon T.R. Ginsburg K.S. Bers D.M. Quantitative assessment of the SR Ca2+ leak-load relationship.Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), [Ca2+]SR=[Ca2+]caff+((Bmax−SR[Ca2+]caff)/([Ca2+]caff+Kd−SR))(Eq. 2) where [Ca2+]SR is the SR Ca2+ content, [Ca2+]caff is the SR Ca2+ released by caffeine, and Bmax-SR and Kd-SR are the usual Michaelis parameters for intra-SR Ca2+ binding. Young WT and R21C mice were sacrificed as above after a propranolol injection. Skinned cardiac fibers (∼0.15 mm in diameter) isolated from WT and R21C mouse hearts were mounted onto a force transducer system (38.Güth K. Potter J.D. Effect of rigor and cycling cross-bridges on the structure of troponin C and on the Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+-specific regulatory sites in skinned rabbit psoas fibers.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13627-13635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fibers were chemically skinned with 1.0% Triton X-100 in pCa 8 (containing 10−8 mol/liter free [Ca2+]) solution for 30 min in order to remove membranes and organelles. Triton X-100 was removed by successive washes in pCa 8.0 solution prior to measuring the maximal force in pCa 4 (containing 10−4 mol/liter free [Ca2+]) contracting solution. To assess the effect of PKA-mediated phosphorylation on muscle relaxation, fibers were incubated with 0.5 units/μl of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Sigma) for 30 min in pCa 8 relaxing solution as described previously (26.Wang Y. Pinto J.R. Solis R.S. Dweck D. Liang J. Diaz-Perez Z. Ge Y. Walker J.W. Potter J.D.

Chem. 2012; 287: 2156-2167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thereafter, fibers were incubated in a solution containing (mmol/liter) 2 Diazo-2 (Molecular Probes), 0.5 CaCl2, 60 TES (pH 7.0), 5 MgATP2−, 1 MgPr2, 10 creatine phosphate, along with 15 units/ml creatine phosphokinase in the cuvette surrounding the fiber (22.Zhang R. Zhao J. Mandveno A. Potter J.D. Cardiac troponin I phosphorylation increases the rate of cardiac muscle relaxation.Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). At the ratio of total added Ca2+ to Diazo-2 given above, the resulting average initial force was ∼80% of the initial force seen in the pCa 4 contracting solution. The fibers were flashed with a UV light to convert the Diazo-2 from a low to a high affinity Ca2+ chelator, which rapidly induces muscle relaxation (39.Simnett S.J. Johns E.C. Lipscomb S. Mulligan I.P. Ashley C.C. Effect of pH, phosphate, and ADP on relaxation of myocardium after photolysis of diazo 2.Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H951-H960PubMed Google Scholar). Each measurement was normalized to the maximal force in pCa 4, and the data were fit to Equation 3, Y=A1e−B1Xi+A2e−B2Xi(Eq. 3) where Y is the quantity (i.e. relative force) at time Xi, A1 and A2 are the percentage amplitudes"
https://openalex.org/W1995034764,"Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) is the calcium sensor for synchronous neurotransmitter release. The two C2 domains of Syt1, which may mediate fusion by bridging the vesicle and plasma membranes, are connected to the vesicle membrane by a 60-residue linker. Here, we use site-directed spin labeling and a novel total internal reflection fluorescence vesicle binding assay to characterize the juxtamembrane linker and to test the ability of reconstituted full-length Syt1 to interact with opposing membrane surfaces. EPR spectroscopy demonstrates that the majority of the linker interacts with the membrane interface, thereby limiting the extension of the C2A and C2B domains into the cytoplasm. Pulse dipolar EPR spectroscopy provides evidence that purified full-length Syt1 is oligomerized in the membrane, and mutagenesis indicates that a glycine zipper/GXXXG motif within the linker helps mediate oligomerization. The total internal reflection fluorescence-based vesicle binding assay demonstrates that full-length Syt1 that is reconstituted into supported lipid bilayers will capture vesicles containing negatively charged lipid in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Moreover, the rate of vesicle capture increases with Syt1 density, and mutations in the GXXXG motif that inhibit oligomerization of Syt1 reduce the rate of vesicle capture. This work demonstrates that modifications within the 60-residue linker modulate both the oligomerization of Syt1 and its ability to interact with opposing bilayers. In addition to controlling its activity, the oligomerization of Syt1 may play a role in organizing proteins within the active zone of membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2093111601,"Tibetan kefir grains (TKGs), a kind of natural starter for fermented milk in Tibet, China, host various microorganisms of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, and occasionally acetic acid bacteria in a polysaccharide/protein matrix. In the present study, the fine structure of TKGs was studied to shed light on this unusual symbiosis with stereomicroscopy and thin sections. The results reveal that TKGs consist of numerous small grain units, which are characterized by a hollow globular structure with a diameter between 2.0 and 9.0 mm and a wall thickness of approximately 200 µm. A polyhedron-like net structure, formed mainly by the bacteria, was observed in the wall of the grain units, which has not been reported previously to our knowledge. Towards the inside of the grain unit, the polyhedron-like net structures became gradually larger in diameter and fewer in number. Such fine structures may play a crucial role in the stability of the grains. Subsequently, the distribution, diversity, and shift of yeasts in TKGs were investigated based on thin section, scanning electron microscopy, cloning and sequencing of D1/D2 of the 26S rRNA gene, real-time quantitative PCR, and in situ hybridization with specific fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide probes. These show that (i) yeasts appear to localize on the outer surface of the grains and grow normally together to form colonies embedded in the bacterial community; (ii) the diversity of yeasts is relatively low on genus level with three dominant species – Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces marxianus, and Yarrowia lipolytica; (iii) S. cerevisiae is the stable predominant yeast species, while the composition of Kluyveromyces and Yarrowia are subject to change over time. Our results indicate that TKGs are relatively stable in structure, and culture conditions to some extent shape the microbial community and interaction in kefir grains. These findings pave the way for further study of the specific symbiotic associations between S. cerevisiae and Lactobacillus bacteria in TKGs."
https://openalex.org/W1963749004,"The heterogeneity among multiple ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions within the same patient also diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) has not been well evaluated, leaving research implications of intra-individual DCIS heterogeneity yet to be explored. In this study formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections from 36 patients concurrently diagnosed with DCIS and IDC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Ten DCIS lesions from each patient were then randomly selected and scored. Our results showed that expression of PR, HER2, Ki-67, and p16 varied significantly within DCIS lesions from a single patient (P<0.05 for PR; P<1×10(-8) for HER2, Ki-67 and p16). In addition, seventy-two percent of the individuals had heterogeneous expression of at least 2/6 markers. Importantly, by evaluating the expression of promising DCIS risk biomarkers (Ki-67, p53 and p16) among different DCIS subgroups classified by comparing DCIS molecular subtypes with those of adjacent normal terminal duct lobular units (TDLU) and IDC, our results suggest the existence of a highly-aggressive DCIS subgroup, which had the same molecular subtype as the adjacent IDC but not the same subtype as the adjacent normal TDLU. By using a systematic approach, our results clearly demonstrate that intra-individual heterogeneity in DCIS is very common in patients concurrently diagnosed with IDC. Our novel findings of a DCIS subpopulation with aggressive characteristics will provide a new paradigm for mechanistic studies of breast tumor progression and also have broad implications for prevention research as heterogeneous pre-invasive lesions are present in many other cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W1971364905,"Studies in both pathological and healthy samples have suggested altered functional connectivity between orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala as a possible cause of anger and aggression. In patient populations presenting with pathological aggression, there is also evidence for changes in structural connectivity between OFC and amygdala. In healthy samples, however, the relationship between white matter integrity and aggression has not been studied to date. Here, we investigated the relationship between trait aggressiveness and structural OFC-amygdala connectivity in a large sample (n = 93) of healthy young men. Using diffusion tensor imaging, we measured the distribution of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity along the uncinate fascicle bilaterally. We found no differences in either measure between participants high and low in physical aggressiveness, or between those high and low in trait anger. Our results therefore argue against a direct relationship between structural OFC-amygdala connectivity and normal-range trait aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2090953039,"Within innate immune signaling pathways, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) fulfill key roles downstream of multiple Toll-like receptors and the interleukin-1 receptor. Although human IRAK4 deficiency was shown to lead to severe immunodeficiency in response to pyogenic bacterial infection during childhood, little is known about the role of human IRAK2. We here identified a non-synonymous IRAK2 variant, rs35060588 (coding R214G), as hypofunctional in terms of NF-κB signaling and Toll-like receptor-mediated cytokine induction. This was due to reduced ubiquitination of TRAF6, a key step in signal transduction. IRAK2 rs35060588 occurs in 3-9% of individuals in different ethnic groups, and our studies suggested a genetic association of rs35060588 with colorectal cancer survival. This for the first time implicates human IRAK2 in a human disease and highlights the R214G IRAK2 variant as a potential novel and broadly applicable biomarker for disease or as a therapeutic intervention point."
https://openalex.org/W1971763771,"Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) causes neuroparalytic disease by entering the neuronal soma to block the release of neurotransmitters. However, the mechanism by which TeNT translocates its enzymatic domain (light chain) across endosomal membranes remains unclear. We found that TeNT and a truncated protein devoid of the receptor binding domain (TeNT-LHN) associated with membranes enriched in acidic phospholipids in a pH-dependent manner. Thus, in contrast to diphtheria toxin, the formation of a membrane-competent state of TeNT requires the membrane interface and is modulated by the bilayer composition. Channel formation is further enhanced by tethering of TeNT to the membrane through ganglioside co-receptors prior to acidification. Thus, TeNT channel formation can be resolved into two sequential steps: 1) interaction of the receptor binding domain (heavy chain receptor binding domain) with ganglioside co-receptors orients the translocation domain (heavy chain translocation domain) as the lumen of the endosome is acidified and 2) low pH, in conjunction with acidic lipids within the membrane drives the conformational changes in TeNT necessary for channel formation."
https://openalex.org/W2099136268,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is activated upon endoproteolytic cleavage of specific segments in the extracellular domains of the α- and γ-subunits. Cleavage is accomplished by intracellular proteases prior to membrane insertion and by surface-expressed or extracellular soluble proteases once ENaC resides at the cell surface. These cleavage events are partially regulated by intracellular signaling through an unknown allosteric mechanism. Here, using a combination of computational and experimental techniques, we show that the intracellular N terminus of γ-ENaC undergoes secondary structural transitions upon interaction with phosphoinositides. From ab initio folding simulations of the N termini in the presence and absence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), we found that PIP2 increases α-helical propensity in the N terminus of γ-ENaC. Electrophysiology and mutation experiments revealed that a highly conserved cluster of lysines in the γ-ENaC N terminus regulates accessibility of extracellular cleavage sites in γ-ENaC. We also show that conditions that decrease PIP2 or enhance ubiquitination sharply limit access of the γ-ENaC extracellular domain to proteases. Further, the efficiency of allosteric control of ENaC proteolysis is dependent on Tyr(370) in γ-ENaC. Our findings provide an allosteric mechanism for ENaC activation regulated by the N termini and sheds light on a potential general mechanism of channel and receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2030096050,"Objective To explore the correlation between maternal magnetic field (MF) exposure in daily life and embryonic development. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 149 pregnant women who were seeking induced abortion of unwanted pregnancies. Participating women were asked to wear an EMDEX Lite magnetic field meter for a 24-h period to obtain MF exposure level within 4 weeks following the abortion. Embryonic bud and sac lengths were measured through B-mode ultrasound before the surgical abortion. Embryo sections were prepared and examined for histological changes, and the apoptosis status of the deciduas was examined using the TUNEL apoptosis assay. Results Embryonic bud length was inversely associated with maternal daily MF exposure level; the association was statistically significant at the time-weighted-average and 75th percentile of MF exposure levels, with coefficients of −3.09 (P = 0.0479) and −3.07(P = 0.0228), respectively. Logistic regression for examining the risk of higher MF exposure indicated that women with her 75th percentile of daily MF measurements ≥0.82 mG had a 3.95-fold risk of having a fetus with a shorter embryonic bud length than those whose daily MF exposure were <0.82 mG. MF exposure was associated with a higher degree of apoptosis, but the association was not statistically significant. We failed to find a statistical correlation between MF exposure and embryonic sac length and histological changes in the first trimester. Conclusion Prenatal MF exposure may have an adverse effect on embryonic development."

It was also detected in plasma of patients with severe sepsis, sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and healthy volunteers. The predictive value for prognosis of severe sepsis was assessed by receiver operating curve (ROC) and Cox regression analyses.eHSPA12B was elevated in plasma of CLP mice at 6 h and peaked at 24 h after surgery. A total of 118 subjects were included in the clinical section, including 66 patients with severe sepsis, 21 patients with sepsis, 16 patients with SIRS and 15 volunteers. Plasma eHSPA12B was significantly higher in patients with severe sepsis than in patients with sepsis, SIRS and volunteers. The level of eHSPA12B was also higher in non-survivals than survivals with severe sepsis. The area under the curve (AUC) of eHSPA12B in predicting death among patients with severe sepsis was 0.782 (0.654-0.909) in ROC analysis, much higher than that of IL-6 and IL-10. Cox regression analysis showed that cardiovascular diseases, IL-6 and eHSPA12B were risk factors for mortality in patients with severe sepsis. Survival curve demonstrated a strikingly significant difference between 28-day survival rates of patients with an eHSPA12B lower or not lower than 1.466 ng/ml.Plasma eHSPA12B is elevated in both septic mice and patients. It may be a good predictor for poor outcome in patients with severe sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2024935427,"Anxiety disorders often emerge during childhood. Rodent models using classical fear conditioning have shown that different types of fear depend upon different neural structures and may emerge at different stages of development. For example, some work has suggested that contextual fear conditioning generally emerges later in development (postnatal day 23–24) than explicitly cued fear conditioning (postnatal day 15–17) in rats. This has been attributed to an inability of younger subjects to form a representation of the context due to an immature hippocampus. However, evidence that contextual fear can be observed in postnatal day 17 subjects and that cued fear conditioning continues to emerge past this age raises questions about the nature of this deficit. The current studies examine this question using both the context pre-exposure facilitation effect for immediate single-shock contextual fear conditioning and traditional cued fear conditioning using Sprague-Dawley rats. The data suggest that both cued and contextual fear conditioning are continuing to develop between PD 17 and 24, consistent with development occurring the in essential fear conditioning circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2044737197,"Background The fate of clinical research projects funded by a grant has been investigated, but there is no information on the projects which did not receive funding. The fate of these projects is not known: do they apply for and/or receive funding from other sources or are they carried out without specific funding? Purpose The aim of the study was to describe all clinical research projects submitted to a French national funding scheme (PHRC 2000) and to assess project initiation, completion and publication status taking into account whether or not they received funding. Methods This study is a retrospective cohort. The initial project characteristics were retrieved from the submission files and follow-up information was collected from the primary investigator. The percentages of projects started, completed and published were studied. Results A total of 481 projects were studied. Follow-up information was obtained for 366. Overall, 185 projects were initiated (51%); 139 of them were funded by the PHRC 2000 or other sources. The most commonly cited reason for not initiating a project was a lack of funding. Subsequently, 121 of the projects initiated were completed (65%). Accrual difficulties were the main reason cited to explain why studies were stopped prematurely or were still ongoing. Finally, 88 of the completed projects were published (73%). Amongst the completed projects, the only factor explaining publication was the statistical significance of the results. Conclusions Obtainment of funding was a determining factor for project initiation. However, once initiated, the funding did not influence completion or publication."
https://openalex.org/W1968746378,"Gene introgression and hybrid barriers have long been a major focus of studies of geographically overlapping species. Two pine species, Pinus massoniana and P. hwangshanensis, are frequently observed growing adjacent to each other, where they overlap in a narrow hybrid zone. As a consequence, these species constitute an ideal system for studying genetic introgression and reproductive barriers between naturally hybridizing, adjacently distributed species. In this study, we sampled 270 pine trees along an elevation gradient in Anhui Province, China and analyzed these samples using EST-SSR markers. The molecular data revealed that direct gene flow between the two species was fairly low, and that the majority of gene introgression was intermediated by backcrossing. On the basis of empirical observation, the on-site distribution of pines was divided into a P. massoniana zone, a hybrid zone, and a P. hwangshanensis zone. STRUCTURE analysis revealed the existence of a distinct species boundary between the two pine species. The genetic boundary of the hybrid zone, on the other hand, was indistinct owing to intensive backcrossing with parental species. Compared with P. massoniana, P. hwangshanensis was found to backcross with the hybrids more intensively, consistent with the observation that morphological and anatomical characteristics of trees in the contact zone were biased towards P. hwangshanensis. The introgression ability of amplified alleles varied across species, with some being completely blocked from interspecific introgression. Our study has provided a living example to help explain the persistence of adjacently distributed species coexisting with their interfertile hybrids."

These findings offer an explanation for the variable occupancy of the metal ion at LIMBS in αVβ3 structures in the absence of ligand and provide new insights into the mechanisms of integrin regulation. Integrins are αβ heterodimeric cell adhesion receptors that mediate divalent cation-dependent cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion during morphogenesis, as well as the maintenance of tissues and organs in adult life. 18 α- and 8 β-subunits assemble into 24 integrin receptors in mammals. Integrins regulate fundamental aspects of cell behavior, including migration, adhesion, differentiation, growth, and survival, by communicating bidirectional signals between the extracellular environment and the intracellular cytoskeleton (1.Hynes R.O. Integrins: bidirectional, allosteric signaling machines.Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6852) Google Scholar). Integrins are unusual receptors as they do not engage physiologic ligand unless activated. This property allows patrolling blood leukocytes and platelets, for example, to circulate without aggregating or interacting with the vessel walls. Inappropriate activation of integrins contributes to the pathogenesis of common diseases including heart attacks, stroke, and cancer growth and metastasis. Thus understanding how these receptors are regulated is important in promoting health and treating disease (2.Arnaout M.A. Goodman S.L. Xiong J.P. Structure and mechanics of integrin-based cell adhesion.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The integrin heterodimer comprises a head segment that sits on top of two leg segments each spanning the plasma membrane once and ending with a short cytoplasmic tail. The ligand-binding head consists of a seven-bladed β-propeller domain from the α-subunit that associates noncovalently with a GTPase-like domain, βA, from the β-subunit (3.Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Crystal structure of the extracellular segment of integrin αVβ3.Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Contacts between the cytoplasmic tails and transmembrane segments hold the integrin in an inactive state (unable to bind physiologic ligand). Binding of talin to the β-cytoplasmic tail breaks these contacts, switching the ectodomain into the active (ligand-competent) conformation, a process called “inside-out” signaling (4.Moser M. Legate K.R. Zent R. Fässler R. The tail of integrins, talin, and kindlins.Science. 2009; 324: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Ligand binding then triggers global conformational changes that propagate through the plasma membrane to the cytoplasmic tails, leading to “outside-in” signaling. Integrin-ligand interactions are regulated in a complex manner by divalent cations (5.Hu D.D. Barbas C.F. Smith J.W.

Although Mn2+ and, to a lesser extent, Mg2+ stimulate ligand binding, Ca2+ is typically inhibitory. The ligand-binding face of the βA domain is decorated by three metal ion-binding sites: a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), 4The abbreviations used are: MIDASmetal ion-dependent adhesion siteLIMBSligand-associated metal-binding siteADMIDASadjacent to MIDASFBfibrinogenMDmolecular dynamicsr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationHBSSHank's balanced saline solution. flanked on one side (facing the propeller domain of the α-subunit) by a ligand-associated metal ion-binding site (LIMBS), and on the opposite side by an Adjacent to MIDAS (ADMIDAS) (9.Xiong J.P.

A ligand aspartate completes the octahedral metal coordination of an Mg2+ (or Mn2+) at MIDAS in ligand-bound integrins.

At the ligand-binding face of βA domain, the LIMBS loop residues Arg216, Asp217, and Ala218 contact residues in the α-subunit propeller domain (Fig. 1), but a potential role of the α-subunit in regulating metal ion occupancy in the βA domain has not been explored. In this study, we carried out computational and functional studies on the two β3 integrins αVβ3 and αIIbβ3. Our studies reveal an important role of the α-subunit in regulating metal ion stability at LIMBS in β3 integrins. The significance of this finding is discussed. The crystal structures of the ectodomains of αIIbβ3 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 3fcs) (12.Zhu J. Luo B.H. Xiao T. Zhang C. Nishida N. Springer T.A.

In αIIbβ3, LIMBS (also known as SymBS, synergistic metal-binding site), MIDAS, and ADMIDAS were occupied by Ca2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ respectively. Because only LIMBS was metal-occupied (by Ca2+) in unliganded αVβ3 structure, Mg2+ and Ca2+ were respectively placed at MIDAS and ADMIDAS such that their initial distances (i.e. before minimization) from all the proximal oxygen atoms were between 2.4 and 4 Å. Mutations were made to the native structures using the software Swiss-Pdb Viewer 4.1.0 (14.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL and the Swiss-PdbViewer: an environment for comparative protein modeling.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9561) Google Scholar). All non-protein atoms were removed from αIIbβ3 and αVβ3 structures, leaving α- and β-subunits with nearly 24,000 atoms for each, including hydrogens. Proteins were solvated in water boxes of sizes 168 × 169 × 207 Å (for αVβ3) and 180 × 144 × 226 Å (for αIIbβ3), adding ∼183,000 and 185,000 water molecules to αVβ3 and αIIbβ3, respectively, and ionized with 150 mm KCl. To investigate the effects of Phe191 in αIIb and Trp179 in αV on coordinating divalent cations at LIMBS, six distinct combinations of cation type and mutation for αIIbβ3 and four for αVβ3 were tested. To investigate the effects of each cation arrangement, the αIIbβ3 and αVβ3 structures were equilibrated with LIMBS-MIDAS-ADMIDAS occupancies of Ca2+-Mg2+-Ca2+ and Mn2+-Mn2+-Mn2+. MD simulations of the integrin ectodomain were performed with NAMD cvs_20130828 software package (15.Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L.

The crystal structures of the ligand-free forms of αIIbβ3 and of αVβ3 ectodomains were used without modification, except for the manual placement of metal ions at LIMBS and ADMIDAS in αVβ3 and the removal of the sugar and water molecules before solvation. All simulations were carried out at the computing facilities of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three directions. Afterward, the entire system was minimized for 20,000 steps followed by 20 or 40 ns of equilibration. A time step of 2 fs was used in all simulations. The temperature and pressure of the systems were held constant at 1 atmosphere and 310 K respectively, using the isothermal-isobaric ensemble with the Langevin piston and Hoover method, as successfully used for modeling integrins (20.Mehrbod M.

We performed 20 or 40 ns of MD simulation for each run, and the trajectories were used for all analyses. The cutoff distance for non-bonded interactions was 1.2 nm, and the particle mesh Ewald method was used for electrostatic force calculations (15.Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J.

All B-factors were set at zero. The hydrogen atom bond length was constrained using the SHAKE algorithm (23.Kräutler V. van Gunsteren W.F. Hünenberger P.H. A fast SHAKE algorithm to solve distance constraint equations for small molecules in molecular dynamics simulations.J. Comput. Chem. 2001; 22: 501-508Crossref Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Two parameters, root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values of the LIMBS metal ion and the energy of interaction of the metal ion with the LIMBS pocket, were used to evaluate stability of the metal ion at LIMBS. The r.m.s.d. of a single atom is a measure of its distance at each time step from the initial position of the ion. Hence, higher r.m.s.d. values represent fluctuations with larger amplitudes and less stable ion pocket bonds. Higher interaction energies reflect higher bond stability between the ion and LIMBS or between the α-subunit and the LIMBS loop comprising residues Arg216, Asp217, and Ala218. To let systems equilibrate for a considerable time span before starting to take samples for r.m.s.d. measurements, r.m.s.d. values for the ion were averaged over time steps between t = 16–20 ns for all simulations (n = 40). Energies of interaction between the divalent ion and the LIMBS pocket were estimated using Langevin dynamics. As this energy of interaction did not show significant fluctuations throughout the simulations, values for energy were averaged over t = 0–20 ns (n = 200). Restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA), Invitrogen Life Technologies, or Fisher Scientific. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies. The non-inhibitory monoclonal antibody (mAb) AP3 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) detects the β3 subunit in all conformations. The heterodimer-specific mouse mAbs CD41P2 to αIIbβ3 and LM609 to αVβ3 were from Millipore (Danvers, MA). The function-blocking anti-β1 mAb P5D2 was from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Mouse mAb AP5 detects the N-terminal sequence in the PSI domain only in high affinity/ligand-bound states. The Fab fragment of AP5 was prepared by papain digestion followed by anion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. The allophycocyanin-labeled goat anti-mouse Fc-specific IgG antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA).

Wild-type ligands FN10 and FB and mAbs AP5 (Fab) and AP3 (IgG) were labeled respectively with N-hydroxy succinimidyl esters of Fluor 488 (Alexa Fluor 488) or Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Excess dye was removed using Centri-Spin size-exclusion microcentrifuge columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ).

To assess β3 integrin expression levels, 6 × 105 cells in 100 μl of HBSS+0.5% BSA were incubated with CD41-P2 (anti-αIIbβ3) mAb or LM609 (anti-αVβ3) mAb at 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C followed by one wash and then addition of allophycocyanin-labeled anti-mouse Fc-specific IgG (10 μg/ml) for 20 min on ice. Samples were again washed once in HBSS and then fixed. Other cells were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647-labeled AP3 (anti-β3) (at 10 μg/ml; 30 min; 4 °C), washed once in HBSS, and then fixed. 20,000 cells were analyzed for each sample using a FACSCalibur or LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Binding of CD41-P2, LM609, AP3, and AP5 to β3 integrin-expressing HEK293T was expressed as mean fluorescence intensity, as determined using the FlowJo software (BD Biosciences). Cell binding of AP5 was normalized by dividing its mean fluorescence intensity by the mean fluorescence intensity for CD41-P2 and multiplying by 100. For ligand binding experiments, 1 mm CaCl2/1 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm MnCl2 was added to 6 × 105 β3 integrin-expressing HEK293T cells in 100 μl of HBSS buffer containing 0.5% BSA and incubated in the presence of a saturating amount of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled FB (160 μg/ml) or Alexa Fluor 488-labeled wild-type FN10 (12.6 μg/ml) for 30 min at 25 °C. To block any potential interaction of FN10 with endogenous β1 integrins in HEK293T, αIIbβ3-expressing HEK293T cells were preincubated with the function-blocking anti-β1 mAb P5D2 before adding Alexa Fluor 488-labeled FN10. Saturating amounts of each ligand were derived from dose-response curves, where labeled ligand was added in increasing concentrations to HEK293T cells expressing constitutively active β3 integrins in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2. Integrin-ligand interactions in the presence of varying concentrations of Mn2+ were measured by adding increasing amounts of MnCl2 to a mixture of β3 integrin-expressing cells and saturating amounts of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled ligand. Treated cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-labeled AP3 (10 μg/ml; 30 min; 4 °C) followed by washing once in HBSS containing the corresponding concentration of Mn2+. Cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry. Binding of soluble ligand to β3 integrin-expressing cells was normalized by dividing mean fluorescence intensity by that for Alexa Fluor 647-labeled AP3 and multiplying by 100. Mean and S.D. values from three independent experiments were calculated and compared using Student's t test. Non-linear curve fittings of the dose-response curves were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Measurements of the energy of interaction of αV and αIIb subunits with the α-subunit-facing LIMBS loop residues Arg216-Asp217-Ala218 revealed a stronger (2–3-fold) interaction of αV with the LIMBS loop when compared with αIIb. This difference was first detected at 8 ns of simulations and maintained through 40 ns (Fig. 2A). MD simulations after a few nanoseconds of equilibration showed that Ca2+ coordination at LIMBS in αIIbβ3 comprised six “primary” oxygens (i.e. the two carboxyl oxygens of Asp158 and Asp217, one carboxyl oxygen of Glu220, and the carbonyl oxygen of Pro219) (Fig. 2B), which hold a mean distance of 2.2–2.3 Å from the encapsulated cation for the entire simulation, along with two “secondary” oxygens (i.e. the carbonyl oxygens of Asp217 and Ala218), whose mean distance from the cation was no more than 4.5 Å over the whole trajectory. The primary oxygens remained in close contact with the Ca2+ at LIMBS, forming highly stable bonds with a mean length of 2.2–2.3 Å and fluctuation amplitude below 0.5 Å. The primary coordinating oxygens formed an octahedral arrangement, with a planar surface formed by OD2 of Asp158, OE1 of Glu220, OD1 of Asp217, and the carbonyl oxygen of Pro219, with OD1 of Asp158 and OD2 of Asp217 at the top and bottom of the plane, respectively (Fig. 2B), restricting cation fluctuations. Replacing Ca2+ with Mn2+ in LIMBS, MIDAS, and ADMIDAS of αIIbβ3 increased the energy of interaction of Mn2+ with LIMBS by 5–8% and had a small but significant effect on r.m.s.d.

Open table in a new tab In contrast, the LIMBS pocket is distorted toward a planar shape in αVβ3 (Fig. 2C), the result of the stronger interaction that pulled the LIMBS loop toward αV, changing metal ion coordination at this site. MD simulations showed that Ca2+ at LIMBS is coordinated by six primary oxygens (the two carboxyl oxygens of Asp158 and Asp217, the carbonyl oxygen of Pro219, and the carboxyl oxygen of Asn215), but only one secondary coordinating oxygen, the carbonyl oxygen from Asp217 (Fig. 2C). The carboxyl oxygens of Asp158 and Asp217 as well as the carbonyl oxygen of Pro219 all form one planar surface that surrounds the cation, with only the side chain oxygen of Asn215 interacting with the cation at the bottom of the plane (Fig. 2C). These changes made Ca2+ at LIMBS significantly less stable in αVβ3 when compared with αIIbβ3, as reflected by the significantly higher r.m.s.d. and lower energy of interaction of the metal with LIMBS (Table 1). Replacing Ca2+ with Mn2+ in LIMBS, MIDAS, and ADMIDAS of αVβ3 had minimal effects on r.m.s.d. or on the energy of interaction of Mn2+ with LIMBS (Table 1). In αVβ3, all three LIMBS loop residues were involved in more extensive interactions with αV: Arg216 side chain was engaged in strong ionic bonds with Glu121 and Glu123, and its carbonyl oxygen occasionally H-bonded the side chain of Tyr178 (H-bond probability 0.5%). Arg216 also formed van der Waals contacts with Phe154 and with the indole group of Trp179 (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, the main and side chains of Asp217 formed van der Waals contacts with the indole group of Trp179, and the side chain of Ala218 contacted the carboxyl oxygen of Asp219 in αV. These interactions stretched the LIMBS loop toward αV, distorting LIMBS. In contrast, interaction of αIIb with LIMBS loop residues Arg216-Asp217-Ala218 was primarily limited to Arg216. The side chain of Arg216 formed intermittent H-bonds with the hydroxyl group of Tyr190 (H-bond probability 5.0%), and its carbonyl oxygen contacted the side chain of Tyr190 (Fig. 3C). Arg216 side chain also formed occasional ionic interactions with Glu123 (Fig. 3D), but made no contacts with Phe191. Additionally, Asp232 made intermittent van der Waals contacts with the side chain of Ala218. Of the α-subunit residues contacting the LIMBS loop residues Arg216-Asp217-Ala218, the side chains of Phe191 in αIIb and Trp179 in αV are superimposable (Fig. 1). We evaluated the impact of interchanging these two residues on stability of the metal ion at LIMBS in the two β3 integrins. As an internal control, we measured the effects of destabilizing the metal ion at LIMBS through the D158/N substitution (which removes one of the main coordinating oxygens from the metal ion). MD simulations showed that implementing the D158/N mutation in αIIbβ3 yielded a significant increase in r.m.s.d. (∼2-fold) and a reduction in the energy of interaction (Table 1), both reflecting destabilization of the metal ion at LIMBS. Implementing the F191/W substitution in αIIb significantly increased the energy of interaction of the LIMBS loop with the bulkier Trp191 in αIIbF/W when compared with Phe191 in wild-type αIIb (Fig. 4A). Snapshot of the structure at t = 20 ns showed that the side chain of Arg216 of β3 releases its interaction with Tyr190 and forms van der Waals contacts with the indole group of Trp191 in αIIbF/W (compare Fig. 4B with Fig. 3C), pulling the LIMBS loop region t"
