https://openalex.org/W2026690931,"Although the proteins that read the gene regulatory code, transcription factors (TFs), have been largely identified, it is not well known which sequences TFs can recognize. We have analyzed the sequence-specific binding of human TFs using high-throughput SELEX and ChIP sequencing. A total of 830 binding profiles were obtained, describing 239 distinctly different binding specificities. The models represent the majority of human TFs, approximately doubling the coverage compared to existing systematic studies. Our results reveal additional specificity determinants for a large number of factors for which a partial specificity was known, including a commonly observed A- or T-rich stretch that flanks the core motifs. Global analysis of the data revealed that homodimer orientation and spacing preferences, and base-stacking interactions, have a larger role in TF-DNA binding than previously appreciated. We further describe a binding model incorporating these features that is required to understand binding of TFs to DNA."

The intrinsic porosity of these materials has made them of interest for ultrahigh permeability gas separation membranes. However, while the polymers show good gas permeability, they have only moderate gas selectivity. Carta et al. (p. 303 ; see the Perspective by Guiver and Lee ) hypothesized that if they could replace the dioxin-like rings in their polymers with stiffer bridged bicyclic rings, they could improve the membrane properties of the polymer. By exploiting reactions connected to the formation of Tröger's base to form the multiple covalent bonds needed to make the bicyclic rings, the resulting polymers showed significantly improved selectivity and permeability."

Recent efforts have characterized the diversity of this host-associated community, but it remains unclear which microorganisms are active and what perturbations influence this activity. Here, we combine flow cytometry, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and metatranscriptomics to demonstrate that the gut contains a distinctive set of active microorganisms, primarily Firmicutes. Short-term exposure to a panel of xenobiotics significantly affected the physiology, structure, and gene expression of this active gut microbiome. Xenobiotic-responsive genes were found across multiple bacterial phyla, encoding antibiotic resistance, drug metabolism, and stress response pathways. These results demonstrate the power of moving beyond surveys of microbial diversity to better understand metabolic activity, highlight the unintended consequences of xenobiotics, and suggest that attempts at personalized medicine should consider interindividual variations in the active human gut microbiome.PaperClip/cms/asset/10020365-199e-44e2-893e-38d49fd71730/mmc2.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 6.07 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W1982754708,"According to current models, once the cell has reached terminal differentiation, the enhancer repertoire is completely established and maintained by cooperatively acting lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs). TFs activated by extracellular stimuli operate within this predetermined repertoire, landing close to where master regulators are constitutively bound. Here, we describe latent enhancers, defined as regions of the genome that in terminally differentiated cells are unbound by TFs and lack the histone marks characteristic of enhancers but acquire these features in response to stimulation. Macrophage stimulation caused sequential binding of stimulus-activated and lineage-determining TFs to these regions, enabling deposition of enhancer marks. Once unveiled, many of these enhancers did not return to a latent state when stimulation ceased; instead, they persisted and mediated a faster and stronger response upon restimulation. We suggest that stimulus-specific expansion of the cis-regulatory repertoire provides an epigenomic memory of the exposure to environmental agents."
https://openalex.org/W2136994247,"Autophagy is a stress response protecting cells from unfavorable conditions, such as nutrient starvation. The class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, Vps34, forms multiple complexes and regulates both intracellular vesicle trafficking and autophagy induction. Here, we show that AMPK plays a key role in regulating different Vps34 complexes. AMPK inhibits the nonautophagy Vps34 complex by phosphorylating T163/S165 in Vps34 and therefore suppresses overall PI(3)P production and protects cells from starvation. In parallel, AMPK activates the proautophagy Vps34 complex by phosphorylating S91/S94 in Beclin1 to induce autophagy. Atg14L, an autophagy-essential gene present only in the proautophagy Vps34 complex, inhibits Vps34 phosphorylation but increases Beclin1 phosphorylation by AMPK. As such, Atg14L dictates the differential regulation (either inhibition or activation) of different Vps34 complexes in response to glucose starvation. Our study reveals an intricate molecular regulation of Vps34 complexes by AMPK in nutrient stress response and autophagy."

Here, we mapped chromatin genome-wide in a large and diverse collection of human tissues and stem cells. The maps yield unprecedented annotations of functional genomic elements and their regulation across developmental stages, lineages, and cellular environments. They also reveal global features of the epigenome, related to nuclear architecture, that also vary across cellular phenotypes. Specifically, developmental specification is accompanied by progressive chromatin restriction as the default state transitions from dynamic remodeling to generalized compaction. Exposure to serum in vitro triggers a distinct transition that involves de novo establishment of domains with features of constitutive heterochromatin. We describe how these global chromatin state transitions relate to chromosome and nuclear architecture, and discuss their implications for lineage fidelity, cellular senescence, and reprogramming.

A resource of chromatin state maps for phenotypically diverse human tissues Annotation of regulatory elements across developmental stages and environments Developmental specification is accompanied by progressive chromatin restriction Chromatin architecture changes in cultured cells have implications for reprogramming Since the initial sequencing of the human genome a decade ago, our understanding of the primary DNA sequence has advanced profoundly (Lander, 2011Lander E.S. Initial impact of the sequencing of the human genome.Nature. 2011; 470: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Sequence signals and multispecies conservation have enabled precise annotation of protein coding genes and the identification of increasing numbers of noncoding RNAs, regulatory elements, and motifs. Systematic genotyping studies have identified common variants associated with complex diseases and recurrent mutations that confer growth advantage in cancer. However, entirely sequence-directed investigations cannot address the fundamental question of how one genome can give rise to a large and phenotypically diverse collection of cells and tissues during embryonic development. Nor can they explain how environmental conditions further shape these phenotypes and affect disease risks (Feinberg, 2007Feinberg A.P. Phenotypic plasticity and the epigenetics of human disease.Nature. 2007; 447: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). An understanding of the regulatory networks and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie context-specific gene expression programs and cellular phenotypes remains a critical scientific goal with broad implications for human health. Genomic DNA is organized into chromatin, which adopts characteristic configurations when DNA interacts with transcription factors (TFs), RNA polymerase, or other regulators (Margueron and Reinberg, 2010Margueron R. Reinberg D. Chromatin structure and the inheritance of epigenetic information.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Charting these configurations with genome-wide maps of histone modifications (“chromatin state maps”) thus represents an effective means for identifying functional DNA elements and assessing their activities in a given cell population (Zhou et al., 2011Zhou V.W. Goren A. Bernstein B.E. Charting histone modifications and the functional organization of mammalian genomes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Signature patterns of “active” chromatin marks demarcate poised or active promoters, transcribed regions, and candidate enhancers. Other modifications reveal distinct modes of chromatin repression, such as those mediated by Polycomb regulators or heterochromatin proteins. Recent studies have applied chromatin profiling to characterize enhancer dynamics and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in differentiation, cellular reprogramming, and disease processes (Ernst et al., 2011Ernst J. Kheradpour P. Mikkelsen T.S. Shoresh N. Ward L.D. Epstein C.B. Zhang X. Wang L. Issner R. Coyne M. et al.Mapping and analysis of chromatin state dynamics in nine human cell types.Nature. 2011; 473: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar; Hawkins et al., 2010bHawkins R.D.

However, the overwhelming focus of such studies on in vitro cells has constrained our ability to detect and characterize regulatory elements in the human genome and to understand how global features of the epigenome impact cellular phenotypes across different lineages, developmental stages, and environmental conditions. Here, we present a resource of over 300 chromatin state maps for a phenotypically diverse collection of human tissues, blood lineages, and stem cells, produced by the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium (Bernstein et al., 2010Bernstein B.E. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Costello J.F. Ren B. Milosavljevic A. Meissner A. Kellis M. Marra M.A. Beaudet A.L. Ecker J.R. et al.The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 1045-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). The maps depict the distributions of major histone modifications and provide a systematic view of the dynamic chromatin landscapes of in vivo tissues. We use the maps to identify and characterize ∼400,000 cell-type-specific distal regulatory elements, many of which can be tied to upstream TFs or signaling pathways and whose activity patterns provide a precise fingerprint of cell phenotype. We also describe global chromatin state transitions that distinguish groups of cells representative of different developmental stages or environmental conditions and investigate their implications for lineage fidelity, nuclear architecture, cellular senescence, and reprogramming. This extensive catalog of in vivo chromatin states thus presents a unique resource of genomic annotations for biomedical research along with novel epigenetic features that vary markedly across cellular states. We acquired chromatin state maps for 29 tissues and cell types spanning a wide range of developmental stages, lineages, and derivations (Figure 1A). We used chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to map histone modifications associated with diverse regulatory and epigenetic functions, including H3K4me1 (H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation), H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K9ac (lysine 9 acetylation), and H3K27ac. Procedures were optimized for different tissue preparations and to accommodate for limiting samples (Experimental Procedures). We also incorporated data sets for in vitro cultured cells into our analysis (Ernst et al., 2011Ernst J. Kheradpour P. Mikkelsen T.S. Shoresh N. Ward L.D. Epstein C.B. Zhang X. Wang L. Issner R. Coyne M. et al.Mapping and analysis of chromatin state dynamics in nine human cell types.Nature. 2011; 473: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). The resource contains over 300 chromatin state maps that significantly expand coverage of the human epigenome (Table S1 available online). All data sets were publically released upon verification at www.roadmapepigenomics.org and are also available at http://www.broadinstitute.org/pubs/epigenomicsresource. We applied automated methods to characterize the chromatin landscapes and relate them to underlying cellular phenotypes. First, we clustered the profiles based on pair-wise correlations (Figure 1B). The modifications organize into separate clusters, reflecting their associations to distinct genomic features. Modifications associated with promoter (H3K4me3, H3K9ac), transcript (H3K36me3), and distal element (H3K4me1, H3K27ac) activity correlate positively with one another but show varying degrees of exclusivity with repressive marks (H3K27me3, H3K9me3). Next, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to measure and visualize differences between cell types. Treating each histone modification separately, we computed weighted combinations of enrichment levels in genomic windows (PC1, PC2, and PC3) that capture a large proportion of the variation between cell types (Figure S1; Experimental Procedures). The PCA shows a striking capacity to segregate cells and tissues based on fundamental characteristics as seen in 3D projections of PC coordinates (Figure 1C). This is particularly evident for modifications associated with regulatory activity (H3K4me1, H3K27ac), which distinguish five groups of phenotypically related tissue and cell types (see Patterns and Determinants of Regulatory Activity and Potential in the Human Genome below). PC projections for several modifications are notable for stark translations of certain cellular groups along PC1, indicative of major differences in chromatin state. In particular, the marked separation of pluripotent stem cells from other cell and tissue types evident in the H3K27me3 and H3K4me1 projections portends a global reorganization that accompanies developmental specification (see Developmental Specification Is Associated with Progressive Chromatin Restriction). Furthermore, a clear separation of cultured cells in the H3K9me3 projection signifies a distinct reorganization induced by in vitro culture (see Culture Environments Trigger Macroscale Chromatin State Changes). The PCA also provides a general tool for comparing newly characterized cell types against representative chromatin state maps in this resource. Enhancers and other distal regulatory elements are critical for context-specific gene regulation but have yet to be systematically charted in primary human cells and tissues. Such elements are associated with characteristic chromatin marks, including H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, which facilitate their identification (Bulger and Groudine, 2011Bulger M. Groudine M. Functional and mechanistic diversity of distal transcription enhancers.Cell. 2011; 144: 327-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar; Hawkins et al., 2010bHawkins R.D. Hon G.C. Ren B. Next-generation genomics: an integrative approach.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 476-486PubMed Google Scholar). We annotated candidate regulatory elements by calling H3K4me1 peaks in 30 cell types. After filtering out peaks that overlap a transcription start site (TSS), we identified an average of ∼94,000 distal sites per cell type. Integrating all sites marked by H3K4me1 in at least two cell types reveals ∼377,000 putative distal regulatory elements, with a median size of 1.2 kb. The elements are highly tissue-specific, with 56% marked in three or fewer cell types. Clustering on H3K4me1 patterns revealed 23 major clusters of elements with related cell-type specificities (Figure 2A). The biological relevance of individual clusters is supported by the identities of proximal genes, which are expressed at higher levels in the corresponding cell types and enriched for related functional annotations (Table S2; Experimental Procedures). Roughly half of all H3K4me1 sites also carry H3K27ac in at least a subset of cell types and thus represent candidate enhancers (Figure 2B). Notably, nearly half of the candidate enhancers are specific to in vivo tissues, blood lineages, or brain sections. To identify underlying sequence determinants, we scanned the candidate enhancers for TF consensus motifs. We identified significantly enriched motifs for each of the 23 clusters of commonly regulated elements (Figure 2A, Table S3; Experimental Procedures). The corresponding motif instances tend to be highly conserved and to coincide with dips in the chromatin profiles indicative of TF interactions (He et al., 2010He H.H. Meyer C.A. Shin H. Bailey S.T. Wei G. Wang Q. Zhang Y. Xu K. Ni M. Lupien M. et al.Nucleosome dynamics define transcriptional enhancers.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). A sampling of predicted TF-motif interactions were also verified using TF-binding data (Figure S2; ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012ENCODE Project ConsortiumAn integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome.Nature. 2012; 489: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11031) Google Scholar). The data implicate known and potentially novel roles for specific TFs as regulators of cell-type-specific distal elements and gene expression programs. To highlight one example, brain- and neural-stem-cell-specific elements are enriched for NF1, RFX, SOX2, SOX10, and E-box motifs (Figure 2A; clusters 18–20). In several cases, a given TF motif is enriched in multiple unrelated clusters and thus implicated under distinct cellular contexts. A case in point is SOX2, a multifunctional TF with roles in pluripotent stem cells and neural lineages. The SOX2 motif is enriched in pluripotent- (cluster 9) and neural-specific (cluster 20) distal elements, suggesting that specificity among these clusters may involve proximal sequence signals. Indeed, 25% of SOX2 motifs in “pluripotent” elements coincide with OCT4 motifs, whereas a majority of SOX2 motifs in “neural” elements instead coincide with PAX2 motifs. Further complexity is evident at the level of enhancer usage as many loci contain multiple elements whose activity patterns vary even between cell types in which nearby genes are active (Figure 2C). These and other examples suggest a prominent role for combinatorial TF activities and complex distal element patterning in directing gene expression programs in human cells (Bulger and Groudine, 2011Bulger M. Groudine M. Functional and mechanistic diversity of distal transcription enhancers.Cell. 2011; 144: 327-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In addition to lineage-specific TFs, the motif enrichments implicate signaling and environmental response pathways activated in specific contexts. Clusters of distal elements broadly associated with primary cells cultured in serum are enriched for motifs recognized by AP-1 (clusters 12–14), a classical integrator of extrinsic growth stimuli and environmental stress (Angel and Karin, 1991Angel P. Karin M. The role of Jun, Fos and the AP-1 complex in cell-proliferation and transformation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3262) Google Scholar). A related cluster is also enriched for the p53 motif (cluster 13), consistent with documented activation of p53 senescence programs in these primary cell models (Rheinwald et al., 2002Rheinwald J.G. Hahn W.C. Ramsey M.R. Wu J.Y. Guo Z. Tsao H. De Luca M. Catricalà C. O’Toole K.M. A two-stage, p16(INK4A)- and p53-dependent keratinocyte senescence mechanism that limits replicative potential independent of telomere status.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5157-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The large number and diverse activity patterns of distal elements prompted us to examine their global distributions. We calculated the proportion of the genome that lies within 50 kb of an H3K4me1+ element in each cell type. This proportion remains relatively constant at ∼50% across the differentiated tissues and cell types. However, H3K4me1 sites are more prevalent and dispersed in pluripotent cells, such that a full 85% of the genome is within 50 kb of a site (Figure 2D). This pattern does not appear to reflect increased gene activity as the proportion of genome marked by H3K36me3 in pluripotent cells (∼17%) is similar to the average for differentiated cells (∼23%). Moreover, the proportion of elements with concomitant H3K27ac is notably lower for H3K4me1 sites in pluripotent stem cells (Figure 2B), indicating that many may represent “poised” enhancers or other sites of accessible chromatin. Thus, much of the genome in pluripotent cells appears to be coincident or proximal to accessible chromatin. The dramatically reduced prevalence of accessible chromatin in differentiated cells prompted us to test for concomitant changes in repressive chromatin. We focused on marks associated with Polycomb-repression (H3K27me3) and constitutive heterochromatin (H3K9me3). Both modifications contribute to stable gene repression through interactions with protein complexes involved in chromatin compaction (Margueron and Reinberg, 2010Margueron R. Reinberg D. Chromatin structure and the inheritance of epigenetic information.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar; Simon and Kingston, 2009Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Mechanisms of polycomb gene silencing: knowns and unknowns.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 697-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCA statistics (Figure 1C) indicate that, like H3K4me1, global H3K27me3 patterns are distinct in pluripotent cells. Indeed, we find that the changes in H3K4me1 patterns are complemented by a profound reorganization of the H3K27me3 landscape. In embryonic (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, this surrogate of Polycomb activity is confined to peaks at “bivalent” GC-rich promoters that also carry H3K4me3. This punctate pattern contrasts with a much broader distribution of H3K27me3 in differentiated cells and tissues (Figure 3A). We used a customized approach to quantify coverage in each cell type (Figures 3B and S3; Experimental Procedures). This confirmed that H3K27me3 affects a considerably larger proportion of genome in differentiated cells (∼40%) than pluripotent cells (∼8%). This dramatic shift is supported by western blots showing that acid-extracted histones from differentiated cells have higher H3K27me3 levels than similar extracts from ES cells (Figure S3).Figure S3Global Distributions of H3K27me3, H2A.Z and H3K4me1, Related to Figures 3 and 4Show full caption(A) Top: cumulative H3K27me3 signal distributions are plotted for background (transcribed regions), foreground (repressed high CpG content promoters), and intergenic regions in ES cells and CD34+ progenitors.

Mouse brain tissues (red) show the strongest relative confinement of H3K4me1 peaks to gene bodies, consistent with patterns observed in human brain (Figures 4B and 4C). The focal distribution of H3K27me3 in pluripotent cells could reflect reduced Polycomb activity. However, EZH2 and other Polycomb factors are highly expressed in ES cells. This led us to consider an alternate model in which the highly dynamic chromatin in pluripotent cells (Meshorer et al., 2006Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Hyperdynamic plasticity of chromatin proteins in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) is refractory to the compaction associated with Polycomb repression. To explore this, we mapped H2A.Z, a histone variant associated with nucleosome exchange and remodeling (Talbert and Henikoff, 2010Talbert P.B. Henikoff S. Histone variants—ancient wrap artists of the epigenome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), in representative cell types (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3). Consistent with prior studies (Hardy et al., 2009Hardy S. Jacques P.E. Gévry N. Forest A. Fortin M.E. Laflamme L. Gaudreau L. Robert F. The euchromatic and heterochromatic landscapes are shaped by antagonizing effects of transcription on H2A.Z deposition.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000687Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), H2A.Z is depleted within elongating transcripts in all cell types examined. However, the global H2A.Z distribution diverges markedly between pluripotent and differentiated cells. In ES and iPS cells, the variant marks promoters and distal elements, but is also distributed throughout intergenic regions. In differentiated cells, H2A.Z is instead confined to promoters and distal elements. The broad H2A.Z distribution suggests that chromatin exchange is prevalent throughout the genome in embryonic cells. Although H2A.Z may be compatible with punctate Polycomb sites in ES cells (Creyghton et al., 2008Creyghton M.P. Markoulaki S. Levine S.S. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Sha K. Young R.A. Jaenisch R. Boyer L.A. H2AZ is enriched at polycomb complex target genes in ES cells and is necessary for lineage commitment.Cell. 2008; 135: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), dynamic chromatin is likely incompatible with the stable interactions required for Polycomb spreading and compaction (Simon and Kingston, 2009Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Mechanisms of polycomb gene silencing: knowns and unknowns.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 697-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, pervasive exchange may underlie the constrained H3K27me3 distribution and the uniquely accessible chromatin landscape in pluripotent cells. To gain insight into the timing of the developmental transition, we profiled H3K27me3 in a series of cell populations representing successive stages of specification. These include (1) embryoid bodies (EBs) isolated from differentiating ES cells at day 4, (2) EBs isolated at day 9, (3) neural progenitors derived from ES cells through a 3 week differentiation procedure, and (4) neurons differentiated from these progenitors. We found that ES cell differentiation is accompanied by progressive enrichment of H3K27me3 across the genome, with subtle but significant changes in EBs, and profound alterations in neural progenitors and neurons (Figures 3E and 3F). The latter populations exhibit a diffuse H3K27me3 distribution akin to other differentiated cell types. This suggests that reorganization of the chromatin landscape begins early in development and is recapitulated by in vitro differentiation of ES cells. We next examined the locations and characteristics of genomic loci that gain H3K27me3 in the differentiated populations. We focused on a set of ∼3,000 loci (100 kb size) with variable activity across the phenotypic groups. We scored each locus for (1) distal element H3K4me1 levels, (2) promoter H3K4me3 levels, (3) transcript H3K36me3 levels, and (4) overall H3K27me3 levels within each phenotypic group, and clustered them accordingly (Figure 4A; Experimental Procedures). The resulting cluster diagram conveys the variable patterning of these loci. Promoter, transcript, and distal element activities are highly concordant within a given locus but correlate negatively with the extent of H3K27me3 coverage. These patterns provide a systematic view of how Polycomb-repressed chromatin is engaged in specific lineages to maintain silencing of gene loci with functions in alternate lineages. Chromatin restriction can also proceed beyond this initial developmental reorganization, under certain contexts. In particular, the brain sections exhibit uniquely high H3K27me3 coverage over intergenic regions, relative to annotated genes (Figure 4B). Expansion of the Polycomb-repressed state is accompanied by a dramatic restriction of accessible chromatin, such that ∼70% of H3K4me1 sites in brain reside within transcriptional units (Figures 4B and 4C). To test the generality of this finding, we examined H3K4me1 profiles for assorted mouse tissues (Shen et al., 2012Shen Y. Yue F. McCleary D.F. Ye Z. Edsall L. Kuan S. Wagner U. Dixon J. Lee L. Lobanenkov V.V. Ren B. A map of the cis-regulatory sequences in the mouse genome.Nature. 2012; 488: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Out of 19 cell and tissue types examined, we found that cerebellum and cortex have the highest proportions of H3K4me1 sites within genic regions (Figure S3). The brain sections are unique among tissues in the resource in that they comprise specialized, terminally differentiated cell types—primarily neurons and glial cells. We reasoned that the restrictive chromatin environment in these cells might obstruct access to intergenic sequences and thus favor recognition of functional elements within introns. In support of this possibility, we find that the genes with a high density of conserved noncoding sequences in their introns are expressed at higher levels in brain and enriched for functional annotations related to neuronal physiology (Figure 4D; Experimental Procedures). In summary, our data suggest that developmental specification is accompanied by a striking transition from a permissive chromatin state with widespread remodeling to a restrictive state with pervasive Polycomb repression. Chromatin restriction may also proceed significantly further in certain specialized cells, with brain sections in particular exhibiting severe sequestration of intergenic sequences and evidence for preferential utilization of regulatory elements within introns. The coarse partitioning of the genome between loci of coordinated gene regulatory activity and large Polycomb-repressed regions prompted us to investigate macroscale patterns of histone modification. Focusing on ∼3,000 1 Mb intervals, we quantified relative coverage by each modification and clustered the intervals accordingly. We found that most intervals are dominated by a single coherent chromatin state, allowing us to segregate them into four groups: (1) “active” loci with high H3K36me3 and H3K4me1 coverage, (2) “Polycomb-repressed” loci with high H3K27me3, (3) Heterochromatic loci with high H3K9me3, and (4) “Null” loci devoid of histone modification (Figure 5). Several lines of evidence suggest that the macroscale chromatin patterns reflect chromosomal and nuclear architecture. The chromatin states align with chromosome banding patterns, with active (1) and inactive states (2–4), respectively, enriched in light and dark bands. All three inactive states are also enriched for contacts with the nuclear lamina (Guelen et al., 2008Guelen L. Pagie L. Brasset E. Meuleman W. Faza M.B. Talhout W. Eussen"

By tracking dendritic cell movements in the ears of mice, Weber et al. (p. 328 ) were able to provide both. Endogenous gradients of the chemokine CCL21 were observed in ear tissue and, at distances of up 90 µm, dendritic cells were able to use these gradients to migrate directionally toward lymphatic vessels. The CCL21 gradient was immobilized on heparan sulfates and disruption of the gradient inhibited dendritic cell migration."

But images often contain a lot of redundant information—effectively creating huge data files of meaningless information. While algorithms can compress the size of a file without loss of information, such processing is done after the picture has been taken. Hunt et al. (p. 310 ) used a metamaterial sensor to compress the sampled scene directly, obviating the need for postprocessing. Tuning the response of the metamaterial allowed imaging of a scene with a 40:1 compression ratio, which may mean that finding that needle in a haystack may be much easier using a metamaterial camera."
https://openalex.org/W2051301625,"The primary cilium is required for Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in vertebrates. In contrast to mutants affecting ciliary assembly, mutations in the intraflagellar transport complex A (IFT-A) paradoxically cause increased Shh signaling. We previously showed that the IFT-A complex, in addition to its canonical role in retrograde IFT, binds to the tubby-like protein, Tulp3, and recruits it to cilia. Here, we describe a conserved vertebrate G-protein-coupled receptor, Gpr161, which localizes to primary cilia in a Tulp3/IFT-A-dependent manner. Complete loss of Gpr161 in mouse causes midgestation lethality and increased Shh signaling in the neural tube, phenocopying Tulp3/IFT-A mutants. Constitutive Gpr161 activity increases cAMP levels and represses Shh signaling by determining the processing of Gli3 to its repressor form. Conversely, Shh signaling directs Gpr161 to be internalized from cilia, preventing its activity. Thus, Gpr161 defines a morphogenetic pathway coupling protein kinase A activation to Shh signaling during neural tube development."

Here, we describe a luciferase knockin mouse (p16(LUC)), which faithfully reports expression of p16(INK4a), a tumor suppressor and aging biomarker. Lifelong assessment of luminescence in p16(+/LUC) mice revealed an exponential increase with aging, which was highly variable in a cohort of contemporaneously housed, syngeneic mice. Expression of p16(INK4a) with aging did not predict cancer development, suggesting that the accumulation of senescent cells is not a principal determinant of cancer-related death. In 14 of 14 tested tumor models, expression of p16(LUC) was focally activated by early neoplastic events, enabling visualization of tumors with sensitivity exceeding other imaging modalities. Activation of p16(INK4a) was noted in the emerging neoplasm and surrounding stromal cells. This work suggests that p16(INK4a) activation is a characteristic of all emerging cancers, making the p16(LUC) allele a sensitive, unbiased reporter of neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2021548599,"Establishment of oligodendrocyte identity is crucial for subsequent events of myelination in the CNS. Here, we demonstrate that activation of ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzyme Smarca4/Brg1 at the differentiation onset is necessary and sufficient to initiate and promote oligodendrocyte lineage progression and maturation. Genome-wide multistage studies by ChIP-seq reveal that oligodendrocyte-lineage determination factor Olig2 functions as a prepatterning factor to direct Smarca4/Brg1 to oligodendrocyte-specific enhancers. Recruitment of Smarca4/Brg1 to distinct subsets of myelination regulatory genes is developmentally regulated. Functional analyses of Smarca4/Brg1 and Olig2 co-occupancy relative to chromatin epigenetic marking uncover stage-specific cis-regulatory elements that predict sets of transcriptional regulators controlling oligodendrocyte differentiation. Together, our results demonstrate that regulation of the functional specificity and activity of a Smarca4/Brg1-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex by Olig2, coupled with transcriptionally linked chromatin modifications, is critical to precisely initiate and establish the transcriptional program that promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and subsequent myelination of the CNS."

https://openalex.org/W1966086662,"Many cellular processes require large forces that are generated collectively by multiple cytoskeletal motor proteins. Understanding how motors generate force as a team is therefore fundamentally important but is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate optical trapping at single-molecule resolution inside cells to quantify force generation by motor teams driving single phagosomes. In remarkable paradox, strong kinesins fail to work collectively, whereas weak and detachment-prone dyneins team up to generate large forces that tune linearly in strength and persistence with dynein number. Based on experimental evidence, we propose that leading dyneins in a load-carrying team take short steps, whereas trailing dyneins take larger steps. Dyneins in such a team bunch close together and therefore share load better to overcome low/intermediate loads. Up against higher load, dyneins “catch bond” tenaciously to the microtubule, but kinesins detach rapidly. Dynein therefore appears uniquely adapted to work in large teams, which may explain how this motor executes bewilderingly diverse cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W2026037302,"The Scale of Plant Invasions Many studies have shown large effects of invasive species on native species diversity, but at the same time, invaders (especially plants) have rarely been implicated in the extinctions of native species. Powell et al. (p. 316 ) noted that studies showing large effects have tended to be focused on smaller spatial scales, while those showing smaller effects have usually been on broader spatial scales. For such a scale-dependent effect to occur, invasive species must alter the shape of the species-area relationship (SAR). Comparing the differences in SARs with invaded and uninvaded communities of plants in three different ecosystem types in the United States revealed smaller effects of invasive species on biodiversity at increasingly broader spatial scales. Empirical data and simulations suggested that the observed patterns result from disproportionately greater influences of invasive species on common relative to rare species that result from a combination of sampling effects and differential responses to invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2005369928,"In eukaryotic cells a molecular chaperone network associates with translating ribosomes, assisting the maturation of emerging nascent polypeptides. Hsp70 is perhaps the major eukaryotic ribosome-associated chaperone and the first reported to bind cotranslationally to nascent chains. However, little is known about the underlying principles and function of this interaction. Here, we use a sensitive and global approach to define the cotranslational substrate specificity of the yeast Hsp70 SSB. We find that SSB binds to a subset of nascent polypeptides whose intrinsic properties and slow translation rates hinder efficient cotranslational folding. The SSB-ribosome cycle and substrate recognition is modulated by its ribosome-bound cochaperone, RAC. Deletion of SSB leads to widespread aggregation of newly synthesized polypeptides. Thus, cotranslationally acting Hsp70 meets the challenge of folding the eukaryotic proteome by stabilizing its longer, more slowly translated, and aggregation-prone nascent polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2155304372,"The sequence-specific transcription factor NF-Y binds the CCAAT box, one of the sequence elements most frequently found in eukaryotic promoters. NF-Y is composed of the NF-YA and NF-YB/NF-YC subunits, the latter two hosting histone-fold domains (HFDs). The crystal structure of NF-Y bound to a 25 bp CCAAT oligonucleotide shows that the HFD dimer binds to the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, mimicking the nucleosome H2A/H2B-DNA assembly. NF-YA both binds to NF-YB/NF-YC and inserts an α helix deeply into the DNA minor groove, providing sequence-specific contacts to the CCAAT box. Structural considerations and mutational data indicate that NF-YB ubiquitination at Lys138 precedes and is equivalent to H2B Lys120 monoubiquitination, important in transcriptional activation. Thus, NF-Y is a sequence-specific transcription factor with nucleosome-like properties of nonspecific DNA binding and helps establish permissive chromatin modifications at CCAAT promoters. Our findings suggest that other HFD-containing proteins may function in similar ways."

Given that many species depend on similar resources, such events might also be expected to synchronize dynamics across species, but the complexity of multispecies communities makes it difficult to reveal potential drivers in common. Hansen et al. (p. 313 ) took advantage of the simplicity of the year-round community on the high-arctic island of Spitsbergen to test for the presence of synchrony. Population fluctuations were synchronized across the three herbivore species (Svalbard reindeer, Svalbard rock ptarmigan, and sibling vole) and the single resident predator, the arctic fox, was in lagged synchrony. The driver of these fluctuations appears to be extreme winter rain-on-snow events that reduce the availability of winter forage due to ice cover."
https://openalex.org/W2055677100,"Differentiated cells possess a remarkable genomic plasticity that can be manipulated to reverse or change developmental commitments. Here, we show that the leprosy bacterium hijacks this property to reprogram adult Schwann cells, its preferred host niche, to a stage of progenitor/stem-like cells (pSLC) of mesenchymal trait by downregulating Schwann cell lineage/differentiation-associated genes and upregulating genes mostly of mesoderm development. Reprogramming accompanies epigenetic changes and renders infected cells highly plastic, migratory, and immunomodulatory. We provide evidence that acquisition of these properties by pSLC promotes bacterial spread by two distinct mechanisms: direct differentiation to mesenchymal tissues, including skeletal and smooth muscles, and formation of granuloma-like structures and subsequent release of bacteria-laden macrophages. These findings support a model of host cell reprogramming in which a bacterial pathogen uses the plasticity of its cellular niche for promoting dissemination of infection and provide an unexpected link between cellular reprogramming and host-pathogen interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2089042385,"Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is an abundant enzyme that has been best studied as a regulator of antioxidant defense. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we report that SOD1 transmits signals from oxygen and glucose to repress respiration. The mechanism involves SOD1-mediated stabilization of two casein kinase 1-gamma (CK1γ) homologs, Yck1p and Yck2p, required for respiratory repression. SOD1 binds a C-terminal degron we identified in Yck1p/Yck2p and promotes kinase stability by catalyzing superoxide conversion to peroxide. The effects of SOD1 on CK1γ stability are also observed with mammalian SOD1 and CK1γ and in a human cell line. Therefore, in a single circuit, oxygen, glucose, and reactive oxygen can repress respiration through SOD1/CK1γ signaling. Our data therefore may provide mechanistic insight into how rapidly proliferating cells and many cancers accomplish glucose-mediated repression of respiration in favor of aerobic glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2154267426,"The sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein, is an interorganelle signaling modulator that potentially plays a role in drug-seeking behaviors. However, the brain site of action and underlying cellular mechanisms remain unidentified. We found that cocaine exposure triggers a Sig-1R-dependent upregulation of D-type K(+) current in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) that results in neuronal hypoactivity and thereby enhances behavioral cocaine response. Combining ex vivo and in vitro studies, we demonstrated that this neuroadaptation is caused by a persistent protein-protein association between Sig-1Rs and Kv1.2 channels, a phenomenon that is associated to a redistribution of both proteins from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. In conclusion, the dynamic Sig-1R-Kv1.2 complex represents a mechanism that shapes neuronal and behavioral response to cocaine. Functional consequences of Sig-1R binding to K(+) channels may have implications for other chronic diseases where maladaptive intrinsic plasticity and Sig-1Rs are engaged."

https://openalex.org/W2149670621,"Stem and/or progenitor cells often generate distinct cell types in a stereotyped birth order and over time lose competence to specify earlier-born fates by unknown mechanisms. In Drosophila, the Hunchback transcription factor acts in neural progenitors (neuroblasts) to specify early-born neurons, in part by indirectly inducing the neuronal transcription of its target genes, including the hunchback gene. We used in vivo immuno-DNA FISH and found that the hunchback gene moves to the neuroblast nuclear periphery, a repressive subnuclear compartment, precisely when competence to specify early-born fate is lost and several hours and cell divisions after termination of its transcription. hunchback movement to the lamina correlated with downregulation of the neuroblast nuclear protein, Distal antenna (Dan). Either prolonging Dan expression or disrupting lamina interfered with hunchback repositioning and extended neuroblast competence. We propose that neuroblasts undergo a developmentally regulated subnuclear genome reorganization to permanently silence Hunchback target genes that results in loss of progenitor competence."
https://openalex.org/W2028600248,"Fatty acids are essential components of the dynamic lipid metabolism in cells. Fatty acids can also signal to intracellular pathways to trigger a broad range of cellular responses. Oleic acid is an abundant monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid that impinges on different biological processes, but the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. Here, we report that oleic acid stimulates the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway and activates the SIRT1-PGC1α transcriptional complex to modulate rates of fatty acid oxidation. In skeletal muscle cells, oleic acid treatment increased intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) that turned on protein kinase A activity. This resulted in SIRT1 phosphorylation at Ser-434 and elevation of its catalytic deacetylase activity. A direct SIRT1 substrate is the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1α), which became deacetylated and hyperactive after oleic acid treatment. Importantly, oleic acid, but not other long chain fatty acids such as palmitate, increased the expression of genes linked to fatty acid oxidation pathway in a SIRT1-PGC1α-dependent mechanism. As a result, oleic acid potently accelerated rates of complete fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle cells. These results illustrate how a single long chain fatty acid specifically controls lipid oxidation through a signaling/transcriptional pathway. Pharmacological manipulation of this lipid signaling pathway might provide therapeutic possibilities to treat metabolic diseases associated with lipid dysregulation."

Kim M.K. Beaven M.A. Burgin A.B. Manganiello V. Chung J.H.

Because the effect of RSV on SirT1 activation is controversial, we have examined the role of SirT1 from the viewpoint that this protein may be required, in part, during muscle mitochondrial biogenesis. We predicted that chronic treatment with RSV may have both SirT1-dependent and -independent effects on the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis that are dependent on the metabolic status of the tissue. To address how SirT1 is involved in muscle mitochondrial function and biogenesis, we compared WT mice with those that express a deacetylase-deficient SirT1 protein driven by a muscle-specific MLCf1-Cre promoter. These mice were either treated with a control or RSV-supplemented diet, while being either maintained sedentary or subjected to exercise training via voluntary wheel running. Similarly, we used chronic electrical stimulation of C2C12 mouse muscle myotubes to examine the differences in mitochondrial biogenesis when induced by RSV, chronic stimulation, or the combination of these treatments. Our study demonstrates that exercise, or chronic contractile activity (CCA), has more robust effects on the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis compared with RSV treatment in either mice or in C2C12 myotubes. However, RSV was shown to act synergistically with exercise to increase mitochondrial content, an effect that was dependent on the presence of SirT1. Embryonic murine skeletal muscle C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) were differentiated into myotubes and stimulated to induce CCA as described earlier (20.Uguccioni G. Hood D.A. The importance of PGC-1α in contractile activity-induced mitochondrial adaptations.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 300: E361-E371Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CCA was performed using either one or four successive 3-h bouts (1- and 4-day protocols) of electrical stimulation (5 Hz, 7 V) with an intervening 21-h recovery period following each 3-h bout. Myotubes were treated separately with CCA or in combination with 100 μm RSV, 50 μm quercetin, or the SirT1 inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM; 5 mm) during both the stimulation and recovery periods. SirT1loxP/loxP mice (generated with heterozygous B6;129-SirT1tm1Ygu/J mice; JAX Laboratory) have a loxP-flanked neomycin cassette upstream of exon 4 and another loxP site downstream of exon 4 that was inserted to create this targeted mutant SirT1 allele. These mice were then bred with MLC1fCre recombinase mice to create a Cre/loxP recombination. MLC1f is a splice variant, along with MLC3f, of the Myl1 gene expressed in fast skeletal muscle fibers. The resulting offspring have exon 4 of the SirT1 gene, encoding 51 amino acids of the SirT1 catalytic domain, deleted in Cre-expressing tissues. We describe our data by referring to the Cre+-SirT1loxP/loxP animals as muscle-specific “SirT1-KO” mice. All experimental mice were paired to the WT Cre-negative SirT1loxP/loxP littermates of the same age and used at ∼2–3 months. Muscle-specific SirT1-KO quadriceps exhibited 50% lower SirT1 activity than WT mice. Residual SirT1 activity was expected from any nonmuscular tissues and muscle fibers not expressing MLCf1. It has been estimated that 45% of the nuclei within skeletal muscle tissue is within muscle cells, whereas the remaining nuclei are composed of other tissue types such as adipocytes, fibroblasts, and Schwann cells (26.Bothe G.W. Haspel J.A. Smith C.L. Wiener H.H. Burden S.J. Selective expression of Cre recombinase in skeletal muscle fibers.Genesis. 2000; 26: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). SirT1 activity was measured using an in vitro SirT1 fluorometric assay (Biomol) as described by the manufacturer and as done previously (27.Chabi B. Adhihetty P.J. O'Leary M.F. Menzies K.J. Hood D.A. Relationship between Sirt1 expression and mitochondrial proteins during conditions of chronic muscle use and disuse.J. Appl. Physiol. 2009; 107: 1730-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The stimulation protocol was performed as described previously (28.Saleem A. Adhihetty P.J. Hood D.A. Role of p53 in mitochondrial biogenesis and apoptosis in skeletal muscle.Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 37: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The sciatic nerve from the gastrocnemius muscle of one leg was stimulated at 1 and 3 tetanic contractions/s for 2 min each, intensities that are sufficient to cause moderate and more severe muscle fatigue, respectively. Following the in situ stimulation protocol, the gastrocnemius muscles from the electrically stimulated leg and the nonstimulated contralateral leg of the animal were excised and weighed. SirT1-KO and WT mice were treated for 9 weeks with RSV. RSV was reconstituted in mouse chow at a concentration of 1 g/kg in a phytoestrogen-free control diet (29.Harper C.E. Patel B.B. Wang J. Arabshahi A. Eltoum I.A. Lamartiniere C.A.

Toxicol. 2007; 45: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This treatment was performed in conjunction with mice that were placed in cages with voluntary running wheels and trained over a 9-week period. Based on their food consumption and body weights, the dose of RSV administered was ∼100 mg of RSV/kg of body mass/day. RSV-treated mice were compared with untrained or trained mice fed control diets. COX and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) staining was performed on 10-μm serial sections of gastrocnemius muscle. After drying for 5 min at room temperature, these sections were immersed in either COX or SDH reaction solutions for 30 min in the dark at 25 °C. COX reaction solution (pH 7.4) contained 16.75 mm sodium phosphate monobasic, 81 mm sodium phosphate biphasic, 5 mm 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine, 90 μm cytochrome c, and 6000 units catalase. The SDH reaction solution (pH 7.6) consisted of 11.5 mm sodium phosphate monobasic, 87 mm sodium phosphate biphasic, 50 mm succinate, 200 μm 1-Methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methosulfate, 1.5 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, and 1 mm sodium azide. The tibialis anterior, triceps, and gastrocnemius muscles from both sides of the animal were quickly harvested, weighed, and placed in ice-cold mitochondrial isolation buffer. The quadriceps muscles were sectioned, freeze-clamped with aluminum tongs pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C for subsequent use in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) enzyme activity measurements and Western blotting analyses. Samples of isolated mitochondria were examined as done previously (28.Saleem A. Adhihetty P.J. Hood D.A. Role of p53 in mitochondrial biogenesis and apoptosis in skeletal muscle.Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 37: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, respiration rates driven by complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain were evaluated in the presence of 10 mm glutamate (state 4 respiration) and glutamate with 0.44 mm ADP (state 3 respiration) using the Mitocell S200 Micro Respirometry System (Strathkelvin Instruments). The addition of NADH during state 3 measurements had no substantial effect on the respiration rate, indicating good inner mitochondrial membrane integrity. In addition, COX activity of the mixed powdered muscle from control and muscle-specific SirT1-KO animals was evaluated as described previously (20.Uguccioni G. Hood D.A. The importance of PGC-1α in contractile activity-induced mitochondrial adaptations.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 300: E361-E371Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the maximal rate of oxidation of reduced cytochrome c using the change in absorbance at 550 nm on a Bio-Tek Synergy HT microplate reader. ROS were measured as described previously (31.Adhihetty P.J. Ljubicic V. Hood D.A. Effect of chronic contractile activity on SS and IMF mitochondrial apoptotic susceptibility in skeletal muscle.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 292: E748-E755Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria from WT and muscle-specific SirT1-KO animals were incubated with VO2 buffer in a 96-well plate. ROS production was assessed at 37 °C for 30 min during state 4 and state 3 respiration by adding 10 mm glutamate or glutamate with 0.44 mm ADP, respectively, immediately prior to the addition of 50 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA, Sigma). The fluorescence emission between 480 and 520 nm, measured with a multidetection micro-plate reader, is directly related to ROS production. ROS production measured in absolute fluorescence units was linear over the entire measurement period. ROS levels were expressed per nanoatom of O2 consumed, measured during the mitochondrial respiration assay. Protein extractions from frozen quadriceps sections were performed as described previously (32.Ljubicic V. Hood D.A. Kinase-specific responsiveness to incremental contractile activity in skeletal muscle with low and high mitochondrial content.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 295: E195-E204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protein extracts of C2C12 myotubes or muscle homogenates were separated via electrophoresis through SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated overnight with antibodies against aciculin, α-tubulin (Calbiochem, CP06), COX-IV (Invitrogen, A21348), phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK; Thr-172; Cell Signaling, 25315), total-AMPKα (Cell Signaling, 2532), phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Thr-182; Cell Signaling, 9211S), total p38 (Cell Signaling, 9212), PGC-1α (Millipore, AB3242), cytochrome c, Nampt (Bethyl; 779A), and SirT1 (Upstate, 05-707). This was followed by a 2-h incubation at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibodies. Western blot signals are semiquantitative and obtained within the linear range of the film. The specificity of the PGC-1α antibody was previously established in our laboratory using siRNA and HA-tagged experiments (20.Uguccioni G. Hood D.A. The importance of PGC-1α in contractile activity-induced mitochondrial adaptations.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 300: E361-E371Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial mass was examined using MTGFM. Cells were stained with 20 nm MTGFM for 45 min at 37 °C in differentiation media. ROS were monitored using H2DCFDA. Cells were preincubated with 5 μm of H2DCFDA for 45 min at 37 °C in differentiation media. Staining for both of these fluorescent probes was performed in 6-well cell culture plates and then quantified using a Bio-Tek Synergy HT microplate reader. Each well was then scraped for protein and quantified using a Bradford assay. All fluorescent values were expressed per microgram of protein. Cells were grown in a 6-well cell culture dish, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 7 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with a 0.1% solution of Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with SirT1 and PGC-1α antibodies. Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were coincubated for 1 h at room temperature. To visualize the nuclei within the myotubes, DAPI was included with the 1-h secondary antibody incubation at a dilution of 0.5 μg/ml. Images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse fluorescent microscope. Comparisons between either control or CCA-treated cells or WT and SirT1-KO animals were evaluated using two-way analyses of variance on each of the treatment conditions. Bonferroni post-tests were performed when applicable, and all error bars represent mean ± S.E. Additionally, the interaction term of a two-factor analysis of variance was used to test for synergism when examining a combined treatment of RSV and CCA or exercise, as described previously (33.Slinker B.K. The statistics of synergism.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 723-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), with significance defined as p < 0.05. To document the effectiveness of RSV in differentiated muscle cells, we examined the phosphorylation of AMPK and p38 as early indicators of the onset of downstream metabolic effects, as is seen with acute contractile activity (32.Ljubicic V. Hood D.A. Kinase-specific responsiveness to incremental contractile activity in skeletal muscle with low and high mitochondrial content.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 295: E195-E204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Following short term RSV treatment (1 h), AMPK phosphorylation increased by 1.7-fold (p < 0.05), although p38 phosphorylation was not significantly increased (Fig. 1, A and B). To examine the persistence of the RSV effect, and to compare this with contractile activity, a model of exercise, we electrically stimulated C2C12 myotubes for 3 h followed by 21 h of recovery in the presence or absence of RSV for the full 24 h (1-day protocol). The acute RSV effect on AMPK phosphorylation observed at 1 h (Fig. 1B) dissipated by 24 h (Fig. 1C). However, CA followed by recovery had a pronounced 3-fold impact on AMPK phosphorylation. These effects were not influenced by RSV or by the SirT1 inhibitor NAM. In contrast, the phosphorylation levels of p38 increased 6-fold with RSV treatment alone, 8-fold with CA alone, and 9.5-fold with the combined treatment of RSV and CA (p < 0.05; Fig. 1D). The effects of RSV and CA on p38 phosphorylation were SirT1-independent, as NAM did not attenuate the RSV- or CA-induced effects. These data indicate that the response to RSV is kinase-specific. RSV is clearly effective in triggering several early signaling pathways associated with mitochondrial biogenesis in C2C12 myotubes, but it acts on these kinases in a temporally divergent manner. Because the effects of RSV and CA on early signaling pathways linked to mitochondrial biogenesis were distinct, we combined these treatments in subsequent long term experiments (4-day protocol) to see if they exhibited an additive effect on mitochondrial content and function. It has been previously demonstrated that the coordination between SirT1 and PGC-1α expression/activity is important for the induction of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (6.Amat R. Planavila A. Chen S.L. Iglesias R. Giralt M. Villarroya F. SIRT1 controls the transcription of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator-1α (PGC-1α) gene in skeletal muscle through the PGC-1α autoregulatory loop and interaction with MyoD.J.

Puigserver P. Metabolic control of muscle mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation through SIRT1/PGC-1α.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). To investigate whether chronic treatment of RSV, or chronic contractile activity (CCA), could induce this coordinated response, C2C12 myotubes were treated with CCA and RSV over a 4-day period. RSV treatment induced a 2-fold increase in SirT1 protein expression (p < 0.05; Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, CCA resulted in no increase in SirT1 expression. Alternatively, RSV did not alter PGC-1α protein levels, but PGC-1α expression increased 1.6-fold following 4 days of CCA (p < 0.05; Fig. 2, A and C). The basis for increases in PGC-1 with CCA may be related to the transient elevations in p38 and AMPK phosphorylation, as shown in Fig. 1, as both kinases are known to be important regulators of PGC-1 expression (35.Gibala M.J.

It has been implicated in hyperglycemia-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis. As high glucose and oxidative stress mediate diabetic nephropathy (DN), the contribution of TxNIP was investigated in renal mesangial cell reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and collagen synthesis. To determine the role of TxNIP, mouse mesangial cells (MC) cultured from wild-type C3H and TxNIP-deficient Hcb-19 mice were incubated in HG. Confocal microscopy was used to measure total and mitochondrial ROS production (DCF and MitoSOX) and collagen IV. Trx and NADPH oxidase activities were assayed and NADPH oxidase isoforms, Nox2 and Nox4, and antioxidant enzymes were determined by immunoblotting. C3H MC exposed to HG elicited a significant increase in cellular and mitochondrial ROS as well as Nox4 protein expression and NADPH oxidase activation, whereas Hcb-19 MC showed no response. Trx activity was attenuated by HG only in C3H MC. These defects in Hcb-19 MC were not due to increased antioxidant enzymes or scavenging of ROS, but associated with decreased ROS generation. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of TxNIP in Hcb-19 MC and TxNIP knockdown with siRNA in C3H confirmed the specific role of TxNIP. Collagen IV accumulation in HG was markedly reduced in Hcb-19 cells. TxNIP is a critical component of the HG-ROS signaling pathway, required for the induction of mitochondrial and total cell ROS and the NADPH oxidase isoform, Nox4. TxNIP is a potential target to prevent DN."

Analysis of Df(16)A(+/-) mice, which model this microdeletion, revealed abnormalities in the formation of neuronal dendrites and spines, as well as altered brain microRNAs. Here, we show a drastic reduction of miR-185, which resides within the 22q11.2 locus, to levels more than expected by a hemizygous deletion, and we demonstrate that this reduction alters dendritic and spine development. miR-185 represses, through an evolutionarily conserved target site, a previously unknown inhibitor of these processes that resides in the Golgi apparatus and shows higher prenatal brain expression. Sustained derepression of this inhibitor after birth represents the most robust transcriptional disturbance in the brains of Df(16)A(+/-) mice and results in structural alterations in the hippocampus. Reduction of miR-185 also has milder age- and region-specific effects on the expression of some Golgi-related genes. Our findings illuminate the contribution of microRNAs in psychiatric disorders and cognitive dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2116453847,"A mechanistic description of metazoan transcription is essential for understanding the molecular processes that govern cellular decisions. To provide structural insights into the DNA recognition step of transcription initiation, we used single-particle electron microscopy (EM) to visualize human TFIID with promoter DNA. This analysis revealed that TFIID coexists in two predominant and distinct structural states that differ by a 100 Å translocation of TFIID's lobe A. The transition between these structural states is modulated by TFIIA, as the presence of TFIIA and promoter DNA facilitates the formation of a rearranged state of TFIID that enables promoter recognition and binding. DNA labeling and footprinting, together with cryo-EM studies, were used to map the locations of TATA, Initiator (Inr), motif ten element (MTE), and downstream core promoter element (DPE) promoter motifs within the TFIID-TFIIA-DNA structure. The existence of two structurally and functionally distinct forms of TFIID suggests that the different conformers may serve as specific targets for the action of regulatory factors."

We report the crystal structure of a ternary complex of human SLBP RNA binding domain, human 3'hExo, and a 26-nucleotide SL RNA. Only one base of the SL is recognized specifically by SLBP, and the two proteins primarily recognize the shape of the RNA.

https://openalex.org/W1971218315,"The six-transmembrane protein glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2 (GDE2) induces spinal motor neuron differentiation by inhibiting Notch signaling in adjacent motor neuron progenitors. GDE2 function requires activity of its extracellular domain that shares homology with glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GDPDs). GDPDs metabolize glycerophosphodiesters into glycerol-3-phosphate and corresponding alcohols, but whether GDE2 inhibits Notch signaling by this mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that GDE2, unlike classical GDPDs, cleaves glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. GDE2 GDPD activity inactivates the Notch activator RECK (reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs) by releasing it from the membrane through GPI-anchor cleavage. RECK release disinhibits ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) protease-dependent shedding of the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1), leading to Notch inactivation. This study identifies a previously unrecognized mechanism to initiate neurogenesis that involves GDE2-mediated surface cleavage of GPI-anchored targets to inhibit Dll1-Notch signaling."

DNA replication is tightly regulated to ensure accurate duplication of genetic information. In response to DNA damage or replication stress, replication forks stall in front of DNA lesions. A stalled replication fork is arrested, but is still capable of resuming replication once the lesion is repaired or bypassed. It is believed that DNA damage or stalled replication forks activates ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)2Zou L. Elledge S.J.

Activated ATM and ATR phosphorylate downstream targets including checkpoint kinases, which are able to protect the stalled replication forks and prevent the fork from collapsing. In the absence of proper DNA damage repair or replication checkpoints, stalled replication forks will dissociate, leading to the generation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), genomic instability, and eventually tumor development.

The ATRX protein contains several highly conserved domains, including the N-terminal ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain and the C-terminal SNF2 ATPase and HELIC domain that confer helicase activity (Fig. 1A). Many of the SNF2 proteins use the energy generated from ATP hydrolysis to translocate along DNA and thereby remodel DNA structures or DNA-protein interactions. Most of the ATRX mutations were found in the ADD domain and the helicase domain, which is highly associated with the ATRX syndrome (13Higgs D.R. Garrick D. Anguita E. De Gobbi M. Hughes J. Muers M.

In addition, ATRX is implicated in mitotic and meiotic regulation. For example, in ATRX knockdown HeLa cells, a subset of metaphase chromosomes failed to condense and the sister chromatids lacked centromeric cohesion, which coincided with spindle checkpoint activation in these cells (16Ritchie K. Seah C. Moulin J. Isaac C. Dick F. Bérubé N.G. Loss of ATRX leads to chromosome cohesion and congression defects.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Presence of micronuclei following G1 entry was also observed in ATRX knockdown cells (16Ritchie K. Seah C. Moulin J. Isaac C. Dick F. Bérubé N.G.

Here, we sought to uncover the functions of ATRX in DNA damage response. By knocking out ATRX gene somatically, we were able to show that ATRX is involved in replication stress tolerance. We also demonstrated that ATRX is recruited to the DNA damage site. We showed that ATRX is required for proper S phase progression and replication restart. Moreover, we uncovered MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex as ATRX-associated proteins in vivo. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel role for ATRX in the maintenance of genomic stability. HCT116 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and kept at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Full-length ATRX cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Yang Shi in Harvard Medical School. The cDNAs were cloned into gateway compatible pDONR 201 and subcloned into an expression vector haboring N-terminal SFB tags for expression in mammalian cells. The primary antibodies used in this study were purchased as follows: polyclonal anti-ATRX antibody, monoclonal anti-PML antibody, monoclonal anti-Chk1 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; monoclonal anti-Flag antibody, monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody were from Sigma Aldrich; polyclonal anti-pHistone3 (S10) antibody, polyclonal anti-Histone3 antibody were from Millipore; polyclonal anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody was from Abcam, Inc; rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.; Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rat antibody was from Molecular Probes, Inc.; polyclonal anti-γH2AX were produced in house used as previously described (26Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J. RNF8 transduces the DNA-damage signal via histone ubiquitylation and checkpoint protein assembly.Cell. 2007; 131: 901-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Thymidine, hydroxyurea, and aphidicolin were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used at the indicated concentrations. Generation of somatic knock-out cells was performed as previously described using adeno-associated virus-based strategy (27Leung J.W. Wang Y. Fong K.W. Huen M.S. Li L. Chen J. Fanconi anemia (FA) binding protein FAAP20 stabilizes FA complementation group A (FANCA) and participates in interstrand cross-link repair.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 4491-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, homology arms targeting exon 5 were cloned into the targeting vector. The targeting adeno-associated viruses were packaged in 293T cells by transfecting 3 μg of the targeting vector together with pHelper and pRC plasmids. Viruses were harvested at 72 h after transfection. Human colon cancer cell line HCT116 was infected for 48 h and selected with geneticin for 20 days. The targeted allele was screened by genomic PCR. The protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis. ATRX-deficient HCT116 cells and wild-type HCT116 cells were exposed to differing doses of irradiation (IR) or aphidicolin (APH), hydroxyurea (HU), mitomycin C (MMC) for 24 h. Cells were then washed free of drugs and incubated in fresh medium for another 14 days. The cells were then fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol. Colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted and normalized for plating efficiencies. Cells were lysed in NETN (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v)) containing protease inhibitors. For immunoblotting analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, incubated overnight in primary antibodies as indicated, followed by 1 h of incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were cultured on coverslips and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton solution. Cells were then incubated with indicated primary antibodies for 30 min, washed, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min. Cells were then counterstained with DAPI and mounted with anti-fade solution. For BrdU incorporation analysis, cells were synchronized with 1 mm thymidine and released according to standard protocol (28Ma H.T. Poon R.Y. Synchronization of HeLa cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 761: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cells were pulsed with 10 μm BrdU for 30 min prior to harvesting. Cells were trypsinized and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. Cells were then washed and treated with 2 m HCl for 30 min. Cells were washed again with PBS three times and stained with primary BrdU antibody followed by goat anti-mouse FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. For pH3 (Ser-10) staining, cells were incubated with 2 mm HU for 24 h. After extensive washing, cells were incubated in fresh medium containing nocodazole; the proportion of mitotic cells at indicated time points was measured. For FACS analysis, fixed cells were stained with propidium iodide (4 μg/ml), treated with RNase (2 μg/ml) at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were then analyzed in flow cytometer using FACS Flow Jo software. Preparation of chromatin fractions was described previously (26Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J. RNF8 transduces the DNA-damage signal via histone ubiquitylation and checkpoint protein assembly.Cell. 2007; 131: 901-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested at indicated times after treatment. The soluble fraction was extracted with NETN buffer at 4 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation with 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.2 m HCl. The soluble fraction was neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 before further analysis. Cells were seeded on 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp.) and incubated overnight. Cells were micro-irradiated with a Micropoint Ablation System (Photonics Instruments, St. Charles, IL) with the laser output set to 35%. Average of 20 cells were micro-irradiated and further cultured for 6 h prior to immunostaining and then visualized with a Nikon Elipse TE2000-U inverted microscope (29Ghosal G. Leung J.W. Nair B.C. Fong K.W. Chen J. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-binding protein C1orf124 is a regulator of translesion synthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 34225-34233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with 20 μm IdU for 15 min followed by 20 μm thymidine for 15 min to chase out the IdU. After pre-labeling, the cells were treated with 2 mm HU for 2, 6, or 24 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with 100 μm CldU for 15 min. For DNA fiber length measurement, cells were synchronized with the addition of 100 nm nocodazole in culture media. After 8 h of incubation, rounded mitotic cells were shaken off and washed three times with PBS. The cells were then replated in fresh medium. 9 h after replating, when the majority of the cells were in early S-phase, cells were labeled with IdU for 15 min followed by 6 h of incubation of 4 mm HU. Cells were then washed with PBS and pulsed with 100 μm CldU for indicated time points. DNA spreads were prepared as previously described (30Jackson D.A. Pombo A. Replicon clusters are stable units of chromosome structure: evidence that nuclear organization contributes to the efficient activation and propagation of S phase in human cells.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). DNA fiber staining was performed as previously described (25Yuan J. Ghosal G. Chen J. The HARP-like domain-containing protein AH2/ZRANB3 binds to PCNA and participates in cellular response to replication stress.Mol. Cell. 2012; 47: 410-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The significance of the difference between the means was determined by Student's t test. HEK293T cells stably expressing SFB-tagged ATRX were established. Expression of exogenous ATRX was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Tandem affinity purification was conducted at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in NETN buffer for 30 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min and rocked with streptavidin-conjugated beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. The immunocomplexes were washed with NETN for three times and eluted with 2 mg/ml biotin. The eluent was incubated with S-protein agarose beads (Novagen) for 2 h. The beads were then washed, eluted, and analyzed by Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA.). HEK293T cells were harvested in NETN buffer containing protease inhibitors 24 h after transiently transfected with plasmids encoding SFB-tagged proteins. Crude lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were then incubated with streptavidin beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The complexes were washed with NETN for three times, eluted by boiling in 1× Laemmli buffer, and then subjected to Western blotting analysis. To study ATRX gene function in DNA damage response, we employed a loss-of-function approach by generating somatic ATRX knock-out cell lines. We designed a targeting construct and specifically deleted exon 5 of the ATRX gene to generate a transcription frameshift (Fig. 1, B and C). Absence of ATRX expression in knock-out cells was confirmed by PCR, Western blotting as well as immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1, D–F). ATRX is predominately localized in nuclei with nuclear bodies that co-localize with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). PML-NBs contain PML protein and are associated with various nuclear functions including DNA repair (31Boe S.O. Haave M. Jul-Larsen A. Grudic A. Bjerkvig R. Lonning P.E. Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies are predetermined processing sites for damaged DNA.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3284-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Notably, ATRX-deficient cells consistently showed bigger and brighter PML bodies than those observed in parental wild-type HCT116 cells (Fig. 1G). This observation is consistent with a previous report (32Heaphy C.M. de Wilde R.F. Jiao Y. Klein A.P. Edil B.H. Shi C. Bettegowda C. Rodriguez F.J. Eberhart C.G. Hebbar S. Offerhaus G.J. McLendon R. Rasheed B.A. He Y. Yan H. Bigner D.D. Oba-Shinjo S.M. Marie S.K. Riggins G.J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Hruban R.H. Maitra A. Papadopoulos N. Meeker A.K. Altered telomeres in tumors with ATRX and DAXX mutations.Science. 2011; 333: 425Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). These larger PML-NBs are speculated to be the ALT-associated PML-NBs, which are present in ALT-positive cells and correspond to telomere location in these cells (33Draskovic I. Arnoult N. Steiner V. Bacchetti S. Lomonte P. Londoño-Vallejo A. Probing PML body function in ALT cells reveals spatiotemporal requirements for telomere recombination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15726-15731Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because of the genomic instability reported in ATRX knockdown cells as well as in ATRX-deficient ALT cells (11Lovejoy C.A. Li W. Reisenweber S. Thongthip S. Bruno J. de Lange T. De S. Petrini J.H. Sung P.A. Jasin M. Rosenbluh J. Zwang Y. Weir B.A. Hatton C. Ivanova E. Macconaill L. Hanna M. Hahn W.C. Lue N.F. Reddel R.R. Jiao Y. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Papadopoulos N. Meeker A.K. Loss of ATRX, genome instability, and an altered DNA damage response are hallmarks of the alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002772Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 16Ritchie K. Seah C. Moulin J. Isaac C. Dick F. Bérubé N.G. Loss of ATRX leads to chromosome cohesion and congression defects.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we speculated that ATRX may play a role in DNA damage response. To test this hypothesis, we treated wild-type and two independent clones of ATRX-deficient cells with different genotoxic agents. As shown in Fig. 2A, ATRX-deficient cells are more sensitive to HU and APH treatment. However, ATRX-deficient cells did not show any increased sensitivity to MMC or irradiation (IR) (Fig. 2A), suggesting that ATRX may be specifically involved in replication stress response. Cells undergoing replicative stress often encounter problems while progressing through S phase and therefore show an increase of S phase cells. Indeed, we observed an increased S phase population in ATRX deficient cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, ATRX-deficient cells showed a significant increase in BrdU-positive S phase population 4 or 8 h after double thymidine block/release when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Strikingly, ATRX-deficient cells displayed an increase in γH2AX positive cells 4 h after release from thymidine block (Fig. 2E) as well as 2 h following HU treatment (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that more DSBs were generated during normal and stressed replication in the absence of ATRX. This may explain the increased sensitivity to replication stress observed in ATRX-deficient cells (Fig. 2A). To determine whether ATRX is directly involved in DNA damage response, we examined ATRX localization upon DNA damage. Endogenous ATRX co-localized with single-strand DNA-binding protein RPA2 following laser-induced micro-irradiation (Fig. 3C), indicating that ATRX localizes to DNA damage sites. However, we were not able to clearly demonstrate ATRX foci formation upon HU treatment. This is likely due to the fact that ATRX is concentrated at heterochromatin as well as PML bodies, which make it difficult to spot damage-induced ATRX foci. Therefore we used fractionation assay and indeed observed HU-induced chromatin enrichment of ATRX (Fig. 3D). Together, these data suggest that ATRX may participate in replication stress pathway. To further explore the functional role of ATRX upon replication stress, we treated the cells with increasing doses of HU and examined checkpoint activation using CHK1 phosphorylation as readout. Consistently, pCHK1 (S317) is greatly reduced in ATRX-deficient cells treated with low dose of HU (Fig. 3E), indicating that ATRX is required for efficient checkpoint activation in response to replication stress. Cells with defective replication checkpoint often do not recover efficiently from HU arrest. Notably, ATRX-deficient cells exhibited slower mitotic entry after release from HU (Fig. 4A). Moreover, we observed a dramatic increase of stalled replication forks and a reduction in new origin firing in ATRX-deficient cells after treatment of HU for 2 and 6 h (Fig. 4, B and D). However, both wild-type and ATRX-deficient cells showed similar increase of stalled forks after 24 h of incubation of HU, which is similar to a previous report (34Petermann E. Orta M.L. Issaeva N. Schultz N. Helleday T. Hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks become progressively inactivated and require two different RAD51-mediated pathways for restart and repair.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 492-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). These data suggest that ATRX only delay but not block fork collapse following replication stress. There is no significant difference in the lengths of DNA fibers after HU release over time in wild-type or ATRX knock-out cells (Fig. 4C), indicating that ATRX does not play any role in regulating the rate of DNA replication. In an attempt to understand the underlying mechanism by which ATRX participates in replication stress response, we established HEK293T cells stably expressing hATRX harboring N-terminal SFB (S-protein, Flag, Streptavidin)-tag and performed tandem affinity purification to identify potential ATRX-interacting proteins by mass spectrometry analysis. DAXX, a well-known ATRX binding partner, co-purified with ATRX (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the MRN complex (MRE11A-RAD50-NBS1) also co-purified from ATRX. To further confirm this interaction, we transiently co-expressed SFB-ATRX with myc-MRE11A, myc-RAD50, or myc-NBS1 in HEK293T cells and performed co-precipitation experiments. Our data showed that ATRX pulled down NBS1, but not the other two components in the MRN complex (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that ATRX is a putative binding partner of MRN complex, possibly through its interaction with NBS1, and may function with MRN in DNA damage response. Impaired replication fork progression and increased replication-dependent DNA damage were found in early stages of tumor development (35Bartkova J. Rezaei N. Liontos M. Karakaidos P. Kletsas D. Issaeva N. Vassiliou L.V. Kolettas E. Niforou K. Zoumpourlis V.C. Takaoka M. Nakagawa H. Tort F. Fugger K. Johansson F. Sehested M. Andersen C.L. Dyrskjot L. Ørntoft T. Lukas J. Kittas C. Helleday T.

Oncogene-induced senescence is part of the tumorigenesis barrier imposed by DNA damage checkpoints.Nature. 2006; 444: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 36Di Micco R. Fumagalli M. Cicalese A. Piccinin S. Gasparini P. Luise C. Schurra C. Garre′ M. Nuciforo P.G. Bensimon A. Maestro R. Pelicci P.G. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Oncogene-induced senescence is a DNA damage response triggered by DNA hyper-replication.Nature. 2006; 444: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Tight regulation of DNA replication, including efficient reactivation of stalled replication forks, is essential to maintain faithful replication and genome stability. ATRX-deficient cells fail to resume replication after HU treatment, indicating that the stalled replication forks may be collapsed. The slower progression through S phase and delayed mitotic entry observed in ATRX-deficient cells could be due to stalled replication forks in the absence of ATRX. Indeed, a recent study showed a similar observation on the delayed S-phase progression upon ATRX inactivation (37Huh M.S. Price O'Dea T. Ouazia D. McKay B.C. Parise G. Parks R.J. Rudnicki M.A. Picketts D.J. Compromised genomic integrity impedes muscle growth after Atrx inactivation.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 4412-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These replication defects in ATRX deficient cells may lead to reduced number of replication forks in these cells, and therefore indirectly affect Chk1 activation in response to HU, as we observed in this study. A previous report demonstrated that Chk1 inhibits origin initiation (38Ge X.Q. Blow J.J. Chk1 inhibits replication factory activation but allows dormant origin firing in existing factories.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1285-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, in the current study, ATRX knock-out cells displayed reduced pChk1 and also a reduction in origin firing. It is possible that inefficient CIdU incorporation in ATRX-deficient cells after releasing from HU may contribute to this phenomenon. ATRX, as a chromatin remodeler that binds to specific DNA structures including unusual DNA structures, short repetitive sequences and G-4 quadruplex, is recruited to telomere ends and participates in the resolution of G4-quadruplex structure (20Law M.J. Lower K.M. Voon H.P. Hughes J.R. Garrick D. Viprakasit V. Mitson M. De Gobbi M. Marra M. Morris A. Abbott A. Wilder S.P. Taylor S. Santos G.M. Cross J. Ayyub H. Jones S. Ragoussis J. Rhodes D.

This may subsequently facilitate the resumption of replication and mitotic entry. However, ATRX may also play a more direct role in replication checkpoint control. ATRX could function with other proteins, such as MRN complex, to protect stalled replication forks upon replication stress. Recently studies showed that MRE11A and NBS1 are important for promoting replication restart (39Falck J. Forment J.V. Coates J. Mistrik M. Lukas J. Bartek J. Jackson S.P. CDK targeting of NBS1 promotes DNA-end resection, replication restart, and homologous recombination.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Bryant H.E. Petermann E. Schultz N. Jemth A.S. Loseva O. Issaeva N. Johansson F. Fernandez S. McGlynn P. Helleday T. PARP is activated at stalled forks to mediate Mre11-dependent replication restart and recombination.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2601-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). A study in yeast demonstrated that MRN complex is recruited to stalled forks to stabilize replisome (41Tittel-Elmer M. Alabert C. Pasero P. Cobb J.A. The MRX complex stabilizes the replisome independently of the S phase checkpoint during replication stress.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1142-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, MRN complex is required for promoting the resumption of DNA replication following stress (41Tittel-Elmer M. Alabert C. Pasero P. Cobb J.A. The MRX complex stabilizes the replisome independently of the S phase checkpoint during replication stress.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1142-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The association between MRN complex and ATRX provides a possible explanation as to how ATRX may be involved in replication stress pathway. Unfortunately, due to the large size of ATRX protein, we were not able to reconstitute the ATRX knock-out cells with wild-type ATRX expression. Thus, we were unable to further pursue the functional significance of ATRX/MRN interaction in replication checkpoint control. In conclusion, we showed that ATRX promotes checkpoint activation upon modest replication stress. ATRX participates in restart of stalled replication forks and recovery from replication stress. Moreover, ATRX localized to DNA damage sites and associated with the MRN complex. These results suggest that ATRX may be directly involved in replication stress response, adding yet another imperative function to the expanding roles of ATRX in the maintenance of genomic stability.

https://openalex.org/W2148153922,"The UCS (UNC-45/CRO1/She4) chaperones play an evolutionarily conserved role in promoting myosin-dependent processes, including cytokinesis, endocytosis, RNA transport, and muscle development. To investigate the protein machinery orchestrating myosin folding and assembly, we performed a comprehensive analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-45. Our structural and biochemical data demonstrate that UNC-45 forms linear protein chains that offer multiple binding sites for cooperating chaperones and client proteins. Accordingly, Hsp70 and Hsp90, which bind to the TPR domain of UNC-45, could act in concert and with defined periodicity on captured myosin molecules. In vivo analyses reveal the elongated canyon of the UCS domain as a myosin-binding site and show that multimeric UNC-45 chains support organization of sarcomeric repeats. In fact, expression of transgenes blocking UNC-45 chain formation induces dominant-negative defects in the sarcomere structure and function of wild-type worms. Together, these findings uncover a filament assembly factor that directly couples myosin folding with myofilament formation."
https://openalex.org/W1984448159,"The IκB kinase complex (IKK) is a key regulator of immune responses, inflammation, cell survival, and tumorigenesis. The prosurvival function of IKK centers on activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, whose target gene products inhibit caspases and prevent prolonged JNK activation. Here, we report that inactivation of the BH3-only protein BAD by IKK independently of NF-κB activation suppresses TNFα-induced apoptosis. TNFα-treated Ikkβ(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) undergo apoptosis significantly faster than MEFs deficient in both RelA and cRel due to lack of inhibition of BAD by IKK. IKK phosphorylates BAD at serine-26 (Ser26) and primes it for inactivation. Elimination of Ser26 phosphorylation promotes BAD proapoptotic activity, thereby accelerating TNFα-induced apoptosis in cultured cells and increasing mortality in animals. Our results reveal that IKK inhibits TNFα-induced apoptosis through two distinct but cooperative mechanisms: activation of the survival factor NF-κB and inactivation of the proapoptotic BH3-only BAD protein."
https://openalex.org/W2079438044,"There are various types of autophagy, which can be categorized as nonselective or selective. Macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process through which cells degrade and recycle cytoplasm. Nonselective macroautophagy randomly engulfs a portion of the cytoplasm into autophagosomes and then delivers them to the vacuole (in fungi or plants) or the lysosome (in other higher eukaryotes) for degradation. Selective macroautophagy, however, specifically recognizes and degrades a particular cargo, either a protein complex, an organelle, or an invading microbe. The morphological hallmark of macroautophagy is the formation of an initial sequestering compartment, the phagophore, which expands into the double-membrane autophagosome; the initial sequestration occurs in a compartment that is separate from the degradative organelle. Selective microautophagy utilizes the same cellular machinery, but in this case, the sequestration event takes place directly at the limiting membrane of the lysosome/vacuole. In higher eukaryotes, selective types of autophagy also include chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and two similar processes, endosomal microautophagy (e-MI) and chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA), each of which involves uptake at the limiting membrane of either the lysosome or endosome. In all cases, how a substrate is targeted for sequestration and segregated from other parts of the cell is one of the major questions in this research field. Nonselective autophagy is primarily a starvation response, whereas cells use selective autophagy for a variety of purposes, including remodeling to adapt to changing environmental/nutritional conditions and to eliminate damaged organelles. Accordingly, defects in selective autophagy are associated with a range of pathophysiologies in humans, including certain types of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2071395262,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their ligands have been implicated in progression and metastasis of several cancers. GPCRs signal through heterotrimeric G proteins, and among the different types of G proteins, GNA12/13 have been most closely linked to tumor progression. In this study, we explored the role of GNA13 in prostate cancer cell invasion and the mechanism of up-regulation of GNA13 in these cells. An initial screen for GNA13 protein expression showed that GNA13 is highly expressed in the most aggressive cancer cell lines. Knockdown of GNA13 in highly invasive PC3 cells revealed that these cells depend on GNA13 expression for their invasion, migration, and Rho activation. As mRNA levels in these cells did not correlate with protein levels, we assessed the potential involvement of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in post-transcriptional control of GNA13 expression. Expression analysis of miRNAs predicted to bind the 3'-UTR of GNA13 revealed that miR-182 and miR-141/200a showed an inverse correlation to the protein expression in LnCAP and PC3 cells. Ectopic expression of miR-182 and miR-141/200a in PC3 cells significantly reduced protein levels, GNA13-3'-UTR reporter activity and in vitro invasion of these cells. This effect was blocked by restoration of GNA13 expression in these cells. Importantly, inhibition of miR-182 and miR-141/200a in LnCAP cells using specific miRNA inhibitors elevated the expression of GNA13 and enhanced invasion of these cells. These data provide strong evidence that GNA13 is an important mediator of prostate cancer cell invasion, and that miR-182 and miR-200 family members regulate its expression post-transcriptionally."
https://openalex.org/W2125231275,"The majority of riboswitches are regulatory RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding small-molecule metabolites. Here we report the discovery of an aminoglycoside-binding riboswitch that is widely distributed among antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. This riboswitch is present in the leader RNA of the resistance genes that encode the aminoglycoside acetyl transferase (AAC) and aminoglycoside adenyl transferase (AAD) enzymes that confer resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics through modification of the drugs. We show that expression of the AAC and AAD resistance genes is regulated by aminoglycoside binding to a secondary structure in their 5′ leader RNA. Reporter gene expression, direct measurements of drug RNA binding, chemical probing, and UV crosslinking combined with mutational analysis demonstrate that the leader RNA functions as an aminoglycoside-sensing riboswitch in which drug binding to the leader RNA leads to the induction of aminoglycosides antibiotic resistance."

Disruption of endogenous Gadd45a promotes tube formation and migration of endothelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2069659439,"We propose a concept for the folding and self-assembly of the pore-forming TatA complex from the Twin-arginine translocase and of other membrane proteins based on electrostatic ""charge zippers."" Each subunit of TatA consists of a transmembrane segment, an amphiphilic helix (APH), and a C-terminal densely charged region (DCR). The sequence of charges in the DCR is complementary to the charge pattern on the APH, suggesting that the protein can be ""zipped up"" by a ladder of seven salt bridges. The length of the resulting hairpin matches the lipid bilayer thickness, hence a transmembrane pore could self-assemble via intra- and intermolecular salt bridges. The steric feasibility was rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental evidence was obtained by monitoring the monomer-oligomer equilibrium of specific charge mutants. Similar ""charge zippers"" are proposed for other membrane-associated proteins, e.g., the biofilm-inducing peptide TisB, the human antimicrobial peptide dermcidin, and the pestiviral E(RNS) protein."

https://openalex.org/W1984589081,"Amyloid fibrils can be generated from proteins with diverse sequences and folds. Although amyloid fibrils assembled in vitro commonly involve a single protein precursor, fibrils formed in vivo can contain more than one protein sequence. How fibril structure and stability differ in fibrils composed of single proteins (homopolymeric fibrils) from those generated by co-polymerization of more than one protein sequence (heteropolymeric fibrils) is poorly understood. Here we compare the structure and stability of homo and heteropolymeric fibrils formed from human β2-microglobulin and its truncated variant ΔN6. We use an array of approaches (limited proteolysis, magic angle spinning NMR, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and fluorescence) combined with measurements of thermodynamic stability to characterize the different fibril types. The results reveal fibrils with different structural properties, different side-chain packing, and strikingly different stabilities. These findings demonstrate how co-polymerization of related precursor sequences can expand the repertoire of structural and thermodynamic polymorphism in amyloid fibrils to an extent that is greater than that obtained by polymerization of a single precursor alone."
https://openalex.org/W2028419296,"Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of increased vascular inflammation, dyslipidemia, and the development of atherosclerosis in diabetes. Previous studies have reported lower levels of Mn(2+) in the plasma and lymphocytes of diabetic patients and in the heart and aortic tissue of patients with atherosclerosis. This study examines the hypothesis that Mn(2+) supplementation can reduce the markers/risk factors of endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured with or without Mn(2+) supplementation and then exposed to high glucose (HG, 25 mm) to mimic diabetic conditions. Mn(2+) supplementation caused a reduction in monocyte adhesion to HUVECs treated with HG or MCP-1. Mn(2+) also inhibited ROS levels, MCP-1 secretion, and ICAM-1 up-regulation in HUVECs treated with HG. Silencing studies using siRNA against MnSOD showed that similar results were observed in MnSOD knockdown HUVECs following Mn(2+) supplementation, suggesting that the effect of manganese on monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is mediated by ROS and ICAM-1, but not MnSOD. To validate the relevance of our findings in vivo, Zucker diabetic fatty rats were gavaged daily with water (placebo) or MnCl2 (16 mg/kg of body weight) for 7 weeks. When compared with placebo, Mn(2+)-supplemented rats showed lower blood levels of ICAM-1 (17%, p < 0.04), cholesterol (25%, p < 0.05), and MCP-1 (28%, p = 0.25). These in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that Mn(2+) supplementation can down-regulate ICAM-1 expression and ROS independently of MnSOD, leading to a decrease in monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, and therefore can lower the risk of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2094844863,"Polysialic acid (PSA) is a homopolymeric glycan that plays crucial roles in the developing and adult nervous system. So far only a few PSA-binding proteins have been identified. Here, we identify myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) as novel PSA binding partner. Binding assays showed a direct interaction between PSA and a peptide comprising the effector domain of MARCKS (MARCKS-ED). Co-immunoprecipitation of PSA-carrying neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) with MARCKS and co-immunostaining of MARCKS and PSA at the cell membrane of hippocampal neurons confirm the interaction between PSA and MARCKS. Co-localization and an intimate interaction of PSA and MARCKS at the cell surface was seen by confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis after the addition of fluorescently labeled PSA or PSA-NCAM to live CHO cells or hippocampal neurons expressing MARCKS as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Cross-linking experiments showed that extracellularly applied PSA or PSA-NCAM and intracellularly expressed MARCKS-GFP are in close contact, suggesting that PSA and MARCKS interact with each other at the plasma membrane from opposite sides. Insertion of PSA and MARCKS-ED peptide into lipid bilayers from opposite sides alters the electric properties of the bilayer confirming the notion that PSA and the effector domain of MARCKS interact at and/or within the plane of the membrane. The MARCKS-ED peptide abolished PSA-induced enhancement of neurite outgrowth from cultured hippocampal neurons indicating an important functional role for the interaction between MARCKS and PSA in the developing and adult nervous system."

The observation that siRNA-dependent target RNA slicing activity (the kcat) was decreased by base mismatches in the 3′ region of guide RNA led to the proposal of a two-state model in which extended small RNA-target interactions (in the form of longer duplex) activate the slicer function of the Argonaute protein (18Tomari Y.

Corroborating these ideas, structures of Thermus thermophilus Argonaute that include both 21-nt DNA and target RNA strands with 12, 15, or 19 complementary bases, showed that the PAZ domain interaction with the 3′ terminus is lost when the region of complementarity exceeds 15 bp (17Wang Y.

The crystal structure of human Argonaute2.Science. 2012; 336: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), proposed that an adaptable surface loop in the PIWI domain interacts with the PAZ domain only when miRNA is bound. Interestingly, targets with imperfect complementarity also trigger a reorganization of the Argonaute protein; however, this reorganization fails to liberate the 3′ end of the guide RNA from the PAZ domain (6Wang Y. Sheng G. Juranek S. Tuschl T. Patel D.J. Structure of the guide-strand-containing argonaute silencing complex.Nature. 2008; 456: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Structural alignment of Argonautes with miRNA and imperfect or perfect targets shows prominent differences localized within the PAZ domain (see Fig. 1A). In this study, we developed in vitro and cell-based assays to study the interactions between DmAgo1 and DmAgo2, miRNA, and various target RNAs to investigate how the PAZ domain regulates interdomain interactions and slicer activity. Our biochemical data indicate that the interactions between the 3′ end of the miRNA and the N-PAZ lobe do not increase the binding affinity of DmAgo1 and DmAgo2 with the miRNA or siRNA but do stabilize binding to the target RNA. Interestingly, using a tethered reporter assay, the PAZ variants of DmAgo1 are still able to induce gene silencing. Moreover, deletion of the N-PAZ domains from either DmAgo1 or DmAgo2 results in constitutive activation of slicer activity in vitro. Protein expression and purification from Escherichia coli was performed as previously described (11Djuranovic S. Zinchenko M.K. Hur J.K. Nahvi A. Brunelle J.L. Rogers E.J. Green R.

Drosophila melanogaster Argonaute variants were prepared by PCR from full-length clones of DmAgo1 (gi: 17647145) and DmAgo2 (gi: 24664664) as described (11Djuranovic S. Zinchenko M.K. Hur J.K.

DmAgo1-PAZ6 and DmAgo1-YK were created by using QuikChange (Stratagene) to make the following mutations: DmAgo1-PAZ6 (R352A,K353A,Y354A,T412A,Y413A,L414A) and DmAgo1-YK (Y619L,K623E) (11Djuranovic S.

Following protein purification, repeated passages over a size exclusion matrix decreased the amount of co-purifying nucleic acid (as assessed by the loss in A260 relative to A280) (21Wang B. Li S.

Biol. 2009; 16: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Bantam miRNA (23 nt) and shorter fragments (5 and 15 nt) were chemically synthesized (Dharmacon). Radiolabeled bantam was prepared using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the chemically synthesized RNA oligonucleotide. Radioactively labeled RNA was PAGE-purified, eluted with 300 mm NaOAc (pH 5.2), and EtOH-precipitated. For analysis of RNA extracted from immunoprecipitates, we treated the RNA samples with calf intestinal phosphatase and then radiolabeled at the 5′ end with PNK and visualized reaction products on 15% denaturing PAGE. Target RNA sequences were derived from 3′-UTR of HLHmΔ gene encompassing one bantam binding site. The RNAs were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase and DNA templates with a T7 promoter (IDT DNA) (22Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Synthesis of small RNAs using T7 RNA polymerase.Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Following transcription, target RNAs were PAGE-purified and 3′ end labeled with T4 RNA ligase (Promega) and [32P]cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate, and PAGE-purified again. The Bantam miRNA (dme-bantam-3p, MIMAT0000365) are: 23 nt, UGAGAUCAUUUUGAAAGCUGAUU; 15 nt, UGAGAUCAUUUUGAA; and 5 nt, UGAGA.

The 43-nt target RNA sequences were: perfect match, AGTTCTTAAGAATCAGCTTTCAAAATGATCTCACATAGGCTTA; 1–12 match, AGTTCTTAAGTTAGTCGAAACAAAATGATCTCACATAGGCTTA; 1–13 match, AGTTCTTAAGTTAGTCGAATCAAAATGATCTCACATAGGCTTA; 1–14 match, AGTTCTTAAGTTAGTCGATTCAAAATGATCTCACATAGGCTTA; 1–15 match, AGTTCTTAAGTTAGTCGTTTCAAAATGATCTCACATAGGCTTA; 1–16 match, AGTTCTTAAGTTAGTCCTTTCAAAATGATCTCACATAGGCTTA; 1–17 match, AGTTCTTAAGTTAGTGCTTTCAAAATGATCTCACATAGGCTTA; 1–18 match, AGTTCTTAAGTTAGAGCTTTCAAAATGATCTCACATAGGCTTA; and 1–19 match, AGTTCTTAAGTTACAGCTTTCAAAATGATCTCACATAGGCTTA. The RNA primer for RNase protection analysis of RNA co-purified with DmAgo1 and variants was AGTTCTTAAGAATCAGCTTTCAAAATGATCTCACATAGGCTTA. The primers for quantitative RT-PCR in tethering assay were: firefly luciferase forward, 5′-CCAGGGATTTCAGTCGATGT-3′; firefly luciferase reverse, 5′-AATCTCACGCAGGCAGTTCT-3′; Renilla luciferase forward, 5′-GGTATGGGCAAATCAGGC-3′; and Renilla luciferase forward, 5′-GCACCCCAATCATGGCCG-3′. The assay was performed as previously described (11Djuranovic S. Zinchenko M.K. Hur J.K. Nahvi A. Brunelle J.L. Rogers E.J. Green R. Allosteric regulation of Argonaute proteins by miRNAs.Nat. Struct.

Application to protein-nucleic acid interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Briefly, synthetic 23-nt RNA was 5′ end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [32P]ATP. Subnanomolar concentrations of radiolabeled 23-nt RNA were premixed with unlabeled competitor RNA and then incubated with purified protein for 10 min. For double filter binding, the samples were added to a dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) with nitrocellulose and nylon membranes (top to bottom). Each membrane was dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen and quantified. Binding data from titrations with competitor RNA were fit to competition curves by Prism to estimate apparent dissociation constants (Kd values). 5′-Radiolabeled 23-nt RNA was preincubated with Argonaute variant proteins to form ribonucleoprotein complexes in 25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 5 mm DTT. RNase T1 (0.2 unit/ml; Fermentas) was then added, and the mix was incubated for 1 min, resulting in a partial digest. The reaction was stopped by adding yeast RNA (final concentration, 0.5 mg/μl) and GMP (final concentration, 10 mm) and was followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. The isolated RNA was resolved by denaturing PAGE, and the gel was exposed to a phosphorimaging screen and quantified. S2 cell cultures were grown in Express Five SFM medium (Invitrogen) with supplements: 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Cambrex BioScience) and 45 ml/500 ml l-glutamine (200 mm, Invitrogen). Transfections were performed with Effectene (Qiagen) for luciferase and immunoprecipitation assays. For immunoprecipitation, transfection of 4 μg of plamids encoding FLAG-tagged DmAgo1 wild type and variants were performed in 15-cm plates. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and spun in 50-ml conical tubes at 150 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed once with PBS and resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KOAc, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor EDTA-free) for lysis. The lysates were clarified by spinning at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cleared lysate was incubated with prewashed anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) and then rotated in the cold room for 15 min. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT) and eluted with 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) for analysis of protein and RNA content. Western blot analyses of FLAG-tagged proteins were performed using HRP-conjugated antibody against FLAG (Sigma). For GW182, we used rabbit anti-GW182 primary antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Promega). GFP-tagged GW182 was detected using a primary antibody against GFP (JL-8; Living Colors, Clonetech; batch no. 632381) and secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog no. 115-035-206). For detection of small RNAs that co-purified with Argonaute proteins, we extracted RNAs from the IP, removed the 5′ phosphate with calf intestinal phosphatase, and radiolabeled with polynucleotide kinase and [32P]ATP. To detect partially degraded bantam miRNA species in the co-purified RNAs, we also performed RNase protection assays using the mirVANA miRNA detection kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. The extracted RNA was hybridized overnight at 16 °C in hybridization buffer with radioactively body-labeled target RNA (43 nt) containing a perfectly complementary bantam binding site. The RNA was then treated with RNase A/T1, phenol-chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. The pellet was resuspended in loading dye, resolved on denaturing PAGE, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. The assays were conducted as described (11Djuranovic S. Zinchenko M.K. Hur J.K. Nahvi A. Brunelle J.L. Rogers E.J. Green R. Allosteric regulation of Argonaute proteins by miRNAs.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). S2 cells were co-transfected with DmAgo1 variants or GW182 fused with amino acids 1–22 of bacteriophage lambda N protein, and a luciferase reporter containing five BoxB elements in the 3′-UTR. Transfections were performed in 24-well plates with 5 ng of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, 5 ng of Renilla luciferase control plasmid and 200 ng of plasmid coding for DmAgo1 variants or GW182 with N-terminal fusion. For normalization, control experiments were conducted by co-expression of a nonfused form of each effector protein. After 48 h, luciferase levels were measured using the dual luciferase luminometer detection reagents (Promega), and mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. The assays were conducted as previously described (20Miyoshi K. Uejima H. Nagami-Okada T. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. In vitro RNA cleavage assay for Argonaute-family proteins.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 442: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recombinant DmAgo1 or DmAgo2 variants (500 nm) were incubated with bantam miRNA (1 mm) in cleavage buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2) and then added to radiolabeled target RNAs ([32P]cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate-labeled at the 3′ end). After cleavage (time course or fixed time of 1 h), the reactions were stopped by adding 2× formamide loading buffer and resolved on denaturing PAGE. Interested in the relationship between RNA binding by the Argonaute PAZ domain and distinct downstream functions, we focused on the Drosophila Argonaute proteins, DmAgo1 and DmAgo2, implicated in miRNA-mediated gene silencing and RNAi, respectively (24Förstemann K. Horwich M.D. Wee L. Tomari Y. Zamore P.D. Drosophila microRNAs are sorted into functionally distinct argonaute complexes after production by dicer-1.Cell. 2007; 130: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We purified a collection of recombinant MBP-tagged Argonautes expressed in E. coli that included: full-length WT, a mutant in the 3′ RNA binding site (PAZ6), and N-terminal and PAZ domains deleted (ΔN-PAZ) (11Djuranovic S. Zinchenko M.K. Hur J.K. Nahvi A. Brunelle J.L. Rogers E.J. Green R. Allosteric regulation of Argonaute proteins by miRNAs.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Eulalio A. Helms S. Fritzsch C. Fauser M. Izaurralde E. A C-terminal silencing domain in GW182 is essential for miRNA function.RNA. 2009; 15: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B and data not shown). To assess the impact of mutation of the PAZ domain on binding affinity of the Argonaute proteins to small RNA, we carried out filter binding assays with purified Argonuate proteins and radiolabeled bantam miRNA 23 nt in length by standard procedures (23Wong I. Lohman T.M. A double-filter method for nitrocellulose-filter binding. Application to protein-nucleic acid interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar); importantly, DmAgo1-bound miRNAs were not degraded during the time course of the experiment (data not shown). To quantify the strength of the protein-RNA interaction, we conducted competitive binding assays by titration of unlabeled homologous competitor RNA and estimated the binding affinity of DmAgo1 for the bantam miRNA as 2.9 ± 0.3 nm (Fig. 1C). We were surprised to observe that the DmAgo1-PAZ6 and DmAgo1-ΔN-PAZ variants exhibited equivalent binding affinities relative to the wild type (2.3 ± 1.1 and 2.7 ± 1.1 nm, respectively) (Fig. 1D). We also investigated DmAgo2 binding to guide RNA and the effects of an equivalent deletion. DmAgo2 exhibited a somewhat higher dissociation constant (10.7 ± 1.0 nm) in binding guide RNA compared with DmAgo1, but deletion of the N-terminal lobe again had no effect on binding (9.5 ± 1.3 nm) (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that, in vitro, the interactions between the 3′ end of the miRNA and the PAZ domain make no substantial contribution to the overall equilibrium binding constants of Argonautes with their small RNAs. Because DmAgo1 associates with miRNAs ∼21–23 nt in length in vivo and we previously documented length specific affinity (11Djuranovic S. Zinchenko M.K. Hur J.K. Nahvi A. Brunelle J.L. Rogers E.J. Green R. Allosteric regulation of Argonaute proteins by miRNAs.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we further examined whether the PAZ domain contributes to binding affinities for certain length substrates. In this case, we compared DmAgo1 wild type and the PAZ variant proteins in competition binding assays with radiolabeled bantam miRNA and competitor (unlabeled) RNAs of length 5, 15, and 23 nt (Fig. 1E). Based on known structural features, we suspected that the smaller RNAs would anchor their 5′ ends in the MID domain of the Argonaute protein but would fail to engage the PAZ domain. Therefore, if the interaction of the PAZ domain with the 3′ end of the guide RNA is important for binding, only the wild type protein might exhibit a preference for the full-length RNA. Contrary to these expectations, the full-length and PAZ variants exhibited binding patterns very similar to one another, indicating that, in vitro, PAZ domain interactions with the 3′ end do not confer length specificity on Argonuate RNA binding (Fig. 1E). Although our data indicated that the N-terminal and PAZ domains fail to make substantial contributions to binding affinity, structural studies have indicated that the guide RNA 3′ end is anchored by the PAZ domain (Fig. 2A) (6Wang Y. Sheng G. Juranek S. Tuschl T. Patel D.J. Structure of the guide-strand-containing argonaute silencing complex.Nature. 2008; 456: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To validate that guide RNAs bind in the predicted conformation and to probe the role of the PAZ domain in interactions with the 3′ end of the guide RNA, we used RNase protection assays to ask whether the PAZ domain protects bound guide RNA from nuclease attack. For these experiments, we preincubated 5′ end-labeled bantam miRNA (23 nt) with DmAgo1 wild type and PAZ variants and treated the complexes with RNase T1 for partial RNA digestion. Because RNase T1 specifically cleaves at the 3′ side of guanosine residues, cleaved bantam yielded five distinct products (Fig. 2B). In this assay, the unprotected digestion reaction (without protein) resulted in the accumulation of completely digested products, whereas protection by DmAgo1 wild type or PAZ mutants resulted in greater amounts of uncleaved or partially cleaved RNA (Fig. 2C). Examining the partial cleavage products of RNase T1, DmAgo1 wild type and the DmAgo1-PAZ6 variant showed equivalent protection of bantam miRNA at all positions, whereas the DmAgo1-ΔN-PAZ variant showed increased levels of cleavage at positions 20, 17, and 13 nt, but not at 4 nt. These data indicate that an Argonaute protein missing the N-terminal lobe can still protect the 5′ end of guide RNA, but not the 3′ end (Fig. 2C). Similar experiments using RNase A yielded equivalent results (data not shown). Given the accumulated in vitro observations regarding the behavior of the PAZ variant Argonautes (that small RNA binding is not compromised in these variants but that the 3′ end of the bound RNA is vulnerable to endonucleolytic cleavage), we hypothesized that in cells, these PAZ variants might be bound to RNA of some sort. More specifically, we speculated either that truncated miRNAs or other nonspecific cellular RNAs might be found in place of full-length canonical miRNA. To explore this possibility, we examined the small RNA species associated with DmAgo1 and its variants in cell culture. We expressed FLAG-tagged DmAgo1 variants in S2 cells and directly analyzed the RNA that co-immunoprecipitated (co-IPed) with the tagged proteins. Northern blot analyses of the RNAs with probes to bantam revealed full-length 23-nt bantam associated with DmAgo1 but not with either PAZ domain mutant (Fig. 3A). Moreover, we could not detect any truncated forms of bantam using this assay consistent with earlier studies (13Eulalio A. Helms S. Fritzsch C. Fauser M. Izaurralde E. A C-terminal silencing domain in GW182 is essential for miRNA function.RNA. 2009; 15: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To detect with higher sensitivity shorter RNAs that are possibly associated with Argonaute proteins in the cell, we performed 5′ end radioactive labeling of RNAs isolated from immunoprecipitated DmAgo1 wild type and PAZ variants and resolved them by denaturing PAGE (Fig. 3B). We observed association of ∼21–23-nucleotide-long RNAs only with DmAgo1 wild type, whereas smaller RNA species (15–17 nt) co-purified with wild type and PAZ variants, albeit to a lesser extent with the variants. Next, to more sensitively probe for bantam miRNA, we performed an RNase protection assay where the same extracted RNA was hybridized directly with anti-bantam body labeled probes (43 nt). The hybridized samples were treated with single-stranded RNA specific RNase, and the remaining regions of probes that hybridized to bantam (full-length or truncated) were resolved by PAGE. We observed that RNAs from the IP of DmAgo1 wild type contained full-length as well as partially degraded bantam miRNA, whereas the PAZ6 and ΔN-PAZ variants co-IPed only with partially degraded bantam miRNA, again to a lesser extent than wild type (Fig. 3C). Importantly, no bantam (either full-length or truncated) could be detected bound to the previously characterized 5′-miRNA binding site mutant (DmAgo1-YK) (11Djuranovic S. Zinchenko M.K. Hur J.K.

https://openalex.org/W2061848410,"Quinolone alkaloids, found abundantly in the roots of bael (Aegle marmelos), possess various biological activities and have recently gained attention as potential lead molecules for novel drug designing. Here, we report the characterization of a novel Type III polyketide synthase, quinolone synthase (QNS), from A. marmelos that is involved in the biosynthesis of quinolone alkaloid. Using homology-based structural modeling, we identify two crucial amino acid residues (Ser-132 and Ala-133) at the putative QNS active site. Substitution of Ser-132 to Thr and Ala-133 to Ser apparently constricted the active site cavity resulting in production of naringenin chalcone from p-coumaroyl-CoA. Measurement of steady-state kinetic parameters demonstrates that the catalytic efficiency of QNS was severalfold higher for larger acyl-coenzymeA substrates as compared with smaller precursors. Our mutagenic studies suggest that this protein might have evolved from an evolutionarily related member of chalcone synthase superfamily by mere substitution of two active site residues. The identification and characterization of QNS offers a promising target for gene manipulation studies toward the production of novel alkaloid scaffolds."

The carboxyl terminus of highly Ca(2+)-permeable CNGA3 expressed in the mammalian organ of Corti and saccular hair cells was found to interact with an intracellular domain of microfibril interface-located protein 1 (EMILIN 1), a member of the elastin superfamily, also immunolocalizd to hair cell stereocilia (Selvakumar, D., Drescher, M. J., Dowdall, J. R., Khan, K. M., Hatfield, J. S., Ramakrishnan, N. A., and Drescher, D. G. (2012) Biochem. J. 443, 463-476). Here, we provide evidence for organ of Corti proteins, of Ca(2+)-dependent binding of the amino terminus of CNGA3 specifically to the carboxyl terminus of stereocilia tip-link protein CDH23 +68 (cadherin 23 with expressed exon 68) by yeast two-hybrid mating and co-transformation protocols, pulldown assays, and surface plasmon resonance analysis. Myosin VIIa, required for adaptation of hair cell mechanotransduction (MET) channel(s), competed with CDH23 +68, with direct Ca(2+)-dependent binding to the amino terminus of CNGA3. Based upon the premise that hair cell stereocilia tip-link proteins are closely coupled with MET, these results are consistent with the possibility that CNGA3 participates in hair-cell MET. Together with the demonstration of protein-protein interaction between HCN1 and tip-link protein protocadherin 15 CD3 (Ramakrishnan, N. A., Drescher, M. J., Barretto, R. L., Beisel, K.

Chem. 287, 37628-37646), a protein-protein interaction for CNGA3 and a second tip-link protein, CDH23 +68, further suggests possible association of two different channels with a single stereocilia tip link."
https://openalex.org/W2058081991,"The human POZ domain and Krüppel-like zinc finger (POK) family proteins play important roles in the regulation of apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation, development, oncogenesis, and tumor suppression. A novel POK family transcription factor, BTB/POZ and zinc finger domains factor on chromosome 1 (BOZF-1; also called ZBTB8A), contains a POZ domain and two C2H2-type Krüppel-like zinc fingers and is localized at nuclear speckles. Compared with paired normal tissues, BOZF1 expression is increased in cancer tissues of the prostate, breast, and cervix. BOZF1 repressed the transcription of p21WAF/CDKN1A by acting on the proximal promoter concentrated with Sp1-binding GC boxes. BOZF1 competed with Sp1 in binding to GC boxes 1-5/6 of the CDKN1A proximal promoter. In addition, BOZF1 interacted with p53 and decreased the acetylation of p53 by p300, which reduced the DNA binding activity of p53 at the far distal p53-binding element. BOZF1 blocked the two major molecular events that are important in both constitutive and inducible transcription activation of CDKN1A. BOZF1 is unique in that it bound to all the proximal GC boxes to repress transcription, and it inhibited p53 acetylation without affecting p53 stability. BOZF1 might be a novel proto-oncoprotein that stimulates cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1969399733,"Integrin-linked kinase-associated phosphatase (ILKAP) is a serine/threonine (S/T) phosphatase that belongs to the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) family. Many previous studies have demonstrated that ILKAP plays key roles in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis. Researchers have thus far considered ILKAP a cytoplasmic protein that negatively regulates integrin signaling by interacting with and phosphorylating integrin-linked kinase 1 (ILK1). In this study, we found that both endogenous and tagged ILKAP mainly localize to the nucleus and that the nuclear transport of ILKAP is nuclear localization signal (NLS) importin-mediated. The ILKAP protein interacts directly with importin α1, α3, and α5. The NLS in ILKAP is located in the N-terminal region between amino acids 71 and 86, and the NLS-deleted ILKAP protein was distributed in the cytoplasm. In addition, we show that Lys-78 and Arg-79 are critical for the binding of ILKAP to importin α. We also found that nuclear ILKAP interacts with ribosomal protein S6 kinase-2 (RSK2) and induces apoptosis by inhibiting RSK2 activity and down-regulating the expression level of the RSK2 downstream substrate cyclin D1. These results indicate that ILKAP is a nuclear protein that regulates cell survival and apoptosis through the regulation of RSK2 signaling."
