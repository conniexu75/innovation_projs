Myrica quadruples the amount of nitrogen entering certain sites and increases the overall biological availability of nitrogen, thereby altering the nature of ecosystem development after volcanic eruptions."
https://openalex.org/W1990413373,"A novel application of x-ray absorption spectroscopy has provided structural information for ions sorbed at oxide-water interfaces. As an example, in situ extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements of adsorbed selenate and selenite ions at ah alpha-FeOOH(goethite)-water interface have been performed; these measurements show that selenate forms a weakly bonded, outer-sphere complex and that selenite forms a strongly bonded, inner-sphere complex. The selenite ion is bonded directly to the goethite surface in a bidentate fashion with two iron atoms 3.38 angstroms from the selenium atom. Adsorbed selenate has no iron atom in the second coordination shell of selenium, which indicates retention of its hydration sphere upon sorption. This method provides direct structural information for adsorbed species at solid-liquid interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2038608121,"Tissue culture-derived plants of many species have often been observed to possess both genetic and cytogenetic abnormalities. A high frequency of structurally altered chromosomes in maize (Zea mays L.) plants regenerated from tissue culture led to the prediction that newly activated transposable elements could be detected in regenerated plants. Testcrosses of 1200 progeny from 301 regenerated maize plants confirmed that ten regenerated plants from two independent embryo cell lines contained an active Actransposable element. No active Ac elements were present in the explant sources. Recovery of transposable element activity in regenerated plants indicates that some tissue culture-derived genetic variability may be the result of insertion or excision of transposable elements, or both."

Maps of historical changes to the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field show indirect impacts can lag behind planned developments by many years and the total area eventually disturbed can greatly exceed the planned area of construction. For example, in the wettest parts of the oil field (flat thaw-lake plains), flooding and thermokarst covered more than twice the area directly affected by roads and other construction activities. Protecting critical wildlife habitat is the central issue for cumulative impact analysis in northern Alaska. Comprehensive landscape planning with the use of geographic information system technology and detailed geobotanical maps can help identify and protect areas of high wildlife use."
https://openalex.org/W2019160258,"The stable rotation and sharp radio pulses of PSR 1937+21 make this pulsar a clock whose long-term frequency stability approaches and may exceed that of the best atomic clocks. Improvements in measurement techniques now permit pulse arrival times to be determined in 1 hour at the Arecibo radio telescope with uncertainties of about 300 nanoseconds relative to atomic time. Measurements taken approximately every 2 weeks since November 1982 yield estimates of fractional frequency stability that continue to improve with increasing averaging time. The pulsar's frequency stability is at least as good as 6 x 10(-14) for averaging times longer than 4 months, and over the longest intervals the measurements appear to be limited by the stability of the reference atomic docks. The data yield a firm upper limit of 7 x 10(-36) gram per cubic centimeter for the energy density of a cosmic background of gravitational radiation at frequencies of about 0.23 cycle per year. This limit corresponds to approximately 4 x 10(-7) of the density required to close the universe."
https://openalex.org/W2024944062,"The transition from body-centered cubic to hexagonal close-packed phase in iron has been studied in a diamond anvil cell with synchrotron radiation. The hexagonal close-packed phase, when it first appears, has a ratio of lattice parameters that is significantly larger than normal. This is attributed to a displacive mechanism that causes a distortion of the hexagonal close-packed structure in a body-centered cubic matrix. The hexagonal close-packed phase adjacent to a boundary with the body-centered cubic phase is stretched in the c direction and compressed in the a direction when it first forms."

Recently I have repeated the experiment with the purpose of improving the technique and confirming the results."

https://openalex.org/W4206639673,"A recent article by William Booth on the President's AIDS commission (News & Comment, 16 Oct., p. 262) incorrectly states that commission member Cory SerVaas, publisher of the Saturday Evening Post, drives her AIDS Mobile around the country. SerVaas does not drive the traveling van that offers free AIDS testing. Rather, she often flies to meet it as it travels around the country, stopping at shopping malls and churches by prearrangement with local civic and religious groups. SerVaas denies saying that homosexuals are ""deviants."" ""We have helped homosexuals for many years,"" she says, pointing out that although her group primarily tests people who have a low risk of being infected, such as recipients of blood transfusions and women who may become pregnant, members of high-risk groups such as homosexuals and drug addicts are not excluded."
