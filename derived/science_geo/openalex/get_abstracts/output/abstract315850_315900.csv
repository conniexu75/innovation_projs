https://openalex.org/W2042900638,"A p-n junction diode of cubic boron nitride was made by growing an n-type crystal epitaxially on a p-type seed crystal at a pressure of 55 kilobars and a temperature of about 1700 degrees C. A temperature-difference solvent method was used for the crystal growth, and beryllium and silicon were doped as acceptors and donors, respectively. Formation of the p-n junction was clearly confirmed at 1 bar by rectification characteristics and by existence of a space charge layer of the junction as observed by electron beam induced current measurement. This diode operated at 530 degrees C."

DNA isolated from extracts of insects infected with the Western X-disease MLO was cloned in Escherichia coli. X-disease-specific clones, when labeled and used as probes, readily detected X-disease MLOs in infected plants and insects but did not hybridize with DNA from healthy plants or insects, or from several other plant pathogenic MLOs or spiroplasmas. These methods provide both a sensitive diagnostic tool and a basis for genetically differentiating MLOs."

Ba(I(3))(2) . 22H(2)O, the maltohexaose units form an antiparallel, left-handed double helix with O-2 ... O-3 and O-6 ... O-6 hydrogen bonding and a central cavity that encloses two triiodide units. This structure contrasts with the parallel, left-handed double helix with no central cavity proposed for the A-and B-starch helix and the left-handed single helix in V-amylose and may be relevant for the stabilization of glycogen Structure."

Io, in its motion through the Io plasma torus at Jupiter, continuously generates an Alfv√©n wing that carries two billion kilowatts of power into the jovian ionosphere. Concurrently, Io is acted upon by a J x B force tending to propel it out of the jovian system. The energy source for these processes is the rotation of Jupiter. This unusual planet-satellite coupling serves as an archetype for the interaction of a large moving conductor with a magnetized plasma, a problem of general space and astrophysical interest."

The organic extract from the primitive carbonaceous chondritic Murchison meteorite shows similar spectral bands."

https://openalex.org/W205488526,"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Mirror Fusion Test Facility (MFTF-B) was built to prove that a design using magnetic mirrors could compete in an international race to produce a commercial fusion reactor. The MFTF-B was to be used to propel the magnetic mirror program into a real contest against Livermore's arch rival: the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and its tokamak machine. On 21 February 1986, after 9 years of construction and $372 million, MTFT-B was officially dedicated. However, due to budget restriction DOE demanded the facility be put on standby the very next day."
