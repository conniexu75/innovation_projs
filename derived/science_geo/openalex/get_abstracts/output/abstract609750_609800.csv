To expand the capability of CAR T cells, here, we present a split, universal, and programmable (SUPRA) CAR system that simultaneously encompasses multiple critical “upgrades,” such as the ability to switch targets without re-engineering the T cells, finely tune T cell activation strength, and sense and logically respond to multiple antigens. These features are useful to combat relapse, mitigate over-activation, and enhance specificity. We test our SUPRA system against two different tumor models to demonstrate its broad utility and humanize its components to minimize potential immunogenicity concerns. Furthermore, we extend the orthogonal SUPRA CAR system to regulate different T cell subsets independently, demonstrating a dually inducible CAR system. Together, these SUPRA CARs illustrate that multiple advanced logic and control features can be implemented into a single, integrated system.

The transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells to patients is a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy (Brentjens et al., 2011Brentjens R.J. Rivière I. Park J.H. Davila M.L.

Med. 2012; 4: 132ra53Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). To improve overall effectiveness and safety of CAR T cell therapy, there is an urgent need for a better system that can finely tune T cell activation, enhance tumor specificity, and independently control different signaling pathways and cell types. The CAR T cells used in clinical trials typically have a rigid design that is difficult to alter without re-engineering the T cells. Current CAR designs are composed of a fixed antigen-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and intracellular signaling domains (CD3ζ and costimulatory domains). When the constant antigen-specific CAR binds to the target antigen, these invariable signaling domains are activated simultaneously at a predetermined level. Due to the fixed design that limited the controllability of CAR T cell activation level, managing CAR T cell-related toxicities have proven to be challenging (Brentjens et al., 2013Brentjens R.J. Davila M.L. Riviere I. Park J. Wang X. Cowell L.G. Bartido S. Stefanski J. Taylor C.

Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 224ra25Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). In addition to constraining the controllability of CAR T cell activity, this fixed CAR design also restricts the antigen specificity and affinity. High-affinity scFvs are often used in the CAR design to ensure high antigen specificity. However, CARs made with high-affinity scFvs have limited capacity in discriminating antigen density, which has led to dangerous reactivity against healthy organs expressing a low level of antigens (Bonifant et al., 2016Bonifant C.L.

Using a scFv with lower antigen affinity allowed better antigen density discrimination (Caruso et al., 2015Caruso H.G. Hurton L.V. Najjar A. Rushworth D. Ang S. Olivares S. Mi T. Switzer K. Singh H.

Thus, modulation of CAR components other than scFv affinity may be needed for improving CAR T cell specificity. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the importance of regulating CD3ζ and the different costimulatory pathways independently to achieve optimal T cell response (Kloss et al., 2013Kloss C.C.

Also, the activation of different costimulatory domains (e.g., CD28 or 4-1BB) is known to have different T cell functions and phenotypes (e.g., T cell differentiation, memory T cell formation) (Kawalekar et al., 2016Kawalekar O.U.

CD137 stimulation delivers an antigen-independent growth signal for T lymphocytes with memory phenotype.Blood. 2007; 109: 4882-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), demonstrating the value of CAR design that allows independent control of different signaling domains. The composition of the T cell subsets, such as the ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, has also been shown to be an important parameter for enhancing the antitumor response of CAR T cells (Turtle et al., 2016Turtle C.J. Hanafi L.A. Berger C. Gooley T.A. Cherian S. Hudecek M. Sommermeyer D. Melville K. Pender B. Budiarto T.M. et al.CD19 CAR-T cells of defined CD4+:CD8+ composition in adult B cell ALL patients.J. Clin. Invest. 2016; 126: 2123-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Given the fact that our immune system is composed of many different T cell subtypes with distinct effector functions (Golubovskaya and Wu, 2016Golubovskaya V. Wu L. Different Subsets of T Cells, Memory, Effector Functions, and CAR-T Immunotherapy.Cancers (Basel). 2016; 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, Vignali et al., 2008Vignali D.A. Collison L.W.

Functions of natural killer cells.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar), regulating the activity of T cell subtypes independently may be an attractive strategy for optimizing the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy (Sadelain et al., 2017Sadelain M. Rivière I. Riddell S. Therapeutic T cell engineering.Nature. 2017; 545: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, current fixed CAR design limits independent and inducible activation of different signaling domains or different T cell subsets to achieve user-defined diverse T cell response. New receptor designs have been developed to address some of the deficiencies (e.g., controllability, flexibility, specificity) in current CAR T cell therapies. For instance, drug-inducible ON and kill switches have been developed to regulate CAR activity (Di Stasi et al., 2011Di Stasi A. Tey S.-K. Dotti G. Fujita Y. Kennedy-Nasser A. Martinez C. Straathof K. Liu E. Durett A.G. Grilley B. et al.Inducible apoptosis as a safety switch for adoptive cell therapy.N. Engl. J.

Remote control of therapeutic T cells through a small molecule-gated chimeric receptor.Science. 2015; 350: aab4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Also, to afford greater flexibility in antigen recognition, CARs have been split such that the antigen recognition motif is dissociated from the signaling motif of the CAR. This split CAR configuration uses a universal receptor as the common basis for all interactions, allowing a large panel of antigens to be targeted without re-engineering the immune cells (Cartellieri et al., 2016Cartellieri M.

In addition, to increase tumor specificity, CARs were developed that allow combinatorial antigen sensing (Kloss et al., 2013Kloss C.C. Condomines M. Cartellieri M. Bachmann M. Sadelain M.

T Cells Expressing CD19/CD20 Bispecific Chimeric Antigen Receptors Prevent Antigen Escape by Malignant B Cells.Cancer Immunol. Res. 2016; 4: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). All of these features are arguably vital to ensure a safe and effective CAR T therapy. However, none of these advanced CARs has incorporated all of these features into one system. Additionally, the signaling pathways and cell types that can be activated are also fixed, thus limiting the diverse immune responses that can be achieved. To enhance the specificity, safety, and programmability of CARs, we develop a split, universal, and programmable (SUPRA) CAR system composed of a universal receptor expressed on T cells and a tumor-targeting scFv adaptor molecule (Figure 1A). The activity of SUPRA CARs can be finely regulated via multiple mechanisms to limit overactivation. SUPRA CARs can also logically respond to multiple antigens for improving tumor specificity. We show that the SUPRA CAR system is effective against two different tumor models, demonstrating the broad clinical potential of this system. In addition, we show that SUPRA components can be humanized to reduce potential immunogenicity. Furthermore, we use orthogonal SUPRA CARs to inducibly regulate multiple signaling pathways or different human T cell subtypes to increase the range of the immune responses that can be achieved. Together, the SUPRA CAR system is a feature-rich system with inducible and logical control capabilities that can improve the safety and efficacy of current cellular cancer immunotherapy. The SUPRA CAR is a two-component receptor system composed of a universal receptor (zipCAR) expressed on T cells and a tumor-targeting scFv adaptor (zipFv) (Figure 1A). The zipCAR universal receptor is generated from the fusion of intracellular signaling domains and a leucine zipper as the extracellular domain. The zipFv adaptor molecule is generated from the fusion of a cognate leucine zipper and a scFv. The scFv of the zipFv binds to the tumor antigen, and the leucine zipper binds and activates the zipCAR on the T cells (Figures S1A and S2). Unlike the conventional fixed CAR design, the SUPRA CAR modular design allows targeting of multiple antigens without further genetic manipulations of a patient’s immune cells (Figure 1B, left). To test the ability of the SUPRA CAR system targeting multiple antigens with the same batch of T cells expressing the zipCAR, we first engineered human primary CD8+ T cells to express an RR zipCAR (RR leucine zipper with CD28, 4-1BB co-stimulatory and a CD3ζ signaling domain; Figure S1A). Next, we designed three different zipFvs to target three common tumor antigens (α-Her2, α-Axl, and α-Mesothelin; Figure S1A) by fusing the corresponding scFvs to an EE leucine zipper, which binds to the RR zipCAR on T cells. The engineered CD8+ T cells were co-cultured in vitro with K562 myelogenous leukemia cells that express Her2, Axl, or Mesothelin tumor antigens. The CD8+ zipCAR T cells killed the corresponding tumor cells when the matching zipFvs were added (Figure 1B, right).Figure S2Comparison of SUPRA CAR with Conventional α-Her2 CAR and Characterization of zipFvs, Related to Figures 1Show full caption(A) (Left) Schematic of SUPRA CAR (EE-RR pair) and a-Her2 CAR.

(F) Table of expected protein mass (Da) of different zipFvs. A unique feature of the split CAR design is that it has multiple tunable variables, such as (1) the affinity between leucine zipper pairs, (2) the affinity between tumor antigen and scFv, (3) the concentration of zipFv, and (4) the expression level of zipCAR, that can be used to modulate the T cell response (Figure 1C). We first characterized the effect of zipFv concentration and zipper affinity on T cell activation. We generated three zipFvs with the same α-Her2 scFv but fused to leucine zippers (SYN5, SYN 3, and EE) that have different affinity to the RR zipCAR (Reinke et al., 2010Reinke A.W. Grant R.A. Keating A.E. A synthetic coiled-coil interactome provides heterospecific modules for molecular engineering.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 6025-6031Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, Thompson et al., 2012Thompson K.E. Bashor C.J. Lim W.A. Keating A.E. SYNZIP protein interaction toolbox: in vitro and in vivo specifications of heterospecific coiled-coil interaction domains.ACS Synth. Biol. 2012; 1: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The amount of zipFv required to activate T cells to half-maximal interferon (IFN)-γ secretion and cytotoxicity inversely correlated with the affinity of leucine zipper pairs where α-Her2-EE zipFv showed the lowest EC50 and α-Her2-SYN5 zipFv showed the highest EC50 value (Figures 1D and S1C). Also, the maximum level of IFN-γ secretion or killing efficiency correlated with the affinity of leucine zipper pairs. We next investigated the effect of scFv-tumor antigen affinity, leucine zipper affinity, and zipCAR expression levels on the IFN-γ secretion and cancer-killing efficiency by the SUPRA CAR T cells (Figures 1E and S1D). We created 12 different zipFvs (three different leucine zippers with different affinity and four scFvs against Her2 [G98, C65, ML39, and H3B1] with Kd ranging from 3.2 × 10−7 to 1.2 × 10−10 M) (Chmielewski et al., 2004Chmielewski M. Hombach A. Heuser C. Adams G.P. Abken H. T cell activation by antibody-like immunoreceptors: increase in affinity of the single-chain fragment domain above threshold does not increase T cell activation against antigen-positive target cells but decreases selectivity.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7647-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We also generated two batches of T cells with high or low RR zipCAR expression level using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figure S1B). Cells expressing higher levels of zipCAR exhibited greater cytokine secretion when activated (Figure 1E). The affinity of scFv to Her2 correlated weakly with cytokine secretion or target cell lysis (Chmielewski et al., 2004Chmielewski M. Hombach A. Heuser C. Adams G.P. Abken H. T cell activation by antibody-like immunoreceptors: increase in affinity of the single-chain fragment domain above threshold does not increase T cell activation against antigen-positive target cells but decreases selectivity.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7647-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The affinity between leucine zippers, however, correlated well with cellular activation regarding cancer cell killing efficiency and cytokine secretion. As high-affinity scFv CARs often over-activate and show severe toxicities in clinical trials (Bonifant et al., 2016Bonifant C.L. Jackson H.J. Brentjens R.J. Curran K.J. Toxicity and management in CAR T-cell therapy.Mol. Ther. Oncolytics. 2016; 3: 16011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, Brudno and Kochenderfer, 2016Brudno J.N. Kochenderfer J.N. Toxicities of chimeric antigen receptor T cells: recognition and management.Blood. 2016; 127: 3321-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), the SUPRA platform can mitigate these toxicities by controlling other factors (e.g., zipFv concentration, affinity between leucine zipper pairs) to regulate T cell activation level. Together, these results demonstrate the tunable and modular nature of the SUPRA CAR design. As many patients treated with CAR T cell therapy face cytokine release syndrome, which can be life threatening (Maude et al., 2014bMaude S.L. Barrett D. Teachey D.T. Grupp S.A. Managing cytokine release syndrome associated with novel T cell-engaging therapies.Cancer J. 2014; 20: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, Morgan et al., 2010Morgan R.A. Yang J.C.

Ther. 2010; 18: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar), it is important to prevent CAR T cell activity when necessary. Thus, we explored the possibility of inhibiting the SUPRA CAR T cell activation through the addition of a competitive zipFv that can bind to the other zipFv, thus preventing zipCAR from being activated (Figure 2A, left). To test this approach, we screened several competitive zipFvs with different affinities for the EE zipFv (strong, medium, and weak) (Figures S3B and S3C). Human CD8+ T cells were transduced with RR zipCAR and co-cultured with Her2+ K562 cells. Then, EE zipFv (22.5 nM, red) was subsequently added to activate the T cells. Without the competitive zipFv, the EE zipFv alone could activate T cells to destroy Her2+ cancer cells (Figure 2A, right). However, when the competitive zipFv (SYN4, SYN 47, or SYN 13) was also introduced (90 nM, green), it bound to the EE zipFv and prevented the EE zipFv from activating the zipCAR T cells. By utilizing this competitive approach, we were able to inhibit primary CD8+ T cell activation in vitro with the strong competitive zipFv (SYN4). Furthermore, we were able to tune the activation levels with weaker binding zippers (SYN 47 and SYN 13). To understand inhibition dynamics, we varied the amount of competitive zipFv and timing of its addition. Increasing the amount of competitive zipFv or delaying competitive zipFv addition did not affect inhibition strength greatly (Figure S3D).Figure S3Competitive zipFv Screen to Tune SUPRA CAR Activity and Using SUPRA as a Cell Selector, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Leucine zippers with different affinities to EE leucine zipper.(B) EE zipCAR expressing Jurkat T cells were co-cultured with Her2 expressing K562.

https://openalex.org/W2799839529,"Bats harbor many viruses asymptomatically, including several notorious for causing extreme virulence in humans. To identify differences between antiviral mechanisms in humans and bats, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the genome of Rousettus aegyptiacus, a natural reservoir of Marburg virus and the only known reservoir for any filovirus. We found an expanded and diversified KLRC/KLRD family of natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, which dramatically differ from their functional counterparts in other mammals. Such concerted evolution of key components of bat immunity is strongly suggestive of novel modes of antiviral defense. An evaluation of the theoretical function of these genes suggests that an inhibitory immune state may exist in bats. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that tolerance of viral infection, rather than enhanced potency of antiviral defenses, may be a key mechanism by which bats asymptomatically host viruses that are pathogenic in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2784117065,"Massive amounts of fake news and conspiratorial content have spread over social media before and after the 2016 US Presidential Elections despite intense fact-checking efforts. How do the spread of misinformation and fact-checking compete? What are the structural and dynamic characteristics of the core of the misinformation diffusion network, and who are its main purveyors? How to reduce the overall amount of misinformation? To explore these questions we built Hoaxy, an open platform that enables large-scale, systematic studies of how misinformation and fact-checking spread and compete on Twitter. Hoaxy captures public tweets that include links to articles from low-credibility and fact-checking sources. We perform k-core decomposition on a diffusion network obtained from two million retweets produced by several hundred thousand accounts over the six months before the election. As we move from the periphery to the core of the network, fact-checking nearly disappears, while social bots proliferate. The number of users in the main core reaches equilibrium around the time of the election, with limited churn and increasingly dense connections. We conclude by quantifying how effectively the network can be disrupted by penalizing the most central nodes. These findings provide a first look at the anatomy of a massive online misinformation diffusion network."
https://openalex.org/W2799915740,"A high-throughput plant phenotyping system automatically observes and grows many plant samples. Many plant sample images are acquired by the system to determine the characteristics of the plants (populations). Stable image acquisition and processing is very important to accurately determine the characteristics. However, hardware for acquiring plant images rapidly and stably, while minimizing plant stress, is lacking. Moreover, most software cannot adequately handle large-scale plant imaging. To address these problems, we developed a new, automated, high-throughput plant phenotyping system using simple and robust hardware, and an automated plant-imaging-analysis pipeline consisting of machine-learning-based plant segmentation. Our hardware acquires images reliably and quickly and minimizes plant stress. Furthermore, the images are processed automatically. In particular, large-scale plant-image datasets can be segmented precisely using a classifier developed using a superpixel-based machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest), and variations in plant parameters (such as area) over time can be assessed using the segmented images. We performed comparative evaluations to identify an appropriate learning algorithm for our proposed system, and tested three robust learning algorithms. We developed not only an automatic analysis pipeline but also a convenient means of plant-growth analysis that provides a learning data interface and visualization of plant growth trends. Thus, our system allows end-users such as plant biologists to analyze plant growth via large-scale plant image data easily."
https://openalex.org/W2801637111,"Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to reduce HIV acquisition among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in sub-Saharan Africa. However, health care providers' (HCPs) perspectives and interactions with potential clients can substantially influence effective provision of quality health services. We examine if HCPs' knowledge, attitude, and skills, as well as their perceptions of facility readiness to provide PrEP are associated with their willingness to provide PrEP to AGYW at high risk of HIV in Tanzania.A self-administered questionnaire was given to 316 HCPs from 74 clinics in two districts and 24 HCPs participated in follow-up in-depth interviews (IDIs). We conducted bivariate and multivariable Poisson regression to assess factors associated with willingness to provide PrEP to AGYW. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the IDIs, which expanded upon the quantitative results.Few HCPs (3.5%) had prior PrEP knowledge, but once informed, 61.1% were willing to prescribe PrEP to AGYW. Higher negative attitudes toward adolescent sexuality and greater concerns about behavioral disinhibition due to PrEP use were associated with lower willingness to prescribe PrEP. Qualitatively, HCPs acknowledged that biases, rooted in cultural norms, often result in stigmatizing and discriminatory care toward AGYW, a potential barrier for PrEP provision. However, better training to provide HIV services was associated with greater willingness to prescribe PrEP. Conversely, HCPs feared the potential negative impact of PrEP on the provision of existing HIV services (e.g., overburdened staff), and suggested the integration of PrEP into non-HIV services and the use of paramedical professionals to facilitate PrEP provision.Preparing for PrEP introduction requires more than solely training HCPs on the clinical aspects of providing PrEP. It requires a two-pronged strategy: addressing HCPs' biases regarding sexual health services to AGYW; and preparing the health system infrastructure for the introduction of PrEP."
https://openalex.org/W2800672823,"Mutations in the Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Recently we have generated Cdkl5 KO mice by targeting exon 2 on the C57BL/6N background, and demonstrated postsynaptic overaccumulation of GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus. In the current study, we subjected the Cdkl5 KO mice to a battery of comprehensive behavioral tests, aiming to reveal the effects of loss of CDKL5 in a whole perspective of motor, emotional, social, and cognition/memory functions, and to identify its undetermined roles. The neurological screen, rotarod, hot plate, prepulse inhibition, light/dark transition, open field, elevated plus maze, Porsolt forced swim, tail suspension, one-chamber and three-chamber social interaction, 24-h home cage monitoring, contextual and cued fear conditioning, Barnes maze, and T-maze tests were applied on adult Cdkl5 -/Y and +/Y mice. Cdkl5 -/Y mice showed a mild alteration in the gait. Analyses of emotional behaviors revealed significantly enhanced anxiety-like behaviors of Cdkl5 -/Y mice. Depressive-like behaviors and social interaction of Cdkl5 -/Y mice were uniquely altered. The contextual and cued fear conditioning of Cdkl5 -/Y mice were comparable to control mice; however, Cdkl5 -/Y mice showed a significantly increased freezing time and a significantly decreased distance traveled during the pretone period in the altered context. Both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory were significantly impaired. The morphometric analysis of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed impaired dendritic arborization and immature spine development in Cdkl5 -/Y mice. These results indicate that CDKL5 plays significant roles in regulating emotional behaviors especially on anxiety- and fear-related responses, and in both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory, which suggests that focus and special attention should be paid to the specific mechanisms of these deficits in the CDKL5 deficiency disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2802182467,"Our aims were to quantify and map the plant sub regions of the the Caatinga, that covers 844,453 km2 and is the largest block of seasonally dry forest in South America. We performed spatial analyses of the largest dataset of woody plant distributions in this region assembled to date (of 2,666 shrub and tree species; 260 localities), compared these distributions with the current phytogeographic regionalizations, and investigated the potential environmental drivers of the floristic patterns in these sub regions. Phytogeographical regions were identified using quantitative analyses of species turnover calculated as Simpson dissimilarity index. We applied an interpolation method to map NMDS axes of compositional variation over the entire extent of the Caatinga, and then classified the compositional dissimilarity according to the number of biogeographical sub regions identified a priori using k-means analysis. We used multinomial logistic regression models to investigate the influence of contemporary climatic productivity, topographic complexity, soil characteristics, climate stability since the last glacial maximum, and the human footprint in explaining the identified sub regions. We identified nine spatially cohesive biogeographical sub regions. Current productivity, as indicated by an aridity index, was the only explanatory variable retained in the best model, explaining nearly half of the floristic variability between sub regions. The highest rates of endemism within the Caatinga were in the Core and Periphery Chapada Diamantina sub regions. Our findings suggest that the topographic complexity, soil variation, and human footprint in the Caatinga act on woody plant distributions at local scales and not as determinants of broad floristic patterns. The lack of effect of climatic stability since the last glacial maximum probably results from the fact that a single measure of climatic stability does not adequately capture the highly dynamic climatic shifts the region suffered during the Pleistocene. There was limited overlap between our results and previous Caatinga classifications."
https://openalex.org/W2802365145,"Few studies have estimated the economic burden of chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers) attributable to unhealthy eating. In this study, we estimated the economic burden of chronic disease attributable to not meeting Canadian food recommendations. We first obtained chronic disease risk estimates for intakes of both protective (1. vegetables; 2. fruit; 3. whole grains; 4. milk; 5. nuts and seeds) and harmful (6. processed meat; 7. red meat; 8. sugar-sweetened beverages) foods from the Global Burden of Disease Study, and food intakes from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey 24-hour dietary recalls (n = 33,932 respondents). We then calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs) for all relevant food-chronic disease combinations by age and sex groups. These PAFs were then mathematically combined for each disease for each age and sex group. We then estimated attributable costs by multiplying these combined PAFs with estimated 2014 annual direct health care (hospital, drug, physician) and indirect (human capital approach) costs for each disease. We found that not meeting recommendations for the eight foods was responsible for CAD$13.8 billion/year (direct health care: CAD$5.1 billion, indirect: CAD$8.7 billion). Nuts and seeds and whole grains were the top cost contributors rather than vegetables and fruit. Our findings suggest that unhealthy eating constitutes a tremendous economic burden to Canada that is similar in magnitude to the burden of smoking and larger than that of physical inactivity which were estimated using similar approaches. A status quo in promotion of healthy eating will allow this burden to continue. Interventions to reduce the health and economic burden of unhealthy eating in Canada may be more effective if they are broad in focus and include promotion of nuts and seeds and whole grains along with vegetables and fruit rather than have a narrow focus such as primarily on vegetables and fruit."
https://openalex.org/W2802974127,"One of the classic approaches in environmental economics is the environmental Kuznets curve, which predicts that when a national economy grows from low to medium levels, threats to biodiversity conservation increase, but they decrease when the economy moves from medium to high. We evaluated this approach by examining how population densities of the brown bear (Ursus arctos), gray wolf (Canis lupus), and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) were related to the national economy in 24 European countries.We used forest proportions, the existence of a compensation system, and country group (former socialist countries, Nordic countries, other countries) as covariates in a linear model with the first- and the second-order polynomial terms of per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Country group was treated as a random factor, but remained insignificant and was ignored. All models concerning brown bear and wolf provided evidence that population densities decreased with increasing GDP, but densities of lynx were virtually independent of GDP. Models for the wolf explained >80% of the variation in densities, without a difference between the models with all independent variables and the model with only GDP. For the bear, the model with GDP alone accounted for 10%, and all three variables 33%, of the variation in densities.Wolves exhibit a higher capacity for dispersal and reproduction than bear or lynx, but still exists at the lowest densities in wealthy European countries. We are aware that several other factors, not available for our models, influenced large carnivore densities. Based on the pronounced differences among large carnivore species in their countrywide relationships between densities and GDP, and a strikingly high relationship for the gray wolf, we suggest that our results reflected differences in political history and public acceptance of these species among countries. The compensation paid for the damages caused by the carnivores is not a key to higher carnivore densities, but might be necessity for the presence of large carnivores to be accepted in countries with high GDP."
https://openalex.org/W2799742820,"Introduction Appropriate demand for, and supply of, high quality essential neonatal care is key to improving newborn survival but evaluating such provision has received limited attention in low- and middle-income countries. Moreover, specific local data are needed to support healthcare planning for this vulnerable population. Methods We conducted health facility assessments between July 2015-April 2016, with retrospective review of admission events between 1st July 2014 and 30th June 2015, and used estimates of population-based incidence of neonatal conditions in Nairobi to explore access and evaluate readiness of public, private not-for-profit (mission), and private-for-profit (private) sector facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County. Results In total, 33 (4 public, 6 mission, and 23 private) facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County were identified, 31 were studied in detail. Four public sector facilities, including the only three facilities in which services were free, accounted for 71% (8,630/12,202) of all neonatal admissions. Large facilities (>900 annual admissions) with adequate infrastructure tended to have high bed occupancy (over 100% in two facilities), high mortality (15%), and high patient to nurse ratios (7–15 patients per nurse). Twenty-one smaller, predominantly private, facilities were judged insufficiently resourced to provide adequate care. In many of these, nurses provided newborn and maternity care simultaneously using resources shared across settings, newborn care experience was likely to be limited (<50 cases per year), there was often no resident clinician, and sick babies were often referred onwards. Results suggest 44% (9,764/21,966) of Nairobi’s small and sick newborns may not access any of the identified facilities and a further 9% (2,026/21,966) access facilities judged to be inadequately equipped. Conclusion Over 50% of Nairobi’s sick newborns may not access a facility with adequate resources to provide essential care. A very high proportion of care accessed is provided by four public and one low cost mission facility; these face major challenges of high patient acuity (high mortality), high patient to nurse ratios, and often overcrowding. Reducing high neonatal mortality in this urban, predominantly poor, population will require effective long-term, multi-sectoral planning and investment."

For this aim, standalone ANFIS, ANFIS-PSO, ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-DE prediction algorithm are developed in MATLAB platform. The performance of the proposed hybrid ANFIS models is determined by computing different statistical parameters such as mean absolute bias error (MABE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The results obtained from ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS-GA enjoy higher performance and accuracy than other models, and they can be suggested for practical application to predict monthly and weekly mean wind power density. Besides, the capability of the proposed hybrid ANFIS models is examined to predict the wind data for the locations where measured wind data are not available, and the results are compared with the measured wind data from nearby stations."
https://openalex.org/W2802455578,"Gating modifier toxins (GMTs) are venom-derived peptides isolated from spiders and other venomous creatures and modulate activity of disease-relevant voltage-gated ion channels and are therefore being pursued as therapeutic leads. The amphipathic surface profile of GMTs has prompted the proposal that some GMTs simultaneously bind to the cell membrane and voltage-gated ion channels in a trimolecular complex. Here, we examined whether there is a relationship among spider GMT amphipathicity, membrane binding, and potency or selectivity for voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels. We used NMR spectroscopy and in silico calculations to examine the structures and physicochemical properties of a panel of nine GMTs and deployed surface plasmon resonance to measure GMT affinity for lipids putatively found in proximity to NaV channels. Electrophysiology was used to quantify GMT activity on NaV1.7, an ion channel linked to chronic pain. Selectivity of the peptides was further examined against a panel of NaV channel subtypes. We show that GMTs adsorb to the outer leaflet of anionic lipid bilayers through electrostatic interactions. We did not observe a direct correlation between GMT amphipathicity and affinity for lipid bilayers. Furthermore, GMT–lipid bilayer interactions did not correlate with potency or selectivity for NaVs. We therefore propose that increased membrane binding is unlikely to improve subtype selectivity and that the conserved amphipathic GMT surface profile is an adaptation that facilitates simultaneous modulation of multiple NaVs."
https://openalex.org/W2951842282,"GABA is a robust regulator of both developing and mature neural networks. It exerts many of its effects through GABAA receptors, which are heteropentamers assembled from a large array of subunits encoded by distinct genes. In mammals, there are 19 different GABAA subunit types, which are divided into the α, β, γ, δ, ε, π, θ and ρ subfamilies. The immense diversity of GABAA receptors is not fully understood. However, it is known that specific isoforms, with their distinct biophysical properties and expression profiles, tune responses to GABA. Although larval zebrafish are well-established as a model system for neural circuit analysis, little is known about GABAA receptors diversity and expression in this system. Here, using database analysis, we show that the zebrafish genome contains at least 23 subunits. All but the mammalian θ and ε subunits have at least one zebrafish ortholog, while five mammalian GABAA receptor subunits have two zebrafish orthologs. Zebrafish contain one subunit, β4, which does not have a clear mammalian ortholog. Similar to mammalian GABAA receptors, the zebrafish α subfamily is the largest and most diverse of the subfamilies. In zebrafish there are eight α subunits, and RNA in situ hybridization across early zebrafish development revealed that they demonstrate distinct patterns of expression in the brain, spinal cord, and retina. Some subunits were very broadly distributed, whereas others were restricted to small populations of cells. Subunit-specific expression patterns in zebrafish resembled were those found in frogs and rodents, which suggests that the roles of different GABAA receptor isoforms are largely conserved among vertebrates. This study provides a platform to examine isoform specific roles of GABAA receptors within zebrafish neural circuits and it highlights the potential of this system to better understand the remarkable heterogeneity of GABAA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2801755435,"Introduction Studies of community-based obesity prevention interventions have hypothesized that stakeholder networks are a critical element of effective implementation. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the interpersonal network structures within a sub-sample of stakeholders from two past successful childhood obesity prevention interventions. Methods Participants were recruited from the stakeholder groups (steering committees) of two completed community-based intervention studies, Romp & Chomp (R&C), Australia (2004-2008) and Shape Up Somerville (SUS), USA (2003-2005). Both studies demonstrated significant reductions of overweight and obesity among children. Members of the steering committees were asked to complete a retrospective social network questionnaire using a roster of other committee members and free recall. Each participant was asked to recall the people with whom they discussed issues related to childhood obesity throughout the intervention period, along with providing the closeness and level of influence of each relationship. Results Networks were reported by 13 participants from the SUS steering committee and 8 participants from the R&C steering committee. On average, participants nominated 16 contacts with whom they discussed issues related to childhood obesity through the intervention, with approximately half of the relationships described as ‘close’ and 30% as ‘influential’. The ‘discussion’ and ‘close’ networks had high clustering and reciprocity, with ties directed to other steering committee members, and to individuals external to the committee. In contrast, influential ties were more prominently directed internal to the steering committee, with higher network centralization, lower reciprocity and lower clustering. Discussion and conclusion Social network analysis provides a method to evaluate the ties within steering committees of community-based obesity prevention interventions. In this study, the network characteristics between a sub-set of stakeholders appeared to be supportive of diffused communication. Future work should prospectively examine stakeholder network structures in a heterogeneous sample of community-based interventions to identify elements most strongly associated with intervention effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2800014070,"Although research on the fertility response to childhood mortality is widespread in demographic literature, very few studies focused on the two-way causal relationships between infant mortality and fertility. Understanding the nature of such relationships is important in order to design effective policies to reduce child mortality and improve family planning. In this study, we use dynamic panel data techniques to analyse the causal effects of infant mortality on birth intervals and fertility, as well as the causal effects of birth intervals on mortality in rural Bangladesh, accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality. Simulations based upon the estimated model show whether (and to what extent) mortality and fertility can be reduced by breaking the causal links between short birth intervals and infant mortality. We find a replacement effect of infant mortality on total fertility of about 0.54 children for each infant death in the comparison area with standard health services. Eliminating the replacement effect would lengthen birth intervals and reduce the total number of births, resulting in a fall in mortality by 2.45 children per 1000 live births. These effects are much smaller in the treatment area with extensive health services and information on family planning, where infant mortality is smaller, birth intervals are longer, and total fertility is lower. In both areas, we find evidence of boy preference in family planning."
https://openalex.org/W2802962159,"Political behaviour increasingly takes place on digital platforms, where people are presented with a range of social information—real-time feedback about the behaviour of peers and reference groups—which can stimulate (or depress) participation. This social information is hypothesized to impact the distribution of political activity, stimulating participation in mobilizations that are increasing in popularity, and depressing participation in those that appear to be less popular, leading to a non-normal distribution. Changes to these platforms can generate natural experiments allowing for an estimate of the impact of different kinds of social information on participation. This paper tests the hypothesis that social information shapes the distribution of political mobilizations by examining the introduction of trending information to the homepage of the UK government petition platform. The introduction of the trending feature did not increase the overall number of signatures per day, but the distribution of signatures across petitions changed significantly—the most popular petitions gained more signatures at the expense of those with fewer signatories. We further find significant differences between petitions trending at different ranks on the homepage. This evidence suggests that the ubiquity of trending information on digital platforms is introducing instability into political markets, as has been shown for cultural markets. As well as highlighting the importance of digital design in shaping political behaviour, the findings suggest that a non-negligible group of individuals visit the homepage of the site looking for petitions to sign, without having decided the issues they wish to support in advance. These ‘aimless petitioners’ are particularly susceptible to changes in social information."

Materials and methods The current cross-sectional study conducted among three high-schools randomly selected from 10-day-public high schools in the selected sub-county from Tabriz city-Iran between December 2015 through March 2016. Participants were a sample of 107 adolescent girls aged 15–17 years old. Anthropometric parameters were measured and assessments of HRQoL, mental health problems and eating behavioral patterns were performed by Short Form 36 (SF-36), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) and Eating Behavioral Pattern Questionnaire (EBPQ) respectively. Dietary intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative Food-Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) adapted for the Iranian society. Quality of life was measured with HRQoL questionnaire. Quantitative analysis using independent sample t test was performed for comparison of continuous variables between two subgroups (unlikely, possible/probable) of each category of mental health problem. Multiple logistic regression was used to measure the potential predictors (e.g. eating patterns and HRQoL) of mental health problems in two models of crude and adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI). P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Results Indicators of conduct problems and hyperactivity disorders were the most prevalent mental health problems among female adolescents (25.2% and 18.6% respectively). The prevalence of hyperactivity disorders among female adolescents was 35.5%. Female adolescents in high scores of ‘snacking and convenience’, ‘planning ahead’ and ‘meal skipping’ eating patterns were more likely to have indicators of emotional disorders (P < 0.05). Also, being in the high tertile of ‘low fat eating’ pattern made adolescents less likely to have hyperactivity disorders (P < 0.05). Moreover, according to our finding, high scores of vitality and mental health components of HRQoL were associated with reduced likelihood of emotional disorders, conduct disorders and hyperactivity disorders. No significant difference in terms of BMI and nutrient intakes in different categories of mental health problems according to SDQ scoring was identified. Conclusions In the current study unhealthy eating patterns including ‘snacking and convenience’, ‘planning ahead’ and ‘meal skipping’ eating patterns were positive predictors of “emotional disorders” while “low fat” eating pattern was negative predictor of hyperactivity disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2802472307,"Novel applications based on the bacterial CRISPR system make genetic, genomic, transcriptional and epigenomic engineering widely accessible for the first time. A significant advantage of CRISPR over previous methods is its tremendous adaptability due to its bipartite nature. Cas9 or its engineered variants define the molecular effect, while short gRNAs determine the targeting sites. A majority of CRISPR approaches depend on the simultaneous delivery of multiple gRNAs into single cells, either as an essential precondition, to increase responsive cell populations or to enhance phenotypic outcomes. Despite these requirements, methods allowing the efficient generation and delivery of multiple gRNA expression units into single cells are still sparse. Here we present STAgR (String assembly gRNA cloning), a single step gRNA multiplexing system, that obtains its advantages by employing the N20 targeting sequences as necessary homologies for Gibson assembly. We show that STAgR allows reliable and cost-effective generation of vectors with high numbers of gRNAs enabling multiplexed CRISPR approaches. Moreover, STAgR is easily customizable, as vector backbones as well as gRNA structures, numbers and promoters can be freely chosen and combined. Finally, we demonstrate STAgR’s widespread functionality, its efficiency in multi-targeting approaches, using it for both, genome and transcriptome editing, as well as applying it in vitro and in vivo."

The cross-sectional study is based on a sample of 171 older Spanish workers aged 45-65 and beyond. We differentiated between groups of older workers in mid career (45-55 years of age) and in their later careers (56 years and beyond). Our results confirm that task characteristics and, secondarily, knowledge characteristics are the most relevant factors in perceptions of psychological work ability among aged workers. Both age groups display a very marked personal mastery trait, which mediates the relationships between job characteristics and both psychological work ability and late job mobility intentions. The paper concludes with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications and suggestions for future research on the issues implied in the psychological adjustment of older workers in their mid and late careers."
https://openalex.org/W2802636150,"Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD), protein-energy wasting (PEW), and inflammation are common interrelated features of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Less is known about lung dysfunction in CKD and its possible role in this context. We evaluated lung function and its association with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), CVD, PEW, and inflammation in individuals with normal to severely reduced GFR. Methods In 404 individuals with GFR category G1 (n = 31; GFR >90mL/min/1.73 m2), G2 (n = 46), G3 (n = 33), G4 (n = 49) and G5 (n = 245; GFR<15mL/min/1.73 m2), pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry. Obstructive (OLD) and restrictive (RLD) lung dysfunction was defined based on forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF), expressed as percentages of predicted values (%FEV1, %FVC and %PEF, respectively). PEW was evaluated by subjective global assessment, handgrip strength (HGS) and lean body mass index (LBMI), and inflammation by interleukin-6 and high sensitivity C-reactive protein. Results RLD (defined as FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.70 and %FVC<80) associated with GFR and was present in 36% of G5 and 14% of G1-4 individuals. OLD (FEV1/FVC<0.70) was less common with similar prevalence among G1-4 (9%) and G5 (11%) individuals. Notably, 64% of those with concomitant presence of PEW, inflammation and clinical signs of CVD had RLD while 79% of those lacking these complications had normal lung function. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, RLD associated with CVD, PEW and inflammation, after adjusting for Framingham’s CVD risk score, serum albumin, and GFR category. Conclusions RLD is a common complication in patients with advanced CKD, especially in those with concomitant presence of CVD, inflammation and PEW. RLD appears to be an integral albeit scarcely explored consequence of pulmonary-renal interactions in CKD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2802522067,"Background 
Mutations in the LMNA gene are a common cause (6–8%) of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leading to heart failure, a growing health care problem worldwide. The premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (HGPS) is also caused by defined mutations in the LMNA gene resulting in activation of a cryptic splice donor site leading to a defective truncated prelamin A protein called progerin. Low levels of progerin are expressed in healthy individuals associated with ageing. Here, we aimed to address the role of progerin in dilated cardiomyopathy.


Methods and results 
mRNA expression of progerin was analyzed in heart tissue of DCM (n = 15) and non-failing hearts (n = 10) as control and in blood samples from patients with DCM (n = 56) and healthy controls (n = 10). Sequencing confirmed the expression of progerin mRNA in the human heart. Progerin mRNA levels derived from DCM hearts were significantly upregulated compared to controls (1.27 ± 0.42 vs. 0.81 ± 0.24; p = 0.005). In contrast, progerin mRNA levels in whole blood cells were not significantly different in DCM patients compared to controls. Linear regression analyses revealed that progerin mRNA in the heart is significantly negatively correlated to ejection fraction (r = -0.567, p = 0.003) and positively correlated to left ventricular enddiastolic diameter (r = 0.551, p = 0.004) but not with age of the heart per se. Progerin mRNA levels were not influenced by inflammation in DCM hearts. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed increased expression of progerin protein in cell nuclei of DCM hearts associated with increased TUNEL+ apoptotic cells.


Conclusion 
Our data suggest that progerin is upregulated in human DCM hearts and strongly correlates with left ventricular remodeling. Progerin might be involved in progression of heart failure and myocardial aging."
https://openalex.org/W2800137028,"Previous evidence has suggested that dietary supplementation with a bioactive dietary polyphenol preparation (BDPP) rescues impairment of hippocampus-dependent memory in a mouse model of sleep deprivation (SD). In the current study, we extend our previous evidence and demonstrate that a mechanism by which dietary BDPP protects against SD-mediated cognitive impairment is via mechanisms that involve phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and its direct downstream targets, including the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase β-1 (p70S6K). In additional mechanistic studies in vitro, we identified the brain bioavailable phenolic metabolites derived from the metabolism of dietary BDPP that are responsible for the attenuation of SD-mediated memory impairments. On the basis of high-throughput bioavailability studies of brain bioavailable metabolites after dietary BDPP treatment, we found that select polyphenol metabolites [ e.g., cyanidin-3'- O-glucoside and 3-(3'-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid] were able to rescue mTOR and p70S6K phosphorylation in primary cortico-hippocampal neuronal cultures, as well as rescue 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in response to treatment with 4EGI-1, a specific inhibitor of eIF4E-eIF4G interaction. Our findings reveal a previously unknown role for dietary polyphenols in the rescue of SD-mediated memory impairments via mechanisms involving the promotion of protein translation.-Frolinger, T., Smith, C., Cobo, C. F., Sims, S., Brathwaite, J., de Boer, S., Huang, J., Pasinetti, G. M.

We aim to describe wheezing phenotypes between the ages of two months and one year, and assess risk factors associated with these wheezing phenotypes in a large birth cohort.We studied 18,041 infants from the ELFE (French Longitudinal Study of Children) birth cohort. Parents reported wheezing and respiratory symptoms at two and 12 months, and answered a complete questionnaire (exposure during pregnancy, parental allergy).Children with no symptoms (controls) accounted for 77.2%, 2.1% had had wheezing at two months but no wheezing at one year (intermittent), 2.4% had persistent wheezing, while 18.3% had incident wheezing at one year. Comparing persistent wheezing to controls showed that having one sibling (ORa = 2.19) or 2 siblings (ORa = 2.23) compared to none, nocturnal cough (OR = 5.2), respiratory distress (OR = 4.1) and excess bronchial secretions (OR = 3.47) at two months, reflux in the child at 2 months (OR = 1.55), maternal history of asthma (OR = 1.46) and maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.57) were significantly associated with persistent wheezing. These same factors, along with cutaneous rash in the child at 2 months (OR = 1.13) and paternal history of asthma (OR = 1.32) were significantly associated with increased odds of incident wheezing. Having one sibling (ORa = 1.9) compared to none, nocturnal cough at 2 months (OR = 1.76) and excess bronchial secretions at 2 months (OR = 1.65) were significantly associated with persistent compared to intermittent wheezing.Respiratory symptoms (cough, respiratory distress, and excessive bronchial secretion) were significantly associated with a high risk of persistent wheezing at one year. Smoking exposure during pregnancy was also a risk factor for persistent and incident wheezing."
https://openalex.org/W2800243809,"Copy number variations (CNVs) are gain and loss of DNA sequence of a genome. High throughput platforms such as microarrays and next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have been applied for genome wide copy number losses. Although progress has been made in both approaches, the accuracy and consistency of CNV calling from the two platforms remain in dispute. In this study, we perform a deep analysis on copy number losses on 254 human DNA samples, which have both SNP microarray data and NGS data publicly available from Hapmap Project and 1000 Genomes Project respectively. We show that the copy number losses reported from Hapmap Project and 1000 Genome Project only have < 30% overlap, while these reports are required to have cross-platform (e.g. PCR, microarray and high-throughput sequencing) experimental supporting by their corresponding projects, even though state-of-art calling methods were employed. On the other hand, copy number losses are found directly from HapMap microarray data by an accurate algorithm, i.e. CNVhac, almost all of which have lower read mapping depth in NGS data; furthermore, 88% of which can be supported by the sequences with breakpoint in NGS data. Our results suggest the ability of microarray calling CNVs and the possible introduction of false negatives from the unessential requirement of the additional cross-platform supporting. The inconsistency of CNV reports from Hapmap Project and 1000 Genomes Project might result from the inadequate information containing in microarray data, the inconsistent detection criteria, or the filtration effect of cross-platform supporting. The statistical test on CNVs called from CNVhac show that the microarray data can offer reliable CNV reports, and majority of CNV candidates can be confirmed by raw sequences. Therefore, the CNV candidates given by a good caller could be highly reliable without cross-platform supporting, so additional experimental information should be applied in need instead of necessarily."
https://openalex.org/W2800237079,"Purpose This study developed a measure of physical post traumatic growth (physical post traumatic growth inventory; P-PTGI) in men with prostate cancer. Methods A pool of items was created from themes identified in a qualitative study. A quantitative study was then conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the P-PTGI in a sample of 693 prostate cancer survivors. Results Tests of dimensionality revealed that the 20-item P-PTGI contained two factors: Health Autonomy and Health Awareness. Results demonstrated that scale score reliability for the P-PTGI and its subscales was excellent. In support of the scale’s convergent validity, scores on the P-PTGI correlated positively with mindfulness and quality of life, and correlated negatively with depression and anxiety. A statistically significant correlation between the P-PTGI and another robust indicator of post traumatic growth attests to its concurrent validity. Conclusions While further investigation of the P-PTGI’s psychometric properties is required, preliminary findings are promising."
https://openalex.org/W2800652570,"Alcohol misuse is a well-known risk factor for suicide however, the relationship between alcohol-related hospital admission and subsequent risk of death from suicide is unknown. We aimed to determine the risk of death from suicide following emergency admission to hospital with an alcohol-related cause.We established an electronic cohort study of all 2,803,457 residents of Wales, UK, aged from 10 to under 100 years on 1 January 2006 with six years' follow-up. The outcome event was death from suicide defined as intentional self-harm (ICD-10 X60-84) or undetermined intent (Y10-34). The main exposure was an alcohol-related admission defined as a 'wholly attributable' ICD-10 alcohol code in the admission record. Admissions were coded for the presence or absence of co-existing psychiatric morbidity. The analysis was by Cox regression with adjustments for confounding variables within the dataset.During the study follow-up period, there were 15,546,355 person years at risk with 28,425 alcohol-related emergency admissions and 1562 suicides. 125 suicides followed an admission (144.6 per 100,000 person years), of which 11 (9%) occurred within 4 weeks of discharge. The overall adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for suicide following admission was 26.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.8 to 38.3), in men HR 9.83 (95% CI 7.91 to 12.2) and women HR 28.5 (95% CI 19.9 to 41.0). The risk of suicide remained substantial in subjects without known co-existing psychiatric morbidity: HR men 8.11 (95% CI 6.30 to 10.4) and women HR 24.0 (95% CI 15.5 to 37.3). The analysis was limited by the absence in datasets of potentially important confounding variables and the lack of information on alcohol-related harm and psychiatric morbidity in subjects not admitted to hospital.Emergency alcohol-related hospital admission is associated with an increased risk of suicide. Identifying individuals in hospital provides an opportunity for psychosocial assessment and suicide prevention of a targeted at-risk group before their discharge to the community."
https://openalex.org/W2801422011,"Background Expanding HIV screening for populations at risk necessitates testing in nontraditional settings. We assessed HIV testing in dental clinics in South Florida, an urban area with the highest rates of HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2015. Aims We explored patients’ acceptance of oral HIV rapid tests administered by dental providers and identified reasons for accepting or declining HIV testing. Methods During 2014 and 2015, dentists and hygienists at two federally qualified health center (FQHC) dental clinics who serve racial/ethnic minority patient populations in South Florida were trained to administer oral HIV rapid tests as a part of a routine dental visit. Patients presenting for dental services were offered a rapid HIV test and brief survey regarding their demographics, HIV testing history and behaviors. Results We enrolled 600 patients (median age = 43 years; IQR: 29–56 years), 45% non-Hispanic black and 35% Hispanic/Latino, 83% graduated high school, and 50% unemployed. Most (85%) accepted oral HIV rapid testing (none tested HIV-positive); 14% had never been tested for HIV. The most common reasons for testing were a desire to know HIV status (56%) and free testing (54%). Among 93 (15%) patients who declined testing, 58% were tested recently and 31% felt confident that they were HIV-negative; however, 74 (80%) who declined testing said they would feel comfortable discussing HIV prevention with their dentist. Additionally, 290 of 600 patients (48%) reported condomless vaginal or anal sex in the past 6 months. Further, among 119 patients who had condomless sex with an HIV-positive partner and/or one whose HIV status was unknown, 98 (82%) accepted the oral HIV test. Conclusion Dental clinics may provide expanded opportunities for oral HIV rapid testing and conversations about HIV prevention in high HIV prevalence communities."

Understanding HIV vaccine-induced immune responses at mucosal surfaces can generate hypotheses regarding mechanisms of protection, and may influence vaccine development. The RV144 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00223080) efficacy trial showed protection against HIV infections but mucosal samples were not collected, therefore, the contribution of mucosal antibodies to preventing HIV-1 acquisition is unknown. Here, we report the generation, magnitude and persistence of antibody responses to recombinant gp120 envelope and antigens including variable one and two loop scaffold antigens (gp70V1V2) previously shown to correlate with risk in RV144. We evaluated antibody responses to gp120 A244gD and gp70V1V2 92TH023 (both CRF01_AE) and Case A2 (subtype B) in cervico-vaginal mucus (CVM), seminal plasma (SP) and rectal secretions (RS) from HIV-uninfected RV144 vaccine recipients, who were randomized to receive two late boosts of ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E, AIDSVAX®B/E, or ALVAC-HIV alone at 0 and 6 months. Late vaccine boosting increased IgG geometric mean titers (GMT) to gp120 A244gD in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM (28 and 17 fold, respectively), followed by SP and RS. IgG to gp70V1V2 92TH023 increased in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM (11–17 fold) and SP (2 fold) two weeks post first boost. IgG to Case A2 was only detected in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM. Mucosal IgG to gp120 A244gD (CVM, SP, RS), gp70V1V2 92TH023 (CVM, SP), and Case A2 (CVM) correlated with plasma IgG levels (p<0.001). Although the magnitude of IgG responses declined after boosting, anti-gp120 A244gD IgG responses in CVM persisted for 12 months post final vaccination. Further studies in localization, persistence and magnitude of envelope specific antibodies (IgG and dimeric IgA) in anogenital secretions will help determine their role in preventing mucosal HIV acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2801739429,"The ability to express a gene of interest in a spatio-temporal manner using Gal4-UAS system has allowed the use of Drosophila model to study various biological phenomenon. During Drosophila eye development, a synchronous wave of differentiation called Morphogenetic furrow (MF) initiates at the posterior margin resulting in differentiation of retinal neurons. This synchronous differentiation is also observed in the differentiating retina of vertebrates. Since MF is highly dynamic, it can serve as an excellent model to study patterning and differentiation. However, there are not any Gal4 drivers available to observe the gain- of- function or loss- of- function of a gene specifically along the dynamic MF. The decapentaplegic (dpp) gene encodes a secreted protein of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily that expresses at the posterior margin and then moves with the MF. However, unlike the MF associated pattern of dpp gene expression, the targeted dpp-Gal4 driver expression is restricted to the posterior margin of the developing eye disc. We screened GMR lines harboring regulatory regions of dpp fused with Gal4 coding region to identify MF specific enhancer of dpp using a GFP reporter gene. We employed immuno-histochemical approaches to detect gene expression. The rationale was that GFP reporter expression will correspond to the dpp expression domain in the developing eye. We identified two new dpp-Gal4 lines, viz., GMR17E04-Gal4 and GMR18D08-Gal4 that carry sequences from first intron region of dpp gene. GMR17E04-Gal4 drives expression along the MF during development and later in the entire pupal retina whereas GMR18D08-Gal4 drives expression of GFP transgene in the entire developing eye disc, which later drives expression only in the ventral half of the pupal retina. Thus, GMR18D08-Gal4 will serve as a new reagent for targeting gene expression in the ventral half of the pupal retina. We compared misexpression phenotypes of Wg, a negative regulator of eye development, using GMR17E04-Gal4, GMR18D08-Gal4 with existing dpp-Gal4 driver. The eye phenotypes generated by using our newly identified MF specific driver are not similar to the ones generated by existing dpp-Gal4 driver. It suggests that misexpression studies along MF needs revisiting using the new Gal4 drivers generated in our studies."
https://openalex.org/W2801117803,"This paper presents the concept of Simultaneous Localization and Multi-Mapping (SLAMM). It is a system that ensures continuous mapping and information preservation despite failures in tracking due to corrupted frames or sensor's malfunction; making it suitable for real-world applications. It works with single or multiple robots. In a single robot scenario the algorithm generates a new map at the time of tracking failure, and later it merges maps at the event of loop closure. Similarly, maps generated from multiple robots are merged without prior knowledge of their relative poses; which makes this algorithm flexible. The system works in real time at frame-rate speed. The proposed approach was tested on the KITTI and TUM RGB-D public datasets and it showed superior results compared to the state-of-the-arts in calibrated visual monocular keyframe-based SLAM. The mean tracking time is around 22 milliseconds. The initialization is twice as fast as it is in ORB-SLAM, and the retrieved map can reach up to 90 percent more in terms of information preservation depending on tracking loss and loop closure events. For the benefit of the community, the source code along with a framework to be run with Bebop drone are made available at https://github.com/hdaoud/ORBSLAMM."
https://openalex.org/W2801353285,"Beta cell dysfunction accompanies and drives the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), but there are few clinical biomarkers available to assess islet cell stress in humans. Secretagogin, a protein enriched in pancreatic islets, demonstrates protective effects on beta cell function in animals. However, its potential as a circulating biomarker released from human beta cells and islets has not been studied. In this study primary human islets, beta cells and plasma samples were used to explore secretion and expression of secretagogin in relation to the T2D pathology. Secretagogin was abundantly and specifically expressed and secreted from human islets. Furthermore, T2D patients had an elevated plasma level of secretagogin compared with matched healthy controls, which was confirmed in plasma of diabetic mice transplanted with human islets. Additionally, the plasma secretagogin level of the human cohort had an inverse correlation to clinical assessments of beta cell function. To explore the mechanism of secretagogin release in vitro, human beta cells (EndoC-βH1) were exposed to elevated glucose or cellular stress-inducing agents. Secretagogin was not released in parallel with glucose stimulated insulin release, but was markedly elevated in response to endoplasmic reticulum stressors and cytokines. These findings indicate that secretagogin is a potential novel biomarker, reflecting stress and islet cell dysfunction in T2D patients."

https://openalex.org/W2802419957,"Small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) regulate many genes in eukaryotic cells. Hua enhancer 1 (Hen1) is a 2'-O-methyltransferase that adds a methyl group to the 2'-OH of the 3'-terminal nucleotide of sncRNAs. The types and properties of sncRNAs may vary among different species, and the domain composition, structure, and function of Hen1 proteins differ accordingly. In mammals, Hen1 specifically methylates sncRNAs called P-element-induced wimpy testis-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). However, other types of sncRNAs that are methylated by Hen1 have not yet been reported, and the structures and the substrates of mammalian Hen1 remain unknown. Here, we report that mouse Hen1 (mHen1) performs 3'-end methylation of classical piRNAs, as well as those of most noncanonical piRNAs derived from rRNAs, small nuclear RNAs and tRNAs in murine spermatogonial stem cells. Moreover, we found that a distinct class of tRNA-derived sncRNAs are mHen1 substrates. We further determined the crystal structure of the putative methyltransferase domain of human Hen1 (HsHen1) in complex with its cofactor AdoMet at 2.0 Å resolution. We observed that HsHen1 has an active site similar to that of plant Hen1. We further found that the putative catalytic domain of HsHen1 alone exhibits no activity. However, an FXPP motif at its N terminus conferred full activity to this domain, and additional binding assays suggested that the FXPP motif is important for substrate binding. Our findings shed light on its methylation substrates in mouse spermatogonial stem cells and the substrate-recognition mechanism of mammalian Hen1."

However, they can affect the development of non-target arthropods. In the present study, we tested the effects of the growth regulator insecticide fenoxycarb on several endpoints in the freshwater crustacean Gammarus fossarum (Amphipoda). Females carrying embryos in their open brood pouch were exposed to 50 μg L-1 fenoxycarb throughout the entire oogenesis (i.e. 21 days). After exposure, newborn individuals from exposed embryos were removed from the maternal open brood pouch for lipidomic analysis, while males were added to assess the reproductive success. After fertilization, the lipid profile, energy reserve content (lipids, proteins and glycogen), and activity of phenoloxidase - an enzyme involved in the immune response - were measured in females. No significant effect of fenoxycarb exposure was observed on the lipid profile of both newborn individuals and females, while reproductive success was severely impaired in exposed females. Particularly, precopulatory behavior was significantly reduced and fertilized eggs were unviable. This study highlighted the deleterious effects of the insect growth regulator fenoxycarb on gammarid reproduction, which could have severe repercussions on population dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2803087414,"Decidual protein induced by progesterone (DEPP/DEPP1/C10ORF10) is induced by denying access to food and reduced by refeeding in insulin-sensitive organs in vivo. The negative regulation of DEPP by insulin is also proven in several cell lines. However, the functions of DEPP in insulin-sensitive organs remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the impact of DEPP on hepatic energy metabolism and addressed the underlying mechanisms. The metabolic effects of DEPP were investigated in mice with adenovirus-mediated hepatic overexpression. Liver triglyceride (TG), glycogen, and serum metabolites were detected by biochemical assays. Energy homeostasis was measured by indirect calorimetry. Quantitative PCR was used to examine expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, lipogenesis, and gluconeogenesis. To evaluate the role of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) mediating the metabolic effects of DEPP, FGF21 antibody was administrated intraperitoneally to mice at 24 h after the delivery of adenovirus, and the metabolic alterations were examined. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured by catalase activity assay, live cell fluorescence, or quantitative PCR. Effects of DEPP on the phenotype of db/db mice were also assessed. Acute hepatic overexpression of DEPP significantly reduced serum glucose and TG levels, dramatically elevated β-hydroxybutyrate levels, and improved glucose clearance. Compared with controls, DEPP overexpression reduced food intake, the energy expenditure rate, and the respiratory quotient. DEPP overexpression significantly increased fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis but suppressed lipid synthesis and gluconeogenesis. Investigations of the underlying mechanisms revealed that DEPP regulates energy metabolism by inducing oxidative stress. With the impairment of the ROS scavenging system and promotion of ROS formation, DEPP overexpression leads to ROS accumulation. FGF21 is upregulated in response to oxidative stress and mediates the effects of DEPP on fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and lipid synthesis but not gluconeogenesis, as evidenced by the fact that the FGF21 antibody dramatically suppressed a DEPP-induced increase of fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, reversed the reduction of lipid synthesis, but did not change the suppression of gluconeogenesis. Moreover, overexpression of DEPP in db/ db mice led to a marked reduction in body weight and serum glucose levels and significantly improved insulin sensitivity. Hepatic overexpression of DEPP in mice promotes fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis and suppresses lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis, which is partly mediated by FGF21 induced by elevated cellular ROS levels.-Li, W., Ji, M., Lin, Y., Miao, Y., Chen, S., Li, H.

https://openalex.org/W2611679783,"Evolution and propagation of the world's languages is a complex phenomenon, driven, to a large extent, by social interactions. Multilingual society can be seen as a system of interacting agents, where the interaction leads to a modification of the language spoken by the individuals. Two people can reach the state of full linguistic compatibility due to the positive interactions, like transfer of loanwords. But, on the other hand, if they speak entirely different languages, they will separate from each other. These simple observations make the network science the most suitable framework to describe and analyze dynamics of language change. Although many mechanisms have been explained, we lack a qualitative description of the scaling behavior for different sizes of a population. Here we address the issue of the language diversity in societies of different sizes, and we show that local interactions are crucial to capture characteristics of the empirical data. We propose a model of social interactions, extending the idea from, that explains the growth of the language diversity with the size of a population of country or society. We argue that high clustering and network disintegration are the most important characteristics of models properly describing empirical data. Furthermore, we cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case. Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change."

Genetic programming (GP) is a stochastic approach to solving a problem. For high dimensional datasets, GP does not perform as well as other machine learning algorithms. To explore the inherent property of GP to generalize models from low dimensional data, we need to consider dimensionality reduction approaches. Random projections (RPs) have gained attention for reducing the dimensionality of data with reduced computational cost, compared to other dimensionality reduction approaches. We report that the features constructed from RPs perform extremely well when combined with a GP approach. We used eight datasets out of which seven have not been reported as being used in any machine learning research before. We have also compared our results by using the same full and constructed features for decision trees, random forest, naive Bayes, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbor methods."

Data were collected in 2012 by the New Orleans arm of the CDC funded National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. Respondent driven sampling was used to recruit a sample of PWID. The analytic sample consisted of 473 participants. Univariate, bivariate, and linear regression analyses were performed. Findings indicated that history of drug treatment is associated with sterile syringe use among PWID. Further, knowledge of HCV status modifies the relationship between history of drug treatment and sterile syringe use in this sample. These findings highlight the importance of scaling up prevention efforts by expanding testing, counselling, and treatment for HCV among PWID who enter drug treatment facilities."

DFTD has spread over the distribution range of the species and has been responsible for a severe decline in the global devil population. To protect the Tasmanian devil from extinction in the wild, our group has focused on the development of a prophylactic vaccine. Although this work has shown that vaccine preparations using whole DFTD tumour cells supplemented with adjuvants can induce anti-DFTD immune responses, alternative strategies that induce stronger and more specific immune responses are required. In humans, heat shock proteins (HSPs) derived from tumour cells have been used instead of whole-tumour cell preparations as a source of antigens for cancer immunotherapy. As HSPs have not been studied in the Tasmanian devil, this study presents the first characterisation of HSPs in this marsupial and evaluates the suitability of these proteins as antigenic components for the enhancement of a DFTD vaccine. We show that tissues and cancer cells from the Tasmanian devil express constitutive and inducible HSP. Additionally, this study suggests that HSP derived from DFTD cancer cells are immunogenic supporting the future development of a HSP-based vaccine against DFTD."

The proposed protocol is formally verified with an automated tool(ProVerif). The proposed protocol has superior efficiency in comparison to the existing protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2800543064,"Schmallenberg virus (SBV), initially identified in Germany in 2011, spread rapidly throughout Europe causing significant economic losses in ruminant livestock. The ability to correctly detect emerging and re-emerging diseases such as SBV with reliable tests is of high importance. Firstly, we tested diagnostic performance, specificity, and sensitivity of three different assays used in SBV antibody detection using control sheep samples of determined status. After obtaining the results from the control samples, we assessed the potential of the assays to detect previously infected animals in field situations. The samples were investigated using IDEXX Schmallenberg virus Antibody Test Kit, ID Screen Schmallenberg virus Competition Multi-species ELISA and Serum Neutralisation Test (SNT). Analysis of control samples revealed that SNT was the most suitable test, which was therefore used to calculate concordance and test performance for the two other ELISA tests. To evaluate whether different assay performances had an impact under field conditions, sheep samples from two different contexts were tested: the emergence of SBV in Ireland and the re-emergence of SBV in Belgium. Comparing the results obtained from different assays to the non-reference standard assay SNT, we showed considerable differences in estimates of their sensitivity to detect SBV antibodies and to measure seroprevalence of the sheep flocks. Finally, a calculation of the number of randomly selected animals that needs to be screened from a finite flock, showed that SNT and ID.Vet are the most suitable to detect an introduction of the disease in low seroprevalence situations. The IDEXX ELISA test was only able to detect SBV antibodies in a higher seroprevalence context, which is not optimal for monitoring freedom of disease and surveillance studies."
https://openalex.org/W2801322545,"Introduction Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TUSPB) is the standard method of diagnosis for prostate cancer, and although it is well tolerated by some patients, it presents a discomfort rate of 65 to 90%, which may be associated with pain. For convenience, it is agreed that a method of analgesia and sedation is necessary. For this purpose, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of inhalation of a 50–50% N2O-O2 gas mixture on pain intensity in these patients. Material and methods Randomized, double-blinded clinical trial, conducted at Antônio Pedro University Hospital (Hospital Universitário Antônio Pedro), Niterói, RJ, Brazil, containing two groups of 42 patients: a control (C) group, which received 100% oxygen inhalation, and a nitrous oxide (NO) group, which received inhalation of the 50–50% N2O-O2 mixture, self-administered during TUSPB. The pain intensity and degree of satisfaction were evaluated through a visual analogue scale (VAS), as was the frequency of adverse events. Results Eighty-four patients were included in the study, with 42 in each group. The mean pain intensity was lower in the NO group than in the C group [2.52 (0–10) vs 5.95 (0–10), p < 0.001], and the degree of satisfaction was higher in the NO group than in the C group (8.14 vs. 4.69, p < 0.001). The adverse effects were somnolence, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, discomfort and euphoria without differences between the groups. Conclusion The 50–50% N2O-O2 mixture was effective in reducing pain intensity and increasing the degree of satisfaction in TUSPB, with tolerable side effects."

Which algorithms the brain uses to achieve this feat are largely unknown and an open problem in visual neuroscience. We demonstrate that a simple dynamical mechanism can account for this contrast-dependent scale of integration in visuotopic space as well as connect this property to two other stimulus-dependent features of V1: extents of lateral integration on the cortical surface and response latencies."
https://openalex.org/W2799918356,"Conventional decision theory suggests that under risk, people choose option(s) by maximizing the expected utility. However, theories deal ambiguously with different options that have the same expected utility. A network approach is proposed by introducing ‘goal’ and ‘time’ factors to reduce the ambiguity in strategies for calculating the time-dependent probability of reaching a goal. As such, a mathematical foundation that explains the irrational behavior of choosing an option with a lower expected utility is revealed, which could imply that humans possess rationality in foresight."
https://openalex.org/W2801203587,"Many vaccines contain multiple components. Licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) contain polysaccharides from 7, 10, or 13 different serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The main outcomes in randomised trials of pneumococcal vaccines are serotype-specific antibody measures. Comparisons are made between groups for each serotype, resulting in multiple separate comparisons of treatment effects which can be complicated to interpret. We investigated methods for computing the overall difference between vaccine groups across all serotypes.Pneumococcal antibody concentrations were obtained from a randomised controlled trial of ten-valent pneumococcal vaccine, conducted in Kathmandu, Nepal. Infants received either 2 priming doses of vaccine at 6 and 14 weeks of age followed by a booster (2+1), or 3 priming doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age with no booster (3+0). The overall difference between vaccine schedules across all serotypes was computed at each visit using a multivariate linear model with equal weights for each serotype. Alternative weights were derived from invasive pneumococcal disease cases in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and from estimates of the relative invasiveness of each serotype and used in sensitivity analyses.When 10 separate estimates of treatment differences were computed the ratio of antibody responses for each serotype in the 2+1 group compared with the 3+0 group at 10 months of age varied greatly, with serotype-specific GMRs ranging from 2.80 for serotype 14, to 9.14 for serotype 18C. Using equal weights for each serotype, the overall geometric mean ratio (GMR) was 5.02 (95% CI 4.06-6.22) at 10 months of age, and 1.46 (95% CI 1.14-1.88) at 3 years of age. Using weights based on disease incidence gave GMRs ranging from 5.15 to 6.63 at 10 months of age, and 1.47 to 1.78 at 3 years of age. Using weights based on relative invasiveness gave estimates of 6.81 and 1.59, at 10 months and 3 years respectively.PCV clinical trial data have a multivariate structure with correlated outcomes for different serotypes. When analysing each serotype separately, the multiple estimates of the treatment effect can complicate the interpretation of trial results. Reporting a single overall estimate which accounts for the correlation between outcomes can simplify such interpretation. Treatment effects can be weighted equally or alternative weights derived from independent data can be used. Many modern vaccines have multiple components, such as quadrivalent meningococcal group ACWY vaccine or four-component group B meningococcal vaccine, thus these methods are widely applicable."
https://openalex.org/W2802477967,"Ex vivo heart perfusion systems, allowing continuous perfusion of the coronary vasculature, have recently been introduced to limit ischemic time of donor hearts prior to transplantation. Hearts are, however, perfused in an unloaded manner (via the aorta) and therefore, cardiac contractile function cannot be reliably evaluated.We aim to develop a ventricular loading device that enables monitoring of myocardial function in an ex vivo perfusion system. In this initial study, was to develop a prototype for rat experimentation.We designed a device consisting of a ventricular balloon and a reservoir balloon, connected through an electronic check valve, which opens and closes in coordination with changes in ventricular pressure. All balloons were produced in our laboratory and their properties, particularly pressure-volume relationships, were characterized. We developed a mock ventricle in vitro test system to evaluate the device, which was ultimately tested in ex vivo perfused rat hearts.Balloon production was consistent and balloon properties were maintained over time and with use on the device. Results from in vitro and ex vivo experiments show that the device functions appropriately; hemodynamic function can be measured and compares well to measurements made in an isolated, working (loaded) rat heart preparation.Our cardiac loading device appears to reliably allow measurement of several left ventricular hemodynamic parameters and provides the opportunity to control ventricular load."
