https://openalex.org/W2055960628,"A high frequency of chromosomal breakage and rearrangement has been found in cultured blood cells from six of seven individuals with a rare syndrome characterized by congenital telangiectatic erythema and stunted growth. Only 19 instances of this apparently genetically determined disorder are known, and malignant neoplasia has developed in three."

Images of targets nearer or farther away are proportionately blurred. However, during the first few postnatal months the range of flexible accommodation increases and approximates adult performance by the 4th month."
https://openalex.org/W1992830959,"A psychophysical choice technique can be used to measure discrimination of the stimuli produced by two fixed-ratio schedules. As the difference between the two ratios is reduced, the number of errors in discrimination increases. The analysis differentiates between discrimination and response bias, which are frequently confused in animal psychophysics."

The active agents have been identified in the electron microscope as thin appendages called F-pili. Complexes of F-pili and phage may be easily assayed because of their retention by membrane filter pads. Calcium ion is required for formation of the complex."

https://openalex.org/W1988304207,"Anomalous growths of the colonial, deep-water coral Madrepora kauaiensis are interpreted as neoplasia. Since tissue was not preserved, evidence is derived solely from skeletal examination and consists of unusually rapid growth and progressively disordered growth of skeletal structures."
https://openalex.org/W2024924745,"Commoner and Ternberg1,2 have reported the presence of electron spin resonance signals from samples of normal rat, mouse, guinea-pig and human tissues. The samples were all surviving tissues measured quickly after the death of the animal and the signals remained for up to 100 min after death, disappearing more rapidly at the higher temperature at which the sample was maintained in the electron spin resonance spectrometer. The signals all occurred around g = 2.004, indicating that free electron spins were present, perhaps in the form of free radicals, which were the origin of the resonant absorption signals. The size of signal was reasonably consistent for a given material but differed from tissue to tissue, and in the rat, mouse and guinea-pig were greatest for liver, with smaller signals from kidney and heart. Signals were also observed for intestines, adrenals and lung, but only low-intensity signals, if any, were reported for skeletal muscle and spleen."
https://openalex.org/W2038592404,"Hydroxylamine can induce any one of the four types of transition mutations in bacteriophage S13 if the mutagen is added directly to agar plates seeded with phage and bacterial indicators. The phage can also be mutated by treating the host cell with hydroxylamine before infecting it with phage. These effects of hydroxylamine in vivo contrast with the mutagenic effect in vitro, which seems to be exclusively on cytosine."
https://openalex.org/W1977315408,"WITH a few exceptions1, almost all the remarkably frost-resistant insects have been shown to contain glycerol or sorbitol2. The overwintering pre-pupal larv√¶ of a sawfly, Trichiocampus populi Okamoto, however, were found to survive freezing at a liquid gas temperature without any polyhydric alcohol. An extraordinarily large amount of a sugar, trehalose, was detected in this insect."
https://openalex.org/W2009460922,"Glutamine synthetase activity in the neural retina of the chick embryo increases sharply during terminal differentiation of this tissue. This characteristic increase can be reproduced in cultures of retinal tissue fragments from late embryos. A similarly sharp increase can be elicited precociously in younger retina by culturing in medium with adult serum. Both the precociously elicited and the later increase in enzyme activity require continuous protein synthesis; both can be suppressed during the first 24 hours of culture by blocking RNA synthesis or by removing the adult serum. Subsequently, the increase in enzyme activity becomes progressively less dependent on RNA synthesis and on the continuous presence of adult serum. This transition is attained more rapidly in the older retina. The data suggest a progressive stabilization of the enzyme-forming system during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2057071199,"Cytological investigations of both laboratory and wild ""sex ratio"" lines of Drosophila pseudoobscura reveal that, contrary to earlier reports, no extra replication of the X chromosome occurs in primary spermatocytes. Normal disjunction of the sex chromosomes at anaphase I leads to equal numbers of X-bearing and Y-bearing secondary spermatocytes. In the latter, the Y chromosome regularly shows a ""degeneration"" at second anaphase. The ""sex ratio"" effect can be explained in terms of regularly nonfunctional products of meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2052293649,"When the cells of Drosophila embryos are dissociated and cultured in vitro, aggregation of the cells begins rapidly and movements of the cells continue for at least 5 days. Oenocytes, hypoderm, nerve, muscle, and trachea cells take up characteristic positions in the aggregates. Cells from X2 mutant embryos sort out in identically the same way as do cells from normal embryos."
https://openalex.org/W1972972468,"The oldest series of human skeletons in the New World shows a high incidence of traumatic lesions during the early nomadic hunting and gathering phase, dental patterns which reflect the transition to an agricultural economy, some evidences of microevolution occurring in a local population, and one probable example of pre-Columbian syphilis."
https://openalex.org/W1988870038,"The 7-day white Peking duck embryo contains two hemoglobins (Hb's III and IV) which are electrophoretically distinct from the two adult hemoglobins (Hb's I and II). Hemoglobin IV had disappeared in the 14-day embryo, at which time Hb's I and II are evident. The synthesis of Hb III is not restricted to embryonic life but continues in the duckling and ceases before the 10th week of development after hatching."

https://openalex.org/W1991008219,"Treatment of normal green Euglena gracilis with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine results in permanent loss of the ability to form chloroplasts in close to 100 percent of the organisms. The resulting ""bleached"" strains can be maintained for over 100 generations; no reversion to chloroplast-containing organisms occurs within this time. Alkylating agents, azaserine, mitomycin C, acridines, nitrous acid, hydroxylamine, and gamma-irradiation do not bleach significant proportions of cells even at concentrations sufficient to kill most of the cells. These results may be due partly to differences in the base compositions of nuclear and chloroplast DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1982777945,"IT is known that in biological systems histamine is broken down by histaminase1. In this reaction oxygen is consumed and hydrogen peroxide is formed. A mano-metric method of measurement2 is based on the oxygen consumption and a chemical method3,4 on the production of hydrogen peroxide. In the latter method indigo is added to the incubation mixture and the discoloration of this mixture by the hydrogen peroxide formed is a measure of the enzyme activity. This is due to the peroxidatic activity of catalase mostly present in the biological fluids or tissue extracts under test. The disadvantages of the chemical method are the long incubation period of 24 h and the necessity of at least 1 ml. of serum in the case of histaminase determinations in blood."

https://openalex.org/W2077056424,RECENTLY1 we demonstrated that two substances which we believe to be proteins carry the vitamin B12 in the plasma of normal subjects. These will be referred to as transcobalamin I and II. We then investigated their behaviour in the plasma of patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and found a major abnormality.

https://openalex.org/W2011369719,"THE level of utilizable glucose represents a control of the release of free fatty acids (FFA) and, therefore, of the level of serum FFA1. Drugs acting on glucose utilization are therefore likely to be effective in changing the level of FFA. The observation that salicylate increases oxidative reactions2,3 led us to the finding that this drug is a powerful inhibitor of FFA release. Previous investigations carried out in man were contradictory. While Carlson4,5 found a decrease of plasma FFA in normal and diabetic subjects, Gilgore et al.6 did not confirm these results. However, it is likely that in the latter data there was an interference of salicylate in the determinations of FFA carried out according to Dole's method."

https://openalex.org/W2047812221,"DURING the toasting process of oat flakes a number of components influencing their organoleptic properties are developed. Some of them escape with the steam; others are non-volatile. Among the non-volatile components the carbonyl compounds predominate1. It is, however, interesting that during the toasting process amines, a number of sulphur compounds and other so far unidentified compounds are also formed. For isolation, the volatile compounds obtained in processing were transferred to corresponding chlorides. On purifying the samples to be examined, the amines were separated by means of paper chromatography and identified by their standards, RF values and by means of the necessary agents."

https://openalex.org/W2056201583,"Werboff and Kesner1 have claimed that administration of meprobamate to gravid rats for four successive days during any period of pregnancy resulted in offspring that, compared with the controls, were lighter in body-weight and significantly poorer at learning a Lashley III maze. The latter deficiency was attributed to some unspecified effect of the drug on the developing brain. Since previous experience with meprobamate had not revealed any deleterious effects on body-weight or size among the progeny of meprobamate-treated females2, and since it seemed unlikely that a cerebral impairment due to prenatal drug exposure should be unrelated to the embryo's age at the time of insult3, we repeated the Werboff and Kesner experiment. This replication also provided the opportunity for verifying an earlier report by Werboff and Havlena4 that prenatal exposure to meprobamate altered performance on the inclined plane and in the open-field test."

https://openalex.org/W2088840582,"For each tenfold increase in the concentration of serotonin in the range 10(-7) to 10(-4)M, the beat frequency of the lateral cilia of the gills of the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanatus increases by approximately two beats per second over the mean frequency of 14.5 beats per second for control gills perfused with 0.04M potassium chloride. The addition of 10(-6) to 10(-3)M concentrations of adenosine triphosphate has no detectable effect on the beat frequency. The addition of both serotonin and 10(-4)M adenosine triphosphate increases the frequency by two beats per second more than does the addition of serotonin alone."

https://openalex.org/W2079528807,"DURING the course of a long-term investigation of isolated, fresh, absorptive cells of the rat's jejunum suspended in physiological saline, prepared by the method described by Mohiuddin and Ramsbotham1, we have occasionally come across cells showing a particular abnormality. This consists of a dome-like elevation of the plasmalemma over an accumulation of clear fluid covering one surface of the cell or, at the most, two adjacent surfaces. When this change affects the apex the striated border becomes unrecognizable, probably because the microvilli are taken in by the ballooning plasmalemma. In this respect the condition differs markedly from the transient apical blistering due to rapid pinocytosis reported by Mohiuddin2."
