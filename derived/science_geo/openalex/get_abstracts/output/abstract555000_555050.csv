https://openalex.org/W2294496489,"Majorana zero modes are quasiparticle excitations in condensed matter systems that have been proposed as building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers [1]. They are expected to exhibit non-Abelian particle statistics, in contrast to the usual statistics of fermions and bosons, enabling quantum operations to be performed by braiding isolated modes around one another. Quantum braiding operations are topologically protected insofar as these modes are pinned near zero energy, and the pinning is predicted to be exponential as the modes become spatially separated. Following theoretical proposals, several experiments have identified signatures of Majorana modes in proximitized nanowires and atomic chains, with small mode-splitting potentially explained by hybridization of Majoranas. Here, we use Coulomb-blockade spectroscopy in an InAs nanowire segment with epitaxial aluminum, which forms a proximity-induced superconducting Coulomb island (a Majorana island) that is isolated from normal-metal leads by tunnel barriers, to measure the splitting of near-zero-energy Majorana modes. We observe exponential suppression of energy splitting with increasing wire length. For short devices of a few hundred nanometers, sub-gap state energies oscillate as the magnetic field is varied, as is expected for hybridized Majorana modes. Splitting decreases by a factor of about ten for each half micrometer of increased wire length. For devices longer than about one micrometer, transport in strong magnetic fields occurs through a zero-energy state that is energetically isolated from a continuum, yielding uniformly spaced Coulomb-blockade conductance peaks, consistent with teleportation via Majorana modes. Our results help explain the trivial-to-topological transition in finite systems and to quantify the scaling of topological protection with end-mode separation."
https://openalex.org/W2293062392,"The net balance of terrestrial biogenic greenhouse gases produced as a result of human activities and the climatic impact of this balance are uncertain; here the net cumulative impact of the three greenhouse gases, methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, on the planetary energy budget from 2001 to 2010 is a warming of the planet. The biogenic fluxes of individual greenhouse gases have extensively studied, but the net terrestrial biogenic greenhouse gas balance as a result of human activities and its climatic impact remains uncertain. Hanqin Tian et al. have quantified the net cumulative impact of three greenhouse gases — methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide — on the planetary energy budget. From 2001 to 2010, they find a net positive (warming) cumulative impact and conclude that a reduction in agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions — in particular in Southern Asia — may help mitigate climate change. The terrestrial biosphere can release or absorb the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and therefore has an important role in regulating atmospheric composition and climate1. Anthropogenic activities such as land-use change, agriculture and waste management have altered terrestrial biogenic greenhouse gas fluxes, and the resulting increases in methane and nitrous oxide emissions in particular can contribute to climate change2,3. The terrestrial biogenic fluxes of individual greenhouse gases have been studied extensively4,5,6, but the net biogenic greenhouse gas balance resulting from anthropogenic activities and its effect on the climate system remains uncertain. Here we use bottom-up (inventory, statistical extrapolation of local flux measurements, and process-based modelling) and top-down (atmospheric inversions) approaches to quantify the global net biogenic greenhouse gas balance between 1981 and 2010 resulting from anthropogenic activities and its effect on the climate system. We find that the cumulative warming capacity of concurrent biogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions is a factor of about two larger than the cooling effect resulting from the global land carbon dioxide uptake from 2001 to 2010. This results in a net positive cumulative impact of the three greenhouse gases on the planetary energy budget, with a best estimate (in petagrams of CO2 equivalent per year) of 3.9 ± 3.8 (top down) and 5.4 ± 4.8 (bottom up) based on the GWP100 metric (global warming potential on a 100-year time horizon). Our findings suggest that a reduction in agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions, particularly in Southern Asia, may help mitigate climate change."

https://openalex.org/W2301714492,"A gender-based disparity in physical activity (PA) among youth, whereby girls are less active than boys is a persistent finding in the literature. A greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying this difference has potential to guide PA intervention strategies.Data were collected at age 8 and 12 years (276 boys, 279 girls) from 29 schools as part of the LOOK study. Multilevel linear models were fitted separately for boys and girls to examine effects of individual, family and environmental level correlates on pedometer measured PA. Cardio-respiratory fitness (multi-stage run), percent fat (DEXA), eye-hand coordination (throw and catch test) and perceived competence in physical education (questionnaire) were used as individual level correlates. At the family level, parent's support and education (questionnaire) were used. School attended and extracurricular sport participation were included as environmental level correlates.Girls were 19% less active than boys (9420 vs 11360 steps/day, p<0.001, 95%CI [1844, 2626]). Lower PA among girls was associated with weaker influences at the school and family levels and through lower participation in extracurricular sport. School attended explained some of the variation in boys PA (8.4%) but not girls. Girls compared to boys had less favourable individual attributes associated with PA at age 8 years, including 18% lower cardio-respiratory fitness (3.5 vs 4.2, p<0.001, CI [0.5,0.9]), 44% lower eye-hand coordination (11.0 vs 17.3, p<0.001, CI [5.1,9.0]), higher percent body fat (28% vs 23%, p<0.001, CI [3.5,5.7]) and 9% lower perceived competence in physical education (7.7 vs 8.4, p<0.001, CI [0.2,0.9]). Participation in extracurricular sport at either age 8 or 12 years was protective against declines in PA over time among boys but not girls.Girls PA was less favourably influenced by socio-ecological factors at the individual, family, school and environmental levels. These factors are potentially modifiable suggesting the gap in PA between boys and girls can be reduced. Strategies aiming to increase PA should be multicomponent and take into consideration that pathways to increasing PA are likely to differ among boys and girls."

https://openalex.org/W2293843772,"Two-pore channels (TPCs) comprise a subfamily (TPC1-3) of eukaryotic voltage- and ligand-gated cation channels with two non-equivalent tandem pore-forming subunits that dimerize to form quasi-tetramers. Found in vacuolar or endolysosomal membranes, they regulate the conductance of sodium and calcium ions, intravesicular pH, trafficking and excitability. TPCs are activated by a decrease in transmembrane potential and an increase in cytosolic calcium concentrations, are inhibited by low luminal pH and calcium, and are regulated by phosphorylation. Here we report the crystal structure of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana at 2.87 Å resolution as a basis for understanding ion permeation, channel activation, the location of voltage-sensing domains and regulatory ion-binding sites. We determined sites of phosphorylation in the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains that are positioned to allosterically modulate cytoplasmic Ca(2+) activation. One of the two voltage-sensing domains (VSD2) encodes voltage sensitivity and inhibition by luminal Ca(2+) and adopts a conformation distinct from the activated state observed in structures of other voltage-gated ion channels. The structure shows that potent pharmacophore trans-Ned-19 (ref. 17) acts allosterically by clamping the pore domains to VSD2. In animals, Ned-19 prevents infection by Ebola virus and other filoviruses, presumably by altering their fusion with the endolysosome and delivery of their contents into the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2294819950,"TRPV4 ion channels function in epidermal keratinocytes and in innervating sensory neurons; however, the contribution of the channel in either cell to neurosensory function remains to be elucidated. We recently reported TRPV4 as a critical component of the keratinocyte machinery that responds to ultraviolet B (UVB) and functions critically to convert the keratinocyte into a pain-generator cell after excess UVB exposure. One key mechanism in keratinocytes was increased expression and secretion of endothelin-1, which is also a known pruritogen. Here we address the question of whether TRPV4 in skin keratinocytes functions in itch, as a particular form of “forefront” signaling in non-neural cells. Our results support this novel concept based on attenuated scratching behavior in response to histaminergic (histamine, compound 48/80, endothelin-1), not non-histaminergic (chloroquine) pruritogens in Trpv4 keratinocyte-specific and inducible knock-out mice. We demonstrate that keratinocytes rely on TRPV4 for calcium influx in response to histaminergic pruritogens. TRPV4 activation in keratinocytes evokes phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK, for histaminergic pruritogens. This finding is relevant because we observed robust anti-pruritic effects with topical applications of selective inhibitors for TRPV4 and also for MEK, the kinase upstream of ERK, suggesting that calcium influx via TRPV4 in keratinocytes leads to ERK-phosphorylation, which in turn rapidly converts the keratinocyte into an organismal itch-generator cell. In support of this concept we found that scratching behavior, evoked by direct intradermal activation of TRPV4, was critically dependent on TRPV4 expression in keratinocytes.

Neural pathways have been understood as key for itch, whereby specialized primary sensory pruriceptor neurons relay sensory afferent information to itch-transmitting neural pathways, ultimately evoking the sensation of itch (2.Dhand A.

Exogenous or endogenous pruritogens are thought to act on primary sensory neurons, producing the sensation of itch by activating the pruriceptors expressed by these afferents. Primary pruriceptor neurons may receive modulatory signals from atopic inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, and also from epidermal keratinocytes (7.Bautista D.M. Wilson S.R. Hoon M.A. Why we scratch an itch: the molecules, cells, and circuits of itch.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It was recently elucidated that the atopia cytokine, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), was secreted from skin keratinocytes to activate TRPA1 ion channels on primary pruriceptor neurons and induced itch (9.Wilson S.R.

Despite this landmark discovery, mechanisms of how the epidermal keratinocyte specifically functions to evoke itch remain largely unknown, especially mechanistic insights that rely on precise genetic targeting of genes-of-interest only in keratinocytes. In other words, molecular and cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms of forefront pruri-transduction are elusive. We recently defined a mechanism of how ultraviolet B (UVB) 3The abbreviations used are: UVBultraviolet BTRPV4transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid 4ET-1endothelin-1tamtamoxifen. radiation activates TRPV4 ion channels in skin epidermal keratinocytes (10.Moore C.

Their genetically encoded, inducible absence in skin keratinocytes suffices to contain pain and tissue damage evoked by UVB overexposure. In skin keratinocytes, TRPV4 activation by UVB is potentiated by endothelin-1 (ET-1) via endothelin receptors A and B. TRPV4-activation in these cells leads to Ca2+ influx, which in turn increases gene expression of ET-1, providing the substrate of a feed-forward mechanism that sustains organismal pain. This is an interesting observation in the context of itch because ET-1 injection into skin is known to cause itch in human subjects and evokes scratching behavior in experimental animals upon intradermal injection (11.Andoh T.

Except for the recent elucidation of the role of TRPV4 as ionotropic receptor for UVB in keratinocytes to reprogram these cells into organismal pain generators, its role in pain has been attributed to its expression in primary sensory neurons. ultraviolet B transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid 4 endothelin-1 tamoxifen. Against this background, especially the finding of TRPV4-dependent secretion of the pruritogen, ET-1, by keratinocytes, we felt that we have raised a timely question, namely whether TRPV4 plays a role in itch, in particular whether TRPV4 in keratinocytes of the epidermis can drive scratching behavior. To address this question we decided to first focus on acute itch and, specifically, as an initial priority, to examine prototypic examples of histaminergic itch, including ET-1-evoked itch, plus chloroquine-caused non-histaminergic itch. In this study we are reporting an exciting new function of TRPV4 in forefront signaling of the integument, namely that TRPV4 in epidermal keratinocytes functions as a pruriceptor-TRP channel in acute histaminergic itch, including itch evoked by ET-1, not in non-histaminergic itch evoked by chloroquine. Direct activation of TRPV4 channels also evokes scratching behavior, which appears completely dependent on TRPV4 expression in keratinocytes, thus underscoring the role of this cell and its expression of TRPV4 in itch. Complementing findings in our Trpv4 keratinocyte-specific inducible knock-out (Trpv4 cKO) mice, we demonstrate Ca2+ transients in response to histaminergic pruritogens in cultured primary keratinocytes that depend on TRPV4. Ca2+ influx via TRPV4 then up-regulates phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK in keratinocytes. Consequently, we find topical transdermal treatment with a selective inhibitor of TRPV4 to function efficiently as an anti-pruritogen. Moreover, we observed similar in vivo anti-pruritic effects when topically targeting MEK, upstream of ERK, with a selective inhibitor. The pan-null phenotype of Trpv4−/− mice relies on excision of the exon encoding transmembrane domains 5–6. Mice were outcrossed to C57BL/6J background and PCR-genotyped (10.Moore C. Cevikbas F.

All were dissolved in sterile normal saline except that GSK101 and GSK205 were dissolved in DMSO (20 mm in stock) and further diluted until use. Compounds GSK205 and U0126 were kept as DMSO stock, then diluted to 100 μm and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively, in 25% isopropyl alcohol, 15% ethanol, and 60% glycerol when used. Mice were shaved at the dorsal neck where intradermal injections and topical applications were applied. Mice were allowed to acclimate to a Plexiglas chamber for at least 30 min before testing and received intradermal injection of pruritogens (histamine, 500 μg/50 μl; 48/80, 100 μg/50 μl; ET-1, 25 ng/50 μl; chloroquine, 200 μg/50 μl) or saline through a 30-gauge needle into the nape of neck to elicit scratching behavior. After injection, mice were immediately placed back in the chamber, and the scratching behavior was recorded by a Panasonic video camera for a 30-min observation period. Hind limb scratching behavior directed toward the shaved area at the nape of neck was observed. One scratch is defined as a lifting of the hind limb toward the injection site and then a replacing of the limb back to the floor, regardless of how many scratching strokes take place between those two movements. Behavioral analysis was conducted by observers blinded to genotype. To investigate the topical effects of the specific TRPV4 inhibitor GSK205 or the specific MEK inhibitor U0126 on pruritogen-induced scratching behaviors, mice received a transdermal-topical application of 100 μl of formulated GSK205 (100 μm) or U0126 (0.1 mg/ml) on the shaved area at the nape of neck 20 min before pruritogen injections. Control animals received the same volume of placebo. Primary mouse keratinocytes were cultured following previous protocol (10.Moore C. Cevikbas F. Pasolli H.A. Chen Y. Kong W. Kempkes C. Parekh P.

The epidermis from the back skin of newborn WT mice (P0-P2) was separated from the dermis by floating the skin on 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) for 14–18 h at 4 °C. Basal keratinocytes were separated from the cornified sheets by filtration through a 70 μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Keratinocytes were plated on collagen-coated dishes or glass coverslips and grown in EME media (Gibco) supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and epidermal growth factor, 10% chelexed fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 pmol of cholera toxin (Calbiochem), and 1× antibiotics/antimycotics (Gibco) in an incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.

In brief, surgically discarded foreskin samples, obtained from Duke Children's Hospital in accordance to institutionally approved IRB protocol, were incubated with Dispase (Gibco, 4 units/ml) for 12–16 h at 4 °C followed by 0.05% trypsin (Gibco) for 10–20 min at 37 °C. Cells were grown and passaged in keratinocyte serum-free media (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and used at passage 2–3. Ca2+ imaging of primary epidermal keratinocytes in response to chemicals was conducted after loading with 2 μm fura2-AM (Invitrogen) for 30 min after a ratiometric Ca2+-imaging protocol with 340/380-nm blue light for dual excitation. Ratios of emissions were acquired at 0.5 Hz. ΔR/R0 was determined as the fraction of the increase of a given ratio over baseline ratio divided by baseline ratio. To investigate the effects of the specific TRPV4 inhibitors GSK205 or GSK219 on pruritogen-induced Ca2+ influx and pERK expression, cells were incubated with GSK205 or GSK219 for 15 min before stimulation.

Briefly, cultured keratinocytes and dissected dorsal skin (0.5 × 0.5 cm, the area that received the treatment) were protein-extracted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA, Sigma) buffer and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes after gel separation of proteins in a 4–15% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA (Sigma) in TBST, and pERK and ERK were specifically detected with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-pERK (catalog #9101) and anti-ERK (catalog #4695), both at 1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology), secondary antibody (anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated, 1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch), and chemiluminescence substrate (ECL-Advance, GE Healthcare). Abundance was quantified using ImagePro Plus software. β-Actin, as a control, was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1:4000; catalog #sc-47778, Santa Cruz) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1:4000; catalog #A5316, Sigma).

We report here that PqqE activity is dependent on the accessory protein PqqD, which was recently shown to bind PqqA tightly. In addition, PqqE activity in vitro requires the presence of a flavodoxin- and flavodoxin reductase-based reduction system, with other reductants leading to an uncoupled cleavage of the co-substrate SAM. These results indicate that PqqE, in conjunction with PqqD, carries out the first step in PQQ biosynthesis: a radical-mediated formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between two amino acid side chains on PqqA."

Their physiological activities are not determined by a simple coupling of stimulus and response, but depend critically on context, i.e. the interplay of receptors, ligands, and regulators that form the TGF-β signal transduction system of a cell or tissue. How these different components combine to regulate signaling activities remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a ligand-mediated mechanism of signaling regulation. Based on the observation that the type II TGF-β family receptors ActRIIA, ActRIIB, and BMPRII interact with a large group of overlapping ligands at overlapping epitopes, we hypothesized high affinity ligands compete with low affinity ligands for receptor binding and signaling. We show activin A and other high affinity ligands directly inhibited signaling by the low affinity ligands BMP-2, BMP-7, and BMP-9. We demonstrate activin A functions as a competitive inhibitor that blocks the ligand binding epitope on type II receptors. We propose binding competition and signaling antagonism are integral functions of the TGF-β signal transduction system. These functions could help explain how activin A modulates physiological signaling during extraordinary cellular responses, such as injury and wound healing, and how activin A could elicit disease phenotypes such as cancer-related muscle wasting and fibrosis.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family signaling pathways play fundamentally important roles in stem cell fate determination, embryonic development, organogenesis, immunity, and cancer (1.Moustakas A.

The basic principles underlying TGF-β family action are well established. A dimeric ligand binds two type I and two type II receptors to form a hexameric complex, thus initiating a signaling cascade that leads to phosphorylation of SMAD transcription factors, their translocation to the nucleus, and expression of target genes (4.Shi Y.

Although this simple mechanism completely describes the molecular basis of signaling and response, it fails to explain the complex and sometimes opposite responses elicited by many TGF-β family ligands. For example, some TGF-β family ligands can both inhibit and promote cell growth, maintain pluripotency, and induce differentiation, and both suppress and activate tumor cells. These paradoxical effects have supported the idea that cellular responses to a TGF-β family ligand depend not only on the ligand-induced signaling cascade but also on the cellular context, i.e. the molecular interplay of all the components that form the TGF-β signal transduction system of a particular cell type or tissue (10.Massagué J.

Instead, low affinity ligands use the same type II receptors as high affinity ligands. We therefore hypothesized high affinity ligands compete with low affinity ligands for type II receptor binding and antagonize low affinity ligand signaling. In this model, high affinity ligands can function both as signal carriers and as signaling regulators that mediate the biological activities of ligands that bind type II receptors with lower affinities. To test this hypothesis, we examined ligand-type II receptor binding and ligand signaling. Activins and activin-related ligands like GDF-8 and GDF-11 generally bound type II receptors with higher affinity than most BMPs and signaled via the SMAD2/3 pathway. By contrast, BMPs generally bound type II receptors with lower affinity and signaled via the SMAD1/5/8 pathway, as expected. Notably, high affinity ligands directly inhibited SMAD1/5/8 signaling by low affinity ligands, although they activated their canonical SMAD2/3 pathways. Cross-inhibition was not restricted to low affinity ligands. High affinity ligands also inhibited other high affinity ligands. Significantly, cross-inhibition could be prevented by blocking the activin A-type II receptor interaction but not by inhibiting the intracellular signal transduction pathway. These findings thus suggest cross-inhibition is due to competition for type II receptor binding. That ligands can act as antagonists has been suggested for BMP-3 (30.Piek E. Afrakhte M.

Shown in parentheses are the NCBI-protein accession numbers. Synthetic genes of human ActRIIA (P27037) and ActRIIB (Q13705) fused to human IgG1-Fc genes were obtained from GeneArt. Human BMPRII (Q13873) and TGFβRII (P37173) were cloned from cDNA (Open Biosystems) and fused to IgG1-Fc by PCR. Receptor-Fc fusion constructs included signal peptide and extracellular domains of human ActRIIA(1–120), ActRIIB(1–120), TGFβRII(1–166), or BMPRII(1–136). Extracellular domains were linked at the C terminus to human IgG1-Fc via a 22-amino acid-long linker containing a tobacco etch virus cleavage site. NCBI protein accession numbers are shown in parentheses. Proteins were expressed using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Secreted receptor-Fc fusion proteins were captured from condition medium using protein A affinity chromatography, eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0, and directly neutralized by adding 10% v/v 2 m Tris/HCl, pH 9.0. Purified proteins were either dialyzed directly into phosphate-buffered saline (AMRESCO), pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C or further purified by size exclusion chromatography in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C. Purity of receptor-Fc fusion proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions. All experiments were performed using BIAcore 2000 and carried out at 25 °C using HBS/EPS (0.01 m HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% BSA as running buffer. Experimental flow rate was 50 μl/min. For receptor capture, anti-human IgG (Fc) antibody was immobilized on four channels of a CM5 chip using amine-coupling chemistry. 250 response units (RU) of purified ActRIIA-Fc, ActRIIB-Fc, BMPRII-Fc, or TGFβRII-Fc were loaded on the experimental flow channels. A reference channel was monitored to account for nonspecific binding, drift, and bulk shifts. For ligand binding studies, different ligands at a concentration of 80 nm were injected, including activin A, activin B, GDF-1, GDF-8, GDF-11, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, BMP-2, BMP-3, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-9, BMP-10, and nodal. After each binding cycle, the antibody surface was regenerated to baseline by injecting MgCl2. For binding competition studies, anti-BMP-7 monoclonal antibody (MAB3542, R&D Systems) was immobilized on two channels of a CM5 chip using amine-coupling chemistry. 300 RU of purified BMP-7 were captured on the experimental flow channel. ActRIIA-Fc (12 nm) preincubated with different amounts of activin A was injected. After each binding cycle, the antibody-BMP-7 surface was regenerated to base line by injecting MgCl2. A-204 rhabdomyosarcoma cells (HTB-82) and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HB-8065) were obtained from the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). Cells were maintained according to standard ATCC culture conditions. Briefly, A-204 cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptavidin. HepG2 cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptavidin. Cells were grown at 37 °C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Freshly thawed cells were passaged at least three times before performing assays. A 40-μm cell strainer (Greiner Bio-one) was used to obtain a uniform single-cell suspension of HepG2 cells for plating. ∼50,000 A-204 or ∼10,000 HepG2 cells in complete medium were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate and grown overnight. For transfection, solutions containing 24 μl of Lipofectamine 2000, assay medium (960 μl growth medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA), 192 ng of pGL4.74 (Luc2P/hRluc/TK) vector (control luciferase reporter plasmid, Promega), and 19.2 μg of the SMAD3 responsive reporter plasmid pGL4.48 (luc2P/SBE) or the SMAD1/5/8 responsive reporter plasmid pGL3 (luc2P/BRE) were prepared and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After incubation, 3840 μl of assay medium was added to the transfection solutions, and 50 μl of this mixture were added to each well. Transfection medium was removed the following day, and medium was replaced with assay medium, which contained test proteins, including ligands (1–10 nm) and/or the receptor-Fc constructs (0–250 nm). Assay medium containing test proteins was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before adding to cells. After addition of medium, A-204 cells were incubated for 6 h, and HepG2 cells were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was detected using a homemade dual-glow luciferase assay (41.Baker J.M. Boyce F.M. High-throughput functional screening using a homemade dual-glow luciferase assay.J. Vis.

Relative luciferase units were calculated by dividing firefly luciferase units with Renilla luciferase units (RLU). Data are expressed as mean of four independent measurements. Error bars correspond to S.E. of four independent measurements. ∼8.0 × 104 HepG2 cells were plated in 12-well plates and grown to 80% confluence in complete medium, washed with 1× PBS, starved overnight in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA (assay medium), and grown for an additional 16 h in assay medium with or without treatment. After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, protein lysate was prepared by using ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1× “Recom Protease Arrest” protease inhibitor mixture (G-Biosciences) and 2× “Phosphatase Arrest” phosphastase inhibitor mixture (G-Biosciences). Cell lysates were stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration of lysates was determined using Bradford. For Western blot, equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were separated under reducing conditions on TGS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with primary antibodies from Cell Signaling at a 1:1000 dilution, including anti-phospho-SMAD2 (138D4), anti-SMAD2 (D43B4), anti-phospho-SMAD1/5 (41D10), anti-SMAD4 (9515), and anti-β-actin (8H10D10), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:2000 dilution (7074). Western Bright ECL HRP substrate was used for detection (Advansta). Western blots were visualized by exposing the gel to autoradiography film. Reporter gene assays were performed in quadruplicates and were repeated two to three different times. Statistical analysis was done with GraphPad Prism 6. To determine statistical significance for induction experiments (Fig. 2), one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's post hoc test were used. For inhibition experiments (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7), two-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc test were used. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

https://openalex.org/W2295736736,"Sorghum is an important C4 grain and grass crop used for food, feed, forage, sugar, and biofuels. In its native Africa, sorghum landraces often grow to approximately 3–4 meters in height. Following introduction into the U.S., shorter, early flowering varieties were identified and used for production of grain. Quinby and Karper identified allelic variation at four loci designated Dw1-Dw4 that regulated plant height by altering the length of stem internodes. The current study used a map-based cloning strategy to identify the gene corresponding to Dw1. Hegari (Dw1dw2Dw3dw4) and 80M (dw1dw2Dw3dw4) were crossed and F2 and HIF derived populations used for QTL mapping. Genetic analysis identified four QTL for internode length in this population, Dw1 on SBI-09, Dw2 on SBI-06, and QTL located on SBI-01 and SBI-07. The QTL on SBI-07 was ~3 Mbp upstream of Dw3 and interacted with Dw1. Dw1 was also found to contribute to the variation in stem weight in the population. Dw1 was fine mapped to an interval of ~33 kbp using HIFs segregating only for Dw1. A polymorphism in an exon of Sobic.009G229800 created a stop codon that truncated the encoded protein in 80M (dw1). This polymorphism was not present in Hegari (Dw1) and no other polymorphisms in the delimited Dw1 locus altered coding regions. The recessive dw1 allele found in 80M was traced to Dwarf Yellow Milo, the progenitor of grain sorghum genotypes identified as dw1. Dw1 encodes a putative membrane protein of unknown function that is highly conserved in plants."

Many wild relatives of the genus Camellia that are closely related to C. sinensis are native to Southwest China. In this study, we first identified the distinct genetic divergence between C. sinensis and its wild relatives and provided a glimpse into the artificial selection of tea plants at a genome-wide level by analyzing 15,444 genomic SNPs that were identified from 18 cultivated and wild tea accessions using a high-throughput genome-wide restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) approach. Six distinct clusters were detected by phylogeny inferrence and principal component and genetic structural analyses, and these clusters corresponded to six Camellia species/varieties. Genetic divergence apparently indicated that C. taliensis var. bangwei is a semi-wild or transient landrace occupying a phylogenetic position between those wild and cultivated tea plants. Cultivated accessions exhibited greater heterozygosity than wild accessions, with the exception of C. taliensis var. bangwei. Thirteen genes with non-synonymous SNPs exhibited strong selective signals that were suggestive of putative artificial selective footprints for tea plants during domestication. The genome-wide SNPs provide a fundamental data resource for assessing genetic relationships, characterizing complex traits, comparing heterozygosity and analyzing putatitve artificial selection in tea plants."

https://openalex.org/W2294623288,"FGF-21 is a key regulator of metabolism and potential drug candidate for the treatment of type II diabetes and other metabolic disorders. However, the half-life of active, circulating, human FGF-21 has recently been shown to be limited in mice and monkeys by a proteolytic cleavage between P171 and S172. Here, we show that fibroblast activation protein is the enzyme responsible for this proteolysis by demonstrating that purified FAP cleaves human FGF-21 at this site in vitro, and that an FAP-specific inhibitor, ARI-3099, blocks the activity in mouse, monkey and human plasma and prolongs the half-life of circulating human FGF-21 in mice. Mouse FGF-21, however, lacks the FAP cleavage site and is not cleaved by FAP. These findings indicate FAP may function in the regulation of metabolism and that FAP inhibitors may prove useful in the treatment of diabetes and metabolic disorders in humans, but pre-clinical proof of concept studies in rodents will be problematic."

A yeast two-hybrid screen identified a new candidate Nav1.5-interacting protein, αB-crystallin. GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunostaining analyses validated the interaction between Nav1.5 and αB-crystallin. Whole-cell patch clamping showed that overexpression of αB-crystallin significantly increased peak sodium current (INa) density, and the underlying molecular mechanism is the increased cell surface expression level of Nav1.5 via reduced internalization of cell surface Nav1.5 and ubiquitination of Nav1.5. Knock-out of αB-crystallin expression significantly decreased the cell surface expression level of Nav1.5. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that αB-crystallin interacted with Nedd4-2; however, a catalytically inactive Nedd4-2-C801S mutant impaired the interaction and abolished the up-regulation of INa by αB-crystallin. Nav1.5 mutation V1980A at the interaction site for Nedd4-2 eliminated the effect of αB-crystallin on reduction of Nav1.5 ubiquitination and increases of INa density.

https://openalex.org/W2293424103,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous non-coding RNAs that regulate metabolic processes, including obesity. The levels of circulating miRNAs are affected by metabolic changes in obesity, as well as in diet-induced weight loss. Circulating miRNAs are transported by high-density lipoproteins (HDL) but the regulation of HDL-associated miRNAs after diet-induced weight loss has not been studied. We aim to determine if HDL-associated miR-16, miR-17, miR-126, miR-222 and miR-223 levels are altered by diet-induced weight loss in overweight and obese males.HDL were isolated from 47 subjects following 12 weeks weight loss comparing a high protein diet (HP, 30% of energy) with a normal protein diet (NP, 20% of energy). HDL-associated miRNAs (miR-16, miR-17, miR-126, miR-222 and miR-223) at baseline and after 12 weeks of weight loss were quantified by TaqMan miRNA assays. HDL particle sizes were determined by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Serum concentrations of human HDL constituents were measured immunoturbidometrically or enzymatically.miR-16, miR-17, miR-126, miR-222 and miR-223 were present on HDL from overweight and obese subjects at baseline and after 12 weeks of the HP and NP weight loss diets. The HP diet induced a significant decrease in HDL-associated miR-223 levels (p = 0.015), which positively correlated with changes in body weight (r = 0.488, p = 0.032). Changes in miR-223 levels were not associated to changes in HDL composition or size.HDL-associated miR-223 levels are significantly decreased after HP diet-induced weight loss in overweight and obese males.

The novel strain P3B162T possesses plant growth beneficial traits such as positive growth on 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), production of indole acetic acid (IAA) and siderophore. In addition, it also showed important phenotypic characters such as ability to form biofilm and utilization of various components of plant root exudates (sugars, amino acids and organic acids), clearly indicating its lifestyle as a plant rhizosphere associated bacterium. Taxonomically, the novel strain P3B162T was affiliated to the genus Arthrobacter based on the collective results of phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic analyses. Moreover, molecular analysis using 16S rRNA gene showed Arthrobacter globiformis NBRC 12137T, Arthrobacter pascens DSM 20545T and Arthrobacter liuii DSXY973T as the closely related phylogenetic neighbours, showing more than 98% 16S rRNA similarity values, whereas the recA gene analysis displayed Arthrobacter liuii JCM 19864T as the nearest neighbour with 94.7% sequence similarity and only 91.7% to Arthrobacter globiformis LMG 3813T and 88.7% to Arthrobacter pascens LMG 16255T. However, the DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain P3B162T, Arthrobacter globiformis LMG 3813T, Arthrobacter pascens LMG 16255T and Arthrobacter liuii JCM 19864T was below 50%. In addition, the novel strain P3B162T can be distinguished from its closely related type strains by several phenotypic characters such as colony pigment, tolerance to NaCl, motility, reduction of nitrate, hydrolysis of DNA, acid from sucrose, cell wall sugars and cell wall peptidoglycan structure. In conclusion, the combined results of this study support the classification of strain P3B162T as a novel Arthrobacter species and we propose Arthrobacter pokkalii sp.nov.as its name. The type strain is P3B162T (= KCTC 29498T = MTCC 12358T)."
https://openalex.org/W2293774405,"Treatment of Staphylococcus aureus in stationary growth phase with high doses of the antibiotic daptomycin (DAP) eradicates the vast majority of the culture and leaves persister cells behind. Despite resting in a drug-tolerant and dormant state, persister cells exhibit metabolic activity which might be exploited for their elimination. We here report that the addition of glucose to S. aureus persisters treated with DAP increased killing by up to five-fold within one hour. This glucose-DAP effect also occurred with strains less sensitive to the drug. The underlying mechanism is independent of the proton motive force and was not observed with non-metabolizable 2-deoxy-glucose. Our results are consistent with two hypotheses on the glucose-DAP interplay. The first is based upon glucose-induced carbohydrate transport proteins that may influence DAP and the second suggests that glucose may trigger the release or activity of cell-lytic proteins to augment DAP’s mode of action."
https://openalex.org/W2296385367,"The focus of this study is the anti-cancer effects of Cudrania tricuspidata stem (CTS) extract on cervical cancer cells. The effect of CTS on cell viability was investigated in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells and HaCaT human normal keratinocytes. CTS showed significant dose-dependent cytotoxic effects in cervical cancer cells. However, there was no cytotoxic effect of CTS on HaCaT keratinocytes at concentrations of 0.125–0.5 mg/mL. Based on this cytotoxic effect, we demonstrated that CTS induced apoptosis by down-regulating the E6 and E7 viral oncogenes. Apoptosis was detected by DAPI staining, annexin V-FITC/PI staining, cell cycle analysis, western blotting, RT-PCR, and JC-1 staining in SiHa cervical cancer cells. The mRNA expression levels of extrinsic pathway molecules such as Fas, death receptor 5 (DR5), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) were increased by CTS. Furthermore, CTS treatment activated caspase-3/caspase-8 and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). However, the mitochondrial membrane potential and expression levels of intrinsic pathway molecules such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and cytochrome C were not modulated by CTS. Taken together, these results indicate that CTS induced apoptosis by activating the extrinsic pathway, but not the intrinsic pathway, in SiHa cervical cancer cells. These results suggest that CTS can be used as a modulating agent in cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2294261804,"Proteinase 3 (PR3), the autoantigen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, is expressed at the plasma membrane of resting neutrophils, and this membrane expression increases during both activation and apoptosis. Using surface plasmon resonance and protein-lipid overlay assays, this study demonstrates that PR3 is a phosphatidylserine-binding protein and this interaction is dependent on the hydrophobic patch responsible for membrane anchorage. Molecular simulations suggest that PR3 interacts with phosphatidylserine via a small number of amino acids, which engage in long lasting interactions with the lipid heads. As phosphatidylserine is a major component of microvesicles (MVs), this study also examined the consequences of this interaction on MV production and function. PR3-expressing cells produced significantly fewer MVs during both activation and apoptosis, and this reduction was dependent on the ability of PR3 to associate with the membrane as mutating the hydrophobic patch restored MV production. Functionally, activation-evoked MVs from PR3-expressing cells induced a significantly larger respiratory burst in human neutrophils compared with control MVs. Conversely, MVs generated during apoptosis inhibited the basal respiratory burst in human neutrophils, and those generated from PR3-expressing cells hampered this inhibition. Given that membrane expression of PR3 is increased in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, MVs generated from neutrophils expressing membrane PR3 may potentiate oxidative damage of endothelial cells and promote the systemic inflammation observed in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2296687919,"Blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity has been a primary therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). As patients with wild-type EGFR have demonstrated only modest benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), there is a need for additional therapeutic approaches in patients with wild-type EGFR. As a key component of downstream integrin signalling and known receptor cross-talk with EGFR, we hypothesized that targeting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity, which has also been shown to correlate with aggressive stage in NSCLC, would lead to enhanced activity of EGFR TKIs. As such, EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells (A549, H1299, H1975) were treated with the EGFR TKI erlotinib and FAK inhibitors (PF-573,228 or PF-562,271) both as single agents and in combination. We determined cell viability, apoptosis and 3-dimensional growth in vitro and assessed tumor growth in vivo. Treatment of EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells with FAK inhibitor alone effectively inhibited cell viability in all cell lines tested; however, its use in combination with the EGFR TKI erlotinib was more effective at reducing cell viability than either treatment alone when tested in both 2- and 3-dimensional assays in vitro, with enhanced benefit seen in A549 cells. This increased efficacy may be due in part to the observed inhibition of Akt phosphorylation when the drugs were used in combination, where again A549 cells demonstrated the most inhibition following treatment with the drug combination. Combining erlotinib with FAK inhibitor was also potent in vivo as evidenced by reduced tumor growth in the A549 mouse xenograft model. We further ascertained that the enhanced sensitivity was irrespective of the LKB1 mutational status. In summary, we demonstrate the effectiveness of combining erlotinib and FAK inhibitors for use in known EGFR wild-type, EGFR TKI resistant cells, with the potential that a subset of cell types, which includes A549, could be particularly sensitive to this combination treatment. As such, further evaluation of this combination therapy is warranted and could prove to be an effective therapeutic approach for patients with inherent EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC."

Testing of compounds isolated from this extract in turn led to the identification of Englerin A (EA) as the active constituent of the extract. EA induced both necrosis and apoptosis in Ewing cells subsequent to a G2M accumulation of cells in the cell cycle. It also impacted clonogenic survival and anchorage-independent proliferation while also decreasing the proportion of chemotherapy-resistant cells identified by high ALDH activity. EA also caused a sustained increase in cytosolic calcium levels. EA appears to exert its effect on Ewing cells through a decrease in phosphorylation of EWS-FLI1 and its ability to bind DNA. This effect is mediated, at least in part, through a decrease in the levels of the calcium-dependent protein kinase PKC-βI after a transient up-regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2294757058,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal rapidly progressive α-synucleinopathy, characterized by α-synuclein accumulation in oligodendrocytes. It is accepted that the pathological α-synuclein accumulation in the brain of MSA patients plays a leading role in the disease process, but little is known about the events in the early stages of the disease. In this study we aimed to define potential roles of the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in the early pre-motor stages of the disease, i.e., downstream of α-synuclein accumulation in oligodendroglia, as assessed in a transgenic mouse model of MSA. We investigated the expression patterns of miRNAs and their mRNA targets in substantia nigra (SN) and striatum, two brain regions that undergo neurodegeneration at a later stage in the MSA model, by microarray and RNA-seq analysis, respectively. Analysis was performed at a time point when α-synuclein accumulation was already present in oligodendrocytes at neuropathological examination, but no neuronal loss nor deficits of motor function had yet occurred. Our data provide a first evidence for the leading role of gene dysregulation associated with deficits in immune and inflammatory responses in the very early, non-symptomatic disease stages of MSA. While dysfunctional homeostasis and oxidative stress were prominent in SN in the early stages of MSA, in striatum differential gene expression in the non-symptomatic phase was linked to oligodendroglial dysfunction, disturbed protein handling, lipid metabolism, transmembrane transport and altered cell death control, respectively. A large number of putative miRNA-mRNAs interaction partners were identified in relation to the control of these processes in the MSA model. Our results support the role of early changes in the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in the pathogenesis of MSA preceding the clinical onset of the disease. The findings thus contribute to understanding the disease process and are likely to pave the way towards identifying disease biomarkers for early diagnosis of MSA."
https://openalex.org/W2299522440,"Adaptation, as a strategy to respond to climate change, has limits: there are conditions under which adaptation strategies fail to alleviate impacts from climate change. Research has primarily focused on identifying absolute bio-physical limits. This paper contributes empirical insight to an emerging literature on the social limits to adaptation. Such limits arise from the ways in which societies perceive, experience and respond to climate change. Using qualitative data from multi-stakeholder workshops and key-informant interviews with representatives of the fisheries and tourism sectors of the Great Barrier Reef region, we identify psycho-social and structural limits associated with key adaptation strategies, and examine how these are perceived as more or less absolute across levels of organisation. We find that actors experience social limits to adaptation when: i) the effort of pursuing a strategy exceeds the benefits of desired adaptation outcomes; ii) the particular strategy does not address the actual source of vulnerability, and; iii) the benefits derived from adaptation are undermined by external factors. We also find that social limits are not necessarily more absolute at higher levels of organisation: respondents perceived considerable opportunities to address some psycho-social limits at the national-international interface, while they considered some social limits at the local and regional levels to be effectively absolute."
https://openalex.org/W2293720901,"Acupuncture is a potential conservative therapy for women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). There is limited evidence to support its effectiveness due to the poor quality of existing studies.We performed a pilot randomized, controlled trial to preliminarily assess the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) in women with pure SUI. A total of 80 women with pure SUI were randomly assigned to receive EA with deep needling at BL33 and BL35 (n = 40) or sham EA with non-penetrating needling at sham acupoints (n = 40) three sessions per week for 6 weeks. The women were followed for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the amount of urine leakage measured by a 1-hour pad test after 6 weeks. The secondary outcomes included the 72-hour incontinence episode frequency (IEF), International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) score, and patient self-evaluation of therapeutic effect. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the trial.The median decrease from baseline of urine leakage measured by the 1-hour pad test was 2.5 g [interquartile range (IQR): 1.80-14.6 in the EA group, which was greater than the median decrease of 0.05 g (IQR: -2.80-+0.50) in the sham EA group after 6 weeks (p<0.01). The differences between groups in the decrease from baseline of 72-hour IEF became statistically significant at week 30 with a median decrease of 3.25 g (IQR: 1.25-5.69) in the EA group, and a median decrease of 1.00 g (IQR: -0.69-+2.88) in the sham EA group (p = 0.01). The participants in the EA group showed greater decreases in ICIQ-SF score and higher ratings in the help they received from the treatment than those in the sham EA group at weeks 6,18 and 30 (all p<0.05). No obvious AEs were observed in either group.EA may effectively and safely relieve urinary incontinence symptoms and improve quality of life in women with pure SUI. EA demonstrated more than a placebo effect. Since this is a pilot study, results should be interpreted with caution.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02445573."

The O-GlcNAc cycle is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). O-GlcNAcylation plays important role in many vital cellular events including transcription, cell cycle regulation, stress response and protein degradation, and altered O-GlcNAcylation has long been implicated in cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, numerous approaches have been developed to identify OGT substrates and study their function, but there is still a strong demand for highly efficient techniques. Here we demonstrated the utility of the peptide microarray approach to discover novel OGT substrates and study its specificity. Interestingly, the protein RBL-2, which is a key regulator of entry into cell division and may function as a tumor suppressor, was identified as a substrate for three isoforms of OGT. Using peptide Ala scanning, we found Ser 420 is one possible O-GlcNAc site in RBL-2. Moreover, substitution of Ser 420, on its own, inhibited OGT activity, raising the possibility of mechanism-based development for selective OGT inhibitors. This approach will prove useful for both discovery of novel OGT substrates and studying OGT specificity."

The aim of this study was to study the feasibility of this method.We studied the feasibility of a five-day period of ESM in PD and its ability to objectify diurnal fluctuations in motor symptom severity and their relation with affect and contextual factors in five PD patients with motor fluctuations.Participants achieved a high compliance, with 84% of assessment moments completed without disturbance of daily activities. The utility of the device was rated 8 on a 10-point scale. We were able to capture extensive diurnal fluctuations that were not revealed by routine clinical assessment. In addition, we were able to detect clinically relevant associations between motor symptoms, emotional fluctuations and contextual factors at an intra-individual level.ESM represents a viable and novel approach to elucidate relationships between motor symptoms, affective states and contextual factors at the level of individual subjects. ESM holds promise for clinical practice and scientific research."
https://openalex.org/W2293323856,"The signaling molecule cAMP regulates functions ranging from bacterial transcription to mammalian memory. In mammals, cAMP is synthesized by nine transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (ACs) and one soluble AC (sAC). Despite similarities in their catalytic domains, these ACs differ in regulation. Transmembrane ACs respond to G proteins, whereas sAC is uniquely activated by bicarbonate. Via bicarbonate regulation, sAC acts as a physiological sensor for pH/bicarbonate/CO2, and it has been implicated as a therapeutic target, e.g. for diabetes, glaucoma, and a male contraceptive. Here we identify the bisphenols bithionol and hexachlorophene as potent, sAC-specific inhibitors. Inhibition appears mostly non-competitive with the substrate ATP, indicating that they act via an allosteric site. To analyze the interaction details, we solved a crystal structure of an sAC·bithionol complex. The structure reveals that the compounds are selective for sAC because they bind to the sAC-specific, allosteric binding site for the physiological activator bicarbonate. Structural comparison of the bithionol complex with apo-sAC and other sAC·ligand complexes along with mutagenesis experiments reveals an allosteric mechanism of inhibition; the compound induces rearrangements of substrate binding residues and of Arg(176), a trigger between the active site and allosteric site. Our results thus provide 1) novel insights into the communication between allosteric regulatory and active sites, 2) a novel mechanism for sAC inhibition, and 3) pharmacological compounds targeting this allosteric site and utilizing this mode of inhibition. These studies provide support for the future development of sAC-modulating drugs."

The DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities and antiproliferative effect of PCG were lower than those of catechin, while PCG had higher CAA activity than catechin. In addition, PCG had very high α-glucosidase inhibitory activities (IC50 value, 2.59 μg/mL) in comparison to catechin (IC50 value, 239.27 μg/mL). Inhibition kinetics suggested that both PCG and catechin demonstrated a mixture of noncompetitive and anticompetitive inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2300503766,"The cyclin B/CDK1 complex is a key regulator of mitotic entry. Using PP242, a specific ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTOR kinase, we provide evidence that the mTOR signalling pathway controls cyclin B mRNA translation following fertilization in Sphaerechinus granularis and Paracentrotus lividus. We show that PP242 inhibits the degradation of the cap-dependent translation repressor 4E-BP (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-Binding Protein). PP242 inhibits global protein synthesis, delays cyclin B accumulation, cyclin B/CDK1 complex activation and consequently entry into the mitotic phase of the cell cycle triggered by fertilization. PP242 inhibits cyclin B mRNA recruitment into active polysomes triggered by fertilization. An amount of cyclin B mRNA present in active polysomes appears to be insensitive to PP242 treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that, following sea urchin egg fertilization, cyclin B mRNA translation is controlled by two independent mechanisms: a PP242-sensitive and an additional PP242-insentitive mechanism."

Shedding of IL-23R was induced by stimulation with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but not by ionomycin.

https://openalex.org/W2296102999,"The genetic profile of human pancreatic cancers harbors considerable heterogeneity, which suggests a possible explanation for the pronounced inefficacy of single therapies in this disease. This observation has led to a belief that custom therapies based on individual tumor profiles are necessary to more effectively treat pancreatic cancer. It has recently been discovered that axon guidance genes are affected by somatic structural variants in up to 25% of human pancreatic cancers. Thus far, however, some of these mutations have only been correlated to survival probability and no function has been assigned to these observed axon guidance gene mutations in pancreatic cancer. In this study we established three novel pancreatic cancer cell lines and performed whole genome sequencing to discover novel mutations in axon guidance genes that may contribute to the cancer phenotype of these cells. We discovered, among other novel somatic variants in axon guidance pathway genes, a novel mutation in the PLXNA1 receptor (c.2587G>A) in newly established cell line SB.06 that mediates oncogenic cues of increased invasion and proliferation in SB.06 cells and increased invasion in 293T cells upon stimulation with the receptor’s natural ligand semaphorin 3A compared to wild type PLXNA1 cells. Mutant PLXNA1 signaling was associated with increased Rho-GTPase and p42/p44 MAPK signaling activity and cytoskeletal expansion, but not changes in E-cadherin, vimentin, or metalloproteinase 9 expression levels. Pharmacologic inhibition of the Rho-GTPase family member CDC42 selectively abrogated PLXNA1 c.2587G>A-mediated increased invasion. These findings provide in-vitro confirmation that somatic mutations in axon guidance genes can provide oncogenic gain-of-function signals and may contribute to pancreatic cancer progression."

Recently, two single nucleotide SLC6A2 polymorphisms, G1287A in exon 9 and T-182C in the promoter region, were found to be associated with MDD in different populations. We investigated the relationship between the brain volume and these two polymorphisms of the SLC6A2 in MDD patients. Methods We obtained 3D high-resolution T1-weighted images of 30 first-episode MDD patients and 48 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (HS). All were divided into 4 groups based on polymorphism of either the G1287A or the T-182C genotype. VBM analysis examined the effects of diagnosis, genotype, and genotype-diagnosis interactions. Results Diagnosis effects on the brain morphology were found in the left superior temporal cortex. No significant genotype effects were found in the T-182C and the G1287A. A significant genotype (G1287A)–diagnosis interaction was found in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. No significant genotype (T-182C)–diagnosis interaction effects were observed in any brain region. Conclusions In MDD patients there seems to be a relationship between the volume of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and polymorphism of the SLC6A2 G1287A gene."
https://openalex.org/W2296367488,"Nascent polypeptides are degraded by the proteasome concurrently with their synthesis on the ribosome. This process, called cotranslational protein degradation (CTPD), has been observed for years, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Equally unclear are the identities of cellular proteins genuinely subjected to CTPD. Here we report the identification of CTPD substrates in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae via a quantitative proteomic analysis. We compared the abundance of individual ribosome-bound nascent chains between a wild type strain and a mutant defective in CTPD. Of 1,422 proteins acquired from the proteomic analysis, 289 species are efficient CTPD substrates, with >30% of their nascent chains degraded cotranslationally. We found that proteins involved in translation, ribosome biogenesis, nuclear transport, and amino acid metabolism are more likely to be targeted for CTPD. There is a strong correlation between CTPD and the translation efficiency. CTPD occurs preferentially to rapidly translated polypeptides. CTPD is also influenced by the protein sequence length; longer polypeptides are more susceptible to CTPD. In addition, proteins with N-terminal disorder have a higher probability of being degraded cotranslationally. Interestingly, the CTPD efficiency is not related to the half-lives of mature proteins. These results for the first time indicate an inverse correlation between CTPD and cotranslational folding on a proteome scale. The implications of this study with respect to the physiological significance of CTPD are discussed."

Nanobodies have great potential for gene therapy application due to their single-gene nature. Historically, Mycoplasma hominis has not been considered pathogenic bacteria due to the lack of acute infection and partially due to multiple studies demonstrating high frequency of isolation of M. hominis samples from asymptomatic patients. However, recent studies on the role of latent M. hominis infection in oncologic transformation, especially prostate cancer, and reports that M. hominis infects Trichomonas and confers antibiotic resistance to Trichomonas, have generated new interest in this field. In the present study we have generated specific nanobody against M. hominis (aMh), for which the identified target is the ABC-transporter substrate-binding protein. aMh exhibits specific antibacterial action against M. hominis. In an attempt to improve the therapeutic properties, we have developed the adenoviral vector-based gene therapy approach for passive immunization with nanobodies against M. hominis. For better penetration into the mucous layer of the genital tract, we fused aMh with the Fc-fragment of IgG. Application of this comprehensive approach with a single systemic administration of recombinant adenovirus expressing aMh-Fc demonstrated both prophylactic and therapeutic effects in a mouse model of genital M. hominis infection."
https://openalex.org/W2294549389,"This paper presents a novel secure and robust steganographic technique in the compressed video domain namely embedding-based byte differencing (EBBD). Unlike most of the current video steganographic techniques which take into account only the intra frames for data embedding, the proposed EBBD technique aims to hide information in both intra and inter frames. The information is embedded into a compressed video by simultaneously manipulating the quantized AC coefficients (AC-QTCs) of luminance components of the frames during MPEG-2 encoding process. Later, during the decoding process, the embedded information can be detected and extracted completely. Furthermore, the EBBD basically deals with two security concepts: data encryption and data concealing. Hence, during the embedding process, secret data is encrypted using the simplified data encryption standard (S-DES) algorithm to provide better security to the implemented system. The security of the method lies in selecting candidate AC-QTCs within each non-overlapping 8 × 8 sub-block using a pseudo random key. Basic performance of this steganographic technique verified through experiments on various existing MPEG-2 encoded videos over a wide range of embedded payload rates. Overall, the experimental results verify the excellent performance of the proposed EBBD with a better trade-off in terms of imperceptibility and payload, as compared with previous techniques while at the same time ensuring minimal bitrate increase and negligible degradation of PSNR values."

Our preliminary microarray studies show that clusterin was prominently upregulated in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) overexpressing GATA-4 (MSCGATA-4). We hypothesized that the upregulation of clusterin is involved in overexpression of GATA-4 mediated cytoprotection. Methods MSCs harvested from bone marrow of rats were transduced with GATA-4. The expression of clusterin in MSCs was further confirmed by real-time PCR and western blotting. Simulation of ischemia was achieved by exposure of MSCs to a hypoxic environment. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released from MSCs was served as a biomarker of cell injury and MTs uptake was used to estimate cell viability. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and caspase 3/7 activity. Results (1) Clusterin expression was up-regulated in MSCGATA-4 compared to control MSCs transfected with empty-vector (MSCNull). MSCGATA-4 were tolerant to 72 h hypoxia exposure as shown by reduced LDH release and higher MTs uptake. This protection was abrogated by transfecting Clu-siRNA into MSCGATA-4. (2) Exogenous clusterin significantly decreased LDH release and increased MSC survival in hypoxic environment. Moreover, ΔΨm was maintained and caspase 3/7 activity was reduced by clusterin in a concentration-dependent manner. (3) p-Akt expression in MSCs was upregulated following pre-treatment with clusterin, with no change in total Akt. Moreover, cytoprotection mediated by clusterin was partially abrogated by Akt inhibitor LY294002. Conclusions Clusterin/Akt signaling pathway is involved in GATA-4 mediated cytoprotection against hypoxia stress. It is suggested that clusterin may be therapeutically exploited in MSC based therapy for cardiovascular diseases."

Alternative splicing generates two different regions that connect the protease-resistant catalytic domains. Inclusion of exon 16 introduces a pair of Lys residues, providing a site for controlled endoproteolytic cleavage of PAM and the separation of soluble peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase from membrane-associated PAL. Exon 16 also includes two O-glycosylation sites. PAM-1 lacking both glycosylation sites (PAM-1/OSX; where OSX is O-glycan-depleted mutant of PAM-1) was stably expressed in AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells. In PAM-1/OSX, a cleavage site for furin-like convertases was exposed, generating a shorter form of membrane-associated PAL. The endocytic trafficking of PAM-1/OSX differed dramatically from that of PAM-1. A soluble fragment of the cytosolic domain of PAM-1 was produced in the endocytic pathway and entered the nucleus; very little soluble fragment of the cytosolic domain was produced from PAM-1/OSX. Internalized PAM-1/OSX was rapidly degraded; unlike PAM-1, very little internalized PAM-1/OSX was detected in multivesicular bodies. Blue native PAGE analysis identified high molecular weight complexes containing PAM-1; the ability of PAM-1/OSX to form similar complexes was markedly diminished. By promoting the formation of high molecular weight complexes, O-glycans may facilitate the recycling of PAM-1 through the endocytic compartment.

https://openalex.org/W2296601338,"Adequate utilization of services is critical to maximize the impact of counselling on infant and young child feeding (IYCF), but little is known about factors affecting utilization. Our study examined supply- and demand-side factors associated with the utilization of IYCF counselling services in Viet Nam. We used survey data from mothers with children <2y (n = 1,008) and health staff (n = 60) from the evaluation of a program that embedded IYCF counseling into the existing government health system. The frequency of never users, one-time users, repeat users, and achievers of the recommended minimum number of visits at health facilities were 45.1%, 13.0%, 28.4% and 13.5%, respectively. Poisson regression showed that demand-generation strategies, especially invitation cards, were the key factors determining one-time use (Prevalence ratio, PR 3.0, 95% CI: 2.2–4.2), repeated use (PR 3.2, 95% CI: 2.4–4.2), and achievement of minimum visits (PR 5.5, 95% CI: 3.6–8.4). Higher maternal education was associated with higher utilization both for one-time and repeated use. Being a farmer, belonging to an ethnic minority, and having a wasted child were associated with greater likelihood of achieving the minimum recommended number of visits, whereas child stunting or illness were not. Distance to health center was a barrier to repeated visits. Among supply-side factors, good counselling skills (PR: 1.3–1.8) was the most important factor associated with any service use, whereas longer employment duration and greater work pressure of health center staff were associated with lower utilization. Population attributable risk estimations showed that an additional 25% of the population would have achieved the minimum number of visits if exposed to three demand-generation strategies, and further increased to 49% if the health staff had good counseling skills and low work pressure. Our study provides evidence that demand-generation strategies are essential to increase utilization of facility-based IYCF counselling services in Viet Nam, and may be relevant for increasing and sustaining use of nutrition services in similar contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2294768430,"Onscreen Smoking Is a Form of Tobacco Marketing Tobacco advertising has been prohibited in New Zealand since 1990, and the government has set a goal of becoming a smokefree nation by 2025. However, tobacco marketing persists indirectly through smoking in motion pictures, and there is strong evidence that exposure to onscreen smoking causes young people to start smoking. We investigated the relationship between exposure to smoking in movies and youth smoking initiation among New Zealand young adults. Data from an online survey of 419 smokers and non-smokers aged 18 to 25 were used to estimate respondents’ exposure to smoking occurrences in 50 randomly-selected movies from the 423 US top box office movies released between 2008 and 2012. Analyses involved calculating movie smoking exposure (MSE) for each respondent, using logistic regression to analyse the relationship between MSE and current smoking behaviour, and estimating the attributable fraction due to smoking in movies. Effect of Smoking in Movies on New Zealand Youth Exposure to smoking occurrences in movies was associated with current smoking status. After allowing for the influence of family, friends and co-workers, age and rebelliousness, respondents’ likelihood of smoking increased by 11% for every 100-incident increase in exposure to smoking incidents, (aOR1.11; p< .05). The estimated attributable fraction due to smoking in movies was 54%; this risk could be substantially reduced by eliminating smoking from movies currently rated as appropriate for youth. We conclude that exposure to smoking in movies remains a potent risk factor associated with smoking among young adults, even in a progressive tobacco control setting such as New Zealand. Harmonising the age of legal tobacco purchase (18) with the age at which it is legal to view smoking in movies would support New Zealand’s smokefree 2025 goal."
https://openalex.org/W2293804145,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) as an environmental disease is largely influenced by accumulated epithelial stress from diverse environmental causes. We are exposed to ribosome-related insults, including ribosome-inactivating stress (RIS), from the environment, dietary factors, and medicines, but their physiological impacts on the chemotherapy of CRC are not yet understood. Here we revealed the effects of RIS on chemosensitivity and other malignancy-related properties of CRC cells. First, RIS led to bidirectional inhibition of p53-macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1)-mediated death responses in response to anticancer drugs by either enhancing ATF3-linked antiapoptotic signaling or intrinsically inhibiting MIC-1 and p53 expression, regardless of ATF3. Second, RIS enhanced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and biogenesis of cancer stem-like cells in an ATF3-dependent manner. These findings indicate that gastrointestinal exposure to RIS interferes with the efficacy of chemotherapeutics, mechanistically implying that ATF3-linked malignancy and chemoresistance can be novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of environmentally aggravated cancers.

https://openalex.org/W2295182112,"As part of an effort to profile potential therapeutics for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases, a diversity of amide-linked small molecules was synthesized by using parallel synthesis strategy. Moreover, these new compounds were also evaluated for their inhibitory effects on nitric oxide (NO) by using tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-induced inflammatory responses in chondrocytes. Among the tested compounds, N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide (HS-Ck) was the most potent inhibitor of NO production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in TNF-α-stimulated chondrocytes. In addition, our biological results indicated that HS-Ck might suppress the expression levels of iNOS and matrix metalloproteinases-13 (MMP-13) activities through downregulating the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) transcriptional factors. Therefore, the parallel synthesis was successful used to develop a new class of potential anti-inflammatory agents as chondroprotective candidates for the treatment of osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W1875540562,"Information transmission in cells occurs quite accurately even when concentration changes are “read” by individual binding sites. In this paper we study ligand number and site occupancy fluctuations when ligands diffuse and react going beyond the analyses that focus on their asymptotic decay. In this way we show that, for immobile binding sites, fluctuations in the number of bound molecules decay on a relatively fast scale before the asymptotic behavior kicks in. This result can explain the observed co-existence of highly fluctuating instantaneous transcriptional activities with accumulated mRNA concentrations that have relatively small noise levels. We also show that the initial stages of the decay in the bound molecule number fluctuations have one or two characteristic timescales depending on the concentration of free molecules. This transition can explain the changes in enzyme activity observed at the single molecule level."
https://openalex.org/W2295873739,"With the prevalence of Social Networks (SNs) and services, plenty of trust models for Trustworthy Service Recommendation (TSR) in Service-oriented SNs (S-SNs) have been proposed. The reputation-based schemes usually do not contain user preferences and are vulnerable to unfair rating attacks. Meanwhile, the local trust-based schemes generally have low reliability or even fail to work when the trust path is too long or does not exist. Thus it is beneficial to integrate them for TSR in S-SNs. This work improves the state-of-the-art Combining Global and Local Trust (CGLT) scheme and proposes a novel Integrating Reputation and Local Trust (IRLT) model which mainly includes four modules, namely Service Recommendation Interface (SRI) module, Local Trust-based Trust Evaluation (LTTE) module, Reputation-based Trust Evaluation (RTE) module and Aggregation Trust Evaluation (ATE) module. Besides, a synthetic S-SN based on the famous Advogato dataset is deployed and the well-known Discount Cumulative Gain (DCG) metric is employed to measure the service recommendation performance of our IRLT model with comparing to that of the excellent CGLT model. The results illustrate that our IRLT model is slightly superior to the CGLT model in honest environment and significantly outperforms the CGLT model in terms of the robustness against unfair rating attacks."
