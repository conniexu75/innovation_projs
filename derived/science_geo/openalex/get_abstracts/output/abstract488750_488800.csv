https://openalex.org/W2086055453,"An unexpectedly large fraction of genes in metazoans (human, mouse, zebrafish, worm, fruit fly) express high levels of circularized RNAs containing canonical exons. Here we report that circular RNA isoforms are found in diverse species whose most recent common ancestor existed more than one billion years ago: fungi (Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), a plant (Arabidopsis thaliana), and protists (Plasmodium falciparum and Dictyostelium discoideum). For all species studied to date, including those in this report, only a small fraction of the theoretically possible circular RNA isoforms from a given gene are actually observed. Unlike metazoans, Arabidopsis, D. discoideum, P. falciparum, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe have very short introns (∼100 nucleotides or shorter), yet they still produce circular RNAs. A minority of genes in S. pombe and P. falciparum have documented examples of canonical alternative splicing, making it unlikely that all circular RNAs are by-products of alternative splicing or ‘piggyback’ on signals used in alternative RNA processing. In S. pombe, the relative abundance of circular to linear transcript isoforms changed in a gene-specific pattern during nitrogen starvation. Circular RNA may be an ancient, conserved feature of eukaryotic gene expression programs."
https://openalex.org/W1971563489,"Mechanical forces influence many aspects of cell behaviour. Forces are detected and transduced into biochemical signals by force-bearing molecular elements located at the cell surface, in adhesion complexes or in cytoskeletal structures. The nucleus is physically connected to the cell surface through the cytoskeleton and the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, allowing rapid mechanical stress transmission from adhesions to the nucleus. Although it has been demonstrated that nuclei experience force, the direct effect of force on the nucleus is not known. Here we show that isolated nuclei are able to respond to force by adjusting their stiffness to resist the applied tension. Using magnetic tweezers, we found that applying force on nesprin-1 triggers nuclear stiffening that does not involve chromatin or nuclear actin, but requires an intact nuclear lamina and emerin, a protein of the inner nuclear membrane. Emerin becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in response to force and mediates the nuclear mechanical response to tension. Our results demonstrate that mechanotransduction is not restricted to cell surface receptors and adhesions but can occur in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2081513869,"Fuelled by the obesity epidemic, there is considerable interest in the developmental origins of white adipose tissue (WAT) and the stem and progenitor cells from which it arises. Whereas increased visceral fat mass is associated with metabolic dysfunction, increased subcutaneous WAT is protective. There are six visceral fat depots: perirenal, gonadal, epicardial, retroperitoneal, omental and mesenteric, and it is a subject of much debate whether these have a common developmental origin and whether this differs from that for subcutaneous WAT. Here we show that all six visceral WAT depots receive a significant contribution from cells expressing Wt1 late in gestation. Conversely, no subcutaneous WAT or brown adipose tissue arises from Wt1-expressing cells. Postnatally, a subset of visceral WAT continues to arise from Wt1-expressing cells, consistent with the finding that Wt1 marks a proportion of cell populations enriched in WAT progenitors. We show that all visceral fat depots have a mesothelial layer like the visceral organs with which they are associated, and provide several lines of evidence that Wt1-expressing mesothelium can produce adipocytes. These results reveal a major ontogenetic difference between visceral and subcutaneous WAT, and pinpoint the lateral plate mesoderm as a major source of visceral WAT. They also support the notion that visceral WAT progenitors are heterogeneous, and suggest that mesothelium is a source of adipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2026559278,"To expand the capabilities of whole-cell biocatalysis, we have engineered Escherichia coli to produce various esters. The alcohol O-acyltransferase (ATF) class of enzyme uses acyl-CoA units for ester formation. The release of free CoA upon esterification with an alcohol provides the free energy to facilitate ester formation. The diversity of CoA molecules found in nature in combination with various alcohol biosynthetic pathways allows for the biosynthesis of a multitude of esters. Small to medium volatile esters have extensive applications in the flavor, fragrance, cosmetic, solvent, paint and coating industries. The present work enables the production of these compounds by designing several ester pathways in E. coli. The engineered pathways generated acetate esters of ethyl, propyl, isobutyl, 2-methyl-1-butyl, 3-methyl-1-butyl and 2-phenylethyl alcohols. In particular, we achieved high-level production of isobutyl acetate from glucose (17.2 g l(-1)). This strategy was expanded to realize pathways for tetradecyl acetate and several isobutyrate esters."
https://openalex.org/W2086499080,"G4 motifs are greatly enriched near promoters, suggesting that quadruplex structures may be targets of transcriptional regulation. Here we show, by ChIP-Seq analysis of human cells, that 40% of the binding sites of the transcription-associated helicases, XPB and XPD, overlap with G4 motifs. The highly significant overlap of XPB and XPD binding sites with G4 motifs cannot be explained by GC richness or parameters of the genomewide analysis, but instead suggests that these proteins are recruited to quadruplex structures that form in genomic DNA (G4 DNA). Biochemical analysis demonstrates that XPD is a robust G4 DNA helicase and that XPB binds G4 DNA. XPB and XPD are enriched near the transcription start site at 20% of genes, especially highly transcribed genes. XPB and XPD enrichment at G4 motifs characterizes specific signaling pathways and regulatory pathways associated with specific cancers. These results identify new candidate pathways for therapies targeted to quadruplexes."
https://openalex.org/W2062003768,"It is believed that choice behavior reveals the underlying value of goods. The subjective values of stimuli can be changed through reward-based learning mechanisms as well as by modifying the description of the decision problem, but it has yet to be shown that preferences can be manipulated by perturbing intrinsic values of individual items. Here we show that the value of food items can be modulated by the concurrent presentation of an irrelevant auditory cue to which subjects must make a simple motor response (i.e., cue-approach training). Follow-up tests showed that the effects of this pairing on choice lasted at least 2 months after prolonged training. Eye-tracking during choice confirmed that cue-approach training increased attention to the cued items. Neuroimaging revealed the neural signature of a value change in the form of amplified preference-related activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex."

The biological relevance of SEP translation can only be addressed if general strategies for their functional annotation can be developed. Here, we report a functional proteomics strategy to identify the biological functions of SEPs, and use it to identify the SEP MRI-2 as a novel Ku interaction partner. MRI-2, Ku70, and Ku80 coding sequences were obtained from Open Biosystems. The MRI-2 coding sequence was subcloned with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag into pcDNA3, and with a C-terminal His6 tag into pET21a, for mammalian and bacterial expression, respectively. The MRI-1 coding sequence with a C-terminal FLAG tag was synthesized by GenScript and subcloned into pcDNA3. The MRI-3-FLAG coding sequence was subcloned from this construct into pcDNA3. The Ku80 coding sequence was subcloned into pcDNA3 with a C-terminal HA tag. The Ku70 coding sequence was subcloned into pcDNA3 with a C-terminal c-Myc tag. FLAG-tagged MRI-1–3 in pcDNA3 (or empty pcDNA3) was transfected into a 10-cm dish of HEK 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed using Tris-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100 (TBS-T) and Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets. Cells were lysed on ice for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min. Anti-FLAG agarose (clone M2, Sigma) was washed with TBS-T, collected by centrifugation, and then suspended in the cell lysate. Bead suspensions were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h and then washed three times with TBS-T. Bound protein was eluted with 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. For proteomics, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain, and bands elevated in the IP samples were identified and excised. For quantitation via spectral counting, the gel was cut straight across with a clean razor to excise the same molecular weight band in both the sample and the negative control. Protein-containing gel slices were digested with trypsin overnight. The resulting peptide mixtures were extracted from the gel and run on an Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 90-min liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a standard TOP20 method as described previously (7.Slavoff S.A. Mitchell A.J. Schwaid A.G. Cabili M.N. Ma J. Levin J.Z. Karger A.D. Budnik B.A. Rinn J.L. Saghatelian A. et al.Peptidomic discovery of short open reading frame-encoded peptides in human cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were analyzed using our in-house Proteome Browser System against the UniProt_human database. Carbamidomethylated cysteines were set as a fixed modification, and methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. A mass error of 20 ppm was set for precursor ions, and 0.6 Da was set for MS/MS peaks. Two missed cleavages were allowed. Maximum False Discovery Rates were set to 0.01 on both peptide and protein levels. Minimum required peptide length was five amino acids. Interaction candidates were identified by spectral counting as proteins elevated >1.7-fold in the IP relative to the negative control, with an abundance cutoff of 20 spectral counts in the immunoprecipitate. SDS-PAGE gels and transfers were performed as described previously (7.Slavoff S.A. Mitchell A.J. Schwaid A.G. Cabili M.N. Ma J. Levin J.Z. Karger A.D. Budnik B.A. Rinn J.L. Saghatelian A. et al.Peptidomic discovery of short open reading frame-encoded peptides in human cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were blocked with Rockland Immunochemicals fluorescent blocking buffer and then probed with the following primary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution in the same buffer: mouse anti-FLAG (clone M2, Sigma), mouse anti-XRCC6 (Ku70, clone 4C2-1A6, Sigma), mouse anti-XRCC5 (Ku80, clone 3D8, Sigma). Secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse IR dye 800 and goat anti-rabbit IR dye 680 (LI-COR), were applied at a dilution of 1:4000 in Rockland Immunochemicals fluorescent blocking buffer. Infrared imaging was performed on a LI-COR Odyssey. Cells were grown, transfected, fixed, and permeabilized as described previously (7.Slavoff S.A. Mitchell A.J. Schwaid A.G. Cabili M.N. Ma J. Levin J.Z. Karger A.D. Budnik B.A. Rinn J.L. Saghatelian A. et al.Peptidomic discovery of short open reading frame-encoded peptides in human cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Etoposide (Sigma) was applied to cells at 50 μm for 4 h. Cells were stained with primary antibodies: mouse anti-FLAG (clone M2, Sigma); rabbit anti-HA (Rockland Immunochemicals); and/or chicken anti-c-Myc (Aves Labs). Secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568, goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, and goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 647. All antibodies were applied at a 1:1000 dilution in fluorescence blocking buffer (Rockland Immunochemicals) for at least 1 h at 4 °C followed by three phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) washes after fixation with formalin and nuclear counterstain with Hoechst 33342. Coverslips were inverted and imaged in PBS in MatTek imaging dishes. Confocal imaging was performed on a Zeiss AxioObserver inverted confocal microscope with 40× oil immersion objective, Yokogawa spinning disk confocal head, quad-band notch dichroic mirror (405/488/568/647), and 405 (diode), 491 (diode pumped solid-state laser), 561 (diode pumped solid-state laser), and 640 nm (diode) lasers (all 50 milliwatt). Hoechst 33342 was imaged with 405 nm laser excitation, 445/40 nm emission; Alexa Fluor 488 with 491 nm laser excitation, 528/38 nm emission; Alexa Fluor 568 with 561 nm laser excitation, 617/73 nm emission; and Alexa Fluor 647 with 640 nm laser excitation, 700/75 nm emission. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were collected. All image collection and analysis was performed with SlideBook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Fluorophore channels in each experiment were normalized to the same intensity ranges for presentation. To determine the nuclear fraction of MRI-2, regions of interest were manually drawn on whole cells, as defined by MRI-2 staining and the DIC image, and on the nucleus, as defined by Hoechst 33342 staining. Background was defined for whole cell and nucleus using an untransfected cell. For each cell, the ratio of the background-corrected nuclear sum intensity to the background-corrected whole cell sum intensity was used to calculate the nuclear fraction. Single cell data were plotted as histograms, and population averages were calculated. Statistical analysis of significance was by two-tailed Student's t test, and error bars represent S.E. His6-tagged MRI-2 in pET21a was transformed into BL21 Star DE3 cells. A saturated 10-ml overnight culture in Luria Bertani broth (LB) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was diluted into a 2-liter LB-ampicillin culture and grown at 37 °C with shaking to optical density 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were grown at 30 °C with shaking for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein was purified using a protocol previously reported for Ku (18.Hanakahi L.A. et al.2-Step purification of the Ku DNA repair protein expressed in Escherichia coli.Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 52: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Pure MRI-2 (assayed by SDS-PAGE) was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, aliquoted, and flash-frozen. Protein concentration was determined with Bradford assay (Pierce) with reference to BSA. Ramos whole cell extract was prepared as described previously (19.Baumann P.

Briefly, reactions (10 μl) were carried out in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm KOAc, 0.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and HindIII-linearized 5′-32P-labeled pBluescript DNA (10 ng) with 20 μg of whole cell extract. Wortmannin (Sigma) was added at 3 μm, and anti-XRCC4 antibody (Abcam) was used at 1:50 final dilution. Four replicate experiments were performed; statistical analysis of significance was by two-tailed Student's t test, and error bars represent S.E. We focused our study on a 69-amino acid SEP from the C7orf49 gene identified in our previous peptidomics profiling of K562 cells (Fig. 1A) (6.Ma J. Ward C.C. Jungreis I. Slavoff S.A. Schwaid A.G.

Saghatelian A. et al.Peptidomic discovery of short open reading frame-encoded peptides in human cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Because this SEP was annotated as a predicted protein in the NCBI nonredundant protein database, we did not include it in the list of reported SEPs (7.Slavoff S.A. Mitchell A.J. Schwaid A.G. Cabili M.N. Ma J. Levin J.Z. Karger A.D. Budnik B.A. Rinn J.L. Saghatelian A. et al.Peptidomic discovery of short open reading frame-encoded peptides in human cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar); however, our evidence is the first experimental detection of this polypeptide in cells. Identifying a protein or polypeptide from a single MS/MS spectrum requires the highest spectral quality, and this spectrum passes our criteria (7.Slavoff S.A. Mitchell A.J. Schwaid A.G. Cabili M.N. Ma J. Levin J.Z. Karger A.D. Budnik B.A. Rinn J.L. Saghatelian A. et al.Peptidomic discovery of short open reading frame-encoded peptides in human cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), with a continuous y ion series of 11 fragments and an Sf score (23.Christofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Wu N. Asara J.M. Cantley L.C. et al.Pyruvate kinase M2 is a phosphotyrosine-binding protein.Nature. 2008; 452: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) of 0.88 (Fig. 1B). This provides the first evidence for endogenous expression of this SEP in a human cell line. This SEP represented a good candidate for functional characterization for two reasons. First, C7orf49 is conserved in mammals (24.Agarwal S. Harada J. Schreifels J. Lech P. Nikolai B. Yamaguchi T. Chanda S.K. Somia N.V. et al.Isolation, characterization, and genetic complementation of a cellular mutant resistant to retroviral infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15933-15938Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting that this gene has undergone functional selection. Second, the alternatively spliced C7orf49 gene is predicted to produce three polypeptide isoforms with distinct sequences, one of which has a known function (Fig. 1C). Isoform 1, a 157-amino acid polypeptide, was identified as a modulator of retrovirus infection in a phenotypic screen (24.Agarwal S. Harada J. Schreifels J. Lech P. Nikolai B. Yamaguchi T. Chanda S.K. Somia N.V. et al.Isolation, characterization, and genetic complementation of a cellular mutant resistant to retroviral infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15933-15938Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although its molecular mechanism remains unclear. C7orf49 isoform 1 was therefore named modulator of retrovirus infection homolog 1 (MRI-1). The SEP we detect corresponds to MRI isoform 2 (MRI-2), and the third isoform is referred to as MRI-3, neither of which has been previously characterized. Taken together, we characterized the MRI-2 SEP because of the conservation and known cellular function of the MRI/C7orf49 gene. SEPs are small and, therefore, most likely to function via interactions with other biomolecules than to have catalytic activity. Identifying SEP-protein interactions using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) proteomics represents a general strategy for SEP functional characterization. Co-IP of MRI-2 from HEK293T cells enriched two bands at 70 and 80 kDa (Fig. 2A). Semiquantitative proteomics via spectral counting revealed these proteins to be Ku70 and Ku80, the two subunits of the heterodimeric DNA end-binding protein Ku (Fig. 2B). We validated these interactions by Western blotting using antibodies against Ku70 and Ku80 (Fig. 2C). We note that enrichment of heat shock protein 70 family members (e.g. HSPA8, HSPA1A, HSPA9), which function as chaperones, is not likely to be functionally relevant as these proteins are the most commonly detected nonspecific interaction partners detected in co-IP experiments (25.Mellacheruvu D. Wright Z. Couzens A.L. Lambert J.P. St-Denis N.A. Li T. Miteva Y.V. Hauri S. Sardiu M.E. Low T.Y. Halim V.A. Bagshaw R.D. Hubner N.C. Al-Hakim A. Bouchard A. Faubert D. Fermin D. Dunham W.H.

Methods. 2013; 10: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). MRI-1 and -3 may serve related functions, so we repeated the co-IP for the additional isoforms. Co-IP of MRI-1 and -3, followed by quantitative proteomics and Western blotting, revealed that MRI-1 also binds to Ku, as well as DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), whereas MRI-3 does not enrich any proteins (Fig. 2, D–H). MRI-1 and -2 likely interact with Ku through their shared N-terminal 46 amino acids, which are missing in MRI-3 (Fig. 1C). Ku and DNA-PKcs are key participants in the NHEJ pathway of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. DSBs, caused by ionizing radiation, DNA-damaging drugs, and free radicals (26.Lieber M.R. et al.The mechanism of double-strand DNA break repair by the nonhomologous DNA end-joining pathway.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 181-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar), are so toxic that a single unrepaired lesion can lead to cell death (27.Jackson S.P. et al.Sensing and repairing DNA double-strand breaks.Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar); alternatively, unrepaired DSBs can lead to chromosomal instability and/or translocations (27.Jackson S.P. et al.Sensing and repairing DNA double-strand breaks.Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). NHEJ is the predominant DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells (28.Chapman J.R. Taylor M.R. Boulton S.J. et al.Playing the end game: DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice.Mol. Cell. 2012; 47: 497-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 29.Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. et al.Mechanism and regulation of human non-homologous DNA end-joining.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The first protein to bind the DSB is the Ku heterodimer, a ring-shaped DNA end-binding protein (30.Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. et al.Structure of the Ku heterodimer bound to DNA and its implications for double-strand break repair.Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) that acts as the DNA-binding subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (31.Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. et al.The DNA-dependent protein kinase.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Binding of Ku and subsequent assembly of DNA-PK are followed by recruitment of additional repair factors that resect and ligate the DSB. The interaction of MRI-2 with Ku suggests that MRI-2 may participate in NHEJ. MRI-2 expressed in HeLa and HEK293T cells was observed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 3, A and C, top). The nuclear fraction of MRI-2 in HeLa ranged from 19 to 45% of the total protein, with a population average of 29 ± 7% (S.E.) (Fig. 3A, top, and 3C). Similarly, in HEK293T cells, nuclear MRI-2 ranged from 14 to 80%, with a population average of 33 ± 3% (Fig. 3B, top, and 3D). Although a significant fraction of MRI-2 is nuclear, MRI-2 does not contain an obvious nuclear localization sequence. This SEP is small enough to passively diffuse through the nuclear pore, which is permeable to proteins <20–40 kDa (32.Fried H. Kutay U. et al.Nucleocytoplasmic transport: taking an inventory.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the mechanism of MRI-2 nuclear localization depends upon its passive diffusion into nuclei followed by association with Ku, which is almost exclusively nuclear (33.Bertinato J. Schild-Poulter C. Haché R.J. et al.Nuclear localization of Ku antigen is promoted independently by basic motifs in the Ku70 and Ku80 subunits.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 89-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For factors that depend upon protein-protein interactions for localization, overexpression can saturate interaction partners, leading to aberrant cellular distribution (34.Gross G.G. Junge J.A. Mora R.J. Kwon H.B. Olson C.A. Takahashi T.T. Liman E.R. Ellis-Davies G.C. McGee A.W. Sabatini B.L. Roberts R.W.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). This suggests that the cell-to-cell variation in MRI-2 nuclear localization might be caused by different levels of MRI-2 expression. We therefore examined whether increased Ku expression, through co-expression of Ku70 and Ku80, increased nuclear localization of MRI-2. Co-expression of Ku resulted in enhanced nuclear localization of MRI-2, which ranged from 23 to 85% (average 38 ± 2%) in HeLa and from 27 to 85% (average 60 ± 3%) in HEK293T (Fig. 3, A and B, bottom, and C and D). This represents a Ku-mediated increase in MRI-2 nuclear localization of 33% in HeLa (p = 0.005) and 82% in HEK23T (p = 8 × 10−8). Inspection of nuclei of co-transfected cells revealed co-localization of MRI-2 and Ku80 (Fig. 3E). We then tested the effect of Ku co-expression on the subcellular distribution of MRI-1 and -3. Nuclear localization of MRI-1 was enriched by Ku co-expression, whereas MRI-3 was unaffected (Fig. 3F). These data are consistent with our hypothesis that nuclear enrichment of MRI-1 and -2 is dependent upon direct interaction with Ku. We then examined the nuclear localization of MRI-2 after induction of DSBs using the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, which creates DSBs and induces NHEJ. Etoposide treatment increased the nuclear localization of MRI-2 relative to vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 4A), evident in both single cell histograms of the percentage of MRI-2 in the nucleus (Fig. 4B) and the population average of MRI-2 nuclear localization, which increases by ∼31% (p = 0.007, Fig. 4C). Although the magnitude of this effect is small, nuclear recruitment of MRI-2 by etoposide treatment is consistent with a role for this protein in NHEJ in cells. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we confirmed that MRI-2 interacts with Ku bound to DNA in vitro. Radiolabeled double-stranded DNA is incubated with purified Ku70 and Ku80, which results in formation of Ku-DNA or Ku2-DNA complexes that can be resolved by gel electrophoresis. The addition of purified MRI-2 results in the decreased mobility of the complex, confirming tripartite complex formation (Fig. 4D). Although we do not have independent confirmation that the lower mobility species contain MRI-2, this conclusion is consistent with the co-IP data. Furthermore, the progressive mobility shift suggests that multiple molecules of MRI-2 bind to each Ku-DNA complex. Finally, we measured the effect of purified MRI-2 on NHEJ efficiency in vitro using a double-stranded DNA ligation assay in cell extracts (18.Hanakahi L.A. et al.2-Step purification of the Ku DNA repair protein expressed in Escherichia coli.Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 52: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22.Smeaton M.B. Miller P.S. Ketner G.

Cancer Res. 2011; 9: 1366-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant MRI-2 was added to NHEJ-competent cell extracts, and the conversion of a radiolabeled DNA duplex to higher molecular weight oligomeric ligation products was monitored. Comparison of the basal NHEJ reaction to a reaction containing added MRI-2 (5 μm) demonstrated an increase in product formation of 68% (p = 0.02) (Fig. 4E). Controls employing a DNA-PK inhibitor, wortmannin, as well as an antibody against the required NHEJ protein, XRCC4, eliminate end joining in these extracts, confirming that the ligation activity observed is due to bona fide NHEJ. This demonstrates that MRI-2 stimulates DSB ligation via NHEJ. In this study, we have identified MRI-2 as an interaction partner of Ku. MRI-2 is recruited to the nucleus by Ku overexpression and by induction of DSBs, and enhances the rate of NHEJ in vitro. MRI-2 is therefore a novel NHEJ factor (Fig. 4F), which may stimulate NHEJ in a number of ways, such as enhancing DSB binding by Ku, promoting assembly of the repair complex, and/or releasing Ku from DNA to promote multiple turnovers. Future mechanistic studies will reveal the molecular role of this SEP in DSB repair. The MRI gene produces three polypeptides, MRI-1–3, and although we focused on characterization of the interaction partners and functions of MRI-2, we also investigated the interactions of MRI-1 and -3. MRI-1 interacts with Ku as well as DNA-PK, suggesting that MRI-1 and -2 may both function in NHEJ. MRI-3 does not bind to Ku, suggesting that this isoform may be inactive. These varying interaction specificities identify a Ku binding sequence in MRI-1 and -2, and also suggest that alternative splicing of MRI transcripts could differentially affect NHEJ efficiency inside cells. MRI-1 was originally identified as a factor that enabled retroviral infection of mammalian cells (24.Agarwal S. Harada J. Schreifels J. Lech P. Nikolai B. Yamaguchi T. Chanda S.K. Somia N.V. et al.Isolation, characterization, and genetic complementation of a cellular mutant resistant to retroviral infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15933-15938Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), based on genetic complementation of retroviral infection-resistant cells by overexpression of an MRI-1 cDNA clone. This study also reported that RNAi-mediated silencing of MRI decreases retroviral infection sensitivity. Because treatment of the cells with a proteasome inhibitor phenocopied MRI-1 overexpression, the authors concluded that MRI-1 acts on the proteasome. Our work, however, suggests a different mechanism for the involvement of the MRI gene in retroviral infection. It is well established that NHEJ in the host cell is utilized during retroviral infection, promoting stable viral genome integration by resolving linear DNA fragments of this process (38.Daniel R. Greger J.G. Katz R.A. Taganov K.D. Wu X. Kappes J.C.

Therefore, MRI-1 may enhance retroviral infection via its interaction with Ku, and MRI-2 may also be involved in this process. Future work to determine the role of NHEJ during the rescue of retroviral expression by MRI-1 and -2 will test this hypothesis. In conclusion, hundreds of newly discovered SEPs have now been reported in human cells (1.Andrews S.J.

The identification of the MRI-2-Ku interaction suggests that functional proteomics is a general method to identify the cellular and biochemical roles of newly discovered SEPs. The involvement of MRI-2 in NHEJ, a central process required for cell survival, suggests that many more SEPs may have important cellular functions and demonstrates the continued need to discover and functionally characterize all SEPs produced from the human genome.

https://openalex.org/W1992659047,"Much of what we know about the signal transduction machinery of the canonical Wnt pathway comes from studying the colon, where low- versus high-activity Wnt signaling states are known to distinguish normal colon epithelium turnover from colorectal cancer. Here, Fancy et al. demonstrate that a pathological Wnt activity state akin to that in colon cancer exists in oligodendrocyte precursor cells in human neonatal white matter injury, which leads to detrimental maturation arrest of these cells. These oligodendrocyte precursors in human newborn brain injury express multiple genes in common with colon cancer, demonstrating a pathological Wnt tone in non-genetic human disease. In colon cancer, mutation of the Wnt repressor APC (encoding adenomatous polyposis coli) leads to a state of aberrant and unrestricted high-activity signaling. However, the relevance of high Wnt tone in non-genetic human disease is unknown. Here we demonstrate that distinct functional states of Wnt activity determine oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and myelination. Mouse OPCs with genetic Wnt dysregulation (high tone) express multiple genes in common with colon cancer, including Lef1, Sp5, Ets2, Rnf43 and Dusp4. Surprisingly, we found that OPCs in lesions of hypoxic human neonatal white matter injury upregulated markers of high Wnt activity and lacked expression of APC. We also found that lack of Wnt repressor tone promoted permanent white matter injury after mild hypoxic insult. These findings suggest a state of pathological high-activity Wnt signaling in human disease tissues that lack predisposing genetic mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2021183672,"Background Default mode network (DMN) is one of the most commonly recognized resting-state networks in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the homogeneity of this network in MDD is poorly understood. As such, this study was conducted to determine whether or not an abnormal network homogeneity (NH) of DMN is observed in patients with first-episode and drug-naive MDD. Methods Twenty-four first-episode drug-naive patients with MDD and twenty-four healthy control subjects participated in the study. NH and independent component analysis (ICA) methods were used to analyze data. Results Depressed patients exhibited a significantly increased NH in the left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and decreased NH in the right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) compared with the healthy control subjects. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were analyzed and results revealed that the NH values of MPFC and ITG could be applied as candidate markers with relatively high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish patients from healthy control subjects. No correlation was observed between the NH values of the two regions and clinical variables. Conclusions Our findings suggested that an abnormal DMN homogeneity could be observed in MDD, which highlight the importance of the DMN in the pathophysiology of MDD."

Evening chronotype is associated with poor sleep quality, more mind wandering and more daydreaming; negative affect is also a mutual correlate. This exploratory study investigated how mind wandering and daydreaming are related to different aspects of sleep quality, and whether sleep quality influences the relationships between mind wandering/daydreaming and negative affect, and mind wandering/daydreaming and chronotype. Three surveys (Ns = 213; 190; 270) were completed with Chinese adults aged 18-50, including measures of sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, mind wandering, daydreaming, chronotype and affect (positive and negative). Higher frequencies of mind wandering and daydreaming were associated with poorer sleep quality, in particular with poor subjective sleep quality and increased sleep latency, night-time disturbance, daytime dysfunction and daytime sleepiness. Poor sleep quality was found to partially mediate the relationships between daydreaming and negative affect, and mind wandering and negative affect. Additionally, low positive affect and poor sleep quality, in conjunction, fully mediated the relationships between chronotype and mind wandering, and chronotype and daydreaming. The relationships between mind wandering/daydreaming and positive affect were also moderated by chronotype, being weaker in those with a morning preference. Finally, while daytime sleepiness was positively correlated with daydream frequency, it was negatively correlated with a measure of problem-solving daydreams, indicating that more refined distinctions between different forms of daydreaming or mind wandering are warranted. Overall, the evidence is suggestive of a bi-directional relationship between poor sleep quality and mind wandering/daydreaming, which may be important in attempts to deal with sleep problems and improve sleep quality. These findings and further research on this topic may also have implications for definitions and theories of mind wandering and daydreaming."

The exact function of NblA has been the subject of numerous studies. Binding experiments have shown that NblA interacts with the α-subunits of phycobiliproteins (18.Luque I. Ochoa De Alda J.A.

In pull-down experiments, NblA was found to bind to ClpC, an HSP100 chaperone partner of a Clp protease, in an ATP-dependent manner (20.Karradt A. Sobanski J. Mattow J. Lockau W. Baier K. NblA, a key protein of phycobilisome degradation, interacts with ClpC, a HSP100 chaperone partner of a cyanobacterial Clp protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32394-32403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This result led to a proposed model of PBS degradation in which NblA acts as a so-called adaptor protein of a Clp protease (20.Karradt A. Sobanski J. Mattow J. Lockau W. Baier K.

Clp degradation complexes consist of two functional elements: a cylinder-like proteolytic core of two heptameric rings and an AAA+ chaperone (21.Grimaud R. Kessel M. Beuron F. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. Enzymatic and structural similarities between the Escherichia coli ATP-dependent proteases, ClpXP and ClpAP.J. Biol.

The structure of ClpP at 2.3 Å resolution suggests a model for ATP-dependent proteolysis.Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The hexameric chaperone ring is responsible for substrate recognition, unfolding, and threading of the extended polypeptide chain through a narrow pore into the protease compartment, where the proteolytically active sites are sequestered from the cytoplasm (23.Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Molecular determinants of complex formation between Clp/Hsp100 ATPases and the ClpP peptidase.Nat. Struct.

Alternating translocation of protein substrates from both ends of ClpXP protease.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4938-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of a Clp protease is determined by its chaperone partner. Substrate recognition occurs by binding to the chaperone partner of the Clp protease or is mediated by adaptor proteins (25.Dougan D.A. Mogk A. Zeth K. Turgay K. Bukau B. AAA+ proteins and substrate recognition, it all depends on their partner in crime.FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26.Levchenko I. Seidel M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. A specificity-enhancing factor for the ClpXP degradation machine.Science. 2000; 289: 2354-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Adaptor proteins simultaneously bind the substrate and the chaperone, thereby forming a ternary complex that causes degradation of the substrate. In other words, adaptor proteins modulate the substrate specificity of a protease, enabling the degradation of particular proteins at the proper time. This means that substrate degradation is solely regulated by the expression of the adaptor protein. This is precisely what is observed in PBS degradation, which is induced by the expression of the small protein NblA (14.Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. A small polypeptide triggers complete degradation of light-harvesting phycobiliproteins in nutrient-deprived cyanobacteria.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because the Clp proteases require NblA to recognize phycobiliproteins as substrates, strains lacking NblA degrade the PBS at a low rate, even under conditions of nitrogen starvation (14.Collier J.L.

Most phycobiliprotein-containing cyanobacteria and red algae possess nblA genes. The NblA proteins are rather small, consisting of ∼60 amino acids. Sequence alignment of NblA proteins reveals a low homology (about 30% sequence identity on average) (27.Dines M. Sendersky E. David L. Schwarz R. Adir N.

Short stretches of highly conserved amino acid residues located near the N and C termini of the proteins are involved in phycobiliprotein and ClpC binding (19.Bienert R. Baier K. Volkmer R. Lockau W.

They are homodimers that consist of two α-helices: one shorter N-terminal helix and a longer C-terminal helix. The biologically active form of NblA is thus a four-helix bundle. Cyanobacteria and red algae usually possess one nblA gene. However, two genes have been found in Nostoc 7120 and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Synechocystis 6803). Whereas only one of the two nblA genes is expressed upon nitrogen deprivation in Nostoc 7120 and is sufficient for PBS degradation (17.Baier K. Lehmann H. Stephan D.P. Lockau W. NblA is essential for phycobilisome degradation in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 but not for development of functional heterocysts.Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2739-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), both genes are expressed in Synechocystis 6803, and both are necessary for induction of the degradation process (15.Baier K. Nicklisch S. Grundner C. Reinecke J. Lockau W. Expression of two nblA-homologous genes is required for phycobilisome degradation in nitrogen-starved Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.FEMS Microbiol.

In this study, we investigated why the two NblA proteins, NblA16803 and NblA26803, are necessary for PBS degradation in Synechocystis 6803. We present evidence that NblA16803 and NblA26803 act as a heterodimer in which NblA16803 mediates the binding to ClpC6803 and phycobiliproteins. Both NblA proteins are degraded by a Clp protease in vitro, a finding that strongly supports the proposed model of the role of NblA in PBS degradation. We further show that expression of the single nblA gene from Nostoc 7120 complements the non-bleaching phenotype of the nblA1/nblA2 double mutant of Synechocystis 6803. Strains are listed in supplemental Table S1. Unless stated otherwise, sources of plasmids, antibiotics, medium, restriction enzymes, and chemicals were as described previously (20.Karradt A. Sobanski J. Mattow J. Lockau W. Baier K. NblA, a key protein of phycobilisome degradation, interacts with ClpC, a HSP100 chaperone partner of a cyanobacterial Clp protease.J. Biol.

Synechocystis 6803 and its mutants were grown photoautotrophically under constant illumination essentially as described before (17.Baier K. Lehmann H. Stephan D.P. Lockau W. NblA is essential for phycobilisome degradation in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 but not for development of functional heterocysts.Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2739-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) except that the growth temperature was 28 °C, and the internal diameter of the culture vessels was 3.5 cm. Whole-cell absorbance spectra were recorded from 550 to 750 nm on a Specord® 200 PLUS spectrophotometer (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany) and were corrected for cell scattering at 750 nm. Strains of Escherichia coli were grown under standard conditions (28.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). When appropriate, antibiotics were added to the medium to final concentrations of 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin, 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin, or 25 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol, respectively. Plasmids and oligonucleotides are listed in supplemental Table S1 and Fig. S1. Vectors for expression of GST-tagged NblA16803 and NblA26803 in E. coli were constructed as follows. The plasmid pGEX-2TK/NdeI (20.Karradt A. Sobanski J. Mattow J. Lockau W. Baier K. NblA, a key protein of phycobilisome degradation, interacts with ClpC, a HSP100 chaperone partner of a cyanobacterial Clp protease.J. Biol.

The resultant plasmid pACYC/GST was digested with NdeI and, after dephosphorylation, was ligated to a fragment harboring nblA16803 (ssl0452) or nblA26803 (ssl0453), respectively, yielding plasmids pACYC/A1_GST and pACYC/A2_GST. Fragments encoding nblA16803 and nblA26803 were generated by PCR from genomic Synechocystis 6803 DNA using primers nbl7 and nbl28 (amplification of nblA16803) or nbl24 and nbl31 (amplification of nblA26803). Each primer sequence contained an NdeI restriction site for cloning. The primers nbl28 and nbl31 additionally contained a sequence encoding the PreScissionTM protease recognition sequence, enabling cleavage of the NblA16803/NblA26803-GST fusion protein. For coexpression of His-tagged NblA16803 and GST-tagged NblA26803, the nblA16803 gene was amplified by PCR using primers nbl32 (EcoRI site incorporated) and nblA-4 (HindIII site incorporated) and was ligated into plasmid pACYC/A2_GST to yield plasmid pACYC/His_A1 and A2_GST. For simultaneous expression of His-tagged NblA26803 and GST-tagged NblA16803, nblA26803 was amplified by PCR using primers nbl33 (HindIII site inserted) and nbl34 (EcoRI site inserted). The PCR fragment was cloned into the plasmid pACYC/A1_GST, generating plasmid pACYC/His_A2 and A1_GST. For coexpression of NblA26803 and GST-tagged NblA16803, the nblA26803 gene was amplified by PCR using the primer nbl14 (NcoI site incorporated) and nbl21 (EcoRI site incorporated). The resulting PCR fragment was ligated into plasmid pACYC/A1_GST, generating plasmid pACYC/A2 and A1_GST. For binding experiments, the ClpC6803 protein was expressed without any affinity tag. For construction of the expression plasmid, clpC6803 (sll0020) was amplified by PCR from total Synechocystis 6803 DNA using primers clpC_3 (NdeI site inserted) and clpC_5 (BamHI site inserted). The PCR fragment was digested with NdeI (partial digestion) and BamHI and cloned into plasmid pET11a, yielding plasmid pET11/ClpC. For degradation experiments, the ClpC6803 protein was expressed with an N-terminal His tag. ClpC6803 was amplified by PCR with clpC_3 (NdeI site inserted) and clpC_5 (BamHI site inserted) and ligated into plasmid pET22b, resulting in plasmid pET22b/HisClpC6803. For expression of the phycocyanin α-subunit N-terminally fused to GST, the chromosomal gene cpcA (sll1578) from Synechocystis 6803 was amplified by PCR using primers cpcA_1 (BamHI site inserted) and cpcA_2 (EcoRI site inserted) and cloned into plasmid pGEX-2TK via BamHI and EcoRI to yield plasmid pGEX/cpcA. For expression of HisClpP1 and ClpR, the clpP1 (slr0542) gene was first amplified with primers clpP1_1 (NcoI site incorporated) and clpP1_2 (NcoI site incorporated) from total Synechocystis 6803 DNA. The PCR product was digested with NcoI cloned into plasmid pACYCDuet-1, yielding the plasmid pACYC/HisClpP1. The clpR (slr0164) gene was then PCR-amplified with primers clpR_1 (NdeI site inserted) and clpR_2 (XhoI site inserted). The PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into the plasmid pACYC/HisClpP1, resulting in the plasmid pACYC/HisClpP1, ClpR. All DNA constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. All plasmids and oligonucleotides are listed in supplemental Table S1. The PBS preparation was performed as described before (29.Ducret A. Sidler W. Wehrli E. Frank G. Zuber H.

After induction with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h at 30 °C, cells were pelleted and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT). Cells were disrupted by sonication with a homogenizer (Sonopuls) for 2 × 2 min (settings: KS76, pulsation 2, 55% power), and the extract was clarified by centrifugation and incubated with Protino® Ni-IDA resins (Macherey-Nagel). Bound proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol and eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole, followed by buffer change and concentration with a centrifugal concentrator (Vivaspin® 500, molecular weight cut-off 10,000) in buffer A. After induction with IPTG overnight at 18 °C, cells were pelleted, resuspended in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7,5), 200 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol), cell-free extracts were prepared as described above. The soluble crude extract was incubated with glutathione-agarose (Macherey-Nagel). After washing with buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted using Pre-ScissionTM protease according to the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare). The NblA16803 and NblA26803 proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75TM column (GE Healthcare). GST-NblA16803 and His-NblA26803 or His-NblA16803 and GST-NblA26803 were coexpressed after induction with IPTG (overnight, 18 °C). Crude extracts were divided; one half was incubated with glutathione-agarose (Macherey-Nagel) for binding of GST-tagged NblA, and the other half was incubated with Protino® Ni-IDA resins (Macherey-Nagel) for binding of His-tagged NblA. Purification was performed as described above. Eluted proteins were immediately analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE with 6 m urea (30.Schägger H. von Jagow G.

The N-terminally GST-tagged α-subunit of PC (GST-PC) was expressed after induction with IPTG for 3 h at 30 °C and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare). Expression of the C-terminally GST-tagged NblA16803 (NblA16803-GST) was induced with IPTG for 80 h at 18 °C. NblA26803-GST was expressed with IPTG overnight at 18 °C. GST fusion proteins were purified as described above. GST-free NblA16803 and NblA26803 were obtained by on-column cleavage with PreScissionTM protease (GE Healthcare). The NblA16803-GST and His-tagged NblA26803 were purified as described above. The expression of ClpC6803 was induced by IPTG for 3 h at 30 °C. The soluble fraction of the crude extract containing overexpressed ClpC6803 without affinity tag was used for the in vitro binding assays. In vitro binding assays were started by adding glutathione-agarose to the soluble cell extract containing the overexpressed GST-PC fusion protein. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation, unbound proteins were removed by three washes with five column volumes of buffer B. The PC-loaded agarose was divided into four equal aliquots and incubated with crude extract containing overexpressed ClpC6803. Additionally ATP, NblA16803, NblA26803, or NblA16803 and His-NblA26803 were added in surplus. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation, unbound proteins were removed by washing with buffer B containing 1 mm ATP as described above. Bound proteins were eluted by the addition of 40 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Eluted proteins were directly analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE with 6 m urea. Each purified protein was used in a final concentration of 2 μm in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2).

https://openalex.org/W2057385289,"It has been well established that blood pressure and renal function undergo circadian fluctuations. We have demonstrated that the circadian protein Per1 regulates multiple genes involved in sodium transport in the collecting duct of the kidney. However, the role of Per1 in other parts of the nephron has not been investigated. The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) plays a critical role in renal sodium reabsorption. Sodium is reabsorbed in this segment through the actions of the NaCl co-transporter (NCC), which is regulated by the with-no-lysine kinases (WNKs). The goal of this study was to test if Per1 regulates sodium transport in the DCT through modulation of NCC and the WNK kinases, WNK1 and WNK4. Pharmacological blockade of nuclear Per1 entry resulted in decreased mRNA expression of NCC and WNK1 but increased expression of WNK4 in the renal cortex of mice. These findings were confirmed by using Per1 siRNA and pharmacological blockade of Per1 nuclear entry in mDCT15 cells, a model of the mouse distal convoluted tubule. Transcriptional regulation was demonstrated by changes in short lived heterogeneous nuclear RNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated interaction of Per1 and CLOCK with the promoters of NCC, WNK1, and WNK4. This interaction was modulated by blockade of Per1 nuclear entry. Importantly, NCC protein expression and NCC activity, as measured by thiazide-sensitive, chloride-dependent (22)Na uptake, were decreased upon pharmacological inhibition of Per1 nuclear entry. Taken together, these data demonstrate a role for Per1 in the transcriptional regulation of NCC, WNK1, and WNK4."
https://openalex.org/W2058839725,"The liver plays a major role in the formation of H2S, a novel signaling molecule. Diabetes is associated with lower blood levels of H2S. This study investigated the activities of cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE, the enzyme that catalyzes H2S formation) in livers of type 1 diabetic (T1D) animals and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from T1D patients. T1D is associated with both hyperketonemia (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate) and hyperglycemia. This study also examined the role of hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia per se in decreased CSE activity using U937 monocytes and PBMC isolated from healthy subjects. Livers from streptozotocin-treated T1D rats demonstrated a significantly higher reactive oxygen species production, lower CSE protein expression and activity, and lower H2S formation compared with those of controls. Studies with T1D patients showed a decrease in CSE protein expression and activity in PBMC compared with those of age-matched normal subjects. Cell culture studies demonstrated that high glucose (25 mm) and/or acetoacetate (4 mm) increased reactive oxygen species, decreased CSE mRNA expression, protein expression, and enzymatic activity, and reduced H2S levels; however, β-hydroxybutyrate treatment had no effect. A similar effect, which was also observed in PBMC treated with high glucose alone or along with acetoacetate, was prevented by vitamin D supplementation. Studies with CSE siRNA provide evidence for a relationship between impaired CSE expression and reduced H2S levels. This study demonstrates for the first time that both hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia mediate a reduction in CSE expression and activity, which can contribute to the impaired H2S signaling associated with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2020940584,"The trace element zinc is often used in the diet of weaned piglets, as high doses have resulted in positive effects on intestinal health. However, the majority of previous studies evaluated zinc supplementations for a short period only and focused on the small intestine. The hypothesis of the present study was that low, medium and high levels of dietary zinc (57, 164 and 2,425 mg Zn/kg from zinc oxide) would affect colonic morphology and innate host defense mechanisms across 4 weeks post-weaning. Histological examinations were conducted regarding the colonic morphology and neutral, acidic, sialylated and sulphated mucins. The mRNA expression levels of mucin (MUC) 1, 2, 13, 20, toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, 4, interleukin (IL)-1β, 8, 10, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were also measured. The colonic crypt area increased in an age-depending manner, and the greatest area was found with medium concentration of dietary zinc. With the high concentration of dietary zinc, the number of goblet cells containing mixed neutral-acidic mucins and total mucins increased. Sialomucin containing goblet cells increased age-dependently. The expression of MUC2 increased with age and reached the highest level at 47 days of age. The expression levels of TLR2 and 4 decreased with age. The mRNA expression of TLR4 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 were down-regulated with high dietary zinc treatment, while piglets fed with medium dietary zinc had the highest expression. It is concluded that dietary zinc level had a clear impact on colonic morphology, mucin profiles and immunological traits in piglets after weaning. Those changes might support local defense mechanisms and affect colonic physiology and contribute to the reported reduction of post-weaning diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W2043579129,"Introduction Adaptation to living with a stoma is complex, and studies have shown that stoma creation has a great impact on patients' health related quality of life. The objective was to explore the effect of a structured patient education program on health related quality of life. Therefore, we implemented interventions aimed at increasing health related quality of life during and after hospital admission. Materials and Methods We designed a case/control study aimed at adult patients admitted to the surgical ward for stoma creation, irrespective of type of stoma or reason for creation of stoma. We included 50 patients in the study. Health related quality of life was measured before hospital discharge, three months and six months after stoma creation. The program included educational interventions involving lay-teachers, alongside health professional teachers. Results We found a significant rise in health related quality of life in the intervention group (P<0.001) and no significant change in the control group (P = 0.144). However, we found no significant differences when comparing between groups at 3 and 6 months (p = 0.12 and p = 0.63, respective). Additionally, there were differences in scores in health related quality of life baseline (p = 0.045) with lower scores in the intervention group compared with the intervention group. However, there were no significant differences in the demographic variables at baseline Conclusions Educational activities aimed at increase in knowledge and focusing on patients' psychosocial needs may lead to a rise in patients' health related quality of life. When patients with a stoma attend a structured patient education program it is possible to improve their health related quality of life compared with patients with a stoma, who do not attend the program.

https://openalex.org/W2046032580,"We describe an approach to selectively activate a kinase in a specific protein complex or at a specific subcellular location within living cells and within minutes. This reveals the effects of specific kinase pathways without time for genetic compensation. The new technique, dubbed rapamycin-regulated targeted activation of pathways (RapRTAP), was used to dissect the role of Src kinase interactions with FAK and p130Cas in cell motility and morphodynamics. The overall effects of Src activation on cell morphology and adhesion dynamics were first quantified, without restricting effector access. Subsets of Src-induced behaviors were then attributed to specific interactions between Src and the two downstream proteins. Activation of Src in the cytoplasm versus at the cell membrane also produced distinct phenotypes. The conserved nature of the kinase site modified for RapRTAP indicates that the technique can be applied to many kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2029614399,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes post-translational modification, including O- and N-glycosylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation as it traffics through the secretory pathway. We have previously reported that copper promotes a change in the cellular localization of APP. We now report that copper increases the phosphorylation of endogenous APP at threonine 668 (Thr-668) in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. The level of APPT668-p (detected using a phospho-site-specific antibody) exhibited a copper-dependent increase. Using confocal microscopy imaging we demonstrate that the phospho-deficient mutant, Thr-668 to alanine (T668A), does not exhibit detectable copper-responsive APP trafficking. In contrast, mutating a serine to an alanine at residue 655 does not affect copper-responsive trafficking. We further investigated the importance of the Thr-668 residue in copper-responsive trafficking by treating SH-SY5Y cells with inhibitors for glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK3β) and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), the main kinases that phosphorylate APP at Thr-668 in neurons. Our results show that the GSK3β kinase inhibitors LiCl, SB 216763, and SB 415286 prevent copper-responsive APP trafficking. In contrast, the Cdk inhibitors Purvalanol A and B had no significant effect on copper-responsive trafficking in SH-SY5Y cells. In cultured primary hippocampal neurons, copper promoted APP re-localization to the axon, and this effect was inhibited by the addition of LiCl, indicating that a lithium-sensitive kinase(s) is involved in copper-responsive trafficking in hippocampal neurons. This is consistent with APP axonal transport to the synapse, where APP is involved in a number of functions. We conclude that copper promotes APP trafficking by promoting a GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells."

We searched for such factors using newly developed culture methods. Our culture system mimics the three-dimensional cellular structure of bone, consisting of collagen gel-embedded osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells, stromal ST2 cells on the gel as bone lining cells, and bone marrow cells. The gel-embedded MLO-Y4 cells inhibited the osteoclastogenesis induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 without modulating receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) production by ST2 cells, despite MLO-Y4 cells supported osteoclastogenesis in the absence of ST2 cells. In the bone marrow cell culture, the conditioned medium from MLO-Y4 cells decreased the capability of osteoclastic differentiation from the cells induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor. This decreased capability was concomitant with an increase in protein kinase R mRNA expression and an inhibition of c-Fos translation. These changes were partially normalized by the simultaneous addition of an anti-interferon (IFN)-β neutralizing antibody to MLO-Y4 cell conditioned medium. To study primary osteocytes, we prepared non-osteocytic cell-free osteocyte-enriched bone fragments (OEBFs).

https://openalex.org/W1996593497,"Background Many liver staging systems that include the tumor stage and the extent of liver function have been developed. However, prognosis assessment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. In this study, the performances of 7 staging systems were compared in a cohort of patients with HCC who underwent non-surgical treatment. Methods A total of 196 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent non-surgical treatment seen between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2007, were included. Performances of TNM sixth edition, Okuda, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP), Chinese University Prognostic Index (CUPI), Japan Integrated Staging (JIS), and China integrated score (CIS) have been compared and ranked using concordance index (c-index). Predictors of survival were identified using univariate and multivariate Cox model analyses. Results The median survival time for the cohort was 7.6 months (95% CI 5.6–9.7). The independent predictors of survival were performance status (P<.001), serum sodium (P<.001), alkaline phosphatase (P<.001), tumor diameter greater than 5 cm (P = .001), portal vein invasion (P<.001), lymph node metastasis (P = .025), and distant metastasis (P = .004). CUPI staging system had the best independent predictive power for survival when compared with the other six prognostic systems. Performance status and serum sodium improved the discriminatory ability of CUPI. Conclusion In our selected patient population whose main etiology is hepatitis B, CUPI was the most suitable staging system in predicting survival in patients with unresectable HCC. BCLC was the second top-ranking staging system. CLIP, JIS, CIS, and TNM sixth edition were not helpful in predicting survival outcome, and their use is not supported by our data."

This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for acute Toxoplasma gondii diseases in Taiwan. We conducted a nationwide population-based case-control study. Cases of acute human toxoplasmosis notified to the Taiwan Centers for Diseases Control (Taipei, Taiwan) during 2008–2013 were compared with controls that were randomly selected from healthy T. gondii-seronegative blood donors who participated in a nationwide T. gondii seroepidemiologic study during 2009–2010. Cases and controls were matched according to age, gender and residency at an 1∶8 ratio. Structured questionnaires were used to gather information regarding risk factors. A total of 30 laboratory-confirmed acute T. gondii disease cases and 224 controls were enrolled. The most common clinical manifestation of the cases was flu-like symptoms (n = 20), followed by central nervous system disease (n = 4), ocular diseases (n = 3), abortion (n = 2), and congenital infection (n = 1). Multivariate conditional logistic regression showed that raw clam consumption (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4–9.9) and having a cat in the household (adjusted OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 1.1–7.9) were two independent risk factors for acute T. gondii disease. We conclude that raw shellfish consumption and domestic cat exposure were risk factors for acquiring acute T. gondii diseases in Taiwan. This finding may guide future research and control policies."

Cdc42, the small Rho family GTPase recognized as the proximal glucose-specific trigger to elicit second-phase insulin secretion, signals downstream to activate the p21-activated kinase (PAK1), which then signals to Raf-1/MEK/ERK to induce filamentous actin (F-actin) remodeling, to ultimately mobilize insulin granules to the plasma membrane.

Significance: YES may provide a novel target for improvement of functional β cell mass. After glucose stimulation, insulin secretion from the pancreatic β cell occurs in two distinct phases. First-phase insulin secretion is initiated via glucose uptake through GLUT2 glucose transporters and subsequent glucose metabolism, leading to an elevated ATP:ADP ratio and closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels (1.Ashcroft F.M.

First-phase secretion occurs within ∼10 min of glucose stimulation as a kinetically defined and transient event, which is then followed by a sustained second-phase during which insulin is secreted for a longer duration but at a reduced rate.

SFKs are a family of protein-tyrosine kinases containing nine members: Src, YES, Fyn, Fgr, Lck, Hck, Blk, Lyn, and Frk. A multitude of cellular functions, including cellular motility, proliferation and survival, and cell-cell adhesion, are dependent on SFK activity. Importantly, many of these SFK-requiring processes also involve dynamic cytoskeleton remodeling (28.Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. et al.Cellular functions regulated by Src family kinases.Annu. Rev.

Given the known role of SFKs in actin dynamics and in the phosphorylation of both Cav-1 and βPix, we investigated the contribution of SFKs in the glucose-specific activation of Cdc42 and PAK1 and sustained insulin secretion in the β cell. In this study we show that glucose-stimulated Cdc42 activation, PAK1 phosphorylation, and GSIS are all dependent on SFK activity and identify YES kinase as the particular SFK involved in these processes. YES kinase is specifically activated by glucose within 1 min at the cell surface, occurring before Cdc42 activation. YES activation of Cdc42 represents one of the first-recognized proximal steps in glucose-specific release of insulin to date. Pancreatic human islets were obtained through the Integrated Islet Distribution Program.

MIN6 cells were washed twice and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (MKRBB) (15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml RIA-grade BSA; Sigma). SFK inhibitors (PP2 or SU-6656, 20 μm (EMD Millipore Chemicals)) were included during MKRBB incubations and treatments/stimulations with 1 mm pervanadate or 20 mm glucose, as indicated in the figure legends. After stimulation, cells were harvested in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. For GSIS using the diazoxide paradigm, MIN6 cells were preincubated with MKRBB for 2 h, treated with 250 μm diazoxide (Sigma), and stimulated with 40 mm KCl or 40 mm KCl plus 20 mm glucose as described (17.Kalwat M.A. Yoder S.M. Wang Z. Thurmond D.C. et al.A p21-activated kinase (PAK1) signaling cascade coordinately regulates F-actin remodeling and insulin granule exocytosis in pancreatic beta cells.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2013; 85: 808-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Insulin secreted was quantified using a rat insulin radioimmunoassay (Millipore). Two siRNA oligonucleotides for YES (J-040156-06 and J-040156-07) were purchased from Thermo (Dharmacon ON-TARGET plus siRNAs) along with the control non-targeting siRNA oligonucleotide (D-001810-01). YES siRNA (J-040156-07) was employed for the PAK1 and SFK activation assays. siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected into MIN6 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 100 nm. Forty-eight hours after transfection, MIN6 cells were incubated in MKRBB, stimulated with 20 mm glucose, and harvested in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for detection of SFK and PAK1 phosphorylation. Proteins were resolved by 10–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting. Non-stimulated A431 Cell Lysate (Millipore) was used as a positive control where indicated in the figure legends. Mouse anti-VAMP2 (Synaptic Systems) and rabbit anti-Syntaxin 4 (produced in-house, as described previously (31.Wiseman D.A. Kalwat M.A. Thurmond D.C. et al.Stimulus-induced S-nitrosylation of syntaxin 4 impacts insulin granule exocytosis.J. Biol.

Rabbit anti-GAPDH (Abcam), mouse anti-clathrin (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-Src, rabbit anti-phospho-SrcTyr-416, rabbit anti-phospho-SrcTyr-527, rabbit anti-PAK1, and rabbit anti-phospho-PAK1Thr-423 (Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit anti-RhoGDI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:1000. Src and phospho-Src antibodies from Cell Signaling Technologies cross-react with other SFKs and are thus referred to as SFK or phospho-SFK. Mouse anti-YES (BD Biosciences) was used at 1:500, and mouse anti-Cdc42 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used at 1:250. Rabbit anti-Fyn, rabbit anti-Hck, and rabbit anti-c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were all used at 1:200, whereas mouse anti-Rak/Frk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:100. Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were obtained from Bio-Rad and used at a concentration of 1:5000. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with ECL or ECL Prime (GE Healthcare) reagents and imaged using a Chemi-Doc gel documentation system (Bio-Rad). Bløk-PO Reagent (Millipore) was utilized to reduce noise in the phospho-specific blots. The Active Cdc42 Pull-Down and Detection Kit from Thermo was used to detect GTP-loaded Cdc42. Freshly prepared whole cell lysates (600 μg) were combined with 20 μg of GST-PAK1-PBD protein and rotated with the provided glutathione resin for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were then eluted from the resin after 3 washes with the kit lysis/binding/wash buffer and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membrane for immunoblotting with mouse anti-Cdc42. Data were normalized to GST-PAK1-PBD detected by Ponceau S staining in each matched lane to control for lane loading differences. All fractionation steps were completed at 4 °C using an established protocol (32.Kowluru A. Seavey S.E. Rhodes C.J. Metz S.A. et al.A novel regulatory mechanism for trimeric GTP-binding proteins in the membrane and secretory granule fractions of human and rodent beta cells.Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In brief, after glucose stimulation MIN6 cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested with 500 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). Cell lysates were disrupted by 10 strokes through a 27-gauge needle and centrifuged at 0.9 × g for 10 min. Post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 5500 × g for 15 min, and the subsequent supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the secretory granule fraction in the pellet. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosolic fraction. To isolate the plasma membrane fraction, the post-nuclear pellet was combined with 1 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2) and 2 ml of Buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2). The resulting mixture was overlaid with Buffer A and centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 1 h. The sucrose gradient achieved with Buffers A and B yielded an interface containing the plasma membrane fraction. This interface was collected, washed twice with homogenization buffer, and collected via centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. Both the plasma membrane and secretory granule pellets were resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. MIN6 cells plated onto glass coverslips were incubated in MKRBB with or without 20 μm SU-6656 for 2 h and treated for 5 min with 1 mm pervanadate where indicated in the figure legends. Cells were immediately fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed and permeabilized cells were blocked in a 1% BSA, 5% donkey serum solution for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Rabbit anti-Src and rabbit anti-phospho-SrcTyr-416 (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:100. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS; during the second wash, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was added to stain nuclei. Using Vectashield, coverslips were mounted onto slides for confocal fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescent images from at least five fields of each condition were captured using an Olympus FV1000-MPE confocal microscope (single-channel scanning, 60× objective, 2× zoom). ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) was used to prepare final images. Total RNA from MIN6 cells and mouse spleen was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 5% of the product was used for subsequent PCR. PCR was performed with BioMix Red (Bioline) for 30 cycles: 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min with a final 10-min elongation step at 71 °C. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels with GAPDH used as a positive reaction control. Using PrimerBank, specific primers (Table 1) for each of the nine Src kinase family members were designed to be unique to that SFK with no cross-reactivity to the other eight family members (optimal Tm = 60–63 °C).TABLE 1Primer sequences for Src family kinase membersFamily member5′ Primer3′ PrimerFynACCTCCATCCCGAACTACAACCATAAAGCGCCACAAACAGTGLckCCTGCACAGTTATGAGCCCTCCGAAGTTGAAGGGAATGAAGCCLynAGTGCAGGAGCTTTCCTTATCACGAGGAGAGATGTAATAGCCACCHckTCGTTGTCTGTTCGAGACTTTGTCTTGTAGTGGAGCACGAGTTSrcCAATGCCAAGGGCCTAAATGTTGTTTGGAGTAGTAAGCCACGAYesATGCTACAGTTGCCCCGACTCCAAAAGGAGTCACCCCTGABlkTTGTGGCCCCAGTAGAGACTCGGGGAGATGTAATAGCCTCCAFgrCTCAAGGCCGGACTTCGTCCCCACCAGTCATACTCCGTATTGFrkGAAGGGTGACTTTTCCCTCTCAGTTGTGGTGTAGTAGTTCACGAA Open table in a new tab Cleared MIN6 detergent lysates (2 mg) were combined with 2 μg of mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (Clone 4G10, Millipore) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of Protein G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional 2 h. Normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a negative control. After 3 washes with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, the resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting mouse anti-YES as described earlier. Secondary antibody incubation and immunoreactive band visualization was completed as stated previously. Adenoviral delivery plasmids were constructed by insertion of the annealed complementary oligonucleotide sequence of siCtrl or siYES (Dharmacon: J-040156–07) into the 5′-XhoI and 3′-SpeI sites of the pSilencer Adeno-CMV vector (Ambion) and verified by DNA sequencing analysis. High purity cesium chloride viral particles were obtained from Viraquest Inc. (North Liberty, IA), and viruses were packaged with GFP to identify transduced cells. shCtrl-Ad or shYES-Ad viral particles were used at a multiplicity of infection = 100. Pancreatic mouse islets were isolated as described previously (33.Lacy P.E.

MIN6 cells were transduced for 2 h. GFP fluorescence was visualized in >95% of MIN6 cells and ∼70% of cells of the islets (including those at the islet core) in all experiments. GFP-positive islets were handpicked and washed twice in KRBH. Groups of 10 islets were preincubated in KRBH for 2 h at 37 °C followed by a 5-min treatment with 250 μm diazoxide (Sigma). Islets were stimulated with 35 mm KCl or 35 mm KCl plus 16.7 mm glucose for 30 min. Supernatants were collected to measure insulin secretion, and islets were harvested in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to determine islet insulin content. Data were evaluated for statistical significance using a two-tailed Student's t test or analysis of variance (with Tukey's or Dunnett's test as a post hoc analysis).

https://openalex.org/W1977623849,"Mating systems are diverse in animals, notably in crustaceans, but can be inferred from a limited set of parameters. Baeza and Thiel (2007) proposed a model predicting mating systems of symbiotic crustaceans with three host characteristics and the risk of predation. These authors proposed five mating systems, ranging from monogamy to polygynandry (where multiple mating occurs for both genders). Using microsatellite loci, we tested the putatively mating system of the ectoparasite crab Dissodactylus primitivus. We determined the mating frequencies of males and females, parentage assignment (COLONY & GERUD software) as well as the contents of female spermathecae. Our results are globally consistent with the model of Baeza and Thiel and showed, together with previous aquarium experiments, that this ectoparasite evolved a polygamous mating system where males and females move between hosts for mate search. Parentage analyses revealed that polyandry is frequent and concerns more than 60% of clutches, with clutches being fertilized by up to 6 different fathers. Polygyny is supported by the detection of eight males having sired two different broods. We also detected a significant paternity skew in 92% of the multipaternal broods. Moreover, this skew is probably higher than the estimation from the brood because additional alleles were detected in most of spermathecae. This high skew could be explained by several factors as sperm competition or cryptic female choice. Our genetic data, combined with previous anatomic analyses, provide consistent arguments to suggest sperm precedence in D. primitivus."

We show that cytokines stimulate H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX formation) in rat islets and insulinoma cells in a nitric oxide- and ATM-dependent manner. In contrast to the well documented role of ATM in DNA repair, ATM does not appear to participate in the repair of nitric oxide-induced DNA damage. Instead, nitric oxide-induced γH2AX formation correlates temporally with the onset of irreversible DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis.

Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is characterized by an inflammatory reaction in and around pancreatic islets that is followed by the selective destruction of insulin-secreting β cells (1.Gepts W. et al.Pathologic anatomy of the pancreas in juvenile diabetes mellitus.Diabetes. 1965; 14: 619-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, released from infiltrating macrophages, are believed to participate in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus by directly damaging β cells (2.Mandrup-Poulsen T.

The ability to recover from cytokine-induced damage was originally identified in studies where the inhibitory actions of a 15-h incubation with IL-1 on insulin secretion were found to be reversed if the cytokine was removed by washing and the islets were allowed to incubate for an additional 4 days in the absence of the IL-1 (23.Comens P.G.

These studies establish nitric oxide as the primary effector molecule mediating cytokine-induced damage because inhibitors of iNOS prevent cytokine-induced damage and β cells have the capacity to recover from cytokine-induced damage by inhibiting nitric oxide generation in the presence of cytokines.

Under conditions in which cytokine-mediated damage is irreversible, the β cell is ultimately committed to death by apoptosis (13.Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R.

In this study, the effects of cytokine treatment on activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and the role of this response in the repair of DNA damage in β cells were examined. Nitric oxide, produced endogenously following iNOS induction or added exogenously using chemical donors induces the phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX on Ser-139. H2AX is a component of the DDR that is phosphorylated (forming γH2AX) in response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) (25.Ciccia A.

Although these findings implicate DSB formation and the activation of the DDR in response to nitric oxide, ATM does not appear to participate in the repair of nitric oxide-induced DNA damage or the activation of pathways that are required for DNA repair in β cells. In contrast, there is a marked increase in γH2AX formation after 36 h of IL-1 treatment, a time at which nitric oxide-induced damage becomes irreversible and β cells are committed to death by apoptosis (13.Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R.

Inhibition of ATM under these conditions attenuates IL-1-induced caspase activation, suggesting that ATM may be the kinase responsible for the induction of β cell apoptosis under conditions of irreversible DNA damage in cytokine-treated β cells. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Wild-type and ATM−/− mice (129S6/SvEvTac background) were from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The insulinoma cell line INS 832/13 was obtained from Chris Newgard (Duke University, Durham NC). RPMI 1640 medium, Connaught Medical Research Laboratories (CMRL) 1066 medium, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, HEPES, penicillin, streptomycin and β-mercaptoethanol were purchased from Invitrogen. 0.05% trypsin in 0.53 mm EDTA was purchased from Corning (Corning, NY), and human recombinant IL-1β and rat IFNγ were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ).

Hydrogen peroxide, camptothecin, and KU-55933 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies used and their sources were as follows: mouse anti-phospho-H2AX (Ser-139, γH2AX) (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA); mouse anti-phospho-ATM (Ser-1981), mouse anti-ATM, and rabbit anti-H2AX (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (Invitrogen); rabbit anti-ACTIVE-JNK (Promega, Madison, WI); rabbit anti-PARP and rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); rabbit anti-PAR (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD); guinea pig anti-insulin (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA); HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, and DyLight-405 goat anti-guinea pig antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Islets were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats by collagenase digestion as described previously (29.Kelly C.B. Blair L.A. Corbett J.A. Scarim A.L. et al.Isolation of islets of Langerhans from rodent pancreas.Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 83: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). Islets were cultured in complete CMRL-1066 medium (CMRL-1066 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). INS 832/13 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were cultured at 37 °C at 5% CO2 and 95% air. INS 832/13 cells were detached from culture flasks using 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA and plated at a density of 500,000 cells/ml. Cells/islets were washed with PBS and lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm NaF, and Halt protease inhibitor mixture (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing and then sonicated and centrifuged (16,000 × g) at 4 °C for 20 min. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Lysates were mixed with 6× Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked in 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following dilutions of primary antibodies: γH2AX (1:2000), H2AX (1:10,000), phospho-JNK (1:2000), PARP (1:1000), PAR (1:1000), cleaved caspase 3 (1:500), ATM (1:1000), and GAPDH (1:10,000). Membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies for 45 min at the following concentrations: donkey anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000) and donkey anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (1:7000). This was followed by detection using enhanced chemiluminescence. Nitric oxide generation was assessed by measuring the accumulation of its stable metabolite nitrite in culture supernatants using a Griess assay (30.Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L.

Cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 45 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice, and then blocked using 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Primary antibodies to γH2AX, phospho-ATM, and insulin were used at 1:500, 1:500, and 1:100, respectively. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, and DyLight-405 goat anti-guinea pig secondary antibodies were used at 1:400, 1:400, and 1:200, respectively. DAPI was used as a nuclear stain (0.5 ng/ml in PBS for 10 min). Images were captured using a Nikon eclipse 90i confocal microscope. For quantification of γH2AX-positive cells, an intensity threshold was set using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), and positive cells were counted manually. DNA damage was measured using a comet assay (33.Tice R.R. Andrews P.W. Hirai O. Singh N.P. et al.The single cell gel (SCG) assay: an electrophoretic technique for the detection of DNA damage in individual cells.Adv. Exp. Med.

Following treatment, cells were detached using PBS, suspended in 0.6% low melting point agarose, and layered onto slides precoated with 1.0% agarose. Samples were lysed (2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-base (pH 10.0), 0.1% SDS, and 1.45% Triton X-100) overnight at 4 °C and incubated in an alkaline solution (0.3 m NaOH and 1 mm EDTA (pH >13)) for 45 min. Electrophoresis at 25 V and 300 mA was conducted for 25 min, and the slides were washed three times in 0.4 m Tris base (pH 7.5). Slides were stained with ethidium bromide (2 μg/ml), and images were captured using a Nikon eclipse 80i. DNA damage was quantified as mean tail moment using the Comet Assay Software Project (CASP) program from 30–50 cells/condition. Total RNA from whole cell lysates was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using oligo(dTs) and the SuperScript preamplification system according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using SsoFast EvaGreen supermix (Bio-Rad) and a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time system according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Primers used were as follows: GADD45α, 5′-GTGTGCTGGTGACGAACCCACAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGTTCGGGGAATCACCGTCCG-3′ (reverse). Changes in GADD45α were normalized to GAPDH. The primers were as follows: GAPDH, 5′-TCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGCCG-3′ (forward) and 5′TGAAGGGGTCGTTGATGGCAACA-3′ (reverse). Primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The Fast Micromethod was used to evaluate the extent of DNA damage (34.Schröder H.C. Batel R. Schwertner H. Boreiko O. Müller W.E. et al.Fast micromethod DNA single-strand-break assay.Methods Mol.

INS 832/13 cells (400,000/0.8 ml in 12-well plates) were detached using 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA following the indicated treatments. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)), giving an approximate density of 200,000 cells/ml. In a volume of 25 μl (5000 cells), cells were transferred to 96-well plates. 25 μl of TE buffer containing Pico-Green (1:50 Pico-Green/TE buffer, Invitrogen) was added, and the cells were incubated for 20 min in the dark. Following the incubation with Pico-Green, 250 μl of NaOH solution (1 mm NaOH in 20 mm EDTA, made freshly) was added to give a final pH of 12.30 ± 0.02 in each well. The pH of the NaOH solution was attuned beforehand to ensure that the appropriate pH was achieved in the 96-well plate (34.Schröder H.C. Batel R. Schwertner H. Boreiko O. Müller W.E. et al.Fast micromethod DNA single-strand-break assay.Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 314: 287-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Immediately after addition of the NaOH solution, the loss of Pico-Green binding (extent of DNA damage) was detected by measuring fluorescence at an excitation of 480 nm and emission of 520 nm. DNA damage measured using the Fast Micromethod was expressed as strand scission factor, which is defined as the log (percent of dsDNA in sample/percent of dsDNA in control), calculated following a 20-min incubation with NaOH. All transfection reagents and siRNA were purchased from Invitrogen. INS 832/13 cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA targeting ATM or a scramble sequence using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After 24 h of incubation, the transfection medium was removed, and fresh medium was added to the wells. Cells were allowed to incubate in fresh medium for an additional 24 h before treatment. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. The minimum level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Histone variant H2AX is one of the core histone proteins that functions to maintain genomic integrity (26.Pinto D.M. Flaus A. et al.Structure and function of histone H2AX.Subcell. Biochem. 2010; 50: 55-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of H2AX on serine 139 (termed γH2AX) occurs rapidly after induction of DNA DSBs and serves as an initiation site for the assembly of DNA repair complexes (27.Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. et al.DNA double-stranded breaks induce histone H2AX phosphorylation on serine 139.J. Biol.

Because nitric oxide induces DNA damage, the effects of cytokines on γH2AX formation in β cells were examined. Treatment of isolated rat islets with the cytokines IL-1 and IFNγ for 24 h results in a >3.5-fold increase in γH2AX formation (Fig. 1, A and B) that occurs under conditions in which there is a 5-fold increase in nitric oxide production (Fig. 1C).

Among these enzymes is ovarian tumor domain-containing protein 1 (OTU1). Here, we report the structural basis for interaction between VCP and OTU1. The crystal structure of the ubiquitin regulatory X-like (UBXL) domain of OTU1 (UBXLOTU1) complexed to the N-terminal domain of VCP (NVCP) at 1.8-Å resolution reveals that UBXLOTU1 adopts a ubiquitin-like fold and binds at the interface of two subdomains of NVCP using the 39GYPP42 loop of UBXLOTU1 with the two prolines in cis- and trans-configurations, respectively. A mutagenesis study shows that this loop is not only critical for the interaction with VCP but also for its role in the ERAD pathway. Negative staining EM shows that one molecule of OTU1 binds to one VCP hexamer, and isothermal titration calorimetry suggests that the two proteins bind with a KD of 0.71 μm. Analytical size exclusion chromatography and isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrates that OTU1 can bind VCP in both the presence and absence of a heterodimer formed by ubiquitin fusion degradation protein 1 and nuclear localization protein 4.

However, the neural basis of successful neurofeedback learning remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed changes in effective brain connectivity associated with neurofeedback training of visual cortex activity. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we found that training participants to increase visual cortex activity was associated with increased effective connectivity between the visual cortex and the superior parietal lobe. Specifically, participants who learned to control activity in their visual cortex showed increased top-down control of the superior parietal lobe over the visual cortex, and at the same time reduced bottom-up processing. These results are consistent with efficient employment of top-down visual attention and imagery, which were the cognitive strategies used by participants to increase their visual cortex activity."
https://openalex.org/W1998349112,"17ß-Estradiol, an epigenetic modulator, is involved in the increased prevalence of migraine in women. Together with the prophylactic efficacy of valproate, which influences DNA methylation and histone modification, this points to the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic studies are often performed on leukocytes, but it is unclear to what extent methylation is similar in other tissues. Therefore, we investigated methylation of migraine-related genes that might be epigenetically regulated (CGRP-ergic pathway, estrogen receptors, endothelial NOS, as well as MTHFR) in different migraine-related tissues and compared this to methylation in rat as well as human leukocytes. Further, we studied whether 17ß-estradiol has a prominent role in methylation of these genes. Female rats (n = 35) were ovariectomized or sham-operated and treated with 17β-estradiol or placebo. DNA was isolated and methylation was assessed through bisulphite treatment and mass spectrometry. Human methylation data were obtained using the Illumina 450k genome-wide methylation array in 395 female subjects from a population-based cohort study. We showed that methylation of the Crcp, Calcrl, Esr1 and Nos3 genes is tissue-specific and that methylation in leukocytes was not correlated to that in other tissues. Interestingly, the interindividual variation in methylation differed considerably between genes and tissues. Furthermore we showed that methylation in human leukocytes was similar to that in rat leukocytes in our genes of interest, suggesting that rat may be a good model to study human DNA methylation in tissues that are difficult to obtain.

Under certain conditions, modern corals produce calcite as a secondary precipitate to fill pore space. However, coral construction of primary skeletons from calcite has yet to be demonstrated. We report a calcitic primary skeleton produced by the modern scleractinian coral Acropora tenuis. When uncalcified juveniles were incubated from the larval stage in seawater with low mMg/Ca levels, the juveniles constructed calcitic crystals in parts of the primary skeleton such as the septa; the deposits were observable under Raman microscopy. Using scanning electron microscopy, we observed different crystal morphologies of aragonite and calcite in a single juvenile skeleton. Quantitative analysis using X-ray diffraction showed that the majority of the skeleton was composed of aragonite even though we had exposed the juveniles to manipulated seawater before their initial crystal nucleation and growth processes. Our results indicate that the modern scleractinian coral Acropora mainly produces aragonite skeletons in both aragonite and calcite seas, but also has the ability to use calcite for part of its skeletal growth when incubated in calcite seas."

The majority of these infections are caused by HIV-1 subtype C. Using genotyping methods we characterized HIV-1 subtypes of the gag p24 and pol PR and RT fragments, from a cohort of female participants in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. These participants were recruited as part of a study to assess the combined brain and behavioural effects of HIV and early childhood trauma. The partial HIV-1 gag and pol fragments of 84 participants were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Different online tools and manual phylogenetic analysis were used for HIV-1 subtyping. Online tools included: REGA HIV Subtyping tool version 3; Recombinant Identification Program (RIP); Context-based Modeling for Expeditious Typing (COMET); jumping profile Hidden Markov Models (jpHMM) webserver; and subtype classification using evolutionary algorithms (SCUEAL). HIV-1 subtype C predominates within the cohort with a prevalence of 93.8%. We also show, for the first time, the presence of circulating BC strains in at least 4.6% of our study cohort. In addition, we detected transmitted resistance associated mutations in 4.6% of analysed sequences. With tourism and migration rates to South Africa currently very high, we are detecting more and more HIV-1 URFs within our study populations. It is stil unclear what role these unique strains will play in terms of long term antiretroviral treatment and what challenges they will pose to vaccine development.

We combined our knowledge of pea germplasm diversity with that of the eIF4E gene to identify novel genetic diversity.Germplasm of 2803 pea accessions was screened for eIF4E intron 3 length polymorphism, resulting in the detection of four eIF4E(A-B-C-S) variants, whose distribution was geographically structured. The eIF4E(A) variant conferring resistance to the P1 PSbMV pathotype was found in 53 accessions (1.9%), of which 15 were landraces from India, Afghanistan, Nepal, and 7 were from Ethiopia. A newly discovered variant, eIF4E(B), was present in 328 accessions (11.7%) from Ethiopia (29%), Afghanistan (23%), India (20%), Israel (25%) and China (39%). The eIF4E(C) variant was detected in 91 accessions (3.2% of total) from India (20%), Afghanistan (33%), the Iberian Peninsula (22%) and the Balkans (9.3%). The eIF4E(S) variant for susceptibility predominated as the wild type. Sequencing of 73 samples, identified 34 alleles at the whole gene, 26 at cDNA and 19 protein variants, respectively. Fifteen alleles were virologically tested and 9 alleles (eIF4E(A-1-2-3-4-5-6-7), eIF4E(B-1), eIF4E(C-2)) conferred resistance to the P1 PSbMV pathotype.This work identified novel eIF4E alleles within geographically structured pea germplasm and indicated their independent evolution from the susceptible eIF4E(S1) allele. Despite high variation present in wild Pisum accessions, none of them possessed resistance alleles, supporting a hypothesis of distinct mode of evolution of resistance in wild as opposed to crop species.

https://openalex.org/W2048286312,"The human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important therapeutic target in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab have been approved for the treatment of such patients. Despite these advances, the duration of response in some patients can be limited. Since, EGFR is capable of forming heterodimers with the other members of the HER (Human epidermal receptor) family, it is important to investigate the co-expression and prognostic significance of all members of the HER family in colorectal cancer patients. The expression of the HER family members were determined in tumour specimens from 86 patients with Dukes' C and D (metastatic) colon cancer using immunohistochemistry. Sections were scored by the percentage of positive tumour cells and intensity of staining. Their associations with clinicopathological parameters, and overall survival and disease free survival were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis. Overall, 43%, 77%, 52% and 92% of the cases were EGFR, HER-2, HER-3 and HER-4 positive respectively. Interestingly, 35%, 24%, 43%, and 18% of the cases had co-expression of EGFR/HER-2, EGFR/HER-3, EGFR/HER-4 and all four members of the HER family respectively. Of these, only the expression of EGFR and co-expression of EGFR/HER-4 were associated with poorer disease-free survival in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Co-expression of all members of the HER family in colon cancer supports the need for further investigations on their predictive value for response to therapy with anti-EGFR mAbs and whether such sub-population of patients may benefit from therapy with the new generation of pan-HER inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1982941652,"Selectivity is a critical issue in molecular recognition. However, design rules that underlie selectivity are often not well understood. Here, we studied five classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that contain the motif KRx(W/F/Y)xxAF and selectively bind to the minor site of importin α. The selectivity for the minor site is dissected by building structural models for the NLS-importin α complexes and analyzing the positive design and negative design in the NLSs. In our models, the KR residues of the motif occupy the P1' and P2' pockets of importin α, respectively, forming hydrogen-bonding and cation-π interactions. The aromatic residue at the P4' position plays dual roles in the selectivity for the minor site: by forming π-stacking with W357 of importin α to reinforce the minor-site binding; and by clashing with the P5 pocket in the major binding site. The F residue at the P8' position occupies a deep pocket, providing additional stabilization. The P7' position sits on a saddle next to the P8' pocket and hence requires a small residue; the A residue fulfills this requirement. The principal ideas behind these blind predictions turn out to be correct in an evaluation against subsequently available X-ray structures for the NLS-importin α complexes, but some details are incorrect. These results illustrate that the selectivity for the minor site can be achieved via a variety of design rules."
https://openalex.org/W2069726069,"Proinflammatory high-density lipoprotein (p-HDL) is a biomarker of cardiovascular disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic states of oxidative stress that many consider to play a role in forming p-HDL. To measure p-HDL, apolipoprotein (apo) B containing lipoproteins are precipitated. Supernatant HDL is incubated with an oxidant/LDL or an oxidant alone and rates of HDL oxidation monitored with dichlorofluorescein (DCFH). Although apoB precipitation is convenient for isolating HDL, the resulting supernatant matrix likely influences HDL oxidation. To determine effects of supernatants on p-HDL measurements we purified HDL from plasma from SCD subjects by anion exchange (AE) chromatography, determined its rate of oxidation relative to supernatant HDL. SCD decreased total cholesterol but not triglycerides or HDL and increased cell-free (cf) hemoglobin (Hb) and xanthine oxidase (XO). HDL isolated by AE-HPLC had lower p-HDL levels than HDL in supernatants after apoB precipitation. XO+xanthine (X) and cf Hb accelerated purified HDL oxidation. Although the plate and AE-HPLC assays both showed p-HDL directly correlated with cf-Hb in SCD plasma, the plate assay yielded p-HDL data that was influenced more by cf-Hb than AE-HPLC generated p-HDL data. The AE-HPLC p-HDL assay reduces the influence of the supernatants and shows that SCD increases p-HDL."
https://openalex.org/W2094780958,"Feedback-related negativity (FRN) is believed to be an important electrophysiology index of ""external"" negative feedback processing. Previous studies on FRN in obsessive-compulsive (OC) individuals are scarce and controversial. In these studies, anxiety symptoms were not evaluated in detail. However, OC disorders have a number of radical differences from anxiety disorders. It is necessary to study FRN and its neuroanatomical correlates in OC individuals without anxious symptoms.A total of 628 undergraduate students completed an OC questionnaire. We chose 14 students who scored in the upper 10% and 14 students who scored in the lowest 10% without anxiety symptoms as a subclinical OC group (SOC) and a low obsessive-compulsive group (LOC). The students all performed the revised Iowa Gambling Task. We used the event-related potentials (ERP) and standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) to track external negative feedback processing and its substrate in the brain.Our study revealed poorer decision-making ability and greater FRN amplitudes in SOC subjects compared with LOC controls. The SOC subjects displayed anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) hyperactivation during the loss feedback condition. Specifically, we found an intercorrelation of current source density during the loss condition between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and aPFC in the LOC subjects but not in the SOC group.Our results support the notion that overactive external feedback error processing may reflect a candidate endophenotype of OC. We also provide important information on the dysfunction in the interaction between aPFC and dACC in populations with OC. Nevertheless, the findings support that OC may be distinguished from other anxiety disorders using a new electrophysiology perspective."

https://openalex.org/W2010299894,"Introduction The difficulties in the management of the blunt chest wall trauma patient in the Emergency Department due to the development of late complications are well recognised in the literature. Pre-injury anti-platelet therapy has been previously investigated as a risk factor for poor outcomes following traumatic head injury, but not in the blunt chest wall trauma patient cohort. The aim of this study was to investigate pre-injury anti-platelet therapy as a risk factor for the development of complications in the recovery phase following blunt chest wall trauma. Methods A retrospective study was completed in which the medical notes were analysed of all blunt chest wall trauma patients presenting to a large trauma centre in Wales in 2012 and 2013. Using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis, pre-injury platelet therapy was investigated as a risk factor for the development of complications following blunt chest wall trauma. Previously identified risk factors were included in the analysis to address the influence of confounding. Results A total of 1303 isolated blunt chest wall trauma patients presented to the ED in Morriston Hospital in 2012 and 2013 with complications recorded in 144 patients (11%). On multi-variable analysis, pre-injury anti-platelet therapy was found to be a significant risk factor for the development of complications following isolated blunt chest wall trauma (odds ratio: 16.9; 95% confidence intervals: 8.2–35.2). As in previous studies patient age, number of rib fractures, chronic lung disease and pre-injury anti-coagulant use were also found to be significant risk factors. Conclusions Pre-injury anti-platelet therapy is being increasingly used as a first line treatment for a number of conditions and there is a concurrent increase in trauma in the elderly population. Pre-injury anti-platelet therapy should be considered as a risk factor for the development of complications by clinicians managing blunt chest wall trauma."
https://openalex.org/W2053135714,"A correlation between in vivo and in vitro virus control mediated by CD8+ T-cell populations has been demonstrated by CD8 T-cell-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 and SIV replication in vitro in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from infected humans and non-human primates (NHPs), respectively. Here, the breadth and specificity of T-cell responses induced following vaccination with replication-defective adenovirus serotype 35 (Ad35) vectors containing a fusion protein of Gag, reverse transcriptase (RT), Integrase (Int) and Nef (Ad35-GRIN) and Env (Ad35-ENV), derived from HIV-1 subtype A isolates, was assessed in 25 individuals. The vaccine induced responses to a median of 4 epitopes per vaccinee. We correlated the CD8 responses to conserved vs. variable regions with the ability to inhibit a panel of 7 HIV-1 isolates representing multiple clades in a virus inhibition assay (VIA). The results indicate that targeting immunodominant responses to highly conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome may result in an increased ability to inhibit multiple clades of HIV-1 in vitro. The data further validate the use of the VIA to screen and select future HIV vaccine candidates. Moreover, our data suggest that future T cell-focused vaccine design should aim to induce immunodominant responses to highly conserved regions of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2020086896,"Asparagine is formed by two structurally distinct asparagine synthetases in prokaryotes. One is the ammonia-utilizing asparagine synthetase A (AsnA), and the other is asparagine synthetase B (AsnB) that uses glutamine or ammonia as a nitrogen source. In a previous investigation using sequence-based analysis, we had shown that Leishmania spp. possess asparagine-tRNA synthetase paralog asparagine synthetase A (LdASNA) that is ammonia-dependent. Here, we report the cloning, expression, and kinetic analysis of ASNA from Leishmania donovani. Interestingly, LdASNA was both ammonia- and glutamine-dependent. To study the physiological role of ASNA in Leishmania, gene deletion mutations were attempted via targeted gene replacement. Gene deletion of LdASNA showed a growth delay in mutants. However, chromosomal null mutants of LdASNA could not be obtained as the double transfectant mutants showed aneuploidy. These data suggest that LdASNA is essential for survival of the Leishmania parasite. LdASNA enzyme was recalcitrant toward crystallization so we instead crystallized and solved the atomic structure of its close homolog from Trypanosoma brucei (TbASNA) at 2.2 Å. A very significant conservation in active site residues is observed between TbASNA and Escherichia coli AsnA. It is evident that the absence of an LdASNA homolog from humans and its essentiality for the parasites make LdASNA a novel drug target."
https://openalex.org/W1995541947,"Temporally distributed (“spaced”) learning can be twice as efficient as massed learning. This “spacing effect” occurs with a broad spectrum of learning materials, with humans of different ages, with non-human vertebrates and also invertebrates. This indicates, that very basic learning mechanisms are at work (“generality”). Although most studies so far focused on very narrow spacing interval ranges, there is some evidence for a non-monotonic behavior of this “spacing effect” (“nonlinearity”) with optimal spacing intervals at different time scales. In the current study we focused both the nonlinearity aspect by using a broad range of spacing intervals and the generality aspect by using very different learning/practice domains: Participants learned German-Japanese word pairs and performed visual acuity tests. For each of six groups we used a different spacing interval between learning/practice units from 7 min to 24 h in logarithmic steps. Memory retention was studied in three consecutive final tests, one, seven and 28 days after the final learning unit. For both the vocabulary learning and visual acuity performance we found a highly significant effect of the factor spacing interval on the final test performance. In the 12 h-spacing-group about 85% of the learned words stayed in memory and nearly all of the visual acuity gain was preserved. In the 24 h-spacing-group, in contrast, only about 33% of the learned words were retained and the visual acuity gain dropped to zero. The very similar patterns of results from the two very different learning/practice domains point to similar underlying mechanisms. Further, our results indicate spacing in the range of 12 hours as optimal. A second peak may be around a spacing interval of 20 min but here the data are less clear. We discuss relations between our results and basic learning at the neuronal level."
https://openalex.org/W2021044074,"In 2013, a novel avian influenza H7N9 virus was identified in human in China. The antigenically distinct H7N9 surface glycoproteins raised concerns about lack of cross-protective neutralizing antibodies. Epitope-specific preexisting T-cell immunity was one of the protective mechanisms in pandemic 2009 H1N1 even in the absence of cross-protective antibodies. Hence, the assessment of preexisting CD4+ T-cell immunity to conserved epitopes shared between H7N9 and human influenza A viruses (IAV) is critical. A comparative whole proteome-wide immunoinformatics analysis was performed to predict the CD4+ T-cell epitopes that are commonly conserved within the proteome of H7N9 in reference to IAV subtypes (H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2). The CD4+ T-cell epitopes that are commonly conserved (∼ 556) were further screened against the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) to validate their immunogenic potential. This analysis revealed that 45.5% (253 of 556) epitopes are experimentally proven to induce CD4+ T-cell memory responses. In addition, we also found that 23.3% of CD4+ T-cell epitopes have ≥ 90% of sequence homology with experimentally defined CD8+ T-cell epitopes. We also conducted the population coverage analysis across different ethnicities using commonly conserved CD4+ T-cell epitopes and corresponding HLA-DRB1 alleles. Interestingly, the indigenous populations from Canada, United States, Mexico and Australia exhibited low coverage (28.65% to 45.62%) when compared with other ethnicities (57.77% to 94.84%). In summary, the present analysis demonstrate an evidence on the likely presence of preexisting T-cell immunity in human population and also shed light to understand the potential risk of H7N9 virus among indigenous populations, given their high susceptibility during previous pandemic influenza events. This information is crucial for public health policy, in targeting priority groups for immunization programs."

https://openalex.org/W2011772216,"To identify optimal cut-off points of fasting plasma glucose for two-step strategy in screening of undiagnosed diabetes in Chinese people, data were selected from two cross-sectional studies of Metabolic Syndrome in Zhejiang Province of China, Zhejiang Statistical Yearbook (2010), and published literatures. Two-step strategy was used among 17437 subjects sampled from population to screen undiagnosed diabetes. Effectiveness (proportion of cases identified), costs (including medical and non-medical costs), and efficiency (cost per case identified) of these different two-step screening strategies were evaluated. This study found the sensitivities of all the two-step screening strategies with further Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) at different Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) cut-off points from 5.0 to 7.0 (mmol/L) ranged from 0.66 to 0.91. For the FPG point of 5.0 mmol/L, 91 percent of undiagnosed cases were identified. The total cost of detecting one undiagnosed diabetes case ranged from 547.1 to 1294.5 CNY/case, and the strategy with FPG at cut-off point of 6.1 (mmol/L) resulted in the least cost. Considering both sensitivity and cost of screening diabetes, FPG cut-off point at 5.4 mmol/L was optimized for the two-step strategy. In conclusion, different optimal cut-off points of FPG for two-step strategy in screening of undiagnosed diabetes should be used for different screening purposes."

https://openalex.org/W2042927360,"Palmitoylation at cysteine residues is the only known reversible form of lipidation and has been implicated in protein membrane association as well as function. Many palmitoylated proteins have regulatory roles in dynamic cellular processes, including membrane fusion. Recently, we identified Env7 as a conserved and palmitoylated protein kinase involved in negative regulation of membrane fusion at the lysosomal vacuole. Env7 contains a palmitoylation consensus sequence, and substitution of its three consecutive cysteines (Cys(13)-Cys(15)) results in a non-palmitoylated and cytoplasmic Env7. In this study, we further dissect and define the role(s) of individual cysteines of the consensus sequence in various properties of Env7 in vivo. Our results indicate that more than one of the cysteines serve as palmitoylation substrates, and any pairwise combination is essential and sufficient for near wild type levels of Env7 palmitoylation, membrane localization, and phosphorylation. Furthermore, individually, each cysteine can serve as a minimum requirement for distinct aspects of Env7 behavior and function in cells. Cys(13) is sufficient for membrane association, Cys(15) is essential for the fusion regulatory function of membrane-bound Env7, and Cys(14) and Cys(15) are redundantly essential for protection of membrane-bound Env7 from proteasomal degradation. A role for Cys(14) and Cys(15) in correct sorting at the membrane is also discussed. Thus, palmitoylation at the N-terminal cysteines of Env7 directs not only its membrane association but also its stability, phosphorylation, and cellular function."
