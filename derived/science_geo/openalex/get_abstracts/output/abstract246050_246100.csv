This transporter consists of two protein components, xCT and 4F2 heavy chain, and the former is predicted to mediate the transport activity. This transporter plays a pivotal role for maintaining the intracellular GSH levels and extracellular cystine/cysteine redox balance in cultured cells. To clarify the physiological roles of this transporter in vivo, we generated and characterized mice lacking xCT. The xCT–/– mice were healthy in appearance and fertile. However, cystine concentration in plasma was significantly higher in these mice, compared with that in the littermate xCT–/– mice, while there was no significant difference in plasma cysteine concentration. Plasma GSH level in xCT–/– mice was lower than that in the xCT–/– mice. The embryonic fibroblasts derived from xCT–/– mice failed to survive in routine culture medium, and 2-mercaptoethanol was required for survival and growth. When 2-mercaptoethanol was removed from the culture medium, cysteine and GSH in these cells dramatically decreased, and cells started to die within 24 h. N-Acetyl cysteine also rescued xCT–/–-derived cells and permitted growth. These results demonstrate that system x–c contributes to maintaining the plasma redox balance in vivo but is dispensable in mammalian development, although it is vitally important to cells in vitro.

Transport of amino acids across plasma membrane is mediated by several transport systems in mammalian cells (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). We have described a Na+-independent, cystine/glutamate exchange transport system, designated as system x–c, in various cultured cells like human fibroblasts and mouse peritoneal macrophages (2Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2372-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Watanabe H. Bannai S. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cells expressing system x–c take up cystine in the medium into the cell, and reduce it to cysteine (thiol form), which is in turn used for the synthesis of GSH and proteins. A part of cysteine is released back into the medium via neutral amino acid transport systems, and the cysteine is rapidly oxidized to cystine by oxygen in the medium. Thus, a series of these transports and redox reactions constitutes cystine/cysteine cycle across the plasma membrane. The activity of system x–c contributes to driving the cystine/cysteine cycle and to maintaining the redox balance between cystine and cysteine in the culture medium (6Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, the activity of system x–c is also demonstrated to be essential for maintaining the intracellular GSH levels (5Bannai S. Tateishi N. J. Membrane Biol. 1986; 89: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Because GSH plays a central role in alleviating oxidative stress, system x–c is regarded as a constituent of the antioxidant defense systems, at least in cultured cells. This transporter is composed of two protein components, xCT and the heavy chain of 4F2 antigen (6Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), and the transport activity is thought to be mediated by xCT. The activity of system x–c is induced by various stimuli, including electrophilic agents like diethyl maleate (7Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2435-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), oxygen (4Bannai S. Sato H. Ishii T. Sugita Y. J. Biol.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the induction of xCT by diethyl maleate is mediated by the electrophile response element located in the 5′-flanking region of the xCT gene and that the transcription factor Nrf2 binds to this element to activate the transcription of the xCT gene (11Sasaki H. Sato H. Kuriyama-Matsumura K. Sato K. Maebara K. Wang H. Tamba M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Bannai S. J. Biol.

We have recently demonstrated that the induction of xCT by amino acid deprivation is mediated by two amino acid response elements located in the 5′-flanking region of the xCT gene and suggested that the transcription factor ATF4 is involved in the inducible transcription of the xCT gene (10Sato H.

To clarify the physiological role of system x–c in vivo, we generated a mouse model deficient in xCT. In the present study, we describe the generation and initial characterization of the mice unable to express xCT. Materials—l-[14C]Cystine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monobromobimane was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals and agents were purchased from Sigma or Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd (Tokyo, Japan). Generation of xCT-null Mice—Genomic clones containing the mouse xCT gene were isolated from a 129/Sv genomic phage library (Stratagene). A 2.3-kb genomic fragment containing the translation initiation site and its 5′-flanking region was cut out with HindIII and NcoI, blunted with S1 nuclease, and inserted into modified pSVβ containing the GFP coding sequence. The fragment accompanying the GFP sequence was cut out and inserted into pLOXNATA, which contains neomycin resistance (neor) and thymidine kinase for selection of homologous recombination. Another 3.9-kb genomic fragment containing parts of exon 1 and intron 1 was cut out with NcoI and BamHI, blunted with Klenow fragment, and subcloned into pLOXNATA (Fig. 1). The targeting vector was linearized and transfected into E14 ES cells by the electroporation. Cells were cultured on growth-arrested neor embryonic fibroblasts under the G418 selection. Resistant colonies were picked on days 8 – 10, dissociated with trypsin, and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was plated on a 96-well plate, and genomic DNA was isolated from another aliquot and screened by PCR. Through PCR analysis of ∼1,000 ES cell clones, we identified four clones that carried the homologous recombinant allele. These positive clones were expanded and genotyped by Southern blot analysis. The positive ES clone was injected into C57BL/6 blastcysts and chimeric mice were generated. Male chimeric mice were bred with C57BL/6 female mice. Germ line transmission of the targeted allele was determined by the presence of agouti mice in the offspring. Mice were genotyped by isolating DNA from tail biopsies and analyzed by Southern blotting using the probes shown in Fig. 1. To remove the neor cassette in the allele of the mice, we bred these mice with Cre recombinase-expressing mice (C57BL/6). Offspring heterozygous for the neor cassette deleted allele were interbred, and mice homozygous for the mutation were identified by PCR and Southern blot analysis. All mice were 129/Svj-C57BL/6 mixed background littermates from F1 heterozygote crosses. All experiments were performed in 8 – 12-week-old homozygous (xCT–/–), heterozygous (xCT+/–), and wild-type (xCT+/+) littermates. This study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Tsukuba. Cell Culture and Cystine Uptake—Peritoneal macrophages elicited by 4% thioglycollate medium were collected and cultured as described previously (12Sato H. Kuriyama-Matsumura K. Hashimoto T. Sasaki H. Wang H. Ishii T. Mann G. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10407-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from day 14 embryos and cultured in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium supplemented with Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-G supplement (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air in the presence or absence of 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME). For subsequent experiments, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with and without 2ME. Cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/35-mm diameter dish, cultured for 24 h, and the activity of cystine transport was measured as described previously (2Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2372-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed three times in warmed (10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl), pH 7.4, containing 0.01% CaCl2, 0.01% MgCl2·6H2O and 0.1% glucose), and then incubated in 0.5 ml of the warmed uptake medium at 37 °C for specified time periods. The uptake medium was PBSG containing l-[14C]cystine (0.05 mm and 0.1 μCi/0.5 ml). Uptake was terminated by rapidly rinsing cells three times with ice-cold PBS, and radioactivity in cells was determined. Cystine uptake was determined under conditions approaching initial rates of uptake, i.e. measuring uptake for cystine at 2 min. The uptake of cystine increased linearly during this incubation. Measurement of Intracellular Cysteine and GSH—The cysteine and GSH contents in cells were determined by the method of Cotgreave and Moldéus (13Cotgreave I.A. Moldéus P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 13: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) with a slight modification (14Sagara J. Miura K. Bannai S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cells were rapidly rinsed three times with ice-cold 20 mm HEPES-saline (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl), pH 7.4, containing 0.01% CaCl2, 0.01% MgCl2·6H2O and 0.1% glucose, and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10 min with 100 μl of 8 mm monobromobimane in 50 mm N-ethylmorpholine (pH 8) and 100 μl of 50 mm HEPES-saline, containing 0.01% CaCl2, 0.01% MgCl2·6H2O, and 0.1% glucose. Then 10 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid were added. The protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and bimane adducts of cysteine and GSH in the supernatant were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC separation was achieved on a steel column (4.6 × 100 mm) packed with 3-μm octadodecylsilica reversed phase material. The fluorescence at 480 nm was monitored with the excitation at 394 nm. The elution was performed with 9% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.25% (v/v) acetic acid, pH 3.7 for 8 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min throughout the process. GSH in tissues was measured by the enzymatic method described previously (15Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar), which is based on the catalytic action of GSH in the reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) by the GSH reductase system. The GSH extracted from the tissues was mostly reduced GSH, and the content of the oxidized form, GSSG, was negligible. Northern Blot Analysis—The RNA probe for mouse xCT was digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled by transcription from the linearized plasmid using RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) and T3/T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene). RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred onto positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science), and hybridized with the DIG-labeled RNA probes in DIG Easy Hyb (Roche Applied Science) for 16 h at 68 °C. The membranes were washed twice for 5 min at room temperature with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and then washed twice for 15 min at 68 °C with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. The hybridized bands were visualized using CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science). Measurement of Amino Acid Concentrations in Plasma—Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and blood was directly collected from the heart. Collected blood was immediately centrifuged, and 100 μlof plasma was moved into the tube containing 10 μl of 50% sulfosalicylic acid and 10 nmol of norleucine as an internal standard. After 30 min in an ice bath, the mixture was frozen and stored until the assay. The frozen sample was thawed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant solution was removed, its pH was adjusted to 2.0 with 1 m LiOH, and 50 μl of the solution was assayed by the amino acid analyzer (JLC-300, JEOL Ltd, Japan). In this analysis, cysteine was eluted coincidently with α-aminoadipate and could not be determined. Measurement of Cysteine, GSH, and the Non-protein-bound Disulfide Forms of Cysteine and Those of GSH in Plasma—To determine cysteine and GSH concentrations, 100 μl of the plasma was immediately mixed with 100 μl of 8 mm monobromobimane in 50 mm N-ethylmorpholine, pH 8, and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. Then 10 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid was added. The protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and 20 μlofthe supernatant was measured by HPLC as described above. Concentrations of the total non-protein-bound disulfide forms of cysteine (CySST) and those of GSH (GSST) were determined as described previously (16Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.M. Ueland P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma was treated with N-ethyl maleimide to block free thiol compounds and then deproteinized by adding sulfosalicylic acid. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation and NaBH4 was added to the supernatant to reduce disulfide compounds. The excess N-ethyl maleimide is inactivated by NaBH4. The thiols formed were derivatized with monobromobimane and the bimane adducts of cysteine and GSH were analyzed by HPLC. CySST is equal to cystine + CySSX, where CySSX is the mixed disulfide of cysteine and the other thiols, and GSST is equal to GSSG + GSSY, where GSSY is the mixed disulfide of GSH and the other thiols. Cysteinylglycine and homocysteine may be included as a moiety in the mixed disulfides. However, the bimane adducts of cysteinylglycine and homocysteine were very small in quantity in HPLC analysis, and therefore, most of CySSX and GSSY was presumed to be CySSG. Generation of xCT-null Mice—Mice heterozygous for targeted disruption of the xCT gene were obtained by crossing the chimeric males with wild-type female mice and agouti offspring were screened for the presence of the mutated xCT gene by PCR. Offspring heterozygous for the mutation were interbred, and mice homozygous for the xCT-disrupted allele were identified by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2A). In the macrophages derived from these mice, however, aberrant mRNA for xCT was transcribed and the significant activity of system x–c was detected, although the induction of the activity of system x–c by LPS was significantly decreased (Fig. 2, B and C). Primer extension and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA end experiments demonstrated that the aberrant transcripts seemed to be initiated in the neor cassette, which was inserted in the opposite orientation between the xCT genomic sequences (data not shown). We bred these mice with Cre recombinase-expressing mice to remove the neor cassette (Fig. 1D). Offspring heterozygous for the neor cassette-deleted allele were interbred, and mice homozygous for the mutation were identified by PCR and Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3A). In these homozygous mice (–/– in Fig. 3), the expression of mRNA for xCT was completely abolished in brain and thymus where xCT mRNA is constitutively expressed in the wild-type mice (Fig. 3B). In the peritoneal macrophages derived from these mice, no xCT mRNA was detected (Fig. 3C). Activity of cystine transport was slightly detected, but the activity was not inhibited by glutamate and was not induced by LPS, indicating that no activity of cystine transport via system x–c is expressed in these cells (Fig. 3D). These data confirmed that the homozygous mice are xCT-null mutants. Analysis of xCT-null Mice—These xCT–/– mice developed normally and both males and females were fertile. They were healthy in appearance at the age of 6 months. The average litter size of homozygous B6;129 mixed background mutants were 8.2 ± 2.3 (mean ± S.D., n = 10). The percentage of the 8-week-old xCT–/– progeny from xCT+/– parents with mixed B6;129 background was 23% (n = 81), indicating that neither perinor postnatal death rates in the mutants were abnormal. Microscopically no abnormalities were found in any of the organs, including brain, lung, liver, heart, spleen, pancreas, thymus, intestine, adrenal glands, thyroid glands, skeletal muscle, esophagus, stomach, kidney, urinary bladder, uterus, ovary, and testis of mutants and their controls at the age of 8 weeks (data not shown). In hematological investigations, no abnormalities were found in these mice (data not shown). Analysis of plasma amino acids from littermate xCT+/+, xCT+/–, and xCT–/– mice revealed that the xCT–/– homozygotes contained approximately double the concentration of cystine in their plasma relative to the wild-type mice (Fig. 4). Plasma amino acid concentrations other than cystine showed no significant differences. Cysteine concentration was similar in the plasma of xCT+/+, xCT+/–, and xCT–/– mice, whereas the xCT–/– homozygotes contained approximately half the concentration of GSH of the wild-type mice (Fig. 5). Concentration of the total non-protein-bound disulfide forms of cysteine (CySST, i.e. cystine + CySSX) in plasma was much higher in xCT–/– mice than in xCT+/+ mice. Considering the cystine concentration shown in Fig. 4, the major part of CySST is thought to be cystine. GSST (GSSG + GSSY) was slightly higher in xCT–/– mice but the sum of GSST and GSH was nearly equal in xCT+/+, xCT+/–, and xCT–/– mice. The results suggest that the plasma of xCT–/– mice is in more oxidized state than that of wild-type mice. We have measured the GSH contents in the liver, kidney, cerebrum, cerebellum, thymus, and spleen of xCT+/+ and xCT–/– mice at the age of 8 – 12 weeks old, and could not find any significant differences between the two groups (data not shown).FIGURE 5Concentrations of cysteine, GSH, CySST, and GSST in the plasma of the xCT–/–, xCT–/–, and xCT–/– mice. Plasma of littermate xCT+/+ (open bar), xCT+/– (hatched bar), and xCT–/– (solid bar) mice at the age of 8 –10 weeks old were isolated, and concentrations of cysteine, GSH, CySST (cystine + CySSX), and GSST (GSSG + GSSY) were measured. Concentrations of CySST and GSST are expressed as cysteine equivalent and GSH equivalent, respectively. Data represent the means ± S.D.

Cells derived from xCT–/– mice did not proliferate and mostly died under the routine culture conditions, whereas cells derived from xCT+/+ and xCT+/– mice well proliferated. However, when xCT–/– cells were cultured in the presence of with 50 μm 2ME, cells proliferated normally (Fig. 6). In these embryonic fibroblasts, the activity of cystine transport of the xCT–/– cells was very low, compared with that of the xCT+/+ and xCT+/– cells (Fig. 7A), and the activity showed Na+ dependence and was not inhibited by glutamate (data not shown), indicating that the slight transport of cystine in the xCT–/– cells was not mediated by system x–c. In these cells, the intracellular cysteine and GSH were measured in the presence or absence of 2ME. Both intracellular cysteine and GSH of xCT–/– cells were drastically decreased within 8 h in the absence of 2ME (Fig. 7, B and C).FIGURE 7The activity of cystine uptake (A), and intracellular cysteine (B) and GSH (C) in embryonic fibroblasts derived from the xCT+/+, xCT+/–, and xCT–/– mice. A, xCT+/+ and xCT+/– cells were cultured in the absence of 50 μm 2ME, and xCT–/– cells were cultured in the presence of 50 μm 2ME. Then, rate of uptake of [14C]cystine was measured. Data represent the means ± S.D. (n = 4). B and C, xCT+/+ and xCT+/– cells were cultured in the absence of 50 μm 2ME, and xCT–/– cells were cultured in the presence of 50 μm 2ME. Then, cells were cultured in themediumwith (•) or without (○) 50 μm 2ME, and the cell extract was prepared at the time point indicated. The concentrations of intracellular cysteine and GSH were measured. Data represent the means ± S.D. (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cell proliferation was examined in the presence of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or vitamin E. As shown in Fig. 8, NAC caused the proliferation of the xCT–/– cells cultured in the routine culture condition without 2ME. However, the effective concentration of NAC for maintaining the cell growth was more than 1 mm, which was much higher than that of 2ME. On the other hand, vitamin E protected xCT–/– cells from the death induced by the withdrawal of 2ME, although cells did not proliferate. In the present study, we describe the generation of a null mutation of the xCT gene by homologous recombination in the mouse. The mutation results in the redox imbalance in plasma of the mice, i.e. a significant oxidative shift of the plasma cystine/cysteine redox balance and the decrease in the plasma concentration of GSH, compared with those of the wild-type mice. As Jones et al. (17Jones D.P. Mody Jr., V.C. Carlson J.L. Lynn M.J. Sternberg Jr., P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1290-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) have described, the redox potential value (Eh) for the cystine/cysteine couple (cystine + 2H+ + 2e– ⇆ 2 cysteine) is calculated using the Nernst equation shown in Equation 1, Eh=E0+RT/nF×ln[cystine]/[cysteine]2(Eq. 1) where E0 (in mV) is the standard potential for the redox couple, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred, and F is Faraday's constant. E0 value for the cystine/cysteine couple (pH 7.4) is –250 mV (18Jones D.P. Carlson J.L. Mody Jr, V.C. Cai J. Lynn M.J. Sternberg Jr., P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Eh values are equivalent to REDST values ([acid soluble thiol]2/[cystine]) defined by Hildebrandt et al. (19Hildebrandt W. Alexander S. Bartsch P. Dröge W. Blood. 2002; 99: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the plasma concentrations of free cystine and cysteine are 33 μm and 18.4 μm on average, respectively, in the xCT+/+ mice. The Eh value in these mice is approximately –100 mV. On the other hand, in the xCT–/– mice, the concentrations of free cystine and cysteine are 82 μm and 18.6 μm on average, respectively, and Eh value is approximately –89 mV. The oxidation change between the xCT+/+ and xCT–/– mice is 11 mV. Jones et al. (17Jones D.P. Mody Jr., V.C. Carlson J.L. Lynn M.J. Sternberg Jr., P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1290-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), showed that the Eh value for cystine/cysteine redox balance in the human subjects at the age of around 20 years old is approximately –80 mV and a linear oxidation of cystine/cysteine redox balance occurs with age at a rate of 0.16 mV/year over the entire age span (17Jones D.P. Mody Jr., V.C. Carlson J.L. Lynn M.J. Sternberg Jr., P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1290-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The oxidative shift of Eh value in the xCT–/– mice may imply that the aging is accelerated in these mice. Of particularly interest is the prominent increase in plasma cystine in elderly subjects with a little change in plasma cysteine (17Jones D.P. Mody Jr., V.C. Carlson J.L. Lynn M.J. Sternberg Jr., P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1290-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the similar results are observed between the xCT+/+ and xCT–/– mice at the ages of 8 –10-weeks old, i.e. significantly higher plasma cystine with remaining unchanged in the plasma cysteine in the xCT–/– mice, compared with the xCT+/+ mice. It is thought that the plasma concentrations of cystine and cysteine are largely determined by several mechanisms, including the interaction of cysteine from dietary proteins or endogenous protein catabolism with oxidized form of albumin and with the intracellular GSSG pool of erythrocytes, and the membrane transport activities and clearance rates of cystine and cysteine (20Hildebrandt W. Kinscherf R. Hauer K. Holm E. Dröge W. Mech. Age. Dev. 2002; 123: 1269-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Especially, the activity of the reabsorption system of cystine expressed in the proximal tubule of the kidney is an important factor for regulating the plasma cystine and cysteine concentrations (21Bannai S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 289-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In the plasma of patients with end stage renal failure, significant elevation of cystine is observed before dialysis (22Wilcken D.E.L. Gupta V.J. Reddy S.D. Clin. Sci. 1980; 58: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Wlodek P.J. Iciek M.B. Milkowski A. Smolenski O.B Clin. Chim. Acta. 2001; 304: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the reabsorption system of cystine expressed in the kidney, which is mediated by amino acid transport system b0,+, probably plays a pivotal role for maintaining the plasma cystine/cysteine redox balance. However, the results presented here suggest that xCT also functions as a system for the clearance of cystine in plasma. xCT mRNA is constitutively expressed in some specific regions of the brain (24Sato H. Tamba M. Okuno S. Sato K. Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Bannai S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8028-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in thymus (Fig. 3B) and in spleen. 3H. Sato, K. Taguchi, M. Tamba, and S. Bannai, unpublished data. These organs may take part in the clearance of cystine in plasma. Because xCT–/– mice develop normally, system b0,+ may compensate at least in part the function of system xc– in xCT–/– mice. In GSH contents in tissues so far determined, there was no difference between xCT+/+ and xCT–/– mice. Presumably, it is due to unchanged plasma cysteine concentration. On the other hand, the plasma GSH level is significantly decreased in xCT–/– mice. It may be that cystine at the relatively high concentration in plasma of these mice reacts with GSH to form cysteine/GSH mixed disulfide (CySSG), resulting in the decreased GSH. This view is supported by the data shown in Fig. 5 where the decrease of GSH in xCT–/– mice was compensated by the increase of GSST. No significant difference in the sum of the plasma concentrations of GSH and GSST may exclude a possibility that xCT–/– mice have a defect in hepatic GSH export. The fibroblasts from the embryo of the xCT–/– mice could not survive under the routine culture conditions, but they grew normally in the presence of 2ME (Fig. 6). As described previously (25Ishii T. Bannai S. Sugita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12387-12392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2ME reacts with cystine in the medium and produces a mixed disulfide of 2ME and cysteine, which is taken up by cells through neutral amino acid transporters. The mixed disulfide in cells is rapidly reduced to cysteine and 2ME, and the latter is released out of cells and reacts with cystine again. In this way, cysteine is supplied and cells can survive and grow. Because 2ME functions catalytically, 50 μm 2ME is enough to provide cysteine. On the other hand, relatively high concentration of NAC is required for maintaining the proliferation of cells derived from xCT–/– mice (Fig. 8). NAC is thought to be transported into the cell directly and is converted to cysteine. Compared with cells cultured with 2ME or NAC, cells cultured with vitamin E did not grow although they survived (Fig. 8). GSH in these cells was almost undetectable (data not shown). In this case, cysteine is not supplied from the medium, and cells cease to grow because of the inhibition of net protein synthesis. The results suggest that cells from xCT–/– mice under the routine culture conditions die because of oxidant stress, which is alleviated by an antioxidant such as GSH or vitamin E. xCT is a highly inducible protein, i.e. it is induced by electrophilic agents (7Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2435-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), oxygen (4Bannai S. Sato H. Ishii T. Sugita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18480-18484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and some stimuli like LPS and TNF-α (9Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The xCT–/– mice may be more sensitive to oxidative stress. It is worth investigating the response of these mice to these stresses in vivo. The oxidative shift of the plasma cystine/cysteine redox balance was observed not only in association with increased age (17Jones D.P. Mody Jr., V.C. Carlson J.L. Lynn M.J. Sternberg Jr., P.

Med. 2003; 35: 1582-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Various signal cascades have been found in response to moderate changes in the redox state (29Dröge W. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 82: 47-95Crossref Scopus (7605) Google Scholar). The plasma cystine/cysteine redox balance is significantly oxidized in the xCT–/– mice even at the age of 8–10 weeks old. It is likely that some signal cascades are modulated in these mice. The xCT–/– mice may be useful for investigating senescence and diseases related to oxidative stress. We thank Drs. M. Masu, K.

This transition yields a new type of localized state2,3,4,5 with particle–wave duality: surface capillary waves emanate from a bouncing drop, which self-propels by interaction with its own wave and becomes a walker. When two walkers come close, they interact through their waves and this ‘collision’ may cause the two walkers to orbit around each other6,7,8."

In the present study, we analyzed ligand/receptor interactions and receptor-proximal events leading to TLR3 activation. The mutagenesis approach showed that certain cysteine residues and glycosylation in TLR3 amino-terminal leucine-rich repeats were necessary for ligand-induced signaling. Furthermore, inactive mutants had a dominant negative effect, suggesting that the signaling module is a multimer. We constructed a chimeric molecule fusing the amino-terminal ectodomain of TLR3 to the transmembrane and carboxyl terminal domains of CD32a containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based motif.

The synthetic double-stranded RNAs poly(I-C) and poly(A-U) induced calcium mobilization in a TLR3-CD32 stably transfected U937 clone but not in control cells transfected with other constructs. An anti-TLR3 antibody also induced Ca2+ flux but only when cross-linked by a secondary anti-immunoglobulin antibody, confirming that multimerization by the ligand is a requirement for signaling. The inhibitors of lysosome maturation, bafilomycin and chloroquine, inhibited the poly(I-C)-induced biological response in immune cells, showing that TLR3 interacted with its ligand in acidic subcellular compartments. Furthermore, TLR3-CD32 activation with poly(I-C) was only observed within a narrow pH window (pH 5.7–6.7), whereas anti-TLR3-mediated Ca2+ flux was pH-insensitive. The importance of an acidic pH for TLR3-ligand interaction becomes critical when using oligomeric poly(I-C) (15–40-mers). These observations demonstrate that engagement of TLR3 by poly(I-C) at an acidic pH, probably in early phagolysosomes or endosomes, induces receptor aggregation leading to signaling.

Mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; DC, dendritic cell(s); HEK, human embryonic kidney; IL, interleukin; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based motif; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; MonoDC, monocyte-derived DC(s); PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell(s); TRIF, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter protein; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA. belong to a family of receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. TLRs play a key role in host defense during pathogen infection by regulating and linking the innate and adaptive immune responses (1.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 2.Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 3.Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4751) Google Scholar). TLRs are expressed in dendritic cells (DC), sentinels of the immune system, endowing them with the capacity to sense pathogen-derived products and to alert the immune system (4.Kaisho T. Akira S. Curr. Mol. Med. 2003; 3: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Members of the TLR family are also variably expressed on nonhematopoietic cells. TLR-deficient mice and transfected cell lines have been the keys to understanding TLR function. Ligand specificity has been elucidated for most TLRs; thus, TLR2 and TLR4 recognize Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial cell wall products, respectively. TLR5 recognizes a structural epitope of bacterial flagellin, and TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 have been demonstrated to recognize different forms of microbial-derived nucleic acid (5.Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Host-derived ligands for the TLRs have also been identified; in particular, TLR4 recognizes heat shock proteins and pulmonary surfactant (6.Beg A.A. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 509-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), and TLR9 recognizes chromatin-IgG complexes (7.Leadbetter E.A. Rifkin I.R. Hohlbaum A.M. Beaudette B.C. Shlomchik M.J. Marshak-Rothstein A. Nature. 2002; 416: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). TLR3 has been extensively characterized to be a receptor for poly(I-C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) mimic (8.Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar); recently, it has been shown to mediate responses to West Nile virus (9.Wang T. Town T. Alexopoulou L. Anderson J.F. Fikrig E. Flavell R.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1366-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) as well as dsRNA derived from the helminth parasite Schistosoma (10.Aksoy E. Zouain C.S. Vanhoutte F. Fontaine J. Pavelka N. Thieblemont N. Willems F. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Goldman M. Capron M. Ryffel B. Trottein F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Additionally, host-derived mRNA has recently been shown to activate TLR3, suggesting that activation via TLR3 can occur in a variety of situations (11.Kariko K. Ni H. Capodici J. Lamphier M. Weissman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12542-12550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Whereas most TLRs recruit myeloid differentiation factor 88 (12.O'Neill L.A. Fitzgerald K.A. Bowie A.G. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), with some variation in the signaling profile mediated by the additional recruitment of Toll/interleukin-1 receptor-containing adapter protein and TRIF-related adaptor molecule, TLR3 recruits only TRIF (13.Yamamoto M.

Endotoxin Res. 2004; 10: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TRIF can activate both NF-κB through TRAF6 and receptor-interacting protein-1 (16.Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar) and interferon-regulatory factor 3 through IκB kinase/TANK-binding kinase 1 (17.Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (18.Sarkar S.N. Peters K.L. Elco C.P. Sakamoto S. Pal S. Sen G.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1060-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although the signaling pathway of TLRs is increasingly well characterized, the parameters controlling interactions between the receptors and the ligands remain poorly documented. A recent review (19.Mukhopadhyay S. Herre J. Brown G.D. Gordon S. Immunology. 2004; 112: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) summarized the role of individual members of the TLR family or other surface antigens that either physically or functionally interact with TLRs and how the cumulative effects of these interactions instruct the nature and outcome of the immune response to a particular pathogen. For example, TLR2 recognizes specific ligands upon association with TLR1 or TLR6, and this heterodimerization is essential for signaling (20.Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 21.Sandor F. Latz E. Re F. Mandell L. Repik G. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. Kurt-Jones E.A. Finberg R.W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Equally, in most signaling assays involving recombinant CD4-TLR fusions, the CD4 moiety induces dimerization in order to produce constitutive signaling (22.Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4439) Google Scholar). Whereas TLR2 and TLR4 are expressed at the cell surface, TLR7, -8, and -9 traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes (23.Ahmad-Nejad P. Hacker H. Rutz M. Bauer S. Vabulas R.M. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 24.Heil F. Ahmad-Nejad P. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Gellert T. Dietrich H. Lipford G. Takeda K. Akira S.

Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The recognition of CpG-containing DNA by TLR9 has been shown to occur in lysosomes (26.Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar), and optimal interaction was observed at an acidic pH (27.Rutz M. Metzger J. Gellert T. Luppa P. Lipford G.B. Wagner H. Bauer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In addition, recognition of single-stranded RNA by TLR7 has been reported to require an acidic compartment (25.Lee J. Chuang T.H. Redecke V. She L. Pitha P.M. Carson D.A. Raz E. Cottam H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 28.Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Akira S. Reis e Sousa C. Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar). In the case of TLR3, which is expressed on myeloid DC as well as on nonhematopoietic cells (29.Matsumoto M. Seya T. Uirusu. 2001; 51: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), cell surface expression has been described in both fibroblast and epithelial cells (30.Matsumoto M. Kikkawa S. Kohase M. Miyake K. Seya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), whereas it is reported to be expressed in an intracellular compartment in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (31.Matsumoto M. Funami K. Tanabe M. Oshiumi H. Shingai M. Seto Y. Yamamoto A. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3154-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Thus, to date, the exact subcellular compartment in which the interaction between TLR3 and its ligand occurs remains unknown. The construction of chimeric molecules involving different TLRs or between TLR and other molecules (e.g. CD4) has been used mainly to decipher TLR signaling pathways (22.Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4439) Google Scholar, 32.Hasan U.A. Dollet S. Vlach J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33.Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We thus decided to develop novel chimeric molecules to study interactions between TLR3 and its ligands. We constructed a recombinant molecule fusing the extracellular amino-terminal of TLR3 and the transmembrane and intracellular carboxyl terminus of CD32a. CD32a is a transmembrane molecule displaying an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) allowing recruitment of a cytosolic kinase complex, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase and phospholipase Cγ, leading to calcium mobilization from intracellular stores (34.Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Calcium flux assays are immediate, simple to perform, and highly sensitive and do not have the classical toxicity problems of molecules or solvent often found in reporter assays. The TLR3-CD32 construction was expressed in the myeloid cell line U937. We observed cell surface expression of the chimera and calcium mobilization upon TLR3 aggregation. Using this model as well as mutants that produced a dominant negative effect, we demonstrate that poly(I-C) mediates TLR3 cross-linking, and we observe a critical role of acidic pH in mediating this activation. Furthermore, we show that physiologically, in ex vivo immune cells, the TLR3/ligand interaction is dependent on the acidification of a subcellular compartment. Isolation of Immune Cells and Cell Culture—Human blood samples were obtained according to institutional guidelines. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation. For monocyte-derived DC (MonoDC) generation, monocytes were further purified as low density cells on a 52% Percoll gradient and plated for adherence. Nonadherent cells were removed, and complete RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 200 ng/ml recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL-4 (Schering-Plough Research Institute, Kenilworth, NJ) was added for 5–6 days (35.Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4504) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml gentamicin (Schering-Plough, Levallois-Perret, France). HEK293T and HEK293 cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Activation of PBMC and DC and Detection of Cytokine Secretion—Freshly isolated PBMC and MonoDC were plated at a concentration of 106 cells/ml and 5 × 105 cells/ml, respectively, and activated with different TLR ligands for 18 h. The following activating factors were used at final concentrations of 10 μg/ml poly(I-C) (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA), 10 μg/ml poly(A-U) (Sigma), 5 μg/ml CpG D19 (synthesized by MWG (Courtaboeuf, France)), 1 or 10 μm R-848 (imidazoquinoline, resiquimod synthesized in our laboratory; Schering-Plough), and 1 μg/ml or 10 ng/ml Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (Sigma) for PBMC and MonoDC, respectively. Chloroquine and bafilomycin (Sigma) were added 45 min prior to the addition of activators. After 18 h, supernatants were collected and tested for IP-10/CXCL10 and IL-6 secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD OptiEIA; BD Biosciences). Results are expressed as a mean of triplicates, and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 3 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Generation and Use of Small Poly(I-C) Fragments—Poly(I) (15-, 30-, and 40-mers) and poly(C) (15-, 30-, and 40-mers) (purchased from Ambion (Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, UK) and Invitrogen) were mixed in equal proportions according to their size for 15 min at 95 °C. Independently, fragmentation of high molecular weight poly(I-C) was performed by metal-induced hydrolysis as recommended by Affymetrix (Affymetrix protocols for eukaryotic target preparation; Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK). Briefly, 200 μg of poly(I-C) was incubated with 40 μlof5× RNA fragmentation buffer (200 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 500 mm KOAc, 150 mm MgOAc) (Sigma) in a final volume of 200 μl, for 35 min at 90 °C. Fragmented poly(I-C) was then allowed to reach room temperature before purification. The relative sizes of dsRNA fragments were examined on a 2% agarose gel (NuSieveR 3:1; Bio-Whittaker Molecular Applications, Walkersville, ME). Mutagenesis of Human TLR3—Full-length human TLR3 was subcloned from the TLR3-pUNO plasmid (InvivoGen) into pMET7 (a gift of the DNAX Institute, Schering-Plough Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA), and TLR3-pMET7 was then used for mutagenesis. Generation of the TLR3 mutants was performed using site-directed mutagenesis of residues in the luminal domain of human TLR3. Mutations were inserted using the GeneEditor kit (Invitrogen) using oligonucleotides summarized below. Pairs of oligonucleotides were as follows: C95A, forward (5′-ACTGGAGCCAGAATTCGCCCAGAAACTTCCC-3′) and reverse (5′-AATTCTGGCTCCAGTTTTGAGATGG-3′); C122A, forward (5′-GATAAAACCTTTGCCTTCGCGACGAATTTGA-3′ and reverse (5′-GAAGGCAAAGGTTTTATCAGAAAGTTG-3′); C226A, forward (5′-GAGTTTTCTCCAGGGGCCCTTCACGCAATTGG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCCTGGAGAAAACTCTTTAATTTGATTCG-3′); C242A, forward (5′-GCCTTACAGAGAAGCTTGCGTTGGAATTAGC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGCTTCTCTGTAAGGCTGGGACCCAGCTGG-3′); N196G, forward (5′-GAACTGGATATCTTTGCCGGCTCATCTTT-3′) and reverse (5′-GGCAAAGATATCCAGTTCTTCTTCACTTTTTAGC-3′); N247R, forward (5′-GAAGCTATGTTTGGAATTAGCCGGCACAAGCATTC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTAATTCCAAACATAGCTTCTCTGTAAGGC-3′). The inserted restriction site used to identify the mutation is underlined. After mutagenesis, the mutants were entirely sequenced, and no other mutations were detected. Double mutants (CC1A and NN3A) were created by a second round of mutagenesis on selected plasmids. Transient Expression in HEK293T and U937—HEK293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates to give 50–70% confluence on the day of transfection. Cells were transfected with TLR3-pMET7 by incubating 3 μl of Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) with 1 μg of plasmid in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 for 30 min. The mixture was divided to give a final transfection amount of 250 ng/well. After an 18-h incubation, cells were recovered and harvested for fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. U937 cells were nucleofected using the Nucleofector™ technology (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) with the program T14 and the nucleofector solution V, as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 6–8 × 106 cells were washed in PBS and resuspended extemporaneously in 100 μl of supplemented solution V at room temperature, and 6 μg of plasmid was added to the cell suspension and transferred in an appropriate cuvette for nucleoporation impulsion. After 18 h, cells were harvested for assays. NF-κB Reporter Assay—Tissue culture plates (6-well) with HEK293 or HEK293T cells were transiently transfected using Fugene 6 as described above, with 500 ng of NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid (Invitrogen) together with constant and increasing amounts of the wild type and mutant TLR3 expression vectors, respectively. Controls to test reporter activity of wild type and mutant TLR3 constructions were also tested in HEK293T cells. Cells were transiently transfected with 500 ng of NF-κB luciferase plasmid together with 250 ng of wild type or mutant TLR3 pMET7 vectors. In all transfections, the total DNA amounts were kept constant using empty vector (pMET7). Six hours post-transfection, cells from each transfection were divided into 96-well plates. The following day, cells were stimulated with poly(I-C) at 5 μg/ml for 6 h and analyzed for luciferase activity. Luciferase Assay—Cells were analyzed for firefly luciferase activity using Promega Steady-Glo reporter assay reagents as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Charbonnières, France). Luciferase units were measured using a Fusion α detection apparatus (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). Each experiment was performed in triplicate and was repeated three times; results generally deviated by less than 10% of the mean value. Western Blot of TLR3 Constructs—HEK293T cells were transiently transfected using Fugene 6 as described above. 48 h post-transfection, transfected HEK293T and nontransfected HEK293 cells were lysed in mild lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 20 mm NaF, and 0.3 mm ortho-sodium vanadate. In general, 30 μg of total cellular protein (determined by Bradford assay; Bio-Rad) was used for SDS-NuPAGE and immunoblotting (Invitrogen). After incubation with anti-TLR3 antibody (clone 40C1285; Imgenex, Sorrento Valley, CA), reactive proteins were detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories, Inc., Soham, Cambridgeshire, UK) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of the TLR3-CD32 Chimera and Cloning into the Expression Vector pMET7—The luminal domain of human TLR3 was amplified from the TLR3-pUNO plasmid using the primers TLR3-SalI forward (5′-ACGCGTCGACGATCATGAGACAGACTTTGCC-3′) and TLR3-AsnI reverse (5′-TAGCATTAATAGTTCAAAGGGGGCACTGTC-3′). The transmembrane and intracellular domains of CD32a were amplified from PBMC cDNA using the primers CD32-AsnI forward (5′-ATTAATGGGGATCATTGTGGC-3′) and CD32-NotI reverse (5′-TAATGCGGCCGCTGGCATAACGTTACTCTTTAG-3′). For the construction, an AsnI restriction site was created between the luminal domain of TLR3 and methionine 215 of CD32a (Fig. 2A), leading to the insertion of a leucine at base pair 2113 of TLR3. The chimeric construction was cloned into the SalI and NotI sites of the mammalian expression vector pMET7. Oligonucleotides designed for PCR amplification were derived from GenBank™ sequences NM003265 and M31932 for TLR3 and CD32a, respectively. PCR amplification was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 480 Thermal-Cyler. Stable Expression in U937 Cells—U937 cells were nucleofected with plasmids at a ratio of one copy of pcDNA3.1(+)Hygro (Invitrogen), which contains an hygromycin resistance gene expressed in mammalian cells as a selective marker, to 10 copies of TLR3-CD32/pMET7, following the procedure described above. 24 h later, Hygromycin B (50 mg/ml; Sigma) was added at 150 μg/ml. After a 4-week culture period of selection, cloning was performed in round bottom plates, at approximately 1 cell/well. Clones were screened by fluorescence-activated cell sorting staining with the goat anti-human TLR3 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—Cells (105/assay) were incubated with 2 μg of anti-TLR3 antibody (goat anti-human TLR3-specific IgG; R&D Systems) or a goat IgG1 control (Sigma). After washes, phytoerythrin-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody (Sigma) was added at a final dilution of 1:50. Before intracytoplasmic staining, permeabilization was performed using Cytofix/Cytoperm™ kit (BD Biosciences). Calcium Flux Assay—Cells (107/ml) were loaded with Indo I at 3 μg/ml (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), in RPMI plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 40 min at 37 °C, washed twice, and resuspended at 107 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution (0.44 mm potassium phosphate, 5.37 mm potassium chloride, 0.34 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 136.89 mm sodium chloride, 5.55 mm d-glucose), 10 mm Hepes. For assays, 106 cells were diluted in 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mm Hepes, supplemented with 1.6 mm CaCl2 (complete Hanks' balanced salt solution). Measurements were made in a temperature-controlled Deltascan spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ). Injections were performed when cells were completely stabilized in the cuvette at a volume of 20 μl. Results are expressed as a ratio of Indo I emission 405/485 nm (calcium-Indo I/free Indo I ratio). When not specified, the pH was kept at 6.6. Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer adjusted to different pH in a gradient from 5.5 to 7.5 was prepared in advance by the addition of either HCl or NaOH, and cells were suspended in the buffer immediately before the calcium flux assay. Cross-linking and Desensitization Conditions—Anti-CD32 (FcγRII) antibody (Stem Cell Technologies) was added at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml to the cells within the cuvette for 3–5 min. CD32 aggregation was effective by the addition of goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) F(ab′)2 fragment, (Immunotech, Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France) at 10 μg/ml final concentration. For cells transfected with TLR3-CD32 chimera, either 0.5 μg/ml goat anti-human TLR3-specific IgG (R&D Systems) was added prior to the cross-linking performed with the addition of biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at 1:100 final concentration or mouse anti-TLR3.7 antibody (eBiosciences) at 5 μg/ml final concentration for the first incubation, followed by the addition of 10 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) F(ab′)2 fragment (Immunotech; Beckman-Coulter). For experiments with the TLR2-CD32 chimera, cross-linking was performed with mouse anti-TLR2.1 (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) at 2.5 μg/ml followed by the goat anti-mouse IgG. Desensitization was performed as described above for cross-linking; briefly, a second injection was performed when the ratio 405/485 had retrieved the base line or 3 min after the latest injection, when no calcium flux had been induced. Cysteine Residues and Glycosylation of TLR3 Leucine-rich Repeats Are Necessary for Ligand-induced Signaling—We compared the sequences of the TLR3 leucine-rich repeats in humans, mice, and rats. We noted that the TLR3 molecules contain two conserved pairs of cysteines (Cys95 and Cys122; Cys226 and Cys242) in adjacent leucine-rich repeats. The recently published crystal structures of TLR3 suggest an intramolecular disulfide bridge between Cys95 and Cys122 but do not allow us to predict a function for Cys226 and Cys242 (36.Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A. Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 37.Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Equally, we identified two conserved potential N-glycosylation (NX(S/T)) sites (Asn196 and Asn247) that were of particular interest to us, since they were predicted to lie on the same side of the leucine-rich repeat solenoid as the cysteines. Site-specific substitution mutants of all of the four cysteines and these two N-glycosylation sites were produced (Fig. 1E). Wild type and mutant TLR3 molecules were transfected into TLR3-negative HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A) together with a reporter plasmid containing consensus NF-κB sites, which when activated directed the expression of firefly luciferase. The mutant TLR3 molecules were expressed to a similar extent as the native TLR3 molecule, as shown by Western blot using anti-TLR3 (Fig. 1, B and C). Although no difference can be seen in the expression of the cysteine mutants, the glycosylation site mutants show a size difference with respect to native TLR3. In fact, the double mutant (NN3A) shows a size compatible with a less glycosylated molecule. It can thus be supposed that these two sites represent important sites of N-linked glycosylation for human TLR3 in mammalian cell lines, such as HEK293 cells. A consistently lower level of expression was seen for the double glycosylation site mutant, suggesting that the molecule is subject to faster degradation than the other mutants. Mutants C95A, C122A, CC1A (C95A/C122A), N247R, and NN3A (N196G/N247R), in response to poly(I-C) at 25 μg/ml, did not induce luciferase expression (Fig. 1D), suggesting that they have lost most of their ligand recognition activity, whereas mutants N196G, C226A, and C242A did not show significant loss of activity. Loss of Function TLR3 Mutants Have a Dominant Negative Effect on TLR3 Signaling—Unlike the HEK293T cell line, HEK293 cells constitutively express TLR3 (Fig. 1A) and respond to poly(I-C). In addition, we performed experiments using TRIF small interfering RNA, which blocked NF-κB signaling when HEK293 cells were activated with poly(I-C), thereby demonstrating involvement of TLR3 (data not shown). We took advantage of this expression to measure the ability of the different mutants to block the activity of wild type endogenous TLR3. We observed a nearly complete abrogation of poly(I-C)-induced luciferase activity in cells transfected with all nonfunctional mutants (Fig. 2, A and B), establishing that the loss of function was not due to a"

Because of structural similarity between the β-lactam ring and the d-alanyl4-d-alanine5 extremity of bacterial cell wall precursors, the drugs act as suicide substrates of the dd-transpeptidases that catalyze the last cross-linking step of cell wall assembly. Here, we show that this mechanism of action can be defeated by a novel type of transpeptidase identified for the first time by reverse genetics in aβ-lactam-resistant mutant of Enterococcus faecium. The enzyme, Ldtfm, catalyzes in vitro the cross-linking of peptidoglycan subunits in a β-lactam-insensitive ld-transpeptidation reaction. The specificity of Ldtfm for the l-lysyl3-d-alanine4 peptide bond of tetrapeptide donors accounts for resistance because the substrate does not mimic β-lactams in contrast to d-alanyl4-d-alanine5 in the pentapeptide donors required for dd-transpeptidation. Ldtfm homologues are encountered sporadically among taxonomically distant bacteria, indicating that ld-transpeptidase-mediated resistance may emerge in various pathogens.

Ldtfm homologues are encountered sporadically among taxonomically distant bacteria, indicating that ld-transpeptidase-mediated resistance may emerge in various pathogens. More than 60 years after the introduction of penicillin, the class of β-lactam antibiotics remains the most commonly used to treat severe infections despite the emergence of various resistance mechanisms, including drug detoxification by production of β-lactamases (1.Jacoby G.A. Munoz-Price L.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), decreased affinity of the target (2.Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

The success story of β-lactams involves the development of several generations of β-lactams to defeat the resistance mechanisms and their association with inhibitors of β-lactamases (4.Walsh C.

Among the dd-transpeptidases of Enterococcus faecium, the low affinity PBP5 is unessential for growth but responsible for intrinsic low level resistance to ampicillin (8.Fontana R. Cerini R. Longoni P. Grossato A. Canepari P. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Williamson R. Le Bouguénec C. Gutmann L. Horaud T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 1933-1940PubMed Google Scholar), the first-line drug used at high dosage to treat severe enterococcal infections. In clinical isolates, higher levels of resistance to ampicillin are commonly associated with multiple amino acid substitutions in the transpeptidase domain of PBP5 (10.Klare I. Rodloff A.C. Wagner J. Witte W. Hakenbeck R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 783-78717Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11.Rice L.B. Bellais S. Carias L.L. Hutton-Thomas R. Bonomo R.A. Caspers P. Page M.G. Gutmann L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3028-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that even higher levels of resistance to ampicillin can be achieved by a novel mechanism in the absence of PBP5 (12.Mainardi J.L. Legrand R. Arthur M.

Analysis of the peptidoglycan of the in vitro selected β-lactam-resistant mutant E. faecium M512 revealed that the d-Ala4→d-iAsn-l-Lys3 cross-link had been replaced by a novel type of cross-link between the l-Lys3 carboxyl group of a donor and the side-chain d-iAsn of an acceptor (12.Mainardi J.L.

In the presence of ampicillin, the novel l-Lys3→d-iAsn-l-Lys3 cross-links were exclusively found in the peptidoglycan of E. faecium M512, indicating that the dd-transpeptidase activity of the PBPs did not participate in the formation of the cross-links. Selection of E. faecium M512 from E. faecium D344S in five consecutive steps on increasing concentrations of ampicillin led to the gradual activation of the ld-transpeptidation pathway because the proportion of l-Lys3→d-iAsn-l-Lys3 was 3.1% for D344S and increased at each selection step (13.Mainardi J.L. Morel V. Fourgeaud M. Cremniter J. Blanot D. Legrand R. Frehel C. Arthur M. van Heijenoort J. Gutmann L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35801-35807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Activation of the resistance pathway was associated with the production of a dd-carboxypeptidase that generated precursors containing a tetrapeptide stem in the cytoplasm of E. faecium M512 (13.Mainardi J.L. Morel V. Fourgeaud M. Cremniter J. Blanot D. Legrand R. Frehel C. Arthur M. van Heijenoort J. Gutmann L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35801-35807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we have speculated that precursors containing a tetrapeptide stem are essential for the formation of the l-Lys3→d-iAsn-l-Lys3 cross-links. In the present work, we have identified in E. faecium an ld-transpeptidase as the key enzyme of this alternate transpeptidation pathway and have shown that its substrate does not bear structural similarity to β-lactams. The bypass mechanism could invalidate the β-lactams as the major class of antibiotics. Purification of the ld-Transpeptidase and N-terminal Sequencing— The ld-transpeptidase from E. faecium (Ldtfm) was partially purified in four chromatographic steps using a radioactive exchange assay (13.Mainardi J.L.

Bacteria were disrupted with glass beads in a cell disintegrator (The Mickle Laboratory Engineering Co., Gromshall, UK) for 2 h at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged (5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Soluble proteins (1 g) were loaded onto an anion exchange column (Hi-Load™ 26/10 Q-Sepharose™ HP, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.86) (buffer A). Elution was performed with a linear 0–2 m NaCl gradient in buffer A. Active fractions were pooled (30 mg of proteins), concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon YM10, Millipore, Saint-Quentin-en-Yve-lines, France), and loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 HR26/60, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.3 m NaCl. Active fractions (1 mg of proteins) were loaded onto a weak anion exchange column (HiTrap™ DEAE fast flow™ 1 ml, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins (300 μg) eluting between 0.2 and 0.3 m NaCl were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon ultra-4, Millipore) and loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.3 m NaCl. Active fractions (70 μg of proteins) were concentrated (Amicon ultra-4) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealing a major 48-kDa protein band that was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Problott, Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) by passive adsorption (14.Messer M. Griffiths M. Rismiller P.D. Shaw D.C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1997; 118: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). N-terminal Edman sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Procise 494HT instrument with reagents and methods recommended by the manufacturer. The open reading frame for the ld-transpeptidase was identified by similarity searches between the N-terminal sequence of the 48-kDa protein (AEKQEIDPVSQNHQKLDTTV) and the partial genome sequence of E. faecium using the software tBLAST at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The partially purified 48-kDa protein corresponded to a proteolytic fragment because the sequence encoding its N terminus was not preceded by a translation initiation codon. The upstream sequence contained a single likely translation initiation site (ACTTAAggagTTGTCGATatg), consisting of an ATG codon preceded by a putative ribosome binding site (lowercase). Production of the ld-Transpeptidase in E. coli and Purification of the Protein—A portion of the ldtfm open reading frame of E. faecium M512 was amplified with the primers 5′-TTCCATGGCAGAAAAACAAGAAATAGATCC-3′ and 5′-TTGGATCCGAAGACCAATACAGGCG-3′. The PCR product digested with NcoI and BamHI (underlined) was cloned into pET2818, a derivative of pET2816 (15.Chastanet A. Fert J. Msadek T. Mol.

Isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and incubation was continued for 17 h at 16 °C. Ldtfm was purified from a clarified lysate by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose resin (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) followed by anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ HR5/5, Amersham Biosciences) with a NaCl gradient in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. An additional gel filtration was performed on a Superdex HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 300 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The overall yield was 3 mg/liter of culture. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the QuikChange procedure of Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Substrates of the ld-Transpeptidase—The dipeptide Nα,Nϵ-diacetyl-l-lysyl-d-alanine (Ac2-l-Lys-d-Ala) was prepared as described previously (13.Mainardi J.L. Morel V. Fourgeaud M. Cremniter J.

To assay for in vitro transpeptidation, the ld-transpeptidase (3 μg) was incubated with the monomeric muropeptides GlcNAc-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-iGln-l-(Nϵ-d-iAsn)Lys-d-Ala (25 nmol), GlcNAc-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-iGln-l-(Nϵ-d-iAsn)Lys (5 nmol), and GlcNAc-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-d-Ala (5 nmol) for 2 h at 37°C in 25 μl of 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The reaction was stopped by boiling the sample for 3 min, and the mixture was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 2 min). The formation of dimers was determined by mass spectrometry on a 10-μl aliquot. For tandem mass spectrometry analysis, the remainder of the reaction mixture was treated with ammonium hydroxide to cleave the ether link internal to MurNAc (21.Arbeloa A. Hugonnet J.E.

The conditions for fragmentation of the resulting lactoyl peptides with N2 as the collision gas were as described previously (21.Arbeloa A. Hugonnet J.E. Sentilhes A.C. Josseaume N. Dubost L.

Identification of the ld-Transpeptidase of E. faecium M512 (Ldtfm)— We identified the gene encoding the ld-transpeptidase for the formation of the l-Lys3→d-iAsn-l-Lys3 responsible cross-links in E. faecium M512 by partial purification of the enzyme (48 kDa), sequencing of its N terminus, and similarity searches in the partial genome sequence of E. faecium (Fig. 2, A and B). The partially purified protein was a proteolytic fragment lacking the 118 N-terminal residues, including a putative membrane anchor. The portion of the open frame encoding the proteolytic fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli for large scale protein purification (Fig. 2C). The protein was active in an exchange assay (Fig. 2D) and was not inhibited by ampicillin (Fig. 2E), indicating that the gene encoding the ld-transpeptidase of E. faecium M512 (Ldtfm) had been successfully identified. Specificity of Ldtfm—To gain insight into the activity of Ldtfm, various 2-amino and 2-hydroxy acids were tested as potential acceptor substrates in an exchange reaction using the model dipeptide substrate Ac2-l-Lys-d-Ala as the donor (Fig. 2F and TABLE ONE). Formation of depsipeptides with d-lactic, d-2-hydroxyhexanoic, and d-malic acids revealed that Ldtfm can catalyze formation of ester bonds in addition to peptide bonds. Acceptors containing a relatively bulky side chain such as d-Met and d-2-hydroxyhexanoic acid were used as acceptors in the transpeptidation and transesterification reactions. Hydrolysis of the C-terminal d-Ala of Ac2-l-Lys-d-Ala was not detected in the presence of a suitable acceptor substrate, indicating a biosynthetic function for Ldtfm, in contrast to the previously characterized ld-carboxypeptidase involved in peptidoglycan recycling in E. coli (23.Templin M.F. Ursinus A. Höltje J.V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Finally, Ldtfm was stereo-specific because no product was detected when l-Met was used as donor (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEExchange reaction (Ac2-l-Lys-d-Ala + X → Ac2-l-Lys-X + d-Ala) catalyzed by Ldtfm between Ac2-l-Lys-d-Ala and various acceptorsAcceptorProductMonoisotopic massRelative intensityaRelative ionic current intensity (product/product + substrate).CalculatedObserved%d-Methionine361.17361.1750d-2-Hydroxyhexanoic acid345.16345.1850d-Lactic acid302.16302.1737d-Asparagine344.17344.1820d-Glutamine358.18358.1920d-Serine317.17317.1718Glycine287.15287.1615d-Glutamic acid359.17359.1710d-Aspartic acid345.15345.1410d-Malic acid346.12346.1210Glycolic acid288.13NDbND, not detected.NDl-Methionine361.17NDNDa Relative ionic current intensity (product/product + substrate).b ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab The Ldtfm specificity for peptide donors was explored with the exchange assay using d-[14C]Ala as the acceptor. Formation of radioactive peptides was observed not only with Ac2-l-Lys-d-Ala (Fig. 2D) but also with the complete disaccharide tetrapeptide-(iAsn) peptidoglycan unit and with other donors containing a tetrapeptide ending in d-Ala. In contrast, no product was detected with Ac2-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala and compounds containing a pentapeptide ending in d-Ala-d-Ala. Thus, Ldtfm catalyzes peptidoglycan cross-linking exclusively with tetrapeptide-containing donors that are formed in vivo by the β-lactam-insensitive dd-carboxypeptidase according to the pathway depicted in Fig. 1B. Strikingly, the specificity of Ldtfm for a tetrapeptide donor ending in l-Lys3-d-Ala4 accounts for the lack of inhibition by β-lactams (Fig. 2E) because the drugs are structural analogues of the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 extremity of the pentapeptide stem of peptidoglycan precursors. Cross-linking of Peptidoglycan Subunits in Vitro—Because Ldtfm had all the characteristics expected for a peptidoglycan cross-linking enzyme, we investigated the formation of l-Lys3→d-iAsn-l-Lys3 cross-links with substrates closely mimicking the natural peptidoglycan precursors. Such substrates were prepared from the peptidoglycan of E. gallinarum, as it contains large amounts of uncross-linked monomers containing a tetrapeptide iAsn stem (19.Grohs P. Gutmann L. Legrand R. Schoot B. Mainardi J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6228-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ld-Transpeptidation was assayed with a reconstituted pool of three muropeptides to simultaneously test six combinations of donors and acceptors (Fig. 3A). Mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction products revealed formation of dimers with two types of donors (tetrapeptide and tetrapeptide-iAsn) and two types of acceptors (tetrapeptide-iAsn and tripeptide-iAsn) in the four possible combinations. The muropeptide containing an unsubstituted tetrapeptide stem was not used as an acceptor, indicating that the side-chain iAsn is essential. Accordingly, direct Lys3→l-Lys3 cross-links were not detected in the peptidoglycan of E. faecium M512 (12.Mainardi J.L. Legrand R. Arthur M. Schoot B. van Heijenoort J. Gutmann L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16490-16496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To confirm the structure of the dimers obtained in vitro, the reaction was scaled up and treated with ammonium hydroxide to cleave the ether link internal to MurNAc. This treatment produced lactoyl peptides, which are more amenable to sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry than disaccharide peptides (21.Arbeloa A. Hugonnet J.E. Sentilhes A.C. Josseaume N. Dubost L. Monsempes C. Blanot D. Brouard J.P. Arthur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41546-41556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This treatment was also found to convert d-iAsn into d-isoaspartyl. The fragmentation patterns (Fig. 3, B and C) demonstrated the in vitro formation of l-Lys3→d-iAsn-l-Lys3 cross-links by Ldtfm. Of note, dimer formation has not been obtained in the case of purified dd-transpeptidase (PBPs), except in very special cases involving highly reactive artificial substrates (e.g. thioester) or atypical enzymes (e.g. the soluble R61 dd-peptidase from Streptomyces spp.) (see Ref. 24.Anderson J.W. Adediran S.A. Charlier P. Nguyen-Disteche M. Frere J.M. Nicholas R.A. Pratt R.F. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 949-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a recent discussion). Thus, Ldtfm differs from the PBPs in its capacity to function in a soluble acellular system, a feature that could be exploited to design screens for the identification of cross-linking inhibitors. Physiological Function of Ldtfm—Similar Ldtfm activity is present in crude extracts from the ampicillin-resistant E. faecium mutant M512 and from the susceptible parental strain D344S (13.Mainardi J.L. Morel V. Fourgeaud M. Cremniter J. Blanot D. Legrand R. Frehel C. Arthur M. van Heijenoort J. Gutmann L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35801-35807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Western blot analysis of crude extracts from E. faecium D344S and M512 revealed similar amounts of the same form of Ldtfm corresponding to the full-length protein (data not shown). The identification of the corresponding gene, ldtfm, allowed us to confirm that its sequence was identical in both strains and in the E. faecium genome data base. These observations indicate that activation of the ld-transpeptidation pathway (Fig. 1B) does not involve modification of the activity of Ldtfm per se but that of the supply of the appropriate tetrapeptide donor substrate for the cross-linking reaction. The physiological role of the ld-transpeptidase in β-lactam-susceptible E. faecium is unknown. Previous analyses of the peptidoglycan structure in E. coli revealed that a small proportion of the cross-links is generated by ld-transpeptidation during the exponential phase of growth (∼5.8%) (25.Pisabarro A.G. De Pedro M.A. Vazquez D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 238-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An increase of their abundance during the stationary phase (∼11.3%) was attributed to a short supply of peptidoglycan subunits containing the pentapeptide required for dd-transpeptidation (25.Pisabarro A.G. De Pedro M.A. Vazquez D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 238-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the mature peptidoglycan of E. faecium contains virtually no pentapeptide stems (12.Mainardi J.L. Legrand R. Arthur M. Schoot B. van Heijenoort J. Gutmann L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16490-16496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we propose that Ldtfm may have a role in the maintenance of peptidoglycan structure because the enzyme can catalyze new cross-links without de novo incorporation of pentapeptide-containing subunits. Distribution of Ldtfm—Sequence comparisons indicated that Ldtfm is the first representative of a novel family of proteins that is sporadically distributed among taxonomically distant bacteria. Close homologues (Fig. 4) were detected in pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus anthracis and Enterococcus faecalis but not in S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Sequence similarity restricted to the C terminus of Ldtfm was also detected in proteins of unknown functions from other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, but the architecture and the domain composition of the proteins were different. This domain is related to 341 sequences from eubacteria appearing in the Protein Families Data Base of Alignments under the pfam accession number PF03734. Members of the family appear nearly ubiquitous, but none of them has been functionally characterized, and their putative involvement in β-lactam resistance has not been evaluated. Highly conserved residues of the C-terminal domain included Ser and Cys, present at positions 439 and 442 of Ldtfm (Fig. 4) as potential catalytic residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of Ldtfm led to an inactive protein for the C442A substitution. The mutant protein with the S439A substitution retained 2% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that Cys442 could be the catalytic residue of Ldtfm. In contrast, the PBPs possess an essential active site serine, which is acylated by their substrate and β-lactams. In conclusion, Ldtfm is the first characterized representative of a novel type of peptidoglycan transpeptidase. The wide distribution of Ldtfm homologues indicates that β-lactam resistance by the ld-transpeptidase bypass mechanism can potentially emerge in various pathogenic bacteria. The specificity of the Ldtfm for tetrapeptide substrates implies the lack of the β-lactam ring-associated activity of the most broadly used class of antimicrobial agents. This also implies that strategies applied previously to defeat other β-lactam resistance mechanisms, in particular by modification or replacement of the structures attached to the β-lactam ring, cannot be transposed to the development of ld-transpeptidase inhibitors. We thank D. Blanot for synthesis of Ac2-l-Lys-d-Ala, J. Cremniter and S. Mesnage for the production of the rabbit antiserum against Ldtfm and J. van Heijenoort, R. Menard, and F. Rusconi for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2070712184,"Fish androgens may start to surge only when there seems to be a good chance of winning a contest. It's not the taking part that counts, it's the winning. That's the conclusion to be drawn from a study of the combative Mozambique tilapia fish. These fish — the males that is — will show aggressive intent towards a rival and also towards their own image in a mirror. But the act of fighting does not induce a hormonal response (increased circulating androgen) when there is no outcome to the contest in a ‘virtual’ fight; that happens only in genuine combat. This may be an adaptive mechanism allowing individuals to mount an androgen response and enhance their social status once they have assessed the fighting ability of their challenger. Androgens are the principal sex steroids controlling reproduction and aggression in male fish1, but their production can also be affected by social interactions2,3. Here we show that androgen concentrations are not significantly increased in cichlid fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) that are fighting their own image in a mirror, despite their aggressive behaviour towards the virtual intruder. Our results indicate that the hormonal response normally triggered in male contests is not induced under these circumstances by the act of fighting itself, and that it may therefore depend on some indicator of relative fighting ability that cannot be delivered by a mirror-image challenger."

We have investigated the neurorescue effects of propargylamine, in a progressive neuronal death model, induced by long-term serum deprivation in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Propargylamine (0.1-10 microM) dose-dependently reduced the levels of the early apoptosis-associated phosphorylated protein, H2A-X (ser 139), as well as decreased the cleavage of caspase-3 and its substrate poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). In addition, the compound markedly reversed the apoptotic effects induced by long-term serum withdrawal, including down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, as well as up-regulation of the proapoptotic proteins, Bax, Bad, and Bim. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that propargylamine elevated gene expression levels of Bcl-2, and the neurotrophic factors glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reduced Bax gene expression. Serum deprivation increased mRNA and protein levels of holo-amyloid precursor protein (APP), which was markedly decreased by propargylamine. This was accompanied by inducing the release of the nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase form of soluble APP (sAPPalpha) into the medium. Similar effects on cell survival and APP regulation/processing were demonstrated for rasagiline. These results indicate that both rasagiline and propargylamine possess neurorescue activity, associated with regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, neurotrophic factors, and APP metabolism."

However, the Ca2+-binding amino acids delineating the Ca2+ binding pocket within the CaSR VFTM have not been identified, nor is it known if this Ca2+ binding cavity is conserved within class III receptors.In this study, we describe a homology model of the VFTM of the human CaSR built from the x-ray structure of the rat mGluR1 and a phylogenetic analysis of the ligand binding pocket of class III GPCRs. This model, which predicts the residues contributing to Ca2+ recognition, indicates that Ca2+ does not interact with amino acids homologous to those delineating the glutamate binding cavity but to a site adjacent to this cavity. We used mutational analysis, including the description and characterization of a novel mutation associated with ADH, and data from the literature to validate our model. In addition, our data are consistent with the presence of a conserved Ca2+ binding pocket within the VFTM of other class III GPCRs, adding a molecular basis for the previously observed effects of extracellular Ca2+ on the action of these receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIdentification of E297D Mutation in the CaSR Associated with ADH—Genomic DNA from the proband and family members was isolated from peripheral leukocytes using standard methods. CaSR exons 2-7 (proband) and exon 4 (all family members) and the corresponding intron-exon junctions were amplified using intronic primers (sequences available on request). PCR-amplified products were sequenced as described (24Prie D. Huart V. Bakouh N. Planelles G. Dellis O. Gerard B. Hulin P. Benque-Blanchet F. Silve C. Grandchamp B. Friedlander G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Wild-type (WT) cDNA encoding the human CaSR inserted in pcDNA3.1/Hygro plasmid was a kind gift of E. F. Nemeth and P. Jacobson (NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Missense mutations were introduced in the WT cDNA construct using the Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and were confirmed by complete sequencing of cDNA inserts (Genome Express, Meylan, France) (oligonucleotide sequences available on request).Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Western Blot Analysis—Experiments were performed in HEK293 cells. Techniques used for cell culture, transient transfection by electroporation, and the detection of WT and mutant CaSRs expression by Western blot analysis have been described (25Petrel C. Kessler A.

The measurement of [3H]IP accumulation was performed in freshly prepared buffer (125 mm NaCl; 4.0 mm KCl; 0.5 mm MgCl2; 20 mm Hepes; 0.1% d-glucose, pH 7.4) containing the indicated CaCl2 concentration (25Petrel C.

Two to five independent experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate using the same conditions. The data were fitted to a sigmoid doseresponse curve to determine EC50 values by using the GraphPAD Prism. Values for each curve were normalized to the maximal activation of each receptor, obtained by stimulation with 20 mm Ca2+. Significance was assayed by Excel 2000 Student's t test.Homology Modeling of the Amino-terminal Domain of the Calciumsensing Receptor—A multiple alignment of 14 class III GPCR extracellular domains (shown in supplemental Table 3) was obtained with the T-Coffee program (26Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5385) Google Scholar) Homology modeling of the human CaSR was performed with the SYBYL6.91 package (TRIPOS Associates Inc., St. Louis, MO) starting from monomer A of the mGluR1 x-ray structure (Protein Data Bank code 1ewk) (3Kunishima N.

The insertion of residues in loops between helix A and strand B, helix B and strand D, and helix L and helix M (3Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar) was accommodated by a knowledge-based loop search procedure as described previously (27Bissantz C. Bernard P. Hibert M. Rognan D. Proteins. 2003; 50: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Further energy refinement of the model was achieved by a standard minimization protocol using the AMBER 8 program (University of California, San Francisco). Mapping of the Ca2+-binding site was performed using the GRID version 20 software (28Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2439) Google Scholar) using a Ca2+ probe and standard settings for the grid definition. The most energetically favored location of the calcium ion was then used to minimize (by 1,000 steps of steepest descent followed by 1,000 steps of conjugate gradient refinement) the receptor model in the presence of Ca2+ and within a box of 23,844 TIP3P water molecules, placed automatically with the leap module of AMBER 8.0.Neighbor-joining Tree—19 residues lining the binding pocket of glutamate in the mGluR1 structure (3Kunishima N.

Tamura K. Jakobsen I.B. Nei M. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (4545) Google Scholar). A neighborjoining tree was calculated out of 100 bootstrap replicas using the γ correction for estimating pairwise protein distances.RESULTSIdentification of E297D Mutation in the CaSR Associated with ADH—The three generation pedigree of the family affected with ADH is shown in Fig. 1A. The index case was diagnosed during the 1st month of life because of severe hypocalcemic symptoms requiring calcium infusion. Biochemical features of the proband and family members at the time of diagnosis of hypocalcemia and identification of the activating mutation in the CaSR are shown in supplemental Table 5.Direct sequence analysis of the PCR-amplified CaSR exons led to the identification of a heterozygous G to C nucleotide substitution in exon 4 of the CaSR gene at position 889 of the CaSR cDNA sequence (Fig. 1B). This base change resulted in the substitution of glutamate for aspartate at position 297 (E297D) located in the extracellular domain. The E297D mutation was present in all affected family members and absent in others (data not shown). Most interestingly, a missense E297K mutation has been identified in subjects with FHH (30Pollak M.R. Brown E.M. Chou Y.H. Hebert S.C. Marx S.J. Steinmann B. Levi T. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G.

Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar, 4Bessis A.S. Rondard P. Gaven F.

This suggests that Glu-297 is part of the Ca2+ binding pocket of the CaSR. In an attempt to delineate the putative ligand binding pocket of this receptor, we first constructed a phylogenetic tree for 14 human class III GPCRs based on 19 residues (TABLE ONE) lining the glutamate binding cavity identified in the mGluR1 structure (3Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). This phylogenetic tree indicates that the CaSR-binding site is not closely related to that of any other receptors (Fig. 2A), including the GPRC6a receptor recognizing basic amino acids (7Wellendorph P. Hansen K.B. Balsgaard A. Greenwood J.R. Egebjerg J. Brauner-Osborne H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This latter receptor shows the highest overall homology with the CaSR (TABLE ONE and supplemental Table 4), but its ligand-binding site segregates more closely with that of the mGluRs (Fig. 2A). Most interestingly, the binding sites of the CaSR, T1R1, T1R2, T1R3, and GBR1 form a cluster distinct from that of mGluRs (Fig. 2A).TABLE ONEAlignment of 19 amino acids lining the orthosteric binding site of 14 human class III GPCRsReceptorBinding site residuesmGluR1Y74R78W110S164S165S166S186T188D208Q211Y236F290E292G293S317D318G319R323K409mGluR2R57R61S93Y144S145D146A166T168D188Q191Y226F269R271S272S294D295G296L300K377mGluR3R67R71S103Y153S154S155A175T177D197Q200Y225F278R280S281S303D304G305Q309K392mGluR4K74R78S110G158S159S160A180T182D202Q205Y230F284N286E287S311D312S313K317K405mGluR5Y64R68W100S151S152S153S173T175D195Q198Y223F277E279G280S304D305G306R310K396mGluR6Q64R68S100A153S154S155A175T177D197Q200Y225F279N281E282S306D307S308K312K400mGluR7N64R78S110G158S159S160A180T182D202Q205Y230F286N288D289S313D314S315K319K407mGluR8K71R75S107A155S156S160A177T179D199Q202Y227F281N283E284S308D309S310K314R401GPRC6aS69Q73T104Y148S149E150E170T172D192Q195Y220F277R279Q280S302D303N304A308E408GBR1G184C188D221C246S247S248G268S270A290H293V318L365Y367E368A397D398N399I403E466CaSRR66W70N102G146S147G148A168S170D190Q193Y218F270S272G273S296E297A298S302H413T1R1H71L75S107S148T149N150A170S172D192Q195Y220F274S226R227S300E301A302S306M383T1R2167L71Y103N143S144E145S165I167A187H190Y215F275P277D278S301E302S303D307E382T1R3N68W72S104S146S147E148G168S170D190Q193Y218F274S276V277S300E301A302S306H387 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Phylogenetic tree of class III GPCR ligand binding pocket (A) and molecular modeling of the human mGluR1 (B) and CaSR (C) ligand binding pockets.A, neighbor-joining tree of human class III GPCRs.

Comparison of the molecular models of the human mGluR1 and CaSR ligand binding pockets shows that the overall three-dimensional structure of the CaSR amino-terminal tail is very similar to the x-ray structure of the rat mGluR1 described by Kunishima et al. (3Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, B and C). Only three insertions in loop regions occur (see “Experimental Procedures”). The multiple sequence alignment used to thread the CaSR coordinates onto the mGluR1 structure (TABLE ONE and supplemental Table 4) shows only a single difference with that published (3Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar) and occurs just before the beginning of helix M at Lys-409, which is a glutamate-anchoring residue. We propose a shorter insertion (three amino acids instead of four) and a single-residue upward shift aligning His-413, and not Thr-412 (CaSR sequence), with Lys-409 (mGluR1 sequence). However, both residues present a side chain pointing inward toward the binding cavity and are putative anchoring residues for a ligand (Fig. 2, B and C). For the other 18 of the 19 residues lining the glutamate binding cavity, the multiple sequence alignment is unambiguous and identical to that proposed previously (3Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar).Our model shows that the CaSR presents a binding cavity between the two lobes of the amino-terminal domain, which is reminiscent of an amino acid-binding site but of smaller dimensions than that observed for the mGluR1 (47 versus 68 Å3, respectively) (Fig. 2, B and C). More importantly, however, Ca2+ is not predicted to bind within this pocket homologous to the glutamate binding cavity. Rather, the Ca2+ binding is predicted to occur within an adjacent site formed by a set of polar residues directly involved in Ca2+ coordination (Ser-170, Asp-190, Gln-193, Ser-296, and Glu-297) (Fig. 2C) with an additional set of residues contributing to complete the coordination sphere of the cation (Phe-270, Tyr-218, and Ser-147) through water interactions. A pentagonal bipyramidal coordination of metal is proposed, as is observed in many calcium-binding proteins (32Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Our present model identifies the presence of a Ca2+ binding pocket with the identification of Glu-193, Phe-270, Ser-296, and Glu-297 as novel potential residues involved in Ca2+ binding.The residues involved in this putative Ca2+-binding site are all conserved in T1R3 and all but one in T1R1 (Ser-147 in CaSR substituted by Thr-149 in T1R1) (TABLE TWO). They are also conserved in mGluRs and GPRC6a except for two residues (Ser-170 and Glu-297 in CaSR substituted by Thr and Asp, respectively, in mGluRs and GPRC6a). The lowest homology is found with T1R2 and GBR1 (TABLE TWO).TABLE TWOAmino acids lining the putative Ca2+-binding site of human class III GPCRsReceptorBinding residuesmGluR1S165T188D208Q211Y236F290S317D318mGluR2S145T168D188Q191Y226F269S294D295mGluR3S154T177D197Q200Y225F278S303D304mGluR4S159T182D202Q205Y230F284S311D312mGluR5S152T175D195Q198Y223F277S304D305mGluR6S154T177D197Q200Y225F279S306D307mGluR7S159T182D202Q205Y230F286S313D314mGluR8S156T179D199Q202Y227F281S308D309GPRC6aS149T172D192Q195Y220F277S302D303GBR1S247S270A290H293V318L365A397D398CaSRS147S170D190Q193Y218F270S296E297T1R1T149S172D192Q195Y220F274S300E301T1R2S144I167A187H190Y215F275S301E302T1R3S147S170D190Q193Y218F274S300E301 Open table in a new tab Functional Characterization of the Putative Ligand Contacting Residues—Four of the putative ligand contacting residues, Ser-147, Ser-170, Asp-190, and Tyr-218, have been shown previously to impair human CaSR activation when mutated to alanine (23Zhang Z.

Acta. 2002; 1580: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The other 70% of hepatic PC is made via the CDP-choline pathway. Additionally, PEMT coupled to PC catabolism is the only pathway for endogenous choline biosynthesis in animals. Insight into the essential role for PEMT came from studies in Pemt-/- mice. Whereas wild-type mice fed a choline-deficient (CD) diet developed mild fatty liver, mice that lacked PEMT and were fed a CD diet exhibited severe liver failure within 3 days and died at 4–5 days (11Walkey C.J. Yu L. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27043-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, Pemt-/- mice fed a CD diet are a unique model for “complete” choline deprivation because choline can be neither acquired from the diet nor made endogenously. The liver of a 20-g mouse contains ∼20 mg of PC and secretes ∼23 mg of PC into bile each day (12Kuipers F. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Verkade H.J. Groen A.K. Subcellular Biochemistry.in: Bitman R. Vol. 28. Plenum Press, New York1997: 295-318Google Scholar). Because livers from Pemt-/- mice lose ∼50% of their hepatic PC when fed a CD diet for 3 days (11Walkey C.J. Yu L. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27043-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we speculated that the rapid liver failure in Pemt-/- mice fed a CD diet was due to rapid depletion of hepatic PC by export into bile. To test this hypothesis we bred Pemt-/- mice with mice lacking MDR2. Remarkably, Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice adapted to a new PC/choline homeostasis and lived for at least 90 days when fed a CD diet. Animals—Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice were produced by breeding Pemt-/- mice (C57BL/6; 129/J background) (13Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with Mdr2-/-mice (FVB; 129/J background) (7Smit J.J. Schinkel A.H. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Groen A.K. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A. Ottenhoff R. van der Lugt N.M. van Roon M.A. van der Valk M.A. Offerhaus G.J.A. Berns A.J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1993; 75: 451-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). The mice were fed a CD diet, a semi-synthetic diet without choline (ICN, catalog number 0290138710), or a choline-supplemented (CS) diet (a CD diet containing 0.4% (w/w) choline chloride). At the age of 10–12 weeks, Pemt-/- and Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice were fed a CS diet for 24 h and then switched to the CD diet for 3–90 days. Mice were fasted for 12 h before sacrifice. Four to eight mice of each gender were used for each time point in all experiments, and assays were performed in duplicate. All data are presented as means ± S.D. p values are from comparisons between CS and CD mice. Genotyping—As PCR templates, genomic DNA from tails of mice was extracted with a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). Specific PCR reactions were used to distinguish between wild-type alleles and knock-out alleles containing a neomycin resistance gene (neo). Primer sequences were as follows: 5′-GAGCGCAATGGTACTCACCACATTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATCTTGTCTTCAGAGCCACAG-3′ (reverse) for the Pemt gene; 5′-GAGCGCAATGGTACTCACCACATTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCGACGTTGTCGAAG-3′ (reverse) for the Pemt knock-out allele; 5′-GCTGAGATGGATCTTGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCGAGTAGCCAGATGATGG-3′ (reverse) for the Mdr2 gene; and 5′-CGGCGAGGATCTCGTCGTGACCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGATACCGTAAAGCACGAGGAAG-3′ (reverse) for the Mdr2 knock-out allele. Preparation of Primary Hepatocytes—Pemt-/- mice and Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice were fed a CS diet for 24 h. The Pemt-/- mice were then fed the CD diet for 2 days (CD2), and the Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice were fed the CD diet for 3 (CD3) or 21 (CD21) days. Hepatocytes were prepared and cultured (14Klaunig J.E. Goldblatt P.J. Hinton D.E. Lipsky M.M. Chacko J. Trump B.F. In Vitro. 1981; 17: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) in CS medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 17% fetal bovine serum) or CD medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without choline plus 17% delipidated/dialyzed fetal bovine serum). Analyses of Lipids and Choline Metabolites—Livers were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in 5 volumes of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8340)). The homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g, and supernatants were collected. Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Total lipids were extracted from liver homogenates, plasma, and bile (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and quantified with a light scattering detector (17McCluer R.H. Ullman M.D. Jungalwala F.B. Adv. Chromatogr. 1986; 25: 309-353PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine was used as an internal standard for quantification. The aqueous phase from the lipid extraction was collected and lyophilized. Aqueous choline metabolites were separated by thin layer chromatography, subjected to acid hydrolysis, and quantified with a Wako Phospholipids B test kit (18Pelech S.L. Pritchard P.H. Vance D., E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8283-8286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hise M.K. Mansbach II, C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—Plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities were measured with a GPT/GOT kit (Sigma, catalog number P505). Choline oxidase activity was determined by incubation of choline with mitochondrial fractions isolated as the pellet obtained after centrifugation of liver homogenates at 12,000 × g for 15 min (20Schneider W.J. Vance D.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Choline kinase activity was measured in liver homogenates (21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity was assayed in both liver homogenates and membrane fractions (100,000 × g pellet) (22Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLA2 activity was measured in liver homogenates and in primary hepatocytes with N-((6-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)amino)hexanoyl)-2-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine triethylammonium salt (PED6; Invitrogen), a self-quenching BODIPY fluorescent analog of phosphatidylethanolamine and a substrate specific for PLA2 (23Farber S.A. Pack M. Ho S.Y. Johnson I.D. Wagner D.S. Dosch R. Mullins M.C. Hendrickson H.S. Hendrickson E.K. Halpern M.E. Science. 2001; 292: 1385-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were incubated with PED6 liposomes for 2 h and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Phospholipase C and D activities were measured in liver homogenates with PC as substrate (24Krug E.L. Kent C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Tracing PC Metabolism—[3H]Glycerol or [3H]choline was added to culture media to trace PC metabolism in primary cultured hepatocytes from Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice. Primary hepatocytes were incubated with [3H]glycerol or [3H]choline for 2 h, and then the radiolabel was chased for 2 h. The rates of PC synthesis and degradation were calculated as described previously (25Ko K.W. Cook H.W. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7846-7852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PC biosynthetic rate equals the increase in dpm in [3H]PC per mg of protein from [3H]choline between the end of the pulse and after 2 h of chase divided by 2 h times the nmol of phosphocholine per mg of protein at the beginning of the pulse. PC degradation rate equals the decrease in dpm in [3H]PC per mg of protein derived from [3H]glycerol between the end of the pulse and after 2 h of chase divided by 2 h times the nmol of PC per mg of protein. The relative rates are presented as a comparison between CS and CD hepatocytes. Formation of [3H]PC from [3H]GPC was monitored by incubation of 1 × 106 primary cultured hepatocytes from Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice with 60 mmol/liter [3H]GPC for 2 h in CS or CD medium. Biliary Secretion of PC Is Lethal in CD-Pemt-/- Mice—To understand why complete choline deprivation is lethal (i.e. why Pemt-/- mice die from choline deprivation), Pemt-/- mice and Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice were fed a CD diet for 3 days. In Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice no liver damage was observed as indicated by a low level of the hepatic enzymes alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in plasma (Fig. 1B and results not shown). Hepatic total choline-containing metabolites, including PC, in Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice were decreased by only ∼20% compared with the >50% decrease in CD-Pemt-/- mice after 3 days of the CD diet (Fig. 1C). Biliary PC levels were negligible in Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice (Fig. 1D), whereas CD-Pemt-/- mice continuously depleted hepatic PC for 3 days via biliary secretion (Fig. 1D, inset). Because ∼60% of hepatic PC is excreted via biliary secretion each day (26Borgstrom B. Lipid Absorption: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects. 1976; : 65-72Crossref Google Scholar, 27Robins S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1975; 229: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we conclude that the lethality of choline deprivation in Pemt-/- mice emanates primarily from the rapid depletion of hepatic PC via biliary excretion. When Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice were fed the CD diet for 21 days, total choline-containing compounds in the liver decreased by ∼50% and remained at this level for 3 months (Fig. 1C), even though there was neither endogenous synthesis of choline via PEMT nor any dietary choline. Thus, adaptation to choline deprivation directed Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice into a new state of PC homeostasis. Enhanced PC Metabolism in CD-Pemt-/-/Mdr2-/- Mice—To preserve PC levels in mice fed the CD diet, we expected that the activity of phospholipases, especially PLA2, which is quantitatively the most important enzyme for PC catabolism (28Waite M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 279: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), would decrease. Indeed, PLA2 activity was decreased ∼50% in livers of CD-Pemt-/- mice after 3 days (Fig. 2A). In contrast, hepatic PLA2 activity was increased ∼3-fold in CD-Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice (Fig. 2A). That this was PLA2 activity was further indicated by inhibition of the activity with a PLA2-specific inhibitor, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (Fig. 2A). PLA2 activity was also assayed in cultured hepatocytes derived from CD-Pemt mice and CD-Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice. Hepatocytes were incubated with the PLA2-specific substrate PED6 (23Farber S.A. Pack M. Ho S.Y. Johnson I.D. Wagner D.S. Dosch R. Mullins M.C. Hendrickson H.S. Hendrickson E.K. Halpern M.E. Science. 2001; 292: 1385-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), a derivative of PE containing a fluorescence-labeled fatty acid at the sn-2 position and a modified head-group that quenches fluorescence from the fatty acid. When the fatty acid is cleaved from the lipid by PLA2, fluorescence is detectable. Fig. 2B shows that feeding the CD diet for 3 days increased PLA2 activity in hepatocytes from CD-Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice but not from CD-Pemt-/- mice. The activities of phospholipases C and D were decreased in livers of Pemt-/- mice fed the CD diet for 3 days, whereas in the livers of CD-Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice there was an initial decrease in these activities followed by a return to normal levels (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the capacity for PC degradation via PLA2 was significantly increased in Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice fed the CD diet. PC metabolism generates sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylcholine, GPC, phosphocholine, and choline. No significant change in levels of hepatic sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, or lysophosphatidylcholine was observed upon feeding the CD diet to either Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice or Pemt-/- mice (data not shown), whereas hepatic choline and GPC levels decreased significantly in Pemt-/- mice (Fig. 2, C and D). The quantitatively more important hepatic choline metabolite, phosphocholine, decreased dramatically in CD-Pemt-/- mice by 3 days (Fig. 2C) but did not decline significantly for at least 90 days in CD-Mdr2-/-/Pemt mice (Fig. 2D). Thus, choline and phosphocholine were preserved for PC biosynthesis in CD-Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice. The only pathway for catabolism of choline is oxidation to betaine (Fig. 1A). Choline oxidase was almost completely inactivated by choline deprivation for 3 days in both Pemt-/- and Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the activity of choline kinase was initially stimulated ∼2-fold in Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice after 3 days of CD diet and then gradually declined (Fig. 3B). Choline kinase is not considered to be rate-limiting for PC biosynthesis via CDP-choline (29Vance D.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. 2002: 205-232Google Scholar). Instead, CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase is the rate-limiting enzyme (Fig. 1A). CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity increased ∼3-fold when Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice were fed the CD diet for 21 days, and this level of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity was maintained for at least 90 days (Fig. 3C). The activity of the membrane-associated form of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (the active form) was similarly increased by the CD diet (data not shown). These data demonstrate that Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice adjust their metabolism to ensure that available choline is channeled toward PC biosynthesis. Adaptation to Complete Choline Deprivation—Because the above data suggest that Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice adapt their hepatic metabolism of PC in response to the CD diet, we investigated this adjustment further in intact hepatocytes. [3H]Glycerol and [3H]choline were used to trace PC metabolism in primary hepatocytes isolated from Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice. Fig. 3D indicates that both the biosynthesis and degradation of PC were increased in response to the CD diet. Fig. 3, A and D demonstrate that complete choline deprivation in CD-Mdr2-/- mice activates choline production by increasing PC degradation and inhibiting choline oxidation. Thus, choline recycling was initiated and enhanced. In addition to these compensatory mechanisms, PC was further preserved in Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice during choline deprivation by an increased incorporation of GPC into PC (Fig. 4A), indicating that choline recycling is enhanced to conserve the levels of total choline-containing metabolites. Enhanced choline recycling, therefore, allows the utilization of choline more efficiently when PC levels drop to 50% during choline deprivation. The rapid decline in hepatic total choline-containing metabolites in CD-Pemt-/- mice was incompatible with life beyond 4–5 days (11Walkey C.J. Yu L. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27043-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, a more gradual reduction in choline-containing metabolites provided sufficient time for Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice to adapt to the stress of choline deprivation. A minimum threshold of total choline-containing compounds in the liver for survival is suggested to be ∼110 nmol/mg protein (Fig. 1C). The level of total choline-containing compounds in Pemt-/- mice fed a CD diet for 3 days fell below this baseline. Thus, the CD-Pemt-/- mice faced a severe choline deficiency, whereas the CD-Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice were able to establish a new choline homeostasis, thereby conserving sufficient amounts of choline metabolites for viability (Fig. 4, B and C). After 3 days of the CD diet, a turning point between life and death was reached. This threshold was critically dependent on the phosphocholine levels but not other choline-containing metabolites (Fig. 4, B and C). The data from these experiments provide unambiguous evidence that the liver failure in Pemt-/- mice fed the CD diet results from continued secretion of PC into bile during a time when PC biosynthesis is severely curtailed. The rapidity with which PC levels decrease in Pemt-/- mice apparently allows no time for the mice to adapt to the crisis in PC biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, the levels of PC also decreased in Mdr2-/- mice fed the CD diet for 21 days even though these mice no longer secrete PC into bile. The decrease in PC can be explained by the 3-fold increase in PLA2 activity within the first 21 days of the CD diet. Importantly, the decrease in PC occurs more gradually in CD-Mdr2-/ -/Pemt- mice, allowing them to adapt to the decrease in PC biosynthesis by maintaining the pool of phosphocholine, a substrate for CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme in PC biosynthesis. PEMT plays an important role in PC and choline homeostasis in individual organisms. Rodents do not have significant PEMT activity before birth (30Cui Z. Shen Y.-J. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, Pemt-/- mice develop normally and have a normal life span (11Walkey C.J. Yu L. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27043-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 31Vance D.E. Walkey C.J. Cui Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, dietary choline is adequate for life independent of PEMT. However, PEMT compensates for the lack of dietary choline (32Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2839-2843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PEMT, therefore, becomes critical when dietary choline is not adequate, as may occur during starvation, pregnancy, or lactation. PEMT is also important because it contributes to the total pool of choline in the biosphere. Plants make choline by methylation of phosphoethanolamine (33Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 854-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and yeast synthesizes choline from both the methylation of PE and the methylation of phosphoethanolamine (34Voelker D.R. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 441-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mammals obtain choline from their diet and from the PEMT pathway. Therefore, all choline in nature is ultimately derived from the methylation of ethanolamine in the form of PE or phosphoethanolamine. Fig. 4D summarizes the adaptations that facilitate survival of CD-Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice. By eliminating the loss of PC into bile, these mice are able to implement significant changes in PC and choline metabolism. Notably, the oxidation of choline to betaine is markedly curtailed, and choline kinase and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activities are increased to ensure re-utilization of choline for PC biosynthesis. Another adaptation is that PLA2 activity and PC catabolism are increased to ensure an ample supply of phosphocholine for PC biosynthesis. The gradual reduction of hepatic PC in Mdr2-/-/Pemt-/- mice fed the CD diet provided sufficient time for regulatory mechanisms to be triggered and for adaptation to the stress of choline deprivation. The conversion of choline into PC generates a large reserve pool of choline that can be readily accessible at times of high demand, which may explain why rodents and humans do not die from dietary choline deficiency. Several choline metabolites have been used in clinical therapy. For example, citicoline (CDP-choline) is used to treat brain disorders such as cognitive and memory impairment and stroke (35Fioravanti M. Yanagi M. Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 2005; : CD000269PubMed Google Scholar, 36Adibhatla R.M. Hatcher J.F. Neurochem. Res. 2005; 30: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Betaine is used to treat patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (37Abdelmalek M.F. Angulo P. Jorgensen R.A. Sylvestre P.B. Lindor K.D. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 96: 2711-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms behind these treatments are still unclear. Our studies provide new clues about choline and PC homeostasis that might help elucidate the mechanisms for these treatments. Moreover, our results might lead to more potent therapeutics for these disorders. We thank Sandra Ungarian, Susanne Lingrell, Audric Moses, and Priscilla Gao for excellent technical assistance. We thank Prof. Jean Vance and Dr. Yang Zhao for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2119607029,"The ischemic stroke is the third leading cause of death in developed countries. The C-terminal peptide of mechano-growth factor (MGF), an alternatively spliced variant of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), was found to function independently from the rest of the molecule and showed a neuroprotective effect in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, in a gerbil model of transient brain ischemia, treatment with the synthetic MGF C-terminal peptide provided very significant protection to the vulnerable neurons. In the same model, ischemia evoked increased expression of endogenous MGF in the ischemia-resistant hippocampal neurons, suggesting that the endogenous MGF might have an important neuroprotective function. In an in vitro organotypic hippocampal culture model of neurodegeneration, the synthetic peptide was as potent as the full-length IGF-1 while its effect lasted significantly longer than that of recombinant IGF-1. While two peptides showed an additive effect, the neuroprotective action of the C-terminal MGF was independent from the IGF-1 receptor, indicating a new mode of action for this molecule. Although MGF is known for its regenerative capability in skeletal muscle, our findings demonstrate for the first time a neuroprotective role against ischemia for this specific IGF-1 isoform. Therefore, the C-terminal MGF peptide has a potential to be developed into a therapeutic modality for the prevention of neuronal damage."

Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7529) Google Scholar). GSH is synthesized de novo by the consecutive action of two enzymes: glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL, EC 6.3.2.2), which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis (Reaction 1), and GSH synthase (GS, EC 6.3.2.3), which links glycine to γ-glutamylcysteine (γ-GC) to form GSH (Reaction 2) (4Ziegler D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 305-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The primary determinants of the rate of GSH synthesis are the availability of substrates, activity of GCL, and feedback inhibition of GCL by GSH (7Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar).

Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GCLc subunit can catalyze the formation of γ-GC in the absence of GCLm, but its activity is increased substantially by covalent interactions with GCLm. GCL activity is increased under oxidative stress, i.e. an imbalance between antioxidants and prooxidants, by the formation of disulfide bonds between the GCLm and GCLc subunits (7Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 9Shi M.M. Kugelman A. Iwamoto T. Tian L. Forman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26512-26517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidants can also differentially up-regulate the transcription of GCL genes, thereby providing a protective mechanism against oxidative stress-induced cellular dysfunction. A considerable body of evidence indicates that GSH provides protection against oxidative stress in vivo. For instance, experimental depletion of GSH by l-buthionine-SR-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GCL activity, results in enhanced vulnerability to oxidative challenges (10Mårtensson J. Jain A. Stole E. Frayer W. Auld P.A.M. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9360-9364Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Transfection of cells with GCLc cDNAs elevates GSH levels as well as resistance to oxidative stress (11Moore W.R. Anderson M.E. Meister A. Murata K. Kimura A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1461-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The amount of GSH and the ability to maintain its steady-state level under oxidative stress tend to decrease in some tissues with increasing age, which is hypothesized to be reflective of an impairment of the mechanisms of GSH synthesis (12Bharath S. Hsu M. Kaur D. Rajagopalan S. Andersen J.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Indeed, a recent study of the housefly indicates that GCL has significantly higher affinities for its substrates in young than in old flies, suggesting the occurrence of a catalytic inefficiency of the rate-limiting step of glutathione biosynthesis (13Toroser D. Sohal R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the level of oxidative stress is enhanced during the aging process (14Sohal R.S. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). For instance, rates of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation and steady-state amounts of the products of reactions between reactive oxygen speices and macromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids are relatively high in aged animals. Furthermore, aged organisms are more susceptible to induced oxidative damage than the young. In this context, the principal objective of this study was to examine the role of GSH and oxidative stress in the aging process, using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. Molecular cloning of both a ∼31-kDa regulatory subunit and a ∼80-kDa catalytic subunit has been accomplished in Drosophila (15Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1158-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the specific hypothesis was that overexpression of Drosophila GCL catalytic and modulatory subunits, using global and tissue-specific promoters, would enhance the ability to synthesize GSH and prolong the life span. Chemicals and Reagents—HPLC calibration standards (γ-GC and GSH) were obtained from Sigma. o-Phosphoric acid was purchased from EMD Science (Gibbstown, NJ). Milli-Q grade water was prepared by reverse osmosis on a Millipore® water-purification system. All chemicals were either analytical grade or of the highest purity commercially available. Construction of pP[UAST]-GCLc and pP[UAST]-GCLm—The EcoRI-BamHI fragment of the GCLc gene was digested from AT05811 cDNA clone (BDGP) plasmid DNA and subcloned into corresponding sites of the pBluescript SKII(–) vector. The 5′-EcoRI site was derived from the polylinker of the POT7 vector of the AT05811 clone, whereas the BamHI site was located in the 3′-untranslated region of the GCLc mRNA. The resulting construct contained 42 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence of the GCLc gene, the entire coding region (2157 bp) and 374 bp downstream from the GCLc gene stop codon. This 2573-bp GCLc fragment was subsequently excised from the EcoRI and XbaI sites, which flank the sequence, and introduced into corresponding sites in the polylinker of the pP[UAST] vector. For the construction of pP[UAST]-GCLm, the EcoRI-XhoI fragment of the GCLm gene was extracted from GH01757 cDNA clone (BDGP) and subcloned into the corresponding EcoRI-XhoI sites of the polylinker of pP[UAST] vector. The 5′-EcoRI and the 3′-XhoI sites were both provided by the polylinker of pOT2A vector of the GH01757 clone. The resulting construct contained 77 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence of the GCLm mRNA, the entire coding domain (857 bp) and 202 bp downstream from the stop codon. Drosophila Strains, P-mediated Transformation, and Life Span Studies—The y w strain used in these studies contains the X chromosome markers yellow (y) and white (w) and has been maintained in this laboratory for >12 years. The Tub-GAL4, elav-GAL4, Appl-GAL4, and D42-GAL4 driver lines were kindly supplied by Blanka Rogina (University of Connecticut Health Science Center). DNA preparations of pP[UAST]-GCLc and pP[UAST]-GCLm constructs were injected along with pTurbo plasmid (16Tomlinson A. Kimmel B.E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 771-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) carrying transposase into Drosophila embryos of the y w recipient strain. Southern analysis and chromosome mapping were used to confirm the presence of single individual transgenes at distinct loci after microinjection. The collection of transgenic lines was further expanded using transient remobilization by the Δ2–3 element (17Robertson H.M. Preston C.R. Phillis R.W. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Benz W.K. Engels W.R. Genetics. 1988; 118: 461-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) following crosses with CyO/Sp; Sb Δ2–3/TM6, Ubx flies. All transgenic lines, including the driver lines, were back-crossed a minimum of six times to the same yw isoline, to ensure that the genetic backgrounds were equivalent. Experimental flies were then obtained from crosses between virgin females containing the GAL4 driver and males containing the UAS-GCLc or UAS-GCLm responder transgene. Control flies containing the GCL transgene alone or the GAL4 driver alone were obtained by substituting the parental yw strain for either the driver or responder strain in parallel crosses. Life-span studies were performed as described previously (18Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Antibodies were raised against recombinant GCLc and GCLm proteins. Fragments of GCLc and GCLm genes comprising the whole-length coding sequences were inserted in pProEx vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with histidine-6x sequence. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5-α and purified by nickel-agarose chromatography. Purified proteins were sent to Covance Research Products (Denver, PA) for the preparation of rabbit antisera. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (19Radyuk S.N. Klichko V.I. Orr W.C. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2000; 45: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies (∼0.2–0.5 mg/ml) were diluted 1:5,000 (GCLc) or 1:20,000 (GCLm). Anti-actin antibodies used as a loading control were purchased from MP Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit and anti-mouse conjugates (Invitrogen and Amersham Biosciences, respectively). HPLC-based Assays of GCL Enzyme Activity and Glutathione Content in Fly Homogenates—GCL enzyme activity was measured as described previously for houseflies (13Toroser D. Sohal R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). GSH present in the fly homogenates at the time of sacrifice was also quantified by HPLC, using a Shimadzu Class VP solvent delivery system and CoulArray 6500 electrochemical detector, as described previously (20Rebrin I. Bayne A.C.V. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Oxygen Consumption—Respiration rates were determined for three to five groups of 25 male flies per genotype, at ages 13–20 days, using an Oxzilla Dual Absolute and Differential Oxygen Analyzer (Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, NV). Flies in each group were placed in a respiration chamber with nearly the same dimensions as standard vials used for life-span studies. Air was passed through the chamber and baselining system in alternating 10-min intervals, with a flow rate of 50 ml·min–1 and sampling interval of 2 s. The calculated rate of oxygen consumption for each vial of flies was the average of five to six consecutive chamber minus baseline estimations, after subtraction from oxygen concentration in a parallel reference channel. Statistical Analysis—Enzyme activities (overexpressor versus control) were compared by unpaired Student's t tests using Microsoft Excel software. Rates of oxygen consumption were compared by analysis of variance, with post hoc pairwise comparisons based on Tukey tests. The significance of differences between Kaplan-Meier survival curves was determined separately for each experimental combination and its corresponding driver-only and responder-only controls, using semiparametric log rank tests (SYSTAT 10 software). Additionally, the mean life spans and 90% mortality times of all genotypes were compared by analysis of variance, with planned, pairwise comparisons between GCLc overexpressors and the corresponding driver-only and responder-only controls. Overexpression of GCLc and GCLm—Microinjection of the recombinant P element plasmids yielded 14 independent transformants carrying UAS-GCLc and 5 transformants carrying UAS-GCLm transgenes. Southern analysis was performed to select fly lines carrying unique insertions, which were mapped to specific chromosomes by segregation analysis. For each UAS construct, three to four different transgenic lines with a single insertion were selected and back-crossed a minimum of six times into a reference yw background to ensure genetic homogeneity. The responder strains carrying the UAS-GCL transgenes were mated to the following driver strains: Tub-GAL4, which drives constitutive, broad-range expression, and elav-Gal4, Appl-GAL4, and D42-GAL4, which drive distinct patterns of neuronal expression. Expression of GCLc and GCLm driven by Tub-GAL4 was increased by 4- to 6-fold and 60–100%, respectively, in comparison with controls, as revealed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown) and the GCL enzyme activity assay (Fig. 1). When neuronal drivers were used, only slight increases in GCL activity were noted in whole body homogenates (Fig. 1A); the same was true when GCL protein levels were determined by Western analysis. More pronounced differences in GCL content were detected in proteins extracted from heads, using either global or neuronal drivers of GCLc overexpression (Fig. 2). GCL enzyme activity was increased significantly in heads but not in the thoraces and abdomens of Appl/GCLc flies (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2Immunoblot analysis of GCL expression. A, proteins were isolated from heads of GCLc transgenic flies, and 10 μg of each lysate was immunoblotted using primary antibodies raised against Drosophila GCLc (top panel), or actin as a loading control (bottom panel). There was a marked increase in the GCL protein content of flies containing the Appl, D42, elav, or Tub driver in combination with the GCLc responder transgenes.

Experimental flies contained one of four distinct target UAS-GCLc transgenes and either the Tub-GAL4, Appl-GAL4, D42-GAL4, or elav-GAL4 driver. Controls for each driver/UAS-GCLc transgene combination included the UAS-GCLc transgene without the driver and the driver without its transgene UAS target. The experimental groups overexpressing GCLc globally (UAS-GCLc with the Tub-GAL4 driver) exhibited no significant increases in life span, in comparison with their respective controls. In the presence of Appl-GAL4 and D42-GAL4 neuronal drivers, however, there was a substantial, reproducible, and statistically significant increase in longevity (Fig. 4) (p < 0.01, based on log rank tests or comparisons of mean life spans). Positive effects were also observed with the elav-GAL4 driver, but these effects were consistently significant (p < 0.05) only for the elav/GCLc5 genotype. Both mean and maximum life spans (90% mortality) were increased by up to 50% (TABLES ONE and TWO); however, the effects on maximum life span were consistently significant only for two out of four genotypes for the Appl-GAL4 and D42-GAL4 drivers. Overall, the rank order of impact on life span was Appl-GAL4 > D42-GAL4 > elav-GAL4.TABLE ONEMean life spans of GCLc transgenic fliesGenotypeMean% vs. +/responderMantel p% vs. Driver/+Mantel pdays%%y w; +/+48.3y w; +/GCLc354.2y w; +/GCLc553.3y w; +/GCLc655.9Tubulin/+63.4Tubulin/GCLc364.819.6<0.00052.30.579Tubulin/GCLc548.7-8.60.035-23.2<0.0005Tubulin/GCLc648.6-13.2<0.0005-23.4<0.0005elav/+51.9elav/GCLc364.418.8<0.000524.0<0.0005elav/GCLc574.539.8<0.000543.4<0.0005elav/GCLc649.2-12.0<0.0005-5.20.589D42/+54.8D42/GCLc372.233.2<0.000531.8<0.0005D42/GCLc573.137.3<0.000533.5<0.0005D42/GCLc674.934.0<0.000536.7<0.0005Appl/+61.1Appl/GCLc374.537.3<0.000522.0<0.0005Appl/GCLc579.148.5<0.000529.5<0.0005Appl/GCLc683.549.3<0.000536.8<0.0005 Open table in a new tab TABLE TWOMean life spans of GCLc transgenic flies in replicate experimentsMeany w; +/+y w; +/GCLc3y w; +/GCLc5y w; +/GCLc6daysy w; +/+48.354.253.355.953.360.362.861.450.450.151.0y w; Tub/+63.464.848.748.666.461.053.752.745.2elav/+51.964.474.549.250.952.053.162.554.4y w D42/+54.872.273.174.954.672.263.667.4y w Appl/+61.174.579.183.559.373.473.578.1 Open table in a new tab In contrast to the results obtained for GCLc, neuronal overexpression of the regulatory subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, GCLm, had no impact on longevity. However, when the Tub-GAL4 driver was used, a small but reproducible extension of life span was noted (up to 24% for mean life span; Fig. 5). GSH Content—To determine whether or not overexpression of GCLc or GCLm resulted in an increased content of GSH, lysates from a subset of the transgenic flies were analyzed by HPLC. There was a statistically significant, 85–104% increase in GSH content in experimental flies containing the target, UAS-GCLc, together with the global driver, Tub-GAL4 (Fig. 6). Flies with the elav-GAL4/UAS-GCLc transgene combinations had small but significant increases in GSH levels (10–23%), reflecting the fact that neuronal tissue constitutes only a small fraction of the body weight. Consistent with this observation, GSH content was increased 70–118% in the heads but only 16–29% in the thoraces plus abdomens of Appl/GCLc flies (Fig. 7). In GCLm overexpressors containing the global Tub-GAL4 driver, the increases in GSH content ranged from 25–50%.FIGURE 7GSH content in heads (H) and in headless bodies (B, thoraces plus abdomens) of Appl/GCLc flies. Results are expressed per milligram of fly weight and are mean ± S.E. of three measurements.

Percent increases in GSH content and t test p values for each experimental group (black bars) are based on comparisons with the corresponding +/GCLc controls (white bars). The GSH content of whole body homogenates of control flies was similar to the amount measured in headless bodies, whereas differences between control and experimental groups were intermediate between those observed for heads and for headless bodies (+23 to + 67%, p < 0.01 for all three groups). n.s., not significant; A, Appl-GAL4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oxygen Consumption and Resistance to Experimental Oxidative Stress—Rates of oxygen consumption were compared between flies containing both the Appl-GAL4 or elav-GAL4 driver and the UAS-GCLc6 responder transgene in combination, and controls containing either the driver or responder transgene alone. There was no significant difference between experimental and control groups for either driver (Fig. 8), suggesting that the extension of life span was not an indirect effect resulting from decreased respiration rates in the long-lived flies. Additionally, although there were no beneficial effects on stress resistance for any of the drivers at 10 days of age, 40-day-old Appl/GCLc and D42/GCLc flies exhibited increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat (Figs. 9 and 10).FIGURE 9Resistance of 40-day-old flies to 0.125 m hydrogen peroxide.

In contrast, GCLm overexpression in the CNS had no effect on life span, whereas global overexpression resulted in a moderate increase in longevity. The main issue raised by these findings is how overexpression of GCLc, specifically in the CNS, extends the life span of flies. The brain of aging Drosophila is known to undergo a number of degenerative changes, including vacuolization, decreased amounts of neuronal cytoplasm and ribosomes, and a progressive accumulation of age pigments, which may be products of mitochondrial degradation (21Herman M.M. Miquel J. Johnson M. Acta Neuropath. 1971; 19: 167-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Additionally, the level of oxidative stress in flies, indicated by rates of mitochondrial \(O2⋅¯/H2O2\) generation, GSH:glutathione disulfide ratios, and amounts of macromolecular oxidative damage, increases with age (14Sohal R.S. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 20Rebrin I. Bayne A.C.V. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, GCLc overexpression was found to enhance the amount of GSH, which has multiple functions in cells, acting as a reductant or a nucleophile for the detoxification of reactive intermediates. It can react directly with a variety of radical species, generating glutathionyl radical, which after subsequent reactions produces O2⋅¯ , a substrate of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (22Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Glutathione and SOD, acting in concert, are hypothesized to provide a crucial mechanism for the elimination of various reactive oxygen species, with O2⋅¯ acting as an intracellular radical “sink” (22Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The existence of such a sink could explain why the results for GCL are similar to those obtained by overexpressing Cu,Zn-SOD in the nervous system, which also extends the life span of Drosophila (14Sohal R.S. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 23Parkes T.L. Elia A.J. Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The CNS of D. melanogaster may be relatively vulnerable to age-associated increases in oxidative stress, because it has a low content of Cu,Zn-SOD in comparison with other tissues (24Klichko V.I. Radyuk S.N. Orr W.C. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The absence of life extension resulting from global elevation of GSH content in GCLc transgenic flies raises the possibility that antioxidative defenses in other tissues are adequate and that adverse effects of overexpression outside the CNS may offset the beneficial effect in the CNS. Alternatively, the effect of GCL overexpression may be dose-dependent, with moderate increases in activity counteracting age-related oxidative stress, while dramatic increases interfere with redox-related signal transduction or protein folding. In support of this idea, the global increases in GCL activity and GSH content were much greater in Tub/GCLc than in elav/GCLc flies. Another possible explanation, that Tub/GCLc flies failed to overexpress GCLc sufficiently in the nervous system, is inconsistent with the finding that GCL protein content was similar in the heads of GCLc transgenic flies possessing global versus neuronal drivers. Thus, the greatest extension of life span appears to be achieved by overexpressing GCL at moderate rather than extremely high levels, and by targeting the overexpression of GCL to the CNS. The differential, tissue-specific, life-extending effects of GCLc and GCLm overexpression may be due to differences in their roles in GSH biosynthesis, and variations in substrate abundance among tissues. The isolated Drosophila GCLc monomer exhibits catalytic activity (15Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1158-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but the formation of reversible intermolecular disulfide bridges with GCLm decreases the Km for glutamate from 2.88 mm to 0.45 mm, and diminishes feedback inhibition by GSH. This difference in Km could account for the extension of life span by global overexpression of GCLm, because the concentration of glutamate in the Drosophila hemolymph is 0.9 mm (25Schuster C.M. Ultsch A. Schmitt B. Betz H. EXS. 1993; 63: 234-240PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the monomeric GCLc subunit functions less efficiently in GSH synthesis outside the CNS than the heterodimeric holoenzyme. Consistent with the hypothesis that maximal increases in GCL activity have adverse effects, the difference in Km for glutamate could also explain the lethal effect of simultaneous, global overexpression of both GCLc and GCLm during metamorphosis. Conversely, the absence of life extension resulting from neuronal overexpression of GCLm might be explained by tissue-specific differences in the abundance of glutamate or in the regulation of GCLc (e.g. GCLc mRNA is stabilized by nerve growth factor during oxidative stress (26Pan Z. Perez-Polo R. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1996; 14: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)). A noteworthy feature of the physiology of poikilotherms, such as insects, is the existence of an inverse relationship between longevity and metabolic rate (14Sohal R.S. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Experimental regimens that lower the rate of oxygen consumption frequently extend the life span. Thus, in the present study, it was deemed necessary to rule out such an indirect mechanism for life-span extension by the overexpression of GCL. Additionally, oxygen consumption was measured in vials with dimensions similar to those used for life-span studies, to ensure comparable levels of physical activity during the experiments measuring life span and metabolic rate. GCLc overexpression driven by Appl-GAL4 or elav-GAL4 had no effect on the rate of oxygen consumption. This finding excludes a simple metabolic trade-off as the cause of the increase in longevity. Furthermore, the extension of life span was observed in long-lived genetic backgrounds (control life spans were 50–63 days for both the neuronal driver and UAS-GCLc control flies), which strengthens the conclusion that an increased GSH biosynthetic capacity in the CNS has a robust effect on aging. The present finding, that enhancement of the capacity for de novo GSH synthesis prolongs the life span of flies by up to 50%, has important ramifications for the oxidative stress hypothesis of aging. Although the validity of this hypothesis is not strictly dependent upon the relationship between antioxidant levels and longevity, an intuitive prediction is that bolstering antioxidant levels would increase longevity. Results of this study indicate that overexpression of GCLc in a long-lived background can extend the life span and increase resistance to oxidative stress, without affecting the metabolic rate. Notably, such benefit was observed only when tissues of the central nervous system exhibited an increased glutathione biosynthetic capability. This tissue-specific effect underscores the susceptibility of the nervous system to oxidative stress and strengthens the possibility that the spatially restricted overexpression of antioxidants could delay the aging process."
https://openalex.org/W1969097281,"Various members of the canonical family of transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) exhibit increased cation influx following receptor stimulation or Ca2+ store depletion. Tyrosine phosphorylation of TRP family members also results in increased channel activity; however, the link between the two events is unclear. We report that two tyrosine residues in the C terminus of human TRPC4 (hTRPC4), Tyr-959 and Tyr-972, are phosphorylated following epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor stimulation of COS-7 cells. This phosphorylation was mediated by Src family tyrosine kinases (STKs), with Fyn appearing to be the dominant kinase. In addition, EGF receptor stimulation induced the exocytotic insertion of hTRPC4 into the plasma membrane dependent on the activity of STKs and was accompanied by a phosphorylation-dependent increase in the association of hTRPC4 with Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor. Furthermore, this translocation and association was defective upon mutation of Tyr-959 and Tyr-972 to phenylalanine. Significantly, inhibition of STKs was concomitant with a reduction in Ca2+ influx in both native COS-7 cells and hTRPC4-expressing HEK293 cells, with cells expressing the Y959F/Y972F mutant exhibiting a reduced EGF response. These findings represent the first demonstration of a mechanism for phosphorylation to modulate TRPC channel function. Various members of the canonical family of transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) exhibit increased cation influx following receptor stimulation or Ca2+ store depletion. Tyrosine phosphorylation of TRP family members also results in increased channel activity; however, the link between the two events is unclear. We report that two tyrosine residues in the C terminus of human TRPC4 (hTRPC4), Tyr-959 and Tyr-972, are phosphorylated following epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor stimulation of COS-7 cells. This phosphorylation was mediated by Src family tyrosine kinases (STKs), with Fyn appearing to be the dominant kinase. In addition, EGF receptor stimulation induced the exocytotic insertion of hTRPC4 into the plasma membrane dependent on the activity of STKs and was accompanied by a phosphorylation-dependent increase in the association of hTRPC4 with Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor. Furthermore, this translocation and association was defective upon mutation of Tyr-959 and Tyr-972 to phenylalanine. Significantly, inhibition of STKs was concomitant with a reduction in Ca2+ influx in both native COS-7 cells and hTRPC4-expressing HEK293 cells, with cells expressing the Y959F/Y972F mutant exhibiting a reduced EGF response. These findings represent the first demonstration of a mechanism for phosphorylation to modulate TRPC channel function. The precise regulation of Ca2+ signaling is crucial to the function and survival of all cell types, with disrupted Ca2+ handling contributing to the pathogenesis of many diseases, including heart failure, ischemia, and neuronal degeneration (1Berridge M.J.

Control is maintained through complex interplays between plasma membrane proteins, the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Ca2+-binding proteins, and second messenger systems (4Berridge M.J.

A ubiquitous mechanism of Ca2+ entry is through the activation of non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels located in the plasma membrane. These channels respond to either receptor activation or intracellular Ca2+ store depletion to control events such as gene expression, secretion, and migration (6Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Roderick H.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R563-R565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).

Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The canonical or classic transient receptor potential ion channel sub-family (TRPC) is one of three TRP subfamilies known to mediate receptor-operated and store-operated Ca2+ entry (7Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The most compelling experimental evidence for a role of a TRPC protein in store-operated Ca2+ entry came from studies on the TRPC4 null mouse where TRPC4 was identified as an essential component of store-operated Ca2+ channels in aortic endothelial cells (8Freichel M. Suh S.H. Pfeifer A. Schweig U. Trost C. Weissgerber P. Biel M. Philipp S. Freise D. Droogmans G. Hofmann F. Flockerzi Nilius V. C, Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Evidence for a role of TRPC channels in receptor-operated Ca2+ entry include the finding that isolated endothelial cells from the TRPC4 knock-out mouse exhibited reduced Ca2+ entry in response to acetylcholine, ATP, and thrombin application, and antisense oligonucleotide down-regulation of TRPC4 reduced Ca2+ oscillations in response to carbachol application in HEK293 cells (8Freichel M.

Clearly, both store-operated and receptor-operated mechanisms can contribute to the activation of TRPC channels, in particular, TRPC4; however, the precise signaling components remain largely unknown. Recent findings suggest phosphorylation may be important in the control of TRP channel activation. Stimulation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) has also been shown to activate various members of the TRP family, including TRPC4, -5, and -6 (11Hisatsune C. Kuroda Y. Nakamura K. Inoue T. Nakamura T.

Indeed, a recent report demonstrated the involvement of TRPC4 in the activation of a store-operated current in corneal epithelial cells by EGF through an unknown mechanism (13Yang H. Mergler S.

Furthermore, an increase in diacylglycerol-stimulated single channel activity of TRPC6 was seen upon addition of the Src family tyrosine kinase (STK), Fyn (11Hisatsune C. Kuroda Y. Nakamura K.

STKs also appear important in the activation of TRPC3, TRPV4, and TRPM7 (14Jiang X. Newell E.W. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol.

The modulation of TRP channels by receptor tyrosine kinase activation suggests an important role for TRP members in regulating Ca2+ influx initiated by growth factor application. To date there have been no reports of phosphorylation occurring in the TRPC1/4/5 family, and the mechanisms of phosphorylation-induced modulation of TRP channel activity remain unknown. Another important mechanism in the regulation of TRP channels is modulation of membrane expression through the reversible translocation of subunits to the plasma membrane (18Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Li L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 19Boels K. Glassmeier G. Herrmann D. Riedel I.B. Hampe W. Kojima I. Schwarz J.R. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3599-3606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, TRPL was shown to undergo rapid membrane insertion following exposure of photoreceptors to light (20Bahner M. Frechter S. Da Silva N. Minke B. Paulsen R. Huber A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and TRPC6 was demonstrated to traffic to the cell surface upon G-protein-coupled receptor activation (21Cayouette S. Lussier M.P. Mathieu E.L. Bousquet S.M. Boulay G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7241-7246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The C-terminal PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1) motif of TRPC4 has been implicated in the control of channel surface expression and localization (22Mery L. Strauss B. Dufour J.F. Krause K.H. Hoth M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3497-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This motif is also responsible for mediating the interaction with the multi-PDZ domain-containing scaffolding protein Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor, NHERF (23Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Deletion of the PDZ motif (T-R-L) of hTRPC4 dramatically reduced the plasma membrane levels of the channel, which led the authors to suggest that the interaction between hTRPC4 and NHERF is required for the retention and stabilization of hTRPC4 channels at the cell membrane (22Mery L. Strauss B. Dufour J.F. Krause K.H. Hoth M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3497-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NHERF is also involved in regulating the cell surface expression levels of numerous other plasma membrane proteins, including the β-adrenergic receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (24Hildreth K.L. Wu J.H. Barak L.S. Exum S.T. Kim L.K. Peppel K. Freedman N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41775-41782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Voltz J.W. Weinman E.J. Shenolikar S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6309-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The activity of TRPC5 channels has also been shown to be influenced by interactions with NHERF (26Obukhov A.G. Nowycky M.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 201: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Dynamic regulation of the interaction between TRPC4 and NHERF may provide a mechanism for controlling TRPC4 surface expression and channel activation. The present study investigates the basis for EGFR-mediated Ca2+ entry through hTRPC4 channels. Evidence is presented that this key physiological activity results through Src family tyrosine kinase-mediated phosphorylation of hTRPC4 causing an increase in channel association with NHERF and a resultant increase in the plasma membrane expression of hTRPC4.

COS-7 and HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and routinely achieved between 35 and 60% transfection efficiency. For immunoprecipitation studies, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1.2 ml of RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein content was determined by BCA analysis (Pierce Biotechnology) and equal amounts of protein subjected to immunoprecipitation with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and 4 μg of antibody for 2 h at 4°C.

In Vitro Kinase Assay—HEK293 cells were transfected with pMET-Fyn-YF expression vector and lysed with RIPA buffer. Fyn-YF was precipitated with FYN3 antibody, washed two times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 10 μm ATP, with 0.25% Triton X-100), and immune complexes were incubated with equal quantities of purified GST fusion proteins in kinase buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Complexes were cleared by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—COS-7 cells transfected with YFP-hTRPC4 and HA-NHERF, were grown on glass coverslips, washed twice with PBS, then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS/5% sucrose and permeabilized with 50 μg/ml digitonin. Cells were blocked in 5% normal goat serum/5% normal horse serum for 45 min, then stained with anti-NHERF antibodies followed by anti-mouse biotin prior to development with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 594. Cells were mounted with Anti-Fade (Dako Cytomation) and observed under 63× oil-immersion objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M confocal microscope and analyzed with Zeiss LSM510. Intracellular Ca2+ Imaging—Cells were cultured on glass coverslips and loaded with 2-4 μm fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 30 min and incubated in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) for 30 min prior to stimulation. In experiments performed in Ca2+-free medium, cells were placed in HEPES-buffered saline without CaCl2 containing 200 μm EGTA. Fluorescence was recorded from coverslips mounted in 4.5-ml chambers, alternatively excited at 340 and 380 nm wavelengths and emission measured at 510 nm. Measurements were made using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrophotometer sampled every 1.4 s at 30 °C and analyzed with an FL Data Manager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored as 340/380 fluorescence ratio and converted to relative Ca2+ concentration using the formula of Grynkiewicz et al. (31Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), after establishment of daily Rmin and Rmax. Peak Ca2+ change was measured as the integral under the rise in [Ca2+]i above basal for the period of stimulation or Ca2+ re-addition. Single cell imaging was performed on transfected HEK293 cells illuminated with Lambda DG-4 lamp, captured with an Orca ER camera, and analyzed with the MetaFluor program (Universal Imaging Devices) using an objective with 40× magnification. All statistics were performed using Prism, one-way analysis of variance, and Tukey's post test. EGF Receptor Stimulation Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of hTRPC4—Activation of EGFR is known to induce both Ca2+ entry and store release with a number of TRPC channels, including TRPC4, -5, and -6 activated following EGF application. We sought to examine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of the TRPC member, hTRPC4, is involved in its activation. A recent report has questioned the specificity of commercially available TRPC4 antibodies (32Flockerzi V. Jung C. Aberle T. Meissner M. Freichel M. Philipp S.E. Nastainczyk W. Maurer P. Zimmermann R. Pflugers Arch. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, we first sought confirmation of the ability of the Alomone antibody to detect hTRPC4. An immunoblot was performed on whole cell lysates from control, FLAG-hTRPC4, and YFP-tagged FLAG-hTRPC4 transfected COS-7 cells to demonstrate the ability of the anti-TRPC4 antibody to recognize transfected hTRPC4 and endogenous TRPC4. As shown in Fig. 1A, the anti-TRPC4 antibody recognizes both endogenous TRPC4 and transfected hTRPC4. The endogenous product has a lower apparent molecular weight, possibly due to a species difference between the proteins or differential processing of the products in COS-7 cells. Interestingly, a variation in size between the endogenous and transfected proteins has also been reported for TRPC1 (33Ong H.L. Chen J. Chataway T. Brereton H. Zhang L. Downs T. Tsiokas L. Barritt G. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 641-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, neither the endogenous nor transfected protein were recognized by the antibody in the presence of immunizing peptide (data not shown) suggesting that the antibody is specific for the TRPC4 epitope. To address the role of phosphorylation in the activation of TRPC4 by EGF, serum-starved COS-7 cells transfected with FLAG-hTRPC4 were stimulated with EGF and assessed for tyrosine phosphorylation of hTRPC4 by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20). At 20 min post stimulation, a 5-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of hTRPC4 was observed (Fig. 1B); an effect also shown to occur with heterologously expressed hTRPC4 tagged with YFP (Fig. 1C). This shift in apparent molecular weight of the band recognized by the PY20 antibody to match the corresponding TRPC4 band upon addition of YFP suggests the species recognized by the PY20 antibody is the exogenously expressed immunoprecipitated TRPC4 protein in both FLAG and GFP precipitates and not a TRPC4-associated protein. Further, anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates failed to isolate any significant PY20 or TRPC4 reactive bands in the absence of expressed FLAG-TRPC4. To determine if endogenous hTRPC4 is phosphorylated, lysates from EGF stimulated A431 cells, which express both TRPC4 and large amounts of EGFR, were reacted with PY20 and precipitated proteins probed for the presence of TRPC4. In agreement with the results obtained with transfected hTRPC4, endogenous TRPC4 was phosphorylated upon EGFR stimulation (Fig. 1D), an effect that was prevented upon application of the specific EGFR inhibitor, AG1478 (10 nm) (Fig. 1D). Tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF stimulation was not common to all TRPC members, because GFP-hTRPC1, a closely related TRPC member, was not phosphorylated under similar conditions (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these data show that hTRPC4 is tyrosine phosphorylated following EGFR stimulation. Numerous proteins are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation following activation of both G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, including members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and STK-signaling cascades. Therefore, we sought to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of hTRPC4 was unique to EGFR activation. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were treated with a range of stimuli known to activate TRPC channels and initiate Ca2+ entry. G-protein receptor pathways were activated with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, carbachol, the PKC agonist oleoylacyl-sn-glycerol, and histamine. The effect of store depletion on hTRPC4 tyrosine phosphorylation was investigated using the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin. Cells were examined for activation of the classic G-protein and tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathway, Ras/Raf/MAPK by immunoblotting lysates for phosphorylated ERK1/2. The effect on global tyrosine phosphorylation was also studied by probing lysates with PY20. All stimuli used were shown to induce ERK activation and global tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1F), however only EGF induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of hTRPC4 (Fig. 1F). These data indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of hTRPC4 is unique to receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of hTRPC4 Is Mediated by Src Family Non-receptor Tyrosine Kinases—Src family tyrosine kinases, including Fyn and Lyn, are important downstream signaling intermediates of the EGF receptor and are implicated in the regulation of ion channels (34Carpenter G. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 35Burke P. Schooler K. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, their role in EGFR-induced hTRPC4 phosphorylation was investigated. COS-7 cells transfected with FLAG-hTRPC4 were stimulated with EGF in the presence of the specific STK-inhibitor, PP2 (5 μm), or an equivalent concentration of inactive analogue, PP3, and cell lysates examined for hTRPC4 tyrosine phosphorylation. When STK activity was inhibited, EGF failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of hTRPC4 (Fig. 2A), an effect not observed upon treatment with PP3 (Fig. 2A). Because the application of PP2 did not directly affect EGFR activation, as determined by phosphotyrosine levels of immunoprecipitated receptor (Fig. 2A), it was concluded that tyrosine phosphorylation of hTRPC4 following EGF receptor stimulation is mediated by Src family tyrosine kinases. Recent findings have implicated the STKs, Fyn and Lyn, in the regulation of TRPC channels. Therefore, their role in EGF-stimulated TRPC4 tyrosine phosphorylation was investigated. Either kinase-inactive Fyn (K299M, Fyn-KM), wild-type Fyn (Fyn-WT), or constitutively active Fyn (Y531F, Fyn-YF) was co-expressed with FLAG-hTRPC4 in COS-7 cells, and lysates were examined for hTRPC4 tyrosine phosphorylation. Co-expression of Fyn-WT or Fyn-YF with hTRPC4 enhanced the phosphorylation of the channel by ∼7- and 17-fold, respectively, in the absence of EGF (Fig. 2B). Fyn-KM had no effect on hTRPC4 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained when the experiments were repeated in HEK293 cells (data not shown), which express lower levels of EGFR than COS-7 cells. Further evidence for a role of Fyn in EGFR signaling and hTRPC4 tyrosine phosphorylation was gained by expressing either Fyn-KM or empty vector together with FLAG-hTRPC4 in EGF-stimulated COS-7 cells. In the presence Fyn-KM, EGF failed to increase hTRPC4 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Importantly, Fyn-KM expression did not affect EGFR activation as determined by tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the receptor (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that Fyn is a signaling intermediate between EGFR activation and hTRPC4 phosphorylation. The ability of Lyn co-expression to induce the phosphorylation of hTRPC4 was also assessed. Co-expression of constitutively active p53 and p56 Lyn (Lyn-YF) isoforms with FLAG-hTRPC4 in COS-7 cells elevated the tyrosine phosphorylation of hTRPC4 in the absence of EGF (Fig. 2D). However, in contrast to the results obtained with Fyn, wild-type isoforms of Lyn did not significantly increase basal hTRPC4 tyrosine phosphorylation, possibly due to lower transfection levels of Lyn (data not shown). Significantly, Lyn was found to co-precipitate with hTRPC4 from transfected cells, providing further evidence that Lyn also closely associates with hTRPC4 and is involved in the phosphorylation event (Fig. 2D). Co-expression of a kinase inactive form of Lyn (Lyn-ki, Y397F) did not significantly alter the EGF-induced phosphorylation of TRPC4 (Fig. 2E). This may indicate a preference for Fyn in the EGFR signaling pathway to hTRPC4. To further assess the interaction of STKs with TRPC4, a series of co-immunoprecipitations were performed from transfected COS-7 cells. Lysates from cells co-transfected with Fyn-WT and hTRPC4 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Fyn antibody or control rabbit immunoglobulin. Bound proteins were probed for the presence of phosphotyrosine (PY20), TRPC4 (FLAG), and Fyn. Only Fyn precipitates contained TRPC4 and a corresponding PY20 band (Fig. 3A). To assess the potential involvement of Src in hTRPC4 phosphorylation, EGF-stimulated FLAG-hTRPC4-transfected COS-7 cells were immunoprecipitate"

The potential of a dramatically reduced amino acid alphabet to produce an active catalyst supports the notion that primordial enzymes may have possessed low amino acid diversity and suggests that combinatorial engineering strategies, such as the one used here, may be generally applied to create enzymes with novel structures and functions. Natural evolution produces complex protein folds with a 20-amino acid alphabet. Primordial protein synthesis, however, is believed to have involved only a handful of amino acids (1Davis B.K. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2002; 79: 77-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). What is the minimal number of building blocks required for protein structure and function? Several studies have demonstrated that considerably reduced amino acid alphabets are sufficient to encode native-like proteins (2Regan L. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1988; 241: 976-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 3Kamtekar S. Schiffer J.M. Xiong H. Babik J.M. Hecht M.H.

Biol. 1997; 4: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For instance, a de novo designed protein constructed from a 7-amino acid alphabet adopts a well defined four-helix bundle fold (5Schafmeister C.E. LaPorte S.L. Miercke L.J.W. Stroud R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, such simplified proteins are generally devoid of function. Simplifying existing proteins without impairing their normal function is challenging, too, given the precise identity and positioning of residues required for binding and catalysis. Selection strategies in combination with design have been successfully applied to search sequence space for active proteins (6Riddle D.S. Santiago J.V. Bray-Hall S.T. Doshi N. Grantcharova V.P. Yi Q. Baker D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 7Silverman J.A. Balakrishnan R. Harbury P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, phage display has been exploited to obtain functional SH3 domain variants in which 70% of the wild-type sequence was replaced with a five-letter amino acid alphabet while retaining key binding site residues (6Riddle D.S. Santiago J.V. Bray-Hall S.T. Doshi N. Grantcharova V.P. Yi Q. Baker D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we exploited selection in vivo to replace all secondary structure units in an AroQ chorismate mutase (CM) 2The abbreviations used are: CMchorismate mutaseANS1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonateEcCME. coli CMMjCMM. jannashii CM with simple binary-patterned modules of 4 polar and 4 apolar residues (9Taylor S.V.

However, the total number of amino acid types present in the resulting CMs was 14 since the highly conserved active site amino acids and the loop residues were held constant in the original design. Here, we have extended this work and shown that fully functional proteins can be constructed entirely from a 9-amino acid set. These represent the most severely simplified enzymes reported to date. chorismate mutase 1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonate E. coli CM M. jannashii CM Reagents—Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA ligase was from Fermentas. Pfu Turbo polymerase was from Stratagene. Protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as the calibration standard. Library Construction—Libraries were constructed by combinatorial site-directed mutagenesis. N- and C-terminal fragments were amplified from plasmid pKT-λ3 containing the parent CM gene (9Taylor S.V. Walter K.U. Kast P. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10596-10601Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using outside primers sspREX03 (21 bp, 5′-CATCCGGCTCGTATAATGTGT-3′) and TMUTN (19 bp, 5′-ATCAAGCGGCCGCACTAGT-3′) in combination with an overlapping mutagenic oligonucleotide pair for each library: 01KW9RQX (21 bp, 5′-ACAAAATGATCRAMAAAGAAA-3′)/02KW9RQX (20 bp, 5′-AGCATTTCTTTKTYGATCAT-3′) for the Gln88Xaa library (Xaa: Glu, Asn, Asp); 01KW9L2X (36 bp, 5′-CTTCAAGGAGRASAACWTSGACGAAGACCTCTTCAT-3′)/02KW9L2X (36 bp, 5′-GAGGTCTTCGTCSAWGTTSTYCTCCTTGAAGAACTT-3′) for the L2 library; and 01KW9L1X4 (57 bp, 5′-CTTCAAACTCAAGAAAGAACTGDWSDWSDWSDWSAACGACTTCGACCGTGAAGAGTT-3′)/02KW9L1X4 (56 bp, 5′-AACTCTTCACGGTCGAAGTCGTTSWHSWHSWHSWHCAGTTCTTTCTTGAGTTTGAA-3′) for the L1 library, where R = A, G; M = A, C; K = G, T; Y = C, T; S = C, G; W = A, T; D = A, G, T and H = A, C, T. Randomized codons are underlined. All oligonucleotides were obtained from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. To obtain full-length genes, complementary fragment pairs were annealed and extended in a second PCR using the outside primers sspREX03 and TMUTN. Genes were treated with restriction enzymes (NdeI//XhoI), purified, and ligated with the 2800-bp NdeI/XhoI fragment of vector pKT-λ3 (9Taylor S.V. Walter K.U. Kast P. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10596-10601Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The L1 library was constructed from the active members of the L2 library, which was constructed in turn from the Gln88Xaa library. Final constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Selection—Library plasmid pools were transformed into the KA12/pKIMP-UAUC selection strain with efficiencies greater than 106 clones/μg of library DNA (10Kast P. Asif-Ullah M. Jiang N. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were washed in minimal medium and plated onto M9c minimal medium plates (lacking Tyr and Phe). Plates were typically incubated for 3 days at 30 °C or 6 days at 25 °C. Protein Production and Purification—The gene encoding the simplified 9-amino acid CM was subcloned as a 282-bp NdeI/XhoI fragment into the T7 promoter-based expression vector pET-22b-pATCH, which appends a His6 tag at the C terminus, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain KA13 (11MacBeath G. Kast P. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Expression from the T7 promotor was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) followed by preparative fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superdex 75 (26/60) gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). MjCM was produced as described previously (12MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Protein integrity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Kinetic Assays—CM activity measurements were performed at 20 °C in acetate buffer (pH 5) as reported previously (12MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The inhibition assay was carried out under the same conditions in the presence of a transition state analog (compound 1, 0–100 μm) (13Bartlett P.A. Johnson C.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 7792-7793Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). ANS Fluorescence—Fluorescence measurements were performed in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 5) at 20 °C using an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. The concentrations of 1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonate (ANS), enzyme, and transition state analog were 2, 2, and 20–600 μm, respectively. H/D Exchange—H/D exchange experiments were performed as described previously (14Vamvaca K. Vögeli B. Kast P. Pervushin K. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12860-12864Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The number of protected labile H atoms was calculated by subtracting the observed mass from the mass of the fully deuterated protein. CD Spectroscopy—Thermal unfolding curves of a 16 μm protein solution (in the presence and absence of 320 μm inhibitor) were monitored by CD at 222 nm, increasing the temperature from 10 to 95 °C in 1 °C steps. CMs catalyze the rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate and are essential for the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids Tyr and Phe in bacteria, fungi, and plants. The binary patterned mutase that served as our starting point is a domain-swapped homodimer (9Taylor S.V. Walter K.U. Kast P. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10596-10601Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); each subunit is composed of three helices (H1, H2, and H3) connected by two loops (L1 and L2) (Fig. 1A). With the exception of a glutamine (Gln88) and three arginines (Arg11, Arg28, Arg51) in the active site and 4 loop residues (Gly43, Pro45, His66, Val68), all its building blocks belong to the eight-letter alphabet: Asp, Glu, Asn, Lys/Phe, Ile, Leu, Met (Fig. 2A). Arginine residues are invariant constituents in the active sites of AroQ CMs (12MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Lee A.Y. Karplus P.A. Ganem B. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3627-3628Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) and could not be replaced, but the other noncanonical catalytic and loop residues were systematically substituted to produce 9-amino acid enzymes.FIGURE 2Strategy for engineering simplified CMs. A, amino acid sequences of the binary patterned parent protein (14 building blocks) and simplified variants (13, 11, and 9 building blocks). Polar and apolar residues are shown in red and blue, respectively. Residues that do not belong to the 8-amino acid alphabet (black) were replaced by selection in three steps. Arginine residues were held constant. B, in vivo complementation. The ability of the minimized enzyme to complement the CM deficiency of KA12/pKIMP-UAUC cells (10Kast P. Asif-Ullah M. Jiang N. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was evaluated by streaking clones on minimal medium (M9c) in the absence (left) and presence (right) of Tyr and Phe. Cells bearing the simplified protein without (i) and with (ii) a His6 tag grow similarly. Cells containing wild-type EcCM (iii) and MjCM (iv) or the vector (v) are included as positive and negative controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) First, the active site glutamine (Gln88) was replaced by the set of 4 polar amino acids using site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting library was introduced into the auxotrophic E. coli strain KA12/pKIMP-UAUC (10Kast P. Asif-Ullah M. Jiang N. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and subjected to in vivo selection. Three of the four protein variants complemented the CM deficiency of host cells under selective conditions (Supplemental Table 1), although the growth rates differed significantly (Glu > Asn > Asp). The size and charge of the amino acid side chain seems to play an important role at this position. Second, we replaced His66 and Val68 in loop L2 of the active Gln88Xaa mutants with the polar and apolar amino acid subsets, respectively. Of the 48 possible combinations introduced by combinatorial mutagenesis, only 4 yielded active enzymes (Supplemental Table 1). Third, 2 residues in loop L1 (Gly43 and Pro45) in the complementing L2 variants were replaced with either the polar or the apolar set of amino acids or with both sets simultaneously. However, no complementing clones were observed after 20 days at 25 °C. Consequently, all 4 L1 loop residues (Gly43-Ile44-Pro45-Ile46) were simultaneously randomized. Because the nature of the genetic code did not allow assignment of a single degenerate codon encoding the simplified 9-amino acid alphabet (Asp, Glu, Asn, Lys/Phe, Ile, Leu, Met plus Arg), a new degenerate codon DWS (D = A, G, T; W = A, T; S = C, G) was employed to construct a library encoding all 9 design residues plus Val, Tyr, and the amber stop codon (UAG). Based on the experimental transformation efficiencies, >95% of the 58,564 possible variants were evaluated in the selection system (16Firth A.E. Patrick W.M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 3314-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); only five complemented the CM deficiency. All active clones contain Asp45, aliphatic residues at positions 44 and 46, and polar residues at position 43 (Supplemental Table 1); neither Val nor Tyr was found in any functional sequence. Despite dramatic simplification relative to natural mutases, the selected 9-amino acid enzymes are fully functional in vivo, replacing wild-type CM in bacterial metabolism (Fig. 2B). Bacterial cells encoding the simplified catalysts grew only somewhat slower than those with wild-type enzymes from E. coli (EcCM) and Methanococcus jannashii (MjCM), presumably due to the Q88E active site mutation. In natural AroQ CMs, Gln88 serves to stabilize the transition state during catalysis, acting as a hydrogen bond donor (15Lee A.Y. Karplus P.A. Ganem B. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3627-3628Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and replacing this residue with glutamic acid shifts the pH optimum to approximately pH 5 (17Zhang S. Kongsaeree P. Clardy J. Wilson D.B. Ganem B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996; 4: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions (pH 7), glutamic acid should be largely deprotonated, which would be deleterious for substrate binding and catalysis (Fig. 1B). One of the simplified CM variants displaying high activity in vivo (Fig. 2A) was overproduced for detailed characterization. A His6 tag was attached at its C terminus to facilitate purification. The addition of this tag does not alter the behavior of the protein in vivo (Fig. 2B). The overproduced enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid) and gel filtration, typically yielding 6 mg of soluble protein/liter of liquid culture. Although the activity of the wild type remains constant over a broad pH range (pH 5–9) (12MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the simplified enzyme displays optimal activity at pH 5 as a result of the Q88E mutation (Fig. 1B, Supplemental Fig. 1). Under these conditions, its kcat value (0.9 s-1) is only 3-fold lower than that of MjCM (3.1 s-1), whereas its Km value (830 μm) is 40-fold higher than that of the wild type (20 μm). In line with its lower specific activity, the simplified CM binds the transition state analog inhibitor (compound 1, Fig. 1B) 50-fold less tightly (Ki = 10 μm) than the wild-type enzyme (Ki = 0.21 μm). The simplified enzyme is highly helical as judged by far UV CD spectroscopy (Supplemental Fig. 2A) and elutes as a dimer from a size-exclusion chromatography column (Supplemental Fig. 2B) like typical AroQ mutases (12MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Its 1H-NMR spectrum exhibits similar peak dispersion to wild-type MjCM (Supplemental Fig. 3, A and B) but generally contains fewer peaks due to the reduced amino acid diversity. The addition of the transition state analog inhibitor causes only a slight increase in NMR peak dispersion (Supplemental Fig. 3, C and D) and in helical content of the enzyme (Supplemental Fig. 2A). However, some of the biophysical properties differ somewhat from wild-type CMs. For instance, the minimized mutase undergoes slightly faster H/D exchange than its natural counterpart (Fig. 3A). An additional 10–14 backbone amides (out of ∼100) appear to exchange more rapidly in the simplified enzyme, suggesting greater fraying of its helices (18Smith D.L. Deng Y. Zhang Z. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Addition of the transition state analog tightens both structures to a similar extent (≈3–5%) (14Vamvaca K. Vögeli B. Kast P. Pervushin K. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12860-12864Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Chemical denaturation studies showed that the minimized protein is less stable (ΔGU (H2O) = 9.5 kcal mol-1) than MjCM (ΔGU (H2O) = 24.0 kcal mol-1) (12MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Its thermal unfolding is reversible but noncooperative, although the addition of inhibitor induces modest cooperativity (Tm = 55 °C) (Fig. 3B). For comparison, the wild type unfolds with a high degree of cooperativity, even in the absence of ligand (Tm = 88 °C) (12MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Finally, the protein binds the hydrophobic dye ANS (19Stryer L. Science. 1968; 162: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) to a greater extent than MjCM, leading to enhancement of fluorescence and a blue shift of the emission maximum (Fig. 3C). Addition of the transition state analog impairs ANS binding, probably by tightening the packing of the hydrophobic core. The fact that less than half of the proteinogenic amino acids are sufficient to construct a chorismate mutase that is metabolically competent, conferring near wild-type levels of cell growth to an auxotrophic host, supports the hypothesis that primitive enzymes may have contained a reduced set of building blocks (1Davis B.K. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2002; 79: 77-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, dispensing with 11 of the 20 standard amino acids significantly reduces the diversity of favorable internal packing interactions, leading to destabilization of the overall protein structure. As a consequence, the simplified enzyme displays certain properties (noncooperative thermal unfolding, ANS binding) reminiscent of the molten globule state (20Ptitsyn O.B. Pain R.H. Semisotnov G.V. Zerovnik E. Razgulyaev O.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 21Betz S.F. Raleigh D.P. DeGrado W.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 601-610Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it appears to be less molten than a previously engineered CM monomer (14Vamvaca K. Vögeli B. Kast P. Pervushin K. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12860-12864Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Science. 1998; 279: 1958-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), probably due to additional stabilizing interactions in the hydrophobic region located between its two active sites. In terms of enzyme evolution, these two proteins can be viewed as models for primitive catalysts in that both are less complex than a modern day enzyme such as MjCM with respect to primary sequence or quaternary structure. The reduced amino acid alphabet we used to create the minimized enzyme was arbitrarily chosen to suit a design strategy based on two degenerate codons each encoding a set of 4 polar and 4 apolar residues. Notably, neither small (Ala, Cys, Gly), hydroxylated (Ser, Thr), nor sterically constrained (Pro) residues are required to obtain an active helical bundle structure, although they occur frequently in AroQ CMs (12MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Some of these residues (especially Ala and Gly) have been generally considered indispensable building blocks for the formation of helices and turns in severely simplified proteins (23Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties, 2nd Ed..W. H. Freeman, New York. 1993; : 171-260Google Scholar, 24Wang J. Wang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Given the restriction (no small amino acids) and redundancy (Asp/Glu and Ile/Leu) of the 9-amino acid alphabet, more extensive simplification of the mutase may well be feasible. The CM selection system, like selection systems more generally (25Taylor S.V. Kast P. Hilvert D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 40: 3311-3335Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar), is ideally suited to explore alternative amino acid alphabets to identify the best minimal set, as well as to pinpoint residues that are critical for folding and function by re-expanding these alphabets via additional rounds of directed evolution. The optimal building blocks for producing active α-helical and β-sheet proteins are unlikely to be the same, and analogous experiments on structurally distinct CMs, which include all-α-helical (15Lee A.Y. Karplus P.A. Ganem B. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3627-3628Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar), pseudo-α/β-barrel (26Chook Y.M. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8600-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and all-β-sheet architectures (27Haynes M.R. Stura E.A. Hilvert D. Wilson I.A. Science. 1994; 263: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), promise valuable insights into the unique structural requirements of different scaffolds. In this context, recent advances in computation, which have made possible the design of novel proteins with atomic level accuracy (28Dahiyat B.I. Mayo S.L. Science. 1997; 278: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 29Kuhlman B. Dantas G. Ireton G.C. Varani G. Stoddard B.L. Baker D. Science. 2003; 302: 1364-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar, 30Harbury P.B. Plecs J.J. Tidor B. Alber T. Kim P.S. Science. 1998; 282: 1462-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) as well as the redesign of natural proteins to create novel binding (31Looger L.L. Dwyer M.A. Smith J.J. Hellinga H.W. Nature. 2003; : 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) or catalytic sites (32Dwyer M.A. Looger L.L. Hellinga H.W. Science. 2004; 304: 1967-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), can be expected to reinforce experimental efforts to identify viable alternative alphabets for specific folds. In turn, simplified alphabets may facilitate computational searching by reducing the number of sequences that need to be sampled and should bring us closer to the still unrealized goal of designing new enzymes from scratch.

https://openalex.org/W2086250032,"FXYD5 (related to ion channel, dysadherin) is a member of the FXYD family of single span type I membrane proteins. Five members of this group have been shown to interact with the Na,K-ATPase and to modulate its properties. However, FXYD5 is structurally different from other family members and has been suggested to play a role in regulating E-cadherin and promoting metastasis (Ino, Y., Gotoh, M., Sakamoto, M., Tsukagoshi, K., and Hirohashi, S. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 365–370). The goal of this study was to determine whether FXYD5 can modulate the Na,K-ATPase activity, establish its cellular and tissue distribution, and characterize its biochemical properties. Anti-FXYD5 antibodies detected a 24-kDa polypeptide that was preferentially expressed in kidney, intestine, spleen, and lung. In kidney, FXYD5 resides in the basolateral membrane of the connecting tubule, the collecting tubule, and the intercalated cells of the collecting duct. However, there is also labeling of the apical membrane in long thin limb of Henle's loop. FXYD5 was effectively immunoprecipitated by antibodies to the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase and the anti-FXYD5 antibody immunoprecipitates α. Co-expressing FXYD5 with the α1 and β1 subunits of the Na,K-ATPase in Xenopus oocytes elicited a more than 2-fold increase in pump activity, measured either as ouabain-blockable outward current or as ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake. Thus, as found with other FXYD proteins, FXYD5 interacts with the Na,K-ATPase and modulates its properties. FXYD5 (related to ion channel, dysadherin) is a member of the FXYD family of single span type I membrane proteins. Five members of this group have been shown to interact with the Na,K-ATPase and to modulate its properties. However, FXYD5 is structurally different from other family members and has been suggested to play a role in regulating E-cadherin and promoting metastasis (Ino, Y., Gotoh, M., Sakamoto, M., Tsukagoshi, K., and Hirohashi, S. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 365–370). The goal of this study was to determine whether FXYD5 can modulate the Na,K-ATPase activity, establish its cellular and tissue distribution, and characterize its biochemical properties. Anti-FXYD5 antibodies detected a 24-kDa polypeptide that was preferentially expressed in kidney, intestine, spleen, and lung. In kidney, FXYD5 resides in the basolateral membrane of the connecting tubule, the collecting tubule, and the intercalated cells of the collecting duct. However, there is also labeling of the apical membrane in long thin limb of Henle's loop. FXYD5 was effectively immunoprecipitated by antibodies to the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase and the anti-FXYD5 antibody immunoprecipitates α. Co-expressing FXYD5 with the α1 and β1 subunits of the Na,K-ATPase in Xenopus oocytes elicited a more than 2-fold increase in pump activity, measured either as ouabain-blockable outward current or as ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake. Thus, as found with other FXYD proteins, FXYD5 interacts with the Na,K-ATPase and modulates its properties. Work in several laboratories led to the identification of a family of proteins, named after the common motif FXYD (1Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Five members of this group have been shown to interact with the Na,K-ATPase and elicit different effects on its kinetics.

The remaining two family members FXYD5 (related to ion channel, dysadherin) and FXYD6 have not yet been analyzed for possible interactions with the Na,K-ATPase. The working hypothesis is that all family members modulate the pump kinetics in vivo and function as tissue-specific modulators of the Na,K-ATPase (9Crambert G. Geering K. Sci.

However, other functions for FXYD proteins have also been suggested (12Ahlers B.A. Zhang X.Q. Moorman J.R. Rothblum L.I. Carl L.L. Song J. Wang J. Geddis L.M. Tucker A.L. Mounsey J.P. Cheung J.Y. J.

With the exception of FXYD5, the extracellular domain is shorter than 40 amino acids, including a cleavable signal peptide. In the case of FXYD5, the extracellular domain is long, >140 amino acids. On the other hand, FXYD5 has the shortest intracellular C-terminal segment of only 15 amino acids. FXYD5 has been cloned as a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated gene induced by the oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1 and termed “related to ion channel” (17Fu X. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Independently, human FXYD5 was identified as a cancer-associated cell membrane protein, which down-regulates E-cadherin and promotes metastasis, and was termed dysadherin (14Ino Y. Gotoh M. Sakamoto M. Tsukagoshi K. Hirohashi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). 4Dysadherin cloned from human cDNA shares only 59% homology with FXYD5 cloned from mouse cDNA and is characterized in the present study. Because public data bases do not predict another human protein with higher homology to mouse FXYD5, dysadherin is assumed to be the human ortholog. Dysadherin has been reported to be expressed in the plasma membrane of several types of carcinoma cells but not in nontumor cells (18Aoki S. Shimamura T. Shibata T. Nakanishi Y. Moriya Y. Sato Y.

The apparent molecular mass of the protein detected in these studies is 50–55 kDa, much higher than its calculated molecular mass (<20 kDa). This observation has been suggested to reflect an extensive O-glycosylation (14Ino Y. Gotoh M. Sakamoto M. Tsukagoshi K. Hirohashi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 21Tsuiji H. Takasaki S. Sakamoto M. Irimura T. Hirohashi S. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This study reports the functional expression, some biochemical characterization, and the tissue and cellular distribution of FXYD5. Experiments utilizing specific antibodies demonstrate that FXYD5 can be found in normal cells and that it is particularly abundant in epithelial cells in kidney, intestine, and lung. Co-immunoprecipitation assays show that FXYD5 specifically interacts with the α subunit of Na, K-ATPase, and functional assays demonstrate effects on the pump kinetics. Thus, as found for other FXYD proteins, FXYD5 is a tissue-specific modulator of the Na,K-ATPase. Part of these data have been reported in abstract form (22Lubarski I. Pihakaski-Maunsbach K. Karlish S.J.D. Maunsbach A.B. Garty H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 51Google Scholar). cDNA Clones—A mouse FXYD5 EST clone (accession number W98807) was sequenced from both ends. It contains the whole open reading frame, and its deduced amino acid sequence is identical to those previously reported (1Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 17Fu X. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Hemagglutinin A (HA)-tagged constructs (HA-FXYD5) were prepared either by replacing amino acids 2–18 (the putative signal peptide) with an HA epitope or by inserting the HA epitope before the signal peptide (between the first and second amino acid). For expression in Escherichia coli, the FXYD5 coding region lacking the signal peptide was cloned into pGEX-4T1vector downstream and in-frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST). For expression in Xenopus oocytes, FXYD5, HA-FXYD5, rat α1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, and pig β1 subunit of the enzyme were subcloned between 5′ and 3′ sequences of Xenopus β-globin in pGEM or pBluescript-derived vectors (23Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-FXYD5 antibodies have been raised against two peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through N-terminal cysteines. One is CRQLSQFCLNRHR corresponding to the last 13 amino acids at the intracellular C terminus. The other is CEATGSQTAAQT corresponding to amino acids 65–75 in the extracellular N-terminal segment. For immunocytochemistry, we have used antibodies that were purified by affinity chromatography using the immunizing peptides coupled to the HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal antibodies to the C-terminal sequences of CHIF and γ were described previously (24Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J.D. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody to a sequence near the N terminus of the α1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase (6H) was kindly provided by Dr. M. J. Caplan, Yale University School of Medicine. A polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal sequence KETTY of the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase was obtained from Dr. J. Kyte, University of California, San Diego. A monoclonal anti-HA antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Intercalated cells were identified by a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of the 56-kDa subunit of vacuolar H-ATPase. 5B. M. Christensen et al., manuscript in preparation. Tissue and Cell Fractionation and Immunoblotting—Mice (ICR) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and various organs were excised and rinsed in ice-cold HSE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 25 mm histidine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml pepstatin A)). Tissue was homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica Switzerland, four times with 6-s pulses at setting 10). Tissue homogenates were sedimented for 15 min at 4000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were further centrifuged for 90 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants (cytosols) were saved, and the pellets (membranes) were suspended in HSE buffer + protease inhibitors. Protein content was determined by the method of Lowry. FXYD5 was found to be very sensitive to proteolytic digestion, especially from intestinal membranes. Therefore, it was important to re-add protease inhibitors to the membrane resuspension medium. Xenopus oocytes were injected with 3 ng of cRNA encoding FXYD5 or HA-FXYD5. Three days later, oocytes were gently homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors mixture (1 mm PMSF, 20 mg/ml leupeptin, and 20 mg/ml pepstatin A). The suspension was centrifuged through a 20% sucrose cushion, and the supernatant (cytosol) was collected. The pellet was then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 20 mg/ml leupeptin, 20 mg/ml pepstatin A), and 100 mm iodoacetamide. The sample was centrifuged to separate the solubilized membrane proteins from the insoluble yolk and pigment. For Western blotting, cytosolic and membrane protein samples were suspended in SDS sample buffer and resolved on 10 or 7.5% Tricine gels. Proteins were transferred by semi-dry blotting onto PVDF membranes in CAPS buffer plus 10% methanol at 13 V for 90 min. The blots were blocked in 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FXYD5 (1:500), anti-CHIF (1:500), anti-γ (1:1000), anti-α (1:1000), or anti-HA (1:1000). Protein bands were visualized by ECL using horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (1 h at room temperature, 1:5000). Co-immunoprecipitation of FXYD5 and Na,K-ATPase—Membranes were first suspended and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, with and without 10 mm RbCl + 5 mm ouabain. The suspension was then chilled to 0 °C, and C12E10 was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The detergent-solubilized membranes were centrifuged for 30 min at 50,000 × g; the supernatant collected, and RbCl was added to a final concentration of 100 mm. No significant amount of FXYD5 was detected in the pellet, indicating full solubilization in 1 mg/ml C12E10. For co-immunoprecipitation, aliquots of the supernatant were rotated at 4 °C either overnight with 6H antibody covalently linked to protein A-Sepharose beads or for 4 h with purified anti-FXYD5 antibody and then overnight with protein A beads. Beads were sedimented for 5 min at 10,000 × g and washed three times in solubilization buffer containing 1 mg/ml C12E10, 25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, with and without 100 mm RbCl + 5 mm ouabain. They were resuspended in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2, for cross-linked 6H antibody or in SDS sample buffer for anti-FXYD5, and centrifuged (1 min at 3000 × g). The supernatants and an aliquot of the total detergent-solubilized membranes were dissolved in SDS sample buffer, resolved on Tricine gel, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was cut to high, medium, and low molecular weight regions that were probed with antibodies to α,FXYD5, and CHIF or γ, respectively. Na,K-ATPase Activity Measurements—Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50-nl aliquots containing 3 ng of rat α1 cRNA, 3 ng of pig β1 cRNA, and either 3 ng of FXYD5 cRNA or diluent. The pump activity was measured 3 days later either by recording ouabain-blockable and K+-induced outward currents (25Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or by measuring ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake (26Jaunin P. Horisberger J.D. Richter K. Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases measurements were done in the presence of 10 μm ouabain, which fully blocks the endogenous Xenopus pump activity but not the expressed Na,K-ATPase. Oocytes were first loaded with Na+-free medium composed of the following: 80 mm sodium gluconate, 0.82 mm MgCl2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 10 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine/HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm BaCl2, and 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride. For current measurements, oocytes were suspended in a Na+ for 2 h in a K+-free medium containing 140 mm sucrose + 10 μm ouabain instead of sodium gluconate. Currents were recorded at a holding potential of -50 mV before and after the addition of 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 5 mm potassium gluconate. As a final step, 2 mm ouabain was added, and the ouabain-inhibited currents were recorded. For 86Rb+ uptake measurements, Na+-loaded oocytes were divided into two groups of 7–8 oocytes and incubated for an additional 15 min at 25 °C in a solution containing 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm BaCl2,10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and either 10 μm or 2 mm ouabain. 86Rb+ uptake was then initiated by the addition of 5 mm KCl + 5 μCi/ml 86RbCl. The uptake was stopped 12 min later by a 15-fold dilution and five washings in an ice-cold incubation solution containing 5 mm nonradioactive RbCl. Oocytes were then counted individually for 86Rb+ content. Immunofluorescence Microscopy of Mouse Tissue—For confocal microscopy mouse kidneys were fixed for 4 h at 4°C in 4% periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde, pH 6.2. They were embedded in paraffin blocks, and 2-μm sections were cut with a microtome. De-paraffinized sections were preincubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% skim milk, 0.05% saponin, and 0.2% fish gelatin. They were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with either purified polyclonal anti-FXYD5 antibody (1:50), a monoclonal anti-α antibody (6H, 1:100), or a biotinylated polyclonal antibody raise against the 56-kDa subunit of the vacuolar H-ATPase (1:300). The primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (green) or with goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 (red). Anti-H-ATPase was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled streptavidin (1:200; green). For double labeling of FXYD5 and α, the labeling and detection were done with mixtures of antibodies. In double labeling for H-ATPase and FXYD5, the FXYD5 antibody was detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 (red). The labeled antibodies were observed with a Leica TCS SL confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany). Electron Microscopy—For immunoelectron microscopy, mouse kidneys were fixed for 4 h at 4 °Cin4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. Small tissue blocks were trimmed from the immersion-fixed kidneys from all kidney zones, cryo-protected with 2.3 m sucrose, mounted on holders, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunoelectron microscopy was performed on cryosections prepared with a Leica Reichert Ultracut S cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica, Vienna, Austria). The ultrathin cryosections were first preincubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mm glycine and 1% bovine serum albumin or 0.1% skim milk powder. Antigen retrieval was carried out with Tris/EGTA buffer, pH 9.0, for 60 min at 60 °C. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-N FXYD5 antibodies (1:50) and were visualized with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10 nm colloidal gold particles (GAR.EM1O, BioCell Research Laboratories, Cardiff, UK) diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% skim milk powder and 5 mg/ml polyethylene glycol. The sections were stained with 0.3% uranyl acetate in 1.8% methylcellulose for 10 min before examination in an FEI Morgagni 208 electron microscope. The following immunolabeling controls were used: 1) substitution of the primary antibody with nonimmune rabbit IgG; 2) preincubation of the antibodies with FXYD5 peptide (∼50-fold molar excess); and 3) incubation without the use of primary antibody. All controls showed absence of labeling. Two rabbit polyclonal antibodies have been raised against the C- and N-terminal peptides of FXYD5 and are termed anti-C and anti-N, respectively. In order to verify that the antibodies react specifically with FXYD5, we have tested them on Xenopus oocytes injected with FXYD5 and HA-FXYD5 cRNAs. The anti-C antibody recognized an ∼24-kDa polypeptide present in oocytes injected with FXYD5 or HA-FXYD5 cRNA but not in noninjected oocytes (Fig. 1A). In oocytes injected with HA-FXYD5, a similar 24-kDa polypeptide was detected by the anti-HA and anti-C antibodies. A 24-kDa protein was recognized by the anti-C antibody also in kidney microsomes (Fig. 1B) as well as other tissue (see below). On the other hand, the anti-N antibody gave no signal in oocytes membranes (not shown) and faintly labeled a 24-kDa protein in kidney microsomes (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we concluded that both antibodies interact specifically with FXYD5, which migrates as a 24-kDa protein, but the anti-C antibody is more suitable for Western blot characterization. The anti-N antibody did, however, give better signals in staining tissue slices for FXYD5 using confocal and electron microscopy (see below). FXYD5 has two hydrophobic regions of ∼20 amino acids, suggested to be a signal peptide and transmembrane domain, respectively. Signal peptide prediction, done according to Ref. 27Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4933) Google Scholar, indicates that the initial hydrophobic sequence is indeed likely to be a cleavable signal peptide, with a cleavage site between amino acids 21 and 22. The HA-FXYD5 protein detected in Fig. 1A lacks the putative signal peptide and has instead nine amino acids corresponding to the HA epitope. The fact that this protein runs somewhat higher in the gel than the one expressed by unmodified FXYD5 cRNA (the two rightmost lanes in Fig. 1A) indicates that the signal peptide is indeed cleaved in the native protein. Also, modification of the N terminus seemed to impair trafficking of the protein to the plasma membrane, because HA-FXYD5 was recovered in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions, whereas FXYD5 was detected only in membranes (Fig. 1A). In order to examine this issue further, we studied expression of a construct in which the HA epitope was inserted upstream of the signal peptide, between the first and second amino acids. The protein expressed by this construct was well recognized by the anti-C antibody but not by the anti HA antibody, confirming cleavage of the signal peptide (Fig. 1C). The molecular weight of FXYD5 detected in Xenopus oocytes and native tissue was significantly higher than the value calculated from the sequence (19.4 and 17.2 kDa with and without the signal peptide, respectively). This discrepancy may reflect abnormal electrophoretic mobility or glycosylation of the matured protein. However, the mobility of FXYD5 was not affected by treatment with peptide N-glycosidase or O-glycosidase (data not shown), suggesting that an abnormal electrophoretic mobility is the more likely possibility. The mobility of recombinant protein formed between GST and FXYD5 also appears abnormal because it migrated as a 50-kDa polypeptide, even though its calculated molecular mass is 44 kDa (data not shown). This fusion protein was expressed in E. coli, so it cannot be glycosylated. The 24-kDa protein detected in this study appears to be quite different in size from the 50–55-kDa glycoprotein reported to correspond to the human ortholog, dysadherin, and was suggested to be extensively O-glycosylated (14Ino Y. Gotoh M. Sakamoto M. Tsukagoshi K. Hirohashi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 21Tsuiji H. Takasaki S. Sakamoto M. Irimura T. Hirohashi S. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed below. The anti-C antibody has been used to study the tissue distribution of FXYD5 by Western blotting. FXYD5 was particularly abundant in intestine, spleen, lung, and kidney but not in brain, liver, muscle, and heart (Fig. 2A). The >40-kDa polypeptide detected in brain was seen also with preimmune serum and hence is likely to be an unrelated protein. The segmental distribution of FXYD5 in the kidney and intestine is illustrated in Fig. 2, B and C. In intestine, expression was particularly high in the duodenum and weak in the jejunum, ileum, and proximal and distal colon. Also, no FXYD5 was detected in the stomach (not shown). In kidney, labeling was high in the cortex and much lower in medulla and papilla (Fig. 2C). Characterization of the expression of FXYD5 along the nephron was done by confocal fluorescence microscopy of mouse kidney tissue. No specific signal could be obtained with the anti-C antibody. This is presumably due to the fact that the C terminus of FXYD5 is only 15 amino acids long and is not sufficiently exposed to the antibody in intact membranes. On the other hand, the anti-N antibody bound to some nephron segments (Figs. 3 and 4). Specificity of its binding was demonstrated by the competing effect of the immunizing peptide (Fig. 3A). Labeling of cortical sections with anti-N antibody demonstrated that FXYD5 is expressed on the basolateral surfaces of cells in connecting tubules and initial collecting ducts (Fig. 3C). Double labeling with this antibody (Fig. 3D, green) and a monoclonal antibody to the α1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase (red) shows co-localization of both proteins in the connecting tubules and cortical collecting duct, but a lack of FXYD5 in the distal and proximal convoluted tubules or glomeruli.FIGURE 4Confocal immunolocalization of FXYD5 in kidney medulla. A, section of inner stripe of outer medulla labeled with FXYD5 (green). B, the same section imaged with differential-interference contrast.

Bars, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the inner stripe of outer medulla (ISOM), some cells in the collecting ducts showed distinct basolateral labeling for FXYD5 (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas all cells in adjacent thick ascending limbs of Henle (thick ascending limb) were unlabeled. To identify the ISOM cells labeled by FXYD5, we carried out double labeling of ISOM section for FXYD5 and for the 56-kDa subunit of H-ATPase, an apical marker of intercalated cells (28Nelson R.D. Guo X.L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Such double labeling, depicted in Fig. 4C, demonstrates that the cells labeled basolaterally for FXYD5 (red) also expressed the 56-kDa protein on their apical surface (green), and hence are intercalated cells. The same expression pattern persisted in the first section of the collecting duct in inner medulla (IMCD1), but toward the tip of the papilla there was no labeling for FXYD5 in the collecting duct (IMCD3). Most surprisingly, in this segment cells in the thin limb of Henle showed labeling, and this label was confined to the apical surface (Fig. 4, D and E). Because this apical labeling was seen only adjacent to IMCD3, we assume that it is specific to long loops. Blood vessels did not express FXYD5 in any part of the kidney. Further characterization of the cellular localization of FXYD5 in kidney was done by electron microscopy. Immunogold labeling of sections from ISOM and the first section of inner medulla demonstrated expression of FXYD5 in intercalated cells of the collecting duct but not in principal cells. The gold particles were only associated with the basolateral cell membrane (Fig. 5). Next, we have assessed the possibility that, similar to other FXYD proteins, FXYD5 interacts with the αβ complex of the Na,K-ATPase. Accordingly, kidney cortex microsomes were solubilized in 1 mg/ml C12E10. This detergent was found before to preserve FXYD"

Here we demonstrated the unexpected expression of GADD45β in the embryonic growth plate and uncovered its novel role as an essential mediator of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) expression during terminal chondrocyte differentiation. We identified GADD45β as a prominent early response gene induced by bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) through a Smad1/Runx2-dependent pathway. Because this pathway is involved in skeletal development, we examined mouse embryonic growth plates, and we observed expression of Gadd45β mRNA coincident with Runx2 protein in pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes, whereas GADD45β protein was localized prominently in the nucleus in late stage hypertrophic chondrocytes where Mmp-13 mRNA was expressed. In Gadd45β-/- mouse embryos, defective mineralization and decreased bone growth accompanied deficient Mmp-13 and Col10a1 gene expression in the hypertrophic zone. Transduction of small interfering RNA-GADD45β in epiphyseal chondrocytes in vitro blocked terminal differentiation and the associated expression of Mmp-13 and Col10a1 mRNA in vitro. Finally, GADD45β stimulated MMP-13 promoter activity in chondrocytes through the JNK-mediated phosphorylation of JunD, partnered with Fra2, in synergy with Runx2.

The GADD45 family is known to be associated with cell growth control, apoptotic cell death, and the cellular response to DNA damage (1.Abdollahi A. Lord K.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A.

Nature. 2003; 424: 741-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Initially, GADD45β, encoded by MyD118, was identified as a myeloid differentiation primary response gene activated by IL-6 in murine myeloid leukemia cells upon induction of terminal differentiation (1.Abdollahi A. Lord K.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 165-167PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Selvakumaran M. Lin H.K. Sjin R.T. Reed J.C. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2352-2360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, GADD45β, which is induced by TGF-β in a SMAD-dependent manner, has been identified as a positive regulator of TGF-β-induced apoptosis (4.Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L. Balliet A.G.

Although GADD45α has been identified on DNA microarrays as prominently expressed genes in chondrocytes from adult articular cartilage and in chondrosarcoma or immortalized chondrocyte cell lines (5.Aigner T.

Formation of the vertebrate skeleton through endochondrial ossification, involving progressive differentiation of proliferating chondrocytes to growth-arrested hypertrophic cells, is one of the most complex processes in biology. In the embryonic or postnatal growth plate, terminal chondrocyte differentiation occurs during conversion of cartilage to a vascularized tissue that supports matrix remodeling, cartilage calcification, and recruitment of osteogenic precursors. Cascades of growth and differentiation factors act through positive and negative signaling kinases and transcription factors to tightly control this process. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which were identified originally as molecules that induce ectopic endochondral ossification (7.Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4427) Google Scholar), set the stage for bone morphogenesis by initiating chondrogenesis and by regulating chondrocyte maturation and terminal differentiation to the hypertrophic phenotype (8.Hogan B.L.

Am. 2003; 85: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The actions of the BMPs are determined by spatial and temporal differences in the distribution of BMP-binding proteins, such as noggin and chordin, BMP receptors, and the associated signal-transducing acceptor proteins, Smads 1 and 5, and inhibitory Smads 6 and 7. BMP-2, -4, -6, and -7 are known to stimulate the expression of markers of the hypertrophic phenotype, including type X collagen and alkaline phosphatase (11.Ballock R.T. O'Keefe R.J. J. Bone Jt.

Dev. 2001; 100: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and these responses to BMPs in the growth plate are restricted to pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes derived from regions where endochondral bone will form (13.Volk S.W. Luvalle P. Leask T. Leboy P.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that BMP-induced Smad1 and interactions with the Runt domain transcription factor, Runx2, or Cbfa1, are important for chondrocyte hypertrophy (14.Zheng Q. Zhou G.

Recent evidence indicates that MMP-13 deficiency results in significant interstitial collagen accumulation leading to the delay of endochondral ossification in the growth plate (23.Inada M. Wang Y.

Although the induction of MMP-13 expression by cytokines in chondrocytes (25.Mengshol J.A. Vincenti M.P. Brinckerhoff C.E.

Runx2 is expressed mainly in prehypertrophic and less in late hypertrophic chondrocytes (28.Kim I.S. Otto F. Zabel B. Mundlos S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 29.Takeda S. Bonnamy J.P. Owen M.J. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), whereas MMP-13 is expressed only in the late hypertrophic zone (30.Ortega N. Behonick D.J. Werb Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 86-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 31.Colnot C. Lu C. Hu D. Helms J.A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This spatial discrepancy suggests that unknown intermediate molecules may synchronize with Runx2 to regulate Mmp-13 gene expression. During the course of a study to identify the BMP-2-induced early genes that might be involved in signaling and transcriptional regulation in human chondrocytes, we identified GADD45β as one of the most highly induced genes. We further showed specific induction of GADD45β, but not GADD45α and GADD45γ, by BMP-2, but not by EGF, FGF-2, or IGF-I, by a mechanism involving Smad1-dependent signaling and synergism with Runx2. Because BMP-2 is an important regulator of skeletal development, we examined mouse embryos and demonstrated for the first time that Gadd45β mRNA is expressed by pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes coincident with the Runx2 protein, whereas GADD45β protein accumulates in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Analysis of Gadd45β-/- mouse embryos showed defective mineralization and decreased bone growth accompanied by decreased levels of Mmp-13 and Col10a1 mRNA in hypertrophic chondrocytes. In addition, lentiviral expression of siRNA-GADD45β blocked Mmp-13 gene expression during hypertrophic differentiation of epiphyseal chondrocytes in vitro. Furthermore, we show that GADD45β induces AP-1 transcriptional activity through JNK-mediated phosphorylation of JunD partnered with Fra2 and stimulates Mmp-13 promoter activity in synergism with Runx2. These results indicate that GADD45β has a critical role in mediating matrix remodeling during the final stages of chondrocyte terminal differentiation. Cell Culture—The immortalized human chondrocyte cell line, C-28/I2, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/Ham's F-12 (1/1, v/v; Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (BioWhittaker), as described previously (32.Goldring M.B.

For experiments with growth factors, subconfluent cultures were changed to medium containing 1% Nutridoma-SP (Roche Applied Science) for 24 h prior to incubation in the presence of growth factors. Primary chondrocytes were isolated from human articular cartilage, obtained from intact regions of femoral condyles at the time of total knee replacement surgery, and cultured for 7-10 days in DMEM/Ham's F-12 containing 10% FCS. ATDC5 cells were grown in DMEM/Ham's F-12 containing 5% FCS, 10 μg/ml human insulin, 10 μg/ml human transferrin, and 10 μg/ml selenious acid, as described (34.Shukunami C. Ohta Y. Sakuda M. Hiraki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After incubation in the presence of growth factors for 1 h, cells were harvested for RNA isolation. Three-dimensional pellet cultures of murine rib growth plate chondrocytes were prepared by the method of Ballock and Reddi (35.Ballock R.T. Reddi A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes from the ventral parts of rib cartilage of 2-day-old C57BL/6 mice were cultured in monolayer for 1 day followed by infection with lentiviral vector and culture for 2 days. Using trypsin/EDTA, the cells were resuspended at 1.6 × 105 cells/ml, pelleted at 1 ml per tube in 15-ml conical polypropylene tubes by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and cultured at 37 °C for periods of up to 21 days. RNA Isolation and Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using RNase-free DNase and RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Transcriptional profiling was performed at the Genomics Center of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center on HU133A Affymetrix GeneChips containing 22,283 genes, according to protocols supplied by Affymetrix, with 8 μg of total RNA per sample. For each sample, 20 μg of fragmented cDNA was hybridized with a pre-equilibrated HU133A Affymetrix chip, washed, stained, and scanned in the HP ChipScanner (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA), as described (36.Spentzos D. Levine D.A. Ramoni M.F. Joseph M. Gu X. Boyd J. Libermann T.A. Cannistra S.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 4648-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Microarray data pre-processing was carried out by assigning each sample a quality measure based on criteria such as 3′-5′ ratios, strength of hybridization, and image analysis. The samples that passed these a priori quality control criteria were analyzed using dChip software (37.Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar), by which smoothing spline normalization was applied prior to obtaining model-based gene expression indices or signal values. When comparing two groups of samples to identify the genes enriched in a given phenotype, we used the lower confidence bound of the fold change between the experiment and the base line. If the 90% lower confidence bound of the fold change between the experiment and the base line was above 1.2, the corresponding gene was considered to be differentially expressed (38.Ramalho-Santos M. Yoon S. Matsuzaki Y. Mulligan R.C. Melton D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Real Time PCR—For each sample, cDNA was generated as described previously (33.Tan L. Peng H. Osaki M. Choy B.K. Auron P.E. Sandell L.J. Goldring M.B. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analysis—After incubation without or with BMP-2 at 100 ng/ml for 1 h, the C-28/I2 cells were collected by scraping, and total protein was extracted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were analyzed on Western blots using antibody against total Smad1 or phospho-Smad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling). For immunoprecipitations, the capture protein for the Runx2 antibody (PEBP2aA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was coated at 200 μl/well in a 96-well flat bottom, high binding microplate (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) at a final protein concentration of 2.4 μg/ml in 50 mm carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plate was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), blocked by applying 200 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBST to each well, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were washed three times with PBST. Cell lysate (1.1 mg of protein) was applied to each well, incubated at room temperature for 4 h, and washed three times with PBST. The bound protein was eluted with 1× SDS sample buffer and carefully loaded on a Tris-glycine SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting with rabbit anti-phosphoserine antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or the total Smad1 antibody (Cell Signaling). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in Situ Hybridization—Hind limbs were collected from C57BL/6 mouse embryos fixed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde. Limbs were embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were obtained. Tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through an ethanol series for use in either IHC or in situ hybridization. For IHC, tissue sections were subjected to microwave antigen retrieval in 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) at 93 °C for 7 min and allowed to cool for at least 2 h. Sections were blocked with normal horse serum (for GADD45β IHC) or normal swine serum (for Runx2 IHC). IHC for GADD45β was performed as described previously (41.Qiu W. David D. Zhou B. Chu P.G.

Anti-Runx2 antibody (PEBP2αA, sc-10758, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:25 dilution, 8 μg/ml final concentration), swine biotinylated anti-rabbit F(ab)2, and streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (DAKO, Denmark) were used to detect Runx2 by IHC. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For negative controls, normal goat IgG (sc-2028) and normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027) were used in place of the primary antibodies against GADD45β and Runx2, respectively. We optimized the staining methods for detection of cytoplasmic and nuclear staining with each antibody by testing both microwave and enzyme retrieval of each antigen. For in situ hybridization, a 391-bp fragment of human GADD45β cDNA (sense, 5′-CTGGTTGTTGCCCCGGCTTTCTTC-3′; antisense, 5′-CGCGGTGGAGGAGCTTTTGGTG-3′) and a 1006-bp fragment of mouse MMP-13 cDNA (sense, 5′CATCCACATGGTTGGGAAGTTCTG-3′;antisense,5′-CATTCAGCTATCCTGGCCACCTTC-3′) were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR and subcloned in the pCR II vector (Invitrogen). Plasmids were linearized using either HindIII or NotI for GADD45β and either KpnI or XhoI for MMP-13, respectively. The linearized plasmids served as templates for riboprobe synthesis using either T7 or SP6 RNA polymerases and digoxigenin-UTP RNA labeling nucleotide mix (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA encoding type X collagen was a kind gift of Dr. Bjorn Olsen, Harvard Medical School, Boston. Hybridization was performed according to the method described previously (42.Kartsogiannis V.

Immun. 2004; 5: 38-44Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, the targeting vector was constructed to replace exons 3 and 4, encoding the region crucial for interaction with MTK-1/MEKK4 (44.Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), with the neomycin resistance cassette. Gadd45β-/- embryos and wild type littermates at 14.5, 15.5, 16.5, and 17.5 days post-conception (dpc), generated with the approval of the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C and stored in 70% ethanol at room temperature. Whole embryos were stained with Alcian Blue and Alizarin Red. Long bones were sectioned and stained with toluidine blue or von Kossa or analyzed by in situ hybridization as described above. Plasmids—The human GADD45β promoter fragment spanning -1604 to +141 was prepared by PCR using human genomic DNA (Clontech) as template. The PCRs were carried out using the Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and the products were subcloned in the pGL2-basic vector (Promega, Madison WI) and verified by DNA sequencing. Smad1, Smad4, and alk6 expression vectors were gifts from Dr. Xu Cao (University of Alabama). The Runx2 and ΔRunx2 expression vectors were described previously (45.Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M.

The pcDNA3-GADD45β-FLAG plasmid was generated as described previously (40.Zerbini L.F. Wang Y. Czibere A. Correa R.G. Cho J.Y. Ijiri K. Wei W. Joseph M. Gu X. Grall F. Goldring M.B. Zhou J.R.

The MMP-13 promoter sequence spanning-1007/+26 bp was prepared by PCR using a pCAT-MMP-13 promoter construct 5M. Rahman, unpublished data. as a template, and cloned in the pGL2-B vector in the XmaI and XhoI sites. Expression vectors for JunD, JunB, Fra1, and Fra2 were kindly provided by Dr. Paul R. Dobner (University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA). The dominant negative JunD was described previously (46.Zerbini L.F. Wang Y. Cho J.Y. Libermann T.A.

Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assay—Transient transfection experiments were performed in C-28/I2 cells and ATDC5 cells using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), as described (33.Tan L. Peng H.

Cells were plated at 100,000 cells per well and transfected with 300 ng of pGL2-promoter plasmid and 10-100 ng of expression plasmid. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h later using the dualluciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Cotransfection with pRL-TK Renilla luciferase control vector was used for controlling transfection efficiency. Cotransfections of the promoter-less pGL2-B vector with expression plasmids did not significantly increase activity compared with promoter-containing vectors. This is in contrast to a study showing that 1 μg of Runx2 expression vector increased luciferase activity when cotransfected with 1 μg of promoter-less pGL2 or pGL3 vector in cells plated in 6-well plates (47.Thirunavukkarasu K. Miles R.R. Halladay D.L. Onyia J.E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in triplicate, and experiments were repeated three times with different plasmid preparations with similar results. Knockdown of GADD45β Expression by siRNA—Two approaches were used. First, chemically synthesized complementary RNA oligonucleotides (siRNA-GADD45β sense-strand sequence, 5′-AAGTTGATGAATGTGGACCCA) were annealed, deprotected, and desalted as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). A total of 50 μm RNA duplexes was transfected into cells using TKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) and tested for specificity and efficiency, as described previously (40.Zerbini L.F.

Second, a lentiviral vector containing siRNA-GADD45β was constructed using single 83-mer oligonucleotides containing an XbaI site at the 5′ end, an intermediate short spacer, and a partial sequence of the H1-RNA promoter at the 3′ end, as described previously (40.Zerbini L.F.

Cellular activation by CCR5 itself, but also by unrelated receptors leads to cross-phosphorylation and cross-internalization of CCR5. This study addresses the underlying molecular mechanisms of homologous and heterologous CCR5 regulation. As shown by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments, CCR5 formed constitutive homo- as well as heterooligomeric complexes together with C5aR but not with the unrelated AT1aR in living cells. Stimulation with CCL5 of RBL cells, which co-expressed CCR5 together with an N-terminally truncated CCR5-ΔNT mutant, resulted in both protein kinase C (PKC)- and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase (GRK)-mediated cross-phosphorylation of the mutant unligated receptor, as determined by phosphosite-specific monoclonal antibody. Similarly, both PKC and GRK cross-phosphorylated CCR5 in a heterologous manner after C5a stimulation of RBL-CCR5/C5aR cells, whereas AT1aR stimulation resulted only in classical PKC-mediated CCR5 phosphorylation. Co-expression of CCR5-ΔNT together with a phosphorylation-deficient CCR5 mutant that neither binds β-arrestin nor undergoes internalization partially restored the CCL5-induced association of β-arrestin with the homo-oligomeric receptor complex and augmented cellular uptake of 125I-CCL5. Co-expression of C5aR, but not of AT1aR, promoted CCR5 co-internalization upon agonist stimulation by a mechanism independent of CCR5 phosphorylation. Co-internalization of phosphorylated CCR5 was also observed in C5a-stimulated macrophages. Finally, co-expression of a constitutively internalized C5aR-US28CT mutant led to intracellular accumulation of CCR5 in the absence of ligand stimulation. These results show that GRKs and β-arrestin are involved in heterologous receptor regulation by cross-phosphorylating and co-internalizing unligated receptors within homo- or hetero-oligomeric protein complexes.

Leukocytes express multiple pertussis toxin-sensitive chemoattractant receptors that may be engaged simultaneously or sequentially as these cells are recruited into tissue sites of inflammation. Interaction of such receptors with their cognate ligands results, among other cellular functions, in directional cell movement, integrin activation, and release of granular contents (1Moser B. Wolf M. Walz A. Loetscher P. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, receptors also undergo adaptive changes, which include desensitization and internalization. Two major mechanisms of rapid receptor regulation have been discriminated, namely homologous (agonist-specific) and heterologous (agonist-nonspecific) desensitization, and both mechanisms are believed to be important in fine tuning leukocyte responses (2Ali H. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).Homologous desensitization involves phosphorylation of ligand-occupied receptors by members of the GPCR 3The abbreviations used are: GPCRheterotrimeric GTP-binding protein-coupled receptorABSantibody binding sitesAT1aRtype 1a angiotensin II receptorAUarbitrary unitBRETbioluminescence resonance energy transferCCR5CC chemokine receptor 5CCL5also known as RANTES (released on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted)ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGRKGPCR kinaseHEK-293 cellshuman embryonic kidney 293 cellsHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusmAbmonoclonal antibodypCCR5phosphorylated CCR5PKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateRBL-2H3 cellsrat basophilic leukemia cellsPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTMtransmembraneNTN-terminalWTwild typePBSphosphate-buffered salineQFACSquantitative fluorescent-activated cell sorterHAhemagglutininFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateMCFmean channel of fluorescence 3The abbreviations used are: GPCRheterotrimeric GTP-binding protein-coupled receptorABSantibody binding sitesAT1aRtype 1a angiotensin II receptorAUarbitrary unitBRETbioluminescence resonance energy transferCCR5CC chemokine receptor 5CCL5also known as RANTES (released on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted)ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGRKGPCR kinaseHEK-293 cellshuman embryonic kidney 293 cellsHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusmAbmonoclonal antibodypCCR5phosphorylated CCR5PKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateRBL-2H3 cellsrat basophilic leukemia cellsPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTMtransmembraneNTN-terminalWTwild typePBSphosphate-buffered salineQFACSquantitative fluorescent-activated cell sorterHAhemagglutininFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateMCFmean channel of fluorescence kinase (GRK) family with, according to the current paradigm, essentially no effect on other receptors expressed in the same cell (3Pitcher J.A.

(Lond.). 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These kinases often phosphorylate serine/threonine residues present in the C-terminal domains of chemotactic leukocyte receptors, which then induce association of the phosphorylated receptors with β-arrestins. β-Arrestins bound to receptors physically interfere with further G protein coupling, initiate endocytosis through clathrin-coated vesicles, and act as scaffolding proteins for various signaling molecules (5Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 130-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast, heterologous desensitization is traditionally defined as a state of cellular refractoriness to multiple agonists following phosphorylation of receptor sites different from GRKs by second messenger-activated protein kinases, which have been activated by other receptors or signaling pathways. Mechanisms downstream of the receptor that involve decreased activation of phospholipase C-β also contribute to heterologous receptor desensitization (2Ali H. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Whereas second messenger-activated protein kinases affect homologous desensitization through their ability to phosphorylate GRKs, which modulates their kinase activities in different ways (6Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), GRKs are generally thought not to be involved in heterologous regulation of unligated GPCR.According to the traditional view of GPCR regulation, these membrane proteins operate as monomeric entities. However, recent evidence based on biochemical and biophysical studies show that GPCR form homo- or heterodimeric (oligomeric) complexes in vivo (7Terrillon S. Bouvier M. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Despite the large number of studies that demonstrate dimerization of different GPCR, some of which also address functional aspects, the implications of these findings for GPCR regulation by receptor kinases and β-arrestins have not been fully investigated. In the present study, we chose to address this aspect of GPCR regulation using the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) as a model. A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the function and cell surface expression of CCR5, one of the two major co-receptors for the human immunodeficiency viruses, is of particular interest because down-modulation of CCR5 can prevent HIV entry into target cells (8Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 9Mack M.

Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have unanimously shown that CCR5 forms homo- and hetero-oligomeric protein complexes, but conflicting results have been reported for whether CCR5 oligomerization is important for signaling or HIV co-receptor function of CCR5 (10Vila-Coro A.J.

Immunol. 2005; 6: 535-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).By combining a functional complementation approach with the use of phosphosite-specific antibodies that allow us to monitor GRK-versus PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the CCR5 in whole cells, we provide here the first direct evidence that GRKs can also cross-phosphorylate unligated GPCR if they form homo- or heterooligomeric complexes with other receptors that undergo GRK-mediated phosphorylation. These findings suggest an alternative model of heterologous receptor desensitization and cross-internalization, which also involves GRKs and β-arrestins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Most reagents have been reported before (14Hüttenrauch F.

Sgodda and M. Oppermann, unpublished data. All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich.Eukaryotic Expression Constructs—An N-terminally truncated (CCR5-ΔNT) version of CCR5 was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a mutagenic 5′-oligonucleotide, which replaced amino acids 2–17 of the CCR5 N terminus with an HA (YPYDVPDYA) epitope tag. A3′-oligonucleotide corresponding to the C5aR tail replacing either all ten C-terminal serine and threonine residues (C5aR-S–T–) or only the six serine residues located in the C-terminal tail at positions 314, 317, 327, 332, 334, and 338 (C5aR-S–) was used to generate phosphorylation-deficient C5aR mutants. For the C5aR-US28CT mutant, the 59 C-terminal amino acid residues of US28, a 7-transmembrane receptor encoded by human cytomegalovirus, were amplified by PCR and cloned into the naturally occurring FseI site of C5aR, thereby replacing the 46 C-terminal amino acids of human C5aR. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pEF1/Myc-His (Invitrogen), and the coding sequences of all mutated cDNAs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Expression vectors encoding phosphorylation-deficient CCR5 with alanine exchange C-terminal serine residues (CCR5-P–; CCR5-P–(Ser349 of)) were described before (14Hüttenrauch F. Nitzki A. Lin F.T.

Transfected RBL cells were maintained in 80:20 –10 medium (80 parts RPMI 1640, 20 parts medium 199, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 600 μg/ml geniticin) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per 40-mm dish. Transient transfections were performed the following day using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Transfection efficiencies determined by flow cytometry with an anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody (T21/8) ranged between 50 and 85%.Monocyte-derived macrophages were isolated from human leukocytes by leukapheresis from volunteer blood donors at the University Clinic of Göttingen. Mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Hypaque discontinuous gradient. The cells were cultured for 1 h at 1 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated autologous serum in flat bottom plates. After washing off nonadherent cells, adherent cells (>80% monocytes) were cultured for 5–7 days in the same medium to obtain macrophages.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—RBL cell lines stably expressing HA-tagged N-terminally truncated (CCR5-ΔNT), phosphorylation-deficient CCR5 (CCR5-P–), C5aR alone or in various combinations were lysed by treatment with detergent buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm EDTA containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described, Ref. 17Oppermann M.

Following centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min) receptors were immunoprecipitated (2 h at 4 °C) with 12 μg of anti-CCR5 R22/7, anti-C5aR S5/1, or anti-HA 12CA5 antibodies and protein G-Sepharose. After four wash steps, receptors were eluted by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in SDS sample buffer containing 0.2% SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblots were performed using phospho-CCR5-specific monoclonal anti-pSer337 V14/2 or anti-pSer349 E11/19 (5 μg/ml) antibodies (15Pollok-Kopp B. Schwarze K. Baradari V.K. Oppermann M. J. Biol.

Enhanced chemiluminescence detection of antigens was achieved with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Afterward membranes were stripped and reprobed for total cellular receptors with anti-HA 12CA5 peroxidase conjugate (1:5000).CCR5 Phosphorylation Assays—Ligand-induced phosphorylation of CCR5 C-terminal serine residues at positions 337 and 349 were determined by immunoblotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which are based on different phosphosite-specific mAbs (15Pollok-Kopp B. Schwarze K. Baradari V.K. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2190-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For ELISA, 1.5 × 106 RBL cells expressing CCR5 and C5aR variants were incubated in 40-mm wells for various times at 37 °C with stimulus and scraped in 0.7 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS with phosphatase and protease inhibitors). Following centrifugation (3,000 × g for 10 min), supernatants were applied (1 h at room temperature) into wells of microtiter plates coated with the anti-CCR5 mAb T21/8 (5 μg/ml). After washing twice, wells were incubated (1 h at room temperature) with biotinylated mAb E11/19 and V14/2 μ (1 g/ml PBS-0.5% Tween) with specificities for phosphorylated Ser349 and Ser337, respectively. Immune complexes were detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and 2.2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate) as substrate. The assays were calibrated with a synthetic bovine serum albumin-CCR5-(phospho)peptide standard protein. Results were expressed in relative units (r.u.) (1 r.u. equals 1 ng of bovine serum albuminpeptide per ml). For immunoblotting, receptors were immunoprecipitated as described above, except that cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and samples were resuspended in sample buffer containing 5% SDS.Whole cell phosphorylation experiments using 32P incorporation into CCR5 or C5aR were performed, in general, as described before (18Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). RBL-CCR5 cells were labeled with 32Pi (150 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free medium for 45 min in the presence of 0–2 μm bisindolylmaleimide (15 min). After incubation with stimulus, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 700 μl of lysis buffer. Insoluble material was pelleted (5 min, 20,000 × g), and receptors were immunoprecipitated with 12 μgof CCR5-specific mAb R22/7 and protein G-Sepharose. Receptors were solubilized in sample buffer containing 5% SDS and resolved by SDS-PAGE with equal amounts of receptor protein in each lane. 32P incorporation into receptors was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by phosphorimager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). For two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis, receptors were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, excised, and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl (2 h at 110 °C). Hydrolysates were resolubilized in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid/acetic acid/H2O, 50:156:1794 (v/v/v)) and spotted on a thin layer cellulose plate. Phosphoamino acids were separated by electrophoresis (900 V for 1.5 h) at pH 1.9 buffer, followed by a second electrophoresis (900 V for 45 min) at pH 3.5 (pyridine/acetic acid/H2O, 10:100:1890 (v/v/v) and 0.5 mm EDTA) in the orthogonal direction. After ninhydrin staining of phosphoamino acid standards, thin layer plates were exposed to autoradiographic screens.Quantitative FACS (QFACS) Analysis and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Receptor expression levels on transfected cell lines and on monocytes were determined by quantitative FACS analysis. QFACS was performed by converting the mean channel of fluorescence (MCF) into antibody binding sites (ABS) per cell by using a standardized microbeads kit (Quantum Simply Cellular kit, Sigma). This kit consists of a mixture of four separate microbead populations with incremental capacities to bind mouse Ig. Briefly, beads (105 per sample) were incubated with the same saturating concentrations of antibodies as the samples and treated like the samples being quantitated. FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig was used as secondary detecting reagents. The binding capacities of the stained microbeads were then regressed against the corresponding MCF of each bead population, and the MCF of the receptor epitope on the sample cells was converted to ABS per cell by comparison with regression curve (QuickCal software).Monocyte-derived macrophages were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates. After fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4 in PBS for 20 min on ice, free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized with cold PBS containing 0.05% saponin, 0.2% gelatin for 15 min, washed once with the same buffer, and stained with anti-CCR5 (T21/8), anti-CCR5-pSer349 (E11/19), or anti-C5aR (S5/1) antibodies (10 μg/ml in PBS-saponin) for 1 h on ice. After washing with PBS-saponin-gelatin, goat anti-mouse Ig FITC-conjugate (Dako) (1:100 dilution) was added for 1 h. After further washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted in Mowiol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine. The samples were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy utilizing a Leica TCS SP2 system, and images were assembled in Adobe Photoshop.BRET Assay—Two days after transfection, HEK-293 cells were suspended in buffer (0.1 g/liter CaCl2, 0.1 g/liter MgCl2, 1 g/liter d-glucose in PBS) and washed once in the same buffer. Cells were distributed in duplicate into 96-well microplates (white Optiplate, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a density of ∼5 × 104 cells per well. Deep Blue C (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were collected immediately after addition of the coelenterazine (Molecular Probes) using a Mithras LP940 microplate analyzer (Berthold). The BRET signal is expressed as the ratio of light emitted by the GFP2 construct (500–530 nm) over the light emitted by the hRluc construct (370–450 nm), corrected for Rf, which corresponds to the signal in cells that express only the hRluc construct in the same experiment. Total GFP fluorescence and luminescence signals were determined, in parallel, for all samples using coelenterazine H, 5 μm) and the Mithras plate reader to assess expression levels of the GFP2 and Rluc conjugates.Functional Assays—The CCL5-induced N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase release from CCR5-expressing RBL-2H3 cells was determined as described (20Montz H. Fuhrmann A. Schulze M. Götze O. Cell Immunol. 1990; 127: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Values were expressed as a percentage of total enzyme present in cells after lysis with 0.1% Triton X-100, and data were analyzed using nonlinear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose response model with the Ligand Binding module of Sigma-Plot software (SPSS).Agonist-dependent intracellular calcium mobilization was measured in transfected RBL-2H3 cells as described (18Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Calcium decays from 80% of the peak height to basal levels were fitted to an exponential (a + b·e–t//τ) where the time constant τ reflects the ability of CCR5 variants to evoke a more or less sustained calcium response (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.J. Tardif M. Milcent M.D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Internalization Assays—The internalization of 125I-C5a by transfected RBL-2H3 cells was determined as described before (19Kraft K. Olbrich H. Majoul I. Mack M. Proudfoot A. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34408-34418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated with binding medium (BM; RPMI1640 without bicarbonate, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 125 pm of 125I-C5a for 90 min at 4 °C. Unbound ligand was removed by washing at 4 °C. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for different times (0, 3, 10, 30 min) to initiate internalization. In half of the wells for each time point, surface-bound radioligand was removed by two 3-min acid washes at pH 2.5. The specific radioligand uptake was calculated as acid-resistant counts in 0.1 n NaOH extracts of acid-washed cells divided by the total cell-associated activity in cells washed at pH 7.4 after subtraction of nonspecific binding at time 0.The agonist-induced down-modulation of CCR5 co-expressed at the RBL cell surface together with C5aR variants or AT1aR was measured using radiolabeled antibodies. To this end, T21/8 anti-CCR5 mAb was iodinated by the 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent to a specific activity of 1100 Ci/mmol. Adherent cells were treated with 100 nm C5a in BM for up to 2 h at 37 °C and then transferred to ice. After washing with ice-cold BM, cells were incubated with 125I-T21/8 (0.2 μg/ml BM) for 1.5 h. Cellbound activity was measured by scintillation counting after four final washes with cold BM. The same protocol was used to determine homologous internalization of C5aR (100 nm C5a; 125I-S5/1), CCR5 (100 nm CCL5; 125I-T21/8), or AT1aR (100 nm Ang II; 125I-12CA5).The agonist-induced internalization of CCR5 and C5aR in macrophages was determined by quantitative FACS analysis. Monocyte-derived macrophages (5 × 105 in 100 μl) were incubated (2 h at 37 °C) with medium containing either 100 nm C5a or 100 nm CCL5. Thereafter, cells were cooled to 4 °C and T21/8 (CCR5) or S5/1 (C5aR) antibody binding sites on the surface of stimulated compared with untreated cells were determined by QFACS as described above.β-Arrestin Translocation Assay—The CCL5- or C5a-induced translocation of the two endogenous β-arrestin isoforms from the cytosol to the plasma membrane was determined in RBL cells by subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting (14Hüttenrauch F. Nitzki A. Lin F.T. Höning S. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30769-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In brief, C5aR- or CCR5-expressing RBL cells were incubated in the presence of 10 nm CCL5 or 20 nm C5a for 3 min at 37 °C. The cells were placed on ice and scraped into 3 ml of buffer A (10 mm PIPES, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) containing protease inhibitors. After homogenization and centrifugation (1000 × g for 20 min) the supernatant was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 160,000 × g (4 °C for 2 h). The 35/50% sucrose interphase (membrane fraction) was collected, diluted in 3 ml of buffer A and re-centrifuged (160,000 × g for 15 min). The pellet was resuspended in detergent buffer (19Kraft K. Olbrich H. Majoul I. Mack M. Proudfoot A. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34408-34418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and equal amounts (25 μg) of all samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation for 30 min with 4% nonfat dry milk in TBS-0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4. β-Arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 were detected using the monoclonal anti-β-arrestin antibody 21-B1 (10 μg/ml) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (1:2000). β-Arrestin levels in the membrane fractions were quantitated by densitometric analysis (ImageMaste"

This occurs at nanomolar concentrations, which are the predicted endogenous levels of extracellular neuronal Zn2+. Using structural modeling and functional mutagenesis, we have identified the molecular basis for the elusive Zn2+ potentiation site on GlyRs and account for the differential sensitivity of GlyR α1 and GlyR α2 to Zn2+ potentiation. In addition, juxtaposed to this Zn2+ site, which is located externally on the N-terminal domain of the α subunit, another residue was identified in the nearby Cys loop, a region that is critical for receptor gating in all Cys loop ligand-gated ion channels. This residue acted as a key control element in the allosteric transduction pathway for Zn2+ potentiation, enabling either potentiation or overt inhibition of receptor activation depending upon the moiety resident at this location. Overall, we propose that Zn2+ binds to a site on the extracellular outer face of the GlyR α subunit and exerts its positive allosteric effect via an interaction with the Cys loop to increase the efficacy of glycine receptor gating.

The glycine receptor is a major component of inhibitory neurotransmission in the spinal cord and brainstem (1Lynch J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1051-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). It forms part of the Cys loop receptor family, which includes acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA), 3The abbreviations used are: GABAAγ-aminobutyric acid type AGABAA/CRγ-aminobutyric acid receptor type A/CGlyRglycine receptorHEKhuman embryonic kidneyMTSEA2-aminoethyl-methanesulphonateRIreduced inhibitionTMtransmembrane and serotonin type 3 receptors (2Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Glycine receptors are pentameric assemblies of ligand binding α(1–4) subunits and the homologous structural β subunit (3Pfeiffer F. Graham D. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9389-9393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit has an extracellular N-terminal domain followed by four transmembrane (TM) segments connected by two intracellular regions and an extracellular TM2-TM3 linker, which is important for receptor gating (4Lester H.A. Dibas M.I. Dahan D.S. Leite J.F. Dougherty D.A. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The function of these receptors can be enhanced by a variety of agents, including alcohols, anesthetics, neurosteroids, and Zn2+ (5Harrison N.L. Kugler J.L. Jones M.V. Greenblatt E.P. Pritchett D.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 628-632PubMed Google Scholar, 6Celentano J.J. Gibbs T.T. Farb D.H. Brain Res. 1988; 455: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 7Wu F.S. Chen S.C. Tsai J.J.

Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). With regard to GlyRs, Zn2+ exhibits biphasic activity, potentiating receptor activation at submicromolar Zn2+ concentrations and causing inhibition at concentrations >10 μm (8Bloomenthal A.B. Goldwater E. Pritchett D.B. Harrison N.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1156-1159PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study demonstrates that the mutation D80A in the extracellular domain of the GlyR α1 subunit ablated Zn2+ potentiation, and it is proposed that this residue participates in the direct coordination of Zn2+ (10Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Laube B. Maksay G. Schemm R. Betz H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 519-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, an additional report indicates that the Zn2+ potentiation of responses to the partial agonist taurine, which binds to the same agonist site as glycine, is unaffected by mutating Asp-80. This suggests that either multiple Zn2+ binding sites exist or that this mutation induces an indirect allosteric effect on receptor function that selectively disrupts Zn2+ potentiation of responses to glycine rather than those to taurine (12Lynch J.W. Jacques P. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In accord with an indirect allosteric effect, mutations of several other residues in the TM2-TM3 linker are capable of disrupting Zn2+ potentiation, though none of these residues are chemically suitable for the direct coordination of Zn2+. The high sensitivity of the strychnine-sensitive GlyR to Zn2+ potentiation makes this receptor an ideal substrate for modulation by basal levels of Zn2+. In a physiological context, Zn2+ is released following neuronal stimulation (13Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 14Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J. Nature. 1984; 308: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and can also modulate inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors at basal concentrations (15Xie X.M. Smart T.G. Nature. 1991; 349: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 16Ruiz A. Walker M.C. Fabian-Fine R. Kullmann D.M. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Zn2+ is concentrated into synaptic boutons that also contain either glutamate, GABA, or glycine in many areas of the brain, including the cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord (17Birinyi A. Parker D. Antal M. Shupliakov O. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 433: 208-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Brown C.E. Dyck R.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2617-2625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Frederickson C.J. Danscher G. Prog. Brain Res. 1990; 83: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although the predicted concentration of Zn2+ resulting from presynaptic release is probably <10 μm (20Frederickson C.J. Bush A.I. Biometals. 2001; 14: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), this is more than sufficient to modulate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, certain GABAA receptor subtypes, and GlyRs (8Bloomenthal A.B. Goldwater E. Pritchett D.B. Harrison N.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1156-1159PubMed Google Scholar, 21Smart T.G. Xie X. Krishek B.J. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1994; 42: 341-393Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Indeed, low nanomolar basal Zn2+ concentrations are adequate to prolong the decay phase of glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (22Suwa H. Saint-Amant L. Triller A. Drapeau P. Legendre P. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we accounted for the differential sensitivity to Zn2+ potentiation of GlyR α1 and GlyR α2 by identifying the location of a single conserved residue in the N-terminal domain. Subsequently, by using structural homology modeling together with the identified residue underlying Zn2+ sensitivity, we established the molecular determinants for the elusive Zn2+ potentiation binding site. In doing so, we uncovered a prospective transduction residue for this site that is located in the Cys loop-gating domain, providing a plausible molecular pathway for Zn2+ potentiation of glycine receptor gating. cDNA Constructs—Human (h) wild-type cDNA constructs were used for hGlyR α1L, hGlyR α2A, and hGlyR β. Site-specific mutant cDNAs were prepared using the Stratagene Quikchange mutagenesis kit. The mutated sequences were confirmed by complete sequencing of the cDNA insert using an ABI sequencer. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL1573) were grown and transfected as previously documented (23Wilkins M.E. Hosie A.M. Smart T.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5328-5333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids of hGlyR cDNA clones were co-transfected in a ratio of 1:1 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (24Cubitt A.B. Heim R. Adams S.R. Boyd A.E. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). To co-express GlyR αβ heteromers, β subunit cDNA was added in excess at a ratio of 20:1 to α subunit cDNA. HEK cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (100 μg/ml) sufficient to achieve 20% confluence and used for recording on the next day. Solutions—The internal pipette solution contained (mm): 140 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, and 2 ATP, pH 7.2 (≈ 300 mosm). The external Krebs solution consisted of (mm): 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 11 d-glucose, pH 7.4 (≈ 300 mosm). For those experiments requiring control over the basal levels of Zn2+ (see Fig. 1), tricine was used with an assumed KD for Zn2+ complexation of 10−5m (25Paoletti P. Ascher P. Neyton J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5711-5725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, 0.26, 0.78, 2.6, 7.8, 26, 77.5, 254, and 775 μm Zn2+ provided effective free Zn2+ concentrations of 0.8, 2.68, 8, 26.8, 80, 268, 2680, and 8620 nm, respectively (calculated with WINMAXC software, version 2.4). The cysteine accessibility experiments required the incubation of 2-amino-ethyl-methanesulphonate (MTSEA), prepared in Krebs-Ringer solution immediately before application, with HEK cells for 1 min at a concentration of 3 mm (Insight Biotechnology, Ltd). Electrophysiology—An Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) recorded whole-cell currents from single HEK cells using the patch clamp technique. HEK cells exhibited resting potentials between −10 and −40 mV and were voltage-clamped at a −40 mV holding potential. The cells were visualized with differential interference contrast optics using a Nikon Optiphot microscope with an epifluorescence attachment to identify green fluorescent protein-transfected cells. A Y-tube was used to rapidly apply drugs and Krebs solutions (exchange rate ∼50–100 ms) to the recorded cells. Patch electrodes were fabricated using a Narashige PC-10 puller with resistances, after polishing, of 4–5 megohms. All recordings were performed in constantly perfusing Krebs-Ringer solution at room temperature (20–22 °C). Data Acquisition and Analysis—Recorded currents were filtered using a high pass Bessel filter at 3 kHz (−36 db/octave), and series resistance compensation was achieved up to 70%. Data were recorded in 20-s acquisition epochs directly to a Pentium IV, 1.8 GHz computer into Clampex software, version 8.0, via a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments) sampling at 200-μs intervals. Zn2+ was co-applied with the agonist to attenuate any delayed onset of Zn2+-mediated inhibition. Strychnine and picrotoxin were pre-incubated for 15 s, sufficient to attain equilibrium, and then also co-applied with the agonist. The digitized membrane current records were analyzed off-line using Axoscope, version 8.2. Biphasic (potentiation and inhibition) Zn2+ concentration response curves were fitted according to a modified Hill equation as previously described (26Harvey R.J. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Where a single component to the concentration response relationships was evident, it was fitted with a form of the Hill equation. For the agonist and Zn2+ concentration potentiation curves, I = Imin + (Imax - Imin)([1/(1 + (EC50/A)nH)]), and for the strychnine and Zn2+ concentration-inhibition curves, I/Imax = 1 - [1/(1 + (IC50/B)mH)]. The EC50 represents either the concentration of agonist-inducing or Zn2+-potentiating (A) 50% of the maximal current (Imax) evoked or potentiated by a saturating concentration of agonist or Zn2+, and n is the Hill coefficient. For Zn2+ potentiation, Imin represents the control glycine current in the absence of Zn2+ and was set to 100%. For inhibition, the IC50 defines the antagonist concentration (B) producing a 50% inhibition of the current, and mH represents the Hill coefficient. When Zn2+ induced a biphasic inhibition, the concentration response data were fitted with a two-component inhibitory curve using I/Imax = 1 - (aBmH/(BmH + IC50mH)) + (bBmH/(BmH + IC50mH)), where a and b represent the relative proportions of each inhibitory component. All statistical comparisons used an unpaired t test. Structural Homology Modeling—The mature N-terminal extracellular domain of the hGlyRα1 subunit was modeled on the crystal structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein (27Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) using SwissProt DeepView, version 3.7, in accordance with a ClustalW protein alignment. All three-dimensional images were subsequently rendered using the freeware program POV-Ray. GlyR α1 and α2 Exhibit Distinct Sensitivities to Zn2+ Potentiation— The sensitivity of the GlyR α1 and α2 subtypes to Zn2+ potentiation was assessed from whole-cell recordings of half-maximal (EC50) responses to glycine obtained from transfected HEK cells maintained at −40 mV holding potential (Fig. 1A). To accurately compare the modulation of GlyR α1 and GlyR α2 at submicromolar concentrations of Zn2+, the buffer tricine (25Paoletti P. Ascher P. Neyton J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5711-5725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to remove Zn2+ contamination in the external Krebs solution (22Suwa H. Saint-Amant L. Triller A. Drapeau P. Legendre P. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The α1 subtype, considered to be an adult form of the GlyR and highly expressed throughout the spinal cord and brainstem (1Lynch J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1051-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), exhibited a very high sensitivity to Zn2+ potentiation with an EC50 of only 37 ± 10 nm (n = 5) (Fig. 1B). This sensitivity is comparable with the high affinity inhibitory Zn2+ site found on the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2A subunit (25Paoletti P. Ascher P. Neyton J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5711-5725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By comparison, the principal embryonic subtype GlyR α2 (1Lynch J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1051-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) also displayed a high nanomolar sensitivity to Zn2+ potentiation with an EC50 of 540 ± 180 nm (n = 5) but was nevertheless 15-fold less sensitive than the GlyR α1 isoform (p < 0.05). This difference in sensitivity was unaffected by co-expression with the GlyR ancillary β subunit (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C), which assemble to form αβ heteromeric receptors, as confirmed by an approximate 20-fold shift in the sensitivity to picrotoxin (data not shown) (28Pribilla I. Takagi T. Langosch D. Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The Hill slopes for Zn2+-mediated potentiation varied between 1.2 and 1.5, suggesting more than one Zn2+ ion was probably coordinated by each receptor. To identify the structural determinant(s) responsible for differential Zn2+ sensitivity, the extracellular domains were scanned for the classical Zn2+ binding residues, Cys, Asp, Glu, and His (9Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), focusing particularly on differences between GlyR α1 and α2. On this basis, four residues were prioritized (Fig. 1D). Upon individual substitution of the GlyR α1 variants into GlyR α2, no influence on Zn2+ sensitivity was observed for S179E, D180Q, or E187D mutated receptors (data not shown). However, a single conservative E201D substitution was found to be sufficient and necessary to enable GlyR α2 to exhibit a similar sensitivity to GlyR α1 toward potentiation by Zn2+ (Fig. 1, B and D). A Cluster of GlyR α1 Residues Are Essential for Zn2+ Potentiation— The discovery that GlyR α1 Asp-194 (which corresponds to GlyR α2 Glu-201) is capable of influencing the sensitivity to potentiating Zn2+, suggested that this moiety might be a direct contributor to Zn2+ binding, forming part of the potentiation site. This hypothesis was examined by mutating α1 Asp-194 to alanine, a residue incapable of coordinating Zn2+. However, because of the biphasic nature of Zn2+ action at the GlyR, where Zn2+ potentiates at nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations and inhibits at doses >10 μm (8Bloomenthal A.B. Goldwater E. Pritchett D.B. Harrison N.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1156-1159PubMed Google Scholar), any attempt to measure a reduced sensitivity to Zn2+ potentiation might be occluded by the onset of Zn2+ mediated inhibition. To obviate this problem, all experiments to identify the Zn2+ potentiation binding site were performed using an H107N “background” mutation (hereafter referred to as “reduced inhibition” (RI)). This mutation dramatically attenuated the GlyR sensitivity to Zn2+ inhibition, increasing the Zn2+ IC50 from 15 μm to >3 mm without affecting other macroscopic properties of the receptor, particularly the sensitivity of the receptor to Zn2+ potentiation (see below next paragraph and TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEDose response data for glycine and taurine activation and Zn2+ modulation of wild-type and mutant GlyRs Data represent the mean ± S.E. for n number of experiments.

For this reason it was not used as a general background mutant, in preference to H107N, to disrupt inhibition in this study Open table in a new tab To investigate the high potency Zn2+ potentiation phenomenon on the background of a low sensitivity Zn2+ inhibition component, it was necessary to fully characterize the modulatory curves over a wide concentration range from 0.01 μm to 3 mm. As tricine can only effectively buffer Zn2+ concentrations below 1 μm, it was not included in these comparisons. In accord with previous studies (10Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Suwa H. Saint-Amant L. Triller A. Drapeau P. Legendre P. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the apparent sensitivities to potentiating Zn2+ of the wild-type receptor and RIα1 were lower in the absence of tricine because of the competing background Zn2+ present in the external solution, although the relative EC50 values remained indistinguishable between the two receptors, (Zn2+ EC50 values: α1 wild-type, 0.8 ± 0.3 μm; RIα1, 0.8 ± 0.2 μm; n = 4; p > 0.05) (TABLE ONE). To assess the significance of prospective binding site residues for Zn2+ potentiation, the consequences of their replacement were compared for two GlyR agonists, glycine and taurine. This is necessary, as previously identified residues, which have been postulated to be part of a potentiating Zn2+ binding site, ablated enhancement of responses to one agonist but not the other presumably due to indirect affects on downstream transduction mechanisms (12Lynch J.W. Jacques P. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This emphasized the potential importance of Asp-194, because the Zn2+ potentiation of both glycine- and taurine-activated (EC50) responses was ablated in the RIα1D194A receptor (Fig. 2, A and B). As expected, removing Zn2+ potentiation led to an apparent increase in sensitivity to Zn2+ inhibition, with the IC50 shifting from >3000 to 270 ± 50 μm (n = 3). This is probably a consequence of Zn2+ potentiation and inhibition having overlapping concentration ranges; therefore, by removing potentiation, the inhibitory component appears to have a lower threshold. We cannot discount the possibility that there is some allosteric interaction between the two Zn2+ sites, but this would seem unlikely, as disruption of the inhibitory site does not affect Zn2+ potentiation (29Miller P.S. Beato M. Harvey R.J. Smart T.G. J. Physiol (Lond.). 2005; 566: 657-670Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although not a guarantee of independence, Asp-194 of the putative potentiation site is predicted to reside on the external face of the GlyR N terminus (Fig. 2C), far away from the inhibitory Zn2+ site located on the opposite face of the subunit (30Nevin S.T.

To elucidate which residues were capable of interacting with GlyR α1 Asp-194 in forming the putative Zn2+ potentiation binding site, classical Zn2+ binding residues were selected from motifs predicted to lie structurally close to Asp-194, according to a GlyR homology model based on the acetylcholine-binding protein (Fig. 2C). The selected residues Asp, Cys, Glu, His, and also a Thr (threonine residues have been previously implicated in Zn2+ inhibition of GlyRs) (10Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29Miller P.S. Beato M. Harvey R.J. Smart T.G. J. Physiol (Lond.). 2005; 566: 657-670Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were sequentially substituted with alanine. This strategy identified Glu-192 and His-215 as potential contributors to the Zn2+ potentiation site (Fig. 2C). The mutated GlyR RIα1E192A was unresponsive to Zn2+ potentiation, whereas RIα1H215A exhibited a markedly reduced sensitivity to Zn2+ potentiation by ∼30-fold (Fig. 2, A and B). The EC50 for Zn2+ potentiation of glycine responses was increased from 0.8 ± 0.2 μm for RIα1 to 22 ± 4 μm for RIα1H215A (n = 4; p < 0.05). This reduction in Zn2+ sensitivity was directly comparable with that observed when the GlyR was activated by taurine (EC50, 0.9 ± 0.3 to 21 ± 4 μm, respectively; n = 4; p < 0.05). As previously, removing or reducing Zn2+ potentiation increased the apparent sensitivity to Zn2+ inhibition for both of these mutants. Moreover, substituting other acidic candidate residues for alanines (highlighted in Fig. 2C) had no effect on the potency of Zn2+ potentiation. For all three RI mutants α1E192A, α1D194A, and α1H215A, the maximal responses evoked by the agonists glycine and taurine were indistinguishable from the wild-type receptor, and only RIα1D194A exerted a modest 3-fold increase in the agonist EC50 values (TABLE ONE), suggesting that these mutations selectively affected the Zn2+ potentiation binding site and did not exert a general perturbation on GlyR function. Most importantly, the GlyR homology model (Fig. 2C) predicts that Glu-192, Asp-194, and His-215 reside in close proximity to one another on the outside face of the N-terminal extracellular domain. Typically, functional groups involved in direct coordination of Zn2+ lie within 2–5 Å of the divalent ion (9Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), which is easily accommodated by the predicted distances between the three residues identified on the GlyR model (Fig. 2C). To highlight the localized specific role this domain plays in Zn2+ potentiation, scanning alanine mutagenesis was performed on other residues that lie immediately to either side of the putative Zn2+ binding site and that are also predicted to have externally orientated side chains. These mutated GlyRs (RI mutants α1K190A, α1R196A, α1R213A, and α1E217A) did not affect the glycine, taurine, or Zn2+ EC50 values, the maximal Zn2+ potentiation, or the maximal glycine-activated current (supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, co-expression of a GlyR RIα1E192A with the β subunit did not recover Zn2+-mediated potentiation, suggesting the β subunit is unable to compensate or provide a Zn2+ potentiation site of its own (n = 3) (Fig. 2A). Asymmetry of Function at the Putative Zn2+ Potentiation Binding Site— Demonstrating that this discrete domain is accessible to water is a vital requirement for any dynamic Zn2+ binding site and would strengthen the conclusion that the identified residues may act as direct coordinators of Zn2+. We determined this by individual cysteine substitutions of GlyR α1 Glu-192, Asp-194, and His-215, which were then exposed to the cysteine-modifying reagent MTSEA. If MTSEA covalently binds to the potentiation site, it will replace a Zn2+-coordinating Cys moiety with a positively charged amine group, which should attenuate the Zn2+ potentiation of glycine-activated currents. Pre-application of 3 mm MTSEA for 1 min to the control GlyR RIα1 did not affect Zn2+ potentiation (Fig. 3A) or the glycine EC50 and glycine maximal responses (data not shown). Upon individual replacement of Glu-192, Asp-194, and His-215 with cysteine, GlyRs were generated that retained high sensitivities to Zn2+ potentiation, with EC50 values for Zn2+ within 10-fold of the wild-type receptor (n = 4) (Fig. 3, B–D). This was not surprising, as cysteine is quite capable of coordinating Zn2+. However, following exposure to MTSEA, RIα1D194C and RIα1H215C were rendered unresponsive to Zn2+ potentiation, suggesting that the side chains of both of these residues are surface-exposed and important for Zn2+ potentiation. The sensitivity of RIα1E192C, however, was largely unaffected (n = 4) (Fig. 3, B–D). The binding of MTSEA alone was insufficient to induce potentiation of glycine-activated responses at RIα1D194C or RIα1H215C (Fig. 3, B and C). Surprisingly, MTSEA did increase glycine potency in the absence of Zn2+ for RIα1E192C, potentiating the glycine response by 61 ± 16% (n = 4, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3E). Thus, Glu-192 appears to be accessible to MTSEA, although this covalent modification did not affect the ability of Zn2+ to bind to the receptor. If the carboxyl side chain of Glu-192 was not directly coordinating Zn2+, then perhaps substitution of this residue with alanine would perturb the β-strand backbone, which then would either indirectly disrupt the Zn2+ potentiation site or disrupt a possible contribution of the polar peptide backbone at this locus for Zn2+ coordination. To determine the relevance of the backbone at Glu-192, this residue was mutated to proline (RIα1E192P), an amino acid associated with placing conformational restraints upon peptide backbones (31Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Even though proline cannot coordinate Zn2+, potentiation in this mutated receptor was retained, although at a 5-fold reduced sensitivity (0.8 ± 0.2 μm for RIα1 and 4.2 ± 0.8 μm for RIα1E192P (n = 4, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3F). This suggested that, to retain Zn2+-mediated potentiation, this region must retain a specific conformation of the backbone at Glu-192, which can be accommodated by the"

Here we performed an RNA screen in peripheral mononuclear cells from relapsing-remitting (RR) and primary progressive (PP) MS patients compared with healthy donors (HD) that indicated, among other findings, a role for the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 as a diagnostic marker. Gene expression and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated a significantly lower expression of CX3CR1 in MS patients compared with healthy individuals. The subpopulation of cells responsible for causing this reduced expression of CX3CR1 consisted exclusively of natural killer (NK) cells. Importantly, we found a correlation between disease activity and frequency of CX3CR1-positive NK cells in RRMS patients. These findings emphasize the role of NK cells in the development and course of MS and provide evidence for CX3CR1 expression as a marker for MS patients and disease activity."

Thus, platelet activation plays a major role not only in acute arterial thrombosis but also in the development of chronic vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, which in turn causes thrombosis (1Ruggeri Z.M.

NOS3 is the major isoform known to be expressed in platelets (13Sase K. Michel T. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 2049-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). One of the major functions of NO is to stimulate soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and increase the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) that serves as a secondary messenger regulating the function of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), cGMP-dependent ion channels, and cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases (7Schlossmann J.

High concentrations of NO can also chemically modify (nitrosylation and nitration) proteins and, thus, affect cell functions in a cGMP-independent manner (7Schlossmann J. Feil R. Hofmann F. Ann.

Med. 2003; 35: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It has been a prevailing concept that NO, by elevating intracellular cGMP, inhibits platelet activation (8Ignarro L.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by data that high concentrations of NO donor compounds inhibit platelet activation (17Saxon A.

However, the concept that NO inhibits platelet activation does not fully explain why endogenous platelet NO production is stimulated by platelet agonists (20Malinski T. Radomski M.W. Taha Z.

In this study we show that the major NOS isoform expressed in platelets, NOS3, in fact plays a stimulatory role in low dose agonist-induced platelet activation and promotes in vivo thrombotic response in an injuryinduced arterial thrombosis model. The stimulatory roles of NOS3 are dependent on sGC activation and elevation of cGMP. Furthermore, we found that the NOS3-sGC pathway stimulates aggregation-dependent platelet secretion of granule contents, which is required for the stimulatory roles of the NOS3-sGC pathway in platelet activation. Thus, our data provide an important revision to the current concept of NO signaling in platelets. We propose a new concept that NO plays a biphasic role in platelet activation; low concentrations of NO (such as that produced by platelet NOS3) promote platelet secretion and aggregation, but high concentrations of NO, as previously reported, inhibit platelet activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Soluble GC inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), PKG activator 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-pCPT-cGMP), nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), and thromboxane A2 analog U46619 were from Calbiochem.

Platelets were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of inhibitors or corresponding vehicle controls before the addition of platelet agonists. To investigate the effects of 8-pCPT-cGMP, SNP, or ADP on platelet aggregation, these agents were added to platelets immediately after the addition of the agonist. Platelet secretion was monitored in parallel with platelet aggregation as ATP release in a platelet lumiaggregometer (Chronolog) with the addition of luciferin-luciferase reagent to platelet suspension. Quantification was performed using the ATP standard. Experiments were repeated at least three times. Statistical significance was examined using a paired t test and data from three or more experiments. The amount of total ATP in mouse platelets was determined by measuring the luminescence of Triton X-100 platelet lysates in the presence of luciferin-luciferase reagent in a lumiaggregometer.Measurement of Granule Contents—Mouse platelets were prepared as described for aggregation and secretion studies. The measurement of serotonin was done fluorometrically based on the reaction of serotonin with o-phthalaldehyde, as described previously (24Somerville B. Hinterberger H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1975; 65: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The fluorescence was measured on Wallac1420 Victor multitask reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the excitation wave length at 355 nm and emission wave length at 460 nm. The levels of an α-granule content, VWF, were estimated by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA).Measurement of Platelet cGMP Levels—Washed platelets resuspended in modified Tyrode buffer were preincubated with NOS or sGC inhibitors for 5 min or an equal volume of vehicle control at 37 °C before the addition of different concentrations of thrombin and incubated in a platelet aggregometer with stirring (1000 rpm) for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, the samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was extracted 4 times with 5 volumes of water saturated diethyl ether. The samples were lyophilized, and cGMP concentrations were determined using a cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit from Amersham Biosciences. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between groups was determined by t test.Platelet NOS3 Levels—Washed platelets in Tyrode buffer were solubilized with 50 mm β-octylglucoside, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm E64, pH 7.4. The lysates was incubated with 2′, 5′-ADP-agarose beads, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a NOS3-specific antibody (Transduction laboratories).Bleeding Time— 4–5-Week-old littermates obtained from heterozygous breeding of NOS3+/– mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of avertin. The distal portion of the tail (5 mm) was amputated with a scalpel, and the tail was immersed in 0.15 m NaCl at 37 °C as previously described. Time to stable cessation of the bleeding was defined as the time where no re-bleeding for longer than 60 s was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test.In Vivo Thrombosis— 8–10-Week-old mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. The left carotid artery was isolated from surrounding tissues (25Day S.M. Reeve J.L. Myers D.D. Fay W.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 92: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). MA-0.5PSB nanoprobe (Transonic Systems, Ithaca, NY) was hooked to the artery, and blood flow was monitored with a TS420 flowmeter (Transonic Systems). After stabilization, 1.2 μl of 5% FeCl3 was applied to a filter paper disc (2-mm diameter) that was immediately placed on top of the artery for 3 min. After removing the filter paper, blood flow was monitored continuously until 5 min after occlusion. Time to occlusion was calculated as a difference in time between the removal of the filter paper and stable occlusion (no blood flow for 2 min). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test for the evaluation of differences in median occlusion time (p = 0.04) or by t test for the mean occlusion time after exclusion of the outliers by Dixon outlier range test (3 in NOS3–/– and 2 in NOS3+/+ group) (p = 0.03). Similar results were obtained using both methods.RESULTSNOS3 Knock-out Inhibits Low Dose Agonist-induced Platelet Aggregation in Mouse Platelets—Fig. 1A shows that NOS3 protein is present in wild type mouse platelets but is deficient in NOS3–/– mouse platelets. To investigate the role of NOS3 in platelet activation, washed wild type or NOS3-deficient mouse platelets (26Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laubach V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) suspended in modified Tyrode solution were exposed to platelet agonists. NOS3-deficient platelets showed reduced and unstable platelet aggregation compared with wild type platelets in response to low concentrations of thrombin (at 0.017 units/ml thrombin, p < 0.01, n = 5) (Fig. 1, A and D). When exposed to a sub-threshold concentration of thrombin (0.0125 units/ml), wild type platelets only partially aggregated under the same buffer conditions as above but fully aggregated when a physiological concentration of l-arginine (a substrate for NOS (27Palmer R.M. Ashton D.S. Moncada S. Nature. 1988; 333: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (4094) Google Scholar)) was added, suggesting that l-arginine increased the sensitivity of wild type platelets to thrombin (Fig. 1, B and E). In contrast, the enhancing effect of l-arginine was absent in NOS3-deficient platelets (Fig. 1, B and E). Thus, NO synthesis by NOS3 plays an important role in promoting and stabilizing low dose thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. To examine the effect of NOS3 in platelet activation induced by other agonists, platelets were exposed to the thromboxane A2 analog U46619 or collagen. Similarly, NOS3-deficient platelets showed a reduced aggregation response to low doses of U46619 (Fig. 2A) and collagen (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that NOS3 is important in low dose agonistinduced platelet aggregation.FIGURE 2Stimulatory roles of NOS3 in platelet activation induced by low dose U46619 and collagen. A and B, concomitantly recorded aggregation and secretion of NOS3+/+ and NOS3–/– platelets stimulated with 250 nm (A) or 500 nm U46619 (B). C and D, quantitative data of aggregation (C) and secretion (D) data from three experiments as shown in A and B, respectively.

Note that at higher agonist concentrations secretion is still significantly reduced in NOS3–/– platelets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NOS3 Mediates Dense Granule Secretion—The reduced platelet aggregation in NOS3-deficient platelets was observed at low concentrations of agonists and was characteristic of defects in the secretion-dependent second wave of platelet aggregation (22Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, we also examined if NOS3 knock-out affected platelet secretion using a real time luciferase-luciferin assay of secreted dense granule ATP. Platelet secretion induced by low dose thrombin was significantly reduced in NOS3-deficient platelets (Fig. 1, B and F). Thromboxane A2 induced two waves of platelet secretion as we reported previously (22Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and B). The first wave secretion was aggregation-independent, but the second wave was aggregation-dependent. The aggregation-dependent second wave platelet secretion in response to low dose U46619 was absent in NOS3 knock-out mouse platelets (Fig. 2A). Also, low dose collagen-induced platelet secretion was inhibited in NOS3 knock-out platelets (Fig. 2E). At higher concentrations of thrombin (Fig. 1, C and G), U46619 (Fig. 2, B and D), or collagen (Fig. 2, F and H) platelet secretion was still significantly reduced by NOS3 deficiency, although the remaining secretion appeared to be sufficient to induce the second wave of platelet aggregation. To exclude the possibility that reduced response of NOS3–/– platelets was due to the “exhausted platelets” effect caused by prior platelet activation and secretion during preparation, we determined the total granule contents of wild type control as well as NOS3–/– platelets. The amounts of total ATP were not significantly different between the platelets from wild type and NOS3–/– mice (Fig. 3A). The amounts of dense granule-specific constituent serotonin were also similar between wild type and NOS3-deficient platelets (Fig. 3B). Additionally, platelet lysates contained comparable amounts of α-granule protein, VWF (Fig. 3C), and thrombospondin (data not shown). Therefore, NOS3 knockout platelets carry normal levels of granule cargo but are defective in agonist-stimulated secretion.FIGURE 3Granule contents of wild type and NOS3 knock-out platelets. The total amounts of dense granule contents, ATP (A) and serotonin (B), in NOS3+/+ and NOS3–/– platelets were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” (mean ± S.E., n = 3). C, a representative immunoblot (IB) showing that the total VWF (α granule constituent) levels are similar between NOS3+/+ (+/+) and NOS3–/– (–/–) platelets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus, it appears that NOS3 deficiency primarily affects platelet secretion. Insufficient secretion consequently abolishes or reduces the second wave of platelet aggregation and stability of aggregates. These data explain why NOS3 knock-out only affects platelet aggregation induced by low dose agonists. These data also suggest that NOS3 mediates an important (but not the only) platelet secretion signaling pathway.NOS3 Promotes in Vivo Thrombosis—NOS3–/– mice are hypertensive, suggesting a strong vasoconstrictive effect of NOS3 deficiency. However, despite these strong vascular effects of NOS3 knock-out that favor in vivo hemostasis, we found no statistically significant difference in tail bleeding time between wild type (n = 29) and NOS3 knock-out (n = 33) littermate mice generated by heterozygous breeding (p = 0.5919). Rather, NOS3 knock-out mice showed a tendency of increased re-bleeding after initial unstable cessation of bleeding (data not shown).To determine the in vivo physiological relevance of the role of NOS3 in promoting platelet secretion and aggregation, we compared in vivo thrombosis of wild type and NOS3–/– mice using the FeCl3-injured carotid artery thrombosis model. FeCl3-induced arterial thrombi are known to be platelet-rich thrombi. The time to the formation of stable thrombus in NOS3–/– mice is significantly prolonged compared with wild type mice (p = 0.03, n = 20 for NOS3–/– mice, n = 21 for wild type controls) (Fig. 4). These data suggest that NOS3 participates in thrombus formation and stability in vivo, which is in agreement with the observed stimulatory role of NOS3 in platelet activation.FIGURE 4NOS3 deficiency delays formation of stable occlusive thrombi in vivo. FeCl3-induced carotid artery injury was performed, and time to occlusive thrombosis was recorded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The occlusion time of each mouse is shown as circles (NOS3+/+, n = 21) and triangles (NOS3–/–, n = 20). The bars represent the mean occlusion time ± S.D. (249.8 ± 101.7 s for NOS3+/+ and 327.4 ± 118.4 s for NOS3–/–; p = 0.0299).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of NOS Inhibitors on Human Platelet Secretion and Aggregation—To determine whether NOS is important in human platelet aggregation and secretion, washed human platelets were preincubated with NOS inhibitors l-NAME or NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), then stimulated with low doses of thrombin. Both inhibitors reduced platelet aggregation (Fig. 5, A and E). The inhibitory effect of l-NAME was specific for the biologically relevant l form of the compound, since aggregation was not affected by d-NAME (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, NOS substrate l-arginine significantly enhanced low dose thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 5F). Similar to the results in platelets from NOS3-deficient mice, l-NAME significantly inhibited dense granule release in human platelets (Fig. 5, A and C), whereas l-arginine significantly enhanced platelet secretion (Fig. 5F).FIGURE 5Effects of NOS inhibitors and the NOS substrate l-arginine on human platelet aggregation and secretion.

ADP is known to stimulate integrin activation and amplify platelet aggregation. Thus, it is possible that inhibition of ADP secretion is primarily responsible for the decreased platelet aggregation in NOS inhibitor-treated platelets. Indeed, supplementation with a low concentration of ADP, insufficient to induce aggregation on its own, reversed the inhibitory effects of l-NAME (Fig. 6). Thus, NOS plays an important role in mediating platelet secretion of dense granule contents (mainly ADP), which induces the second wave of platelet aggregation.FIGURE 6The reversal effect of ADP on l-NAME-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation. Washed human platelets preincubated with l-NAME or buffer (Control) were stimulated with a low dose of thrombin. l-NAME-treated platelets were also stimulated with thrombin followed by the addition of a sub-threshold concentration of ADP (500 nm) (in washed platelets ADP is not sufficient to induce platelet secretion or induce aggregation without exogenous fibrinogen).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NOS3 Plays Stimulatory Roles in a cGMP-dependent Manner—Nitric oxide activates sGC, an enzyme that produces cGMP (7Schlossmann J. Feil R. Hofmann F. Ann. Med. 2003; 35: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8Ignarro L.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the role of NOS in platelet activation is upstream of sGC, we examined the effects of NOS inhibitors and NOS3 knock-out on thrombin-stimulated cGMP elevation. Thrombin induced an elevation of cGMP, which was partially but significantly inhibited in NOS3-deficient mouse platelets (Fig. 7A) as well as in l-NAME-treated human platelets (Fig. 7B), suggesting that thrombin induces NOS-dependent elevation of cGMP during platelet activation. These results also suggest that NOS3 is the major but not the only mechanism responsible for agonist-stimulated cGMP elevation. To further determine whether NOS-induced cGMP production was important in the NOS-dependent platelet aggregation, we investigated whether a cell-permeable cGMP analog could reverse the inhibitory effects of l-NAME. The addition of 8-pCPT-cGMP immediately after the addition of thrombin reversed the inhibition of platelet aggregation by l-NAME (Fig. 7C). It is important to note that the effects of cGMP in restoring platelet aggregation in l-NAME-treated platelets could be achieved only if the concentrations of 8-pCPT-cGMP were in a 0.5–10 μm range. Higher concentrations of 8-pCPT-cGMP failed to restore platelet aggregation, which is in agreement with our previous observations that the effects of cGMP on platelet aggregation are biphasic (28Li Z.

Here we show that neutrophils oxidize melatonin to N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) in a reaction that is catalyzed by myeloperoxidase. Production of AFMK was highly dependent on superoxide but not hydrogen peroxide. It did not require hypochlorous acid, singlet oxygen, or hydroxyl radical. Purified myeloperoxidase and a superoxide-generating system oxidized melatonin to AFMK and a dimer. The dimer would result from coupling of melatonin radicals. Oxidation of melatonin was partially inhibited by catalase or superoxide dismutase. Formation of AFMK was almost completely eliminated by superoxide dismutase but weakly inhibited by catalase. In contrast, production of melatonin dimer was enhanced by superoxide dismutase and blocked by catalase. We propose that myeloperoxidase uses superoxide to oxidize melatonin by two distinct pathways. One pathway involves the classical peroxidation mechanism in which hydrogen peroxide is used to oxidize melatonin to radicals. Superoxide adds to these radicals to form an unstable peroxide that decays to AFMK. In the other pathway, myeloperoxidase uses superoxide to insert dioxygen into melatonin to form AFMK. This novel activity expands the types of oxidative reactions myeloperoxidase can catalyze. It should be relevant to the way neutrophils use superoxide to kill bacteria and how they metabolize xenobiotics.

J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 2131-2138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was the first to show that myeloperoxidase has potent antimicrobial activity because of its ability to generate hypochlorous acid. He proposed that myeloperoxidase produces hypochlorous acid inside phagosomes where it reacts with and kills ingested bacteria. However, during microbial killing myeloperoxidase functions in the presence of a high flux of superoxide (7.Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide reacts rapidly with native enzyme to produce oxymyeloperoxidase or compound III (Reaction 5; k5 = 2 × 106 M–1 s–1 (8.Kettle A.J. Sangster D.F. Gebicki J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1985; 228: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Reactions of superoxide with myeloperoxidase are likely to be important in host defense because it has been demonstrated that superoxide enhances myeloperoxidase-dependent killing of Staphylococcus aureus by isolated human neutrophils (10.Hampton M.B.

MPO +O2-→ compound IIIeq 5 Compound III reacts sluggishly with potential substrates (11.Yokota K. Yamazaki I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biophys. 1993; 305: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that compound III potentiates oxygen, like the analogous intermediates of related enzymes such as cytochromes P450 (14.Newcomb M. Hollenberg P.F. Coon M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and nitric-oxide synthase (15.Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). Indeed, reactions of compound III have been invoked to explain the hydroxylation of phenol (16.Subrahmanyam V.V. Kolachana P. Smith M. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1991; 15: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and salicylate (17.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17146-17151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by myeloperoxidase and superoxide. Superoxide also reduces compound II of myeloperoxidase (Reaction 6). This reaction prevents accumulation of compound II and the associated inhibition of hypochlorous acid production (18.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem.

Similarly, reduction of compound II by superoxide boosts the catalytic activity of myeloperoxidase (20.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C.

Catalase, which scavenges hydrogen peroxide, had little effect on formation of the chemiluminescent product. Collectively, these results suggested that myeloperoxidase uses superoxide to oxidize an organic substrate without the need for hydrogen peroxide. In this investigation our main objectives were to identify the chemiluminescent product and to establish whether it is formed by the classical peroxidase cycle (Reactions 1, 3, and 4) or by a novel mechanism that may be relevant to the physiological function of myeloperoxidase. Melatonin, 5-hydroxytryptamine hydrochloride (serotonin), superoxide dismutase, bovine liver catalase, xanthine oxidase, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), dl-methionine, taurine, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), acetaldehyde, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and cytochrome c were purchased from Sigma. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and mannitol were purchased from Merck. All the reagents used for buffers were of analytical grade. Myeloperoxidase was purified from human neutrophils as described previously. Its concentration was determined using its absorption at 430 nm(ϵ430 nm = 89,000 m–1 cm–1 per heme) (24.Kettle A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Its purity index (A430/A280) was at least 0.75. Hydrogen peroxide was prepared by diluting a 30% stock solution (Merck) and calculating its concentration using its absorption at 240 nm (ϵ240 nm = 43.6 m–1 cm–1) (25.Beers R.J. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hypochlorous acid was prepared by diluting a concentrated commercial chlorine bleach solution and calculating its concentration using its absorption at 292 nm (ϵ292 nm = 350 m–1 cm–1) (24.Kettle A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Melatonin stock solutions were prepared by dissolving it in water containing 10% dimethylformamide. The final concentration of dimethylformamide in the assays was 1% or less. These solutions were prepared daily. PMA was dissolved in Me2SO so that its final concentration in neutrophil reactions was 1% v/v. Isolation of Human Neutrophils—Neutrophils were isolated from the blood of healthy donors by Ficoll-Paque centrifugation, dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of red cells (24.Kettle A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After isolation, neutrophils were resuspended in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 10 mm potassium chloride and 140 mm sodium chloride (PBS), plus 1 mm calcium chloride, 0.5 mm magnesium chloride, and 1 mg/ml glucose. This complete buffer is referred to as Buffer A. Determination of Hypochlorous Acid Production by Neutrophils and Purified Myeloperoxidase—Neutrophils (2 × 106 cells/ml) were preincubated at 37 °C in Buffer A with 5 mm taurine and varying concentrations of melatonin for 10 min. When used, superoxide dismutase was present at 20 μg/ml. Cells were stimulated by the addition of 100 ng/ml PMA. After 30 min the reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μg/ml catalase. The neutrophils were then pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant put on ice. Formation of hypochlorous acid was measured by assaying accumulated taurine chloramine (see below). Purified myeloperoxidase (10 nm) was incubated in PBS with 5 mm taurine, and reactions were started by adding 50 μm H2O2. After 5 min, the reactions were stopped by adding catalase (20 μg/ml), and accumulated taurine chloramine was measured. When used, serotonin was present at 5 μm. Taurine chloramine was assayed by adding 200 μl of neutrophil supernatant or the myeloperoxidase reaction system to 50 μl of a solution of containing 10 mm TMB and 100 μm potassium iodide in 50% dimethylformamide and 400 mm acetic acid. Under these conditions taurine chloramine oxidizes TMB to a blue product with an absorbance maximum at 655 nm. 3Dypbukt, J. M., Bishop, C., Brooks, W. M., Thong, B., Eriksson, H., and Kettle, A. J. (2005)Free Radic. Biol. Med., in press. A standard curve was generated by adding reagent hypochlorous acid to PBS containing taurine. The absorbance measurements were made in Spectra Max 190 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Measurements of Superoxide Production by Stimulated Neutrophils—Superoxide production was measured as a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c (26.Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 213-215Google Scholar). Neutrophils (2 × 106 cells/ml) were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in Buffer A containing 20 μg/ml catalase and 100 μm ferricytochrome c. Cells were stimulated by adding 100 ng/ml PMA, and the change in absorbance at 550 nm was measured over the 2nd min of the reaction after an initial lag. Preparation of AFMK Standard—AFMK was prepared by ozone oxidation of melatonin as reported previously (27.Sakiyama F. Masuda N. Nakayama T. Katsuragi Y. Chem. Lett. 1978; 8: 893-986Crossref Google Scholar) and purified by HPLC. The identity of AFMK was confirmed by mass spectrometry ([M + 1]+ m/z = 265) using a Quattro II electrospray ionization-mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) and by fluorescence spectrophotometry (λex = 340 nm; λem = 460 nm) using a Varian F-4500 spectrophotometer (21.de Oliveira S.S. Ximenes V.F. Catalani L.H. Campa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Determination of AFMK Production by Activated Neutrophils—Neutrophils (2 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in Buffer A with 50 μm melatonin. Cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA, and subsequently reactions were stopped by adding 20 μg/ml catalase. Neutrophils were then pelleted by centrifugation and put on ice. Loss of melatonin and formation of AFMK were determined by HPLC after comparing peak areas with standard curves for the purified standards. The HPLC system used was a Shimatzu LC-10A coupled to SPD-10A UV-visible detector and RF535 fluorescence detector. Samples were separated isocratically on a Luna C18 reversed phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) using 1 mm KH2PO4, pH 4.0, acetonitrile (3:1) as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbances were monitored at 254 nm, and fluorescence was recorded using excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 460 nm, respectively. Oxidation of Melatonin by Isolated Myeloperoxidase—Melatonin was incubated in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 10 mm acetaldehyde and varying concentrations of myeloperoxidase and xanthine oxidase. Reactions were started by the addition of xanthine oxidase, and formation of AFMK was measured by HPLC as described above. Oxidation of melatonin was monitored by either following UV absorbance changes or increases in fluorescence (λex = 340; λex = 460). Absorbance changes were recorded on an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer, and fluorescence was measured using a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer. Detection of Melatonin Oxidation Products by LC/MS—The oxidation products of melatonin were separated on a Luna C18 (2.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Report. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) column (particle size 5 μm, 150 × 2.6 mm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using a Surveyor HPLC pump (Thermo Corp., San Jose, CA). The column was maintained at 30 °C. The products were eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using a linear gradient of two solvents: solvent A (5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, 25% acetonitrile) and solvent B (100% acetonitrile). The gradient was as follows: 0–10 min, 0% solvent B; 10–20 min, increased solvent B to 100%; 20–22 min, maintained solvent B at 100%; 22–25 min, decreased solvent B to 0%. The injection volume was 20 μl. The HPLC was coupled to an ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus, Thermo Corp.) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. The mass spectrometer was operated with positive ionization using full scan mode (scan range 100–1000 m/z) and selected ion monitoring. Spray voltage was set at 5.0 kV, and the capillary temperature at 275 °C, and the sheath gas flow was at 26 units (instrument units). Spectral Observations of Myeloperoxidase during Oxidation of Melatonin—The absorption spectrum of myeloperoxidase was monitored during oxidation of melatonin using a Beckman DU 7500 diode array spectrophotometer. Spectra were recorded every 30 s and were the average of 10 scans. Reactions were started by adding either hydrogen peroxide (50 μm) or xanthine oxidase and acetaldehyde (10 mm) to the enzyme and melatonin. Reactions were carried out in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Oxidation of Melatonin by Stimulated Human Neutrophils—Initially we sought to identify the chemiluminescent product formed when neutrophils oxidize melatonin. Neutrophils were incubated with melatonin and stimulated with the phorbol ester PMA to initiate production of superoxide and the release of myeloperoxidase. After 30 min, supernatants were assayed by liquid chromatography with an electrospray positive ionization mass detector to identify products of melatonin oxidation. Melatonin eluted at 17.7 min (m/z 233). Minor and major products eluted before melatonin (Fig. 1A). The minor product that eluted at 12.4 min had an m/z of 249 mass units (Fig. 1B), indicating a likely hydroxylated form of melatonin. The major product that eluted at 14.2 min had an m/z of 265 mass units (Fig. 1C), which corresponds to the mass of AFMK. This peak also co-eluted with authentic AFMK and had the same fluorescence and ultraviolet absorption properties as AFMK (data not shown). Melatonin underwent progressive oxidation over the first 15 min of the reaction after which its rate of loss declined by ∼75%. This slower loss was maintained for the subsequent 45 min of the incubation (Fig. 2). After 1 h ∼40% of the melatonin was oxidized. The time course for AFMK formation mirrored the loss in melatonin. Over the 1-h incubation, 8 μm AFMK was formed, which accounted for about 45% of the oxidized melatonin. The nonstoichiometric yield of AFMK was not due to breakdown of the AFMK because the authentic compound was stable when added to stimulated cells (not shown). Thus, it is likely that melatonin was oxidized to additional products. A range of inhibitors was added to neutrophils to help establish the mechanism by which the cells form AFMK (TABLE ONE). Minimal AFMK was produced when cells were not stimulated or when the NADPH oxidase was inhibited with diphenyliodonium. These results demonstrate that superoxide and/or hydrogen peroxide must be produced by neutrophils before they can oxidize melatonin. Superoxide dismutase was a strong inhibitor of AFMK formation. Catalase showed weak inhibition and blocked the reaction by only 50% at a high concentration of 100 μg/ml. A combination of superoxide dismutase and catalase was no more effective than superoxide dismutase alone. Azide, an inhibitor of myeloperoxidase, decreased production of AFMK by 70%.TABLE ONEInhibitor profile for oxidation of melatonin to AFMK by stimulated human neutrophilsReaction systemAFMK% controlComplete system100-PMA2.5 ± 0.6+Diphenyliodonium0.3+SOD 20 μg/ml13 ± 4+Catalase (20 μg/ml)68 ± 6+Catalase (100 μg/ml)49 ± 2+SOD (20 μg/ml) + catalase (20 μg/ml)13 ± 4+Azide 100 μm30 ± 4+Methionine 1 mm103 ± 2+Me2SO 1 mm105 ± 9+Mannitol108 ± 4 Open table in a new tab Various strong oxidants have been proposed to be produced by neutrophils, including hypochlorous acid, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, and ozone (28.Klebanoff S.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 598-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). All of these oxidants are capable of oxidizing melatonin. Therefore, we added methionine to stimulated neutrophil to scavenge hypochlorous acid, singlet oxygen, and ozone. Me2SO and mannitol were added to intercept the hydroxyl radical. None of these scavengers blocked formation of AFMK. We also determined the effects of superoxide dismutase and catalase on the loss of melatonin. Superoxide dismutase (20 μg/ml) inhibited melatonin loss by 60% (7 ± 2 μm compared with 18 ± 2 μm). Catalase (20 μg/ml) was less effective, inhibiting by 39% (11 ± 2 μm compared with 18 ± 2 μm). These results point to involvement of myeloperoxidase in the oxidation of melatonin to AFMK. However, the requirement for superoxide and the nonessential requirement for hydrogen peroxide suggests an unusual mechanism of oxidation by this heme enzyme. Diffusible oxidants are unlikely to be involved because their scavengers had no effect on formation of AFMK. It is more likely that melatonin reacted directly with myeloperoxidase. Effect of Melatonin on Hypochlorous Acid Production by Neutrophils and Purified Myeloperoxidase—If myeloperoxidase was responsible for oxidizing melatonin, then production of hypochlorous acid by neutrophils is likely to have been affected. Therefore, we measured the effect of melatonin on extracellular production of hypochlorous acid by these cells. With increasing concentration of melatonin there was progressive inhibition of hypochlorous acid production (Fig. 3A). At 50 μm melatonin, little hypochlorous acid was formed. The concentration of melatonin that inhibited hypochlorous acid production by 50% (IC50) was 18 μm. When superoxide dismutase was added to remove superoxide, the IC50 for melatonin dropped to 4 μm. To demonstrate that melatonin inhibits hypochlorous acid production by neutrophils through a direct reaction with myeloperoxidase, we determined the effect of melatonin on the chlorination activity of the isolated enzyme. Melatonin was a potent inhibitor of the initial rate of hypochlorous acid production by myeloperoxidase (Fig. 3B). Serotonin, which readily reduces compound II (29.Dunford H.B. Hsuanyu Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), substantially decreased the ability of melatonin to inhibit the chlorination activity of the enzyme. From these results, we concluded that melatonin reacts with myeloperoxidase released by neutrophils and inhibits production of hypochlorous acid. It is likely to act by competing with chloride and reducing compound I to inactive compound II. This mechanism of inhibition has been shown to occur with tryptophan (30.Kettle A.J. Candaeis L.P. Redox Report. 2000; 5: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and several phenolic and aromatic amines (31.Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1485-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase would enhance the ability of melatonin to inhibit hypochlorous acid production by neutrophils because it would prevent superoxide from recycling compound II (Reaction 6) so that the enzyme would be trapped in this inactive form. In these assays hypochlorous acid was detected by trapping it as taurine chloramine. Therefore, it was possible that melatonin acted by scavenging hypochlorous acid, thereby preventing it from reacting with taurine in the buffer. However, at 100 μm melatonin was unable to prevent reagent hypochlorous acid from reacting with taurine (5 mm) (result not shown). Melatonin up to 100 μm had no effect on superoxide production by neutrophils (result not shown). Oxidation of Melatonin by Purified Myeloperoxidase—To confirm that myeloperoxidase was responsible for the production of AFMK by neutrophils, we determined the ability of the purified enzyme to oxidize melatonin. Xanthine oxidase and acetaldehyde were used as a source of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Initially, we followed oxidation of melatonin by monitoring its difference spectrum (Fig. 4, top). With the complete reaction system there were progressive increases in absorbance peaks with maxima at 242 nm and between 320 and 360 nm. There was also a progressive decline in absorbance at 290 nm. There were minimal absorbance changes in the absence of myeloperoxidase, and no change in the absence of xanthine oxidase. When superoxide dismutase was added to the reaction, oxidation of melatonin still occurred, but the absorbance changes were substantially different. There was a marked decrease in absorbance at 240 nm, smaller changes at 242 and 290 nm, a distinctive peak at 320 nm, and considerably less absorbance above 340 nm (Fig. 4, bottom). These results demonstrate that melatonin is oxidized by myeloperoxidase. Furthermore, the type of products formed in the presence of superoxide and their relative yields are different to those formed in the absence of superoxide. Reaction mixtures were then assayed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry to identify oxidation products of melatonin. As with neutrophils, two UV-absorbing peaks eluted before melatonin. The first was a minor peak and had an m/z of 249 mass units. The major peak had an m/z of 265 mass units and the same fluorescent and UV properties as authentic AFMK (not shown). These products correspond to a hydroxylated form of melatonin and AFMK as found with stimulated neutrophils. We also used selected ion monitoring to determine whether myeloperoxidase oxidizes melatonin to a dimer via the intermediate production of radicals species (Reactions 3 and 4) as it does with other organic substrates such as tyrosine (32.Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke H.L. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expected dimer should have an m/z of 463 mass units when analyzed in the positive ion mode. Indeed, two products eluted with this m/z at about 17.5 and 18 min, indicating the formation of isomeric forms of melatonin dimer (Fig. 5A). The mass spectrum of the product eluting at 18 min gave fragments with m/z of 404.2 and 231 mass units (Fig. 5B), which are consistent with melatonin dimer (Fig. 5C). To determine how myeloperoxidase oxidizes melatonin to AFMK, we undertook inhibitor studies similar to those with neutrophils. Superoxide dismutase blocked AFMK production by greater than 90%, whereas catalase was a poor inhibitor (TABLE TWO). A combination of superoxide dismutase and catalase was no more effective than superoxide dismutase alone. Azide inhibited by 70% but methionine and Me2SO had no effect. These results are very similar to the inhibition pattern observed with neutrophils (TABLE ONE). Thus, myeloperoxidase catalyzed the oxidation of melatonin to AFMK by a reaction that was reliant on superoxide. Although myeloperoxidase used hydrogen peroxide to promote formation of AFMK, the requirement for this substrate was not as great as that for superoxide. Hypochlorous acid, singlet oxygen, and hydroxyl radical could not have been responsible for the production of AFMK because their formation was blocked in the reaction system by excluding chloride and adding methionine or Me2SO.TABLE TWOInhibitor profile for oxidation of melatonin to AFMK by purified myeloperoxidaseReaction systemAFMK% controlComplete system100-MPO15 ± 3-Xanthine0+SOD 20 μg/ml9 ± 2+Catalase 20 μg/ml85 ± 3+Catalase 100 μg/ml68 ± 2+SOD (20 μg/ml) + catalase (20 μg/ml)8 ± 1+Azide 100 μm33 ± 2+Methionine 1 mm90 ± 3+Me2SO 1 mm92 ± 2 Open table in a new tab We also undertook a separate set of experiments to determine the effect of superoxide on the formation of the oxidation products of melatonin. Superoxide could act either by being an essential reactant in the oxidation of melatonin, or it could react with myeloperoxidase to modulate the rates of formation of each of the products. To exclude its effect on the enzyme, we expressed product yields relative to the amount of melatonin oxidized (Fig. 6A). In accord with the data in TABLE TWO, AFMK production was highly reliant on superoxide. In contrast, there was less formation of dimer in the presence of superoxide. The minor hydroxylated product was unaffected by superoxide. These results suggested that superoxide was directly involved in the formation of AFMK. However, it limited formation of melatonin dimer presumably by reacting with melatonin radicals. The inability of catalase to block AFMK production suggests that myeloperoxidase uses superoxide to oxidize melatonin in a reaction that is independent of hydrogen peroxide. However, it is possible that catalase may not be able to completely prevent hydrogen peroxide from reacting with myeloperoxidase. To assess this possibility, we contrasted the effect catalase has on formation of the different products of melatonin oxidation (Fig. 6B). We reasoned that if AFMK production is solely reliant on hydrogen peroxide, then catalase should inhibit its formation to the same extent as that of melatonin dimers. Conversely, if AFMK is formed independently of hydrogen peroxide, catalase should have a greater effect on the production of dimer. In this system, myeloperoxidase oxidized 50 ± 10 μm melatonin, and this was decreased to 13 ± 4 μm in the presence of catalase (74% inhibition). Products were not formed in the absence of myeloperoxidase (Fig. 6B). We found that catalase completely blocked"

Here, we report the identification of sex-determining region Y-box 6 (SOX6), a member of the high mobility group box superfamily of transcription factors, as a co-repressor for pancreatic-duodenal homeobox factor-1 (PDX1). SOX6 mRNA levels were profoundly reduced by both a long term high fat feeding protocol in normal mice and in genetically obese ob/ob mice on a normal chow diet. Interestingly, we show that SOX6 is expressed in adult pancreatic insulin-producing β-cells and that overexpression of SOX6 decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which was accompanied by decreased ATP/ADP ratio, Ca2+ mobilization, proinsulin content, and insulin gene expression. In a complementary fashion, depletion of SOX6 by small interfering RNAs augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in insulinoma mouse MIN6 and rat INS-1E cells. These effects can be explained by our mechanistic studies that show SOX6 acts to suppress PDX1 stimulation of the insulin II promoter through a direct protein/protein interaction. Furthermore, SOX6 retroviral expression decreased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in chromatin from the promoter for the insulin II gene, suggesting that SOX6 may decrease PDX1 stimulation through changes in chromatin structure at specific promoters.

Most affected individuals with insulin resistance do not directly develop diabetes but rather adapt to chronic insulin resistance by expanding pancreatic β-cell mass and/or insulin secretory capacity. To provide the required amount of insulin to maintain normal glucose levels, β-cell mass increases by islet neogenesis, β-cell replication, and β-cell hypertrophy. Pancreatic β-cells eventually fail to compensate for the increased insulin demand created by insulin resistance, leading to type 2 diabetes (1Butler A.E. Janson J. Bonner-Weir S. Ritzel R. Rizza R.A.

To identify additional factors that may contribute to the β-cell adaptation in insulin resistance, we have been characterizing genes that are selectively regulated in the islets of mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) using microarray analysis. Through the evaluation of transcriptional changes by microarray and quantitative real time PCR analyses, we found that one of the sex-determining region Y-box (SOX) transcription factors, SOX6, is markedly down-regulated in the islets of HFD-fed mice and normal chow fed ob/ob mice. Functional analyses with pancreatic β-cell line MIN6 cells revealed that SOX6 reduces GSIS by inhibiting PDX1 transcriptional activity, and our evidence indicates this occurs through a direct interaction between SOX6 and PDX1 proteins. We further show that overexpression of SOX6 results in decreased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, including the NADH dehydrogenase complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, ATP synthase, and a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase. Taken together, the current data suggest that SOX6 is a key protein in the regulation of GSIS and that, together with PDX1, it contributes to the adaptive compensation of β-cells during the progression of obesity-related insulin resistance.

All primer sequences used in this article are available by request. Immunohistochemistry—For light microscopy of paraffin-embedded sections, mouse pancreatic tissues were fixed with 10% (w/v) formalin at room temperature for 20 h. The samples were dehydrated with an alcohol series and embedded in paraffin. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating the sections in an autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min. The sections were incubated with anti-SOX6 antibody (ab-12054) (1:2000 dilution) for 16 h at 4 °C. Bound antibody was detected with the Simple Stain MAX-PO (Multi) reagent (Nichirei), an amino acid polymer coated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fab′) and peroxidase using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) as a substrate, and a hematoxylin counterstain was applied. For double immunofluorescence of adult mouse pancreas, fixed frozen tissues were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4 °C and stained with an anti-SOX6 antibody (ab-12054) (1:2000 dilution) labeled with Zenon Alexa Fluor 594 labeling kit and an anti-insulin or an anti-PDX1 antibody (KR059) (1:2000 dilution). For the detection of PDX1 and insulin, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-guinea pig IgG were used as a secondary antibody, respectively. Control experiments were carried out by omitting the primary antibody. Immunofluorescence was captured with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview FV500, Olympus, Japan). Expression Plasmids—Retroviral expression vectors encoding mouse SOX6 and other SOX genes were generated by PCR and insertion of the cDNAs into the pMX, a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven retroviral expression vector (provided by Dr. Toshio Kitamura at University of Tokyo) (27Kitamura T. Int. J. Hematol. 1998; 67: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCMV-PDX1, a pcDNA3-based plasmid encoding mouse PDX1, was obtained from Dr. Kazuya Yamagata at Osaka University (28Okita K. Yang Q. Yamagata K. Hangenfeldt K.A. Miyagawa J. Kajimoto Y. Nakajima H. Namba M. Wollheim C.B. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and to create pcDNA3-based plasmids encoding mutant PDX1, the deletion sequences of PDX1 (amino acids 1-205, 1-144, and 145-284) were amplified by PCR and ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). To create pcDNA3-based plasmids encoding full-length and mutant SOX6, the full-length and deletion sequences of SOX6 (amino acids 181-827, 263-827, 617-827, 697-827, and 617-696) were generated by PCR amplification and ligated into pcDNA3. pCMV-ΔHMG-SOX6 encodes an internal deletion mutant form of SOX6 in which a 265-amino acid region containing the high mobility group (HMG) domain (amino acids 563-827) was deleted. This was constructed by digestion of pCMV-SOX6 with ApaI to remove the ApaI-ApaI 0.8-kbp fragment containing sequences for the HMG domain, and the plasmid was subsequently religated. A GAL4-PDX1 fusion construct, pBIND-PDX1, and a GAL4-E47 fusion construct, pBIND-E47, were constructed by inserting each cDNA fragment into a polylinker site of pBIND plasmid (Promega), which contains the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein. Reporter Plasmids—pINS(-872)-luc is the rat insulin II gene promoter-luciferase reporter construct that spans -872 to -176 relative to the translation initiation site. pINS(-552)-luc and pINS(-413)-luc are 5′-deletion mutants of pINS(-872)-luc, and each contains a deletion with the 5′-end denoted in parentheses and the same 3′-end point at -176. pINS(-413mut)-luc is identical to pINS(-413)-luc except that the potential SOX binding site (nucleotides -248 to -242) is deleted. pINS(-370mut)-luc was constructed in an identical manner to pINS(-413mut)-luc, but starting from position -370. The 5′-flanking region of the rat insulin II gene (-872 to -176) (29Hwung Y.P. Gu Y.Z. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using a forward primer starting from -872 (5′-TATAGGTACCCCCAACCACTCCAA-3′) and a reverse primer OLi(-176R) (5′-TATACCCGGGGGTTACTGAATCC-3′) and cloned into pGL3-basic. pINS(-552)-luc and pINS(-413)-luc were constructed in a similar manner to pINS(-872)-luc using the respective forward primers starting from the positions -552 (5′-TATAGGTACCTGTGAAACAACAGTTCAAGGG-3′) and -413 (5′-TATAGGTACCTTCATCAGGCCACCCAGGAG-3′) and coupled with a common reverse primer OLi(-176R). p(μE5 + μE2 + μE3)4-luc is a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by a promoter consisting of four tandem copies of the E47-responsive element (5′-ACACCTGCAGCAGCTGGCAGGAAGCAGGTCATGTGGCA-3′) from the mouse IgH promoter (30Libermann T.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5957-5969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was constructed by annealing the oligonucleotides for the top and bottom strands and subsequent ligation into the MluI and BglII sites of pGL3-basic. All plasmid constructs were verified by restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA sequencing. pG5luc is a luciferase reporter construct driven by a promoter consisting of five copies of GAL4 binding sites plus the adenovirus E1B TATA box (Promega).

SOX6 expression was confirmed by QRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. Insulin Secretion, Content, and Adenine Nucleotide Determinations and an Intracellular Ca2+ Assay—The secretory responses to glucose and other secretagogues were tested in MIN6 cells and INS-1E cells between passages 16-35 and 54-95, respectively (31Miyazaki J.

Before the experiments, MIN6 or INS-1E cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH) of the following composition: 129 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 5.0 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.0 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Bovine serum albumin (0.1%) was added as an insulin carrier. Next, cells were washed once with glucose-free KRBH and then incubated for 1 h in KRBH and stimuli as indicated. Incubation was stopped by putting the plates on ice, and the supernatants were collected for insulin secretion. Cellular insulin was extracted with acid-ethanol (0.4 m HCl in 74% ethanol) overnight at 4 °C as described previously (22Fujino T. Asaba H. Kang M.J. Ikeda Y. Sone H. Takada S. Kim D.H. Ioka R.X.

https://openalex.org/W2045263299,"Group III presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) play a central role in regulating presynaptic activity through G-protein effects on ion channels and signal transducing enzymes. Like all Class C G-protein-coupled receptors, mGluR8 has an extended intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD) presumed to allow for modulation of downstream signaling. In a yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult rat brain cDNA library with the CTDs of mGluR8a and 8b (mGluR8-C) as baits, we identified sumo1 and four different components of the sumoylation cascade (ube2a, Pias1, Piasγ, Piasxβ) as interacting proteins. Binding assays using recombinant GST fusion proteins confirmed that Pias1 interacts not only with mGluR8-C but also with all group III mGluR CTDs. Pias1 binding to mGluR8-C required a region N-terminal to a consensus sumoylation motif and was not affected by arginine substitution of the conserved lysine 882 within this motif. Co-transfection of fluorescently tagged mGluR8a-C, sumo1, and enzymes of the sumoylation cascade into HEK293 cells showed that mGluR8a-C can be sumoylated in vivo. Arginine substitution of lysine 882 within the consensus sumoylation motif, but not other conserved lysines within the CTD, abolished in vivo sumoylation. Our results are consistent with post-translational sumoylation providing a novel mechanism of group III mGluR regulation.

At least eight different mGluR isoforms have been identified and classified into three subgroups based on sequence homology, downstream effectors, and agonist specificity. Group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -6, -7, and -8) are specifically activated by l(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (l-AP4), negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase and, apart from mGluR6, exclusively localized presynaptically. Aside from mGluR6, which is only found in the retina, group III mGluRs are expressed throughout the brain. Compared with other mGluRs, mGluR8 expression is regionally restricted, with highest mRNA levels detected in olfactory bulb, pontine gray, thalamus, and mamillary body (7.Duvoisin R.M. Zhang C.

Sumo1 (small ubiqitin-related modifier 1) is a 101-amino acid protein that can be covalently linked to the ϵ-amino group of lysine side chains of target proteins. This post-translational modification is catalyzed by an enzymatic cascade termed “sumoylation pathway,” which requires an activation enzyme (E1), conjugase (E2), and for most substrates, ligase (E3) (14.Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 15.Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem.

Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). This pathway is mechanistically but not functionally related to ubiquitination. Whereas ubiquitination destines target proteins to internalization and degradation, sumoylation can have such diverse effects as promoting transport between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, protection from ubiquitination (15.Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and regulation of protein-protein interactions (17.Song J.

Members of the Pias (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family promote the conjugation of sumo1 to different proteins and have been classified as E3 protein ligases (18.Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). They have been found to interact with several targets, among them nuclear proteins and steroid receptors (19.Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Pias proteins contain an N-terminal SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and Pias) domain consisting of a four helix bundle that is responsible for binding to A/T-rich DNA oligomers and p53 tumor suppressor protein (20.Okubo S. Hara F. Tsuchida Y. Shimotakahara S. Suzuki S. Hatanaka H. Yokoyama S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Shindo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31455-31461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The sumo ligase activity of Pias family proteins (but not the Ran-binding protein 2 (RanBP2) sumo1 E3 ligase) requires a conserved C-terminal zinc finger domain, which is related to the essential ring finger motif of many ubiquitin ligases (21.Schmidt D. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Known sumo targets are predominantly nuclear proteins, like transcription factors, nuclear body proteins, and viral and nuclear pore complex components, although soluble signal transduction proteins (MAPK kinase 1 (Mek1), calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII)) and other cytoplasmic proteins (e.g. yeast septins) have also been identified (22.Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Subcellularly, the largest fraction of sumo conjugates localizes to nuclear speckles and the nuclear envelope (23.Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Sumoylation of plasma membrane proteins has rarely been reported and can have bimodal effects on trafficking within the same protein family: overexpression of the E2 conjugase ubc9 results in a 4-fold increase of GLUT4 at the membrane, whereas levels of GLUT1 are decreased (24.Lalioti V.S.

Recently, sumoylation has been found to silence the plasma membrane leak potassium channel K2P1 (26.Rajan S. Plant L.D. Rabin M.L. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 2005; 121: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no plasma membrane receptors have yet been identified as targets of the sumoylation machinery. Here we report an interaction of family C GPCRs, namely group III mGluRs, with the E3 ligase Pias1. In addition, we provide evidence that the CTD of mGluR8a can undergo in vivo sumoylation on a consensus site in HEK cells. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen and Yeast Mating—Yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out using the DupLEX-A system (OriGene Tech. Inc., Rockville, MD) as described previously (27.El Far O. Airas J. Wischmeyer E. Nehring R.B. Karschin A. Betz H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4215-4221PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA fragments encoding the CTDs of mouse mGluR8a (mGluR8a-C) and mGluR8b (mGluR8b-C) were generated by PCR, cloned into pGilda and used as baits to screen an adult rat brain cDNA library cloned into pJG4–5, according to the user's manual (Version 1.2). Yeast strain EGY48 was transformed using lithium acetate, and protein expression was induced by 1.5% (w/v) galactose. For screening with the mGluR8a and mGluR8b baits, 3 × 106 and 1.25 × 106 independent recombinants were examined, and 1,385 and 934 clones, respectively, were identified to be positive by Leu– auxotrophy and β-galactosidase expression. Yeast mating was performed with yeast strains EGY48 and RFY206, using the same selection conditions as in the two-hybrid screen. After examining insert sizes and HaeIII digestion patterns, ∼100 candidate clones identified with each bait were selected for sequencing. Expression Constructs—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of the CTDs of mGluR4, -6, -7a, -7b, -8a, and -8b, and the mGluR7a truncations GST-7a-N38 and GST-7a-C27 have been described previously (28.El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Airas J.M. O'Connor V. Boehm S. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30662-30669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The EcoRI- and SalI-flanked truncated mGluR8a tail constructs GST-8a-N24 and GST-8a-C44 were generated by standard PCR and inserted into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). A site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) was used to introduce lysine to arginine substitutions. Flanking EcoRI and SalI sites were used to shuttle inserts between pGEX-5X-1 and pEGFP-C2 to generate bacterial or mammalian fusion proteins. MBP-ube2a and MBP-Piasγ were generated by transferring in-frame inserts between EcoRI and XhoI sites from the identified clones to pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). The ube2a fragment contained the full-length coding sequence including 69 bp of the 5′-untranslated region. The Piasγ fragment encoded the 157 C-terminal amino acids of rat Piasγ. MBP-Pias1, GFP-Pias1, and CFP-Pias1 were constructed by transferring the full-length Pias1 cDNA from pCMV5-FLAG-Pias1 (gift from Dr. Shuai Ke, University of California, Los Angeles) into pMAL-c2, pEGFP-C2, and pECFP-C1 (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. BamHI and HindIII flanked full-length cDNAs of ube2a and sumo1 were generated by PCR and subcloned into the BglII and Hind III sites of pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) and pECFP-C1, respectively. Full-length His6-aos1 and uba2 expression constructs were similarly generated by PCR using pET28a-His6-aos1 and pET11d-uba2 (gifts from Dr. Frauke Melchior, University of Goettingen, Germany), respectively, as templates, and subcloned between the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1, respectively. Protein Expression and Binding Studies—Expression of GST and MBP fusion proteins was performed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Stratagene) as described (28.El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Airas J.M.

Bacteria were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing the protease inhibitor mixture CompleteTM (Roche Diagnostics) via passage through a French press. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. GFP, CFP, or YFP fusion proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells and processed as described (27.El Far O. Airas J. Wischmeyer E. Nehring R.B. Karschin A. Betz H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4215-4221PubMed Google Scholar). Protein expression in the bacterial lysates and cell homogenates was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-GST, anti-MBP, and anti-GFP antibodies. For pull-down assays, the lysates were incubated with 25 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) preloaded with GST-mGluR-C in incubation buffer (PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). After 2 h of rotary agitation, beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with incubation buffer. After elution with SDS sample buffer, eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-MBP (New England Biolabs) or polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP (Clontech). About one-fifth of the glutathione-agarose beads preloaded with GST-mGluR-C were loaded onto another gel and used to evaluate the amount of GST fusion protein bound. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany), proteins were stained for 4 min with 2% (w/v) Ponceau in 3% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Sumo1 Conjugation in Vivo—pEGFP-mGluR8a-C, or mutants thereof, was co-transfected with empty vector pEGFP-C2, or with different combinations of pECFP-sumo1, pcDNA3-His6-aos1, pcDNA3.1-uba2, pEYFP-ube2a, and pEGFP-Pias1 into 60% confluent HEK293 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (27.El Far O. Airas J. Wischmeyer E. Nehring R.B. Karschin A. Betz H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4215-4221PubMed Google Scholar), using 5 μg of each DNA per 10-cm dish. Two days after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and harvested in 2× sample buffer (20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 4% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol in 0.125 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8). Western blotting was performed after 8% SDS-PAGE using guinea pig anti-mGluR8a-C (11.Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor P.J. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or monoclonal mouse anti-sumo1 (anti-Sentrin1, Zytomed, Berlin, Germany). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen and Yeast Mating—To identify mGluR8-C-interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult rat brain cDNA library, using the entire CTD coding regions of the mGluR8a and mGluR8b cDNAs as baits. Twelve and thirteen clones encoding the C-terminal region of protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (Pias1) were identified with mGluR8a-C and 8b-C, respectively (TABLE ONE). The shortest cDNA fragment isolated for Pias1 comprised only the coding region for amino acids 514–721, which corresponds to the extreme C terminus not including the zinc finger domain. Additionally, 12 (mGluR8a) and 9 (mGluR8b) clones were found for the Msx-interacting zinc finger (Miz1), which encodes the C terminus of mammalian Piasxβ. Nine (mGluR8a) and three (mGluR8b) clones contained the entire coding sequence for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2a (ube2a), the rat homologue of the yeast sumo-specific E2-conjugating enzyme (ubc9). All clones were in-frame with the B42 activation domain, and interactions were confirmed in yeast mating assays using the respective CTDs of mGluR8 (TABLE ONE). For mGluR8b, we isolated three additional clones, two encoding ubiquitin-like 1 (sumo1), and one encoding a C-terminal fragment of Piasγ. These clones were tested in yeast mating experiments and gave positive signals also with mGluR8a-C (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEcDNAs identified by yeast two-hybrid screening using mGluR8a-C and mGluR8b-C as baitsPrey (GenBank™ no.)Predicted no. aa of full-length proteinFragments identifiedNumber of clones identified 8a/8bYeast mating 8a/8baaPias1 (62653796)1-721209-72112/13+/+283-721319-721412-721514-721Piasxβ (Miz1) (16758049)1-572312-57212/9+/+Ube2a (ubc9) (4079642)1-1581-1589/3+/+Sumol (ubl1, sentrin) (57528278)1-1016-1010/2+/+Piasγ (62651709)1-507351-5070/1+/+ Open table in a new tab GST-mGluR8-C Interacts with MBP-Pias1—To biochemically confirm the results of the yeast two-hybrid screen, we expressed candidate-interacting proteins, except Piasxβ, in bacteria as MBP fusion proteins and used them with GST-mGluR8-C fusion proteins in pull-down assays (Fig. 1). Batch adsorption onto glutathione-agarose, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an antibody against MBP revealed that the MBP-Pias1 could be affinity-purified on GST-mGluR8b-C and, to a lesser extent, on GST-mGluR8a-C, but not on GST alone. Normalization of the GST fusion protein levels retained on the beads by Ponceau staining of the nitrocellulose membrane (data not shown) revealed that the amount of GST-mGluR8a-C adsorbed onto the agarose beads was only about 25% of that of mGluR8b-C. A comparatively weak specific interaction was also detected for the MBP fusion of the C-terminal region of Piasγ, which similarly bound to both mGluR8-C isoforms. GST alone failed to bind MBP and all MBP fusion proteins tested. MBP-ube2a did not exhibit detectable binding to any of the GST-mGluR8-C termini. It is, however, important to note that rather stringent washing conditions had to be used in these pull-down assays because of high unspecific binding of MBP (data not shown). GFP-Pias1 Interacts with All Group III mGluRs—Based on its frequent detection in the yeast two-hybrid screen, we next focused on Pias1. To examine whether binding of Pias1 is shared by other group III or even group II mGluR members, we performed binary yeast two-hybrid assays with the C-terminal coding fragment of the Pias1 cDNA and group II/III mGluR-CTDs (except mGluR7b-C and mGluR8b-C; Fig. 2A). In these assays, mGluR8a-C showed the strongest interaction, followed by mGluR7a-C and then mGluR6-C/mGluR4-C. In contrast, neither mGluR2-C nor mGluR3-C interacted with Pias1. Presuming that Pias1 binds in its function as E3 ligase in sumoylation, we compared group II (29.Tanabe Y. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) and group III (28.El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Airas J.M. O'Connor V. Boehm S. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30662-30669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) CTD sequences for the presence of candidate acceptor lysine residues (Fig. 2A). Notably, the group II mGluR C termini contain only a single lysine (mGluR2, Lys823; mGluR3, Lys832), just C-terminal of the end of the transmembrane domain 7. Group III mGluRs do not carry a lysine at this position but display multiple lysine side chains throughout their CTDs. Next, we investigated whether GFP-Pias1 generated in mammalian cells binds other group III mGluR C termini and tested its interaction with the respective GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2B). Whereas GST failed to bind GFP-Pias1 and conversely GFP did not interact with GST-mGluR7a-C (data not shown), all group III mGluR C termini showed some interaction. Strongest binding was seen with mGluR7a-C, mGluR4-C, and mGluR6-C. The weak band recovered with GST-mGluR8a could be attributed to substantially less GST fusion protein being retained on the agarose beads; a sequential Western blot with anti-GST antibody produced only a signal corresponding to ∼25% of the other GST fusion proteins used in this experiment (data not shown). In conclusion, all group III mGluR-CTDs were able to bind GFP-Pias1. The same assay was also used to examine whether the different components of the sumoylation pathway found in the yeast two-hybrid screen can directly interact with GST-mGluR8a-C. For these experiments, we now used cDNA constructs encoding full-length Pias1, ube2a, and sumo1. CFP-sumo1, YFP-ube2a, and GFP-Pias1 all were expressed in HEK293 cells, and Triton X-100 extracts of the transfected cells were used in binding assays (Fig. 3). Interaction could be confirmed for mGluR8a-C and GFP-Pias1, whereas only very little or no YFP-ube2a was recovered in the bound protein fraction. GFP alone did not bind to GST-mGluR8a-C. In contrast to the results obtained in the original two-hybrid screen, GST-mGluR8a failed to bind CFP-sumo1 (molecular mass ∼40 kDa) under our assay conditions but enriched two high molecular mass (≥90 kDa) sumo-conjugated proteins from the HEK cell lysates. We did not try to disclose the identity of these proteins but an unbiased mass spectrometry-based analysis of sumo-conjugated HEK cell proteins has identified several candidates in the respective molecular mass range (30.Zhao Y. Kwon S.W. Anselmo A. Kaur K. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20999-21002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Together these results are consistent with Pias1 representing the primary group III mGluR binding partner of the sumoylation machinery. Mapping of the Pias1 Interaction Domain of mGluR7a-C and mGluR8a-C—To determine which domains of mGluR7a-C and mGluR8a-C interact with Pias1, we tested binding of mammalian expressed CFP-Pias1 to respective truncated GST fusion proteins (Fig. 4B). A schematic drawing of the truncation mutants used is shown in Fig. 4A. The mGluR7a-C truncation constructs did not overlap whereas those for mGluR8a-C overlapped by three amino acids. Also, the positions of the truncations were different in the respective CTDs: for mGluR7a-C, GST-mGluR7a-N38 ends, and GST-mGluR7a-C27 starts, just before the conserved lysine. For mGluR8a-C, GST-mGluR8a-N24 only included the proximal signal transduction domain with the G-protein βγ and Ca2+/calmodulin binding sites (28.El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Airas J.M. O'Connor V. Boehm S. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30662-30669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas GST-mGluR8a-C44 contained all conserved lysines outside of this signaling domain. GST fusion protein levels were normalized and tested semiquantitatively for the amount retained on beads (Ponceau stain on nitrocellulose membrane, Fig. 4B, lower panel). Lower protein levels were seen particularly for GST-mGluR7a-N38, GST-mGluR7a-K889R, GST-mGluR8a-C, and mGluR8a-K882R. Binding of CFP-Pias1 was found with GST-mGluR7a-N38 and mGluR8a-C44, whereas the complementary truncations GST-mGluR7a-C27 and GST-mGluR8a-N24 failed to interact. In sequence alignments (Figs. 2A and 4A), mGluR7a-N38 and mGluR8a-C44 overlap by 17 amino acids but are only identical in the last six residues preceding the consensus sumoylation motif (sequence DRPNGE; see amino acids 875–880 of mGluR8a). We therefore deduce that these residues are important for Pias1 recruitment to group III mGluRs. In Vivo Sumoylation of mGluR8a-C Requires Lys882—To demonstrate that mGluR8a-C is sumoylated in vivo, GFP-mGluR8a-C and the following tagged components of the sumoylation pathway were co-expressed in HEK293 cells: CFP-sumo1, E1 components aos1/uba2, YFP-ube2a, and GFP-Pias1. After detergent extraction of the transfected cells in the presence of protease inhibitors and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, which blocks sumo1-deconjugating enzymes (31.Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Saitoh H. Kawakami T. Omata M. Chung C.H. Kimura M. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31131-31134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted with an antibody directed against the mGluR8 CTD. In the transfected, but not in untransfected cells, a significant fraction of mGluR8a-C immunoreactivity displayed a size shift to ∼70 kDa, consistent with the addition of a single CFP-sumo1 molecule (Fig. 5A). Parallel Western blotting with an anti-sumo antibody confirmed that the 70-kDa band was indeed sumoylated (Fig. 5B). We also examined whether co-transfection of all six cDNAs was necessary for this sumoylation and found that only ube2a was not endogenously expressed at levels high enough to yield visible sumoylation of the overexpressed mGluR8a-C (data not shown). Inclusion of the E1 enzyme (aos1/uba2) proved to be second most important, whereas overexpression of Pias1 appeared not to be required and hence was omitted from subsequent transfections. Substitutions of target lysines by equally charged arginines are commonly used to identify motifs for sumoylation, whereas corresponding alanine substitutions have been shown to result in reduced binding of E2 to substrate proteins like Ran GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP1) (32.Sampson D.A. Wang M. Matunis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Here, sumoylation of mGluR8a-C was also abolished upon replacing specific lysines by arginines within the CTD (for positions of lysine substitutions, see Fig. 4A). Substitutions were selected based on two criteria: location within C44 of mGluR8a and conservation in both, mGluR8a and 8b. We found that single or triple arginine substitutions, including Lys882, abolished sumo-conjugation, whereas single or combined substitution of Lys868 and Lys872 did not interfere with this modification (Fig. 5A). Notably, sumo-conjugation did not on occur the Lys868 neighboring lysines or Lys872 when the consensus sumoylation lysine 882 had been substituted. Also, K882R substitution or the triple mutation K868R/K872R/K882R did not lead to sumoylation of one of the remaining four lysines in the CTD of mGluR8a (Fig. 5A). Thus, in transfected cells, sumoylation of mGluR8a-C occurs specifically at lysine 882 located within the conserved consensus sumoylation motif. Notably, arginine substitution of Lys882 in mGluR8a-C and of the homologous lysine Lys889 in mGluR7a-C did not affect binding of CFP-Pias1 in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 4B). This further confirms that the interaction of Pias1 with mGluRs does not depend on an intact sumoylation consensus motif in the CTD. In th"

Plasma cell membrane glycoprotein-1 and tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase were reported to be antagonistic regulators of mineralization toward inorganic pyrophosphate formation (by plasma cell membrane glycoprotein-1) and degradation (by tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase) under physiological conditions. In addition, they possess broad overlapping enzymatic functions. Therefore, we examined the roles of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase within matrix vesicles isolated from femurs of 17-day-old chick embryos, under conditions where these both antagonistic and overlapping functions could be evidenced. Addition of 25 μm ATP significantly increased duration of mineralization process mediated by matrix vesicles, while supplementation of mineralization medium with levamisole, an alkaline phosphatase inhibitor, reduces the ATP-induced retardation of mineral formation. Phosphodiesterase activity of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase for bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate was confirmed, the rate of this phosphodiesterase activity is in the same range as that of phosphomonoesterase activity for p-nitrophenyl phosphate under physiological pH. In addition, tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase at pH 7.4 can hydrolyze ADPR. On the basis of these observations, it can be concluded that tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, acting as a phosphomonoesterase, could hydrolyze free phosphate esters such as pyrophosphate and ATP, while as phosphodiesterase could contribute, together with plasma cell membrane glycoprotein-1, in the production of pyrophosphate from ATP.

On the basis of these observations, it can be concluded that tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, acting as a phosphomonoesterase, could hydrolyze free phosphate esters such as pyrophosphate and ATP, while as phosphodiesterase could contribute, together with plasma cell membrane glycoprotein-1, in the production of pyrophosphate from ATP.

The alkaline phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.1) are usually described as exo-phosphomonoesterases (exo-PME), which catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphoryl group of phosphomonoesters at alkaline pH, by forming Pi and alcohol (8Hull W.E. Halford S.E. Gutfreund H. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1547-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It has been reported that ATP is hydrolyzed by human alkaline phosphatase by stepwise production of Pi (9Moss D.W. Walli A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 191: 476-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TNAP is a metalloenzyme with three divalent cations (two Zn2+ and one Mg2+) and a serine residue in the active site (10Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). It has been classified into a superfamily of phospho-/sulfo-coordinating enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters, diesters, triesters, and sulfate esters (11Strater N. Lipscomb W.N.

Mammalian plasma cell membrane glycoprotein-1 (PC-1, phosphodiesterase 1: EC 3.1.4.1/nucleotide pyrophosphatase: EC 3.6.1.9) is the type II transmembrane protein with a small intracellular and a large extracellular domain comprising the catalytic site (16Goding J.W.

Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 285-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The PC-1 is a metalloenzyme with two divalent cations (Mn2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, or Mg2+) and a threonine residue in the active site (12Wilcox D.E. Chem.

Stalmans W. Bollen M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). By comparing the structural model of the catalytic core of PC-1 with that of TNAP, it has been shown that the ion binding and active site residues in PC-1 and TNAP are superimposed (15Gijsbers R. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1361-1368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, the threonine residue at catalytic site of PC-1 coincides with the serine residue at catalytic site of TNAP (15Gijsbers R. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1361-1368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggesting a similar catalytic mechanism for both types of enzymes. Because at physiological pH, TNAP hydrolyzes PPi, and PC-1 produces PPi from nucleotide triphosphates, the two enzymes have been recognized as antagonistic regulators of the mineralization process by modulating the extracellular PPi concentration (Fig. 1) (6Hessle H. Johnson K.A. Anderson H.C. Narisawa S. Sali A. Goding J.W. Terkeltaub R. Millan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 21Johnson K.A.

Alkaline phosphatases and PC-1, which belong to the same phospho-/sulfo-coordinating metalloenzyme superfamily, exhibit a broad substrate specificity. PC-1 is able to catalyze the reactions involving both phosphate diesters and phosphate monoesters (15Gijsbers R. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1361-1368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Clair T. Lee H.Y. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol.

In the case of alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli, the enzyme exhibits a phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity and a low sulfatase activity in addition to its well established PME activity (14O'Brien P.J. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5691-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase has been suggested to hydrolyze P3-[1-(2-nitrophenyl)]-ethyl ester of ATP, an analogue of nucleotide without free phosphate monoester (24Zhang L. Buchet R. Azzar G. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3873-3881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although previous reports demonstrated that mammalian alkaline phosphatases can act as type I phosphodiesterases (9Moss D.W. Walli A.K. Biochim. Biophys.

Chondrocytes in the growth plate export continually nucleotides (ATP/UTP) that may regulate cell maturation, energy metabolism and matrix mineralization (30Hatori M. Teixeira C.C. Debolt K.

The nucleotide concentration of the extracellular fluid aspirated from the hypertrophic zone of rat calcifying epiphyseal cartilage was reported to reach 1-2 mm (34Bowler W.B. Tattersall J.A. Hussein R. Dixon C.J. Cobbold, P.H. Gallagher, J.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 524Google Scholar). Nucleotides (ATP/UTP) are also released both by non-stimulated (35Howell D.S. Pita J.C.

Res. 2005; 20: 41-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in response to mechanical stimulus. The measured amount of secreted ATP in solution by murine osteoblast-like cell in response to shear was in the order of 100 nm, however this does not accurately show the local ATP concentration at the cell surface immediately on its release (38Genetos D.C. Geist D.J. Liu D. Donahue H.J. Duncan R.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 41-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the osteoblasts have been shown to express an membrane-bound ecto-nucleoside diphosphokinase (ecto-NDPK), which allows the ADP⇆ATP conversion in extracellular calcification medium (35Howell D.S. Pita J.C. Marquez J.F. Madruga J.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1968; 47: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because of the physiological role of extracellular ATP in bone formation and remodeling, and its persisting presence in the calcification environment, ATP is expected to be one of the main sources of both Pi and PPi, which play opposite roles in bone formation and remodeling. The purpose of the present work was to examine the roles of TNAP during the ATP-initiated deposition of calcium phosphate complexes by MVs isolated from femurs of 17-day-old chick embryos. We found that chicken TNAP possesses not only a PME activity that hydrolyzes PPi, but also a PDE activity that may delay the mineralization process by producing PPi from ATP. Extraction of MVs—Collagenase-released MV were isolated from bone and epiphyseal cartilage slices of 17-day-old chicken embryos according to Wu et al. (39Wu L.N. Yoshimori T. Genge B.R. Sauer G.R. Kirsch T. Ishikawa Y. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25084-25094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Slices of bone tissues were digested at 37 °C for 20 min in a synthetic cartilage lymph (SCL) containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 0.1% trypsin (from bovine pancreas, ICN Biomedicals Inc.). SCL contained 1.42 mm Pi, 104.5 mm Na+, 133.5 mm Cl-, 63.5 mm sucrose, 16.5 mm TES, 12.7 mm K+, 5.55 mmd-glucose, 1.83 mm HCO3-, 0.57 mm Mg2+, and 0.57 mm SO42-. Then, the trypsin solution was discarded. Slices of bone tissues were rinsed with SCL 5-6 times to completely remove trypsin. Afterward, the slices were digested at 37 °C for 3-3.5 h in an SCL solution containing 1 mm Ca2+ and collagenase (type I, ICN Biomedicals Inc., 200 units/g of tissue with a volume of 4 ml/g of tissue) at 37 °C for 3-3.5 h. The partially digested tissue was vortexed, and the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was discarded, and the suspension was centrifuged again at 80,000 × g for 1 h. The MV pellet was suspended as a stock suspension of 1.0 mg of vesicle protein/ml in SCL at 4 °C for further use. Protein concentration in the vesicles was determined by the method of Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy of MVs—A drop of the suspension of MVs diluted to 25 μg of MV protein/ml was transferred to carbon-coated grids. Before the complete drying of MV sample, the grid was recovered by an aliquot of 2% uranyl acetate solution according to the negative staining method (41Brennes S. Horne R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 42Harris P.D. Cable J. Tinsley R.C. Parasitol. Res. 1997; 83: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and dried. The grids were observed by means of an electron microscope Philips CM140 at 80 kV accelerating voltage. Mineralization Assay—The light scattering method (43Brecevic L. Furedi-Milhofer H. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1972; 10: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was employed for real time measurement of mineral formation by MV. MVs were suspended in SCL to a final concentration of 10 μg of MV protein/ml, different ions (Ca2+, Pi, PPi), substrates (ATP, ADP, AMP) or inhibitors (levamisole) were added into the SCL medium. Their respective concentrations are indicated in the figure legends. The samples were then incubated at 37 °C, and the absorbances read at 340 nm at 15-min intervals. Treatment of MVs by Phosphatidylinositol Phospholipase C (PI-PLC)—MVs (0.3-0.5 mg of MV protein/ml) were incubated in SCL containing 1-2 units/ml PI-PLC overnight at 37 °C under gentle vortexing. The supernatant (sMV) and the pellet (pMV) were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pMV was suspended in SCL in the same volume as before centrifugation. SDS-PAGE and Visualization of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity by BCIP-NBT Method—Electrophoresis was performed in 7.5% or 12% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, according to Laemmli (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Under mild denaturing conditions, which can preserve the activity of alkaline phosphatase, the samples were prepared in Tris buffer containing 2% SDS, but without addition of β-mercaptoethanol and without heating before migration. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. After SDS-PAGE under mild denaturing conditions, gels were incubated in a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), and 0.24 mm bromochloro-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) until the bands of sky blue color were clearly visible. The BCIP-NBT revealed specifically active alkaline phosphatase. Extraction of Alkaline Phosphatase from an SDS-PAGE Gel—After SDS-PAGE in 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel under mild denaturing conditions, the small bands containing active alkaline phosphatase, as visualized by BCIP-NBT, were cut to extract the enzyme. Briefly, the sliced gel was crushed and vigorously vortexed in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm Mg2+, and 0.5 μm Zn2+ to resolubilize TNAP. The supernatant was separated from the gel by centrifugation, and then washed with the same buffer by filtering 5-6 times the TNAP solution through Centricon-30 (Amicon) to remove the detergent and to restore TNAP activity. PME Activity Assay—PME activity of alkaline phosphatase was measured spectrophotometrically using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as substrate (45Cyboron G.W. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7262-7268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 5-μl aliquot was added to 1 ml of the reactive solution containing 25 mm piperazine, 25 mm glycylglycine and 10 mmpNPP at pH 10.4 or at pH 7.4. The change in absorbance of released p-nitrophenolate chromophore at 37 °C was monitored at 420 nm (ϵ = 18.5 cm-1·mm-1 at pH 10.4, ϵ = 9.2 cm-1·mm-1 at pH 7.4). One unit of the alkaline phosphatase PME activity was defined as the amount of enzyme hydrolyzing 1 μmol of pNPP per min under described conditions. PDE Activity Assay—PDE activity was measured spectrophotometrically using bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (bis-pNPP) as substrate. A 5-μl aliquot was added to 1 ml of the reactive solution containing 25 mm piperazine, 25 mm glycylglycine, and 2 mm bis-pNPP at pH ranging from 7.0 to 10.5. The changes in absorbance because of the released p-nitrophenolate chromophore at 37 °C were monitored at 420 nm. The activities determined at different pH were calculated using the absorbance coefficients (ϵ) of p-nitrophenolate at different pH. One unit of the PDE activity was defined as the amount of enzyme hydrolyzing 1 μmol of bis-pNPP per min under described conditions. Determination of Hydrolysis of Sodium ADPR—(a) The kinetics of the ADPR (Sigma) hydrolysis by MVs were determined in 200 μl of the reactive buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 μm Zn2+, 10 mm Mg2+ at different ADPR concentration ranging from 0.2 mm to 2 mm.(b) The pH effect on the hydrolysis of ADPR by MV was performed in 200 μl of piperazine/glycylglycine buffer (25 mm/25 mm) containing 0.5 μm Zn2+, 10 mm Mg2+, and 1 mm ADPR at different pH ranging from 7.0 to 10.5. After addition of enzyme, solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 6-10 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of an 800-μl reactive solution containing 0.5% ammonium molybdate, 2% H2SO4, and 0.6 m ascorbic acid. After 1-2 h incubation at 37 °C, the Pi levels were determined by measuring absorbance of assay solution at 740 nm according to Murphy and Riley (46Murphy J. Riley J.P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1962; 27: 31-36Crossref Scopus (15759) Google Scholar). One unit of the ADPR hydrolysis activity was defined as the amount of enzyme hydrolyzing 1 μmol of ADPR per hour in the presence of 1 mm ADPR at pH 7.4 under described conditions. Immunoblotting Assay for the Detection of Caveolin 1—Proteins of MVs were separated by SDS-PAGE in a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™-ECL™, Amersham Biosciences). The result of transfer was visualized by Ponceau S (0.2% Ponceau S, 3% trichloroacetic acid). The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 3% gelatin solution in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature. The mouse monoclonal IgG against chicken caveolin type 1 (BD Biosciences) was diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions in 1% gelatin solution in TBS-Tween 20 (TTBS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The nitrocellulose membrane was washed in TTBS and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Immun-Blot Assay Kit, Bio-Rad) in the same buffer as for primary antibody. The membrane was washed, and bands were visualized by addition of color-developing solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. Identification of Mineral Complexes by Infrared Spectroscopy—From the mineralization assay, the formed minerals were centrifuged and washed two times with water, then dried under N2. Dry material (0.5 mg) was incorporated into KBr (150 mg) to form pellets. The infrared spectra were measured by means of Nicolet FTIR spectrometer model 510 m. The optical resolution was 4 cm-1 but spectral points were encoded every 2 cm-1 ×128 scans were recorded. The infrared spectrum of hydroxyapatite standard (Sigma) was prepared and measured to identify the mineral complexes. Characterization of MVs—The MVs isolated from femurs of 17-day-old chick embryos were found to be membranous structures of diameters ranging from 100 to 200 nm, as revealed by electron microscopy (Fig. 2A). They were similar to those extracted from growth plate cartilage of 6-8-week-old chicken (47Kirsch T. Harisson G. Golub E.E. Nah H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35577-35583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The specific PME activity of TNAP in MVs at pH 10.4 was 30 ± 10 units/mg membrane protein. SDS-PAGE of MVs showed several bands, among them three intense bands with apparent molecular masses of 45, 37, and 31 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 2), consistent with the finding of Wu et al. (48Wu L.N.Y.

Although MVs are derived from plasma membrane, they did not contain caveolin 1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3), which is present in the plasma membrane of osseous cells (pellet obtained after the first centrifugation at 13,000 × g during MVs isolation procedure) as revealed by immunoblotting analysis (∼26 kDa, Fig. 2B, lane 4), suggesting that the amount of contaminated plasma membrane fragments in MV preparations is very low. The ability of isolated MVs to induce mineral formation was monitored by light scattering at 340 nm. MVs in the SCL mineralization medium containing 2 mm Ca2+ and 1.42 mm Pi induced a short lag period of about 4 h when Pi and Ca2+ accumulated within MVs; thereafter, the absorbance at 340 nm increased rapidly, indicating the formation of calcium-Pi complexes (39Wu L.N.

In the mineralization medium without MVs, the changes in turbidity were almost negligible over a 12-h incubation time (Fig. 2C, bottom trace), confirming the essential role of MVs for the initialization of mineralization. The mineral formed under the same conditions for the turbidity measurements were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy. The positions of bands in the infrared spectrum at 1111 cm-1, 1033 cm-1, 961 cm-1, 602 cm-1, and 562 cm-1 (Fig. 2D, trace i), corresponding to mineral formed in the MVs, matched almost exactly the positions of bands in the infrared spectrum of hydroxyapatite (Fig. 2D, trace ii), indicating the ability Minor of MVs to produce hydroxyapatite. variations around 1111 cm-1 could be because of the presence of MV membrane phospholipids, as evidenced by the 1739-cm-1 band. The presence of MV proteins was indicated by the 1652-cm-1 and 1548-cm-1 bands (Fig. 2D, trace i). Characteristic of ATP-induced Retardation of Mineral Formation by MVs—Increasing the Pi concentration or the presence of additional phosphomonoester substrate, such as AMP in mineralization medium, reduced the time delay for the accumulation of Ca2+ and Pi within MVs. Supplementation of mineralization medium with 1 mm AMP resulted in reduced retardation of mineral formation from 4 h to 2 h (Fig. 3) compared with MVs incubated in the SCL without AMP (Fig. 3). Addition of 2 mm Pi reduced dramatically the retardation of the induction phase to ∼0.5-1 h (Fig. 3). The rate of Pi uptake into MVs depends on the Pi concentration outside MV, and TNAP may provide Pi by hydrolyzing the phosphorylated substrate. However, addition of 0.33 mm ATP, another source of Pi and substrate of TNAP, in the mineralization medium led to a much longer delay (24-48 h) in the induction phase of mineralization (Fig. 3) as compared with other substrates. Infrared spectra of the mineral formed in the presence of 0.33 mm ATP showed that there was no hydroxyapatite-like mineral but only other calcium-phosphate complexes as characterized by the broad bands in the 1082 cm-1 to 1031 cm-1 region (Fig. 2D, trace iii) (50Derfus B.A. Kurtin S.M. Camacho N.P. Kurup I. Ryan L.M. Conn. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of a relatively low concentration of ATP (≤ 0.2 mm), MVs were still capable to initiate the formation of hydroxyapatite (Fig. 4, traces i-iv), showing a dependence of hydroxyapatite formation on the concentration of ATP in the mineralization medium. Addition of ATP concentration up to 1 mm in the mineralization medium did not lead to the accumulation of calcium-PP i complexes as revealed by the absence of the characteristic 930-cm-1 band of the calcium-PPi complex (51Derfus B.

Protein was concentrated using 30-kDa centrifugal filters (Millipore) and stored in wash buffer with 20 mm imidazole.

KirBac1.1 with a His6 tag was purified by affinity on a Co2+ column. As indicated in Fig. 1A the eluted protein is highly purified. While we cannot exclude minor additional contaminants, associated proteins, if they exist, are not present in stoichiometric amounts. Fig. 1B shows that the purified protein generates robust channel activity when incorporated into pure POPE:POPG membranes. Fig. 1B also shows that incorporation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 into the liposomes at less than 1% mole fraction (Fig. 1B) does indeed significantly modulate KirBac1.1 activity, while KcsA activity is unaffected (Fig. 1C). However, contrary to expectations from eukaryotic Kir channel experiments, KirBac1.1 channels are actually inhibited by PIP2, being half-maximally inhibited at ∼0.3% mole fraction (Fig. 1C). KcsA is an important control, indicating that incorporation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the liposomal membrane does not non-specifically abolish ion channel activity. Interestingly, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is similar to the expected PtdIns(4,5)P2 content of mammalian cell membranes (23Nasuhoglu C. Feng S. Mao J. Yamamoto M.

Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). This first experiment defines a direct interaction of PtdIns(4,5)P2 with the channel protein and excludes any possibility of intermediary components, such as cytoskeletal proteins (25Harvey J. Hardy S.C. Irving A.J. Ashford M.L. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Furukawa T. Yamane T. Terai T. Katayama Y. Hiraoka M. Pfluegers Arch.-Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 504-512Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is surprising that KirBac1.1 is inhibited by PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the liposomal membrane, whereas application of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to eukaryotic Kir channels in native membranes always causes activation (9Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Jin T. Ramdya P.P. Molnar Z. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we hypothesize that the nature of the PtdIns(4,5)P2-channel interaction is physically similar in both cases and that potentially straightforward explanations for activation versus inhibition may exist, as discussed below. However, any such explanation first requires that essential structural requirements for phosphoinositide modulation of Kir channels are replicated in the two cases. In eukaryotic Kir channels, it is well established that modulation requires a negatively charged head group and an acyl chain and is proportional to the number of phosphates on the head group (9Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Jin T. Ramdya P.P. Molnar Z. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 13Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, these requirements are also met for modulation of KirBac1.1 activity. Without the inositol headgroup, diacylglycerol incorporation or addition of IP3 both fail to affect channel activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Unphosphorylated PtdIns fails to inhibit channels, and singly phosphorylated PtdIns(4)P is ∼10-fold less effective than PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2A). Among eukaryotic Kir channels, there is varying apparent specificity for the phosphate position on the inositol headgroup (9Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Jin T. Ramdya P.P. Molnar Z. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Rohacs T. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36065-36072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), with preferential activation by phosphoinositides when the phosphate is in position 4 or 5 for most Kir family members but decreased or no preference for Kir3.x and Kir6.2 channels. To test the specificity of KirBac1.1 inhibition as a function of phosphate position, we measured channel activity in liposomes with different isomers (Fig. 3). KirBac1.1 shows no preference for headgroup position and as such behaves very similarly to Kir6.x family members (9Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Jin T. Ramdya P.P. Molnar Z. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Using highly purified channel protein reconstituted into liposomes of defined composition, the above experiments establish a direct interaction between PIP2 in the membrane and the channel protein: there is no micellar PIP2, and interaction must be with PIP2 incorporated into the liposome membrane. By examining the effects of PIP2 metabolites, we also unequivocally demonstrate that PIP2 itself is the critical interactor and, moreover, that lipid structure specificity is the same as that for activation of eukaryotic channels, when applied exogenously. This is consistent with modulation of eukaryotic Kir channels being through a fundamentally similar direct physical interaction with the channel. Why then is KirBac1.1 inhibited by PIP2, whereas eukaryotic channels are activated? We suggest that subtle differences in the structure of the two groups of channels can give rise to activation in one case and inhibition in the other. Sequence alignments of eukaryotic and bacterial Kir channels (Fig. 4) indicate significant gap-free homologies in transmembrane regions and conserved N- and C-terminal regions that generate the pore and the Kir cytoplasmic domain (21Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 28Nishida M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Notably, however, eukaryotic Kir channels contain two additional 3-amino acid linkers connecting cytoplasmic domains to the slide helix and to the second transmembrane helices. The amino acids in the second linker are generally charged and have repeatedly been invoked as critical interacting charges for PIP2 activation of eukaryotic Kir channels (5Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 13Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G.

Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that these charged linkers in eukaryotic channels are essential for PIP2 activation; conceivably they appeared only in response to evolutionary pressure as the otherwise inhibitory effect of PIP2 caused loss of Kir channel function in early eukaryotic membranes. While the nature and extent of these linkers is clearly important for channel function, further experiments are warranted to examine whether and how their length and nature are involved in transducing PIP2 interaction to activation or inhibition of channel activity. It is intriguing to note that opposing effects of PIP2 are seen in the TRP channel family. For some, e.g. TRPM5, TRPM7, and TRPM8, PIP2 has an activating effect (32Liu D. Liman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15160-15165Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 33Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Nat.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). However, PIP2 inhibits TRPL and TRPV1 channels, and mutation of residues in the same C-terminal “TRP-box” region that is invoked as necessary for PIP2 activation of TRPM8 channels (34Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) strengthens or weakens inhibition of TRPV1 by PIP2 (8Prescott E.D. Julius D. Science. 2003; 300: 1284-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In studying modulation of channel activity in cell membranes, PIP2 levels have been indirectly manipulated by hydrolysis (phospholipase) or synthesis (application of MgATP). Such manipulations can cause changes in multiple other membrane constituents and are not quantitative. Although semiquantitation has been cleverly achieved using fluorescent-tagged PIP2 -associating protein domains (35Holz R.W. Hlubek M.D. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. Balla T. Ozaki S. Prestwich G.D.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), direct measurement of [PIP2] is also not possible. PIP2 has also been added to excised membrane patches in micelles. If the supposed consequence (incorporation of PIP2 into the membrane leaflet) is achievable, it should also be possible to perform essentially this same experiment in the liposome assay. We incubated liposomes in micellar PIP2 for 5 min prior to Rb+ uptake assay (Fig. 5A). KirBac1.1 activity is again inhibited, with no effect on KcsA activity. However, in contrast to the complete inhibition observed when PIP2 is incorporated into the membrane, inhibition plateaus at ∼50%, broadly consistent with the expectation that KirBac1.1 channels can insert into the membrane in either of the two possible orientations and that PIP2 partitions primarily into the outer leaflet of the membrane. A further approach to reduce [PIP2] in native membranes has been to apply poly-l-lysine, which electrostatically shields the anionic headgroups (13Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 37Deutsch N. Matsuoka S. Weiss J.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 773-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Again, broadly consistent with the hypothesis that PIP2 headgroups interact with the channel, application of poly-l-lysine reduced the inhibitory effect of membrane PIP2 on KirBac1.1 fluxes (Fig. 5B).

However, almost all studies of channel-lipid interactions to date are inevitably indirect; in many cases it cannot be established whether the PIP2 is even acting from within the membrane (19Hilgemann D.W. Science. 2004; 304: 223-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Suh B.C. Hille B. Curr. Opin.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have shown that peptide fragments of ion channels can directly interact with PIP2, the possibility of intermediates in physiological regulation cannot be excluded. In the present study, we use a novel approach, purified channel protein, reconstituted into lipid vesicles of fully defined composition, to unambiguously establish three critical principles: (i) an action specifically of PIP2 in the membrane, (ii) direct interaction between the channel and PIP2, and (iii) the concentration dependence of this interaction. These are key mechanistic aspects of lipid modulation of channel activity and support the idea that direct interactions underlie eukaryotic Kir channel modulation. This assay provides a model system in which to study channel-PIP2 interactions; extensive mutagenesis studies, in combination with molecular modeling based on crystal structures (40Haider S.

To examine their transcriptional activity during mouse embryonic development, we generated transgenic mice in which the expression of the β-galactosidase transgene was controlled by the −2.7-kb Foxf1 promoter region, the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter region, or the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter region fused to the 3′RE. The −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter sequences induced appropriate transgene expression in the midgut and developing intestine, whereas the −2.7-kb Foxf1 promoter region was transcriptionally inactive. Addition of 3′RE to the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter restored proper transgene expression in the foregut, liver, and lung mesenchyme and prevented ectopic transgene expression in the developing nervous system. Cotransfection studies demonstrated that FoxA2 protein bound to the 3′RE region (+4506/+4529 bp) and was sufficient to inhibit expression of the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter. Furthermore, C/EBPβ and HNF-6 proteins bound to the 3′RE region (+4647/+4694 bp) and provided synergistic transcriptional activation of the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter in cotransfection assays. These studies demonstrated that the conserved Foxf1 3′RE region is essential for proper tissue-specific regulation of the Foxf1 promoter region during mouse embryogenesis.

Embryonic development of gut-derived organs is regulated by distinct signaling pathways, which stimulate expression of mesenchymal or endoderm-specific transcription factors. These in turn bind cooperatively to distinct promoter regions and activate target gene expression (1Costa R.H. Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Am. J.

Dynamic changes in gene expression during embryonic development are critical to mediate proper organ morphogenesis, which involves extensive cellular proliferation, migration, and establishment of appropriate positioning of epithelial cells with developing mesenchyme. Understanding the regulation of tissue-specific transcription factors will provide insight regarding organ morphogenesis during embryonic development.

Approximately 55% of the Foxf1+/- newborn mice, which have only 20% of the pulmonary wild type levels of Foxf1 mRNA (low Foxf1+/-), exhibited defects in the development of peripheral lung saccules and microvasculature, severe fusions of the right lung lobes, and pulmonary hemorrhage causing perinatal lethality (24Kalinichenko V.V.

These lung defects were associated with diminished expression of Flk-1, Pecam-1, Bmp4, Notch-2, and lung Kruppel-like factor, as well as delayed expression of Fgf10, implicating the Foxf1 gene in regulation of branching lung morphogenesis and vasculogenesis (24Kalinichenko V.V.

Most interestingly, 40% of the newborn Foxf1+/- mice displayed compensatory increases in pulmonary levels of Foxf1 mRNA (high Foxf1+/- mice). High Foxf1+/- mice survived and exhibited normal development of the peripheral lung microvasculature (24Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Beer-Stoltz D. Shin B. Rausa F.M. Clark J. Whitsett J.A. Watkins S.C. Costa R.H. Dev.

Furthermore, Foxf1 is expressed in hepatic stellate cells, and haploinsufficiency of the Foxf1 gene caused defective stellate cell activation during liver regeneration (23Kalinichenko V.V. Bhattacharyya D. Zhou Y. Gusarova G.A. Kim W. Shin B. Costa R.H. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that the Foxf1 promoter is highly GC-rich and is regulated by DNA methylation (28Chang V.W. Ho Y. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 267: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cotransfection assays demonstrated that the −1-kb Foxf1 upstream sequences are sufficient to drive the luciferase reporter construct in distinct mouse cell lines (28Chang V.W. Ho Y. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 267: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Despite growing interest in the Foxf1 gene as a very important transcriptional regulator in developing mesoderm, the in vivo regulation of the Foxf1 promoter remains to be characterized. To investigate Foxf1 regulatory regions, we have generated transgenic mice that use β-galactosidase (β-gal) reporter transgene driven by either the −2.7-kb Foxf1 promoter, the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter, or the −5.3-kb Foxf1 region fused to 3′ Foxf1 conserved regulatory element (3′RE), which is located approximately 1 kb 3′ to the mouse Foxf1 gene. Although the −2.7-kb Foxf1 region was insufficient to drive β-gal expression in vivo, the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter induced transgenic β-gal expression in the mesenchyme of midgut and developing intestine. Addition of the 3′RE to the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter restored proper β-gal transgene expression in the foregut mesoderm and in the mesenchyme of liver and lung, and inhibited ectopic expression of the −5.3-kb Foxf1 transgene in a developing brain and spinal cord. Our results suggest that the Foxf1 3′RE is essential for mesenchyme-specific Foxf1 promoter activity in developing embryos. Generation of Foxf1 Transgenic Mice—The −2.7-kb Foxf1 or −5.3-kb Foxf1 upstream promoter sequences were fused in-frame with a nuclear localizing β-galactosidase (β-gal) gene and then cloned into an XbaI site of the pBS plasmid (Stratagene). The 3′ Foxf1 regulatory element (+4400 to +4800 bp) was generated by PCR amplification from mouse genomic DNA and cloned into an XhoI site 5′ to the −5.3-kb Foxf1-β- gal construct. The −2.7-kb Foxf1-β-gal, −5.3-kb Foxf1-β-gal, and −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE-β-gal DNA constructs were injected into pronuclei of FVB/N mouse eggs. The fertilized mouse eggs were transferred to surrogate mothers by the University of Illinois at Chicago Transgenic Mouse Facility. Transgenic mice were identified by PCR analysis of the mouse tail DNA using primers specific to the β-gal gene as described previously (24Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Beer-Stoltz D. Shin B. Rausa F.M. Clark J. Whitsett J.A. Watkins S.C. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Four distinct −5.3-kb Foxf1-β-gal mouse lines, three −2.7-kb Foxf1-β-gal mouse lines, and two −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE-β-gal mouse lines were established and analyzed for β-gal transgene activity. We described previously the generation of heterozygous Foxf1 knock-in mice (Foxf1+/-), in which the Foxf1 winged helix DNA binding domain was replaced by an in-frame insertion of a nuclear-localizing β-gal gene. These Foxf1+/- mice were bred for six generations into the Black Swiss mouse genetic background (24Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Beer-Stoltz D. Shin B. Rausa F.M. Clark J. Whitsett J.A. Watkins S.C. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Expression of the β-gal gene in Foxf1+/- mice was under the control of genomic Foxf1 regulatory sequences, thus allowing the use of β-gal enzyme staining for visualizing Foxf1-expressing cells. Foxf1+/- or Foxf1-β-gal transgenic male mice were mated with wild type female mice to generate mouse embryos at various days of gestation. Embryonic tail DNA was used for genotyping by PCR analysis as described previously (24Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Beer-Stoltz D. Shin B. Rausa F.M. Clark J. Whitsett J.A. Watkins S.C. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical and β-Galactosidase Staining—To visualize β-gal-expressing cells, mouse embryos and adult tissue were stained for β-gal enzyme activity with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopy-ranoside (X-gal) substrate for 16 h at 30 °C and then paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and counterstained with nuclear fast red as described previously (24Kalinichenko V.V.

For colocalization studies, the −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE 15.5 dpc transgenic livers were dissected, stained for β-gal enzyme activity, and then stained with desmin antibodies (clone DE-U-10; Sigma) as described (23Kalinichenko V.V. Bhattacharyya D. Zhou Y. Gusarova G.A. Kim W. Shin B. Costa R.H. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The cellular expression pattern of the desmin protein was visualized by using secondary antibody conjugated with biotin followed by avidin-horseradish peroxidase complex and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate (all from Vector Laboratories) as described (29Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Shin B. Costa R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L695-L704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Colocalization studies were also performed using β-gal and biotinylated isolectin B4 following by avidin-horseradish peroxidase complex and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate (Vector Laboratories) as described previously (24Kalinichenko V.V.

Nuclear fast red (Vector Laboratories) was used as a counterstain. Cotransfection Studies and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—For transient transfection experiments, U2OS, HepG2, or HMEC cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with 1.6 μg of the −5.3-kb Foxf1-luciferase(LUC), −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE-LUC, or −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE Δ+4641/+4752-bp mutant-LUC reporter constructs using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following primers were used for PCR amplification of the 3′RE and 3′RE Δ+4641/+4752-bp mutant: forward primer, 5′-cacctaggaaaacaaacataataag, and reverse primers, 5′-ctccccagctccggcttttccctg and 5′-agaaattaccctcccgtccagaatg. In separate experiments, these LUC reporter plasmids were cotransfected with 250 ng of CMV expression vectors containing the following transcription factors: FoxA2, HNF-6, C/EBPβ, Nkx2.5, GATA-4, or a combination of them. We also included 30 ng of CMV-Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. Thirty six hours post-transfection, cells were prepared for dual luciferase assays (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to a CMV-empty vector and calculated as a fold induction compared with pGL3Basic-LUC activity. Experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate, and the mean ± S.D. was determined. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), U2OS cells (100-mm plate) were either left untransfected or transiently transfected with 15 μg of CMV-FoxA1, CMV-FoxA2, CMV-HNF-6, or CMV-C/EBPβ expression vectors using FuGENE 6. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection as described previously (19Peterson R.S. Lim L. Ye H. Zhou H. Overdier D.G. Costa R.H. Mech. Dev. 1997; 69: 53-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed with 5′ end radioactively labeled doublestranded oligonucleotides and 5 μg of nuclear extracts that were prepared from either untransfected or transfected U2OS cells using binding reaction conditions as described previously (19Peterson R.S.

We used the following double-stranded oligonucleotides made to the Foxf1 3′RE: +4506/+4529-bp 5′-taggaaaacaaacataataagccg and +4647/+4694-bp 5′-tctgttacatcaaaattatcaataaactagtccgggcaattaatgtcc. For DNA competitions in EMSA, we added 500-fold molar excess of cold competitor double-stranded oligonucleotide or nonspecific SP1 oligonucleotide to the binding reaction as described previously (6Kim I.M.

Infection of Hepa1-6 Cells with Recombinant Adenoviruses and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Hepa1-6 cells (1 × 107 cells per 150-mm dish), which do not express endogenous FoxA2, were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 100 infectious units/cell with adenovirus containing FoxA2 expression vector (AdFoxA2) as described (31Tan Y. Costa R.H. Kovesdi I. Reichel R.R. Gene Expr. 2001; 9: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). AdLacZ was used as a control. Infected Hepa1-6 cells were cross-linked in situ by the addition of 37% formaldehyde and were used to prepare protein extract as described (32Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The resulting extract was subsequently sonicated and used for the immunoprecipitation (IP) with FoxA2 rabbit antiserum as described previously (33Rausa F. Tan Y. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with P-selectin rabbit antiserum (BD Biosciences) was used as a control. Cross-links were reversed on all samples by the addition of TE buffer containing 10 μg of RNase A (15 min at 25 °C). Proteinase K (10 μg) was then added, and samples were digested for 16 h at 65 °C. DNA was extracted from the digested samples using PCR purification columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). We then used these ChIP DNA samples for PCR by using primers specific to Foxf1 3′RE region +4504/+4680 bp (sense 5′-acctaggaaaacaaacataataag and antisense 5′-actagtttattgataattttgatg). Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Values for all measurements were expressed as the mean ± S.D.

This analysis identified two regions of homology within the −5-kb Foxf1 promoter region (I and II; Fig. 1, A and B) and a homologous 241-nucleotide region (III; +4511 to +4752 bp) located approximately 1-kb 3′ to the mouse Foxf1 gene (3′RE; Fig. 1, A and B). We used the TFSearch, TRANSFAC, and MacVector Subsequence transcription factor binding site search programs to identify potential binding sites in the Foxf1 conserved regions. The binding sites that are conserved in both the mouse and human Foxf1 regulatory sequences have been listed in Fig. 1B. The homologous Foxf1 sequences contain potential binding sites for the following families of transcription factors: basic leucine zipper (bZIP) CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ), winged helix/Forkhead Box A (FoxA), zinc finger GATA, homeodomain Nkx2.5, and cut-homeodomain HNF-6 transcription factors (Fig. 1B). The -5.3-kb Foxf1 Promoter Drives Embryonic β-Gal Transgene Expression in Mesenchyme of Midgut and Developing Intestine—To determine the role of conserved Foxf1 DNA regions in vivo, we generated transgenic mice in which the β-gal reporter transgene was expressed under the control of either −2.7-kb Foxf1 promoter (contains region I), the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter (contains regions I and II), or the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter fused to the 3′RE (−5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE; contains regions I, II, and III; Fig. 2A). Three distinct transgenic −2.7-kb Foxf1 mouse lines, four −5.3-kb Foxf1 lines, and two −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE mouse lines were established and analyzed for β-gal transgene expression. Similar results were obtained among the lines in each group, suggesting that the observed β-gal expression patterns were not because of the precise sites of transgene integration. The −2.7-kb Foxf1, −5.3-kb Foxf1, or −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE transgenic embryos were dissected at different stages of mouse development, stained for β-gal enzyme activity, and then compared with β-gal staining of the Foxf1+/- embryos, which contain a β-gal reporter gene knocked into endogenous Foxf1 gene locus (24Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Beer-Stoltz D. Shin B. Rausa F.M. Clark J. Whitsett J.A. Watkins S.C. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The −2.7-kb Foxf1 promoter region was insufficient to drive β-gal transgene in vivo, as demonstrated by the absence of β-gal staining in −2.7-kb Foxf1 9.5-18.5 dpc embryos (data not shown). Both −5.3-kb Foxf1 and −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE embryos displayed transgenic β-gal staining in the mesoderm of midgut (Fig. 2, F, G, and I) and mesenchymal cells of developing 12.5 dpc intestine (Fig. 2, K and L), which was similar to the results from the Foxf1+/- mouse embryos (Fig. 2, E, H, and J). Transgenic β-gal expression was also detected in muscle layers and lamina propria of the adult mouse intestine in both −5.3-kb Foxf1 and −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE transgenic mice (Fig. 2, M–O), suggesting that the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter contains regulatory sequences that are sufficient for proper β-gal transgene expression in mesenchyme-derived intestinal tissues. Foxf1 3′RE Is Essential for the Foxf1 Promoter to Drive β-Gal Transgene Expression in the Foregut Mesoderm—Although β-gal staining was not detected in septum transversum mesoderm of either −5.3-kb Foxf1 or −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE 9.5 dpc embryos (Fig. 2, C and D), only the −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE transgenic embryos displayed strong β-gal staining in the splanchnic mesenchyme of the foregut (Fig. 2D). This β-gal expression in the foregut was similar to the staining pattern from endogenous Foxf1 gene locus in Foxf1+/- mouse embryos (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Foxf1 3′RE enhances the −5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter activity in foregut mesoderm. The Foxf1 3′RE Is Essential for β-Gal Transgene Expression in Mesenchymal Cells of the Embryonic Liver and Lung—We have previously used Foxf1+/- mice to demonstrate that β-gal is abundantly expressed in the mesenchyme of the embryonic lung (24Kalinichenko V.V.

Consistent with the absence of β-gal staining in the foregut of −5.3-kb Foxf1 9.5 dpc embryos (Fig. 2C), transgenic β-gal expression was not observed in the −5.3-kb Foxf1 12.5 dpc lungs (Fig. 3B). In contrast, −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE 12.5 dpc lungs displayed mesenchymal β-gal staining, which was increased in peribronchial regions (Fig. 3C). However, these β-gal levels were significantly diminished when compared with age-matched lungs from Foxf1+/- embryos containing a knock in of the β-galactosidase gene (Fig. 3A). Transgenic β-gal expression was also observed in smooth muscle cells surrounding pulmonary airways and trachea of 15.5 dpc lungs from −5.3-kb Foxf1 + 3′RE transgenic embryos (Fig. 3L and data not shown). We demonstrated previously that Foxf1 is expressed in the mesenchyme of the gallbladder and embryonic and adult liver (21Kalinichenko V.V. Zhou Y. Bhattacharyya D. Kim W. Shin B. Bambal K. Costa R.H.

https://openalex.org/W2015423494,"For more than 50 years, it has been known that K+ is an essential activator of pyruvate kinase (Kachmar, J. F., and Boyer, P. D. (1953) J. Biol. Chem. 200, 669-683). However, the role of K+ in the catalysis by pyruvate kinase has not been totally understood. Previous studies without K+ showed that the affinity of ADP-Mg2+ depends on the concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate, although the kinetics of the enzyme at saturating K+ concentrations show independence in the binding of substrates (Reynard, A. M., Hass, L. F., Jacobsen, D. D. & Boyer, P. D. (1961) J. Biol. Chem. 236, 2277-2283). Here, we explored the kinetics of the enzyme with and without K+. The results show that without K+, the kinetic mechanism of pyruvate kinase changes from random to ordered with phosphoenol-pyruvate as first substrate. Vmax with K+ was about 400 higher than without K+. In the presence of K+, the affinities for phosphoenol-pyruvate, ADP-Mg2+, oxalate, and ADP-Cr2+ were 2-6-fold higher than in the absence of K+. This as well as fluorescence data also indicate that K+ is involved in the acquisition of the active conformation of the enzyme, allowing either phosphoenolpyruvate or ADP to bind independently (random mechanism). In the absence of K+, ADP cannot bind to the enzyme until phosphoenolpyruvate forms a competent active site (ordered mechanism). We propose that K+ induces the closure of the active site and the arrangement of the residues involved in the binding of the nucleotide.

Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 200: 669-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described the activating effect of K+ on pyruvate kinase (PK). 3The abbreviations used are: PKpyruvate kinaseWT-PKrabbit muscle pyruvate kinase wild typeE117K-PKrabbit muscle pyruvate kinase E117K mutantLDHlactate dehydrogenasePEPphosphoenolpyruvateMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Since that time, many enzymes that are activated by monovalent cations have been described (2Suelter C.H. Science. 1970; 168: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). More recently, high resolution crystallographic structures of Na+ and K+ in proteins were reviewed (3Larsen T.M. Reed G.H. Bertini I. Sigel A. Sigel H. Handbook of Metalloproteins. Dekker, New York2001: 9-37Google Scholar). In some cases, the structures have been instrumental in the understanding of the mechanism of ion activation and selectivity (4Di Cera E. C. R. Biol. 2004; 327: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Toney M.D. Hohenester E. Cowan S.W. Jansonius J.N. Science. 1993; 261: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of the selectivity of PK for K+ and the mechanism through which K+ activates the enzyme are not entirely known. pyruvate kinase rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase wild type rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase E117K mutant lactate dehydrogenase phosphoenolpyruvate 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Nowak and Suelter (6Nowak T. Suelter C.H. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1981; 35: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) wrote a historical description of the effect of K+ on PK. In 1953, Kachmar and Boyer (1Kachmar J.F. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 200: 669-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) put forth that the binding of the monovalent cation induces displacement of adjoining structures and that the expression of catalysis was associated with the magnitude of the displacement. Indeed, several physical studies showed that the conformation of the protein is modified by monovalent cations. Alkali metal ions change the UV, fluorescence polarization, and circular dichroism spectra of the enzyme (7Kayne F.J. Suelter C.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 897-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Wilson R.H. Evans H.J. Becker R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3825-3832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Suelter C.H.

They also alter its immunoelectrophoretic behavior (11Sorger G.J. Ford R.E. Evans H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1614-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the sedimentation velocity of the protein (12Kayne F.J. Suelter C.H. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1678-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Structural modifications of PK have been observed with non-activating monovalent cations; this suggests that conformational changes are involved in catalysis, albeit they do not suffice to support high activities (10Wildes R.A. Evans H.J. Becker R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 229: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 11Sorger G.J. Ford R.E. Evans H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1614-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Later, evidence for the interaction of K+ with substrates was reported. This provided important evidence for a direct participation on the catalytic events at the active site. Along this time, kinetic, UV difference spectroscopy, and EPR studies showed a synergistic effect in the binding of Mn2+ and K+ to the enzyme (13Suelter C.H. Singleton Jr., R. Kayne F.J. Arrington S. Glass J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Reed G.H. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6436-6442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In NMR proton relaxation rate titration experiments, it was found that K+ raised the affinity of the enzyme for PEP and its analogs and that PEP and its analogs raised the affinity of the enzyme for K+. It was also found that K+ decreased the affinity of analogs of PEP that lack the free carboxyl function (15Nowak T. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was reasoned that monovalent cations facilitate the interaction of PEP to the binary enzyme-Mn2+ complex by interacting with the carboxylate group (15Nowak T. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In consonance with this hypothesis, NMR studies showed that the distance between Mn2+ and 205Tl+ complexed to PK was shortened by the addition of PEP. Thus, it was rather evident that the monovalent cation binds at the catalytic site and participates directly in the interaction of PEP with the enzyme-Mn2+ complex (16Kayne F.J. Reuben J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 220-222Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Reuben J. Kayne F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6227-6234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, Suelter (2Suelter C.H. Science. 1970; 168: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) proposed that K+ assists in the stabilization of the enolate form of pyruvate. The localization of the active site was suggested by the first crystallographic structure of pyruvate kinase; however, the binding site for the monovalent cation was not ascertained (18Muirhead H. Clayden D.A. Barford D. Lorimer C.G. Fothjergill-Gilmore L.A. Schiltz E. Schmitt W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The interaction of K+ with the substrates and products was definitely demonstrated by the crystallographic structures of PK complexed with K+,Mg2+, and phospholactate (19Larsen T.M. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G.E. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or ATP (20Larsen T.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6247-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The data showed that K+ interacts with the phosphoryl oxygen of either PEP or that of γ-phosphate of ATP. All of the crystal structures of PK up to date are in complex with monovalent cations; thus, the effects that K+ exerts on the overall structure and function of PK are not well understood. Likewise, it is not clear what residues are involved in the transduction of K+ binding to the enhancement of catalytic activity. In this regard, it is relevant that the binding site for monovalent cation is identical in all of the structures reported, regardless of whether they are in an active (closed) or inactive (open) conformation (19Larsen T.M. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G.E. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or in complex with K+ or the nonactivator cation Na+ (20Larsen T.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6247-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Since catalysis is more amenable to kinetic than to structural studies, in this work, we investigated the kinetic features of the enzyme in the absence of K+. It should be mentioned that hardly any attention has been given to the characteristics of PK in the absence of monovalent cation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the understanding of the structure and function of the enzyme without K+ can provide a powerful background for the understanding of the action of K+ on PK. We also studied PK under conditions in which the enzyme displays a considerable K+-independent activity: in water/Me2SO mixtures (21Ramírez-Silva L. Ferreira S.T. Nowak T. Tuena de Gómez-Puyou M. Gómez-Puyou A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3267-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and in the PK mutant E117K (E117K-PK) (22Laughlin L.T. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Preparation of Chromium-ADP—Chromium-ADP (ADP-Cr2+)was prepared according to DePamphilis (23DePamphilis M.L. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3714-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), except that tetramethyammonium bicarbonate was used instead of KHCO3 in the neutralization step. The purity of ADP-Cr2+ was ascertained from its visible spectral characteristics and by thin layer chromatography. Tetramethyammonium bicarbonate was prepared by ion exchange chromatography in a Dowex 50WX4-100 (15 × 2.5-cm) column. Subcloning of E117K—Plasmid pET22b containing the E117K-PK gene, plasmid pTrc99A, and Escherichia coli PB25Δ-PKIΔ-PKII were kindly provided by Dr. George H. Reed from the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI) (22Laughlin L.T. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and by Dr. Francisco Bolívar Zapata (National University of Mexico) (24Ponce E. Flores N. Martinez A. Valle F. Bolivar F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5719-5722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. E117K-PK originally cloned in pET22b was subcloned in pTrc99A. PCR was performed with the 5′-CATGGAATTCTAATAAGGAGCTCCATATGTCAAAG-3′ primer containing an EcoRI restriction site and the upstream NdeI site of E117K-PK and T7 terminator primer. The PCR-amplified DNA product was cut with EcoRI, inserted to pTrc99A, and transformed to competent E. coli PB25Δ-PKIΔ-PKII (PB25-E117K) that contained antibiotic resistance cassettes to chloramphenicol and kanamycin. Subsequently, sequence analysis was carried out. Cell Growth and Purification of the E117K Mutant—LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol was inoculated with PB25-E117K. Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 20 g/liter of lactose at an A600 of about 0.8. The enzyme was purified as in Ref. 22Laughlin L.T. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar with some modifications. Cells were treated with lysozyme and an osmotic shock. DNase and a protease inhibitor mixture were added to the spheroplasts, which were then broken by sonication. The suspension was centrifuged 20 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 37%, and the resultant supernatant was collected. A second precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 65% saturation was prepared. The pellet was collected, suspended, and desalted by dialysis. The final steps involved ion exchange chromatography in DEAE and carboxymethyl-Sepharose. The E117K mutant was 95% pure as indicated by SDS-PAGE. Assays of Pyruvate Kinase Activity—WT-PK and hog muscle lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were obtained as ammonium sulfate suspensions from Roche Applied Science. Ammonium sulfate-free enzymes were obtained as described (25Ramírez-Silva L. de Gómez-Puyou M.T. Gómez-Puyou A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5332-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Contaminating NH+4,Na+, and K+ in reaction mixtures were below the detection limit (10 μm) as indicated (25Ramírez-Silva L. de Gómez-Puyou M.T. Gómez-Puyou A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5332-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The formation of pyruvate was measured at 25 °C either in a coupled system with LDH and NADH (26Büchner T. Pleiderer G. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 435-440Crossref Scopus (626) Google Scholar) or by arresting a 5-min reaction with 1 m HClO4 and subsequently neutralizing it. In the latter case, the amount of pyruvate formed was determined with LDH and NADH. The reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Mes-Tris, pH 6.0, and the concentrations of cations (Mg2+ and K+), substrates (PEP and ADP), and inhibitors (oxalate and ADP-Cr2+) indicated under “Results.” The ADP-Mg2+ complexes and free Mg2+ concentrations were calculated using the software CHELATOR (27Schoenmakers T.J.M. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet P.R. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-879PubMed Google Scholar). Ionized PEP concentrations were calculated considering a pK value of 6.3. (CH3)4NCl was added to a final salt concentration of 0.88 m to compensate for different ligand concentrations. In all coupling assays, the concentration of LDH added to the reaction mixture was enough to overcome the inhibition of oxalate and Me2SO. The specific activity was not increased by the 5-fold inclusion of LDH. Activity was initiated with PK. The temperature was 25 °C. Kinetic Studies—Initial velocities of PK were determined with and without dead end inhibitors (oxalate or ADP-Cr2+). In the former condition, the patterns were obtained at varying concentrations of PEP at several fixed levels of ADP-Mg2+. In the latter condition, the inhibition patterns were obtained by varying one substrate with the second fixed and at different fixed levels of the inhibitor. Fluorescence Experiments—Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra and anisotropy measurements of PK in water medium were made in an ISS PC1 Photon Counting Spectrofluorometer (ISS, Urbana, IL) as described before (21Ramírez-Silva L. Ferreira S.T. Nowak T. Tuena de Gómez-Puyou M. Gómez-Puyou A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3267-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Blanks without PK were subtracted from the experimental. Initial Velocity Studies of WT-PK with and without K+in Aqueous Medium—PK catalyzes the transfer of phosphoryl group of PEP to ADP in the presence of two ions of Mg2+ and one of K+. WT-PK has an absolute requirement for K+ (1Kachmar J.F. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 200: 669-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); its activity with and without K+ is 250 and 0.02 μmol min−1 mg−1, respectively (28Kayne F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Ramírez-Silva L. Oria J. Gómez-Puyou A. Tuena de Gómez-Puyou M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The pioneer work of Boyer's group (30Reynard A.M. Hass L.F. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that at saturating concentration of K+, WT-PK follows a random order rapid equilibrium kinetic mechanism. This was later confirmed by other authors (31Mildvan A.S. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1178-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ainsworth S. MacFarlane N. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In our initial kinetic studies carried out in the absence of K+, we observed that the affinity of ADP-Mg2+ depended on the concentration of PEP, indicating that in the absence of K+, the binding of PEP affects that of ADP-Mg2+. Thus, we explored the kinetic behavior of the enzyme without K+. Initial velocities of the reaction of WT-PK were determined without and with K+ at variable concentrations of one of the substrates and at fixed variable concentrations of the other (Fig. 1). In the absence of K+, the double reciprocal plots of initial velocities versus PEP concentrations intersected above the 1/S axis and to the left of the 1/v axis, (Fig. 1A). With ADP-Mg2+ concentrations as variable substrate, the lines intersected on the 1/v axis and above the 1/S axis (Fig. 1B). Hence, the data indicate a rapid equilibrium sequential ordered mechanism with PEP as the first substrate. In the presence of K+ (Fig. 1, C and D), the families of lines intersect on the 1/S axis and to the left of the 1/v axis with either substrate; this indicates an ordered or random kinetic mechanism that is in rapid equilibrium or steady state. The data of WT-PK in the absence of K+ in 100% water were globally fitted to the equation that describes a rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism. In consonance with Boyer's report (30Reynard A.M. Hass L.F. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the data at saturating concentrations of K+ in aqueous medium were fitted to a rapid equilibrium random order mechanism.

These results are in consonance with reports that show that K+ increases the activity and affinity of the enzyme for substrates and Mg2+ (15Nowak T. Mildvan A.S.

Initial Velocity Studies without K+of WT-PK in 40% Me2SO and of E117K-PKin Aqueous Medium—The dependence of WT-PK catalysis on K+ is mimicked by modification of the solvent and by mutation of the enzyme (21Ramírez-Silva L.

Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3267-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the activity of WT-PK is 1000-fold higher than in aqueous medium without K+ (0.02 versus 20 μmol min−1 mg−1). Kinetic and spectroscopic studies show that the conformation of PK without K+ in 40% Me2SO resembles the conformation of the enzyme in aqueous medium with K+. By the same token, it has been shown that PK from various sources does not require K+ for catalysis (33Busto F. Del Valle P. Soler J. Biochem.

Biophys. 1997; 348: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) compared the sequences of WT-PK with K+ -independent PK from two bacteria. These authors found that Glu117 in the rabbit enzyme is a Lys in the bacterial enzymes. Thus, they changed Glu117 of rabbit PK for Lys and found that the E117K mutant (E117K-PK) exhibits a K+-independent activity of 30 μmol min−1 mg−1; it is not activated by K+. The authors indicated that Lys provides an internal positive charge that obviates the need for an exogenous monovalent cation. Initial velocity experiments were carried out without K+ in 40% Me2SO (w/v) with WT-PK and in 100% water with E117K-PK (experiments not shown). In both cases, the double reciprocal plots were identical to those obtained in the wild type enzyme in 100% water with K+. The data were globally fitted to the equation that describes a random order kinetic mechanism (TABLE ONE). In the absence of K+, the Vmax of WT-PK in 40% Me2SO and of E117K-PK were 30-fold (25 versus 0.8 μmol min−1 mg−1) and 50-fold (41 versus 0.8 μmol min−1 mg−1) higher than the Vmax of WT-PK in 100% water without K+. In the data of TABLE ONE, it is relevant that the Km values and catalytic efficiencies for the WT-PK with K+ in 100% water, 40% Me2SO without K+, and the E117K-PK in 100% water without K+ are similar. However, the values are drastically different from those of WT-PK in 100% water without K+. For example, the Km for ADP-Mg2+ in WT-PK without K+ is 14.1 mm, whereas in the other conditions, it is around 2 mm. Likewise, log kcat/Km is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher for the enzyme in the first three experimental conditions than for the enzyme without K+ in aqueous medium. In summary, these data indicate that the characteristics of the active site in Me2SO or the mutant resemble those of the enzyme in the presence of K+. It has been shown that in the absence of K+, 40% Me2SO induces the acquisition of the active conformation of WT-PK (21Ramírez-Silva L. Ferreira S.T. Nowak T. Tuena de Gómez-Puyou M. Gómez-Puyou A.

Dead End Inhibition Studies—Dead end inhibitors are powerful tools to probe the kinetic mechanisms of enzymes (39Cleland W.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1970: 1-65Google Scholar). Here we used oxalate and ADP-Cr2+ as dead end analogues of PEP (40Reed G.H. Morgan S.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3537-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and of ADP-Mg2+ (41Gupta R.K. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8878-8896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively (experiments not shown). In the absence of K+, the patterns of oxalate inhibition versus PEP and ADP-Mg2+ were competitive and noncompetitive, respectively. With ADP-Cr2+ the inhibition was uncompetitive and competitive with PEP and ADP-Mg2+, respectively. With K+, the patterns of oxalate inhibition versus PEP and ADP-Mg2+ were competitive and noncompetitive, respectively, whereas with ADP-Cr2+, the inhibition was noncompetitive and competitive with respect to PEP and ADP-Mg2+. In all cases, replots of the slopes or intersects of double reciprocal plots against inhibitor concentration were linear (not shown). The data were globally fitted to the equations that describe linear competitive inhibition, linear noncompetitive inhibition, linear mixed inhibition, or linear uncompetitive inhibition. The inhibition patterns and calculated inhibition constants are shown in TABLE TWO.TABLE TWODead end inhibition patterns and inhibition constants for oxalate and ADP-Cr2+ in WT-PK and in E117K-PKDead end analog of PEP:oxalateDead end analog of ADP-Mg2+:ADP-Cr2+Ki (oxalate)Ki (ADP-Cr2+)1/v versus 1/PEP, fixed ADP-Mg2+1/v versus 1/ADP-Mg2+, fixed PEP1/v versus 1/PEP, fixed ADP-Mg2+1/v versus 1/ADP-Mg2+, fixed PEPμmmmWT-PK, 100% H2O with K+CNCNCC29 ± 1.81.3 ± 0.06WT-PK, 100% H2O without K+CNCUC77 ± 3.22.8 ± 0.06E117K-PK, 100% H2O without K+CMTNCC4.8 ± 0.2.9 ± 0.08WT-PK, 40% Me2SO without K+CNCNCC2.4 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Collectively, the data show that with or without K+, oxalate is a competitive inhibitor with respect to PEP, whereas ADP-Cr2+ is a competitive inhibitor of ADP-Mg2+. This indicates that analogues and substrates bind to the same site. Because with or without K+, oxalate is a noncompetitive inhibitor of ADP-Mg2+, it may be concluded that oxalate forms a nonproductive ternary complex and thereby diminishes Vmax, without altering the binding of ADP-Mg2+. The same argument holds for ADP-Cr2+ with respect to PEP in the presence of K+. On the other hand, with PEP in the absence of K+, the inhibition pattern by ADP-Cr2+ was uncompetitive, illustrating that ADP-Cr2+ binds exclusively to the enzyme-PEP binary complex. The uncompetitive pattern confirms the data of Fig. 1 and TABLE ONE that show that in the absence of K+, WT-PK followed a sequential rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism. In contrast, the overall kinetics in the presence of K+ (substrates binding independently) confirm previous reports (30Reynard A.M. Hass L.F. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Mildvan A.S. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1178-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ainsworth S. MacFarlane N. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that show that the kinetic mechanism of WT-PK involves a rapid equilibrium random order. The inhibition patterns in the absence of K+ of WT-PK in 40% Me2SO medium and of E117K-PK in 100% water followed the same patterns as those of WT-PK with K+, except that a mixed type pattern with α < 1 for oxalate inhibition versus ADP-Mg2+ was observed (TABLE TWO). This difference indicated that the enzyme-oxalate binary complex has a higher affinity for ADP-Mg2+ than the free enzyme. Therefore, the data with dead end inhibitors indicate that in the absence of K+, WT-PK in medium 40% Me2SO or E117K-PK in 100% water follow a rapid equilibrium random order kinetic mechanism. The data of TABLES ONE and TWO show that K+ increases the affinity of the enzyme for the inhibitors and the substrates. Thus, it is noteworthy that WT-PK in medium with 40% Me2SO or in the mutation E117K in 100% water, the affinity for the inhibitors is higher than that of PK in water plus K+ (TABLE TWO). Along this line, it is relevant that Reed et al. (40Reed G.H. Morgan S.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3537-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported that oxalate is an analogue of"

Recently, it has been demonstrated that during atherogenesis the extracellular pH of atherosclerotic lesions decreases. We have examined the effect of the decreased pH on the binding of LDL to human aortic proteoglycans. The binding of native, oxidized, proteolyzed (α-chymotrypsin-treated), or lipolyzed (sphingomyelinase- or phospholipase A2-treated) LDL particles to proteoglycans were measured in microtiter well assays at pH 5.5–7.5. We found that the lower the pH, the higher the amount of binding of LDL to proteoglycans. At the lowest pH tested (pH 5.5), the amounts of proteoglycan-bound native, proteolyzed, sphingomyelinase-, and phospholipase A2-treated LDL were 20-, 23-, 30-, and 37-fold higher, respectively, than at pH 7.5. Interestingly, although oxidized LDL failed to bind to proteoglycans at neutral pH, there was significant binding at acidic pH. Binding of native and modified LDL to proteoglycans at pH 5.5 was blocked by 1 m NaCl, indicating that at neutral pH LDL binds to proteoglycans via ionic interactions. Inhibition of this binding by acetylation and cyclohexanedione treatment of LDL showed that the positively charged amino acids of apolipoprotein B-100, lysine, and arginine, respectively, mediated the ionic interaction. Taken together, our results suggest that in areas of atherosclerotic arterial intima where the extracellular pH decreases, retention of LDL by proteoglycans is enhanced, leading to extracellular accumulation of LDL and progression of the disease.

A role for LDL retention in experimental atherosclerosis has been directly demonstrated in mice expressing proteoglycan binding-defective human apoB-100. In these transgenic mice, formation of early atherosclerotic plaques is significantly decreased (9Boren J. Gustafsson M. Skålen K. Flood C. Innerarity T.L. Curr. Opin.

Pentikäinen M.O. Ala-Korpela M. Kovanen P.T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1703-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, intimal LDL particles show signs of proteolysis, phospholipolysis, and oxidation, and intimal lipid droplets have features that suggest they are formed from modified LDL particles (11Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Ala-Korpela M. Kovanen P.T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1703-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolysis, phospholipolysis, and oxidation induce changes in the surface monolayer of LDL particles. Sphingomyelinase (SMase) hydrolyzes sphingomyelin molecules to water soluble phosphocholine and ceramide, whereas phospholipase A2 (PLA2) hydrolyzes fatty acid esters of diacylglycerol phospholipids to form lysophosphatidylcholine and fatty acids. Oxidation induces changes in both the protein and lipid components of LDL particles. Thus, lipid peroxides are formed that decompose further into aldehydes capable of reacting with apoB-100 and ultimately lead to cleavage of apoB-100 into peptides. Based on their structural differences at different stages of atherogenesis, atherosclerotic plaques are classified as early, intermediate, advanced, and complicated lesions (12Stary H.C.

Recently, other variables of the advancing lesions have also been described and related to the structural differences of the plaques. Plaques show heterogeneity both in temperature (15Casscells W.

This is as expected because atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease (17Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6936) Google Scholar), and it is known that in areas in which inflammation takes place, the temperature rises and the pH decreases (18Leake D.S. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 129: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Macrophages, which are abundant in atherosclerotic lesions, can substantially acidify their surroundings by extruding hydrogen ions (18Leake D.S. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 129: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, in advanced atherosclerotic plaques there are hypoxic areas (19Björnheden T. Levin M. Evaldsson M. Wiklund O. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) in which cells may suffer from ischemia and therefore, to generate ATP, convert glucose into lactate, which once secreted will locally decrease the extracellular pH. In the present study we have examined the effect of low pH on the binding of LDL particles to human aortic proteoglycans. In addition, we have proteolyzed, lipolyzed, and oxidized LDL and examined the binding of these modified particles to proteoglycans at different pH values. Isolation and Modifications of LDL—Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.050 g/ml) was isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers (n = 8) by sequential ultracentrifugation in the presence of 3 mm EDTA (20Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Radding C.M. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Investig. 1960; 39: 1560-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The amounts of LDL are expressed in terms of their protein concentrations, which were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Each experiment was performed with LDL from at least two donors. LDL (1 mg/ml) was incubated in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) containing 2% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA, MP Chemicals) with 0.5 mg/ml of α-chymotrypsin (α-CT) (Sigma), 50 milliunits/ml of sphingomyelinase (Sigma), or 0.5 μg/ml of phospholipase A2 (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, proteolysis was stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 mm, and lipolysis was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. The degree of proteolysis was determined with SDS-PAGE, and the degrees of lipolysis were determined by thin layer chromatography, as described previously (23Hakala J.K. Oksjoki R. Laine P. Du H. Grabowski G.A. Kovanen P.T. Pentikäinen M.O. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). LDL (1 mg/ml) was oxidized by 5 μm copper sulfate in phosphate-buffered saline for 1, 3, 6, or 18 h at 37 °C. The degree of oxidation was determined by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (24Hessler J.R. Morel D.W. Lewis L.J. Chisolm G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 215-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and reactive lysine residues (ϵ-amino groups of lysine residues) (25Habeeb A.F. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). Lysine and arginine residues of LDL were modified by treatment with acetic anhydride (26Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) or 1,2-cyclohexanedione (20Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), respectively. The degree of aggregation/fusion in the modified LDL samples was determined by gel filtration in Superose 6 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation and Characterization of Aortic Proteoglycans—Proteoglycans from the intima-media of human aortas were obtained at autopsy within 24 h of accidental death and were prepared essentially by the method of Hurt-Camejo et al. (27Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Rosengren B. Lopez F. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1387-1398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (28Öörni K.

Glycosaminoglycans were quantified by the method of Bartold and Page (29Bartold P.M. Page R.C. Anal.

Binding of LDL to Human Aortic Proteoglycans—The wells of polystyrene 96-well plates (Thermo Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland) were coated with 100 μl of human aortic proteoglycans (50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) by incubation at 4 °C overnight. Wells were blocked with 3% BSA, 1% fat-free milk powder, and 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37°C.Wells without proteoglycans served as controls. 100 μl of LDL (0.1 mg/ml) in a buffer containing 1% BSA, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2 and either 20 mm MES (pH 5.5 or 6.0), 20 mm PIPES (pH 6.5 or 7.0), or 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) was incubated in the wells for 1 h at 37°C, unbound LDL was removed, the wells were washed with MES, PIPES, or HEPES buffered 50 mm saline, and the amounts of bound LDL were determined using the Amplex Red cholesterol kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). The amount of bound LDL is expressed as μg of LDL protein/well, which was calculated from the amounts of cholesterol (2.7 nmol of cholesterol/μg of LDL protein). To determine the difference in the binding of unaggregated and slightly aggregated SMase-modified LDL particles to human aortic proteoglycans, LDL was first treated with SMase (50 milliunits/ml) at 15 °C for 1 h. Lipolysis was stopped with 10 mm EDTA, and half of the sample was incubated for a further 2 h at 37 °C, while the other half was kept at 15 °C. The binding of LDL to proteoglycans was determined by incubating the modified LDL particles in proteoglycan- or BSA-coated microtiter wells overnight at 4 °C. The effect of pH on the binding of LDL to human aortic proteoglycans was examined in microtiter well assays at pH ranges 5.5–7.5. For this purpose, the wells were coated with the proteoglycans with BSA-coated wells serving as controls. LDL was incubated in the proteoglycan- or BSA-coated wells, the unbound LDL was removed, and the amount of bound LDL was measured. As shown in Fig. 1, the lower the pH, the higher the binding of LDL to proteoglycans. Next, LDL was modified proteolytically with α-CT or lipolytically with SMase or PLA2. α-CT degrades the apoB-100 of LDL particles, whereas SMase cleaves the sphingomyelin and PLA2 the phosphatidylcholine molecules of the particle surface. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that apoB-100 of the α-CT-treated LDL was completely degraded. Thin layer chromatographic analysis revealed that SMase treatment led to complete hydrolysis of the sphingomyelin molecules, and that PLA2 treatment led to hydrolysis of over 90% of LDL phosphatidylcholine molecules (not shown). The extensively hydrolyzed LDL particles were next applied to proteoglycan- or BSA-coated microtiter wells, and the binding of the modified particles to them was determined at pH 5.5–7.5. As shown in Fig. 1, the same trend as with native LDL was also seen with modified LDL, the lower the pH, the higher the amount of binding. Moreover, when compared with the binding of native LDL, proteolytic and lipolytic modifications increased the amount of proteoglycan-bound LDL by ∼1.5- and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 1). Aggregation and fusion of proteolyzed and lipolyzed LDL particles has been shown to enhance the binding of LDL to proteoglycans. In this study, short incubation times were used to minimize aggregation and fusion of the modified particles. Indeed, proteolyzed or PLA2-treated LDL showed no evidence of aggregation/fusion when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 column. However, SMase-treated LDL was already slightly aggregated after the 1-h incubation used in this study. To determine whether the increase in the binding of SMase-treated LDL depended on aggregation of the particles, we next performed an experiment where particle aggregation was inhibited by performing the incubations at 15 °C. At this temperature, aggregation of SMase-modified LDL does not occur (30Paananen K. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2023-2031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 1 h, lipolysis was stopped with EDTA, and half of the sample was further incubated for 2 h at 37°Candthe other half at 15 °C. After the incubations, the modified LDL particles were applied to proteoglycan- or BSA-coated microtiter wells and incubated at 4 °C at pH 5.5. The incubation temperature (either 37 or 15 °C) did not affect the binding of native LDL to human aortic proteoglycans (Fig. 2). In contrast, the amount of SMase-treated, proteoglycan-bound LDL depended on the incubation temperature. An increase in the amount of proteoglycan-bound LDL was observed only if SMase-treated LDL was incubated at a temperature that allowed particle aggregation/fusion (37 °C). It is known that, at neutral pH, oxidation strongly decreases the binding of LDL to human aortic proteoglycans (28Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21303-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To study the effect of pH on the binding of oxidized LDL particles, LDL was first treated with copper sulfate for various periods of time and the degree of oxidation determined by measuring the amount of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. As shown in Fig. 3A, the degree of oxidation increased progressively. The degree of lysine modification was also determined and it was found that after oxidation for 18 h, ∼0.5 of the lysine residues had become modified (not shown). Binding of oxidized LDL particles to proteoglycans was then measured using the microtiter well assay. Oxidation progressively decreased the binding of LDL to proteoglycans at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3B). However, at pH 5.5, even the extensively oxidized LDL (oxidation for 18 h) was able to bind to proteoglycans. In fact, at pH 5.5, the amount of extensively oxidized LDL bound to proteoglycans was 3-fold higher than the amount of native LDL at pH 7.5. The binding of LDL to proteoglycans is mediated by ionic interactions between the positively charged amino acids lysine and arginine of the apoB-100 of LDL particles and the negatively charged glycosaminoglycans of proteoglycans (31Iverius P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2607-2613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the binding of LDL to proteoglycans is mediated by ionic interactions also at low pH, we next performed a binding assay in the presence of 1 m NaCl. The effect of high salt concentration is seen in Fig. 4A. 1 m NaCl completely blocked the binding of LDL to proteoglycans, showing that the binding occurs via ionic interactions also at low pH. Next, the role of lysine and arginine residues in the binding of LDL to proteoglycans was determined at low pH. Acetylation of LDL neutralizes the positive charge of lysine residues (26Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and cyclohexanedione treatment neutralizes the positive charge of arginine residues (20Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and each modification impairs the binding of LDL to proteoglycans at neutral pH. In this experiment LDL was first acetylated or treated with cyclohexanedione after which LDL was further treated with α-CT, SMase, or PLA2. Acetylation or cyclohexanedione treatment did not have significant effect on the abilities of α-CT, SMase, or PLA2 to hydrolyze the lipoproteins. As shown in Fig. 4B, acetylation completely blocked the binding of native and modified LDL at pH 5.5, although cyclohexanedione treatment blocked only the binding of unmodified LDL and only slightly decreased the binding of proteolyzed and SMase-modified LDL, whereas it did not affect the binding of PLA2-modified LDL. One possibility for the difference is that during proteolysis and lipolysis, the conformation of apoB-100 becomes changed, so leading to exposure of unmodified arginine residues. To ensure that the result did not depend on this, we next performed an experiment, where LDL was first proteolyzed or lipolyzed and only then acetylated or treated with cyclohexanedione (Fig. 4C). In accordance with the previous experiment, acetylation completely blocked the binding of native, α-CT-, SMase- and PLA2-modified LDL to proteoglycans. Cyclohexanedione treatment again fully blocked the binding of native LDL to proteoglycans but only partially blocked the binding of proteolyzed or lipolyzed LDL to proteoglycans. These findings suggest that although the arginine residues in apoB-100 are needed for binding of native LDL to proteoglycans, they are not critical for binding of proteolyzed or lipolyzed LDL to proteoglycans at acidic pH. The high concentration of LDL particles in the arterial intima results from their selective retention in the intima (33Schwenke D.C. Carew T.E. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 895-907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Schwenke D.C. Carew T.E. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 908-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Tozer E.C. Carew T.E. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), proteoglycans playing an important role in this process by binding LDL particles that have entered the intimal space (10Skålen K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hulten L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Boren J. Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). At neutral pH, however, native LDL is known to have a relatively low affinity for proteoglycans (4Camejo G. Hurt-Camejo E. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 205-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We have observed that proteolytic and phospholipolytic modifications of LDL enhance the binding of LDL to proteoglycans, especially if the modified LDL particles are aggregated/fused (reviewed byÖörni et al. (11Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Ala-Korpela M. Kovanen P.T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1703-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Here, we show that a decrease in pH also enhances the binding of native LDL to human aortic proteoglycans and that the enhancement is even more pronounced for proteolyzed and PLA2- and SMase-treated lipoproteins. In this experimental setup, LDL particles were first proteolyzed or lipolyzed at pH 7.4, after which the reactions were stopped by adding enzyme inhibitors. Thus, the degree of proteolytic and lipolytic modification was identical at the start of the binding experiments. Moreover, we aimed at conditions in which aggregation of the modified LDL particles was as minimal as possible. Under these conditions, SMase treatment induced slight aggregation of LDL and, in fact, the enhanced binding of SMase-treated LDL to proteoglycans was found to depend on particle aggregation. In contrast, proteolysis and PLA2 treatment were found to enhance the binding of LDL to proteoglycans without particle aggregation. Atherosclerotic plaques show heterogeneity in temperature (15Casscells W. Hathorn B. David M. Krabach T. Vaughn W.K. McAllister H.A. Bearman G. Willerson J.T.

Willerson J.T. Casscells W. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 164: 27-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Indeed, the hydrogen ion concentration in lipid-rich, vulnerable areas is over 10-fold higher than that in calcified areas of plaques (16Naghavi M. John R. Naguib S. Siadaty M.S. Grasu R. Kurian K.C. van Winkle W.B. Soller B. Litovsky S. Madjid M. Willerson J.T. Casscells W. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 164: 27-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The decreased pH is likely the result of the metabolic activity of macrophages in the lesions, because macrophages can acidify their surroundings by extruding hydrogen ions (18Leake D.S. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 129: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by the finding of De Vries et al. (37De Vries H.E. Ronken E. Reinders J.H. Buchner B. Van Berkel T.J. Kuiper J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 111-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who have shown that in the presence of oxidized LDL macrophages can acidify their environment to pH 5.5. In addition, under hypoxic conditions metabolically active macrophages secrete high amounts of lactate (38Newsholme P. Gordon S. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Indeed, advanced atherosclerotic lesions show signs of hypoxia (19Björnheden T. Levin M. Evaldsson M. Wiklund O. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) with neovascularization of the plaques being a clear sign of local oxygen deprivation (39Kamat B.R. Galli S.J. Barger A.C. Lainey L.L. Silverman K.J. Hum. Pathol. 1987; 18: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Atherosclerotic arterial intima contains several proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes potentially capable of degrading LDL particles in the extracellular milieu of the tissue either at neutral or at acidic pH. Thus, chymase, matrix metalloproteases, and cysteine proteases, all found in atherosclerotic lesions, can degrade apoB-100 in LDL particles in vitro (reviewed byÖörni et al. (11Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Ala-Korpela M. Kovanen P.T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1703-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Of these proteases, cathepsin F is especially potent in degrading apoB-100 in LDL particles and has been shown to enhance the binding of LDL to proteoglycans in vitro (40Öörni K. Sneck M. Brömme D. Pentikäinen M.O. Lindstedt K.A. Mäyränpää M. Aitio H. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34776-34784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Of the extracellularly found intimal phospholipases both types IIa PLA2 and V PLA2 are able to hydrolyze LDL particles, type V being especially active toward the phosphocholines in LDL particles (41Wooton-Kee C.R. Boyanovsky B.B. Nasser M.S. de Villiers W.J. Webb N.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 42Sartipy P. Camejo G. Svensson L. Hurt-Camejo E.

Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Secretory SMase does not hydrolyze sphingomyelins of LDL particles at neutral pH unless the particles have been premodified e.g. with PLA2 (44Schissel S.L. Jiang X. Tweedie-Hardman J. Jeong T. Camejo E.H. Najib J. Rapp J.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2738-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, at acidic pH SMase readily hydrolyzes LDL. Interestingly, several studies have also indicated that oxidation of LDL is enhanced at acidic pH (reviewed by Leake (18Leake D.S. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 129: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)). At neutral pH, oxidation has been shown to decrease the binding of LDL to proteoglycans (28Öörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21303-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and even to induce release of bound LDL from glycosaminoglycans (45Pentikäinen M.O. Öörni K. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1902-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The decreased binding of oxidized LDL results from the neutralization of the lysine residues of apoB-100 during oxidation. Interestingly, in the present work we found that oxidation decreased the binding of LDL to proteoglycans at acidic pH. Importantly, however, despite this decrease the binding of extensively oxidized LDL at pH 5.5 was still 3-fold higher than binding of native LDL to proteoglycans at neutral pH (see Fig. 3). In this extensively oxidized LDL, approximately half of the lysine residues had become modified during oxidation implying that the remaining half of the lysine residues mediated the binding to proteoglycans. Based on the above findings, we can speculate that provided unbound LDL becomes oxidized in an acidic extracellular compartment of the arterial intima, the oxidized particles may bind to proteoglycans and so contribute to the extracellular accumulation of cholesterol rather than being ingested by macrophages, as would occur if the pH is neutral (45Pentikäinen M.O. Öörni K. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1902-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that native, proteolyzed, and lipolyzed LDL binds to proteoglycans via ionic interactions at acidic pH. Neutralization of the lysine residues of apoB-100 by acetylation blocked the binding of native, proteolyzed, and lipolyzed LDL to proteoglycans, and neutralization of the arginine residues by cyclohexanedione modification blocked the binding of native LDL to proteoglycans, even at low pH. If the arginine residues were neutralized, however, the proteolyzed or lipolyzed LDL particles were able to bind to proteoglycans at pH values below 6.0, revealing that the arginine residues of apoB-100 had a minor role, if any, in the binding of proteolyzed or lipolyzed LDL to proteoglycans in this pH range. One possible explanation for this is that during proteolysis and lipolysis, conformational changes in apoB-100 reveal new binding sites where arginine residues are not critically positioned in terms of apoB-100-proteoglycan interaction. In fact, PLA2 treatment has been shown to alter the conformation of apoB-100 in LDL particles (46Kleinman Y. Krul E.S. Burnes M. Aronson W. Pfleger B. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 729-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Asatryan L. Hamilton R.T. Isas J.M. Hwang J. Kayed R. Sevanian A. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment of LDL with SMase, especially when SMase-treated particles become aggregated, may lead to changes in the conformation of apoB-100. Finally, extensive proteolysis of apoB-100, which leads to the release of peptide fragments from LDL, is also likely to lead to spatial rearrangements of the remaining peptide fragments. Indeed, at neutral pH, an increase in the affinity of LDL for proteoglycans after treatment with PLA2 has been shown to depend on the exposure of a new binding site in apoB-100 (32Flood C. Gustafsson M. Pitas R.E. Arnaboldi L. Walzem R.L. Boren J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a decrease in pH appeared to have an additional effect on the conformation of apoB-100, because arginine residues were critical for the binding of proteolyzed and lipolyzed LDL to proteoglycans at pH 6.5–7.5, but not at pH 5.5–6.0. The results of this study show that the affinity of LDL to proteoglycans increases as the pH decreases and that this affinity can be further increased if LDL particles are modified by proteolysis and phospholipolysis. Regarding the pathophysiology of the pH effect on LDL binding to intimal proteoglycans, the following points merit a comment. In advanced lesions, acidic environments develop in the deeper hypoxic areas whereas the pH of the subendothelial space is still close to neutral. Because LDL particles enter the intima by crossing the luminal endothelium and are then convected toward the deeper areas by the moving interstitial fluid, the particles are first exposed to neutral pH and only later to acidic pH. Accordingly, in the subendothelial neutral environment LDL particles are more likely to become modified by the neutral proteases and phospholipases, whereas in the deeper areas they are attacked by enzymes, which function optimally at acidic pH. Based on these findings, we suggest that a decrease in pH is a novel promoter in the processes that lead to enhanced retention of LDL in advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

https://openalex.org/W2032412054,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 promotes apoptosis in response to death stimuli by transactivation of target genes and by transcription-independent mechanisms. Recently, it was shown that during apoptosis p53 can specifically translocate to mitochondria, where it physically interacts with and inactivates prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins. In the present study, we therefore investigated the role of mitochondrial translocation of p53 for the stress response of tumor cells. In various cell lines, DNA damage induced by either ionizing irradiation or topoisomerase inhibitors triggered a robust translocation of a fraction of p53 to mitochondria to a similar extent. Nevertheless, the cells succumbed to apoptosis only in response to topoisomerase inhibitors, but remained resistant to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation. Irradiated cells became senescent, although irradiation triggered a functional p53 response and induced expression of p21, Bax, and Puma. Interestingly, even the targeted expression of p53 to mitochondria was insufficient to launch apoptosis, whereas overexpression of wild-type p53 induced Bax activation and apoptotic alterations. Together, these results suggest that, in contrast to previous reports, mitochondrial translocation of p53 does not per se lead to cell death and that this might constitute a mechanism that contributes to the resistance of tumor cells to ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is an important cellular integrator of stresses that triggers cell cycle arrest, senescence, DNA repair, or apoptosis. Upon activation by DNA damage or other stress-induced signaling pathways, p53 promotes the expression of a huge number of genes that coordinate the cellular stress response (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5848) Google Scholar, 2Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar, 3Bargonetti J.

The importance of p53 for the maintenance of genomic integrity and prevention of tumorigenesis becomes evident by the fact that p53 is mutated and thereby inactivated in nearly 50% of all malignant human tumors (5Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7478) Google Scholar, 6Vousden K.H. Prives C. Cell. 2005; 120: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These mutations are primarily point mutations, and more than 90% of them are located within the central DNA-binding domain, underscoring the crucial role of p53 as a nuclear transcription factor (7Olivier M. Eeles R. Hollstein M. Khan M.A. Harris C.C. Hainaut P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). As various apoptosis-relevant genes are under the control of p53, induction of apoptosis by p53 was initially believed to be mainly because of its function as a transcription factor. Furthermore, especially in view of the fact that p53 controls expression of death receptors such as CD95/Fas/APO1 or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2/KILLER/DR5), apoptosis induced by p53 was attributed to the extrinsic death receptor pathway (8Owen-Schaub L.B. Zhang W. Cusack J.C. Angelo L.S. Santee S.M. Fujiwara T. Roth J.A. Deisseroth A.B. Zhang W.W. Kruzel E. Radinsky R. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Soon it became evident, however, that p53 mediates cell death predominantly via the intrinsic death pathway, because cells deficient for crucial components of this pathway such as Apaf-1 or caspase-9 were shown to be highly resistant to p53-dependent apoptosis (11Soengas M.S. Alarcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway is initiated through the release of pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondria, including cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO (12Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Released cytochrome c then allows the formation of a high-molecular weight complex, the apoptosome, containing Apaf-1 and caspase-9, that initiates the activation of the caspase cascade. Apoptotic signaling events at the level of the mitochondria are tightly controlled by pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins including Bax, Bak, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and others. These Bcl-2 proteins interact with another group of pro-apoptotic proteins that share at least one common motif with Bcl-2, namely the BH3-domain. BH3-only proteins have been proposed to be allosteric regulators of the Bcl-2 proteins and serve as sensors of apoptotic signaling. Upon interaction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins with BH3-only proteins, both Bax and Bak undergo a conformational change in response to apoptotic stimuli. This event, which mediates exposure of an occluded N terminus (13Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 14Desagher S.

Interestingly, many pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members, including, for instance, Bax and the BH3-only proteins Puma, Noxa, and Bid, are under the transcriptional control of p53 (15Miyashita T. Kitada S.

In addition to the transcriptional role of p53, there is now accumulating evidence for transcription-independent, p53-mediated apoptotic pathways (20Moll U.M. Zaika A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Chipuk J.E. Green D.R. J. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 23: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Erster S. Moll U.M.

In some cell types, for example, p53-dependent apoptosis occurs in the absence of any gene transcription or translation or even upon expression of transcriptionally inactive p53 mutants (24Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 25Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Kazaz A. Vousden K. Oren M.

The precise molecular mechanisms, however, of how p53 induces apoptosis independently of its transcriptional activity are largely unknown. Intriguingly, p53 has been reported to directly induce mitochondrial cytochrome c release in a Bax-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro, providing evidence for a direct signaling pathway from the p53 protein to the downstream caspase activation cascade (27Schuler M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Goldstein J.C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7337-7342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). These observations were further supported by recent findings demonstrating the appearance of p53 in the cytoplasm or even its translocation to the mitochondria during DNA damage- and stress-induced apoptosis (28Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 29Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Moll and co-workers also found that bypassing the nucleus by targeting p53 expression directly to the mitochondria was sufficient to induce cell death in p53-deficient tumor cells (30Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). As a mechanistic explanation, it was proposed that p53, like BH3-only proteins, directly induces the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane by forming inhibitory complexes with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL proteins. Green and colleagues (28Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax is one of the principal cytoplasmic targets of p53 (28Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). In a comparable scenario, a direct interaction of p53 with mitochondria-localized Bak rather than Bax was proposed that results in the disruption of the cyto-protective Mcl-1·Bak complex and hence in the oligomerization and activation of Bak (31Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Thus, compelling evidence suggests that p53 directly impacts on mitochondria, although it is still a matter of debate by which route the transcription-independent apoptosis is achieved. We have previously reported that MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells are sensitive to anti-cancer drug-induced apoptosis, but are remarkably resistant to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation (IR) 2The abbreviations used are:FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter.IRionizing radiationsiRNAsmall interfering RNAPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidHMG1high mobility group 1wtwild-type regardless of whether or not they express caspase-3 (32Jänicke R.U.

This finding was especially paradox because MCF-7 cells express a transcriptionally active wild-type p53 protein. Thus, we wondered whether the radio-resistant phenotype of these cells might be caused by an improper transcription-independent function of p53. We found that, although IR induced an efficient translocation of p53 to the mitochondria, this process was insufficient to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 and HCT116 carcinoma cells. In addition, in several cell lines that display different apoptosis susceptibilities toward IR or chemotherapeutics, we did not find a correlation between the amount of mitochondrial p53 and apoptosis induction. Interestingly, Bax oligomerization and apoptotic alterations were only observed when cells were transfected with wild-type p53, whereas the expression of p53 targeted directly to the mitochondria did not evoke an apoptotic response. Our results therefore suggest that the resistance to apoptosis induction by mitochondrial p53 might contribute to the radio-resistant phenotype of tumor cells. ionizing radiation small interfering RNA proliferating cell nuclear antigen green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid high mobility group 1 wild-type Cells, Reagents, and Antibodies—MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells and its subclones MCF-7/casp-3 (33Jänicke R.U.

The human B-lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4 and RKO colon carcinoma cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively. All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 10 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml of each streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Cölbe, Germany). The HCT116 and HCT116/p53-/- cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented as above. The monoclonal Chk1 antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany), and the monoclonal p53 antibody (Ab-6) from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). The p21 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase monoclonal antibodies were from BD Pharmingen, and the polyclonal antibody to high mobility group 1 (HMG1) and the monoclonal antibody to Tom20 from BD Bioscience.

For protease inhibition, buffers were supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Treatment and Transfection of Cells—Cells were exposed to ionizing radiation at the indicated dose using a Gammacell 1000 Elite (Nordion International Inc., Fleurus, Belgium) in the presence or absence of caffeine (1 mm, Sigma). Alternatively, cells were treated with the topoisomerase inhibitors etoposide (10 μm) or camptothecin (5 μm; both Sigma). The term “radio-resistant” that is used throughout the entire manuscript refers to “resistant to IR-induced apoptosis.” Transfections of MCF-7 cells were performed with FuGENE reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). Mammalian expression vectors encoding for wild-type p53 (p53wt) or a p53 fused to the transmembrane domain of Bcl-2 (p53-CTM) were published before (30Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence staining, cells were seeded on coverslides. At the indicated time points, cells were fixed for 20 min in ice-cold PBS containing 2% formaldehyde. Blocking and all following procedures were performed in PBS supplemented with 4% BSA and 0.05% saponin. Primary antibodies were applied at 4 °C overnight at the appropriate concentration. Then, cells were washed three times for 20 min and incubated with the secondary antibody (1:500). Finally, samples were washed extensively and mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Corporation, Carpintera, CA) with or without 10 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Pictures were taken on an Axiovert 135 Microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with an Apochromat ×63 oil immersion lens using OpenLab software (Improvision, Tübingen, Germany). Flow Cytometric Analysis—For cell cycle analysis and detection of apoptosis, samples were prepared according to Nicoletti et al. (37Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in cold PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. All flow cytometric analyses were performed on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) by using CellQuest analysis software. For each determination a minimum of 10,000 cells was analyzed. Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Staining—Staining for β-galactosidase activity was performed as previously described (38Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E.

Briefly, after the indicated treatment cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde for 5 min, washed again with PBS, and finally stained in the absence of CO2 in staining solution (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K2Fe(CN6), 40 mm citric acid, and 12 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0) containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. Cell Extracts and Subcellular Fractionation—Total cell extracts were prepared in high-salt lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 350 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. For isolation of mitochondria, cells were harvested by scraping, centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in ice-cold buffer MB (400 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, and 0.2% BSA). After incubation on ice for 20 min, cells were Dounce homogenized with 40 strokes, and unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g to pellet mitochondria. The resulting supernatant was removed and designated the cytoplasmic fraction, whereas the pellet enriched for mitochondria was resuspended in buffer MSM (300 mm mannitol, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% BSA) and was referred to as the M1 fraction. To obtain highly purified mitochondria, the M1 fraction was loaded onto a discontinuous 1.2-1.6 m sucrose gradient buffered with 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.1% BSA. After centrifugation at 70,000 × g for 1 h, the interphase was harvested and diluted in MSM buffer at a ratio of 1:4. Mitochondria were centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting pellet was designated M2. Western Blot Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology), and 15 μg of protein per lane were loaded onto standard SDS-PAGE gels and separated at 200 V. The proteins were transferred onto a 0.2-μm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Bioscience) by semi-dry blotting at a constant current of 40 mA for 90 min in a buffer containing 10 mm CAPS (pH 11) and 10% MeOH. The membranes were blocked in PBS containing 4% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h, followed by an overnight incubation with the primary antibody at 4 °C. After washing the membranes extensively, the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5000) were applied for 1 h. Membranes were washed for an additional 2 h in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and proteins were visualized using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Irradiation Induces a Functional p53 Response in the Absence of Apoptosis—The tumor suppressor p53 induces apoptosis in response to DNA damage in diverse cellular systems. Nevertheless, MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by IR regardless of whether or not they express caspase-3, although they harbor a functional p53 gene (32Jänicke R.U. Engels I.H. Dunkern T. Kaina B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Porter A.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5043-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Essmann F. Engels I.H. Totzke G. Schulze-Osthoff K. Jänicke R.U. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7065-7072Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Hence, we wondered whether the resistance of MCF-7 and MCF-7/casp-3 cells to IR-induced apoptosis could be caused by a mechanism rendering wild-type p53 unresponsive toward IR in these cells. However, exposure to IR induced significant p21 expression in both MCF-7 cell lines, a process that is most likely mediated via stabilization and transcriptional activation of p53 (Fig. 1A). In addition, irradiated MCF-7 and MCF-7/casp-3 cells displayed a persistent G2/M arrest (Fig. 1B) that correlated with the induction of cellular senescence as evidenced by staining of the senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and a dramatic increase in the cell volume (Fig. 1C). IR-induced senescence was substantially reduced in MCF-7 and MCF-7/casp-3 cells stably transfected with a p53siRNA construct (35Essmann F. Engels I.H. Totzke G. Schulze-Osthoff K. Jänicke R.U. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7065-7072Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), implying that senescence induction requires p53 expression in both cell lines (Fig. 1D). Together, these results demonstrate that the p53 protein expressed in MCF-7 cells is functionally active, at least with regard to its transcriptional activity. Mitochondrial Translocation of p53 in Response to Irradiation—Accumulating evidence suggests that p53 can also induce apoptosis via transcription-independent events that are only poorly understood. One of these events might be the DNA damage-induced translocation of p53 to the mitochondria that was previously described (29Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 30Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). To examine whether this process was a critical event for the apoptosis resistance of irradiated MCF-7 cells, we initially analyzed the subcellular localization of p53 by immunofluorescence microscopy. Compared with untreated cells, irradiation triggered an increase in nuclear size associated with the formation of micronuclei (Fig. 2A). Unlike expression of the nuclear HMG1 that remained unaffected by IR, p53 expression was barely detectable in untreated MCF-7 cells, but was highly induced in irradiated cells (Fig. 2A). However, IR-induced p53 was predominantly found in the nucleus, and no mitochondrial-associated p53 could be detected with this technique. Also the use of different antibodies recognizing either N- or C-terminal p53 epitopes did not result in the detection of endogenous mitochondria-associated p53 following IR (data not shown). Although this result would support our initial hypothesis that the radio-resistant phenotype of MCF-7 cells might be caused by an improper p53 function, our failure to detect mitochondrial translocation of endogenous p53 following exposure of the cells to IR might simply reflect the sensitivity restrictions of the immunofluorescence technique applied. Therefore, we investigated the possible IR-induced p53 translocation by Western blot analyses of mitochondria-enriched fractions. Using this technique, we found indeed a significant amount of p53 protein that was associated with mitochondria (M1 fraction) only in irradiated, but not in untreated MCF-7 or MCF-7/casp-3 cells (Fig. 2B). However, the mitochondria-enriched M1 fractions prepared by such a method might be contaminated with diverse membrane particles and organelles including endoplasmic reticulum and other subcellular compartments. In addition, we had to rule out the possibility that the M1 fractions contained also nuclear or cytoplasmic p53 that was not specifically translocated to mitochondria during IR treatment in vivo, but was simply co-sedimented during the purification procedure. Western blot analyses revealed that the mitochondrial M1 fractions of both cell lines were indeed contaminated with nuclear proteins such as the PCNA but, for unknown reasons, not with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Fig. 2B). Thus, the observed p53 signals in the M1 fractions of irradiated cells might only reflect contaminations with nuclear p53. To avoid such nuclear contaminations, and to undoubtedly establish whether IR induces the mitochondrial translocation of p53, we further purified the mitochondria-enriched M1 fractions by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. Western blot analyses of samples obtained with such a purification procedure (M2 fractions) now clearly revealed an irradiation-induced translocation of p53 to the mitochondria in both MCF-7 lines (Fig. 2B). Only the mitochondrial marker proteins Tom20 and cytochrome c (data not shown), but not the nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase or PCNA proteins were detected together with p53 in the M2 fraction of irradiated cells, confirming the composition and purity of these samples. In addition, these data suggest that the mitochondrial p53 translocation must have occurred in vivo as a response of the cell to IR exposure, but not because of an in vitro co-sedimentation artifact caused by the preparation procedure. It was reported previously that a fraction of p53 only localizes to mitochondria under conditions that provoke p53-dependent apoptosis, but not in apoptosis-resistant cells (28Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 30Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). However, we now show that IR induces also the mitochondrial translocation of p53 in MCF-7 and MCF-7/casp-3 cells that are highly resistant to apoptosis induced by IR. In an attempt to explain this discrepancy, we prepared sucrose gradient fractions from MCF-7/casp-3 cells that were exposed to IR in combination with the methylxanthine and ATM inhibitor caffeine, a treatment that efficiently induces apoptosis in these cells (35Essmann F. Engels I.H. Totzke G. Schulze-Osthoff K. Jänicke R.U. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7065-7072Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). When compared with purified M2 fractions of cells that were only irradiated, co-treatment with caffeine resulted in even further increased p53 levels at the mitochondria (Fig. 2C). At first glance, this result would therefore support the idea that mitochondrial translocation of p53 correlates with apoptosis induction. Howev"

Statistical analysis revealed a cluster of genes that were strongly down-regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 and which not only function in cell cycle regulation and DNA replication but also mediate checkpoint control, DNA repair, chromosome modifications, and mitosis. Because many of these genes were shown earlier to be regulated by the transcriptional repressor E2F4, the intergenic regions of these 1,25(OH)2D3-down-regulated genes were searched for the presence of E2F binding sites. This led to the characterization of two novel E2F target genes, chromosome condensation-related SMC-associated protein 1 (Cnap1) and maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (Melk). Transfection studies and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed Cnap1 and Melk to be bona fide E2F targets.

This down-regulation as well as the antiproliferative effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 depended on the pocket proteins p107 and p130 because 1,25(OH)2D3 failed to repress these E2F target genes and lost its antiproliferative action in p107–/–;p130–/– cells but not in pRb–/– cells. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) has potent antiproliferative effects characterized by a hampered G1/S transition. cDNA microarrays were used to monitor expression of 21,492 genes in MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h after treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3.

The phosphorylation status of these pocket proteins determines their association with members of the E2F family of transcriptional regulators, which play a pivotal role in mediating gene expression during cell proliferation. These E2F proteins can be allocated to four subclasses. Upon release by their pocket protein pRb, E2Fs 1–3 function as transcriptional activators in late G1 and in S phase. E2F4 and E2F5 act as transcriptional repressors in quiescent and early G1 cells by associating with p107 or p130 (1Classon M. Dyson N. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Cam H. Dynlacht B.D. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells repression of the promoter activity of E2F target genes is associated with the recruitment of E2F4 and p130 and low levels of histone acetylation. By late G1, these proteins are largely replaced by activator E2Fs in concert with histone acetylation and gene activation. It is, therefore, likely that two pathways, one controlled by pRb and the other by p130/p107, regulate distinct downstream events required for G1 progression and G1/S transition (2Cam H.

Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Selznick S.H. Dominguez C.E. Jurutka P.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanism behind this growth-inhibitory effect is unknown. 1,25(OH)2D3 has a cell cycle-specific effect leading to an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (9Wang Q.M. Luo X. Studzinski G.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2851-2855PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that 1,25(OH)2D3 reduces the activity of the cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 complex, which may contribute to its antiproliferative effect (10Jensen S.S. Madsen M.W. Lukas J. Binderup L. Bartek J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the present study a cDNA microarray was performed to examine the expression profile of 21,492 genes in MC3T3-E1 cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 for different times up to 36 h. Statistical analysis revealed a cluster of down-regulated genes involved in cell cycle regulation and in DNA replication but also in checkpoint control, DNA repair, chromosome transactions, and mitosis. Approximately 30% of the genes in this cluster are known E2F targets, and in silico promoter analysis demonstrated an additional 20% of the genes to contain E2F binding sites in their promoter. Four of these genes were selected for further analysis, namely Cnap1, Melk, retroviral integration site 2 (Ris2), and enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2). Expression of these genes was growth-regulated as were the promoter activities of Cnap1 and Melk. Mutational analysis revealed that the identified E2F binding sites were required for transactivation by E2F family members. Rather than being key genes responsible for the antiproliferative effect of 1,25(OH)2D3, these genes are suggested to be part of the general mechanism by which the pocket proteins translate the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 and regulate a large number of E2F target genes. Because p107–/–;p130–/–-cells no longer responded to the antiproliferative activity of 1,25(OH)2D3, we suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 exerts this growth-inhibitory effect by means of the repressive activity of p107/p130·E2F complexes rather than by affecting pRb-related E2F activity, as previously suggested. Cell Culture—MC3T3-E1 cells (Riken Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) and GR cells were cultured as previously described (11Eelen G. Verlinden L. Van Camp M. Van Hummelen P. Marchal K. De Moor B. Mathieu C. Carmeliet G. Bouillon R. Verstuyf A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 133-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type, pRb, p107, and p130 nullizygous as well as p107 p130 double nullizygous murine embryonic fibroblasts (wt, pRb–/–, p107–/–, p130–/–, and p107–/–;p130–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 mg/ml glucose with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutaMAX-I, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Proliferation Assays—Antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 were measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation or by analysis of cell cycle distribution as previously described (11Eelen G. Verlinden L.

Van Camp M. Marcelis S. Sabbe K. Zhao X.Y. De Clercq P. Vandewalle M. Bouillon R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2673-2679PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA Extraction—Total RNA for microarray analysis was extracted with TRizol LS reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA for quantitative RT-PCR analysis was isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Construction of Microarrays—The mouse gene set consisted of 5 separate microarrays containing in total 21,492 cDNA fragments. The clone set was composed from the 8000 collection of Incyte (Mouse Gem I, Incyte, Wilmington, DE) and from the 15,000 collection of National Institute of Aging (HGMP Resource Centre, Cambridge, UK). A complete description of the array content and the printing procedures can be downloaded from ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) with accession number A-MECP-146. RNA Labeling and Hybridization—Antisense RNA amplification, RNA labeling, and hybridization were performed as previously described (11Eelen G. Verlinden L. Van Camp M. Van Hummelen P. Marchal K. De Moor B. Mathieu C. Carmeliet G. Bouillon R. Verstuyf A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 133-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All protocols can be downloaded from www.microarrays.be or via ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) with accession number P-MEXP578-582. Scanning and Microarray Data Analysis—Array slides were scanned using a Generation III scanner (Amersham Biosciences) with wavelength settings at 532 nm (Cy3 signal) and 635 nm (Cy5 signal). Image analysis was performed with ArrayVision (Imaging Research Inc., St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada). Spot intensities were measured as artifact-removed total intensities (ARVol). Spot intensities were normalized using a Loess-fit (13Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar) for removing nonlinear dye related variation followed by a global analysis of variance normalization (14Engelen K. Coessens B. Marchal K. De Moor B. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 893-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The obtained expression data were clustered with the AQBC algorithm (15De Smet F. Mathys J. Marchal K. Thijs G. De Moor B. Moreau Y. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the intergenic regions of all the genes in the resulting clusters were selected using the Ensembl mart data base release 18.1 (16Kasprzyk A. Keefe D. Smedley D. London D. Spooner W. Melsopp C. Hammond M. Rocca-Serra P. Cox T. Birney E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The intergenic region is defined as the region upstream of the transcription start, limited to 2 kilobases, and the 5′-untranslated region, limited to the first intron. These intergenic regions (both direct and indirect strands) were then screened with a position-specific weight matrix of E2F, downloaded from the jaspar data base (jaspar.cgb.ki.se) (17Lenhard B. Wasserman W.W. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1135-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18Sandelin A. Alkema W. Engstrom P. Wasserman W.W. Lenhard B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D91-D94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The screening was performed using the MotifScanner algorithm with prior set to 0.2 and a mouse-specific zero-order background model (19Thijs G. Moreau Y. De Smet F. Mathys J. Lescot M. Rombauts S. Rouze P. De Moor B. Marchal K. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 331-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Plasmids—A TK-TATA luciferase reporter vector served as a control vector for the same reporter construct in which six artificial E2F binding sites were cloned (20Hofman K. Swinnen J.V. Verhoeven G. Heyns W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The pGL3-Basic reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as control for pGL3-Basic vectors in which both short and long fragments of the intergenic regions of mouse Melk and Cnap1 were cloned. Site-directed mutagenesis of the E2F binding sites in these promoter regions was performed by use of the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The sequences of the primers used are available upon request. Expression plasmids pcDNA-HA-E2F1, -E2F2, -E2F3, and -E2F4 were kind gifts of Dr. J. Nevins (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). The cytomegalovirus-hemagglutinin-E2F5 expression plasmid was a kind gift of Dr. J Magae (Institute of Research and Innovation, Chiba, Japan). The β-galactosidase expression vector pcDNA3.1(-)/Myc-His/lacZ and the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector were obtained from Invitrogen. Transfection Assays—Exponentially growing MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) in 24-well dishes (2 × 105 cells/well) with 100 ng of luciferase reporter vector (or representative control vector), 50 ng of the different E2F constructs (or the empty pcDNA3.1/Myc-His), and 10 ng of pcDNA3.1(–)/Myc-His/lacZ. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection (with reporter lysis buffer, Roche Diagnostics), and luciferase activity was measured with the luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity, measured with the Galacto-Light Plus System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To measure growth-dependent induction of the Cnap1 and Melk promoter activities, growth-arrested MC3T3-E1 cells (48 h in α-minimal essential medium with 0.1% fetal bovine serum) were transfected with 100 ng of luciferase reporter vector (or control vector) and 10 ng of pcDNA3.1(-)/Myc-His/lacZ. The next day cells were released into the cell cycle by the addition of α-minimal essential medium with 15% fetal bovine serum. The effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment on the promoter activities of Cnap1 and Melk was determined by transfection of MC3T3-E1 cells and wt or p107–/–;p130–/– MEFs with 100 ng of luciferase reporter vector (or control vector) and 10 ng of pcDNA3.1(–)/Myc-His/lacZ. The day after transfection MC3T3-E1 cells were stimulated with 10–8 m 1,25(OH)2D3, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assessed after a 24-h incubation period with 1,25(OH)2D3. wt and p107–/–;p130–/– MEFs were stimulated for 48 h with 10–7 m 1,25(OH)2D3. Quantitative Real-time PCR—cDNA production, PCR reactions, and subsequent quantification was performed as described previously (21Overbergh L. Valckx D. Waer M. Mathieu C. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). PCR primers and fluorogenic probes (6-carboxyfluorescein as reporter and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine as quencher dye) for mouse Ezh2, Ris2, Cnap1, Melk, VDR, CYP24, and β-actin were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Sequences of primers and probes are available upon request. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Reactions—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were based on a previously described protocol (22Vaisanen S. Dunlop T.W. Frank C. Carlberg C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 89–90: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, 106 MC3T3-E1 cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde (1%) for 10 min. After lysis of the cells, samples were sonicated with a Branson Sonifer 250 to generate DNA fragments with an average length of 500 bp. Subsequently, samples were incubated overnight with 10 μg of anti-E2F1-antibody (sc-193x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or irrelevant antibody (“mock”, rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins, Dako, Denmark) at 4 °C with rotation. After collection and elution of immunocomplexes, cross-links were reversed, and DNA was recovered with a QIAquick spin kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 30 μl. 4 μl of recovered DNA was used for PCR analysis. PCR products were analyzed by standard gel electrophoresis. The sequences of the primers used are available upon request. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed with the software program NCSS (NCSS, Kaysville, UT). All results are expressed as the means and S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Analysis of variance analyses were followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison test or a Student's t test. p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. Genes Down-regulated after Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 Cluster into Distinct Functional Groups—Analysis of microarray data led to the identification of a cluster of 94 different genes, which were similarly down-regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 (TABLE ONE). Down-regulation started at 12–24 h after treatment, and the degree of down-regulation at 36 h ranged from 1.5- to 4.3-fold. 1,25(OH)2D3 not only decreased the expression of genes that are involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA replication but also that of genes that mediate checkpoint control, DNA repair, chromosome transactions, and mitosis.TABLE ONEIdentification of genes downregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment and their expression profileNameAccession no.Gene expression in MC3T3-E1 cells treated with 10-8 m 1,25(OH)2D3 relative to gene expression in vehicle-treated cellsFunction1 h6 h12 h24 h36 hCell Cycle Regulation Ccna2BG0696881.061.091.080.520.43Cyclin-dependent protein kinase regulator activity Ccna2BG0735181.000.860.780.490.43 Ccnb1AA3963241.071.150.990.520.39Cyclin-dependent protein kinase regulator activity (G2/M) Ccnb1BG0784261.011.071.130.540.40 Cdc20BG0786381.011.180.890.540.38Cell division cycle protein;

Therefore, the remaining genes in this cluster were screened for E2F binding sites in their promoter. An additional 20% of the genes was found to contain E2F binding sites. Four of these genes were selected for further study based on the highly conserved E2F binding sites in their promoter (Cnap1, Ezh2, and Ris2), on the one hand, and on their overexpression in undifferentiated cancers, on the other hand (Cnap1, Ezh2, and Melk) (23Rhodes D.R.

Expression Analysis of Cnap1, Melk, Ris2, and Ezh2 in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated Cells—Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) experiments were performed in MC3T3-E1 cells to monitor the expression profile of these genes at different time points up to 72 h after treatment with a single dose of 1,25(OH)2D3 (10–10 m) (Fig. 1). The expression of all 4 genes decreased as soon as 6 h after treatment. A maximal 5-fold reduction was observed at 48–72 h after treatment. Growth-dependent Expression of Cnap1, Melk, Ris2, and Ezh2—To determine whether the expression of Cnap1, Melk, Ris2, and Ezh2 was growth-regulated, MC3T3-E1 cells were serum-starved for 48 h and subsequently stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by the addition of serum (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2B, mRNA transcripts of all four genes strongly increased after the addition of serum and peaked at the G1/S transition (16–20 h after re-feeding, Fig. 2A), which suggested that the regulation of these genes was growth-dependent.

The CTD is composed of a tandemly repeated heptapeptide of consensus sequence 1YSPTSPS7. CTD positions Ser5 and Ser2 undergo waves of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation during the transcription cycle. The potential complexity of the CTD serine phosphorylation array comprises 4n different structures, where n is the number of heptad repeats (n varies from 15 in microsporidia to 52 in mammals). Thus, the CTD is a vast repository of information about the state of the transcriptional apparatus (a so-called “CTD code” (1Buratowski S. Nature Struct.

Studies of the interaction of mRNA capping enzymes with the phosphorylated CTD have illuminated its atomic structure and how CTD length, amino acid sequence, and the phosphorylation array influence CTD-PO4 effector functions (2Ho C.K.

A subject of intense interest (and debate) is whether and how CTD kinases and phosphatases are themselves responsive to specificity determinants within the CTD. Among the CTD phosphatases, some enzymes fail to discriminate between Ser2-PO4 and Ser5-PO4 substrates (9Hausmann S. Schwer B. Shuman S.

Ssu72 belongs to the CXXXXXR superfamily of metal-independent phosphohydrolases that act via a cysteinyl phosphoenzyme intermediate (15Krishnamurthy S. He X. Reyes-Reyes M. Moore C. Hampsey M. Mol.

This situation, whereby nature has selected two entirely different structural solutions to perform the same site-specific chemical transformation of the CTD, provides an opportunity to address key questions about how the CTD code is read. Here we demonstrate that CPL1/2 and Ssu72 rely on different positional cues in the CTD primary structure to recognize and hydrolyze Ser5-PO4. Recombinant Proteins—The CPL1-(1-646) and CPL2-(1-649) coding sequences were amplified by PCR using primers designed to introduce BglII sites at the start codon and immediately 3′ of the stop codon. The BglII-digested PCR products were inserted into pET28-His10Smt3 that had been linearized with BamHI. The resulting expression plasmids pET-His10Smt3-CPL1-(1-646) and pET-His10Smt3-CPL2-(1-649) encode the respective CPL proteins fused in-frame to an amino-terminal His10Smt3 domain consisting of a His10 leader (MGHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIEGRH) followed by the 98-amino acid Saccharomyces cerevisiae Smt3 protein and a single serine. (Smt3 is the yeast ortholog of the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO.) pET-His10Smt3 plasmids encoding mutated versions CPL1-(1-646)-D161A and CPL2-(1-649)-D144A were generated by two-stage overlap extension PCR and cloning of the BglII-digested mutated PCR products into pET28-His10Smt3. The pET-His10Smt3-CPL plasmids were transformed into Escherichia-coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3). Cultures (500 ml) derived from single transformants were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A600 reached 0.6. The cultures were adjusted to 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% ethanol, and incubation was continued for 20 h at 17 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysozyme were added to final concentrations of 500 μm and 100 μg/ml, respectively. After incubation on ice for 30 min, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extracts were mixed for 30 min with 1 ml of Ni2+- nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The resin was recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A, and poured into columns. The columns were washed with 10 ml of 20 mm imidazole in buffer A and then eluted stepwise with 1.5 ml of buffer A containing 50, 100, 250, and 500 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant His10Smt3-CPL polypeptides were recovered predominantly in the 250 mm imidazole fractions. The 250 mm imidazole eluates were dialyzed against buffer A containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 0.01% Triton X-100 and then stored at -80 °C. The CPL1 and CPL2 concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of serial dilutions of the CPL preparations in parallel with serial dilutions of a BSA standard. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the staining intensities of the His10Smt3-CPL and BSA polypeptides were quantified using a Fujifilm FLA-5000 digital imaging and analysis system. CPL1 and CPL2 concentrations were calculated by interpolation to the BSA standard curve. Wild-type Ssu72 and the C15S mutant were produced in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase fusions and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described (15Krishnamurthy S. He X. Reyes-Reyes M. Moore C. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad dye reagent using BSA as the standard. Velocity Sedimentation—Aliquots (40 μg) of the nickel-agarose preparations of CPL1 and CPL2 were mixed with catalase (45 μg), BSA (45 μg), and cytochrome c (45 μg), and the mixtures were applied to 4.8-ml 15-30% glycerol gradients containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100. The gradients were centrifuged in a SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 17 h at 4 °C. Fractions (∼0.26 ml) were collected from the bottoms of the tubes. CTD Phosphopeptides—CTD Ser-PO4 peptides were synthesized and purified by the Sloan-Kettering Microchemistry Core Laboratory as described previously (2Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 8Hausmann S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10892-10900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The peptides were dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA and stored at 4 °C. The molar concentrations of the phosphopeptides were initially estimated from the absorbance at 274 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.4 × 103 m-1 for tyrosine. The content of Ser-PO4 was then determined for each peptide, measuring the release of inorganic phosphate after digestion with calf intestinal phosphatase as described (8Hausmann S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10892-10900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CTD Phosphatase Assay—Reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 5.5), 10 mm MgCl2, CTD phosphopeptide, and CPL1 or CPL2 were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 5 mm dithiothreitol, CTD phosphopeptide, and Ssu72 as specified were incubated for 120 min at 30 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 0.5 ml of malachite green reagent (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Release of phosphate was determined by measuring A620 and interpolating the value to a phosphate standard curve. The amounts of CTD substrate in the CTD phosphatase reactions are expressed as input phosphoserine, as determined by CIP digestion performed in parallel with each assay. Physical and Biochemical Characterization of CPL1 and CPL2—CPL1 and CPL2 were shown previously to dephosphorylate in vitro Ser5 of the Arabidopsis CTD (consisting of 34 heptad repeats), but not Ser2 (13Koiwa H. Hausmann S. Bang W.Y. Ueda A. Kondo N. Hiraguri A. Fukuhara T. Bahk J.D. Yun D.J. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14539-14544Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Exclusive hydrolysis of Ser5-PO4, but not Ser2-PO4, was also demonstrated using defined synthetic CTD phosphopeptides. Physical and biochemical characterization of the plant phosphatases was hampered initially by the poor solubility of the recombinant proteinsinE. coli and their susceptibility to proteolysis invivo. Deletion analysis showed that the carboxyl-terminal segments of CPL1 and CPL2 could be removed without diminishing phosphatase activity or affecting the Ser5 specficity (13Koiwa H. Hausmann S.

Here, we produced the catalytically active amino-terminal domains as His10Smt3-CPL fusions; this maneuver improved their yield and solubility compared with previous expression strategies. The His10Smt3-tagged proteins CPL1-(1-646) and CPL2-(1-649) were isolated from soluble bacterial extracts by adsorption to nickel-agarose and elution with imidazole. SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of polypeptides corresponding to the intact fusion proteins (Fig. 1A, arrows). The apparent sizes of the Smt3-CPL fusion proteins by SDS-PAGE (97-98 kDa) were larger than their calculated molecular masses of 87 kDa; this is because the Smt3 domain migrates aberrantly during SDS-PAGE, appearing ∼10 kDa larger than its predicted size. The CPL1 and CPL2 preparation contained several polypeptides in the 60-90-kDa range and a cluster of smaller polypeptides migrating at 20-27 kDa (the latter correspond to His10Smt3- and His10Smt3-peptide fusions arising via proteolysis) (Fig. 1A and data not shown). The quaternary structure of recombinant CPL1 and CPL2 was investigated by zonal velocity sedimentation through a 15-30% glycerol gradient (Fig. 1, B and C). Marker protein catalases (native size 248 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa) were included as internal standards in the gradient. The tagged CPL1 and CPL2 proteins sedimented as discrete peaks coincident with BSA. CPL1 and CPL2 were clearly separated from the cluster of low molecular weight polypeptides, which cosedimented with cytochrome c. The CTD Ser5 phosphatase activity profile (measured by the release of Pi from a synthetic phosphopeptide) paralleled the abundance of the intact CPL1 and CPL2 polypeptides. These results are consistent with a monomeric quaternary structure for the catalytic domains of CPL1 and CPL2. CPL1- and CPL2-catalyzed release of Pi from a 28-amino acid tetraheptad CTD Ser5-PO4 substrate was proportional to enzyme concentration (expressed as the amount of full-length CPL fusion protein); 95% of the input Ser5-PO4 residues were hydrolyzed at saturating CPL levels (Fig. 2A). From the slope of the titration curves we estimated that CPL1 and CPL2 hydrolyzed a 6400- and 9300-fold molar excess of Ser5-PO4/enzyme, respectively, during the 60-min reaction. Neither CPL1 nor CPL2 catalyzed Pi release from a tetraheptad CTD Ser2-PO4 substrate (Fig. 2A). A kinetic analysis is shown in Fig. 2B of the reaction of CPL2 with the tetraheptad CTD-Ser5-PO4 substrate at two different levels of input enzyme. Product accumulated steadily with a pseudo-first order profile. The initial rate was proportional to enzyme concentration; the turnover number was 13 s-1. Reaction of CPL1 and CPL2 with a 14-amino acid diheptad CTD Ser5-PO4 substrate YSPTSPSYSPTSPS resulted in Pi release proportional to the amount of input enzyme (Fig. 2C). 85% of the input phosphoserine was hydrolyzed at saturating enzyme levels (Fig. 2C and data not shown). CPL1 and CPL2 released an ∼11,000-fold molar excess of Pi/enzyme during the 60-min reaction. In contrast, CPL1 and CPL2 were inert in hydrolyzing a diheptad CTD Ser2-PO4 substrate YSPTSPSYSPTSPS (Fig. 2C). This experiment showed that two heptad repeats suffice for Ser5-specific CTD phosphatase activity. CPL1 and CPL2 are putative members of the DXDXT phosphotransferase family. The signature feature of these enzymes is the formation of an intermediate in which phosphate is attached covalently to the first Asp residue of the DXDXT motif (23Lahiri S. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Science. 2003; 299: 2067-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We mutated the presumptive Asp nucleophiles of CPL1 (Asp161) and CPL2 (Asp144) to alanine, produced the His10Smt3-CPL1-(1-646)-D161A and His10Smt3-CPL2-(1-649)-D144A proteins in bacteria, and isolated them from soluble extracts by affinity chromatography. The polypeptide compositions of the mutant proteins were virtually identical to those of the wild-type CPL1 and CPL2 (not shown). The CPL1-D161A and CPL2-D144A preparations displayed no detectable CTD-Ser5 phosphatase activity at levels of input protein that were saturating for the respective wild-type enzymes (not shown). These results suggest that the plant CPLs are bona fide acyl-phosphatases and, in conjunction with the sedimentation data, prove that the observed CTD-Ser5-specific CTD phosphatase activity is intrinsic to the recombinant CPLs. CTD Ser5 Phosphatase Activity of Ssu72—The specificity of Ssu72 was characterized using a recombinant glutathione S-transferase-Ssu72 fusion protein purified from a soluble bacterial lysate by glutathione-affinity chromatography (Fig. 3D). Ssu72 hydrolyzed Pi from the tetraheptad Ser5-PO4 substrate; activity reached a plateau at 2.5-5 μg of input protein (Fig. 3A), at which point 55% of the input Ser5-PO4 residues had been hydrolyzed. Product accumulated steadily during a 3-h reaction (Fig. 3B), which signified that the low end point was not dictated by inactivation of the enzyme during the incubation. Additional experiments showed that, although adding more Ssu72 to the reaction after the end point had been achieved did not result in further Pi release, adding more peptide without more enzyme did result in hydrolysis of ∼50% of the additional substrate (not shown). Ssu72 failed to release Pi from the tetraheptad Ser2-PO4 substrate (Fig. 3, A and B). Ssu72 also hydrolyzed the diheptad CTD Ser5-PO4 substrate YSPTSPSYSPTSPS. 50% of the input phosphoserine was hydrolyzed at saturating enzyme levels (Fig. 3C). We estimated Ssu72 hydrolyzed a 150-fold molar excess of Ser5-PO4/enzyme during the 120-min reaction, which corresponds to a turnover number of 1.2 min-1. Ssu72 was unreactive with the diheptad CTD Ser2-PO4 substrate YSPTSPSYSPTSPS (Fig. 3C). Ssu72 resembles the low molecular weight cysteinyl phosphatase enzymes. The presumptive catalytic mechanism entails attack of a cysteine thiolate nucleophile on the substrate to form a cysteinyl-phosphoenzyme intermediate. Here we found that the purified recombinant active site mutant Ssu72-C15S (Fig. 3D) was incapable of hydrolyzing the CTD-Ser5-PO4 peptide substrate (not shown). CPLs and Ssu72 Recognize Different Specificity Determinants in the CTD—To probe the role of CTD primary structure in Ser5 phosphatase activity, we tested mutated versions of the tetraheptad CTD Ser5-PO4 peptide (YSPTSPS)4, wherein every Tyr1, Ser2, Pro3, Thr4, or Pro6 was replaced by alanine. The titration profiles of the reaction of CPL1 with the S2A, T4A and P6A substrates were similar to that of the wild-type CTD (Fig. 4A). However, the CPL1 activity profiles with the P3A and Y1A substrates displayed a shift to the right (Fig. 4A). The specific activities of CPL1 with the P3A and Y1A substrates were 16 and 4%, respectively, of the activity with the wild-type (YSPTSPS)4 substrate. CPL2 hydrolyzed the S2A and T4A CTDs as well as the wild-type CTD. Activity was reduced modestly by the P6A change (to 27% of wild-type) and drastically by the P3A (3%) and Y1A (1%) CTD mutations (Fig. 4B). These experiments demonstrate that Tyr1 and Pro3 are the critical determinants of CPL phosphatase activity at position Ser5. Ssu72 responded quite differently to changes in CTD primary structure (Fig. 4C). The P3A change that was deleterious to the CPLs had virtually no ill effect on Ssu72, whereas the T4A mutation, which was well tolerated by the CPLs, was inimical to Ssu72, reducing its specific activity to 3% of the wild-type CTD level (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the P6A lesion abolished Ser5 phosphatase activity of Ssu72, though it had no effect on CPL1 and only a modest effect on CPL2. Ssu72 activity was reduced severely (to 4% of wild-type) by the Y1A change and was unaffected by S2A. We conclude that: (i) Tyr1, Thr4, and Pro6 are the critical determinants of Ssu72 phosphatase, and (ii) different CTD phosphatases with the same exquisite specificity for Ser5-PO4 achieve their specificities by recognizing different structural cues in the CTD. By titrating the wild-type (YSPTSPS)4 substrate against fixed amounts of CPL1, CPL2, and Ssu72, we determined apparent Km values of 60, 140, and 280 μm, respectively (not shown). These values are higher than the substrate concentrations (∼30 μm) used in the specific activity determinations in Fig. 4. Thus, we retested the activity of CPL1 and CPL2 with the wild-type, Y1A, P3A, and P6A tetraheptad Ser5-PO4 peptides at substrate concentrations (240-260 μm) in excess of the Km for wild-type peptide (Fig. 5). The hierarchy of mutational effects at higher substrate was similar to what was observed at limiting substrate. The extents of phosphate release by CPL1 with the P6A, P3A, and Y1A substrates were 96, 27, and 13%, respectively, of the activity with the wild-type (YSPTSPS)4 substrate (Fig. 5, left panel). Phosphate release by CPL2 with the P6A, P3A, and Y1A substrates was 64, 7, and 4% of activity with the wild-type peptide (middle panel). Thus, raising the CTD concentration above Km only slightly mitigated the effects of the Y1A or P3A changes on CPL1 activity, or the effects of Y1A, P3A, and P6A on CPL2 function, vis-à-vis their activity with the wild-type tetraheptad substrate. A parallel experiment with Ssu72 at the higher substrate concentrations showed that phosphate release with the Y1A, T4A, and P6A substrates was 8, 12, and 3% of its activity with the wild-type peptide (Fig. 5, right panel). Effects of a Lysine Substitution at Position 7 of the CTD Heptad—The identity of the amino acid at position 7 of the CTD is either highly conserved (e.g. all serines in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe CTD (GenBank™ accession code CAB57941) and Encephalitozoon cuniculi CTD (GenBank™ CAD26175)) or subject to variation from one heptad to another within the same CTD. In the case of human RNA polymerase II (GenBank™ P24928), one-half (26/52) of the heptads have a consensus Ser7, and the others are substituted, most commonly with Lys7 (7 heptads) or Asn7 (5 heptads). The CTD of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (GenBank™ Z98551) is dominated by Lys7-containing heptads (11/15 repeats). To gauge the role, if any, of the position 7 side chain as a CTD phosphatase specificity determinant, we tested a tetraheptad CTD Ser5-PO4 peptide (YSPTSPK)4 in which every Ser7 was replaced by lysine. The titration profiles of the reaction of CPL1 and CPL2 with the S7K substrates were similar to that of the wild-type CTD (Fig. 6, A and B). Ssu72 was ∼30% as active with the S7K CTD substrate as it was with the wild-type CTD (Fig. 6C). Thus, neither the CPLs nor Ssu72 depend on Ser7 for their Ser5-specific phosphatase activity. Different Phasing of Specificity Determinants for CPLs and Ssu72— Further insight into the location of the specificity determinants emerged from an analysis of the reaction of CPLs and Ssu72 with diheptad monophosphorylated CTDs, which contained Ser5-PO4 in either the amino-terminal heptad (YSPTSPSYSPTSPS) or the carboxyl-terminal heptad (YSPTSPSYSPTSPS). Ssu72 displayed a 10-fold preference for hydrolysis of Ser5-PO4 within the amino-terminal heptad (Fig. 7C). This result implies that the recognition of Tyr1 by Ssu72 occurs on the carboxyl side of the Ser5-PO4 moiety that is being hydrolyzed, i.e. Ssu72 has higher activity on the proximal repeat because Ssu72 recognizes the Thr4 and Pro6 flanking the Ser5-PO4 and the Tyr1 in the distal repeat (see Fig. 9). Ssu72 is only weakly active on the distal repeat because there is no Tyr1 available on the carboxyl side of the phosphoserine. From a substrate titration experiment at a fixed level of Ssu72, we determined an apparent Km of 850 μm for the YSPTSPSYSPTSPS peptide (data not shown); thus, the affinity of the enzyme for a tetraheptad CTD with four phosphoserines is ∼3-fold higher than for a diheptad with a single phosphoserine.FIGURE 9CPLs and Ssu72 read distinct overlapping CTD codes to hydrolyze Ser5-PO4. The CTD structural determinants of CPL and Ssu72 phosphatase activity are indicated by arrows above and below the CTD primary structure. The phosphorylated Ser5 position is colored red. It is presumed that the specificity determinants are likely to residue on a common face of the CTD with which the phosphatase interacts. The CTD requirements for CPL activity are consistent with the β-like conformation of the corresponding CTD segment bound to CTD-docking site 2 (CDS2) of yeast mRNA capping enzyme, which is illustrated at top right. The requirements for Ssu72 activity suggest a β-like conformation of the same CTD segment bound to CDS1 of the capping enzyme, which is shown at bottom left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CPL1 and CPL2 display the opposite preference; they are 2- to 3-fold more active in hydrolyzing Ser5-PO4 when it is located in the carboxyl-terminal heptad (Fig. 7, A and B). These results suggests that: (i) the CPLs recognize the Tyr1 residue upstream of the phosphorylated Ser5 that is being hydrolyzed, and (ii) 2 amino acids downstream of Ser5-PO4 suffice. From substrate titration experiments, we determined apparent Km values of CPL1 and CPL2 for the preferred YSPTSPSYSPTSPS peptide of 100 and 570 μm, respectively (data not shown). The disfavored CPL substrate does contain a Tyr1 upstream of Ser5-PO4 in the first repeat; perhaps the free amine of the terminal Tyr1 (which adds a positive charge not present normally) might account for the lower activity of this substrate. Alternatively, 1 or more amino acids on the upstream side of Tyr1 might contribute to substrate recognition, either directly or by limiting the flexibility of the Tyr1 residue. To address these issues, we tested a series of incrementally truncated 12-mer (PTSPSYSPTSPS), 10-mer (SPSYSPTSPS), and 8-mer (SYSPTSPS) peptides containing a complete Ser5-PO4 heptad at their carboxyl termini and either 5, 3, or 1 amino acids from an upstream heptad (Fig. 8). CPL1 and CPL2 readily hydrolyzed the 12- and 10-mer substrates, whereas their activities with the 8-mer were reduced by factors of 2 and 3, respectively (Fig. 8). We surmise that CPL1/2 activity is optimal with as few as 3 amino acids on the amino-terminal side of Tyr1. Apparent Km values of CPL1 and CPL2 for the 12-mer PTSPSYSPTSPS were 180 and 950 μm, respectively (not shown). Properties of the CTD Code—Here we have begun to illuminate how the CTD code is read by two classes of protein phosphatases that specifically dephosphorylate Ser5. The instructive findings are that the plant CPLs and yeast Ssu72 recognize entirely different constellations of specificity determinants in the CTD. Whereas the CPLs rely on Tyr1 and Pro3 located on the upstream side of the Ser5-PO4 target site, Ssu72 recognizes Thr4 and Pro6 flanking the target Ser5-PO4 plus the downstream Tyr1 residues of the adjacent heptad (Fig. 9). The two classes of phosphatases not only see different amino acids, they see them in entirely different registers with respect to Ser5-PO4. The simple interpretation of our results is that: (i) the functionally relevant CTD structural elements comprise the respective binding sites for the CPLs and Ssu72, and (ii) those CTD elements are likely to be disposed on the surface of the CTD Ser5-PO4 substrate to which the phosphatase docks. The most plausible scenario is that the proper CTD conformation for catalysis is templated by interaction with the phosphatase via an induced fit mechanism, as shown for other CTD-binding proteins. Although we do not yet have an atomic structure of the CTD bound to either of the phosphatases studied here, we can make an educated guess as to what conformations the phosphatases might select for, based on principles emerging from the structure of the mRNA capping enzyme bound to the Ser5-PO4 CTD (4Fabrega C. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1549-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Interactions with the phosphorylated CTD occur at two distinct CTD-docking sites (CDS1 and CDS2) on the guanylyltransferase surface. CDS1 engages a CTD segment TSPSYSP, whereas CDS2 interacts with a downstream segment SYSPTSP located two heptads away. Thus, the capping enzyme samples two distinct CTD structures that are phased in different registers with respect to Ser5-PO4. The CTD bound at sites CDS1 and CDS2 adopts a β-like extended conformation, whereby every other residue is oriented toward or away from the protein surface (Fig. 9). It is remarkable that the CTD segments and the CTD conformations at CDS1 and CDS2 of the capping enzyme satisfy reasonably well the specificity parameters elucidated here for Ssu72 and the CPLs, respectively. To wit, the Tyr1, Pro3, and Ser-PO4 moieties that comprise the recognition code for CPL1/2 project onto a common surface within CDS2, whereas Ser2 and Thr4, which are not needed for CPL1/2 activity, project away from the docking site (Fig. 9). Pro6 also projects onto the protein side of the interface in CDS2; this residue is not critical for CPL1 phosphatase activity but does play a modest role in CPL2 function. We envision that the CTD adopts a CDS2-like conformation in its interaction with the CPL1 and CPL2 phosphatases. The Ser5-PO4, Pro6, and Tyr1 moieties that Ssu72 recognizes are located on the protein side of the interface in CDS1, whereas Ser2 and Pro3, to which Ssu72 is indifferent, project away from the protein surface (Fig. 9). We therefore speculate that the CTD adopts a CDS1-like conformation in its interaction with Ssu72. Although Thr4 does not contribute to the CTD-protein interface at CDS1 of the capping enzyme, the Thr Oγ is in position to donate a hydrogen bond to the vicinal phosphate group at Ser5 (4Fabrega C. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1549-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The finding of at least two CTD coding elements that signal specific hydrolysis of Ser5-PO4 has implications for understanding CTD information content. First, the functional “footprints” of CPL1/2 and Ssu72 on the CTD primary structure collectively span more than one heptad repeat, a state of affairs that is consistent with recent genetic evidence that the essential functional unit of the CTD is contained with a contiguous diheptad pair (26Stiller J.W. Cook M.S. Eukaryotic Cell. 2004; 3: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Second, there is no simple rule for what is recognized. The CTD phosphorylation sites are located within Ser-Pro dipeptides. With respect to CTD Ser5-specific dephosphorylation, Ssu72 is identified here as a stringently Pro6-directed phosphatase, whereas CPL1 is Pro6-independent and CPL2 is only modestly affected by elimination of Pro6. Third, even though the CTD is structurally plastic, there are likely to exist a set of CTD conformational states that are utilized reiteratively by different CTD-binding proteins, even where the proteins are themselves not structurally related (e.g. the CTD phosphatases and the mRNA capping enzyme). Fourth, the information content of the CTD can be amplified by blending multiple distinct CTD coding elements (such as those seen here for the CPLs and Ssu72) to form a bipartite, or even higher order, recognition site for CTD-associated factors (such as the capping enzyme)."
https://openalex.org/W2078581083,"The flagellar calcium-binding protein (FCaBP) of the flagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi associates with the flagellar membrane via its N-terminal myristate and palmitate moieties in a calcium-modulated, conformation-dependent manner.

FCaBP contains four EF-hand calcium-binding domains, the third and fourth (EF-3 and EF-4) of which bind calcium (2Maldonado R.A. Mirzoeva S. Godsel L.M. Lukas T.J. Goldenberg S. Watterson D.M. Engman D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 101: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The protein is modified at the N terminus by the addition of myristate and palmitate, both of which are required for association with the inner leaflet of the flagellar membrane (3Godsel L.M. Engman D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Calcium is required for stable flagellar localization as well, since FCaBP can be washed out of detergent-permeabilized trypanosomes if calcium chelators are included in the wash solutions. Because of the size, acylation, calcium binding, membrane association, and calcium-dependent localization of FCaBP, we concluded that the protein is a calcium acyl switch protein. These proteins undergo calcium-dependent membrane association by virtue of calcium-regulated extrusion or sequestration of a myristate moiety that mediates membrane binding (4Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar).The best studied calcium acyl switch protein is recoverin (Rv), a myristoylated calcium-binding protein of the mammalian retina (5Dizhoor A.M.

Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In the resting state of the cell, Rv binds two calcium ions and associates with the retinal outer segment (ROS) membrane through its exposed myristoyl group (5Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.K. Olshevskaya E.

A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). When localized at the ROS membrane, Rv then binds to rhodopsin kinase (RK) and inhibits it from acting upon its target protein, rhodopsin (5Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V.

Photoexcitation of the receptor cell results in an efflux of calcium. As the intracellular calcium level drops, Rv loses its calcium and adopts a conformation in which the myristic acid is sequestered within a hydrophobic cleft in the protein (10Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Unable to associate with the ROS membrane, Rv dissociates from RK, allowing RK to phosphorylate rhodopsin. Phosphorylation of rhodopsin leads to a rise in the level of intracellular calcium as the cell recovers from excitation. Rv binds calcium and adopts the open conformation and resumes the membrane-associated, RK-inhibiting position. This unique calcium-myristoyl switch mechanism allows calcium regulation of two proteins (RK and rhodopsin) that do not themselves bind calcium (4Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L.

FCaBP-like proteins are found not only in T. cruzi but also in the trypanosomes Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma lewisi, and Trypanosoma brucei. A flagellar calmodulin has also been characterized in T. brucei (11Ridgley E. Webster P. Patton C. Ruben L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These proteins all localize to the flagellum, a unique organelle that has many functions, including motility, chemotaxis, and cell signaling. In addition to the traditional “9 + 2” microtubule structure of the axoneme, there is a structure known as the paraflagellar rod that runs alongside the axoneme. The axoneme, paraflagellar rod, and flagelloplasm are encased by the flagellar membrane. It has been shown by freeze-fracture analysis that the flagellar membrane contains a higher concentration of sterols than does the pellicular (cell body) membrane (12Tetley L. Acta Trop. 1986; 43: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar), and current work in our laboratory demonstrates that the flagellum of T. brucei is highly enriched in lipid rafts. 3K. M. Tyler, A. Fridberg, C. L.

We wanted to investigate the role of calcium binding in the acyl switch mechanism by introducing point mutations in EF-3 and EF-4 to disrupt calcium binding and generated these FCaBP mutant proteins and T. cruzi epimastigotes expressing these proteins (i) to delineate the high and low affinity binding sites in FCaBP, (ii) to assess calcium-dependent conformational changes in these proteins, and (iii) to directly determine the role of calcium in the flagellar localization of FCaBP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESParasites—The Y strain of T. cruzi was used for all experiments, except for experiments involving the transfectants expressing FCaBP-Myc, which were previously generated in the Silvio X-10/4 clone (3Godsel L.M. Engman D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). T. cruzi epimastigotes were maintained at 26 °C in supplemented liver digest neutralized tryptose medium (15Kirchhoff L.V. Neva F.A. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1985; 254: 3058-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Engineering of FCaBP Point Mutants—Point mutations were introduced into the third and fourth EF hands of FCaBP by PCR amplification using an FCaBP cDNA as a template. For mutagenesis of the third EF hand, sense and antisense primers (GAGGAGCAGTTCAAGCG and TGAACTGCTCCTCGTCG, respectively) were used to substitute glutamate at position 151 with glutamine (E151Q). For mutagenesis of the fourth EF hand, sense and antisense primers (TCGACCAGTTTGCTGCG and ACACCTGATCGTAGCACAG, respectively) were used to substitute glutamate at position 188 with glutamine (E188Q). The E151Q,E188Q double mutant (DM) was generated using E188Q cDNA as a template for PCR with the sense and antisense primers used to generate the E151Q substitution. These primers also introduced 5′ EcoRI and 3′ XbaI restriction sites. Coding regions for the three mutant proteins were cloned into pBluescript S/K (Stratagene) using EcoRI and XbaI and subcloned directionally into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to add a C-terminal Myc (9E10) and hexahistidine epitope tag. These coding regions were further subcloned directionally into the T. cruzi episomal expression vector pTEX-9E10 (16Tibbetts R.S. Klein K.G. Engman D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using PmeI and SmaI. Mutant proteins in pBS/K served as a template to generate 5′- and 3′-ends. These cDNAs were subcloned directionally into the protein expression vector pET23b (Novagen). The bacterial recombinant proteins produced contain hexahistidine epitope tags.Transfection—T. cruzi epimastigotes were grown to a density of 1-2 × 107/ml at 26 °C in liver digest neutralized tryptose medium, washed twice with PBSG buffer (1000 mg/liter dl-glucose, 36 mg/liter sodium pyruvate; Invitrogen), and resuspended in electroporation buffer (0.5 mm MgOAc, 0.1 mm CaCl2 in PBS) at a density of 2.5 × 108 cells/ml. 400 μl of the cell suspension was placed into a 0.2-cm electrode gap cuvette with 10 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA and pulsed once at 0.450 kV and 500 microfarads using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad). Electroporated cells were placed in a 5-ml liver digest neutralized tryptose medium, and G418 (0.5 mg/ml) was added 48 h later. Drug-resistant lines developed and were available for study after ∼4-6 weeks.Protein Purification and Calcium Binding Analysis—Recombinant proteins were engineered to contain C-terminal hexahistidine tags by cloning in pET23b (Novagen) and were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene). After induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, transformants were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, pelleted, and lysed by heat shock and sonication. Lysates were cleared by two rounds of centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, and recombinant proteins were purified using a Ni2+-charged His·Bind chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). Eluted samples were dialyzed with a solution of 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and concentrated using Centricon Centriplus YM filters (Amicon), molecular mass cut-off 3,000 Da. 5 μg of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by 45Ca2+ overlay analysis (17Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar).Calcium Titration by Tryptophan Intrinsic Fluorescence Spectrometry—Experiments were performed as described in Ref. 14Pinto A.P. Campana P.T. Beltramini L.M. Silber A.M. Araujo A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1652: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. Steady-state measurements were performed in an ISS K2 spectrofluorimeter (ISS Fluorescence, Analytical, and Biomedical Instrumentation). The temperature of the solution was maintained at 18 °C using a circulating water bath (Fisher). Protein solutions were measured in a 1-cm rectangular quartz cuvette. For tryptophan fluorescence calcium titration experiments, the excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded from 305 to 450 nm. Fluorescence spectra of 2.7 mm protein solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 150 mm NaCl were titrated with increasing amounts of calcium to saturation. Intensity at each point was corrected for dilution. To eliminate background the spectra of buffers, containing or not containing calcium, were measured and subtracted from the samples measured spectra.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Calorimetry was performed using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.), essentially as described (18Osawa M. Dace A. Tong K.I. Valiveti A. Ikura M. Ames J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18008-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In each titration, 40 × 10-5-μl aliquots of 15 mm CaCl2 were added to 180 μm protein.NMR Spectrometry—Samples for NMR spectrometry were prepared by dissolving 15N-labeled FCaBP proteins (0.5 mm) in 0.5 ml of a 95% H2O, 5% 2H2O solution containing 10 mm 2H2 imidazole (pH 7.0), 1 mm 2H10 dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, and either 1 mm EDTA (Ca2+-free) or 2 mm CaCl2 (Ca2+-bound). All NMR experiments were performed at 35 °C on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer equipped with a four-channel interface and a triple resonance probe with triple axis pulsed field gradients. The 15N-1H HSQC spectra were recorded on samples of 15N-labeled FCaBP (in 95% H2O, 5% 2H2O). The two-dimensional spectra were processed and analyzed as described previously (19Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Localization of FCaBP Mutant Transproteins by Immunofluorescence Microscopy—T. cruzi transfectants expressing the various FCaBP mutant proteins were isolated by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and resuspended in PBS at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. 20 μl of this suspension was added to an amino-alkysilane-coated Silane-Prep slide (Sigma), and the cells were allowed to settle to the slide. The following solutions contained neither calcium nor calcium chelator. Cells were fixed by treatment with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min and incubated at -20 °C in anhydrous methanol overnight. For immunofluorescence microscopy, slides were incubated in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum in PBS) for 1 h, followed by incubation with either His-specific monoclonal antibody (Ab-1 OB05; Oncogene), c-Myc-specific 9E10 monoclonal antibody hybridoma supernatant (ATCC CRL1729, Myc 1-9E10.2), or FCaBP-specific mouse serum overnight at 4 °C. Parasites were washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (Caltag Laboratories). Slides were then mounted in Permafluor aqueous mounting medium (Immunotech) and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Microscopy was performed using an Leica DM IRE2 inverted system microscope, and images were captured using Open Lab 4.0.2 (Improvision).Immunoblot Analysis—Parasite protein lysates were boiled and analyzed by one-dimensional 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44709) Google Scholar) and incubated with FCaBP-specific (1Engman D.M. Krause K.-H. Blumin J.H. Kim K.S. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18627-18631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mouse serum, hsp70-specific mouse serum, or c-Myc-specific, 9E10 monoclonal antibody hybridoma supernatant overnight. Blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (Caltag Laboratories) and developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—T. cruzi transfectants expressing WT, E151Q, or DM mutant proteins were grown to midlog phase (5-7 × 106 cells/ml), and 2 × 108 cells of each line were suspended in 6 ml of liver digest neutralized tryptose medium containing 1 mCi of [9,10-3H]myristate (30-50 Ci/mmol) or Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 1 mCi of [9,10-3H]palmitate (30-60 Ci/mmol). Cultures were incubated at room temperature, shaking slowly for 4 h (myristate labeling) or 1 h (palmitate labeling) and then washed several times each with 20 ml of PBS to remove excess label. Cells were then lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 0.02% NaN3, EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation 14,000 × g for 10 min, divided into 250-μl aliquots, and stored at -20 °C until use. Aliquots of the labeled radioimmune precipitation lysates were precleared over protein G beads for 4 h at 4 °Cand then incubated with FCaBP-specific mouse serum cross-linked to protein G beads and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed several times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. [3H]Myristate-labeled precipitates were suspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 8 min. [3H]palmitate-labeled samples were suspended in nondenaturing sample buffer (2× Laemmli sample buffer without dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 2 min to avoid cleavage of the labile thioester bond. Samples were analyzed on one-dimensional, 12% Tris-HCl precast gels (Bio-Rad). Gels were examined by immunoblotting or staining with Coomassie Blue, destained with acetic acid and methanol, treated for fluorography (Amplify), dried, and exposed to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) film for both 72 h and 1 week.GST Pull-down Assays—Recombinant FCaBP was engineered to contain an N-terminal GST tag by cloning in pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) and was expressed in E. coli DH5α cells (Stratagene). After induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, transformants were incubated for 4 h at 37°C, pelleted and lysed with lysozyme, sonicated, and incubated with 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min; the recombinant protein was purified using a GST chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences); and eluted samples were dialyzed into PBS. Midlog T. cruzi epimastigotes were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES containing either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA and resuspended at 3.5 × 108 cells/ml. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 2800 × g for 7 min at 4 °C and divided into 500-μl aliquots and stored at -20 °C until use. Lysates were precleared using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and then incubated with 50 μg of GST-FCaBP or GST and rotated overnight at 4 °C. For experiments using the cross-linking agent dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (Pierce), dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) was dissolved in Me2SO and added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Samples were rotated for 2 h at 4°C; Tris HCl, pH 7.5, was added to a final concentration of 20 mm; and the samples were incubated on ice for 15 min. Bound proteins were collected by centrifugation and washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline. Precipitates were suspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 8 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by SYPRO Ruby staining (Bio-Rad).RESULTSDetermination of High and Low Affinity Calcium-binding Sites—FCaBP contains four canonical EF hand calcium-binding sequences, the third and fourth of which bind calcium (2Maldonado R.A. Mirzoeva S. Godsel L.M. Lukas T.J. Goldenberg S. Watterson D.M. Engman D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 101: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To assign the individual binding affinities to their respective binding sites, we introduced a single point mutation into each EF hand sequence to disrupt calcium binding while maintaining the overall structure of the domain. The glutamic acid residue at position 12 of the EF hand is critical for conjugating the calcium ion and substitution of this residue with glutamine dramatically lowers the affinity of calcium-binding at that site (21Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant proteins were generated using the following substitutions: E151Q (in EF-3), E188Q (in EF-4), and E151Q,E188Q (DM) (Fig. 1). The calcium dissociation constants of these proteins were determined by tryptophan fluorescence spectrometry. The change in the quantum yield of tryptophan fluorescence during the titration of calcium in recombinant wild type (WT) FCaBP and DM proteins is shown (Fig. 2A). Scatchard analysis of the curve of binding (not shown) revealed two binding sites, with association constants (Ka) 9.0 ± 0.9 and 122 ± 1.9 μm and no evidence of cooperativity. This curve also shows that the complete saturation of binding sites is reached at 350 μm calcium. These results are similar to calcium binding properties previously determined for another isoform of FCaBP, rC29, which binds with affinities of 3.3 ± 0.5 and 190 ± 0.2 μm (14Pinto A.P. Campana P.T. Beltramini L.M. Silber A.M. Araujo A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1652: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2FCaBP point mutants are deficient in calcium binding.

B, 5 μg of purified bacterial recombinant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by 45CaCl2 overlay using 45Ca2+. Filters were analyzed by autoradiography (left) and then stained with Ponceau (right) to visualize the protein. C, isothermal titration microcalorimetric analysis of calcium binding to wild type FCaBP, E188Q, and E151Q. Traces of the calorimetric titration are shown at the top, with corresponding integrated binding isotherms shown at the bottom (solid lines represent the best fit to a two-site model). For wild type FCaBP, K1 = 1 × 105 m-1, ΔH1 = -9.8 kcal/mol, K2 = 1 × 104 m-1, and ΔH2 = 1.1 kcal/mol. For E188q, K1 = 1 × 105 m-1, ΔH1 = -10 kcal/mol, K2 < 2 × 103 m-1, and ΔH2 = 2 kcal/mol. For E151Q, K1 < 9 × 103 m-1, ΔH1 = -4.8 kcal/mol, K2 = 1 × 104 m-1, and ΔH2 = 4.3 kcal/mol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assign the high and low affinity sites, recombinant FCaBP proteins were examined by 45Ca2+ overlay analysis (17Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The filters were stained with Ponceau stain to visualize the amount of protein in each lane. At low calcium concentration (3 μm CaCl2), calcium binding was significantly less in the E151Q and DM proteins compared with that of the WT protein. The E188Q protein showed an intermediate level of binding. Binding to all proteins increased with increasing concentration of 45CaCl2. It should be noted that the calcium overlay assay has high background at calcium concentrations exceeding 10 μm, and protein molecular weight standards also bound 45CaCl2 at this and higher concentrations (data not shown). Calcium binding of the proteins decreases in the order WT > E188Q > E151Q > DM, demonstrating that EF-3 is the high affinity site and EF-4 is the low affinity site. This conclusion was confirmed by performance of isothermal titration calorimetry on the mutant proteins (Fig. 2C). Titration of CaCl2 into wild type FCaBP resulted in a biphasic calorimetric calcium binding isotherm that could be fit by the binding of two or more calcium ions. The wild type isotherm exhibits an initial exothermic phase representing stoichiometric binding of one calcium to the protein (Kd ∼10 μm and ΔH = -9.8 kcal/mol), followed by an endothermic phase, representing lower affinity binding of one or more calcium ions (Kd ∼100 μm and ΔH = 1.1 kcal/mol). The E188Q isotherm also contains an initial exothermic phase that represents high affinity calcium binding to EF-3 (Kd ∼10 μm and ΔH = -10 kcal/mol) followed by an endothermic phase that represents very low affinity and nonspecific binding to EF-4 (Kd > 1 mm and ΔH = 2 kcal/mol). The E188Q mutation does not completely abolish calcium binding to EF-4 but rather lowers its binding affinity by more than 10-fold. The E151Q isotherm lacks the high affinity phase seen in wild type and E188Q (Kd ∼10 μm), indicating that EF-3 is the high affinity site. Again, the E151Q mutation does not completely abolish calcium binding to EF-3 but rather lowers its binding affinity by more than 10-fold.Effect of Calcium Binding on the Conformation of FCaBP—We previously discovered that FCaBP displays calcium-dependent flagellar membrane association, reminiscent of calcium-acyl switching (3Godsel L.M. Engman D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To directly test whether the switch mechanism involves a calcium-modulated change in protein conformation, we used NMR spectrometry to assess structural differences in the calcium-free and calcium-bound states of FCaBP and its calcium-binding mutants. Two-dimensional NMR spectra (1H-15N HSQC) of uniformly 15N-labeled calcium-free and calcium-bound forms of the various FCaBP proteins were determined (Fig. 3). Peaks in each spectrum represent main chain and side chain amide protons that serve as fingerprints of the overall conformation of the protein. The NMR spectra of calcium-free and calcium-bound WT FCaBP exhibit clear differences (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that FCaBP changes conformation in response to calcium binding. In particular, the spectrum of calcium-free WT FCaBP exhibits many strong and clearly resolved peaks, suggesting that the protein is monomeric and adopts a stable and well defined tertiary structure. In contrast, the spectrum of calcium-bound WT FCaBP exhibit"
https://openalex.org/W2070050301,"Recent genetic studies have associated members of the thrombospondin (TSP) gene family with premature cardiovascular disease. The disease-associated polymorphisms lead to single amino acid changes in TSP-4 (A387P) and TSP-1 (N700S). These substitutions reside in adjacent domains of these highly homologous proteins. Secondary structural predictive programs and the homology of the domains harboring these amino acid substitutions to those in other proteins pointed to potential alterations of putative Ca2+ binding sites that reside in close proximity to the polymorphic amino acids. Since Ca2+ binding is critical for the structure and function of TSP family members, direct evidence for differences in Ca2+ binding by the polymorphic forms was sought. Using synthetic peptides and purified recombinant variant fragments bearing the amino acid substitutions, we measured differences in Tb3+ luminescence as an index of Ca2+ binding. The Tb3+ binding constants placed the TSP-1 region affected by N700S polymorphism among other high-affinity Ca2+ binding sites. The affinity of Ca2+ binding was lower for peptides (3.5-fold) and recombinant fragments (10-fold) containing the S700 vs. the N700 form. In TSP-4, the P387 form acquired an additional Ca2+ binding site absent in the A387 form. The results of our study suggest that both substitutions (A387P in TSP-4 and N700S in TSP-1) alter Ca2+ binding properties. Since these substitutions exert the opposite effects on Ca2+ binding, a decrease in TSP-1 and an increase in TSP-4, the two TSP variants are likely to influence cardiovascular functions in distinct but yet pathogenic ways."
https://openalex.org/W2019950056,"Transcriptional signaling from the Ca2+-calmodulin-activated phosphatase calcineurin to its substrate NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells, also termed NFATc) is critically dependent on a protein-protein docking interaction between calcineurin and the PXIXIT motif in NFAT. Several inhibitors of NFAT-calcineurin association (INCA compounds) prevent binding of NFAT or the peptide ligand PVIVIT to calcineurin. Here we show that the binding site on calcineurin for INCA1, INCA2, and INCA6 is centered on cysteine 266 of calcineurin Aα and does not coincide with the core PXIXIT-binding site. Although ample evidence indicates that INCA1 and INCA2 react covalently with cysteine 266, covalent derivatization alone is not sufficient for maximal inhibition of the calcineurin-PVIVIT interaction, because the maleimide INCA12 reacts with the same site and produces only very modest inhibition. Thus, inhibition arises through an allosteric change affecting the PXIXIT docking site, which may be assisted by covalent binding but depends on other specific features of the ligand. The spatial arrangement of the binding sites for PVIVIT and INCA makes it probable that the change in conformation involves the β11-β12 loop of calcineurin. The finding that an allosteric site controls NFAT binding opens new alternatives for inhibition of calcineurin-NFAT signaling.

Each strategy has the potential to be more selective and, hence, less toxic than treatment with CsA or FK506, but none has yet advanced to the stage of small nonpeptide inhibitors that can be tested in vivo. There is considerable evidence that targeting the calcineurin-NFAT protein-protein interaction will produce a selective inhibition. We have demonstrated that the calcineurin-NFAT interaction is based on recognition of a PXIXIT motif in NFAT and that this recognition is essential for efficient signaling (23Aramburu J.

Med. 2004; 10: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) shows that a competitor peptide modified to promote its uptake into cells can prevent heterologous graft rejection in mice. Further, high throughput screening of a library of organic compounds has led to identification of nonpeptide inhibitors of NFAT-calcineurin association (INCA compounds) (25Roehrl M.H.A. Kang S. Aramburu J. Wagner G. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7554-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These compounds interfere with calcineurin-NFAT signaling in cells, motivating a continued search for inhibitors that have higher affinity and reduced nonspecific toxicity and that are suitable for in vivo administration to animals. The further development of inhibitors can be guided by structural information about the sites of protein-protein interaction and inhibitor binding. To this end, we have determined the structure of the NFAT docking site on calcineurin, in which the PXIXIT recognition peptide of NFAT binds in an extended configuration and each conserved residue of the peptide directly contacts calcineurin (33Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1659-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here we extend the structural studies by identifying a distinct binding site for INCA compounds at a cysteine residue adjacent to the PXIXIT peptide docking site. It is covalent binding or tight noncovalent binding of the bulky INCA compounds at this second site that allosterically inhibits recognition of PXIXIT peptide and NFAT. Our findings serve to identify the approaches that are most likely to be fruitful in developing improved inhibitors. In addition, the findings suggest that calcineurin-substrate recognition, like calcineurin catalytic activity (34Wang X. Culotta V.C. Klee C.B.

Yaffe M.B. López-Rodríguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding mutant proteins with individual Cys → Ala or Cys → Val replacements or with the combined Cys → Ala/Cys-266 (all surface Cys residues changed to Ala except for Cys-266) and Cys → Ala/C266V (all surface Cys residues changed to Ala except at position 266, where Cys is changed to Val) replacements were made by PCR mutagenesis with appropriate primers and subcloning. In each case, the sequence of the cDNA insert was verified. GST-calcineurin fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21-CodonPlus-RP (Stratagene) by overnight growth at 18 °C after the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Calcineurin was purified from the bacterial lysate by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and cleavage in 50 mm Tris ·HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Purified calcineurin-(2-347) was concentrated by Centricon-30 filtration, aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. In most cases, the concentration of DTT in the buffer was reduced to 0.1 mm during concentration of the protein. This step and the further substantial dilution into fluorescence polarization assays minimized any interference of residual DTT with the INCA compounds. In some cases, protein was concentrated in buffer free of DTT immediately before freezing. The PVIVIT 14-mer peptide (24Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. López-Rodríguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) was labeled overnight at room temperature in a reaction containing 2 mg of peptide, 1.5 mg of Oregon Green (Oregon Green 488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (5-isomer); Invitrogen), and 5 μl of diisopropylethylamine in 190 μl of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide. The labeled peptide was purified by C18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The calcineurin-(254-273)/C256S peptide, RGSSYFYSYPAVCEFLQHNN, was synthesized and HPLC-purified at Tufts University Core Facility and stored desiccated at -20 °C. Inhibitors—INCA1, INCA2, INCA6, and INCA12 (Fig. 1) were obtained from ChemBridge. Inhibitor stocks were prepared at 10 mm in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored desiccated at -20 °C. Corresponding aliquots of anhydrous Me2SO were stored desiccated at -20 °C for addition to control incubations. Me2SO at concentrations up to 1% had no effect on the parameters studied. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were made on 10-μl samples in a black 384-well plate (Molecular Devices) using the fluorescein filter set (excitation at 485 nm, emission at 530 nm) in an Analyst plate reader (Molecular Devices). Each well contained 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% (w/v) bovine IgG, calcineurin, 100 nm fluorescent PVIVIT, and other additions as specified. Calcineurin was omitted for measurements of the fluorescence emitted by unbound peptide. In competitive binding assays, calcineurin was typically present at 1 or 1.5 μm; in direct binding titrations, calcineurin was used at 0.15-10 μm. Except in time course experiments, adequate time was allowed for the signal to reach a stable value as verified by repeated readings of the same samples. Pretreatment with iodoacetamide (IAM), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), or INCA12 was for 30 min to 2 h. Data from direct titrations with calcineurin have been fitted to a model for equilibrium binding to a single class of sites (38Nardone J. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Competition and time course data for INCA compounds have been plotted without attempting to fit a theoretical curve, because the data are not sufficient to specify parameters for covalent binding, noncovalent binding, and side reactions of the INCA compounds. The stability of calcineurin-INCA2 association was examined after equilibration of 6 μm calcineurin, 100 nm labeled PVIVIT, and 20 μm INCA2 to produce an essentially complete blockade of PVIVIT binding. To assess short-term stability of the complex, samples were extracted by vortex mixing with 2 volumes of buffer-saturated ether for 2 min and briefly centrifuged to separate the phases. Extraction of samples containing only calcineurin and labeled PVIVIT had no effect on peptide binding and did not prevent subsequent displacement of peptide by INCA2. Extraction of samples containing only the INCA compound prior to incubation with calcineurin and PVIVIT demonstrated that removal of unbound INCA2 from the aqueous phase was complete within 10 s. To assess long-term stability of the complex, samples containing PVIVIT and blocked calcineurin were supplemented with 5 mm NEM or 5 mm DTT, and PVIVIT binding was monitored during the following 4 h. Because the calcineurin concentration in fluorescence polarization assays is greater than the Kd of the calcineurin-PVIVIT interaction, each of these procedures is a sensitive test for the unmasking of blocked PVIVIT-binding sites. Synthetic Peptide-INCA Reactions—Freshly dissolved RGSSYFYSYPAVCEFLQHNN peptide, 6 μm in 200 mm NaCl, 4 mm Mg acetate, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.35, in 20 μl total volume, was incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 50 μm INCA1, INCA2, or INCA6. At the end of this incubation, samples were either immediately diluted into 240 μl 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and frozen or further incubated for 60 min after the addition of NEM to 1 mm then diluted into 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and frozen. Control samples were reacted first with 1 mm NEM for 60 min and then with 50 μm INCA compound for 60 min. Mass Spectrometry—For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, samples were desalted and concentrated by binding the peptides to C18 resin in a ZipTip (Millipore) and eluting with 70% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Eluted peptides were diluted 1:10 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (10 mg/ml in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) and dried onto the target plate. Mass spectra were obtained using an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR instrument operated in reflector mode with accelerating voltage of 20 kV, grid voltage at 72%, guide wire at 0.1%, and extraction delay time of 175 ns. Calibration was performed using the MSCAL2 mass standard set (Sigma). A minor peak frequently observed in the peptide sample having a mass of ∼1776 Da is apparently the peptide fragment RGSSYFYSYPAVCEF. Corresponding peaks in samples that had been incubated with INCA1, INCA2, or NEM or in samples subjected to prolonged incubation with INCA6 to allow the reaction to approach completion were shifted by the same mass as the main peak in those incubations. A peak of mass ∼1397 Da, matching the calculated mass of the fragment RGSSYFYSYPAV, was present occasionally both in untreated peptide samples and in samples that had been incubated with NEM or INCA compounds. The reaction or lack of reaction observed with these peptide fragments reinforces the conclusion that all of the compounds investigated reacted with the cysteine -SH group. Cellular Assays—Dephosphorylation of NFAT, nuclear import of NFAT, and induction of cytokine mRNAs in D5 T cells were assessed as described in previous publications (23Aramburu J. García-Cozár F.

Bierer B.E. Methods. 1996; 9: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with phosphorylated RII peptide as substrate. D5 T cells were chilled on ice, collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris ·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and, where specified, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate. After 5 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes containing an equal volume of 50 mm Tris ·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.5 μm okadaic acid. Blank samples were prepared with resuspension buffer in place of cell lysate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 32P-labeled RII peptide, each tube was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Each sample was applied to a Dowex AG 50W-X8 cation exchange column (Bio-Rad), and the effluent was collected and its content of radiolabel determined by liquid scintillation counting.

Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The coordinates of docked PVIVIT peptide were from Li et al. (33Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1659-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fig. 9 was prepared using RasMol. The compounds INCA1, INCA2, INCA6, and INCA12 (Fig. 1) have been shown to inhibit recognition of NFAT by calcineurin as assessed quantitatively by the binding of the fluorescent PVIVIT peptide to calcineurin. Several observations have raised the possibility that a covalent INCA-protein complex is involved in the inhibition of PVIVIT peptide binding. First, the most effective inhibitors were quinones or quinoneimines, compounds that are chemically reactive and that are known to form protein adducts. Second, the kinetics of binding were slow at intermediate concentrations of an INCA compound, as illustrated for INCA1 (Fig. 2A), with a plateau level of inhibition reached only after tens of minutes at room temperature. This behavior is often indicative of the formation of a covalent ligand-protein complex. Finally, INCA1, INCA2, and INCA6 were inactivated as inhibitors in the competitive binding assay by preincubation with DTT (Fig. 2B and not shown). Inactivation could reflect either reduction of the compounds by DTT to a less reactive form or covalent reaction with DTT. Effect of Sulfhydryl-modifying Reagents—Protein sulfhydryl groups are likely sites of covalent modification by quinones. Consistent with this possibility, preincubation of calcineurin with the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent IAM impaired INCA2 competition, whereas preincubation of calcineurin by itself had no effect (Fig. 3A). In more extensive studies, preincubation of calcineurin with the maleimide INCA12 impaired competition by INCA1, INCA2, and INCA6 (Fig. 3B and not shown). Pretreatment of calcineurin with the sulfhydryl-modifying reagents IAM, NEM, and INCA12 reduced the calcineurin-PVIVIT polarization signal even in the absence of an INCA competitor (Fig. 3 and not shown). Very low concentrations of INCA12 were sufficient to reduce the calcineurin-PVIVIT polarization signal, but even high concentrations did not fully eliminate the signal from bound PVIVIT (Fig. 4A). Similarly, for high concentrations of IAM and NEM, the calcineurin-PVIVIT signal settled to a plateau that was well above the signal of free peptide (not shown). The explanation for this behavior, documented below, is that pretreated calcineurin retains the ability to bind PVIVIT with reduced affinity. In principle, the effect of the nonspecific alkylating reagents IAM and NEM could be due either to true impairment of calcineurin-peptide binding or to impaired immobilization of the fluorescent label when the PVIVIT peptide is bound. The second case would be evident in a reduction in the maximal polarization signal obtained by titrating fluorescent PVIVIT with IAM-pretreated or NEM-pretreated calcineurin and a corresponding reduction in the slope of the central portion of the binding curve. In fact, the curves for pretreated calcineurin showed no change in slope but instead were shifted rightward to an extent compatible with a 1.5-2-fold loss in affinity of the calcineurin-peptide interaction (Fig. 4B). Thus IAM and NEM are themselves partial inhibitors of the calcineurin-PVIVIT interaction, and experiments described below indicate that they act at the same site as the INCA compounds. Identification of a Target Cysteine Residue—The inhibitory activity common to IAM, maleimides, and quinones/quinoneimines strongly supported the notion that these compounds derivatize a cysteine sulfhydryl of calcineurin. Pilot experiments examining the effect of several single Cys → Ala substitutions in calcineurin on the inhibitory activity of INCA2 pointed to Cys-266 as the likely reactive residue, and a more detailed study confirmed that the point mutant C266A was insensitive to the inhibitory effect of INCA2 (Fig. 5). Similar experiments demonstrated that this substitution also compromised the effectiveness of INCA1, INCA6, IAM, and maleimides (not shown). Conversely, the other surface-exposed cysteine sulfhydryl groups were not required for the action of INCA compounds. The crystal structure of calcineurin shows six exposed cysteine residues in the catalytic domain, Cys-166, Cys-184, Cys-228, Cys-256, Cys-266, and Cys-336. We compared calcineurin in which all exposed cysteine side chains except Cys-266 were changed to alanine (Cys → Ala/Cys-266) to calcineurin with the same substitutions plus a C266V substitution (Cys → Ala/C266V). Binding of fluorescent PVIVIT to the two proteins was comparable (Fig. 6A). However, whereas replacement of the cysteines other than Cys-266 did not compromise the effectiveness of INCA1, INCA2, or INCA6, the C266V substitution in the context of these other Cys → Ala replacements completely blocked the effects of the inhibitors (Fig. 6B and not shown). The C266V substitution in this context also blocked the effect of NEM (not shown). These observations showed that the presence of Cys-266 is necessary and sufficient for a complete block of PVIVIT binding by INCA compounds. Formation of a Peptide-INCA Adduct—We tested the ability of the three INCA compounds to react with the synthetic calcineurin peptide RGSSYFYSYPAVCEFLQHNN. The peptide is calcineurin-(254-273) with a C256S substitution to eliminate the possibility of a covalent reaction at that position. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry demonstrated that INCA1 and INCA2, at micromolar concentrations, react covalently with the synthetic calcineurin peptide (Fig. 7, A-C). Peptide-INCA adduct formation was blocked in each case by prior incubation with excess NEM under conditions that derivatized the -SH group (Fig. 7A and not shown). Conversely, NEM failed to react with the peptide-INCA adducts present after a first incubation with INCA1 and INCA2 (Fig. 7, B and C), confirming that the INCA compounds block the sulfhydryl group. Because the peptide is unlikely to have a preferred conformation in solution, the experiments show that INCA1 and INCA2 are sufficiently reactive to modify accessible cysteine sulfhydryl groups without necessarily forming an initial noncovalent complex. INCA6 reacted more slowly (Fig. 7D), with full labeling of the peptide requiring several hours. Reaction was again blocked by pretreatment with excess NEM. The sluggish reaction suggests that covalent reaction with Cys-266 in calcineurin would require higher concentrations of INCA6, a local environment that increases the nucleophilicity of the Cys-266 thiol or a noncovalent interaction that assists in targeting INCA6 to the site. Direct examination of tryptic digests of INCA6-treated calcineurin did not provide evidence of an INCA-protein adduct. Rather, the same tryptic peptide containing Cys-266, identified by comparison with digests of C266V calcineurin, was detected in the digests of untreated and treated calcineurin. However, it has been difficult to demonstrate adducts in tryptic digests of other proteins that are known to be covalently modified by quinones, probably because the sulfu"
https://openalex.org/W1994413205,"Oxytetracycline (OTC) is a 19-carbon polyketide antibiotic made by Streptomyces rimosus. The otcC gene encodes an anhydrotetracycline oxygenase that catalyzes a hydroxylation of the anthracycline structure at position C-6 after biosynthesis of the polyketide backbone is completed. A recombinant strain of S. rimosus that was disrupted in the genomic copy of otcC synthesized a novel C-17 polyketide. This result indicates that the absence of the otcC gene product significantly influences the ability of the OTC “minimal” polyketide synthase to make a polyketide product of the correct chain length. A mutant copy of otcC was made by site-directed mutagenesis of three essential glycine codons located within the putative NADPH-binding domain. The mutant gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and biochemical analysis confirmed that the gene product was catalytically inactive. When the mutant gene replaced the ablated gene in the chromosome of S. rimosus, the ability to make a 19-carbon backbone was restored, indicating that OtcC is an essential partner in the quaternary structure of the synthase complex."

The specification of neuronal identity is a result of interactions between the following two distinct classes of determinants: extrinsic factors, which include secreted or cell membrane-associated signals in the local environment, and intrinsic factors that generally consist of epistatic cascades of transcription factor. The correct interplay of both sets is absolutely required in order to establish the proper identity of individual neurons, and the relative contribution of each may vary at different developmental stages and according to the specific neuronal subtype.In general, intrinsic factors eventually cause cells to become independent of extrinsic signals and autonomously control the differentiation processes by directing the genetic program. This progression from extrinsic to intrinsic signals is well known in the development of the nervous system, but it is still poorly characterized at the molecular level (1Edlund T. Jessell T.M.

Rohrer H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 3Brunet J.F. Pattyn A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In particular, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP 3The abbreviations used are: BMPbone morphogenic proteinsEMSAelectromobility gel shift assayChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationCCHScongenital central hypoventilation syndromeUTRuntranslated regionDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolehhumanCCHScongenital central hypoventilation syndrome 3The abbreviations used are: BMPbone morphogenic proteinsEMSAelectromobility gel shift assayChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationCCHScongenital central hypoventilation syndromeUTRuntranslated regionDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolehhumanCCHScongenital central hypoventilation syndrome-2, -4, and -7) have been identified as essential extrinsic signals that are necessary to trigger the sympathetic neuronal differentiation of mammalian and avian neural crest cells (5Rohrer H. Drug News Perspect. 2003; 16: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). They are members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily of growth factors expressed in bone, brain, skin, and kidney, in which they regulate cell growth, differentiation, and embryogenesis (6Chen D. Zhao M. Harris S.E. Mi Z. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7ten Dijke P. Fu J. Schaap P. Roelen B.A. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am., Suppl. 3. 2003; 85: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the differentiation of sympathetic neurons, they control the expression of a set of transcription factors (Mash1, PHOX2A, PHOX2B, and dHand) representing a network of control genes that have hierarchically distinct roles but also partially overlapping functions (2Goridis C. Rohrer H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 3Brunet J.F. Pattyn A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Mash1 and PHOX2B are thought to be two independent intrinsic factors whose expression is absolutely required for the formation of sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia (8Stanke M. Stubbusch J. Rohrer H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which do not develop in mouse embryos lacking one of the two genes (9Guillemot F. Lo L.C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 10Pattyn A. Morin X. Cremer H. Goridis C. Brunet J.F. Nature. 1999; 399: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The actions of these transcription factors converge on PHOX2A and dHand in order to regulate their expression. Although many of the phenomenological and functional aspects of the transcriptional cascade that takes place in the developing ganglia have been clarified, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying such processes. We have demonstrated previously that PHOX2B regulates the transcription of the PHOX2A gene by directly binding and transactivating its promoter (11Flora A. Schulz R. Benfante R. Battaglioli E. Terzano S. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized the human PHOX2B promoter and demonstrated by means of biochemical and functional criteria that most of its transcriptional activity is sustained and maintained by an auto-regulatory mechanism in which PHOX2B binds and transactivates its own promoter, thus providing a possible molecular explanation for the progression from extrinsic to intrinsic signals in the developing ganglia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Cultures—The IMR32 human neuroblastoma cell line and the DAOY medulloblastoma cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. The HeLa cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine.RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analyses—The RNAs were prepared, and the Northern blot analysis was performed as described by Flora et al. (12Flora A. Lucchetti H. Benfante R. Goridis C. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7037-7045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNAs were hybridized with the human cDNA probes for PHOX2A and PHOX2B. The human PHOX2A probe was obtained by digesting the SacI-NcoI construct (11Flora A. Schulz R. Benfante R. Battaglioli E. Terzano S. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with EagI and NcoI and corresponds to the 5′-UTR region (nucleotides +26/+219).The PHOX2B probe was obtained by means of PCR amplification of human genomic DNA using primers designed on the region specifying the 5′-UTR of the mRNA (nucleotides –299/–90 with respect to the ATG; GenBank™ accession number NM_003924). The upper primer was 5′-GTGCCAGCCCAATAGACGGATG-3′ (nucleotides –195/–174 in Fig. 1B), and the lower primer was 5′-CTCAACGCCTGCCTCCAAACTG-3′ (nucleotides –7/+15 in Fig. 1B).Molecular Cloning of the Human PHOX2B 5′-Flanking Region—The human PHOX2B probe described above was used to screen a commercial human genomic library (Clontech) from normal peripheral blood leukocytes, cloned in the λ vector EMBL3 SP6/T7. After three rounds of screening, we isolated four different clones, one of which was analyzed in detail by means of restriction and Southern blotting analyses. The phage contained a 4.5-kb fragment mainly belonging to the PHOX2B 5′-regulatory sequence, as confirmed by partial sequencing. The 4.5-kb fragment was subcloned in the XhoI and SpeI sites of pBluescript II KS(+).Primer Extension—Total RNA from SY5Y, IMR32 cells, and HeLa cells was used to perform primer extension experiments using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-ATCCCAGCCATACAGGACTCGTAG-3′) complementary to the +142/+165 human PHOX2B sequence (underlined in Fig. 1B). The experiment was carried out as described in Flora et al. (11Flora A. Schulz R. Benfante R. Battaglioli E. Terzano S. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Construction of the Human PHOX2B Promoter Reporter Plasmids—The 4.5-kb XhoI-SpeI plasmid was used as a template to amplify the 5′-UTR of PHOX2B with the aim of mutagenizing the nucleotides surrounding the translation start codon in order to generate an NcoI site. This allowed the direct fusion of the PHOX2B 5′-UTR and the Renilla luciferase coding sequence. The 181-bp XbaI-NcoI PCR product and the 745-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment were cloned by means of three-way ligation into the HindIII and NcoI sites of phRG-b (Promega), thus generating the HindIII/NcoI construct containing the –825/+105 region (Fig. 1, A and B; with positive numbering starting from the major transcription start site). The construct was completely sequenced on both strands. In order to introduce point mutations into the ATTA sites (boxed in Fig. 1B), we exploited the recombinant PCR technique (11Flora A. Schulz R. Benfante R. Battaglioli E. Terzano S. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar), using the HindIII/NcoI construct as a template. All of the ATTA sites were mutagenized by substituting the two thymines with guanines.In order to generate the HindIII/NcoI [mut2] construct, fragment –825/–305 was amplified with the primers RV3 (5′-CAAAACAAACTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC-3′), corresponding to a vector sequence upstream of the polylinker, and ATTA2mut-LOW (5′-TCCCTGCCCTTTCCTTCAATCACACTA-3′), bearing two point mutations in the ATTA2 site (shown in boldface), and fragment –331/+105 was amplified with the primers ATTA2mut-UP (5′-TAGTGTGATTGAAGGAAAGGGCAGGG-3′) and GL2LOW (5′-GGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAG-3′), corresponding to a vector sequence downstream of the polylinker. The two PCR products were then mixed, denaturated, re-annealed, and subjected to 10 extension cycles in order to obtain the whole fragment containing the –825/+105 PHOX2B region, bearing two point mutations in the ATTA2 site. The whole fragment was further amplified by using the oligonucleotides RV3 and GL2LOW as primers. Finally, the PCR product was digested with HindIII and NcoI and subcloned into the corresponding restriction site of phRG-b.The same strategy was adopted to generate the HindIII/NcoI [mut3], HindIII/NcoI [mut4], and HindIII/NcoI [mut5] constructs using the following mutagenizing primers: ATTA3mut-LOW (5′-CTAATTAGAATTTCCTACCACACCATT-3′) and ATTA3mut-UP (5′-AATGGTGTGGTAGGAAATTCTAATTAG-3′) to generate HindIII/NcoI [mut3]; ATTA4mut-LOW (5′-TTCCTGCATCTCTCCTTAGAATTTAAT-3′) and ATTA4mut-UP (5′-ATTAAATTCTAAGGAGAGATGCAGGAA-3′) to generate HindIII/NcoI [mut4]; and ATTA5mut-LOW (5′-TATAGTCCTCATCCTAAACTTGGCTCT-3′) and ATTA5mut-UP (5′-AGAGCCAAGTTTAGGATGAGGACTATA-3′) to generate HindIII/NcoI [mut5].In order to obtain HindIII/NcoI [mut2,3,4,5], we first generated HindIII/NcoI [mut2,3], using HindIII/NcoI [mut2] as a template and introducing point mutations in the ATTA3 site as described above. HindIII/NcoI [mut2,3] was then used as a template to produce the HindIII/NcoI [mut2,3,5] construct, and finally, HindIII/NcoI [mut2,3,5] was used as a template to generate HindIII/NcoI [mut2,3,4,5].All of the constructs were completely sequenced on both strands in order to verify the introduction of the point mutations and rule out the accidental generation of unwanted mutations in the PHOX2B regulatory region or the Renilla luciferase reporter gene. The PHOX2B effector plasmid (PHOX2B/pcDNA3) used in the immunofluorescence and cotransfection experiments has been described by Flora et al. (11Flora A. Schulz R. Benfante R. Battaglioli E. Terzano S. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The human cDNA encoding PHOX2A was obtained in our laboratory 4D. Fornasari, unpublished results. and subcloned in pcDNA3.Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—The cells were transiently transfected by means of lipofection using 8 × 104 IMR32 or 4 × 104 HeLa cells. The experiments were carried out as described by Flora et al. (11Flora A. Schulz R. Benfante R. Battaglioli E. Terzano S. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The RSV-luc plasmid expresses the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and was co-transfected in each sample in order to normalize transfection efficiency. In the co-transfection experiments with PHOX2B, 150 fmol of the PHOX2B expression construct was added to the reporter and pRSV-luc plasmid and incubated with 2 μl of FuGENE 6. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were detected using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the supplier's instructions. All of the transfections were performed in duplicate, and each construct was tested in at least three independent experiments using different plasmid preparations batches. All of the plasmids were purified using Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) columns. The transient transfections data were analyzed as described previously (14Battaglioli E. Gotti C. Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Synthetic Peptide Preparation and Antibody Production—Two peptides corresponding to the sequences of human PHOX2A (CKPGPALKTNLF) and PHOX2B (CGAKAALVKSSMF), both of which are located in the carboxyl terminus of the proteins, were synthesized by means of a solid-phase method in an automated Applied Biosystem model 433A peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (15Fields C.G. Lloyd D.H. Macdonald R.L. Otteson K.M. Noble R.L. Pept. Res. 1991; 4: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were cleaved from the resin and side chain deprotected by reagent K, a scavenger-containing solution of trifluoroacetic acid (16King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar).The immunogens were produced by conjugating the peptides with mariculture keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) by using the heterobifunctional reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane 1-carboxylate (Pierce) according to the procedure proposed by Liu et al. (17Liu F.T. Zinnecker M. Hamaoka T. Katz D.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies from chicken egg yolk were produced by Davids Biotechnologie (Ragensburg, Germany).Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—The nuclear extracts were obtained as described by Terzano et al. (18Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41495-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).In Vitro Protein Expression—The in vitro expression of PHOX2A and PHOX2B was obtained by means of a commercial rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TnT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System, Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, PHOX2B/pcDNA3 or PHOX2A/pcDNA3 constructs were linearized with XhoI and in vitro transcribed by the T7 RNA polymerase. The purified plasmid was added together with methionine (1 mm final concentration) in the reaction tube provided by the manufacturer, which contained all of the reagents needed for transcription and translation in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 90 min. The negative controls were unprogrammed lysates in which the reactions were carried out without plasmids. [35S]Methionine was sometimes added to the reaction in order to be able to detect the protein product by autoradiography and confirm the correctness of its size.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The EMSAs were performed as described by Terzano et al. (18Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41495-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and Flora et al. (11Flora A. Schulz R. Benfante R. Battaglioli E. Terzano S. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J.

Unprogrammed lysates were also used as negative controls.The oligonucleotides used in the EMSA experiments are indicated. EMSAs (1Edlund T. Jessell T.M.

Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and corresponds to the PHOX2A promoter region that contains the DNA element for PHOX2B.Western Blotting—Fifteen micrograms of nuclear extract or 2 μlof in vitro expressed proteins were separated by means of 11% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were preincubated for 1 h with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), after which the primary antibodies were added at a appropriate dilution and incubated for 2 h, before the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Davids Biotechnologie, Ragensburg, Germany) was added and incubated for 1 h. After appropriate washes, the bands were revealed using Super Signal West Dura (Pierce). Standard molecular weights (New England Biolabs) were loaded in parallel, and the relative masses of the proteins of interest were calculated. Competition experiments were carried out using PHOX2A or PHOX2B peptides in a 10:1 mass ratio with the corresponding antibodies.Immunofluorescence—DAOY cells plated on 1.7 × 1.7-cm2 glass coverslips were grown to 50% confluency, transfected with pcDNA3/PHOX2A or pcDNA3/PHOX2B, or mock-transfected with the empty vector. After 24 h, they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.120 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37 °C. The monolayers were permeabilized and processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (19De Silvestris M. D'Arrigo A. Borgese N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The primary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:400 and revealed by means of an anti-chicken Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Competition assays were performed by incubating the related primary antibody with the specific peptide in a mass ratio of 10:1. Before mounting, the cells were stained with DAPI. The preparations were observed through a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped for epifluorescence, and the images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiocam HRm.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out following the protocols of Ballas et al. (20Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G.

The cells were harvested and washed in PBS, and the pellets were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 8, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The isolated nuclei were resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated to obtain DNA fragments with a length between 200 and 1000 bp. Sonicated chromatin was precleared with monoclonal anti-chicken IgY-agarose beads (Davids Biotechnologie, Ragensburg, Germany), 0.01 μg/μl chicken pre-immune IgY (Davids Biotechnologie, Ragensburg, Germany), 20 μg/μl tRNA, and 10 μg/μl salmon sperm DNA at 4 °C for 1 h.The precleared chromatin was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of each antibody (anti-hPHOX2A and anti-hPHOX2B antibodies (Davids Biotechnologie, Ragensburg, Germany); anti-Sp1 and anti-ac.H4 (Upstate); and chicken pre-immune IgY (Davids Biotechnologie, Ragensburg, Germany)), and the immunocomplexes were collected on monoclonal anti-chicken IgY-agarose beads pre-adsorbed with 20 μg/μl tRNA and 10 μg/μl salmon sperm DNA. Following washes and elution, cross-linking was reversed by heating to 65 °C overnight, and the samples were purified on columns (High Pure PCR product purification kit, Roche Applied Science).For the PCR detection of immunoprecipitated chromatin, 5% of the purified DNA was used as a template with the following primers: ChIP[2bprom]UP, 5′-CAAGCTTATTTCCAAGTAGTGTGATTGAAT-3′, and ChIP[2bprom]LOW, 5′-GCCTCCTATGAGATGCCTTGTCTGA-3, to amplify the PHOX2B promoter; ChIP[2bCDS]UP, 5′-TAGAGATGCAGGAATCAATGATAGGG-3′, and ChIP[2bCDS]LOW, (5′-GATATGGAGAAGGTGGCTGGAGTG-3′, to amplify the PHOX2B coding sequence; ChIP[PRS]UP, 5′-TATCCTTCACTGGTCAGCCTGGAG-3′, and ChIP[PRS]LOW, 5′-CAGCACGGGTAATCACATTTGTC-3′, to amplify the DBH promoter; ChIP[2aprom]UP, 5′-TCTTGTCCCTGTCTCCATCACTG-3, and ChIP[2aprom]LOW, 5′-AGTCCCTATCCTGCCCCAATC-3′, to amplify the PHOX2A promoter; ChIP[α5prom]UP, 5′-CTCTGCTCCAGGGTCGCAC-3′, and ChIP[α5prom]LOW, 5′-GAGTGTGAGTCGTGAGACAAAACG-3′, to amplify the α5 promoter.The DNA samples were heated to 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 47 cycles of heating to 95 °C for 30 s, and combined annealing/extension at 55 °C for 45 s.RESULTSStructural and Functional Characterization of the Human PHOX2B 5′-Regulatory Region—In order to isolate the 5′-flanking region of the PHOX2B gene, we screened a human genomic library with a probe corresponding to the DNA region specifying the 5′-UTR of PHOX2B mRNA. We identified four different clones, one of which (containing 930 bp immediately upstream of the translation start codon) was further characterized (Fig. 1, A and B).Primer extension experiments were performed to determine the initiation of transcription of the PHOX2B gene. A major transcription start site was identified in both neuronal cell lines (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3), and as expected, no signal was detectable in HeLa cells and yeast RNAs (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 4). Upstream of this site, computer-assisted analysis revealed the presence of a TATA-box consensus sequence in the canonical position of –34 bp (Fig. 1B, in boldface), which is in line with the hypothesis that the region corresponded to the PHOX2B promoter. Two minor transcription start sites were also detected in the SY5Y cells at positions –112 and –202 (Fig. 1C, lane 3), whose origin and significance remain to be investigated.In order to establish whether the examined genomic PHOX2B region contained relevant regulatory elements capable of driving transcription on the basis of functional criteria, we generated the HindIII/NcoI construct for transfection purposes. To this end, we used Northern blotting to evaluate the expression of PHOX2B mRNA in human neuroblastoma cell lines and found that SY5Y and IMR32 cells expressed appreciable amount of the transcript (Fig. 1D, lower panel, lanes 1 and 2). Most surprisingly, no PHOX2B mRNA was detectable in SK-N-BE or SK-N-BE (2)C cells (Fig. 1D, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). All four neuroblastoma cell lines expressed the PHOX2A transcript (Fig. 1D, upper panel, lanes 1–4), and as expected, the HeLa cells did not show any hybridization signal (Fig. 1D, upper and lower panels, lane 5).On the basis of these results, the HindIII/NcoI construct was transfected into IMR32 and HeLa cells, and its transcriptional activity was evaluated by means of luciferase assays and compared with that of the promoterless phRG-b plasmid, which contained the Renilla luciferase reporter gene but no upstream regulatory region. The HindIII/NcoI construct showed as much as 8.5 times the activity of phRG-b in IMR32 cells, whereas the activity of the two plasmids was similar in HeLa cells (Fig. 1E). These data thus suggested that the –825/+105 PHOX2B region was transcriptionally competent, with an activity profile restricted to neuronal cells.Characterization of a Polyclonal Antibody Directed against hPHOX2B—In order to follow the expression of hPHOX2B protein, we produced an anti-peptide polyclonal antibody in chicken eggs and verified its specificity by means of various criteria and techniques. We first made a Western blot analysis using nuclear extracts prepared from IMR32 or HeLa cells in parallel with the mouse Phox2b protein obtained by means of in vitro transcription/translation. It is worth noting that the two Phox2b orthologues are virtually identical in their primary sequences, with a unique conservative amino acid substitution outside the peptide sequence used to produce antibodies. The in vitro expressed Phox2b protein was recognized by the antibody as a prominent band of ∼32 kDa, and no signal was detectable by using the unpr"

https://openalex.org/W2003974146,"Readily releasable and reserve pools of synaptic vesicles play different roles in neurotransmission, and it is important to understand their recycling and interchange in mature central synapses. Using adult rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes, we have shown that 100 mosm hypertonic sucrose caused complete exocytosis of only the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles containing glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acid. Repetitive hypertonic stimulations revealed that this pool recycled (and reloaded the neurotransmitter from the cytosol) fully in <30 s and did so independently of the reserve pool. Multiple rounds of exocytosis could occur in the constant absence of extracellular Ca(2+). However, although each vesicle cycle includes a Ca(2+)-independent exocytotic step, some other stage(s) critically require an elevation of cytosolic [Ca(2+)], and this is supplied by intracellular stores. Repetitive recycling also requires energy, but not the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, which maintains the normal level of phosphoinositides. By varying the length of hypertonic stimulations, we found that approximately 70% of the RRP vesicles fused completely with the plasmalemma during exocytosis and could then enter silent pools, probably outside active zones. The rest of the RRP vesicles underwent very fast local recycling (possibly by kiss-and-run) and did not leave active zones. Forcing the fully fused RRP vesicles into the silent pool enabled us to measure the transfer of reserve vesicles to the RRP and to show that this process requires intact phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and actin microfilaments. Our findings also demonstrate that respective vesicle pools have similar characteristics and requirements in excitatory and inhibitory nerve terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2130437487,"During sporulation and meiosis of budding yeast a developmental program determines the formation of the new plasma membranes of the spores. This process of prospore membrane (PSM) formation leads to the formation of meiotic daughter cells, the spores, within the lumen of the mother cell. It is initiated at the spindle pole bodies during meiosis II. Spore formation, but not meiotic cell cycle progression, requires the function of phospholipase D (PLD/Spo14). Here we show that PLD/Spo14 forms a complex with Sma1, a meiotically expressed protein essential for spore formation. Detailed analysis revealed that both proteins are required for early steps of prospore membrane assembly but with distinct defects in the respective mutants. In the Δspo14 mutant the initiation of PSM formation is blocked and aggregated vesicles of homogenous size are detected at the spindle pole bodies. In contrast, initiation of PSM formation does occur in the Δsma1 mutant, but the enlargement of the membrane is impaired. During PSM growth both Spo14 and Sma1 localize to the membrane, and localization of Spo14 is independent of Sma1. Biochemical analysis revealed that Sma1 is not necessary for PLD activity per se and that PLD present in a complex with Sma1 is highly active. Together, our results suggest that yeast PLD is involved in two distinct but essential steps during the regulated vesicle fusion necessary for the assembly of the membranous encapsulations of the spores.

During cellular differentiation and development, tightly controlled cell polarity changes occur (1Nelson W.J. Nature. 2003; 422: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). These changes involve redirection of the secretory pathway and specify the site of exocytosis. For these processes, molecular mechanisms exist that ensure correct delivery of membranes and secretory proteins in response to cellular signals. During yeast gametogenesis (sporulation) so-called prospore membranes (PSMs) 5The abbreviations used are: PSMprospore membraneGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPAphosphatidic acidPCphosphatidylcholinePLDphospholipase DSNAREsoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptorsSPBspindle pole body 5The abbreviations used are: PSMprospore membraneGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPAphosphatidic acidPCphosphatidylcholinePLDphospholipase DSNAREsoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptorsSPBspindle pole body form de novo at sites adjacent to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs), the centrosomes of yeast (2Lynn R.R. Magee P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 44: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This process involves redirection of the secretory machinery to the SPB (3Neiman A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and results in formation of four haploid cells within the mother cell. The initiation of this process is a tightly regulated event that occurs exactly once per SPB at the onset of meiosis II. It is thought that PSM formation is initiated by the fusion of vesicles at the SPB that generate an initial compartment, which then subsequently becomes enlarged and grows around the haploid nucleus to which it is connected via the SPB. Only recently support for this model came from the analysis of a Δmso1 mutant in which a block of PSM formation on the level of vesicle fusion at the SPB was visible (39Knop M. Miller K.J. Mazza M. Feng D. Weber M. Keranen S. Jantti J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 10.1091/mbc.E05-03-0243PubMed Google Scholar).The formation of PSMs appears to require several genes known to act in the exocytosis of post-Golgi vesicles in vegetatively growing (mitotic) cells. In temperature-sensitive mutants of sec1, sec4, and sec8 or cells deleted for the syntaxin SSO1, no PSM formation occurs at the restrictive temperature (3Neiman A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 4Jantti J. Aalto M.K. Oyen M. Sundqvist L. Keranen S. Ronne H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 409-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PSM formation requires Spo20, a sporulation-specific Sec9 target SNARE homologue (3Neiman A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In Δspo20 cells the PSMs form but fail to capture the nuclei. This suggests that PSM biogenesis is a developmentally regulated branch of the exocytic pathway (3Neiman A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Currently, the precise vesicle fusion machinery required for the initiation of membrane formation and the way that this machinery is regulated and how it correlates to the machinery required for subsequent membrane elongation during PSM growth are not known. One possible regulator of this pathway is phospholipase D (PLD/Spo14). Spo14 is only essential for spore formation and localizes to the PSMs (5Rudge S.A. Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, PLD has been proposed to participate in cytoskeletal modeling and vesicular traffic in the secretory pathway (6Huijbregts R.P. Topalof L. Bankaitis V.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 7Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 8Vitale N.

This regulation is thought to occur mainly through its capacity to hydrolyze phospholipids in order to generate the second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA). Both the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PLD/Spo14 and the mammalian phospholipase D associate with phosphatidyl inositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2), and PtdIns-4,5-P2 has been shown to be needed for efficient PLD function (9Sciorra V.A.

Morris A.J. Bader M.F. Frohman M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Previously, a systematic approach has identified several genes necessary for meiosis and sporulation (12Rabitsch K.P. Toth A. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Schaffner G. Aigner E. Rupp C. Penkner A.M. Moreno-Borchart A.C. Primig M. Esposito R.E. Klein F. Knop M. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). One of these genes, SMA1, showed a specific defect associated with the formation of the prospore membranes. Here we show that Sma1 is associated with Spo14, the phospholipase D of yeast, and that both proteins are required for related but distinct functions during the assembly of the prospore membranes. Our data are consistent with the idea that PLD plays several roles during this process, including one early Sma1-independent function during the initiation of membrane formation via homotypic vesicle fusion and a later function during elongation of the membrane by heterotypic membrane fusion in association with Sma1.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains, Growth Conditions, and Plasmids—The yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TABLE ONE. For vegetative growth, standard conditions were used (13Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods in Enzymology: Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 1991; 194: 429Google Scholar). For sporulation, the previously described pre-growth regime was used (14Knop M. Strasser K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3657-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Sporulation medium was 0.3% (w/v) potassium acetate in water. For cell biological and biochemical analysis, sporulation was carried out until maximal amounts of cells (∼60%) were undergoing meiosis II (5.5-6.5 h after induction of sporulation as judged by 4,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining or Don1-GFP fluorescence, a marker of the developing PSM) (14Knop M. Strasser K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3657-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Gene deletion (of SPO14 or SMA1) and C-terminal tagging of SMA1 were performed using the previously described PCR strategy (15Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). N-terminal tagging of SPO14 with either GFP or 3×HA (GFP-SPO14 and HA-SPO14) was performed using a PCR-based insertion of the CUP1-1 promoter (bp -472 to -1 of the promoter from the CUP1-1 gene) using the previously described PCR tagging strategy (16Janke C. Magiera M.M. Rathfelder N. Taxis C. Reber S. Maekawa H. Moreno-Borchart A. Doenges G. Schwob E. Schiebel E. Knop M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 947-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). SPO14 expression from the CUP1 promoter was induced with 3 μm CuSO4 at a time point during sporulation before the cells enter meiosis II (4 h after induction of sporulation). This leads to a wild type level of sporulation of the strains and a protein level of Spo14 that is ∼2 to 3-fold higher than in wild type cells as judged using Western blotting and antibodies specific to Spo14. The plasmids used are shown in TABLE ONE. For cloning, routine molecular biological methods were used. PCR-cloned DNA fragments were fully sequenced.TABLE ONEYeast strains and plasmidsStrainGenotypeSourceNKY289Mata ura3 lys2 ho::hisG (SK-1 background)37Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N.

Strasser K. Finkbeiner M.G. Shevchenko A. Knop M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6946-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and nonspecific rabbit IgGs cross-linked to Dynabeads (Dynal). Upon several washes with the same buffer the proteins were eluted with 1% SDS at 65 °C for 5 min. Eluted proteins were analyzed using NU-PAGE 4-20% gradient gels (Invitrogen) with MOPS gel running buffer followed by Coomassie staining. Sma1-protein A was identified using the PAP detection reagent (Dako). Polyclonal antibodies specific for full-length Sma1 or Spo14 (amino acids 1-200) were generated using N-terminally His-tagged bacterial expressed proteins (plasmids pMAX3-1 and pUK22, respectively). Antibodies were affinity-purified. The specificity of the purified antibodies was verified using extracts of vegetative cells that either overexpress the protein (Sma1) or meiotic extracts of cells deleted for the SPO14 gene (data not shown). Antibodies specific for tubulin, GFP, and Ady3 have been described previously (17Moreno-Borchart A.C. Strasser K. Finkbeiner M.G. Shevchenko A. Knop M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6946-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The HA (12CA5) used for immunoprecipitations was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Anti-HA immunoprecipitations of 3×HA-tagged proteins were performed using the same buffer as for protein A purification, and anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibodies were cross-linked to protein G-Dynabeads (Dynal) according to the instruction of the manufacturer. Cells were broken using acid-washed glass beads and 50 OD600 units of cells in buffer without Nonidet P-40. Upon lysis Nonidet P-40 was added, and extracts were cleared at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Upon immunoprecipitation the beads were washed 5 times, and bound proteins were eluted with 6 m urea, 5% SDS, and 200 mm NaxHyPO4, pH 6.8, at 65 °C for 5 min and adjusted to 100 mm dithiothreitol for gel electrophoresis. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 60 min in the medium (adjusted to 0.1 m KxHyPO4, pH 6.5). Digestion of cells using Zymolyase 100T and immunolabeling was performed as described (14Knop M. Strasser K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3657-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (a detailed protocol can be obtained upon request). For double labeling (Figs. 2. a-d, and 3, c and d) primary antibodies (from mouse and rabbit) were detected using Cy2- and Cy3-labeled goat antibodies. For triple labeling, primary antibodies (from sheep, mouse, and rabbit) were detected using Cy2-, Cy3-, and Cy5-labeled donkey antibodies. In some cases, Alexa 486 was used as dye instead of Cy2. Faithful discrimination of different fluorophores was always verified using appropriate controls. For detection, filter sets from Chroma were used (Piston filter set for Cy2 and Alexa 486 and Cy3 and Cy5 filter sets). Images were recorded on a Leica DMX using a 100× PlanApo oil objective with a numerical aperture of 1.4 and a CoolSNAP cf camera (12 bit, 4.65 × 4.65 μm pixel size, 1392 × 1040 pixels) from Photometrics and Metamorph software. Image stacks were collected (0.3-μm spacing). Maximum projections containing the relevant slices (usually 4-5) are shown. Image processing was restricted to linear contrast enhancements. Electron microscopy of sporulating yeast cells using the glutaraldehyde/KMnO4 protocol followed by Agar 100 embedding was performed as described previously (17Moreno-Borchart A.C. Strasser K.

PLD activity assays, either using whole cells or immunoisolated protein complexes from sporulating yeast, were performed as described (5Rudge S.A. Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).RESULTSMutants deleted for the SMA1 gene are unable to form spores upon meiosis (12Rabitsch K.P. Toth A. Galova M.

To gain insight into the molecular function of Sma1, we tagged it with protein A and purified it from meiotic cell extracts. The Sma1-protein A fusion was fully functional as judged by its ability to promote spore formation (data not shown). This approach revealed one major co-purifying protein of ∼200 kDa (Fig. 1a), which was subsequently identified using MALDI-TOF measurements as PLD/Spo14. The other co-purifying proteins were found to be most likely nonspecifically bound proteins (see “Discussion”). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with extracts prepared from meiotic cells confirmed the interaction between Sma1 and PLD/Spo14 in both directions (Fig. 1b). In vegetative cells Sma1 is not expressed (data not shown) (18Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar); however, when ectopically expressed, it co-immunoprecipitated with Spo14 (Fig. 1c). This result indicates that no meiosis-specific factor is required for the association of Sma1 with PLD/Spo14.FIGURE 1PLD/Spo14 forms a protein complex with Sma1. a, extracts from meiotic cells expressing Sma1-protein A (YCR11) or untagged Sma1 were used to immunoisolate Sma1-protein A/LH177 (Sma1-ProtA).

Strains used were YMK693, YMK695, YAM255, and YMK713; all HA tags used were triple tags. The top two blots show HA-Spo14 and Sma1-HA present in the extracts before and after immunoprecipitations.

Plasmids used were p423-ADH and pCR3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PLD/Spo14 was shown previously to be necessary for sporulation, and the protein, when over expressed, localized to the areas of the SPBs in meiosis II (5Rudge S.A. Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the sites where the prospore membranes become assembled. Mutant cells deleted for SPO14 are not affected in progression through meiosis but do not form spores, and the absence of immature spores was confirmed by electron microscopy (5Rudge S.A. Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To characterize the meiotic Δspo14 phenotype with respect to prospore membrane assembly and compare it with the Δsma1 phenotype, we performed a detailed comparative characterization of Δsma1 and Δspo14 mutants during meiosis. For this, we first used fluorescence microscopy and antibodies specific for Ady3p, a marker for developing PSMs (Fig. 2a) (17Moreno-Borchart A.C. Strasser K. Finkbeiner M.G. Shevchenko A. Knop M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6946-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Tubulin staining was used to precisely identify cells in meiosis II (two spindles within one cell) and the positions of the SPBs, which are at the ends of the microtubule bundles.The results demonstrate that the Δspo14 mutant (Fig. 2c) and the Δsma1 mutant (Fig. 2d) fail to assemble prospore membranes. The Ady3 staining seen in the two mutants differs from each other, suggesting different defects with regard to prospore membrane assembly in the two mutants.PSM assembly is initiated on top of the SPBs metaphase/anaphase of meiosis II (14Knop M. Strasser K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3657-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Moens P.B. Rapport E. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 344-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20Okamoto S.

For a more precise estimation of the defects, we also used a wild type strain and a strain deleted for two structural proteins of the meiotic SPB, Mpc54p and Mpc70p. In the wild type strain during the anaphase of meiosis II, Ady3 forms doughnut-shaped, ring-like structures in wild type cells (often visible as rods when viewed from top; see white outlined arrowhead in Fig. 2a), which are indicative of assembled PSMs. At this stage, Ady3 localizes to a coat governing the leading edge of the growing prospore membrane (LEP (leading edge protein) coat) (17Moreno-Borchart A.C. Strasser K. Finkbeiner M.G. Shevchenko A. Knop M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6946-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the Δmpc54 Δmpc70 mutant the formation of the meiosis II-specific appendix of the SPB, the meiotic plaque, is impaired, and the assembly of PSMs is completely blocked (14Knop M. Strasser K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3657-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Bajgier B.K. Malzone M. Nickas M. Neiman A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this case, Ady3 exhibited staining at the SPBs and dotted structures in the cytoplasm as shown previously (17Moreno-Borchart A.C. Strasser K. Finkbeiner M.G. Shevchenko A. Knop M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6946-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2b). Some of these dotted structures (called precursor structures) co-localize with the syntaxins Sso1 and Sso2 and may result from the clustering of secretory vesicles (17Moreno-Borchart A.C. Strasser K. Finkbeiner M.G. Shevchenko A. Knop M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6946-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Interestingly, Ady3p staining at the SPBs was apparent also in the Δspo14 and Δsma1 mutants, (Fig. 2, c and d, white arrowheads), whereas no rods or donuts indicative of assembled LEP coats and PSMs were seen. For Δsma1 few precursor structures remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2d), whereas in the Δspo14 mutant a high staining of Ady3 in the cytoplasm with few discrete precursor structures was seen (Fig. 2c; quantification in Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the precursor structures seen at the SPBs in the Δsma1 mutant appeared larger and brighter than the ones seen in the other mutants (Fig. 2f). These data suggest that Spo14 and Sma1 promote prospore membrane assembly at the level of membrane formation at the SPBs during meiosis II, but with recognizable differences between the two mutants.Using electron microscopy we investigated the precise defect in the Δsma1 and Δspo14 mutants with regard to the processes of initiation of PSM formation at the SPBs. Once again, we used wild type and Δmpc54 Δmpc70 mutant strains for comparison (Fig. 2g). This comparison revealed that, in the Δmpc54 Δmpc70 mutant but also in the Δspo14 mutant, vesicles of homogeneous size (60-70 nm) could be found adjacent to the cytoplasmic side of the SPBs, whereas in wild type cells an assembled prospore membrane was always visible. In the Δspo14 mutant a fully assembled meiotic plaque was visible (Fig. 2g), whereas in the Δmpc54 Δmpc70 mutant this structure was missing as reported previously (14Knop M. Strasser K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3657-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the Δsma1 mutant the vesicles seemed to have fused to small prospore membranes; however, their enlargement appeared to be impaired, and only small PSMs, often with many vesicles adjacent, were found (Fig. 2g). These results suggest that the Δspo14 and the Δsma1 mutants display different defects during the early process of initiation of prospore membrane biogenesis after the assembly of the meiotic plaque has taken place.To investigate the localization of Sma1, we tagged the SMA1 gene on its chromosomal location with GFP. This led to a fully functional gene fusion, as sporulation occurred at wild type frequency in this strain. Western blotting confirmed the expression profiling data showing that Sma1 is only expressed during mid-late phases of meiosis when spore formation is initiated (data not shown) (18Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that Sma1-GFP localizes to the prospore membrane during the stage of membrane growth (Fig. 3a). No Sma1-GFP signal was detected in the cells during earlier stages of meiosis when the initiation of prospore membrane assembly has not yet started. Co-immunolabeling of HA-Spo14 and Sma1-GFP in the same cells demonstrated that both proteins localize to the prospore membrane in a similar manner (Fig. 3b). Also in the Δmpc54 Δmpc70 mutants no discrete localization of Sma1-GFP to Ady30-labeled structures was visible (data not shown). In contrast, HA-Spo14p was found to co-localize partially to Ady3-labeled structures in the Δmpc54 Δmpc70 mutant (Fig. 3c), suggesting binding of Spo14 to precursors of the PSM before it becomes assembled. HA-Spo14 localizes all along the prospore membrane, and hardly any HA-Spo14 can be detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3d, top row). In the Δsma1 mutant HA-Spo14 could still be found to localize to the small prospore membrane structures that become assembled in this mutant (Fig. 3d, arrows in lower row); however, a cytoplasmic pool of HA-Spo14 was also detected. We could not perform the converse experiment, namely the localization of Sma1 to the prospore membrane in the Δspo14 mutant because of the impaired PSM assembl"
https://openalex.org/W2151953174,"The two regulatory residues that control the enzymatic activity of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK2 are phosphorylated by the unique MAP kinase kinases MEK1/2 and dephosphorylated by several tyrosine-specific and dual specificity protein phosphatases. Selective docking interactions facilitate these phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, controlling the specificity and duration of the MAP kinase activation-inactivation cycles. We have analyzed the contribution of specific residues of ERK2 in the physical and functional interaction with the ERK2 phosphatase inactivators PTP-SL and MKP-3 and with its activator MEK1. Single mutations in ERK2 that abrogated the dephosphorylation by endogenous tyrosine phosphatases from HEK293 cells still allowed efficient phosphorylation by endogenous MEK1/2. Discrete ERK2 mutations at the ERK2 docking groove differentially affected binding and inactivation by PTP-SL and MKP-3. Remarkably, the cytosolic retention of ERK2 by its activator MEK1 was not affected by any of the analyzed ERK2 single amino acid substitutions. A chimeric MEK1 protein, containing the kinase interaction motif of PTP-SL, bound tightly to ERK2 through its docking groove and behaved as a gain-of-function MAP kinase kinase that hyperactivated ERK2. Our results provide evidence that the ERK2 docking groove is more restrictive and selective for its tyrosine phosphatase inactivators than for MEK1/2 and indicate that distinct ERK2 residues modulate the docking interactions with activating and inactivating effectors.

The specificity of MAP kinase signaling is controlled by docking interactions, which provide high affinity binding between MAP kinases and their effector proteins, including substrates, activators (MAP kinase kinases), inactivators (phosphatases), and scaffolding proteins. These docking interactions improve the efficiency of the enzymatic reactions between the two molecules involved and are distinct from the transient interactions that occur during catalysis through the active sites of the enzymes. Therefore, docking interactions are crucial for the correct and specific recognition of MAP kinases by their functional partners. Two types of MAP kinase docking motifs have been identified in MAP kinase-interacting proteins. They are featured by clusters of basic and hydrophobic residues, with either an arginine- and leucine-, isoleucine-, or valine-rich motif (kinase interaction motif (KIM), D site, DEJL motif, δ domain) or a phenylalanine-rich motif (DEF motif). These motifs, alone or in combination, form a modular system that mediates molecular recognition by MAP kinases (6Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem.

The regulation of the kinase activity relies on the flexibility of the activation loop (loop L12) that, upon phosphorylation by specific MAP kinase kinases, refolds and activates catalysis (12Canagarajah B.J.

These studies, together with mutational analysis studies, highlighted the existence of several docking sites on different structural elements of the MAP kinase. In particular, studies with extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) have defined an acidic patch on the surface-exposed loop L16 of the kinase opposite to its catalytic cleft, which acts as a MAP kinase conserved docking motif (CD site; residues 310–325) common to substrates, activators, and inactivators (16Rubinfeld H.

Additional residues, located in loop L11 (ED site; residues 152–167), together with the CD site residues, have been proposed to form the ERK2 docking groove (20Tárrega C. Blanco-Aparicio C.

The anti-GST rabbit polyclonal antiserum was obtained by immunization of rabbits with purified recombinant GST. To generate a polyclonal antiserum (anti-LexA) recognizing two-hybrid bait proteins expressed from pEG202-derived plasmids, a 640-bp LexA DNA binding domain-encoding HindIII-BamHI fragment was excised from pEG202. The fragment was subjected to a Klenow fill-in reaction to blunt the ends and cloned into SmaI-digested pGEX-1N. The resulting pGEX-LexA plasmid was introduced into DH5α strain, and GST fusion proteins were induced and isolated as described (48Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal.

For kinase assays, GST fusion proteins from bacteria were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose; after washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the pellets were washed once with kinase reaction buffer and used as substrates in the kinase assays. GST fusion proteins expressed in HEK293 mammalian cells were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h; then the glutathione-Sepharose beads were pulled down by centrifugation and washed four times with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). After a final washing with phosphate-buffered saline or with the appropriate reaction buffer, pellets were used as GST pull-down reagents (Fig. 8, A and B) or as the enzymes in the phosphatase (Fig. 5) and kinase (Fig. 9C) assays, respectively.FIGURE 5Differential dephosphorylation of ERK2 E79A mutation by PTP-SL and MKP-3. HEK293 cells were transfected with pCDNA3-HA-ERK2 wild type (wt) or E79A mutation, as indicated. After 48 h, the cells were treated with EGF for 5 min and lysed with lysis buffer type B, and HA-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated (i.p.) from equal amounts of cell lysates with the anti-HA 12CA5 mAb. The immune complexes were subjected to in vitro phosphatase assay in the presence of increasing amounts of GST-PTP-SL or GST-MKP3 bound to glutathione-Sepharose, as indicated. GST fusion proteins were obtained by pull-down from lysates of HEK293 cells (lysis buffer type A, without Na3VO4) transfected with pRK5-GST-PTP-SL or pRK5-GST-MKP-3. The reaction mixtures (final volume 50 μl) were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. The phosphoactive content of HA-ERK2 was measured by immunoblot with anti-phosphoactive-ERK1/2 mAb (anti-ppERK1/2; upper panel). The input of HA-ERK2 and GST fusion proteins was monitored by immunoblot with anti-HA 12CA5 mAb and with anti-GST polyclonal antibody, respectively (middle and lower panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 9Comparative phosphorylation and activation of ERK2 by MEK1 and by (KIM-SL)MEK1.A, comparative phosphorylation of ERK2 and p38α by MEK1 and (KIM-SL)MEK1.

Then the cells were lysed (lysis buffer type B), and HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA 12CA5 mAb. Immune complexes were subjected to in vitro kinase assays in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and GST-ERK2-K52A or GST-p38α-K53A bound to glutathione-Sepharose as the substrates (left panels). The samples were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Coomassie staining (lower left panel) and autoradiography (upper left panel). The equal expression of the HA-tagged MEK1 proteins is shown in the right panel, as detected by immunoblot with anti-HA 12CA5 mAb. B, the ERK2 D319N gain-of-function mutation hampers the phosphorylation by (KIM-SL)MEK1 but not the phosphorylation by MEK1. The two diagrams represent the quantification of immune complex kinase assays using GST-ERK2-K52A or GST-ERK2-K52A/D319N as the substrates, as in A. In the upper diagram, the phosphorylation of the ERK2 substrates by HA-MEK1 or HA-(KIM-SL)MEK1 is shown. In the lower diagram, the phosphorylation of the ERK2 substrates by constitutively active HA-MEK1 SESD or HA-(KIM-SL)MEK1 SESD is shown. Data are presented as the percentage of phosphorylation with respect to that shown by ERK2-K52A phosphorylated by MEK1 or MEK1 SESD (100%). Equal amounts of the different kinases were used as shown in Fig. 9A, right panel. The values represent the mean of at least three separate experiments ± S.D. C, increased activation of ERK2 by (KIM-SL)MEK1. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with pRK5-GST-ERK2 plus pCDNA3-HA-MEK1 SESD or pCDNA3-HA-(KIM-SL)MEK1 SESD. After 48 h, the cells were lysed (lysis buffer type B), and equal amounts of cell lysates containing GST-ERK2 were pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose. The complexes were subjected to in vitro kinase assays, in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and MBP (2 μg) as the substrate. The samples were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography (upper panel). The expression of HA-MEK1 and GST-ERK2 is shown in the middle and lower panels, respectively, as monitored by immunoblot with anti-HA 12CA5 mAb or anti-GST polyclonal antibody. In the lower diagram, a quantification of the MBP phosphorylated bands is shown. Data are presented as the percentage of MBP phosphorylation with respect to that shown by MBP phosphorylated by ERK2 activated by MEK1 SESD (100%). The values represent the mean of at least three separate experiments ± S.D. To rule out the possibility that the MBP substrate was phosphorylated also by MEK1 SESD or (KIM-SL)MEK1 SESD, coprecipitated in the kinase complexes with ERK2, kinase assays were performed under the same conditions using MEK1 SESD or (KIM-SL)MEK1 SESD as the kinases and MBP as the substrate. No phosphorylation of MBP by MEK1 SESD or (KIM-SL)MEK1 was detected (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RT-PCR Analysis—RT-PCR was performed using total RNA (0.5 μg/sample) from HEK293 cells (Ambion Inc.) and the Titan One Tube RT-PCR Kit (Roche Applied Science), following the manufacturer's instructions. Specific oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify cDNA fragments corresponding to the N-terminal portions (noncatalytic regions) of the distinct human MAP kinase phosphatases (49Alonso A.

All primers are available upon request.Quantitative Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assays—The yeast strain EGY48 was cotransformed with pMW107 (lacZ reporter plasmid), pEG202-PTP-SL or pEG202-MKP-3 (lexA-DNA binding domain fusion proteins), and the empty pJG4-5 plasmid or pJG4-5-ERK2 wild type or mutations (B42 activation domain-HA fusion proteins) using the lithium acetate method and plated on appropriate selection medium. To determine the relative strength of the two-hybrid bait-prey interactions, β-galactosidase activity measurements were performed on crude yeast protein extracts obtained from liquid overnight cultures. Briefly, yeast cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in LacZ buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4). Lysates were obtained by adding 0.1% SDS and chloroform to the resuspended cells, followed by vortexing. One fraction was used to determine the protein concentration according to the Bradford method and to determine the relative expression levels of the various ERK2, PTP-SL, and MKP-3 bait and prey fusion proteins by immunoblot. Another fraction was processed in 96-well microtiter plates to assay for β-galactosidase activity. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) substrate (2 mg/ml final concentration) plus β-mercaptoethanol (25 mm final concentration). The hydrolysis of ONPG was monitored for 1 h at 30°C by measuring absorbance at 405 nm every minute. The β-galactosidase activity (arbitrary units) was calculated as the quotient between the slope of the linear part of the absorbance versus time plot and the total protein concentration. Experiments were performed analyzing simultaneously five separate transformant colonies for each bait and prey plasmid combination.In Vitro Phosphatase and Kinase Assays—For in vitro phosphatase assays, EGF-activated HA-ERK2, immunoprecipitated from HEK293 transfected cells, was used as the substrate. HA-ERK2 pellets were washed with HNTG and subsequently once with phosphatase reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol). Pellets were resuspended in phosphatase reaction buffer, divided into three equal fractions, and incubated with increasing amounts of GST-PTP-SL or GST-MKP-3 (from transfected HEK293 mammalian cells) bound to glutathione-Sepharose under constant shaking. Phosphatase reactions and detection of phosphorylated HA-ERK2 was performed as described (20Tárrega C. Blanco-Aparicio C. Muñoz J.J. Pulido R. J. Biol.

For in vitro kinase assays, MBP or GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose, purified from bacteria, were used as the substrates. Activated HA-ERK2, GST-ERK2, and HA-MEK1, precipitated from transfected HEK293 cells, were used as the enzymes in the kinase assays. Assays with HA-ERK2 and GST-ERK2 were performed in kinase reaction buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 0.3 μm ATP) as described (20Tárrega C.

Assays with HA-MEK1 were performed for 30 min at 30 °C, with constant shaking, in kinase reaction buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μm ATP), in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. All of the reaction mixtures were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling, and samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Where indicated, phosphorylated bands were excised from the gel, and radioactivity was quantified using a scintillation counter.RESULTSMutations at Different Structural Elements within ERK2 Confer Resistance to Dephospho"
https://openalex.org/W2113216468,"PDX-1 regulates transcription of genes involved in islet β cell function and pancreas development. Islet-specific expression is controlled by 5′-flanking sequences from base pair (bp) -2917 to -1918 in transgenic experiments, which encompasses both conserved (i.e. Area I (bp -2761/-2457), Area II (bp -2153/-1923)) and non-conserved pdx-1 sequences. However, only an Area II-driven transgene is independently active in vivo, albeit in only a fraction of islet PDX-1-producing cells. Our objective was to identify the sequences within the -2917/-1918-bp region that act in conjunction with Area II to allow comprehensive expression in islet PDX-1+ cells. In cell line-based transfection assays, only Area I effectively potentiated Area II activity. Both Area I and Area II functioned in an orientation-independent manner, whereas synergistic, enhancer-like activation was uniquely found with duplicated Area II. Chimeras of Area II and the generally active SV40 enhancer or the β cell-specific insulin enhancer suggested that islet cell-enriched activators were necessary for Area I activation, because Area II-mediated stimulation was reduced by the SV40 enhancer and activated by the insulin enhancer. Several conserved sites within Area I were important in Area I/Area II activation, with binding at bp -2614/-2609 specifically controlled by Nkx2.2, an insulin gene regulator that is required for terminal β cell differentiation. The ability of Area I to modulate Area II activation was also observed in vivo, as an Area I/Area II-driven transgene recapitulated the endogenous pdx-1 expression pattern in developing and adult islet cells. These results suggest that Area II is a central pdx-1 control region, whose islet cell activity is uniquely modified by Area I regulatory factors.

Initially detected in dorsal gut endoderm by embryonic day (E) 8.5 in mice, PDX-1 later becomes widely expressed during development in the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds, as well as the duodenal endoderm (1.Offield M.F.

The impact of PDX-1 on pancreatic development is more profound than any other characterized exocrine- or islet-enriched transcription factor, all of which act at later steps, with most affecting the formation of specific pancreatic cell types (5.Melloul D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1014: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6.Servitja J.M. Ferrer J. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 597-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PDX-1 is principally expressed within adult pancreas islet β cells and a small fraction of δ cells, where it regulates cell type-specific gene expression (e.g. insulin, glucose transporter type 2, β-glucokinase in β cells; somatostatin in δ cells) (7.McKinnon C.M. Docherty K. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 1203-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the conditional removal of pdx-1 from islet β cells in mice results in a diabetic phenotype, presumably due (at least) to reduced insulin and glucose transporter type 2 expression (8.Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonsson L. Simu K. Edlund H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). A PDX-1 heterozygous state causes glucose intolerance in mice, whereas humans develop maturity onset diabetes of the young (termed MODY4), a monogenic form of Type II diabetes (9.Stoffers D.A.

Because PDX-1 is a critical transcriptional regulator of both pancreatic organogenesis and islet β cell activity, efforts have focused on identifying the factors important for tissue-specific expression. Transgenic analysis has demonstrated that cell type-specific expression in the pancreas, stomach, and duodenum is mediated by sequences within 6.5 or 4.5 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription start site in the rat and mouse genes, respectively (4.Stoffers D.A.

This area contains several domains of significant identity between mouse, human, and chicken, termed Areas I (mouse bp -2761 to -2457), III (bp -1879 to -1600), and IV (bp -6529 to -6047), and one mammalian-specific identity domain, Area II (bp -2153 to -1923) (14.Gerrish K.

The -2917 to -1918-bp region of mouse pdx-1, a nuclease-hypersensitive domain that includes Areas I and II, is sufficient to direct transgene expression to islet β cells in vivo (12.Wu K.L. Gannon M.

Biol. 2001; 238: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, neither Area I nor contiguous Area III was capable of independently directing expression to islet cells in vivo (18.Samaras S.E. Cissell M.A. Gerrish K. Wright C.V. Gannon M. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4702-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although an Area II transgene is expressed in a β cell-specific manner, activity is only found in a fraction of the PDX-1 positive β cell population (13.Gannon M. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Dev. Biol. 2001; 238: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18.Samaras S.E. Cissell M.A. Gerrish K. Wright C.V. Gannon M. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4702-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggested that factors binding to Area II and non-Area II sequences within bp -2917 to -1918 play a critical role in regulating pdx-1 transcription. The primary objective of this study was to identify the sequences within bp -2917 to -1918 that cooperate with Area II to direct temporal and spatial transgenic expression in the islet. Cell line-based assays suggested that distinct properties of Area I were necessary for potentiating Area II-directed activity, in that neither non-conserved pdx-1 region sequences nor the ubiquitously active SV40 enhancer region were able to reproduce the precise β cell-selective regulatory properties of bp -2917/-1918. In addition, the β cell-specific enhancer of the rodent insulin gene was able to stimulate Area II activity, but differently than Area I. Activation of Area I/Area II was shown to be mediated by Nkx2.2, a homeodomain protein of the NK-2 class that is essential for proper islet β cell formation and function (21.Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A transgene driven by Area I/Area II alone was first detected in vivo within developing insulin+ cells destined to populate the islet, and later to recapitulate the expression pattern of the endogenous gene in adult islets. The co-expression of Nkx2.2 in Area I/Area II transgene expressing cells is consistent with a role in both early developing and adult islet pdx-1 transcription. Collectively, the data indicate that islet cell-specific expression of pdx-1 is principally controlled by transcription factors controlling Area I/Area II-mediated activity. Transfection Constructs—The pdx-1 reporter constructs were made using mouse and human sequences, which were cloned directly upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) minimal promoter in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression vector, pTK(An) CAT. The construction of the pdx-1:pTK constructs representing the -2917/-1918-bp region (mouse, Pst/-2917:Bst/-1918 bp; human, -2839/-2023 bp), Area I (mouse, -2761/-2457 bp; human, -2839/-2521 bp), Area II (mouse, -2153/-1923 bp; human, -2252/-2023 bp), or Area IV (mouse, -6529/-6010 bp) were described previously (16.Gerrish K.

The Area I block transversion mutants and bp -2613,-2612 mutation in S6 were constructed in -2917/-1918:pTK and/or Area I:pTK using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The pdx-1 sequences were cloned in the forward orientation in each of the 2×Area I:pTK, 2×Area II:pTK, and 2×Area IV:pTK plasmids.

The conditions for the competition analyses were the same, except that a 50–100-fold excess of the unlabeled specific competitor DNA was included in the mixture prior to addition of radiolabeled probe. The TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system (Promega) was used to in vitro transcribe and translate Nkx2.2 (pCRII-Nkx2.2, Palle Serup, Hagedorn Research Institute, Gentofte, Denmark). Nkx2.2 monoclonal antibody (74.5A5; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA) was preincubated with extract protein for 10 min prior to the addition of the DNA probe. The probe and competitor sequences were: mouse S6 (5′-ATTTATCCATAAGAGCTGCTGTTA-3′); mouse S6 block mutant (5′-ATTTATCCAcggagaCTGCTGTTA-3′); mouse S6 -2613, -2612 mutant (5′-ATTTATCCATggGAGCTGCTGTTA-3′); rat Insulin II Nkx2.2 -140/-119 (5′-ACCAGGGAAGTGTTTGGAAACT-3′) (28.Cissell M.A. Zhao L.

Core-like Nkx2.2 binding sequences are underlined and mutated nucleotides are lowercase. The samples were electrophoresed on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 150 V for 2 h under high ionic strength polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis conditions before drying and autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—βTC-3 cells (0.5–1.0 × 108) were formaldehyde cross-linked, and the sonicated protein-DNA complexes were isolated under conditions described previously (20.Gerrish K. Cissell M.A. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47775-47784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Nkx2.2 (25 μl; 74.5A5), normal rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; 10 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or no antibody was added to the sonicated chromatin, followed by incubation for 1 h at 4°C. Antibody-protein-DNA complexes were isolated by incubation with protein A/G-PLUS agarose slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PCR was performed on one-tenth of the purified, immunoprecipitated DNA using Ready-to-Go PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) and 15 pmol of each primer. The primers used for amplification of mouse Area I were: 5′-CCACTAAGAAGGAAGGCCAG-3′ (-2785) and 5′-CTGAGGTTCTTTCTCTGCCTCTCTG-3′ (-2435); and for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were: 5′-GAGTGACACCTCACAGCTGTGG-3′ (-434) and 5′-GGCAGGCCTTTGGATCATAGCC-3′ (-96). Cycling parameters were one cycle of 95 °C for 2 min and 28 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s; 59 (Area I) or 61 °C (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) for 30 s; and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. Amplified products were electrophoresed through a 1.4% agarose gel in TAE buffer and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Area I/Area II Transgene Construction and Generation of Transgenic Mice—Mouse Area I (-2759 to -2439 bp) was fused directly upstream of Area II (-2200 to -1923 bp) and ligated just 5′ to the heat shock protein (hsp) minimal promoter in hsp681lacZpA, a bacterial β-galactosidase (lacZ) expression plasmid (12.Wu K.L.

Wright C.V. Dev. Biol. 2001; 238: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). DNA was NotI digested and the isolated Area I/Area IIhsp-lacZ transgene injected within the Vanderbilt Transgenic Mouse/ES Cell Shared Resource into the pronuclei of one-cell embryos from B6D2 females, and embryos were transplanted into pseudopregnant ICR females. The F0 founders were used to establish transgenic lines. Area I/Area IIhsp-lacZ transgenics were identified by PCR analysis using primers to lacZ with DNA from neonatal leg or adult tail tissue prepared using the Puregene DNA Purification Kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). X-Gal Staining—Neonatal digestive organs were fixed for 3 h in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, then washed three times in permeabilization solution (0.2% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline). Activity from β-galactosidase was detected using X-gal as described (12.Wu K.L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.F. Henderson E. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macroscopic pictures were taken using a Stemi 2000-C microscope (Zeiss) and Nikon 5700 digital camera. Immunohistochemistry—Abdominal organs and pancreata were fixed as described above, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and then 6-μm serial sections were mounted on glass slides. Immunofluorescence was performed using rabbit α,β-galactosidase (1:5000; Molecular Probes), guinea pig α-insulin (1:2000; Linco Research Immunoassay, St. Charles, MO), guinea pig α-glucagon (1:2000; Linco), guinea pig α-pancreatic polypeptide (1:2000; Linco), sheep α-somatostatin (1:2000; American Research Products, Belmont, MA), and mouse α-Nkx2.2 (1:200; 74.5A5) primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were Cy-2, Cy-3, or Cy-5-conjugated donkey α-guinea pig, α-rabbit, α-mouse, and α-sheep (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Fluorescent images were captured with an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss) at an optical depth of 1 μm. Nuclear counterstaining was performed using YoPro1, 1:1000 (Molecular Probes). Quantification was determined on serial adult pancreas (8 weeks of age) sections that were co-stained for β-galactosidase/insulin or β-galactosidase/somatostatin through a depth of at least 96-μm. Optical section images were captured using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope and processed as TIFF images in Adobe Photoshop. Area I/Area II Alone Controls the β Cell Line-specific Activation Properties of the -2917/-1918-bp Region—A comprehensive transgenic analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse pdx-1 gene revealed that the -2917 to -1918 bp region was uniquely capable of directing islet cell-selective expression (13.Gannon M. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Dev. Biol. 2001; 238: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This region is found within a larger β cell-specific nuclease-hypersensitive domain that spans blocks of conserved (i.e. Areas I (mouse bp -2761/-2457), II (bp -2153/-1923), III (bp -1879/-1600), and non-conserved sequences (12.Wu K.L.

Henderson E. Stoffel M. Wright C.V. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3485-3492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Individually, only Areas I and II effectively directed β cell-selective activation in transfection based assays, although their isolated activities were less effective than the -2917/-1918 bp-driven reporter (14.Gerrish K.

Shoshkes M. Havin L. Cerasi E. Melloul D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7583-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The activity of these conserved domains was also compromised relative to the -2917/-1918 bp-driven transgene in vivo. Thus, whereas Area II was able to direct transgenic expression to islet cells, activity was only found in a small fraction of the PDX-1 producing cells detected with the -2917/-1918 bp-driven transgene (18.Samaras S.E. Cissell M.A. Gerrish K. Wright C.V. Gannon M. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4702-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results indicate that functional interactions between Area II and non-Area II sequences are required to obtain -2917/-1918 bp-like regulation. To analyze the activation properties of the non-conserved sequences within the -2917/-1918-bp region, mouse pdx-1 sequences from -2917 to -2762 and -2456 to -2145 were subcloned directly upstream of the minimal TK promoter sequences in the CAT expression plasmid, pTK(An). Their activity was compared with -2917/-1918 bp-, Area I-, and Area II:pTK constructs in transfected β (βTC-3, MIN6) and non-β (NIH-3T3) cell lines; the regulatory behavior of the various pdx-1:pTK constructs was found to be similar between β cell lines. The β cell line-specific activation properties of each construct is expressed as the ratio of pdx-1:pTK activity in β cells to that of NIH3T3. Only constructs containing Area I and/or Area II sequences were selectively activated in β cells (Fig. 1), with non-conserved driven constructs non-functional (i.e. -2917/-2762:pTK, -2456/-2145:pTK). Significantly, a mouse pdx-1 construct driven by Area I/Area II alone had the same β cell-selective stimulation properties as the expansive -2917/-1918:pTK. Reversing the order of Area I and II also did not change β cell activity relative to Area I/Area II:pTK or -2917/-1918: pTK (see Area II/Area I in Fig. 1). In contrast, the non-conserved sequences in the -2917/-1918 region did not stimulate Area I or Area II activation (data not shown). The identity between mouse and human Area I and Area II is, respectively, 89 and 78% (14.Gerrish K. Gannon M. Shih D. Henderson E. Stoffel M. Wright C.V. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3485-3492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), presumably reflecting why cooperative activation was observed in chimeric Area I/Area II:pTK constructs (Fig. 2). These data suggest that conserved Area I and Area II control sequences are the principal mediators of the islet cell-specific activation properties of the -2917/-1918-bp region.FIGURE 2Human and mouse Areas I and II are functionally interchangeable. Human (h) and mouse (m) chimeric Area I/Area II transfection constructs were created in pTK and transfected into βTC-3 cells.

(Unfortunately, this analysis could not be extended to Area III, as this conserved region was inactive in transfection and transgenic experiments (13.Gannon M. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Dev. Biol. 2001; 238: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14.Gerrish K. Gannon M. Shih D. Henderson E. Stoffel M. Wright C.V. Stein R. J. Biol.

Each region was active in either the normal or reverse orientation (Fig. 3A), although orientation somewhat influenced the magnitude of stimulation. The activity of the duplicated constructs were compared with both the single copy and the Area I/Area II construct, with control regions maintained in the normal orientation in each multimerized pdx-1 construct. The 2×Area II-driven reporter had unique functional properties when compared with 2×Area I:pTK or 2×Area IV:pTK in β cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, the increase in activity of 2× Area I was additive, whereas no effect was found upon duplicating Area IV. However, 2×Area II had cooperative enhancer-like stimulation characteristics, with an activity level equivalent to Area I/Area II. Multimerized human Area II also stimulated transcription in a synergistic manner (data not shown). Together, these data revealed the distinct enhancer-like properties of Area II and further supported a central role in pdx-1 expression in the pancreas.

https://openalex.org/W1971425556,"Rho GTPases are key regulators of many cellular functions, including cytoskeleton organization which is important for cell morphology and mobility, gene expression, cell cycle progression, and cytokinesis. In addition, it has recently been recognized that Rho GTPase activity is required for development of the immune system, as well as for the specialized functions of the peripheral cells that act in the immune response such as antigen presenting cells and lymphocytes. Stimulation of T lymphocytes with interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces clonal expansion of antigen-specific populations and provides a model to study cell cycle entry and cell cycle progression. We have performed gene expression analysis in a model of human T lymphocytes, which proliferate in response to IL-2. In addition to changes in genes relevant to cell cycling and to the antiapoptotic effects of IL-2, we have analyzed expression and variations of more than 300 genes involved in Rho GTPase signaling pathways. We report here that IL-2 regulates the expression of a number of proteins, which participate in the Rho GTPase pathways, including some of the GTPases themselves, GDP/GTP exchange factors, GTPase activating proteins, as well as GDIs and effectors. Our results suggest that regulation of expression of components of the Rho GTPase pathways may be an important mechanism in assembling specific signal transduction cascades that need to be active at certain times during the cell cycle. Some of our findings may also be relevant to the roles of Rho GTPases in T lymphocyte functions and proliferation."

We have solved the solution structure of the heterodimer composed of the L27 domains from LIN-2 and LIN-7. Comparison of this structure with other L27 domain structures has allowed us to formulate a general model for why most L27 domains form an obligate heterodimer complex. L27 domains can be divided in two types (A and B), with each heterodimer comprising an A/B pair. We have identified two keystone positions that play a central role in discrimination. The residues at these positions are energetically acceptable in the context of an A/B heterodimer, but would lead to packing defects or electrostatic repulsion in the context of A/A and B/B homodimers. As predicted by the model, mutations of keystone residues stabilize normally strongly disfavored homodimers. Thus, L27 domains are specifically optimized to avoid homodimeric interactions. LIN-2/7 (L27) domains are protein interaction modules that preferentially hetero-oligomerize, a property critical for their function in directing specific assembly of supramolecular signaling complexes at synapses and other polarized cell-cell junctions.

As predicted by the model, mutations of keystone residues stabilize normally strongly disfavored homodimers. Thus, L27 domains are specifically optimized to avoid homodimeric interactions. Accurate transmission of cell signaling information often requires the proper co-assembly of partner proteins (1.Park S.H. Zarrinpar A. Lim W.A. Science. 2003; 299: 1061-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, many of these assembly interactions are mediated by modular protein-protein interaction domains. Because these modular domains often compose large families of domains, discrimination between related domains is critical; lack of specificity leads to promiscuous interactions and improper signaling (2.Zarrinpar A. Park S.H. Lim W.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to understand the molecular basis by which protein interaction domains recognize their correct partner but simultaneously discriminate against closely related but incorrect partners. Modular interaction domains play a central role in organizing polarized sites of cell-cell communication. At such sites of polarization, signaling proteins are organized into specific assemblies by scaffold proteins. The postsynaptic density in neurons (3.Kennedy M.B.

Cell. 1999; 96: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) are examples of highly organized signaling assembly coordinated by such scaffold proteins. In neurons and epithelial cells, PDZ (PSD95/DLG-1/ZO-1) domain-containing scaffold molecules play a central role in directing the trafficking and assembly of receptors and downstream effectors (7.Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, many of these PDZ domain-containing scaffold proteins have been found to interact with one another to form higher order supramolecular complexes (8.Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F.

Thus, L27 domains appear to play a central role in the higher order organization of multi-scaffold assemblies. Biochemical studies have revealed that known L27 domains are obligate hetero-oligomerization units (11.Harris B.Z. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Lim W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34902-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). L27 domains, which are ∼60 residues (28.Doerks T. Bork P. Kamberov E. Makarova O. Muecke S. Margolis B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 317-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), are largely unfolded in isolation, but fold to form a helical heterodimer upon interaction with the proper heterotypic partner (11.Harris B.Z. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Lim W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34902-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In some cases, two heterodimers can further oligomerize to form a higher order tetramer (29.Feng W. Long J.F. Fan J.S. Suetake T. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30.Li Y. Karnak D. Demeler B. Margolis B. Lavie A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31.Feng W. Long J.F. Zhang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6861-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, in all cases, all assemblies are built from the fundamental unit of a heterodimer. This core dimer unit displays an exclusive preference for heterodimerization versus homodimerization: typically, when only one L27 domain molecule is present, there is no evidence for folding into a homomer structure (11.Harris B.Z. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Lim W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34902-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The obligate heteromeric assembly of L27 domains is thought to be fundamental to its basic function of directing the formation of specific heteromeric supramolecular assemblies. The structures of several L27 domain-containing complexes have been reported (29.Feng W. Long J.F. Fan J.S. Suetake T. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Mol.

However, little is understood about how L27 domains bind tightly to their correct heterotypic partners while showing almost no self-association. Here, we report the solution structure of the heterodimer composed of the LIN-7 L27 domain and the C-terminal L27 domain from LIN-2 (referred to as LIN-2C). By comparing this and other L27 domain heterodimer structures, we have formulated a general model for why most L27 domains form obligate heterodimers. L27 domains can be divided in two types, referred to as A and B (29.Feng W. Long J.F. Fan J.S. Suetake T. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), with each heterodimer comprising an A/B pair. We have identified two keystone positions that play a central role in discrimination between heterodimer and homodimer formation. The residues at these positions are energetically acceptable in the context of an A/B heterodimer, but would be destabilizing in the context of a hypothetical A/A or B/B homodimer, leading to packing defects or electrostatic repulsion. As predicted by the model, mutation of these keystone positions increases the stability of the normally strongly disfavored homodimers. Thus, L27 domains are specifically optimized by negative design: they are simultaneously optimized to maximize heterotypic complementarity and to avoid homotypic interactions. Cloning and Expression of Linked L27 Domains—DNA regions encoding L27 domains were amplified by PCR (11.Harris B.Z. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Lim W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34902-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The regions cloned comprised C. elegans LIN-7A amino acids 115-180 (referred to as LIN-7) and H. sapiens LIN-2 amino acids 394-460 (referred to as LIN-2C). The mixed species LIN-7/LIN-2C pair (C. elegans/Homo sapiens) was previously shown to be particularly stable (11.Harris B.Z. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Lim W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34902-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and best suited for structural analysis. L27 domains from LIN-7 and LIN-2C were expressed as a linked construct to ensure a 1:1 ratio and to improve solubility, a technique previously used to express the SAP97/LIN-2N L27 domain pair (29.Feng W. Long J.F. Fan J.S. Suetake T. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PCR primers where used to engineer a Gly-Ser linker between the two L27 domains. The coding fragments were ligated into the expression vector pBH4, which provided an N-terminal His6 tag for purification. All constructs were verified by sequencing on both strands. The LIN-7 L27 domain construct has been described previously (11.Harris B.Z. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Lim W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34902-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Keystone residues were mutated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. Protein constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 pLysS (Invitrogen). Cultures were grown in standard Luria broth at 32 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 nm ∼ 0.8. To obtain labeled protein constructs (15N, 13C, and 13C,15N; 70% deuterated) for NMR analysis, cultures were transferred to M9 minimal medium containing labeled 15NH4Cl and/or [13C6]glucose before induction. Unlabeled protein constructs were harvested by centrifugation after 3 h of growth, whereas labeled protein constructs were harvested after 5 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in ∼25 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 400 mm NaCl) per original liter of culture and subjected to freeze-thaw treatment. Cell suspensions were lysed by sonication and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Wild-type and mutant constructs were expressed at similar levels. The His6 tag-containing proteins were purified under native conditions by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen Inc.). For NMR analysis, purified protein was dialyzed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride for constructs containing cysteines, concentrated, and stored at -80 °C until used. For CD experiments, protein was stored in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride for constructs containing cysteines. NMR Structure Determination and Analysis—NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on Bruker DRX500, DMX600, and Avance 700 spectrometers equipped with conventional 1H{13C/15N} triple resonance probes and on Bruker DRX600, Avance800, and Avance900 spectrometers equipped with cryogenic 1H{13C/15N} probes. Samples contained 2 mm protein in 90% H2O and 10% D2O with 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, 0.05% 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid, and 0.05% sodium azide. Signal dispersion of the constructs was verified with 15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) spectra. Sequential backbone assignments were derived from transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)-type three-dimensional heteronuclear correlation experiments, including HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HN(CO)CACB, and HNCACB (32.Salzmann M.W.G.

Side chains were assigned through a combination of total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY)-[15N,1H]-TROSY, (H)CC(CO)NH and HCC(CO)NH spectra (32.Salzmann M.W.G. Pervushin K. Senn H. Wuthrich K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 844-848Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Distance constraints were derived from nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy (NOESY)-[15N,1H]-TROSY, two types of NOESY-[13C,1H]-HSQC experiments optimized for CH3 groups and aliphatic CH/CH2 groups and a constant time NOESY-[13C,1H]-TROSY with mixing times ranging 70 to 120 ms (32.Salzmann M.W.G. Pervushin K. Senn H. Wuthrich K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 844-848Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Spectra were processed using XWIN-NMR (Bruker BioSpin Corp.) and analyzed using XEASY (34.Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were derived from N, HN, C-α, and C-β chemical shifts with the program TALOS (35.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Structures were iteratively refined using the simulated annealing protocol of the torsion angle dynamics program DYANA (36.Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Nuclear Overhauser effect peak intensities were converted into upper distance bounds with the CALIBA function of DYANA. Of the final 100 structures calculated, the 10 conformers with the lowest target function values were selected for analysis. These structures were averaged, and the resulting structure was minimized in CNS (37.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

The resulting 10 best structures were assessed for overall quality using PROCHECK (see Fig. 2) (38.Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

A, L27 domain sequences cluster into A- and B-type domains by sequence homology; B, sequence alignment of A- and B-type domains. We have identified two differentiating “keystone” positions. At the “electrostatic” keystone position, A-type domains generally have a positively charged residue (+), whereas B-type domains have a negatively charged residue (-). A subclass of A-type domains (SAP97 family members) have a neutral residue (N), the implications of which are reviewed under “Discussion.” At the “hydrophobic/polar” keystone position, A-type domains have a conserved hydrophobic residue (H), which is polar in the B-type domains (P).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Circular Dichroism—CD spectroscopy was performed on a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter. All scans were performed in a 1-cm quartz cuvette in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride for constructs containing cysteines. The CD spectra shown are the averages of two experiments. Data for wavelength scans were collected at 1-nm intervals with 1-s averaging time/data point and a total of 10 repetitions/scan. Data for guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denaturation studies were collected at 222 nm with 0.1 m denaturant intervals and with 60-s averaging time/data point and 60-s equilibration time/data point. Identical results were obtained with the wild-type protein for longer equilibration times (data not shown). Both orientations of linked domains were found to behave identically in denaturant melts (data not shown). The midpoint of the unfolding transition is concentration-independent above 4 μm for the wild-type construct (data not shown). For all experiments, the total L27 domain concentration was 10 μm (10 μm monomers and 5 μm linked heterodimer). Structure of the LIN-7/LIN-2C L27 Domain Heterodimer—The structure of the LIN-7/LIN-2C heterodimer was solved by NMR as shown in Fig. 2. The two domains are expressed in a single covalently linked protein that yields improved expression and provides a 1:1 stoichiometry while not perturbing the structure of the complex (31.Feng W. Long J.F. Zhang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6861-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The unlinked LIN-7·LIN-2C complex was previously shown to exist primarily as a dimer (11.Harris B.Z. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Lim W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34902-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When covalently linked, the apparent molecular mass of the complex doubles (data not shown), consistent with formation of a tetramer at NMR and CD concentrations. A similar tetramer structure has recently been reported for a LIN-7·LIN-2C complex from mouse (31.Feng W. Long J.F. Zhang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6861-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The tetramer interface is discussed elsewhere in great detail (29.Feng W. Long J.F. Fan J.S. Suetake T. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31.Feng W. Long J.F. Zhang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6861-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); here, we focused primarily on the interaction specificity within the core heterodimer unit. The structure of the core heterodimer is similar to those of the previously solved L27 domain heterodimers, those involving SAP97/LIN-2N (29.Feng W. Long J.F. Fan J.S. Suetake T. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and PATJ/PALS1N (30.Li Y. Karnak D. Demeler B. Margolis B. Lavie A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). (LIN-2 and PALS1 scaffold proteins each contain two L27 domains; the “N” indicates that these structures contain the N-terminal L27 domain.) Each individual monomer contains three α-helices, with the first two helices from each monomer packing together to form a four-helix bundle that forms the core of the dimer. The third helices from the two monomers pack against one another and the bottom of the helical bundle, capping the hydrophobic core presented by the bundle. The overall heterodimer structure buries a surface area of 2159 Å2, 69% of which is due to the packing interface of the central four-helix bundle. L27 Domains Fall into Two Distinct Sequence Types—When aligned, all known L27 domain sequences segregate into two distinct types, referred to as A and B (29.Feng W. Long J.F. Fan J.S. Suetake T. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The clustering of these two types is shown in a dendrogram and by sequence alignment in Fig. 3 (A and B). Strikingly, each pair of known interacting L27 domains involves the interaction of an A-type monomer with a B-type monomer (10.Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D. Straight S. Margolis B.

Not only are most monomers unable to self-associate, but they are also unable to interact with distinct monomers from within the same type (11.Harris B.Z. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Lim W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34902-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12.Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46730-46735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the case of the LIN-7/LIN-2C heterodimer studied here, LIN-7 is the A-type monomer, whereas LIN-2C is a B-type monomer. Conserved Structural Asymmetry in L27 Domain Dimers—A comparison of the three known L27 domain dimer structures is shown in Fig. 4A. These structures align well (LIN-7/LIN-2C versus PATJ/PALS1N root mean square deviation (C-α) = 2.17 Å and LIN-7/LIN-2C versus SAP97/LIN-2N root mean square deviation (C-α) = 3.45 Å) only when the same monomer subtypes are aligned (Fig. 4B). The other chains in the tetramer structures are similarly aligned. Careful examination revealed that there are distinct asymmetries between the A- and B-type monomer structures that are conserved across all known structures (31.Feng W. Long J.F. Zhang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6861-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Several key asymmetric features are highlighted in the contact maps shown in Fig. 4B. For the individual monomer units, in the B-type monomer, helix B1 and B3 come into close contact, whereas in the A-type monomer, helix A1 and A3 do not. In the dimer structure, helix B3 comes within 6 Å of helix A2, whereas helix A3 does not come closer than 10 Å to helix B2. These asymmetries can be understood by examining the overall dimer structure (Fig. 4A). Although helices A3 and B3 function together to cap the bottom end of the central four-helix bundle, helix B3 packs directly against the base of the bundle. In contrast, helix A3 primarily packs against helix B3. Keystone Positions: Potential Determinants of A- and B-type Monomer Structural Identity—The well conserved structural asymmetry between A- and B-type monomers in three different L27 domain dimer structures suggests that there is a fundamental difference in monomer sequence that results in these clear structural differences. Thus, we carefully examined the sequences of A and B subtypes for potential keystone positions that are distinct in each type. Two strong candidate positions emerged. First, the third residue in helix 2 has distinct electrostatic properties; in A-type monomers, this residue is either positively charged or neutral, whereas in B-type monomers, it is almost always negatively charged. Additionally, the second residue in helix 3 has distinct hydrophobic versus polar character; in A-type monomers, this position is always a large hydrophobic residue, whereas in B-type monomers, it is a polar residue. These potential keystone positions are highlighted in the alignment shown in Fig. 3B. In the following two sections, we examine how these two keystone positions might contribute to preferential heterodimerization. The Hydrophobic/Polar Keystone Position—The second residue in helix 3 is generally a large hydrophobic residue (Phe, Leu, or Met) in A-type L27 domains, whereas it is almost always a polar residue (His, Asp, or Ser) in B-type L27 domains (Fig. 3). Examination of L27 domain dimer structures revealed that this position is at the center of the conserved structural asymmetry. Helix A3 adopts a different orientation compared with helix B3 with respect to the main four-helix bundle. Because of this different orientation, as shown in Fig. 5A, the second residue in helix A3 (e.g. Phe41 in LIN-7) points into the core of the protein, whereas the second residue in helix B3 (e.g. His39 in LIN-2C) points toward the solvent. Thus, a possible model is that, to satisfy packing and hydrophobicity requirements, this position must be a hydrophobic residue in the A-type monomer,"
https://openalex.org/W2142208489,"The type 1 sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) G protein-coupled receptor (S1P1) transduces signals from S1P that mediate thymocyte emigration, T cell transmigration of lymph nodes, and T cell chemotaxis in tissues. Alterations in expression of functional S1P1 receptors by lymphocytes are the major mechanisms controlling their responses to S1P and were thought to be solely a consequence of the balance between surface down-regulation and insertion. However, results now show that lack of sulfation of tyrosines 19 and 22 of the extracellular N terminus of S1P1 diminishes high-affinity S1P binding and decreases S1P signaling of T cell migration and other functions. Non-sulfatable mutant (Y19,22F)S1P1 endows T cells with lower-affinity binding of [32P]S1P than wild-type S1P1 and transduces lesser effects of S1P on chemotaxis, chemokine-elicited chemotaxis, and T cell receptor-mediated proliferation and cytokine generation. Inhibition of S1P1 tyrosine sulfation or sulfatase removal of S1P1 sulfate in mouse CD4 T cells suppresses immune functional effects of S1P. Tyrosine sulfation of S1P1 may be a major controller of S1P effects on T cell traffic."

Consistent with its central role in Friend murine leukemia virus-induced erythroleukemia, enforced expression of FLI-1 in primary erythroblasts and erythroleukemic cell lines has been shown to strongly interfere with the normal, erythropoietin-induced differentiation of these cells (8Tamir A.

Other studies show that FLI-1 might also contribute to the transformed phenotype through interference with the expression of genes important to erythroblast differentiation (8Tamir A. Howard J.

FLI-1 is rearranged in Ewing sarcoma (a childhood pediatric tumor of neuroectodermal origin) as a result of a t(11;22)(q24; q12) chromosomal translocation that fuses the 5′-end of the EWS gene to the 3′-end of FLI-1 and the expression of a chimeric EWS-FLI-1 protein endowed with abnormal transcriptional regulatory properties and transforming activity (for review, see Ref. 15Arvand A. Welford S.M. Teitell M.A. Denny C.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5311-5317PubMed Google Scholar). PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT proteins) and PIAS3 have been identified as inhibitors of the cytokine receptor/JAK (Janus kinase)-induced activation of STAT1- and STAT3-DNA binding, respectively. In mammals, the PIAS family also includes PIASxα, PIASxβ, and PIASy. PIAS proteins share three conserved domains: an N-terminal SAP (SAF/Acinus/PIAS) domain, a central RING finger-like domain, and a C-terminal serine/acidic residue-rich domain. The SAP domain binds AT-rich DNA sequences known as the scaffold or nuclear matrix attachment region, involved in the topological organization of chromatin and in the regulation of gene expression (for review, see Ref. 16Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Pockwinse S.M. McNeil S. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 30-31: 220-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RING finger-like domain of PIAS proteins is instrumental in their ability to function as SUMO E3 ligases that favor the covalent modification of a variety of target proteins by the three known members of the SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) family (for review, see Ref. 17Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Sumoylation is a three-step process similar to protein ubiquitinylation, involving a SUMO-activating enzyme (E1; AOS1/UBA2); a SUMO carrier protein (E2; Ubc9); and E3 ligases, including Ran-binding protein-2, Polycomb-2, and PIAS proteins. Sumoylation regulates a number of protein-protein interactions involved in critical cellular functions, including protein stability, nuclear import, transcriptional regulation, biogenesis of subnuclear bodies, and chromosome structure. As the functional regulators of FLI-1 are largely unknown, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify novel FLI-1 interactors. We identified PIASxα/ARIP3 as a new partner and co-regulator of FLI-1. ARIP3 was found to interact physically with FLI-1, to repress its transcriptional activity, and to sequester it into PIASxα/ARIP3 nuclear bodies. FLI-1 is sumoylated at a single lysine residue in its transcriptional activation domain, and ARIP3 is shown to be a SUMO E3 ligase for FLI-1 in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, the repressive properties of ARIP3 are not dependent upon its SUMO ligase activity and FLI-1 sumoylation, but critically depend upon its ability to physically complex FLI-1 into a transcriptionally inactive protein complex. Reagents—Anti-FLI-1 (catalog no. sc-356) and anti-ERK2 (catalog no. sc-154) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-FLAG antibody (catalog no.

Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The DNA fragment encoding FLI-1-(225-373) was subcloned in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain in the BTM116 vector to produce the bait for yeast two-hybrid studies. A human bone marrow cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD) was from Clontech. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (19Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar), and a total of 5 × 106 transformants were screened. Positive clones were selected on plates lacking uracil, histidine, tryptophan, lysine, and leucine, followed by β-galactosidase assays, and verified by one-on-one transformation assays. DNA Constructs—To obtain the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FLI-1-(3-208), GST-FLI-1-(3-286), GST-FLI-1-(188-452), and GST-FLI-1-(250-452) fusion proteins, the corresponding regions were PCR-amplified from the human FLI-1 cDNA using pBS-wtFLI-1 (13Ano S.

This resulted in flanking the PCR-amplified fragment either with a SalI restriction site for FLI-1-(3-208) and FLI-1-(3-286) or with BamHI and SalI for the fragments encoding FLI-1-(188-452) and FLI-1-(250-452) at their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The respective SalI- or BamHI/SalI-digested PCR fragments were inserted in SalI- or BamHI/SalI-cut pGEX-4T. To generate pBS-HA-wtFLI-1, ΔEB-HA-FLI-1 (20Bailly R.A. Bosselut R. Zucman J. Cormier F.

Mutants FLI-1(K67R) and FLI-1(K217R) were generated by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions using pBS-HA-wtFLI-1 as a matrix and mutagenic primers 5′-GGG TCA ACG TCA GGC GGG AGT ATG ACC-3′/5′-GGT CAT ACT CCC GCC TGA CGT TGA CCC-3′ and 5′-CCT CAC GAT TGA GTG TCA GAG AAG ACC CTT CTT ATG AC-3′/5′-GTC ATA AGA AGG GTC TTC TCT GAC ACT CAA TCG TGA GG-3′, respectively. The double point mutant FLI-1(K67R,K217R) was generated using pBS-HA-FLI-1(K67R) as a matrix and the mutagenic primers used for FLI-1(K217R). To generate HA-tagged versions of these mutants in the corresponding ΔEB expression vector derivatives, mutagenized FLI-1 inserts were retrieved by XhoI/HindIII digestion and ligated into XhoI/HindIII-restricted ΔEB-HA (21Rabault B. Ghysdael J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28143-28151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vectors pSG5-His-SUMO-1 and pSG5-His-HA-SUMO-2 (22Muller S. Berger M. Lehembre F.

To generate pTag2A-ARIP3-(Δ13-28), pTag2A-ARIP3-(Δ198-337), and pTag2A-ARIP3-(Δ346-475), the SmaI/BglII cDNA inserts from the respective pFLAG vectors were subcloned into EcoRV/BamHI-restricted pTag2A (Stratagene). The ΔEB expression plasmids encoding HA-wtFLI-1, HA-FLI-1-(276-373), tkD2A-luciferase (Luc), and mouse (m) FLI-1-(-270/-41)-Luc have been described previously (12Lesault I. Quang C.T. Frampton J.

Using ΔEB-HA-wtFLI-1 as a template, the FLI-1 DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 273-452 was amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-GCC TCG AGG CCT GGA AGC GGG CAG ATC C-3′ (containing a 5′-XhoI site) and 5′-CCA AGC TTC TAG TAG TAG CTG CC-3′ (containing a 3′-HindIII site). The amplified DNA fragment was digested with XhoI and HindIII and ligated in-frame into XhoI/HindIII-digested ΔEB-HA to generate ΔEB-HA-FLI-1-(273-452). pSG513-3×HA-BirA was a kind gift from Dr. T. B. van Dijk (Erasmus Medical Center). pcDNA3-biopeptide-FLI-1(M34A) was generated as follows. An oligonucleotide encoding the biopeptide (MASSMRQILDSQKMEWRSNAGGS), 5′-CCG ATA TCC CAC CAT GGC CTC TTC CCT GAG ACA GAT CCT CGA CAG CCA GAA GAT GGA GTG GCG CTC CAA CGC AGG AGG CTC TAG ATC TCC C-3′, was used as a PCR template with 5′-CCC GAT ATC CCA CCA TGG-3′ (containing a 5′-EcoRV site) and 5′-GGG AGA TCT AGA GCC TCC-3′ (containing a 3′-BglII site) as primers, and the PCR product was ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO, generating pCR2.1-TOPO-biopeptide. pCR2.1-TOPO-biopeptide was digested with EcoRV and BglII, and the fragment was ligated into EcoRV/BglII-digested pBS-HA-FLI-1, replacing, in-frame, the HA tag with the biopeptide tag. wtFLI-1 contains an alternative translation initiation codon at position 34. To prevent alternative translation from AUG at position 34, this codon was mutated into an alanine codon using a site-directed mutagenesis kit and primers 5′-GGA CTC CCC GAG GCA GTC GCG TCG GCC TTG GGG AGA TGG-3′ and 5′-CCA TCA CCC CAA GGC CGA CGC GAC TGC CTC GGG GAG TCC-3′. Biopeptide-FLI-1(M34A) was released from the pBS vector by digestion with HindIII and ligated into HindIII-digested pcDNA3 to generate pcDNA3-biopeptide-tagged FLI-1(M34A), referred to as biotagged FLI-1 under “Results.” HA-ARIP3 was made as follows. Using FLAG-ARIP3 as a template, wtarip3 cDNA was amplified and fused N-terminally to an HA epitope by PCR with primers 5′-GGA GAT CTG CAA CCA TGT ACC CAT ACG ATG TTC CAG ATT ACG CGG CGG ATT TCG AGG AGT TGA GG-3′ (containing a 5′-BglII site, followed by the cDNA encoding the HA epitope fused in-frame to the first 20 nucleotides of wtARIP3) and 5′-CGG AAT TCT CAC TGT TGC ACA GTA TCA GA-3′ (containing a 3′-EcoRI site). The PCR product was cut with BglII and EcoRI and ligated into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pcDNA3, yielding pcDNA3-HA-wtARIP3. Affinity Chromatography of Biotinylated Proteins and Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—293 cells (1.0 × 106) were seeded in 60-mm2 Petri dishes 24 h prior to transfection, and DNA was transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (25van den Akker E. van Dijk T.B. Parren-van Amelsvoort M.P. Grossmann K.S. Schaeper U. Toney-Earley K. Waltz S.E. Lowenberg B. von Lindern M. Blood. 2004; 103: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 50 nm NaF, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science), 50 mg/ml aprotinin, 50 mg/ml leupeptin, 50 mg/ml bacitracin, and 50 mg/ml iodoacetamide) on ice for 10 min, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until used. Lysates were thawed on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated for 1 h with 1 μg of a specific IgG as indicated in the legends, followed by a 1-h incubation with 15 μl of 50% protein A-agarose bead slurry (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, followed by one washing step with ice-cold PBS and boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. For affinity chromatography of biotinylated FLI-1, lysates were incubated for 1 h with 10 μl of magnetic polystyrene beads covalently coupled to streptavidin (Dynabeads M-280; 50% slurry washed three times and reconstituted in ice-cold lysis buffer). Magnetic beads were washed three times as described above for immunoprecipitation assays, except that a magnet (catalog no. Z5342, Promega Corp.) was used for fast recovery of the beads. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (26van Dijk T.B. van den Akker E. Amelsvoort M.P. Mano H. Lowenberg B. von Lindern M. Blood. 2000; 96: 3406-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were stripped in 63 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.1), 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C, after which they were reused. When appropriate, fluorescence was detected using GeneSnap Version 6.01 (SYNGENE, Cambridge, UH) and quantified with GeneTools software (SYNGENE). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop Version 6.0. Luciferase Assays and Immunofluorescence Analyses—For transactivation experiments, 3 × 105 HeLa or 293 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) were plated in six-well plates and transfected 24 h later with the indicated amount of plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate coprecipitation of DNA as described above. The total amount of expression plasmid was kept constant by addition of the corresponding empty vector without insert, and the total amount of DNA (20 μg/500 μl) was kept constant by addition of carrier plasmid DNA. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system kit (Promega). The results shown are the mean of at least three independent transfection experiments. For immunofluorescence analyses, 1.5 × 105 293 cells were seeded per well in 12-well plates containing 14-mm2 glass coverslips (Marienfeld MultiMedia GmbH, Essen, Germany). After 24 h, cells were transfected with 1 μg of ΔEB-HA-FLI-1 and 1.5 μg of pFLAG-ARIP3 and mutants derived thereof as indicated using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. The total amount of expression plasmid was kept constant by addition of the corresponding empty vector without insert, and the total amount of DNA (20 μg/500 μl) was kept constant by addition of carrier plasmid DNA. 2 days after transfection, the cells were washed two times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (15 min), and permeabilized by incubation in 0.3% Triton X-100 (15 min). After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with a 1:200 dilution of anti-FLI-1 antibody and a 1:100 dilution of anti-FLAG antibody in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:100 dilution), Texas Red-coupled donkey anti-mouse antibody (1:100 dilution), and 50 μg/ml Hoechst dye (all obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum. Coverslips were washed two times with PBS and mounted in Dabco. Pictures of fixed cells were collected using a three-dimensional deconvolution imaging system. In brief, a Leica DM RXA microscope equipped with a piezoelectric translator (PIFOC, Physik Instrumente L. P.) placed at the base of a ×100 PlanApo numerical aperture 1.4 objective and a 5-MHz Micromax 1300Y interline CCD camera (Roper Instruments) was used. Stacks of conventional fluorescent images were collected automatically at 0.2-μm z-intervals (MetaMorph software, Universal Imaging Corp.). Wavelength selection was achieved by switching to the corresponding motorized selective Leica filter block before each stack acquisition. Automated batch deconvolution of each z-series was computed using a measured point spread function with a custom-made software package (J. B. Sibarita, Institut Curie). DNA Binding by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and Oligonucleotide Pull-down Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described previously (20Bailly R.A. Bosselut R. Zucman J. Cormier F. Delattre O. Roussel M. Thomas G. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For the oligonucleotide pull-down assay, a double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to a high affinity FLI-1-binding site (wild-type, 5′-TCG GGT CGA CAT AAC CGG AAG TGG GC-3′ ((+)-strand), with the EBS core sequence underlined) was synthesized as a 5′-biotinylated derivative. A version of this oligonucleotide mutated in the EBS core (5′-TCG GGT CGA CAT AAC CCC AAG TGG GC-3′ ((+)-strand), with the mutations shown in boldface) was used a negative control. The oligonucleotides were immobilized on streptavidin beads by overnight incubation at 4 °C in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 6mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/μl poly(dI·dC)) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin at a final ratio of 0.6 μg of oligonucleotide/1 × 106 beads. After three washes, the EBS oligonucleotide-streptavidin beads were equilibrated in binding buffer. The efficiency of oligonucleotide loading onto the streptavidin beads was checked in a small aliquot by detaching the EBS from the beads by incubation at 90 °C in 0.1% SDS and resolving the extract on a 1.5% agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide. Whole cell extracts were obtained (100-mm2 Petri dish in 300 μl of lysis buffer) from 293 cells transfected with the expression vector for HA-FLI-1 (1 μg) with or without the expression vector for HA-ARIP3 (1 μg) or empty vector as a control. Lysates (100 μl) were diluted with 2 volumes of binding buffer, keeping poly(dI·dC) constant at 10 μg/μl, and incubated with 7 × 106 oligonucleotide-immobilized beads for 60 min at 4 °C. The DNA affinity matrix was washed three times with binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Boiled extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In Vitro and in Vivo SUMO Conjugation—In vitro sumoylation assays performed with 2 μl of in vitro translated wtFLI-1 protein in reticulocyte lysate (Promega) were performed as described previously (27Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S. Miska E. Mathieu M. Harel-Bellan A. Kouzarides T. Melchior F. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2682-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To detect sumoylated FLI-1 in vivo, 0.5 × 106 HeLa cells were seeded in 60-mm2 Petri dishes and transfected 24 h later with ΔEB-HA-FLI-1 along with pSG5-His-SUMO-1 or pSG5-His-HA-SUMO-2 as indicated. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of 6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 50 μl of lysate was precipitated with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid for 2 h at room temperature. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, the trichloroacetic acid protein precipitates were rinsed two times with acetone, air-dried, resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To detect ARIP3-mediated FLI-1 sumoylation in vivo, 0.5 × 106 293 were seeded in 60-mm2 cells Petri dishes and transfected with ΔEB-HA-wtFLI-1 together with pSG5-His-SUMO-1 and/or pFLAG-wtARIP3 when appropriate. After 48 h, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed directly in 200 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Lysates were sonicated for 20 s on ice at low intensity to fragment genomic DNA, and 20 μl was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Isolation of the SUMO Ligase PIASxα as a Binding Partner of FLI-1 in a Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—In a search for potential partners of FLI-1, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human bone marrow cDNA library was performed using, as bait, a fusion between the LexA DNA-binding domain and amino acids 225-373 of FLI-1 (LexA-FLI-1-(225-373)). This region includes a domain unique to the FLI-1/ERG subfamily of ETS proteins (residues 257-276) as well as the entire ETS domain (Fig. 1A). Three interactors involved in the post-translational modification of proteins by SUMO, including SUMO-1 itself, Ubc9, and PIASxα, were identified as positive clones in this screen. These interactions were specific because coexpression of LexA-FLI-1-(225-373) with Gal4AD-PIASxα, Gal4AD-SUMO-1, or Gal4AD-Ubc9 activated the lacZ reporter present in the indicator yeast strain, whereas the control LexA-MST3 bait failed to interact with any of these Gal4AD fusion proteins (Fig. 1B). Of note, LexA-FLI-1-(225-373) did not auto-activate the lacZ reporter (data not shown). To analyze whether FLI-1 and PIASxα interact in vivo, 293 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding a FLAG-tagged version of rat PIASxα (also known as ARIP3) (18Moilanen A.M.
