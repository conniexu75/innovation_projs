https://openalex.org/W4213362500,"Game animals are wildlife species traded and consumed as food and are potential reservoirs for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We performed a meta-transcriptomic analysis of 1,941 game animals, representing 18 species and five mammalian orders, sampled across China. From this, we identified 102 mammalian-infecting viruses, with 65 described for the first time. Twenty-one viruses were considered as potentially high risk to humans and domestic animals. Civets (Paguma larvata) carried the highest number of potentially high-risk viruses. We inferred the transmission of bat-associated coronavirus from bats to civets, as well as cross-species jumps of coronaviruses from bats to hedgehogs, from birds to porcupines, and from dogs to raccoon dogs. Of note, we identified avian Influenza A virus H9N2 in civets and Asian badgers, with the latter displaying respiratory symptoms, as well as cases of likely human-to-wildlife virus transmission. These data highlight the importance of game animals as potential drivers of disease emergence."

Here we report that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accesses skull bone marrow via dura-skull channels, and CSF proteins signal onto diverse cell types within the niches. After spinal cord injury, CSF-borne cues promote myelopoiesis and egress of myeloid cells into meninges. This reveals a mechanism of CNS-to-bone-marrow communication via CSF that regulates CNS immune responses."

On one hand, we carefully annotate a large set of tweets for hate speech, and deploy advanced deep learning to produce high quality hate speech classification models. On the other hand, we create retweet networks, detect communities and monitor their evolution through time. This combined approach is applied to three years of Slovenian Twitter data. We report a number of interesting results. Hate speech is dominated by offensive tweets, related to political and ideological issues. The share of unacceptable tweets is moderately increasing with time, from the initial 20% to 30% by the end of 2020. Unacceptable tweets are retweeted significantly more often than acceptable tweets. About 60% of unacceptable tweets are produced by a single right-wing community of only moderate size. Institutional Twitter accounts and media accounts post significantly less unacceptable tweets than individual accounts. In fact, the main sources of unacceptable tweets are anonymous accounts, and accounts that were suspended or closed during the years 2018–2020."

We used a random-effect meta-analysis technique to estimate the pooled mean for CP100K. We also used negative binomial regression with CP100K as the dependent variable and the human development index (HDI) and the type of vaccine used as independent variables.The pooled estimated mean CP100K was 4970 (95% CI 4030 to 5900) cases per 100,000 population for countries using IPV, significantly (p<0.001) higher than that for countries using OPV-1580 (1190 to 1960). Countries with higher HDI prefer to use IPV; those with lower HDI commonly use OPV. Both HDI and the type of vaccine were independent predictors of CP100K. Use of OPV compared to IPV could independently decrease the CP100K by an average of 30% at the mean HDI of 0.72.Countries using OPV have a lower incidence of COVID-19 compared to those using IPV. This might suggest that OPV may either prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection at individual level or slow down the transmission at the community level."

The present research aimed to identify the natural inhibitors of HPV-18 E1 protein (1R9W) from Himalayan herbs with lesser toxicity and higher potency. In this study, one hundred nineteen phytoconstituents of twenty important traditional medicinal plants of Northwest Himalayas were selected for molecular docking with the target protein 1R9W of HPV-18 E1 Molecular docking was performed by AutoDock vina software. ADME/T screening of the bioactive phytoconstituents was done by SwissADME, admetSAR, and Protox II. A couple of best protein-ligand complexes were selected for 100 ns MD simulation. Molecular docking results revealed that among all the selected phytoconstituents only thirty-five phytoconstituents showed the binding affinity similar or more than the standard anti-cancer drugs viz. imiquimod (-6.1 kJ/mol) and podofilox (-6.9 kJ/mol). Among all the selected thirty-five phytoconstituents, eriodictyol-7-glucuronide, stigmasterol, clicoemodin and thalirugidine showed the best interactions with a docking score of -9.1, -8.7, -8.4, and -8.4 kJ/mol. Based on the ADME screening, only two phytoconstituents namely stigmasterol and clicoemodin selected as the best inhibitor of HPV protein. MD simulation study also revealed that stigmasterol and clicoemodin were stable inside the binding pocket of 1R9W, Stigmasterol and clicoemodin can be used as a potential investigational drug to cure HPV infections."
https://openalex.org/W4221023669,"Food animals are known reservoirs of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli, but information regarding the factors influencing colonization by these organisms is lacking. Here we report the genomic analysis of 66 MDR E. coli isolates from non-redundant veal calf fecal samples. Genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, β-lactams, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines were the most frequent antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) detected and included those that confer resistance to clinically significant antibiotics (blaCMY-2, blaCTX-M, mph(A), erm(B), aac(6')Ib-cr, and qnrS1). Co-occurrence analyses indicated that multiple ARGs significantly co-occurred with each other, and with metal and biocide resistance genes (MRGs and BRGs). Genomic analysis also indicated that the MDR E. coli isolated from veal calves were highly diverse. The most frequently detected genotype was phylogroup A-ST Cplx 10. A high percentage of isolates (50%) were identified as sequence types that are the causative agents of extra-intestinal infections (ExPECs), such as ST69, ST410, ST117, ST88, ST617, ST648, ST10, ST58, and ST167, and an appreciable number of these isolates encoded virulence factors involved in the colonization and infection of the human urinary tract. There was a significant difference in the presence of multiple accessory virulence factors (VFs) between MDR and susceptible strains. VFs associated with enterohemorrhagic infections, such as stx, tir, and eae, were more likely to be harbored by antimicrobial-susceptible strains, while factors associated with extraintestinal infections such as the sit system, aerobactin, and pap fimbriae genes were more likely to be encoded in resistant strains. A comparative analysis of SNPs between strains indicated that several closely related strains were recovered from animals on different farms indicating the potential for resistant strains to circulate among farms. These results indicate that veal calves are a reservoir for a diverse group of MDR E. coli that harbor various resistance genes and virulence factors associated with human infections. Evidence of co-occurrence of ARGs with MRGs, BRGs, and iron-scavenging genes (sit and aerobactin) may lead to management strategies for reducing colonization of resistant bacteria in the calf gut."
https://openalex.org/W4220837256,"Owing to the avascular environment within ovarian follicles, granulosa cells (GCs) are believed to live in a hypoxic niche. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-mediated steroidogenesis is crucial for normal growth and maturation of ovarian follicles, but it remains unclear how FSH stimulates estradiol (E2) synthesis under hypoxic conditions. Here, we aimed to explore whether FSH affects the ATP production required for estrogen synthesis from the perspective of glucose metabolism. It was observed that the levels of both E2 and HIF-1α were markedly increased in a dose-dependent manner in mouse ovarian GCs after the injection of FSH in vivo, indicating that hypoxia/HIF-1α may be relevant to FSH-induced E2 synthesis. By treating hypoxic GCs with FSH in vitro, we further revealed that the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-GLUT1 pathway, which in turn stimulates ATP generation, may be essential for FSH-mediated E2 production during hypoxia. In contrast, inhibition of AMPK or GLUT1 with siRNAs/antagonist both repressed glycolysis, ATP production, and E2 synthesis despite FSH treatment. Moreover, blocking HIF-1α activity using siRNAs/PX-478 suppressed AMPK activation, GLUT1 expression, and E2 levels in FSH-treated GCs. Finally, the in vitro findings were verified in vivo, which showed markedly increased AMPK activity, GLUT1 expression, glycolytic flux, ATP levels, and E2 concentrations in ovarian GCs following FSH injection. Taken together, these findings uncovered a novel mechanism for FSH-regulating E2 synthesis in hypoxic GCs by activating glycolytic metabolism through the HIF-1α-AMPK-GLUT1 pathway."

Across FYs, a positive C-SSRS screen was associated with increased probability of mental health follow-up and treatment engagement. Patients who were not seen in mental health in the year prior to screening had the greatest increase in probability of mental health follow-up and engagement following a positive screen (P<0.001). For FY19, a positive C-SSRS screen in non-mental health connected patients was associated with an increased probability of follow-up from 49.8% to 79.5% (relative risk = 1.60) and engagement from 39.5% to 63.6% (relative risk = 1.61). For mental health-connected patients, a positive C-SSRS screen was associated with a smaller increase in probability of follow-up from 75.8% to 87.6% (relative risk = 1.16) and engagement from 63.3% to 76.4% (relative risk = 1.21). Results for FY20 were similar.Identification of suicide risk through population-level screening was associated with increased mental health follow-up and engagement, particularly for non-mental health connected patients. Findings support the use of a standardized, comprehensive suicide risk screening program for managing elevated suicide risk in a large healthcare system."

https://openalex.org/W4220768988,"Cell-free protein synthesis systems (CFPS) utilize cellular transcription and translation (TX-TL) machinery to synthesize proteins in vitro. These systems are useful for multiple applications including production of difficult proteins, as high-throughput tools for genetic circuit screening, and as systems for biosensor development. Though rapidly evolving, CFPS suffer from some disadvantages such as limited reaction rates due to longer diffusion times, significant cost per assay when using commercially sourced materials, and reduced reagent stability over prolonged periods. To address some of these challenges, we conducted a series of proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate enhancement of CFPS productivity via nanoparticle assembly driven nanoaggregation of its constituent proteins. We combined a commercially available CFPS that utilizes purified polyhistidine-tagged (His-tag) TX-TL machinery with CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell quantum dots (QDs) known to readily coordinate His-tagged proteins in an oriented fashion. We show that nanoparticle scaffolding of the CFPS cross-links the QDs into nanoaggregate structures while enhancing the production of functional recombinant super-folder green fluorescent protein and phosphotriesterase, an organophosphate hydrolase; the latter by up to 12-fold. This enhancement, which occurs by an undetermined mechanism, has the potential to improve CFPS in general and specifically CFPS-based biosensors (faster response time) while also enabling rapid detoxification/bioremediation through point-of-concern synthesis of similar catalytic enzymes. We further show that such nanoaggregates improve production in diluted CFPS reactions, which can help to save money and extend the amount of these costly reagents. The results are discussed in the context of what may contribute mechanistically to the enhancement and how this can be applied to other CFPS application scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W4220862201,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether tactical formation affects the physical and technical match performance of professional soccer players in the first German Bundesliga. From official match data of the Bundesliga season 2018/19, physical (total distance, high-intensity distance, sprinting distance, accelerations, maximum velocity) and technical performance (short/middle/long passes, dribblings, ball-possessions) of players were analyzed. Players were categorized into five playing positions (center back, full back, central midfielder, wide midfielder, forward) and teams into eight different tactical formations (4-4-2, 4-4-2 diamond, 4-2-2-2, 4-3-3, 4-5-1, 4-2-3-1, 3-4-3, 3-5-2). Results revealed that the degree to which tactical formation affects match performance is position dependent. In terms of physical performance, center backs and full backs showed highest sprinting distances when playing in a formation with only three defenders in the back row (3-4-3, 3-5-2) compared to all other formations (ES range: 0.13≤ES≤1.27). Regarding technical performance, all positions except forwards displayed fewer short passes, middle passes and ball-possessions in the formations 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 compared to all other formations (0.02≤ES≤1.19). In conclusion, physical and technical performance of center backs, full backs and wide midfielders differed markedly between the tactical formations. Conversely, the physical and technical performance of central midfielders and forwards only showed small differences between the different tactical formations. These findings can help coaches scheduling their practice. For example, if a coach wants to change the playing formation, he can anticipate the physical and technical match performance changes depending on the respective playing position."

In this paper, we investigated the factors contributing to the failurein the IT system of the banking industry in Bangladesh. Based on the experts' opinions and weight on the specified evaluating criteria, an empirical test was conducted using a rough set theory to produce a framework for the IT system failure factors. In this study, an extended approach involving the integration of rough set theory based flexible Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) has beenapplied to help the managers of the corresponding field to identify the factors responsible for the failure of the IT system in the banking industries and then prioritize them accordingly, for the ease of decision-making.In this research, eleven such failure factors were identified, which were then quantitatively analyzed to facilitate managers in crucial decision-making. It was observed that cyber-attack, database hack risks, server failure, network interruption, broadcast data error, and virus effect were the most significant factors for the failure of the IT system. The framework developed in this research can be utilized to assist in efficient decision-makingin other serviceindustries where IT systems play a key role. To the best of the knowledge, this is the first study thatempirically tested key failure factors of the IT system for the banking sector using an integrated method."
https://openalex.org/W4221078151,"Understanding the genetics of salt tolerance is of utmost need to combat the rising prevalence of soil salinity through employing tolerant cultivars. The current study was carried out to investigate the quantitative genetic basis of agronomical and physiological-related traits of salinity-stressed plants using seven generations (parental cultivars, F1, F2, F3, BC1, and BC2) of wheat grown in the field under normal and saline conditions. The combined analysis of variance showed highly significant effects of salinity and genotypes (generations) on all the traits. The scaling tests did not support the three-parameter model (additive-dominance model); hence, the six-parameter model was used to assess the genetic effects governing the traits in this study. The epistatic gene effects were crucial, as were additive and dominance gene effects for plant height, K/Na, and yield in salinity stress conditions. The highest heritability was observed for total chlorophyll, carotenoid, SPAD chlorophyll, and K/Na ratio in saline conditions. The additive genetic variance was more important than the dominance variance for grain weight, K, K/Na in salinity conditions. The findings of the current study may have important implications in the quantitative genetics of salinity tolerance and the development of cultivars tolerant to salinity in wheat."
https://openalex.org/W4221120707,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell malignancy that accounts for 15-20% of all cases of leukemia. CML is caused by a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 which creates an abnormal fusion gene, BCR::ABL1. The amount of BCR::ABL1 transcript RNA is a marker of disease progression and the effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. This study determined the analytical and clinical performance of a droplet digital PCR based assay (QXDx BCR-ABL %IS Kit; Bio-Rad) for BCR::ABL1 quantification. The test has a limit of detection of MR4.7 (0.002%) and a linear range of MR0.3-4.7 (50-0.002%IS). Reproducibility of results across multiple sites, days, instruments, and users was evaluated using panels made from BCR::ABL1 positive patient samples. Clinical performance of the assay was evaluated on patient samples and compared to an existing FDA-cleared test. The reproducibility study noted negligible contributions to variance from site, instrument, day, and user for samples spanning from MR 0.7-4.2. The assay demonstrated excellent clinical correlation with the comparator test using a Deming regression with a Pearson R of 0.99, slope of 1.037 and intercept of 0.1084. This data establishes that the QXDx™ BCR-ABL %IS Kit is an accurate, precise, and sensitive system for the diagnosis and monitoring of CML."
https://openalex.org/W4220904710,"Xylanase is one of industrial enzymes with diverse applications including the paper-bleaching industry and feed additives. Here, a strain having xylanolytic activity and identified as Bacillus sonorensis T6 was isolated from soil. A secretory enzyme was identified by mass-spectrometry as a xylanase of glycosyl hydrolase family 11, with a molecular weight of 23.3 kDa. The xylanase gene of Bacillus sonorensis T6 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (yielding an enzyme designated as rXynT6-E) and in Pichia pastoris (yielding rXynT6-P). The recombinant xylanases were found to have optimal activity at 47–55°C and pH 6.0–7.0. The recombinant xylanase expressed in P . pastoris has 40% higher thermal stability than that expressed in E . coli . The recombinant xylanases retained 100% of activity after 10 h incubation in the pH range 3–11 and 68% of activity after 1 h at pH 2.0. The xylanase activities of rXynT6-E and rXynT6-P under optimal conditions were 1030.2 and 873.8 U/mg, respectively. The good stability in a wide range of pH and moderate temperatures may make the xylanase from Bacillus sonorensis T6 useful for various biotechnological applications, e.g., as an enzyme additive in the feed industry."
https://openalex.org/W4220938027,"Most evidence on the relationship between sodium and potassium intake and cardiovascular disease originated from general population studies. This study aimed to evaluate the relation between estimated 24-hour sodium and potassium urinary excretion and the risk of recurrent vascular events and mortality in patients with vascular disease.7561 patients with vascular disease enrolled in the UCC-SMART cohort (1996-2015) were included. Twenty-four hour sodium and potassium urinary excretion were estimated (Kawasaki formulae) from morning urine samples. Cox proportional hazard models with restricted cubic splines were used to evaluate the relation between estimated urinary salt excretion and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; including myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality) and all-cause mortality.After a median follow-up of 7.4 years (interquartile range: 4.1-11.0), the relations between estimated 24-hour sodium urinary excretion and outcomes were J-shaped with nadirs of 4.59 gram/day for recurrent MACE and 4.97 gram/day for all-cause mortality. The relation between sodium-to-potassium excretion ratio and outcomes were also J-shaped with nadirs of 2.71 for recurrent MACE and 2.60 for all-cause mortality. Higher potassium urinary excretion was related to an increased risk of both recurrent MACE (HR 1.25 per gram potassium excretion per day; 95%CI 1.13-1.39) and all cause-mortality (HR 1.13 per gram potassium excretion per day; 95%CI 1.03-1.25).In patients with established vascular disease, lower and higher sodium intake were associated with higher risk of recurrent MACE and all-cause mortality. Higher estimated 24-hour potassium urinary excretion was associated with a higher risk of recurrent MACE and all-cause mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4221012174,"The objective of this study was to identify the correlates of being at risk of clinical depression and examine the role of syndemic factors among marginally housed and homeless transitional age youth (TAY). From 2017-2018, 100 TAY between the ages of 18 and 24 in San Francisco were recruited from Larkin Street Youth Services into a cross-sectional study. Participants completed surveys on mental health, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors. A syndemic score ranging from 0-3 was calculated by summing dichotomous measures of moderate or severe anxiety in the past two weeks, PTSD symptoms in the past month and polysubstance use in the past three months. We used modified Poisson regression with robust error variances to identify the correlates of being at risk of clinical depression in the past week, all primary effects measures were modeled separately. Among 100 participants, the average age was 21 (SD = 1.7), 67% were male, 38% were Multiracial, 54% identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or pansexual, 13% were unstably housed, 50% were homeless and 23% were living with HIV. The majority (74%) were at risk of clinical depression, 51% had symptoms of moderate or severe anxiety, 80% exhibited symptoms of PTSD and 33% reported polysubstance use. After controlling for age in years, gender, race/ethnicity and sexual orientation, factors independently associated with being at risk of clinical depression were; symptoms of moderate or severe anxiety (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-2.12, P<0.001), symptoms of PTSD (aRR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.58-9.04, P = 0.003), polysubstance use (aRR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.06-1.68), P = 0.012), an increasing syndemic score (aRR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.21-1.62), P<0.001), and having one, two or three syndemic factors (compared to none); (aRR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.08-6.65, P = 0.032), (aRR = 3.24, 95% CI = 1.24-7.83, P = 0.003) and (aRR = 3.97, 95% CI = 1.65-9.52, P = 0.002), respectively. Integrated behavioral health models that treat co-occurring disorders simultaneously are needed to reduce syndemic risk among marginally housed and homeless TAY."
https://openalex.org/W4221080620,"Ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated regulation of plasmalemmal ion channel activity canonically occurs via stimulation of endocytosis. Whether ubiquitination can modulate channel activity by alternative mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we show that the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) cation channel is multiubiquitinated within its cytosolic N-terminal and C-terminal intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Mutagenizing select lysine residues to block ubiquitination of the N-terminal but not C-terminal IDR resulted in a marked elevation of TRPV4-mediated intracellular calcium influx, without increasing cell surface expression levels. Conversely, enhancing TRPV4 ubiquitination via expression of an E3 Ub ligase reduced TRPV4 channel activity but did not decrease plasma membrane abundance. These results demonstrate Ub-dependent regulation of TRPV4 channel function independent of effects on plasma membrane localization. Consistent with ubiquitination playing a key negative modulatory role of the channel, gain-of-function neuropathy-causing mutations in the TRPV4 gene led to reduced channel ubiquitination in both cellular and Drosophila models of TRPV4 neuropathy, whereas increasing mutant TRPV4 ubiquitination partially suppressed channel overactivity. Together, these data reveal a novel mechanism via which ubiquitination of an intracellular flexible IDR domain modulates ion channel function independently of endocytic trafficking and identify a contributory role for this pathway in the dysregulation of TRPV4 channel activity by neuropathy-causing mutations."
https://openalex.org/W4220745522,"This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the association between osteoporosis and periodontal disease among Korean menopausal women, as well as the association between osteoporosis and periodontal disease according to duration after menopause.Of a total of 22,948 subjects who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, from 2013 to 2015 the final study population was limited to 2,573 subjects with no missing values. The subjects were divided into two groups, normal bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis, according to the T-score obtained from bone densitometry. Scores of ≥ 3 points for the community periodontal index of treatment needs were reclassified as periodontal disease. Moreover, after stratification of the variable 'duration after menopause' into 0-4, 5-9, and ≥10 years, binary logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between osteoporosis and periodontal disease according to the duration after menopause.There was an association between osteoporosis and periodontal disease. The osteoporosis group had an adjusted odds ratio [OR] of 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.56) for periodontal disease compared to the normal BMD group. Of note, the osteoporosis group in the menopausal transition stage (0-4 years after menopause) showed an adjusted OR of 2.08 (95% CI: 1.15-3.77) for developing periodontal disease.Osteoporosis was associated with periodontal disease and the association was strongest among women in the menopausal transition stage, 0-4 years after menopause. Oral health promotion, including regular oral examination and oral hygiene care, is particularly useful for menopausal transition women with osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W4220792114,"The health problem of postmenopausal women is emerging as an important problem due to the increased aging population. This study investigated the association between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and bone markers in postmenopausal women.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 132 postmenopausal women aged 45-70 years. The DII score was calculated using the 3-day food records and divided into tertiles according to the DII score. The lifestyle factors that could affect bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women were investigated and included the EuroQol- 5 Dimension (EQ-5D), physical activity, and eating habits. Skeletal muscle index-weight (SMIw) was used to evaluate skeletal muscle mass, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSALP), and phosphorus (P) measured as bone biomarkers. The BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and the association between anthropometric, biochemistry, BMD, and DII was assessed.In the anti-inflammatory group, a high intake of fiber, vitamins, and minerals was observed. After adjusting for confound factors, with higher DII score, percent body fat increased (β = 0.168, p = 0.012), and SMIw decreased linear regression analysis (β = -0.329, p = 0.037, respectively). For biochemistry, confound factors were adjusted, with higher DII score, ALP, BSALP and P decreased and DII score increased (β = -0.057, p = 0.002, β = -0.167, p = 0.004, β = -1.799, p = 0.026, respectively). The relationship between DII and BMD was not significant, but osteopenia increased as DII score increased.The low DII score is positively associated with low body fat, high muscle mass, elevated bone markers, and low risk of osteopenia."
https://openalex.org/W4220890168,"Zoonotic diseases are projected to be a serious public threat in the coming decades. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that Jordan prioritize their list of zoonoses, partially in response to the influx of Syrian refugees. We write this paper to expand the One Health framework by situating zoonotic diseases in peacebuilding and development theories in order to prioritize zoonotic diseases in Jordan. We employ an explanatory sequential mixed methods approach to create a modified version of the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization (OHZDP) tool. We use an integrative literature review to develop a list of zoonoses to be prioritized. We expand the One Health framework by arguing health inequity is a form of violence, and thus promotion of health equity is a form of peacebuilding. We undertake thematic and statistical analyses to assess the 12 previously published OHZDP tools to evaluate necessity for change to the process given COVID-19 and the refugee situation in Jordan. In these analyses we use drivers of health indicators as measurements for peacebuilding and development, given these drivers are related to health inequities, to guide weighting of the criteria in our tool for Jordan. We apply our modified OHZDP tool to prioritize our disease list. We find it necessary to give socioeconomic factors greater consideration and to distribute weighting more evenly among all criteria within the tool when prioritizing zoonotic diseases in better reflect the Jordanian context and incorporate the refugee population. We find the priority zoonoses within Jordan to be bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, and COVID-19, with most having a disproportionately negative impact on refugees. In Jordan’s case, zoonotic diseases represent an area where promoting social equity for individuals is essential to the larger society. In this sense managing zoonoses is an area uniquely suited for peacebuilding."
https://openalex.org/W4220901373,"Low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia including choriocarcinoma is often effectively treated with Methotrexate (MTX) as a first line therapy. However, MTX resistance (MTX-R) occurs in at least ≈33% of cases. This can sometimes be salvaged with actinomycin-D but often requires more toxic combination chemotherapy. Moreover, additional therapy may be needed and, for high-risk patients, 5% still die from the multidrug-resistant disease. Consequently, new treatments that are less toxic and could reverse MTX-R are needed. Here, we compared the proteome/phosphoproteome of MTX-resistant and sensitive choriocarcinoma cells using quantitative mass-spectrometry to identify therapeutically actionable molecular changes associated with MTX-R. Bioinformatics analysis of the proteomic data identified cell cycle and DNA damage repair as major pathways associated with MTX-R. MTX-R choriocarcinoma cells undergo cell cycle delay in G1 phase that enables them to repair DNA damage more efficiently through non-homologous end joining in an ATR-dependent manner. Increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and loss of p16Ink4a in resistant cells suggested that CDK4 inhibition may be a strategy to treat MTX-R choriocarcinoma. Indeed, inhibition of CDK4/6 using genetic silencing or the clinically relevant inhibitor, Palbociclib, induced growth inhibition both in vitro and in an orthotopic in vivo mouse model. Finally, targeting the ATR pathway, genetically or pharmacologically, re-sensitised resistant cells to MTX in vitro and potently prevented the growth of MTX-R tumours in vivo. In short, we identified two novel therapeutic strategies to tackle MTX-R choriocarcinoma that could rapidly be translated into the clinic."

Understanding the use and perceptions of menstrual products is key to promote menstrual equity and menstrual health. This study aimed at assessing the use and perceptions on menstrual products among women and people who menstruate aged 18-55 in Spain.A mixed-methods study was conducted, including a cross-sectional study (N = 22,823), and a qualitative study (N = 34).Participants used a combination of products. Non-reusable products were the most used, while over half used reusable products. Usage changed when data were stratified by age, gender identification, completed education, country of birth and experiencing financial issues. It also varied between trans and cis participants. Menstrual products' use also shifted based on experiences of menstrual poverty and access to information and products. Overall, reusable products were perceived to be more acceptable than non-reusable. Barriers to use the menstrual cup were also identified, including experiences of menstrual inequity (e.g., menstrual poverty, lack of access to information or menstrual management facilities).Perceptions and choices of menstrual products need to be acknowledged, especially when designing and implementing menstrual policies to address menstrual inequity and menstrual health."
https://openalex.org/W4221026115,"Through continuous innovation and improvement, Nanopore sequencing has become a powerful technology. Because of its fast processing time, low cost, and ability to generate long reads, this sequencing technique would be particularly suitable for clinical diagnostics. However, its raw data accuracy is inferior in contrast to other sequencing technologies. This constraint still results in limited use of Nanopore sequencing in the field of clinical diagnostics and requires further validation and IVD certification.We evaluated the performance of latest Nanopore sequencing in combination with a dedicated data-analysis pipeline for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of the familial Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV) by amplicon sequencing of 47 clinical samples. Mutations in MEFV are associated with Mediterranean fever, a hereditary periodic fever syndrome. Conventional Sanger sequencing, which is commonly applied in clinical genetic diagnostics, was used as a reference method.Nanopore sequencing enabled the sequencing of 10 target regions within MEFV with high read depth (median read depth 7565x) in all samples and identified a total of 435 SNPs in the whole sample collective, of which 29 were unique. Comparison of both sequencing workflows showed a near perfect agreement with no false negative calls. Precision, Recall, and F1-Score of the Nanopore sequencing workflow were > 0.99, respectively.These results demonstrated the great potential of current Nanopore sequencing for application in clinical diagnostics, at least for SNP genotyping by amplicon sequencing. Other more complex applications, especially structural variant identification, require further in-depth clinical validation."
https://openalex.org/W4221029884,"Isoflavonoids with various structural elements show a promising potential effect on central nervous system activities. Despite their favorable medicinal properties, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of this thoroughly investigated group of natural phenolics have only been described to a limited extent. Regarding the lack of information about the BBB permeability of isoflavones, isoflavanones, and pterocarpans found in Ononis species, the aim of our study was to investigate their physico-chemical properties influencing their absorption and distribution. Furthermore, we aimed to characterize the possible MAO-B inhibiting features of Ononis isoflavonoids in silico. Octanol-water partitioning and BBB-PAMPA permeability of formononetin, calycosin D, onogenin, sativanone, medicarpin and maackiain were assessed for the first time in our study. The log P values ranged from 2.21 to 3.03 and log D7.4 values from 2.48 to 3.03, respectively, indicating optimal polarity for BBB permeation. The results of PAMPA-BBB expressed as log Pe values fell between -5.60 and -4.45, predicting their good permeation capability as well. The effective permeability values showed structure-dependent differences, indicating that the pterocarpan type skeleton was the most preferred type, followed by isoflavanones, then isoflavones. The methoxy or methylenedioxy substitution of the same skeleton did not influence the permeability significantly, contrary to an additional hydroxyl group. Membrane retention showed a similar structure dependent pattern to that of effective permeability, ranging from 16% to 70%. For the identification of volumes of chemical space related to particular biological activities the ChemGPS-NP framework was used. The MAO-B inhibitory potency and selectivity were also predicted and validated. Based on our results, MAO-B inhibitory potency could be predicted with good precision, but in the case of selectivity, only the direction could be concluded (favors MAO-B or MAO-A), not the magnitude. Our finding reflects that Ononis isoflavonoid aglycones show an excellent fit with the suggested parameters for BBB permeability and this is the first study to confirm the highly favorable position of these natural products for MAO-B inhibition."

To validate the score, we used data from 1,299 participants from the Religious Order Study (92% White), and to assess generalizability, 679 participants from the Minority Aging Research Study (100% Black).Clinician-based dementia diagnosis at any time after baseline and predictive variables associated with dementia risk that can be collected in a primary care setting: demographics, clinical indicators, medical history, memory complaints, cognitive and motor tests, and questions to assess functional disability, depressive symptoms, sleep, social isolation, and genetics (APOE e4 and AD polygenic risk score).At baseline, age, memory complaint, the ability to handle finances, the recall of the month, recall of the room, and recall of three words, were associated with the cumulative incidence of dementia, in the derivation cohort. The discrimination of the RADaR (Rapid Risk Assessment of Dementia) was good for the derivation and external-validation cohorts (AUC3 years = 0.82-0.86), compared to the overall discrimination of age alone (AUC3 years = 0.73), a major risk factor for dementia. Adding genetic data did not increase discrimination.Participants were volunteers, may not represent the general population.The RADaR, derived from community-dwelling older persons, is a brief and valid tool to predict dementia risk at 3 years in older White and Black persons."
https://openalex.org/W4220811723,"Despite substantial evidence on the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), there is still limited evidence on the individual effects of different types of NPIs on social distancing, especially in low- and middle-income countries.We used panel data analysis to evaluate the effects of mandatory social distancing rules on social distancing. We obtained data on six different categories of mandatory restrictions implemented in Brazil, by date and state, from state government gazettes (diários oficiais). We then defined a social distancing rules index (SDI) to measure the strictness of social distancing rules, assigning each a value of 2, 1, or 0 depending on whether restrictions were full, partial, or very limited/non-existent at every given time. A separate variable was defined for masking mandates. We tested whether the following variables were associated to social distancing: SDI, masking mandates, COVID-19 incidence, population socioeconomic status, and political orientation. Data is for each day between March 11th and November 10th, 2020 in the 27 Brazilian states (N = 6615).Social distancing increased when social distancing rules were stricter, and decreased when the use of face masks became mandatory. The effects of different types of restrictions varied: suspending in-person classes and gatherings, religious/sport/cultural activities had a greater effect than other types of restrictions. Also, the effect of social distancing rules on people's behaviour decreased over time, especially when rules were stricter.Mandatory social distancing rules must be adopted to increase social distancing. Stricter rules have a higher impact, but result in decreased compliance over time. Policymakers should prioritize more targeted policies."
https://openalex.org/W4220898544,"Skin colonization with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) is generally beneficial, but recent investigations suggest its association with flares and atopic dermatitis (AD) severity. However, this relationship remains unclear.To assess patterns of staphylococcal colonization and biofilm formation in toddlers with and without AD from rural and urban South African settings.We conducted a cross-sectional study of AD-affected and non-atopic AmaXhosa toddlers from rural Umtata and urban Cape Town, South Africa. CoNS isolates were recovered from lesional, nonlesional skin samples and the anterior nares of participants. Identification of the staphylococci was achieved by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The microtiter plate assay assessed in-vitro biofilm formation.CoNS and S. aureus commonly co-colonized nonlesional skin among cases (urban: 24% vs. 3%, p = 0.037 and rural 21% vs. 6%, p<0.001), and anterior nares in urban cases (24% vs. 0%, p = 0.002) than the control group. S. capitis colonization on nonlesional skin and anterior nares was positively associated with more severe disease in rural (48.3±10.8 vs. 39.7±11.5, P = 0.045) and urban cases (74.9±10.3 vs. 38.4±13, P = 0.004), respectively. Biofilm formation was similar between cases and controls, independent of rural-urban living.CoNS colonization is associated with AD and disease severity and may be implicated in AD exacerbations. Studies are needed to understand their underlying pathological contribution in AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4220962208,"Hepcidin which is the crucial regulator of iron homeostasis, produced in the liver in response to anemia, hypoxia, or inflammation. Recent studies have suggested that hepcidin and iron metabolism are involved in osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoblast function and promoting osteoclastogenesis. Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) is a heparin analogue and promising novel therapeutic for osteoarthritis (OA). This study was undertaken to determine whether PPS inhibits hepcidin-facilitated osteoclast (OC) differentiation and iron overload. Canine (n = 3) bone marrow mononuclear cells were differentiated to OC by macrophage colony-stimulating factor and receptor-activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand with the treatment of hepcidin1 (200, 400, 800, 1200 nmol/L) and PPS (1, 5, 10, 20, 40 μg/mL). Differentiation and function of OC were accessed using tartrate-resistant acid phosphate staining and bone resorption assay while monitoring ferroportin1 (FPN1) and iron concentration by immunocytochemistry. Gene expression of OC for cathepsin K (CTK), matrix metallopeptidase-9, nuclear factor of activated-T-cells cytoplasmic 1 and FPN1 was examined. Hepcidin1 showed significant enhancement of OC number at 800 nmol/L (p&lt;0.01). PPS impeded hepcidin-facilitated OC at 1, 5 and 10 μg/mL and reduction of resorption pits at 5 and 10 μg/mL (p&lt; 0.01). All OC specific genes were downregulated with PPS, specifically in significant manner with CTK at higher concentrations. However, heparin induced FPN1 internalization and degradation was inhibited at higher concentrations of PPS while restoring iron-releasing capability of OC. We demonstrate for the first time that PPS is a novel-inhibitor of hepcidin-facilitated OC formation/function which might be beneficial for treatment of OA and osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W4220980077,"Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissues are routinely collected, archived, and used for clinical diagnosis, including maternal and neonatal health. Applying FFPE samples to microbiota research would be beneficial to reduce preparation, storage and costs associated with limited available frozen samples. This research aims to understand if FFPE fetal membrane samples are comparable to frozen tissues, which are the current gold standard for DNA microbiota analysis. Extracted DNA from nine matched paired patients were sequenced by Illumina sequencing of the V4 16S rRNA gene region. This included duplicate frozen amnion and chorion fetal membrane rolls or FFPE combined amniochorionic samples. Negative controls of surrounding wax blocks and DNA extraction reagents were processed alongside samples using identical methods. DNA quality and quantity was assessed by NanoDrop, agarose gel electrophoresis and Bioanalyzer. Decontam and SourceTracker were integrated into microbiota analysis to identify the presence of contaminating sources. The bacterial profile and nine genera differed between FFPE and frozen fetal membranes. There were no differences in bacterial profiles between FFPE samples and corresponding wax negative controls, with 49% of bacteria in FFPE fetal membrane samples matched to the source origin of paraffin wax, and 40% originating from DNA extraction reagent sources. FFPE samples displayed high fragmentation and low quantity of extracted DNA compared to frozen samples. The microbiota of FFPE fetal membrane samples is influenced by processing methods, with the inability to differentiate between the microbiota of the tissue sample and the surrounding wax block. Illumina sequencing results of FFPE and frozen fetal membrane samples should not be compared using the methods employed here. Variation could be influenced by limitations including storage time, DNA extraction and purification methods. To utilise FFPE fetal membrane samples in microbiota research then contamination prevention and detection methods must be included into optimised and standardised protocols, with recommendations presented here."
https://openalex.org/W4221003527,"Drinking in private or other unlicensed settings before going out (i.e., pre-drinking) is increasingly being identified as a common behaviour amongst students as it provides an opportunity to extend their drinking duration and socialise. However, studies suggest associations between pre-drinking and alcohol-related harms. This study examines Brazilian and British university students’ pre-drinking patterns and associations with nightlife-related harms amongst drinkers. A total of 1,151 Brazilian and 424 British students (aged 18+ years) completed an online survey. The questionnaire covered sociodemographic variables, nightlife drinking behaviour including pre-drinking and past 12 months experience of alcohol-related harms. Most participants were female (BRA 59.1%, ENG 65.3%; p = 0.027), undergraduate students (BRA 88.2%, ENG 71.2%; p &lt;0.001) and aged 18–25 years (BRA 78.8%, ENG 81.5%; p &lt;0.001). Pre-drinking was more prevalent in England (82.8%) than Brazil (44.0%; p &lt;0.001), yet Brazilian students drank more units of alcohol than British students when pre-drinking (BRA 17.6, ENG 12.1; p &lt;0.001). In multi-variate analyses, pre-drinking was significantly associated with increased odds of experiencing a range of harms across both countries (e.g., blackouts; failing to attend university), with the strength of associations varying between countries. Pre-drinking in Brazil and in England is an important event before going out amongst university students, however our study shows it is associated with a range of harms in both countries. Thus, preventing pre-drinking may be a crucial strategy to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and related harms in the nightlife context across countries with diverse nightlife environments and alcohol drinking cultures."
https://openalex.org/W4221097006,"While high rate algal ponds (HRAPs) can provide efficient pathogen removal from wastewater, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, the mechanisms potentially causing Escherichia coli (E. coli) removal during microalgae-based wastewater treatment were successively assessed using laboratory microcosms designed to isolate known mechanisms, and bench scale assays performed in real HRAP broth. During laboratory assays, E. coli decay was only significantly increased by alkaline pH (above temperature-dependent thresholds) due to pH induced toxicity, and direct sunlight exposure via UV-B damage and/or endogenous photo-oxidation. Bench assays confirmed alkaline pH toxicity caused significant decay but sunlight-mediated decay was not significant, likely due to light attenuation in the HRAP broth. Bench assays also evidenced the existence of uncharacterized 'dark' decay mechanism(s) not observed in laboratory microcosms. To numerically evaluate the contribution of each mechanism and the uncertainty associated, E. coli decay was modelled assuming dark decay, alkaline pH induced toxicity, and direct sunlight-mediated decay were independent mechanisms. The simulations confirmed E. coli decay was mainly caused by dark decay during bench assays (48.2-89.5% estimated contribution to overall decay at the 95% confidence level), followed by alkaline-pH induced toxicity (8.3-46.5%), and sunlight-mediated decay (0.0-21.9%)."
https://openalex.org/W4220720679,"A wide range of phytobiotic feed additives are available on the market claiming to have beneficial effects on the growth of the host animal and to promote the development of a balanced microflora. The present study investigated the effects of the phytobiotic-prebiotic mixture of curcumin, wheat germ, and chicory on the growth performance and on the intestinal microflora composition of weaning piglets. Post weaning diarrhea causes significant losses for the producers, most commonly it is prevented by feeding high doses of zinc oxide (ZnO). The effect of a phytobiotic-prebiotic feed additive (1 kg T-1) was compared to a positive control (3.1 kg T-1 ZnO) and to a negative control (no feed supplement) in an in vivo animal trial. There was no significant difference in the final body weight and average daily gain of the trial and positive control groups, and both groups showed significantly (P<0.05) better results than the negative control. The feed conversion ratio of the phytobiotic-prebiotic supplemented group was significantly improved (P<0.05) compared to both controls. Both phytobiotic-prebiotic mixture and ZnO were able to significantly reduce (P<0.05) the amount of coliforms after weaning, even though ZnO reduced the amount of coliforms more efficiently than the trial feed additive, it also reduced the amount of potentially beneficial bacteria. Metagenomic data also corroborated the above conclusion. In the trial and positive control groups, the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae decreased by 85 and 88% between 3 weeks and 6 weeks of age, while in the negative control group a slight increase occurred. Lactobacillaceae were more abundant in the trial group (29.98%) than in the positive (8.67%) or in the negative (22.45%) control groups at 6 weeks of age. In summary, this study demonstrated that a phytobiotic-prebiotic feed additive may be a real alternative to ZnO for the prevention of post weaning diarrhea and promote the development of a balanced gut system."
https://openalex.org/W4220750367,"The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system is a major DNA repair system that corrects DNA replication errors. In eukaryotes, the MMR system functions via mechanisms both dependent on and independent of exonuclease 1 (EXO1), an enzyme that has multiple roles in DNA metabolism. Although the mechanism of EXO1-dependent MMR is well understood, less is known about EXO1-independent MMR. Here, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that the DNA2 nuclease/helicase has a role in EXO1-independent MMR. Biochemical reactions reconstituted with purified human proteins demonstrated that the nuclease activity of DNA2 promotes an EXO1-independent MMR reaction via a mismatch excision-independent mechanism that involves DNA polymerase δ. We show that DNA polymerase ε is not able to replace DNA polymerase δ in the DNA2-promoted MMR reaction. Unlike its nuclease activity, the helicase activity of DNA2 is dispensable for the ability of the protein to enhance the MMR reaction. Further examination established that DNA2 acts in the EXO1-independent MMR reaction by increasing the strand-displacement activity of DNA polymerase δ.

Our data have indicated that the nuclease activity of DNA2 enhances the strand-displacement activity of Pol δ holoenzyme in an EXO1-independent MMR reaction. We started this work to investigate whether DNA2 has a role in MMR. Our initial genetic analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that introduction of a temperature-sensitive dna2 allele (55Budd M.E. Campbell J.L.

We then used the CAN1 mutation assay to examine how dna2-P504S interacted with exo1Δ and msh6Δ, two alleles that cause MMR defects. The data showed that there was a synergistic relationship between dna2-P504S and exo1Δ, but not between dna2-P504S and msh6Δ (Fig. 1). Next, we determined can1 mutation spectra in the WT, dna2-P504S, exo1Δ, dna2-P504S exo1Δ, msh2Δ, and msh2Δ dna2-P504S exo1Δ strains (Table 1). The can1 spectrum in the dna2-P504S strain was dominated by base–base substitutions, but some 1-nt deletions and mutational events that caused CAN1 loss were also observed. Comparison of the mutation spectra in the dna2-P504S, exo1Δ, and dna2-P504S exo1Δ showed that there was a synergistic interaction between dna2-P504S and exo1Δ for base substitutions and 1-nt deletions. Further analysis revealed that msh2Δ was epistatic to dna2-P504S exo1Δ for base substitutions. The observations that (i) msh2Δ was epistatic to dna2-P504S exo1Δ for base substitutions and that (ii) there was a synergistic relationship between dna2-P504S and exo1Δ for base substitutions supported the hypothesis that DNA2 is involved in an Msh2-dependent pathway that repairs base–base mismatches in an Exo1-independent manner. We also observed that there was a weak synergistic relationship between msh2Δ and dna2-P504S exo1Δ for 1-nt deletions. This is likely a result of participation of DNA2 in another genetic stabilization pathway.Table 1msh2Δ is epistatic to dna2-P504S exo1Δ for base substitutions in CAN1GenotypeMutation rate (× 10−8)Base–base substitutions1-nt deletions1-nt insertionsCAN1 lossOther mutationsTotalWT (n=50)201.51.5<0.51.524 (21–34)dna2-P504S (n=50)428<281170 (50–90)exo1Δ (n=50)11014<2.8<2.814140 (130–190)dna2-P504S exo1Δ (n=80)28069292363460 (300–510)msh2Δ (n=82)435"
https://openalex.org/W4220784348,"Ipomoea is a large pantropical genus globally distributed, which importance goes beyond the economic value as food resources or ornamental crops. This highly diverse genus has been the focus of a great number of studies, enriching the plant genomics knowledge, and challenging the plant evolution models. In the Carajás mountain range, located in Eastern Amazon, the savannah-like ferruginous ecosystem known as canga harbors highly specialized plant and animal populations, and Ipomoea is substantially representative in such restrictive habitat. Thus, to provide genetic data and insights into whole plastome phylogenetic relationships among key Ipomoea species from Eastern Amazon with little to none previously available data, we present the complete plastome sequences of twelve lineages of the genus, including the canga microendemic I. cavalcantei, the closely related I. marabaensis, and their putative hybrids. The twelve plastomes presented similar gene content as most publicly available Ipomoea plastomes, although the putative hybrids were correctly placed as closely related to the two parental species. The cavalcantei-marabaensis group was consistently grouped between phylogenetic methods. The closer relationship of the I. carnea plastome with the cavalcantei-marabaensis group, as well as the branch formed by I. quamoclit, I. asarifolia and I. maurandioides, were probably a consequence of insufficient taxonomic representativity, instead of true genetic closeness, reinforcing the importance of new plastome assemblies to resolve inconsistencies and boost statistical confidence, especially the case for South American clades of Ipomoea. The search for k-mers presenting high dispersion among the frequency distributions pointed to highly variable coding and intergenic regions, which may potentially contribute to the genetic diversity observed at species level. Our results contribute to the resolution of uncertain clades within Ipomoea and future phylogenomic studies, bringing unprecedented results to Ipomoea species with restricted distribution, such as I. cavalcantei."
https://openalex.org/W4220860043,"Several studies have investigated factors influencing baseball pitching velocity. However, some measurements require expensive equipment, and some tests need familiarity to perform well. In this study, we adopted field tests executed using affordable equipment in a tryout event for a professional baseball team in Taiwan, 2019. We use half day to test 64 players, and the result of measurement are used to develop a model for predicting pitching velocity of amateur adult pitchers (age: 23.9 ± 2.8 years; height: 180.3 ± 5.9 cm; weight: 81.4 ± 10.9 kg). The measurements and tests in tryout settings should be easy to implement, take short time, do not need high skill levels, and correlate to the pitching velocity. The outcome measures included maximum external shoulder rotation, maximum internal shoulder rotation, countermovement jump (CMJ) height, 20-kg loaded CMJ height, 30-m sprint time, height, age, and weight tests. Multiple regression indicated a moderate correlation between these tests and pitching velocity (adjusted R2 = 0.230, p = 0.0003). Among the measures, the ratio of loaded CMJ to CMJ, ratio of first 10-m sprint time to 30-m sprint time, and height were significant contributors to pitching velocity. Overall, these measures explained 23% of the variance in the predicted pitching velocity. These field tests can be adopted in tryout events to predict a prospect's potential and to identify underestimated players. Coaches can obtain an expectation of a pitcher's performance by comparing his pitching velocity with the predicted value derived from the statistical model presented herein, and the room of growth by comparing his current strength to average strength growth after being drafted and trained with professional coaches."

Field experiments were conducted to evaluate broccoli yield response to crop water productivity (CWP), irrigation water productivity (IWP) and economics under varied irrigation regimes and mulching. Four levels of irrigation: surface irrigation at 1.0 IW/CPE (irrigation water to cumulative pan evaporation, I1), drip irrigation at 0.6 (I2), 0.8 (I3) and 1.0 (I4) of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and three mulches: none (M0), black polythene mulch (BPM, M1) and paddy straw mulch (PSM, M2) were examined. Among these treatments I3M1 produced the higher yield (19.17 t ha-1), CWP, IWP and maximum benefit-cost ratio (BCR), being almost competitive with I3M1. Under scarcity of water, I2M1 was an alternative. Drip irrigation could save 21.2-52.7% water over surface irrigation which accommodated 17.1 to 53.3% additional area under irrigation. Yield response factor and water-yield production function suggested the potential yield decrease in relation to increased deficit irrigation. However, a deficit drip irrigation scheduling with 0.8 ETc at a 3-day interval is optimum for increased curd yield, water productivity and economics of broccoli."
https://openalex.org/W4220946758,"Periodontitis is one of the most common infectious diseases in humans. It is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the tooth-supporting tissue that results in bone loss. However, the role and source of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) and of the cells producing it locally in the gingiva is still controversial. Th17 αβ T cells, CD4+ exFoxP3+ αβ T cells, or IL-17-producing γδ T cells (γδ17 cells) seem to be decisive cellular players in periodontal inflammation. To address these issues in an experimental model for periodontitis, we employed genetic mouse models deficient for either γδ T cells or IL-17 cytokines and assessed the bone loss during experimental periodontal inflammation by stereomicroscopic, histological, and μCT-analysis. Furthermore, we performed flow-cytometric analyses and qPCR-analyses of the gingival tissue. We found no γδ T cell- or IL-17-dependent change in bone loss after four weeks of periodontitis. Apart from that, our data are complementary with earlier studies, which suggested IL-17-dependent aggravation of bone loss in early periodontitis, but a rather bone-protective role for IL-17 in late stages of experimental periodontitis with respect to the osteoclastogenicity defined by the RANKL/OPG ratio."

Here we report the discovery of TCR mimic monoclonal antibodies (TCRm mAb) specific for the HPV E7 protein p11-19, YMLDLQPET, when presented on the cell surface in the context of HLA-A*02:01 by use of human phage display libraries. One of the mAbs, 3F8, was able to specifically mediate T cell- redirected cytotoxicity, in a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) form. While further studies are required to assess the therapeutic potential of this approach, the study provided the proof of concept that TCRm mAb could be a therapeutic strategy for HPV-induced human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4221124543,"Physalia physalis , the bluebottle in Australia, are colonial siphonophores that live at the surface of the ocean, mainly in tropical and subtropical waters. P. physalis are sometimes present in large swarms, and with tentacles capable of intense stings, they can negatively impact public health and commercial fisheries. P. physalis , which does not swim, is advected by ocean currents and winds acting on its gas-filled sail. While previous studies have attempted to model the drift of P. physalis , little is known about its sources, distribution, and the timing of its arrival to shore. In this study, we present a dataset with four years of daily P. physalis beachings and stings reports at three locations off Sydney’s coast in Australia. We investigate the spatial and temporal variability of P. physalis presence (beachings and stings) in relation to different environmental parameters. This dataset shows a clear seasonal pattern where more P. physalis beachings occur in the Austral summer and less in winter. Cold ocean temperatures do not hinder the presence of P. physalis and the temperature seasonal cycle and that observed in P. physalis presence/absence time-series are out of phase by 3-4 months. We identify wind direction as the major driver of the temporal variability of P. physalis arrival to the shore, both at daily and seasonal time-scales. The differences observed between sites of the occurrence of beaching events is consistent with the geomorphology of the coastline which influences the frequency and direction of favorable wind conditions. We also show that rip currents, a physical mechanism occurring at the scale of the beach, can be a predictor of beaching events. This study is a first step towards understanding the dynamics of P. physalis transport and ultimately being able to predict its arrival to the coast and mitigating the number of people who experience painful stings and require medical help."
https://openalex.org/W4220782151,"We report an assessment of the ability of the Locally-Adaptive Model of Archaeological Potential (LAMAP) to estimate archaeological potential in relation to hunter-gatherer sites. The sample comprised 182 known sites in the Tanana Valley, Alaska, which was occupied solely by hunter-gatherers for about 14,500 years. To estimate archaeological potential, we employed physiographic variables such as elevation and slope, rather than variables that are known to vary on short time scales, like vegetation cover. Two tests of LAMAP were carried out. In the first, we used the location of a random selection of 90 sites from all time periods to create a LAMAP model. We then evaluated the model with the remaining 92 sites. In the second test, we built a LAMAP model from 12 sites that pre-date 10,000 cal BP. This model was then tested with sites that post-date 10,000 cal BP. In both analyses, areas predicted to have higher archaeological potential contained higher frequencies of validation sites. The performance of LAMAP in the two tests was comparable to its performance in previous tests using archaeological sites occupied by agricultural societies. Thus, the study extends the use of LAMAP to the task of estimating archaeological potential of landscapes in relation to hunter-gatherer sites."
https://openalex.org/W4220844665,"Cutlassfishes, also known as hairtails, include multiple predatory fishes of the family Trichiuridae. They constitute a top marine fish commodity globally, yet the knowledge about their composition and intraspecific genetic structures is still limited. Trichiurus japonicus accounts for a major amount in the northwest Pacific fishery. Previous studies based on mitochondrial DNA markers reported incongruences in its population structure, hence prompting the need for high-resolution markers and avoiding possible shortcomings in its management. Here we genotyped ten novel de novo-assembled transcriptome-derived microsatellite markers on a total of 150 samples across five major fishing grounds (encompassing latitudes 22-39°N). These markers presented a high number of alleles and heterozygosity compared to other marine fishes, corresponding to the large effective population size of ~20,000 per location and cohort differentiation. Population structuring analyses suggested T. japonicus to be a homogenous well-mixed population. This configuration is likely attributed to the majority of its effective population migrates across locations, and the absence of oceanographic barriers at the continental shelves. Qingdao with reportedly high ocean productivity could be a genetic pseudosink based on the high heterozygosity and migratory preference. Moreover, the results of sign tests suggest that T. japonicus experienced a recent bottleneck likely concurrent with historical glaciation events. Further, we demonstrated satisfactory cross-amplifications of our markers on several congeners, indicating a great promise to use these markers to study the population genetics of trichiurids. Together, our findings will serve as an essential groundwork for enhancing resource conservation and management of cutlassfishes."
https://openalex.org/W4220854780,"Humans tend to perceptually distort (dilate/shrink) the duration of brief stimuli presented in a sequence when discriminating the duration of a second stimulus (Comparison) from the duration of a first stimulus (Standard). This type of distortion, termed “Time order error” (TOE), is an important window into the determinants of subjective perception. We hypothesized that stimulus durations would be optimally processed, suppressing subjective distortions in serial perception, if the events to be compared fell within the boundaries of rhythmic attentive sampling (4–8 Hz, theta band). We used a two-interval forced choice (2IFC) experimental design, and in three separate experiments tested different Standard durations: 120-ms, corresponding to an 8.33 Hz rhythmic attentive window; 160 ms, corresponding to a 6.25 Hz window; and 200 ms, for a 5 Hz window. We found that TOE, as measured by the Constant Error metric, is sizeable for a 120-ms Standard, is reduced for a 160-ms Standard, and statistically disappears for 200-ms Standard events, confirming our hypothesis. For 120- and 160-ms Standard events, to reduce TOEs it was necessary to increase the interval between the Standard and the Comparison event from sub-second (400, 800 ms) to supra-second (1600, 2000 ms) lags, suggesting that the orienting of attention in time waiting for the Comparison event to onset may work as a back-up strategy to optimize its encoding. Our results highlight the flexible use of two different attentive strategies to optimize subjective time perception."
https://openalex.org/W4220917392,"The co-editor networks of academic journals are generally examined at the journal level. This paper investigates the geographies of the global co-editor network in oncology through the lens of cities. After using different network methods to analyze the global co-editor network, we found that the network can be characterized by a core-periphery structure. The dense core is occupied by many highly interconnected cities, whereas the periphery contains many cities maintaining loose connections with the core cities. The core shows an asymmetric dual sub-core structure. The greater sub-core is constituted by Northern American cities with New York, Washington DC, Boston, Houston, and Los Angeles in the center, whereas the smaller sub-core is formed by Asian cities and centered on Tokyo, Seoul, Osaka, Beijing, and Shanghai. The European core cities do not form a well-outlined sub-core but produce a ringlike shape around the Northern American core. This structure of the co-editor network is a consequence of the prestige effect still characterizing global science. Many European and Chinese journals tend to employ Northern American editors (US-based editors in the first place) to help increase the reputation of the journal. However, US-based journals are more interested in recruiting American editors from the top-ranked national cancer centers and universities rather than outside of the country."
https://openalex.org/W4220955122,"Background The incidence of follicular lymphoma (FL) in Taiwan has not been well investigated since its inclusion as a histological subtype in the Taiwan Cancer Registry in 2008. The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence patterns of FL in Taiwan and compare the trends with those in other racial groups in the United States. Materials and methods We conducted an epidemiological study using population-based data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry, Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the 18 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries to evaluate the FL incidence from 2008 to 2017. We calculated the annual percent change (APC) to describe the trends in the incidence of FL in subpopulations defined by race and sex over time. Results The annual age-adjusted incidence rate of FL in Taiwan increased significantly from 0.59 per 100,000 persons in 2008 to 0.82 per 100,000 persons in 2017, with an APC of 3.2. By contrast, the incidence rate in whites in the United States during the same period decreased from 3.42 to 2.74 per 100,000 persons, with an APC of −2.1. We found no significant change for the blacks (APC, −1.5%), Hispanics (APC, −0.7%), and Asians or Pacific Islanders (APC, +0.7%). The temporal trend was similar between the males and females. The relative frequency of FL among the incident non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases also increased significantly in Taiwan from 7.64% in 2008 to 11.11% in 2017 (APC = 3.8). The relative frequency of FL among the incident NHL cases in the whites decreased from 2008 to 2012 (APC, −3.8%) and then stabilized after 2012 (APC, −0.2%). By contrast, little change in relative frequency of FL among the incident NHL cases was observed in the blacks, Hispanics, and APIs between 2008 and 2017. Conclusion We found increases in the incidence of FL and the relative frequency of FL among the incident NHL cases in both males and females in Taiwan from 2008 to 2017. The FL incidence rates were unchanged for all races and sex groups in the United States, except for the decreases in the whites."
https://openalex.org/W4220983689,"The growing demands on protein producers and the dwindling available resources have made Hermetia illucens (the black soldier fly, BSF) an economically important species. Insights into the genome of this insect will better allow for robust breeding protocols, and more efficient production to be used as a replacement of animal feed protein. The use of microRNA as a method to understand how gene regulation allows insect species to adapt to changes in their environment, has been established in multiple species. The baseline and life stage expression levels established in this study, allow for insight into the development and sex-linked microRNA regulation in BSF. To accomplish this, microRNA was extracted and sequenced from 15 different libraries with each life stage in triplicate. Of the total 192 microRNAs found, 168 were orthologous to known arthropod microRNAs and 24 microRNAs were unique to BSF. Twenty-six of the 168 microRNAs conserved across arthropods had a statistically significant (p < 0.05) differential expression between Egg to Larval stages. The development from larva to pupa was characterized by 16 statistically significant differentially expressed microRNA. Seven and 9 microRNA were detected as statistically significant between pupa to adult female and pupa to adult male, respectively. All life stages had a nearly equal split between up and down regulated microRNAs. Ten of the unique 24 miRNA were detected exclusively in one life stage. The egg life stage expressed five microRNA (hil-miR-m, hil-miR-p, hil-miR-r, hil-miR-s, and hil-miR-u) not seen in any other life stages. The female adult and pupa life stages expressed one miRNA each hil-miR-h and hil-miR-ac respectively. Both male and female adult life stages expressed hil-miR-a, hil-miR-b, and hil-miR-y. There were no unique microRNAs found only in the larva stage. Twenty-two microRNAs with 56 experimentally validated target genes in the closely related Drosophila melanogaster were identified. Thus, the microRNA found display the unique evolution of BSF, along with the life stages and potential genes to target for robust mass rearing. Understanding of the microRNA expression in BSF will further their use in the crucial search for alternative and sustainable protein sources."
https://openalex.org/W4220867533,"A majority of non-invasive prenatal screening studies determining fetal RhD status have been tested on Caucasian and Asian populations, but limited or no studies have been conducted on the Ethiopian population. In the current study, we carried non-invasive prenatal screening of fetal RHD genotype in selected RhD negative Ethiopian pregnant women.Cell-free DNA was extracted from the plasma samples of 117 RhD pregnant women between 9 and 38 weeks of gestation. Fetal RHD genotypes were detected by targeting exons 5, 7 and 10 of the RHD gene by using real-time PCR assay. RHD genotypic results were confirmed by neonatal cord blood serology.Fetal RHD genotyping was conclusive in all 117 subjects. RHD genotype was correctly predicted in 115 of 117 cases, thus the test yielded 98.3% accuracy (95%CI: 97.3-99.1%). Among 115 cases, 105 were genotyped as RHD positive and 12 were genotyped as RHD negative. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 99.1% (95% CI: 94.8-99.9%) and 91.7% (95%CI: 61.5-99.7%) respectively. The negative and positive predictive values were 99.9% (95%CI: 99.2-99.9%) and 54.0% (95% CI: 15.2-88.4%) respectively. SRY genotyping results were in complete concordance with fetal sex.Multi exon targeted non-invasive prenatal screening test for fetal RhD determination exhibited high accuracy and sensitivity. A confirmatory study with a bigger size of study subjects is warranted before enabling clinical implementation."
https://openalex.org/W4221006993,"This study seeks to explore the association between grandchild care and Attitudes Towards Own Ageing, assessing whether the commencement of, or ceasing, grandchild care is associated with changes in grandparents' perspectives on ageing.Longitudinal data were drawn from a population-based sample of community-dwelling individuals aged ≥40 years in Germany. The Attitudes Toward Own Ageing subscale of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Moral Scale (PGCMS) was used to measure Attitudes Towards Own Ageing. To determine whether respondents provided grandchild care, respondents were asked ""I'd now like to go on to learn more about your activities and pastimes. Do you supervise other people's children privately, e.g. your grandchildren, or the children of siblings, neighbors, friends or acquaintances?"" Symmetric and asymmetric linear fixed effects regressions were used to assess within-person changes longitudinally.No statistically significant association between providing care for grandchildren and Attitudes Towards Own Ageing was found. Significant associations were found between Attitudes Towards Own Ageing and employment status. Namely, retirement was associated with more positive Attitudes Towards Own Ageing (β = 0.57, p < .001), as was not being employed (β = 0.57, p < .001). A significant association between self-rated health and Attitudes Towards Own Ageing was also found (β = -0.06, p < .001), with poorer self-rated health associated with more negative Attitudes Towards Own Ageing.Our findings suggest that undertaking grandchild care does not shape Attitudes Towards Own Ageing. As our findings did not align with existing evidence on the associations between grandchild caregiving and measures of subjective ageing, further research is required."
https://openalex.org/W4221008487,"One of the multiple factors determining the onset of the diarrhoeal disease caused by enteropathogenic Bacillus cereus is the ability of the bacteria to actively move towards the site of infection. This ability depends on flagella, but it also varies widely between different strains. To gain more insights into these strain-specific variations, polyclonal rabbit antisera as well as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated in this study, which detected recombinant and natural B. cereus flagellin proteins in Western blots as well as in enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Based on mAb 1A11 and HRP-labelled rabbit serum, a highly specific sandwich EIA was developed. Overall, it could be shown that strain-specific swimming motility correlates with the presence of flagella/flagellin titres obtained in EIAs. Interestingly, mAb 1A11, recognizing an epitope in the N-terminal region of the flagellin protein, proved to inhibit bacterial swimming motility, while the rabbit serum rather decreased growth of selected B. cereus strains. Altogether, powerful tools enabling the in-depth characterization of the strain-specific variations in B. cereus swimming motility were developed."
https://openalex.org/W4221095550,"Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) cause subarachnoid hemorrhage, which has high rates of mortality and morbidity when ruptured. Recently, the role of rare variants in the genetic background of complex diseases has been increasingly recognized. The aim of this study was to identify rare variants for susceptibility to IA.Whole-exome sequencing was performed on seven members of a Japanese pedigree with highly aggregated IA. Candidate genes harboring co-segregating rare variants with IA were re-sequenced and tested for association with IA using additional 500 probands and 323 non-IA controls. Functional analysis of rare variants detected in the pedigree was also conducted.We identified two gene variants shared among all four affected participants in the pedigree. One was the splicing donor c.1515+1G>A variant in NPNT (Nephronectin), which was confirmed to cause aberrant splicing by a minigene assay. The other was the missense p.P83T variant in CBY2 (Chibby family member 2). Overexpression of p.P83T CBY2 fused with red fluorescent protein tended to aggregate in the cytoplasm. Although Nephronectin has been previously reported to be involved in endothelial angiogenic functions, CBY2 is a novel molecule in terms of vascular pathophysiology. We confirmed that CBY2 was expressed in cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells in an isoform2-specific manner. Targeted CBY2 re-sequencing in additional case-control samples identified three deleterious rare variants (p.R46H, p.P83T, and p.L183R) in seven probands, showing a significant enrichment in the overall probands (8/501) compared to the controls (0/323) (p = 0.026, Fisher's extract test).NPNT and CBY2 were identified as novel susceptibility genes for IA. The highly heterogeneous and polygenic architecture of IA susceptibility can be uncovered by accumulating extensive analyses that focus on each pedigree with a high incidence of IA."
