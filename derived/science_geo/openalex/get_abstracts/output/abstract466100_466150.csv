https://openalex.org/W2113487278,"Climate change will have far-reaching impacts on biodiversity, including increasing extinction rates. Current approaches to quantifying such impacts focus on measuring exposure to climatic change and largely ignore the biological differences between species that may significantly increase or reduce their vulnerability. To address this, we present a framework for assessing three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, namely sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity; this draws on species' biological traits and their modeled exposure to projected climatic changes. In the largest such assessment to date, we applied this approach to each of the world's birds, amphibians and corals (16,857 species). The resulting assessments identify the species with greatest relative vulnerability to climate change and the geographic areas in which they are concentrated, including the Amazon basin for amphibians and birds, and the central Indo-west Pacific (Coral Triangle) for corals. We found that high concentration areas for species with traits conferring highest sensitivity and lowest adaptive capacity differ from those of highly exposed species, and we identify areas where exposure-based assessments alone may over or under-estimate climate change impacts. We found that 608-851 bird (6-9%), 670-933 amphibian (11-15%), and 47-73 coral species (6-9%) are both highly climate change vulnerable and already threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List. The remaining highly climate change vulnerable species represent new priorities for conservation. Fewer species are highly climate change vulnerable under lower IPCC SRES emissions scenarios, indicating that reducing greenhouse emissions will reduce climate change driven extinctions. Our study answers the growing call for a more biologically and ecologically inclusive approach to assessing climate change vulnerability. By facilitating independent assessment of the three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, our approach can be used to devise species and area-specific conservation interventions and indices. The priorities we identify will strengthen global strategies to mitigate climate change impacts."

However, a viable mechanism responsible for the widespread acetylation in mitochondria remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the physiologic pH and acyl-CoA concentrations of the mitochondrial matrix are sufficient to cause dose- and time-dependent, but enzyme-independent acetylation and succinylation of mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial proteins in vitro. These data suggest that protein acylation in mitochondria may be a chemical event facilitated by the alkaline pH and high concentrations of reactive acyl-CoAs present in the mitochondrial matrix. Although these results do not exclude the possibility of enzyme-mediated protein acylation in mitochondria, they demonstrate that such a mechanism may not be required in its unique chemical environment. These findings may have implications for the evolutionary roles that the mitochondria-localized SIRT3 deacetylase and SIRT5 desuccinylase have in the maintenance of metabolic health."

Vanholme et al. (p. 1103 , published online 15 August; see the cover) have identified a new step in the biosynthetic pathway of lignin in Arabidopsis in which caffeoyl shikimate esterase catalyzes synthesis of caffeate. Cellulose from mutant plants, which had reduced amounts of lignin, was more efficiently processed into glucose."

It has been proposed that dopamine deficiency exacerbates obesity by provoking compensatory overfeeding as one way to restore reward sensitivity. However, the physiological mechanisms linking prolonged high-fat intake to dopamine deficiency remain elusive. We show that administering oleoylethanolamine, a gastrointestinal lipid messenger whose synthesis is suppressed after prolonged high-fat exposure, is sufficient to restore gut-stimulated dopamine release in high-fat-fed mice. Administering oleoylethanolamine to high-fat-fed mice also eliminated motivation deficits during flavorless intragastric feeding and increased oral intake of low-fat emulsions. Our findings suggest that high-fat-induced gastrointestinal dysfunctions play a key role in dopamine deficiency and that restoring gut-generated lipid signaling may increase the reward value of less palatable, yet healthier, foods."
https://openalex.org/W2060713924,"Pluripotency Control The transcription factors Pou5f1/Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog play central roles in pluripotency control in mammalian embryonic stem (ES) cells. The evolution of the pluripotency regulatory network and its roles during early development of nonmammalian vertebrates is unknown. Leichsenring et al. (p. 1005 , published online 15 August) show that in zebrafish embryos, Pou5f1 controls priming and transcriptional activation of the first zygotically expressed genes. This mechanism for transition from the transcriptionally silent cleavage stage to the transcriptionally active blastula stage may have evolved to control the prolonged cell pluripotency state in mammalian early development and ES cells, establishing a link between zygotic gene activation and pluripotency control."
https://openalex.org/W1986176487,"Proteinases and the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are essential for expression of allergic inflammation and diseases such as asthma. A mechanism that links these inflammatory mediators is essential for explaining the fundamental basis of allergic disease but has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that TLR4 is activated by airway proteinase activity to initiate both allergic airway disease and antifungal immunity. These outcomes were induced by proteinase cleavage of the clotting protein fibrinogen, yielding fibrinogen cleavage products that acted as TLR4 ligands on airway epithelial cells and macrophages. Thus, allergic airway inflammation represents an antifungal defensive strategy that is driven by fibrinogen cleavage and TLR4 activation. These findings clarify the molecular basis of allergic disease and suggest new therapeutic strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2013346221,"Draining Through Ice Water formed by surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet is transferred rapidly to the underlying bedrock, but how the water is then dispersed is less clear. This question is important because how the ice-rock interface is lubricated affects how fast the ice sheet moves. Existing conceptual models are based on observations of mountain glaciers, but Meierbachtol et al. (p. 777 ; see the Perspective by Lüthi ) now show that those ideas may not be applicable to the Greenland Ice Sheet. Measuring water pressures in a transect of 23 boreholes revealed that drainage structures differ between the edge, where large melt channels form, and further inland, where more distributed pathways are found."
https://openalex.org/W2089554363,"The MYB proteins comprise one of the largest families of transcription factors (TFs) in plants. Although several MYB genes have been characterized to play roles in secondary metabolism, the MYB family has not yet been identified in apple. In this study, 229 apple MYB genes were identified through a genome-wide analysis and divided into 45 subgroups. A computational analysis was conducted using the apple genomic database to yield a complete overview of the MYB family, including the intron-exon organizations, the sequence features of the MYB DNA-binding domains, the carboxy-terminal motifs, and the chromosomal locations. Subsequently, the expression of 18 MYB genes, including 12 were chosen from stress-related subgroups, while another 6 ones from other subgroups, in response to various abiotic stresses was examined. It was found that several of these MYB genes, particularly MdoMYB121, were induced by multiple stresses. The MdoMYB121 was then further functionally characterized. Its predicted protein was found to be localized in the nucleus. A transgenic analysis indicated that the overexpression of the MdoMYB121 gene remarkably enhanced the tolerance to high salinity, drought, and cold stresses in transgenic tomato and apple plants. Our results indicate that the MYB genes are highly conserved in plant species and that MdoMYB121 can be used as a target gene in genetic engineering approaches to improve the tolerance of plants to multiple abiotic stresses."

Kaproth and Marone (p. 1229 ; published online 15 August) have made laboratory observations of repetitive, slow stick-slip in fault-zone materials and developed a mechanical explanation for how earthquake-like dynamic slip nucleation could start and then arrest so as to produce slow slip. As preseismic slip is a precursor to rupture, temporal variations in elastic wave speeds should be monitored in regions of high seismic hazard."

https://openalex.org/W2095749788,"The utility of species distribution models for applications in invasion and global change biology is critically dependent on their transferability between regions or points in time, respectively. We introduce two methods that aim to improve the transferability of presence-only models: density-based occurrence thinning and performance-based predictor selection. We evaluate the effect of these methods along with the impact of the choice of model complexity and geographic background on the transferability of a species distribution model between geographic regions. Our multifactorial experiment focuses on the notorious invasive seaweed Caulerpa cylindracea (previously Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea) and uses Maxent, a commonly used presence-only modeling technique. We show that model transferability is markedly improved by appropriate predictor selection, with occurrence thinning, model complexity and background choice having relatively minor effects. The data shows that, if available, occurrence records from the native and invaded regions should be combined as this leads to models with high predictive power while reducing the sensitivity to choices made in the modeling process. The inferred distribution model of Caulerpa cylindracea shows the potential for this species to further spread along the coasts of Western Europe, western Africa and the south coast of Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2025110912,"Early Multi Multituberculate mammals (multis) first arose in the Jurassic and became extinct in the Oligocene, a span of over 100 million years, which makes them the longest-living order of mammals known. This highly diverse and abundant group filled many niches occupied by today's similarly diverse rodents. Multis are known for their complex dentition and unique locomotor adaptations, which facilitated their divergence into a suite of ecosystems. Yuan et al. (p. 779 ) describe a new basal multi from a nearly complete skeleton that shows that the underpinnings of these adaptations arose early in the evolution of the order, setting the stage for the major diversification and radiation of the group that came during the Cretaceous and Paleogene."
https://openalex.org/W2036294650,"Breast-feeding is associated with enhanced protection from gastrointestinal disease in infants, mediated in part by an array of bioactive glycan components in milk that act through molecular mechanisms to inhibit enteric pathogen infection. Human milk contains hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan polymer found in virtually all mammalian tissues. We have shown that synthetic HA of a specific size range promotes expression of antimicrobial peptides in intestinal epithelium. We hypothesize that hyaluronan from human milk also enhances innate antimicrobial defense. Here we define the concentration of HA in human milk during the first 6 months postpartum. Importantly, HA isolated from milk has a biological function. Treatment of HT-29 colonic epithelial cells with human milk HA at physiologic concentrations results in time- and dose-dependent induction of the antimicrobial peptide human β-defensin 2 and is abrogated by digestion of milk HA with a specific hyaluronidase. Milk HA induction of human β-defensin 2 expression is also reduced in the presence of a CD44-blocking antibody and is associated with a specific increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting a role for the HA receptor CD44. Furthermore, oral administration of human milk-derived HA to adult, wild-type mice results in induction of the murine Hβ D2 ortholog in intestinal mucosa and is dependent upon both TLR4 and CD44 in vivo. Finally, treatment of cultured colonic epithelial cells with human milk HA enhances resistance to infection by the enteric pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Together, our observations suggest that maternally provided HA stimulates protective antimicrobial defense in the newborn."
https://openalex.org/W2021540900,"Toward Synthetic Biology The detection of an appropriate point to intervene in a cellular pathway and minimize off-target effects on other cellular processes present problems for the design of circuits that control cellular signaling pathways and thus direct cell function. Galloway et al. (p. 1358 , published online 15 August; see the Perspective by Sarkar ) report progress on these challenges in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . A molecular control system was developed to direct the yeast cells to one of three cell fates. To avoid disruption of other cellular controls, exogenous ribozyme-based controllers that interfaced with the endogenous control circuits were used, which avoided genetic alteration to the cells. After enhancing the control circuits with feedback loops to make their behavior more reliable, the circuits were used to modulate the abundance of particular components that acted as critical regulators of yeast cell-fate decisions. This allowed direction of cell fate in response to a chosen chemical stimulus. These strategies may be adaptable to allow similar direction of the physiological state of mammalian cells, for example, to allow therapeutic applications of synthetic biology."

Rat liver nuclei were also shown to be endowed with a FAD pyrophosphatase that hydrolyzes FAD with an optimum at alkaline pH and is significantly inhibited by adenylate-containing nucleotides.

A number of other regulatory processes crucial for cell life and death, among which are ROS production, antioxidant defense, protein folding, and chromatin remodeling, also depend on more than 100 different flavoproteins, 75% of which use FAD as cofactor. Although in the large majority of cases flavoenzymes are oxidoreductases, they can also catalyze non-redox reactions (i.e., transfer, synthesis, isomerization, and ligations) (for reviews see Refs. 4.Macheroux P.

Although bacteria, protists, fungi, plants, and some animals can synthesize Rf, mammals must obtain this water-soluble vitamin from food and, to a lesser extent, from intestinal microflora.

Once in the cell, Rf is converted into the flavin cofactor FAD via the sequential action of riboflavin kinase (ATP:riboflavin 5′ phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.26), which transfers a phosphoryl group from ATP to Rf to form FMN, and FAD synthase, previously known as FAD synthetase (FADS; ATP:FMN adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.2), the enzyme responsible for FMN adenylation to FAD. In mammals, riboflavin kinase and FADS are two distinct monofunctional enzymes that have been purified from rat tissues and biochemically characterized (13.McCormick D.B. Oka M. Bowers-Komro D.M.

Our hypothesis was that different FADS isoforms with compartment-specific functions may exist in eukaryote stems from the cloning and functional characterization of two products of the human FADS gene (FLAD1), namely transcript variants 1 (hFADS1) and 2 (hFADS2) (24.Brizio C.

The two corresponding protein products were shown to differ for an extra sequence of 97 amino acids at the N terminus (present only in hFADS1) containing a putative mitochondrial targeting peptide, as predicted by bioinformatics. Accordingly, a subsequent paper conclusively demonstrated that, in humans, hFADS1 is mitochondrial, whereas hFADS2 is cytosolic (23.Torchetti E.M. Brizio C. Colella M. Galluccio M. Giancaspero T.A.

Recently, two additional splicing variants for the FLAD1 gene have been deposited in the NCBI Entrez Gene database (gene identifier 80308), namely transcript variants 3 and 4, whose simultaneous presence with hFADS1 has been observed at the transcriptional level in the intestinal HT-29 cell line (8.Barile M.

The possibility of other subcellular localizations, different from cytosol and mitochondria, has not been excluded by the available studies. In fact, in two recent papers, a plasma membrane localization in neuronal cells (26.Lin J. Diamanduros A. Chowdhury S.A. Scelsa S. Latov N. Sadiq S.A.

In this paper, by confocal microscopy and immunoblotting approaches, we show for the first time the nuclear localization of FADS in different experimental rat models.

Separation was achieved by means of a Gilson HPLC system including a model 306 pump and a model 307 pump equipped with a FP-2020 Plus Jasco fluorescence detector and a Unipoint system software. Quantitative determination of Rf, FMN, and FAD was carried out using a calibration curve made in each experiment by using standard solutions diluted in the extraction solution. Detergent-solubilized or ultrafiltered nuclei (0.1–0.2 mg) were preincubated at 37 °C in 100 μl of a medium consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μm FMN, and 5 mm ATP; where indicated, either 5 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm EDTA was added.

Briefly, the amount of synthesized FAD was determined by revealing the reconstituted holo-d-amino acid oxidase activity derived from FAD binding to the apo-d-amino acid oxidase, using 25 mm d-alanine as substrate. NADH oxidation in the l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-coupled reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm, and the rate was calculated by measuring the slope of the tangent to the initial part of the experimental curve. This rate was proven to be proportional to FAD concentration. Calibration curves were obtained by using standard FAD solutions, and corrections were also made to account for the inhibition caused by FMN and ATP added to the reconstitution assay.

Reliable methods to identify the infectious diseases of humans and animals and that are most likely to be influenced by climate are therefore required. Since different priorities will affect the decision to address a particular pathogen threat, decision makers need a standardised method of prioritisation. Ranking methods and Multi-Criteria Decision approaches provide such a standardised method and were employed here to design two different pathogen prioritisation tools. The opinion of 64 experts was elicited to assess the importance of 40 criteria that could be used to prioritise emerging infectious diseases of humans and animals in Canada. A weight was calculated for each criterion according to the expert opinion. Attributes were defined for each criterion as a transparent and repeatable method of measurement. Two different Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis tools were tested, both of which used an additive aggregation approach. These were an Excel spreadsheet tool and a tool developed in software ‘M-MACBETH’. The tools were trialed on nine ‘test’ pathogens. Two different methods of criteria weighting were compared, one using fixed weighting values, the other using probability distributions to account for uncertainty and variation in expert opinion. The ranking of the nine pathogens varied according to the weighting method that was used. In both tools, using both weighting methods, the diseases that tended to rank the highest were West Nile virus, Giardiasis and Chagas, while Coccidioidomycosis tended to rank the lowest. Both tools are a simple and user friendly approach to prioritising pathogens according to climate change by including explicit scoring of 40 criteria and incorporating weighting methods based on expert opinion. They provide a dynamic interactive method that can help to identify pathogens for which a full risk assessment should be pursued."
https://openalex.org/W2033355502,"It has been reported that Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the roles of ANXA2 in the migration and invasion of HCC cells have not been determined. In this study, we found that ANXA2-specific siRNA (si-ANXA2) significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells co-cultured with fibroblasts in vitro. In addition, the production of MMP-2 by fibroblasts cultured in supernatant collected from si-ANXA2-transfected HCC cells was notably down-regulated. ANXA2 was also found to be co-localized and co-immunoprecipitated with CD147. Further investigation revealed that the expression of ANXA2 in HCC cells affected the shedding of CD147-harboring membrane microvesicles, acting as a vehicle for CD147 in tumor-stromal interactions and thereby regulating the production of MMP-2 by fibroblasts. Together, these results suggest that ANXA2 enhances the migration and invasion potential of HCC cells in vitro by regulating the trafficking of CD147-harboring membrane microvesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2068461971,"Canyon incision into mountain topography is commonly used as a proxy for surface uplift driven by tectonic or geodynamic processes, but climatic changes can also instigate incision. The ~1250-kilometer (km)-long eastern margin of the Andean Plateau hosts a series of 1.5- to 2.5-km-deep canyons that cross major deformation zones. Using (U-Th)/He thermochronology, we document a transition from Miocene faulting to Pliocene canyon incision across the northeastern plateau margin. Regionally, widespread Pliocene incision into the eastern plateau margin is concurrent with a shift in global climate from early Pliocene warmth to late Pliocene cooling. Enhanced moisture transport onto the Andean Plateau driven by sea surface temperature changes during cooling is the likely pacemaker for canyon incision."
https://openalex.org/W1971722897,"Biogenesis of mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster proteins requires the interaction of multiple proteins with the highly conserved 14-kDa scaffold protein Isu, on which clusters are built prior to their transfer to recipient proteins. For example, the assembly process requires the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1, which serves as the sulfur donor for cluster assembly. The transfer process requires Jac1, a J-protein Hsp70 cochaperone. We recently identified three residues on the surface of Jac1 that form a hydrophobic patch critical for interaction with Isu. The results of molecular modeling of the Isu1-Jac1 interaction, which was guided by these experimental data and structural/biophysical information available for bacterial homologs, predicted the importance of three hydrophobic residues forming a patch on the surface of Isu1 for interaction with Jac1. Using Isu variants having alterations in residues that form the hydrophobic patch on the surface of Isu, this prediction was experimentally validated by in vitro binding assays. In addition, Nfs1 was found to require the same hydrophobic residues of Isu for binding, as does Jac1, suggesting that Jac1 and Nfs1 binding is mutually exclusive. In support of this conclusion, Jac1 and Nfs1 compete for binding to Isu. Evolutionary analysis revealed that residues involved in these interactions are conserved and that they are critical residues for the biogenesis of Fe/S cluster protein in vivo. We propose that competition between Jac1 and Nfs1 for Isu binding plays an important role in transitioning the Fe/S cluster biogenesis machinery from the cluster assembly step to the Hsp70-mediated transfer of the Fe/S cluster to recipient proteins."

Understanding how smooth muscle gene expression is regulated in these different phenotypic states is critical for unraveling the pathogenesis of these diseases. In the current study we examined the specific roles of Foxf1 in visceral SMC differentiation. Data show that Foxf1 is specifically required for expression of several contractile and regulatory proteins such as telokin, smooth muscle γ-actin, and Cav1.2b in visceral SMCs. Mechanistically, Foxf1 directly binds to and activates the telokin promoter. Foxf1 also directly binds to serum response factor (SRF) and myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs). Unlike Foxo4 and Foxq1, which bind to MRTFs and block their interaction with SRF, Foxf1 acts synergistically with these proteins to regulate telokin expression. Knock-out of Foxf1 specifically in SMCs results in neonatal lethality, with mice exhibiting GI tract abnormalities. Mice heterozygous for Foxf1 in SMC exhibited impaired colonic contractility and decreased expression of contractile proteins. These studies together with previous studies, suggest that different forkhead proteins can regulate gene expression in SMCs through modulating the activity of the SRF-myocardin axis to either promote or inhibit differentiation and proliferation thereby altering gastrointestinal contractility and development.

https://openalex.org/W2018585328,"Narcolepsy cataplexy syndrome, characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, is strongly associated with a genetic marker, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1*06:02. A sudden increase in the incidence of childhood narcolepsy was observed after vaccination with AS03-adjuvanted Pandemrix influenza vaccine in Finland at the beginning of 2010. Here, we analysed whether the coinciding influenza A H1N1pdm pandemic contributed, together with the Pandemrix vaccination, to the increased incidence of childhood narcolepsy in 2010. The analysis was based on the presence or absence of antibody response against non-structural protein 1 (NS1) from H1N1pdm09 virus, which was not a component of Pandemrix vaccine.Non-structural (NS) 1 proteins from recombinant influenza A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) and influenza A/Finland/554/09 (H1N1pdm09) viruses were purified and used in Western blot analysis to determine specific antibody responses in human sera. The sera were obtained from 45 patients who fell ill with narcolepsy after vaccination with AS03-adjuvanted Pandemrix at the end of 2009, and from controls.Based on quantitative Western blot analysis, only two of the 45 (4.4%) Pandemrix-vaccinated narcoleptic patients showed specific antibody response against the NS1 protein from the H1N1pdm09 virus, indicating past infection with the H1N1pdm09 virus. Instead, paired serum samples from patients, who suffered from a laboratory confirmed H1N1pdm09 infection, showed high levels or diagnostic rises (96%) in H1N1pdm virus NS1-specific antibodies and very high cross-reactivity to H3N2 subtype influenza A virus NS1 protein.Based on our findings, it is unlikely that H1N1pdm09 virus infection contributed to a sudden increase in the incidence of childhood narcolepsy observed in Finland in 2010 after AS03-adjuvanted Pandemrix vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2050987661,"The small G protein Rap1 can mediate ""inside-out signaling"" by recruiting effectors to the plasma membrane that signal to pathways involved in cell adhesion and cell migration. This action relies on the membrane association of Rap1, which is dictated by post-translational prenylation as well as by a stretch of basic residues within its carboxyl terminus. One feature of this stretch of acidic residues is that it lies adjacent to a functional phosphorylation site for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA. This phosphorylation has two effects on Rap1 action. One, it decreases the level of Rap1 activity as measured by GTP loading and the coupling of Rap1 to RapL, a Rap1 effector that couples Rap1 GTP loading to integrin activation. Two, it destabilizes the membrane localization of Rap1, promoting its translocation into the cytoplasm. These two actions, decreased GTP loading and decreased membrane localization, are related, as the translocation of Rap1-GTP into the cytoplasm is associated with its increased GTP hydrolysis and inactivation. The consequences of this phosphorylation in Rap1-dependent cell adhesion and cell migration were also examined. Active Rap1 mutants that lack this phosphorylation site had a minimal effect on cell adhesion but strongly reduced cell migration, when compared with an active Rap1 mutant that retained the phosphorylation site. This suggests that optimal cell migration is associated with cycles of Rap1 activation, membrane egress, and inactivation, and requires the regulated phosphorylation of Rap1 by PKA."
https://openalex.org/W1983999879,"The complex process of allopolyploid speciation includes various mechanisms ranging from species crosses and hybrid genome doubling to genome alterations and the establishment of new allopolyploids as persisting natural entities. Currently, little is known about the genetic mechanisms that underlie hybrid genome doubling, despite the fact that natural allopolyploid formation is highly dependent on this phenomenon. We examined the genetic basis for the spontaneous genome doubling of triploid F1 hybrids between the direct ancestors of allohexaploid common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., AABBDD genome), namely Triticum turgidum L. (AABB genome) and Aegilops tauschii Coss. (DD genome). An Ae. tauschii intraspecific lineage that is closely related to the D genome of common wheat was identified by population-based analysis. Two representative accessions, one that produces a high-genome-doubling-frequency hybrid when crossed with a T. turgidum cultivar and the other that produces a low-genome-doubling-frequency hybrid with the same cultivar, were chosen from that lineage for further analyses. A series of investigations including fertility analysis, immunostaining, and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis showed that (1) production of functional unreduced gametes through nonreductional meiosis is an early step key to successful hybrid genome doubling, (2) first division restitution is one of the cytological mechanisms that cause meiotic nonreduction during the production of functional male unreduced gametes, and (3) six QTLs in the Ae. tauschii genome, most of which likely regulate nonreductional meiosis and its subsequent gamete production processes, are involved in hybrid genome doubling. Interlineage comparisons of Ae. tauschii’s ability to cause hybrid genome doubling suggested an evolutionary model for the natural variation pattern of the trait in which non-deleterious mutations in six QTLs may have important roles. The findings of this study demonstrated that the genetic mechanisms for hybrid genome doubling could be studied based on the intrinsic natural variation that exists in the parental species."
https://openalex.org/W2054227274,"Background In COPD patients, fatal and non-fatal respiratory-related events are influenced by age, severity of respiratory disease, and comorbidities. Objectives Analyze the effects of edentulism, periodontal disease and systemic biomarkers of inflammation on the occurrence of serious fatal and non-fatal respiratory-related events among subjects with COPD. Methods Cases were identified from Dental Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Edentulism was defined as study participants without any natural teeth or implants. Participants with one or more natural teeth (comprising 11,378 subjects) were studied as dentate subjects. Periodontal disease status among dentate individuals was determined using the consensus definitions published by the joint Center for Disease Control/American Association of Periodontology working group). Adjusted Hazard Models are developed to evaluate the relationship between edentulism/periodontal disease and COPD Related Events. Models were then stratified by GOLD Stage I, II and III/IV. Serum biomarkers were also evaluated to explore the effect of systemic inflammation. Results A statistically significant association was found between oral health status and COPD-related events, even adjusting for conditions such as hypertension, smoking and diabetes. Edentulous individuals who had been diagnosed with COPD had a higher incidence and were at greater risk of having a COPD related event (hospitalization and death) than individuals who had teeth and whose mouths had healthy periodontal status. However, being edentulous did not convey excess risk for COPD-related events for those study participants who were classified as GOLD III/IV at baseline. Finally, we showed that individuals who had levels of serum IL-6 in the highest two quartiles were at even higher risk for COPD-related events. Conclusions These findings suggest that the risk for COPD-related events after adjusting for potential confounders may be attributable to both edentulism and elevated serum IL-6 levels."
https://openalex.org/W2009717417,"Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) to the Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica (JC) pollen is an IgE-mediated type I allergy affecting nasal mucosa. However, the molecular events underlying its development remain unclear. We sought to identify SAR-associated altered gene expression in nasal epithelial cells during natural exposure to JC pollen. We recruited study participants in 2009 and 2010 and collected nasal epithelial cells between February and April, which is the period of natural pollen dispersion. Fifteen patients with SAR-JC and 13 control subjects were enrolled in 2009, and 17 SAR-JC patients, 13 sensitized asymptomatic subjects (Sensitized), and 15 control subjects were enrolled in 2010. Total RNA was extracted from nasal epithelial cells and 8 SAR-JC patients and 6 control subjects in 2009 were subjected to microarray analysis with the Illumina HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChip platform. Allergen-stimulated histamine release was examined in the peripheral blood basophils isolated from patients with SAR. We identified 32 genes with significantly altered expression during allergen exposure. One of these, CST1 encodes the cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin SN. CST1 expression in nasal epithelial cells was significantly upregulated in both the 2009 and 2010 SAR-JC groups compared with the control groups. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the increased expression of CST1 in the nasal epithelial cells of SAR patients.

We found that optimization of the complexation-exchange kinetics is critical for overcoming the barriers imposed by interfacial confinement and accelerating the apparent rate of enzymatic cellulose decomposition. Unraveling enzyme kinetics under interfacial confinement is a core problem of in vivo biology (1.Zhou H.-X. Rivas G. Minton A.P. Macromolecular crowding and confinement: biochemical, biophysical, and potential physiological consequences.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 375-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Progress in this task is severely restrained by the limitation in resolving protein behaviors and their effects on biochemical reactions in heterogeneous environments. Here, we overcame this issue for a very important biocatalyst in the decomposition of cellulose (2.Zhang Y.-H.P. Lynd L.R.

We devised a novel systems-level simulation method that incorporates molecular scale spatial resolution to illuminate the non-classical behaviors in enzyme kinetics due to surface restriction. The capabilities we established for tracking single-enzyme movements during the course of the biochemical reaction allow clear elucidation of the molecular origins that limit the apparent rate of substrate conversion. A comprehensive understanding of the interfacial biocatalysis of TrCel7A can help to identify effective engineering strategies for improving the technologies of cellulose bioconversion (7.Lynd L.R.

Bommarius A.S. Modeling cellulase kinetics on lignocellulosic substrates.Biotech. Adv. 2009; 27: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The enzymes adsorb onto crystalline cellulose microfibrils that are composed of linear glucan chains held tightly together by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions (3.Himmel M.E. Ding S.Y. Johnson D.K. Adney W.S. Nimlos M.R. Brady J.W. Foust T.D. Biomass recalcitrance: engineering plants and enzymes for biofuels production.Science. 2007; 315: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (3442) Google Scholar). On the microfibril surface, an adsorbed enzyme diffuses until it complexes with the free reducing end of a glucan chain (6.Teeri T.T. Crystalline cellulose degradation: new insight into the function of cellobiohydrolases.Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 160-167Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Complexation involves extraction of the targeted chain from the surface and threading of the linear polymer into the active site tunnel of TrCel7A (6.Teeri T.T. Crystalline cellulose degradation: new insight into the function of cellobiohydrolases.Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 160-167Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Once complexed, the enzyme can processively hydrolyze the β1,4-glycosidic linkages within the captured chain and release a cellobiose molecule into solution after each bond cleavage. The consecutive hydrolysis along a single chain stops when the enzyme decomplexes or becomes blocked by surface obstacles (10.Väljamäe P. Sild V. Pettersson G. Johansson G.

In interfacial biocatalysis, the heterogeneous and crowded environments around insoluble substrates can induce complex protein-protein and protein-biomaterial couplings that are difficult to characterize (9.Bansal P. Hall M. Realff M.J. Lee J.H. Bommarius A.S. Modeling cellulase kinetics on lignocellulosic substrates.Biotech. Adv. 2009; 27: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13.Berry H.

Furthermore, as a result of the excluded volume constraints, the displacement of processive TrCel7A enzymes is sensitive to obstacles on the microfibril surface that can cause “traffic jams” of proteins (9.Bansal P. Hall M. Realff M.J. Lee J.H. Bommarius A.S. Modeling cellulase kinetics on lignocellulosic substrates.Biotech. Adv. 2009; 27: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 10.Väljamäe P.

Traffic jams reduce hydrolytic efficiency of cellulase on cellulose surface.Science. 2011; 333: 1279-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Similar issues due to confinement on an extended molecular surface can be found in other systems like motor proteins (14.Leduc C. Padberg-Gehle K. Varga V. Helbing D. Diez S. Howard J. Molecular crowding creates traffic jams of kinesin motors on microtubules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 6100-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In such scenarios, the classical mass-action principles that assume a dilute and well mixed reaction medium become inappropriate (9.Bansal P. Hall M. Realff M.J. Lee J.H. Bommarius A.S. Modeling cellulase kinetics on lignocellulosic substrates.Biotech. Adv. 2009; 27: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13.Berry H. Monte Carlo simulations of enzyme reactions in two dimensions: fractal kinetics and spatial segregation.Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1891-1901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For the case of cellulose decomposition by TrCel7A, we illustrate that spatiotemporal resolution of the enzyme kinetics is essential for uncovering the rate-limiting mechanisms. To understand the effect of spatial confinement on cellulase kinetics, we developed a lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model to simulate the elementary kinetic reactions (see Fig. 1A) of individual cellulases on cellulose microfibrils with a molecular scale spatial resolution. The SLATE model developed here describes the spatiotemporal enzyme reaction network in three dimensions and explicitly tracks the locations of individual enzymes and cellobiose residues. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, each TrCel7A enzyme in the model can perform the following reactions: adsorption, desorption, diffusion, complexation, decomplexation, and hydrolysis. The shapes and sizes of individual TrCel7A enzymes (15.Kraulis J. Clore G.M. Nilges M. Jones T.A. Pettersson G. Knowles J. Gronenborn A.M.

The three-dimensional crystal structure of the catalytic core of cellobiohydrolase I from Trichoderma reesei.Science. 1994; 265: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and microfibril glucan chains were resolved onto a three-dimensional lattice with 5-Å cubic grid cells as shown in Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1. This grid size allowed explicit representation of each glucose residue in the glucan chains of a microfibril (17.Ding S.-Y. Himmel M.E.

B. 2012; 116: 8074-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Excluded volume constraints were imposed between molecules in the system by enforcing that any two entities could not have common lattice sites. The geometry and elementary steps of the system are further described in the supplemental data. According to the structural features of plant cellulose, the simulation model of the microfibril consists of 36 glucan chains (17.Ding S.-Y. Himmel M.E. The maize primary cell wall microfibril: a new model derived from direct visualization.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2006; 54: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) with a degree of polymerization of 1024 glucose residues (2.Zhang Y.-H.P. Lynd L.R. Toward an aggregated understanding of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose: noncomplexed cellulase systems.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 88: 797-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Fig. S1). Formation of the enzyme-substrate complex via the complexation step occurs only at the reducing end of glucan chains due to the specificity of TrCel7A (6.Teeri T.T. Crystalline cellulose degradation: new insight into the function of cellobiohydrolases.Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 160-167Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The average number of TrCel7A enzymes adsorbed on the microfibril is 18. This loading corresponds to a cellulose surface coverage of 25%, which is within the typical range employed in experiments (19.Igarashi K. Wada M. Hori R. Samejima M. Surface density of cellobiohydrolyase on crystalline celluloses. A critical parameter to evaluate enzymatic kinetics at a solid-liquid interface.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2869-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The kMC model requires rate constant data to perform stochastic simulations of the enzyme reaction network. For the steps that have been characterized experimentally, the values employed in the simulation model are shown in Fig. 1B. For the complexation rate constant that is unavailable, the value was calibrated by reproducing the conversion versus time profile of decomposing Avicel by TrCel7A measured by Gusakov et al. (20.Gusakov A.V. Salanovich T.N. Antonov A.I. Ustinov B.B. Okunev O.N. Burlingame R. Emalfarb M. Baez M. Sinitsyn A.P. Design of highly efficient cellulase mixtures for enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2007; 97: 1028-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Details of the rate constants employed in the simulation model are described below. Via this calibration procedure, the desorption rate constant of TrCel7A was estimated to be in the range 1 × 10−3 to 1 × 10−2 s−1, consistent with the values inferred from the bulk measurements of reaction kinetics (21.Linder M. Teeri T.T. The cellulose-binding domain of the major cellobiohydrolase of Trichoderma reesei exhibits true reversibility and a high exchange rate on crystalline cellulose.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12251-12255Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22.Levine S.E. Fox J.M. Clark D.S. Blanch H.W.

Hunt C.G. Zhan H.Y. Kinetics of adsorption, desorption, and re-adsorption of a commercial endoglucanase in lignocellulosic suspensions.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The reference value of the complexation rate constant employed in our SLATE simulations was set to 1 × 10−3 s−1; using the value of 1 × 10−2 s−1 does not alter the resulting conversion profiles by >5%. Next, the adsorption rate constant could be determined by the equilibrium adsorption constant K and system volume V. For TrCel7A adsorbing on Avicel, a representative value for K is 0.28 liters/μmol (2.Zhang Y.-H.P. Lynd L.R. Toward an aggregated understanding of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose: noncomplexed cellulase systems.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 88: 797-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar, 25.Ståhlberg J. Johansson G. Pettersson G. A new model for enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose based on the two-domain structure of cellobiohydrolase I.Nat. Biotechnol. 1991; 9: 286-290Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The volume of the simulation model was then set by ensuring that the cellulose concentration in the system is the same as the concentration used by Gusakov et al. (20.Gusakov A.V. Salanovich T.N. Antonov A.I. Ustinov B.B. Okunev O.N. Burlingame R. Emalfarb M. Baez M. Sinitsyn A.P. Design of highly efficient cellulase mixtures for enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2007; 97: 1028-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), 5 mg/ml. With the values of K and V, the adsorption rate constant was calculated by converting the phenomenological bimolecular adsorption rate of kdK to a first-order association rate constant (26.Gillespie D.T. Stochastic simulation of chemical kinetics.Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2007; 58: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar) as ka = kdK/(VNAV10−6) = 8.9 × 10−4 s−1. The factor of NAV10−6 was used to convert μmol in K to number of molecules, and NAV is Avogadro's number. The surface diffusion rate constant is related to the self-diffusion coefficient DS from random walk theory as kdiff = 4DS/lh2, where lh = 1 nm is the hopping distance (27.Smit B. Maesen T.L.M. Molecular simulations of zeolites: adsorption, diffusion, and shape selectivity.Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 4125-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). With the experimentally measured diffusion constant of 1 × 10−10 cm2/s (28.Jervis E.J. Haynes C.A. Kilburn D.G. Surface diffusion of cellulases and their isolated binding domains on cellulose.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24016-24023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the resulting diffusion rate constant is 1 × 104 s−1. The hydrolysis rate was determined from the processive speed of TrCel7A of 7.1 nm/s (12.Igarashi K. Uchihashi T. Koivula A. Wada M. Kimura S. Okamoto T. Penttilä M. Ando T. Samejima M. Traffic jams reduce hydrolytic efficiency of cellulase on cellulose surface.Science. 2011; 333: 1279-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Because a cellobiose unit is ∼1 nm long, the corresponding hydrolysis rate was thus set to 7.1 s−1. The decomplexation rate constant was estimated to be ∼1 × 10−3 to 1 × 10−2 s−1 from bulk kinetic measurements (29.Maurer S.A. Bedbrook C.N. Radke C.J.

Chem. 2012; 287: 18451-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), this rate is lumped together with desorption. The reference value for the SLATE model was set to be 1 × 10−3 s−1 and was extensively varied in different simulations to account for the uncertainty. As mentioned above, the complexation rate constant is difficult to measure directly. A common idea obtained based on the inference from indirect kinetic data is that the value is much lower than that of the hydrolysis reaction (29.Maurer S.A. Bedbrook C.N. Radke C.J.

Initial- and processive-cut products reveal cellobiohydrolase rate limitations and the role of companion enzymes.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 442-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Another feature of the reference conversion profile (20.Gusakov A.V. Salanovich T.N. Antonov A.I. Ustinov B.B. Okunev O.N. Burlingame R. Emalfarb M. Baez M. Sinitsyn A.P. Design of highly efficient cellulase mixtures for enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2007; 97: 1028-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) that we employed for calibrating the complexation rate constant is a rapid decline with time. Therefore, we employed two complexation rate constants in the SLATE model to quantitatively capture this behavior. In the initial microfibril at the start of a SLATE simulation, we assumed that the glucan chains in the solvent-exposed surfaces of the top and bottom layers are more loosely packed. The complexation rate constant of TrCel7A with the glucan chains on these surfaces was thus set to be 10 times faster than that of complexation with the originally buried chains. Recalcitrance of cellulose toward enzymatic decomposition would then increase with time in the SLATE simulation, leading to rapid retardation in the apparent reaction rate (9.Bansal P. Hall M. Realff M.J. Lee J.H. Bommarius A.S. Modeling cellulase kinetics on lignocellulosic substrates.Biotech. Adv. 2009; 27: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). With a single microfibril in the simulation model, this treatment also builds in structural heterogeneity in the material effectively (2.Zhang Y.-H.P. Lynd L.R. Toward an aggregated understanding of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose: noncomplexed cellulase systems.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 88: 797-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar, 9.Bansal P. Hall M. Realff M.J. Lee J.H. Bommarius A.S. Modeling cellulase kinetics on lignocellulosic substrates.Biotech. Adv. 2009; 27: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The best fit values for the fast and slow complexation rates are 5.5 × 10−3 and 5.5 × 10−4 s−1, respectively. In the main text, the faster value is referenced and shown in Fig. 1B. The mechanistic trends and rate-limiting behaviors identified in this work do not depend on whether one or two complexation rate constants were used (data not shown). Moreover, in the reference kinetic data (20.Gusakov A.V. Salanovich T.N. Antonov A.I. Ustinov B.B. Okunev O.N. Burlingame R. Emalfarb M. Baez M. Sinitsyn A.P. Design of highly efficient cellulase mixtures for enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2007; 97: 1028-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) used to calibrate the complexation rate constant, the substrate is Avicel, which is composed of aggregated microfibrils. In contrast, the simulation model contains a single microfibril and hence overestimates the solvent-exposed surface area, i.e. 293 versus 2.38 m2/g (35.Hong J. Ye X. Zhang Y.-H. Quantitative determination of cellulose accessibility to cellulase based on adsorption of a nonhydrolytic fusion protein containing CBM and GFP with its applications.Langmuir. 2007; 23: 12535-12540Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). As a result, by using an enzyme surface coverage within the experimental range (19.Igarashi K. Wada M. Hori R. Samejima M. Surface density of cellobiohydrolyase on crystalline celluloses. A critical parameter to evaluate enzymatic kinetics at a solid-liquid interface.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2869-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the enzyme/substrate mass ratio in the SLATE model is thus higher than those in experiments. To investigate the potential impact on underestimating the complexation rate constant with a higher enzyme loading, we performed simulations at lower enzyme loadings and estimated that a 100-fold reduction would yield a best fit complexation rate constant ∼0.1 s−1. As this value is still >2 orders of magnitude lower than the rate constant of hydrolysis, the result of complexation as the rate-limiting step does not depend on using surface coverage or enzyme loading as the basis to calibrate the simulation model. Because enzymatic cellulose decomposition is an interfacial process, we opted to use surface coverage instead of enzyme loading to connect with experimental results quantitatively. The simulation engine of the three-dimensional SLATE model for enzymatic cellulose decomposition is a lattice kMC scheme (36.Chatterjee A. Vlachos D.G. An overview of spatial microscopic and accelerated kinetic Monte Carlo methods.J. Comput. Aided Mater. Des. 2007; 14: 253-308Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This algorithm was used to simulate the elementary kinetic reactions listed in Fig. 1A for all enzymes in the system. kMC-based simulation models have been used to represent the kinetics of surface phenomena in many areas such as heterogeneous catalysis (36.Chatterjee A. Vlachos D.G. An overview of spatial microscopic and accelerated kinetic Monte Carlo methods.J. Comput. Aided Mater.

Because enzymatic cellulose decomposition occurs at material surfaces, we adopted kMC to model this process. The kMC framework was also adopted here to eliminate the limitations of kinetic modeling of enzymatic cellulose conversion. In this regard, key assumptions of elementary steps such as the complexation and decomplexation steps occurri"
https://openalex.org/W2083132401,"Microglossia is a congenital birth defect in humans and adversely impacts quality of life. In vertebrates, tongue muscle derives from the cranial mesoderm, whereas tendons and connective tissues in the craniofacial region originate from cranial neural crest (CNC) cells. Loss of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) type II receptor in CNC cells in mice (Tgfbr2(fl/fl);Wnt1-Cre) causes microglossia due to a failure of cell-cell communication between cranial mesoderm and CNC cells during tongue development. However, it is still unclear how TGFβ signaling in CNC cells regulates the fate of mesoderm-derived myoblasts during tongue development. Here we show that activation of the cytoplasmic and nuclear tyrosine kinase 1 (ABL1) cascade in Tgfbr2(fl/fl);Wnt1-Cre mice results in a failure of CNC-derived cell differentiation followed by a disruption of TGFβ-mediated induction of growth factors and reduction of myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation activities. Among the affected growth factors, the addition of fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) and neutralizing antibody for follistatin (FST; an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)) could most efficiently restore cell proliferation, differentiation, and organization of muscle cells in the tongue of Tgfbr2(fl/fl);Wnt1-Cre mice. Thus, our data indicate that CNC-derived fibroblasts regulate the fate of mesoderm-derived myoblasts through TGFβ-mediated regulation of FGF and BMP signaling during tongue development."
https://openalex.org/W2132587742,"Glioblastomas are the most aggressive forms of primary brain tumors due to their tendency to invade surrounding healthy brain tissues, rendering them largely incurable. The water channel protein, Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a key molecule for maintaining water and ion homeostasis in the central nervous system and has recently been reported with cell survival except for its well-known function in brain edema. An increased AQP4 expression has been demonstrated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), suggesting it is also involved in malignant brain tumors. In this study, we show that siRNA-mediated down regulation of AQP4 induced glioblastoma cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. We further show that several apoptotic key proteins, Cytochrome C, Bcl-2 and Bad are involved in AQP4 signaling pathways. Our results indicate that AQP4 may serve as an anti-apoptosis target for therapy of glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2006176835,"The role of Group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α) activation in regulating macrophage transcriptional responses to Candida albicans infection was investigated. cPLA2α releases arachidonic acid for the production of eicosanoids. In mouse resident peritoneal macrophages, prostacyclin, prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene C4 were produced within minutes of C. albicans addition before cyclooxygenase 2 expression. The production of TNFα was lower in C. albicans-stimulated cPLA2α+/+ than cPLA2α-/- macrophages due to an autocrine effect of prostaglandins that increased cAMP to a greater extent in cPLA2α+/+ than cPLA2α-/- macrophages. For global insight, differential gene expression in C. albicans-stimulated cPLA2α+/+ and cPLA2α-/- macrophages (3 h) was compared by microarray. cPLA2α+/+ macrophages expressed 86 genes at lower levels and 181 genes at higher levels than cPLA2α-/- macrophages (≥2-fold, p<0.05). Several pro-inflammatory genes were expressed at lower levels (Tnfα, Cx3cl1, Cd40, Ccl5, Csf1, Edn1, CxCr7, Irf1, Irf4, Akna, Ifnγ, several IFNγ-inducible GTPases). Genes that dampen inflammation (Socs3, Il10, Crem, Stat3, Thbd, Thbs1, Abca1) and genes involved in host defense (Gja1, Csf3, Trem1, Hdc) were expressed at higher levels in cPLA2α+/+ macrophages. Representative genes expressed lower in cPLA2α+/+ macrophages (Tnfα, Csf1) were increased by treatment with a prostacyclin receptor antagonist and protein kinase A inhibitor, whereas genes expressed at higher levels (Crem, Nr4a2, Il10, Csf3) were suppressed. The results suggest that C. albicans stimulates an autocrine loop in macrophages involving cPLA2α, cyclooxygenase 1-derived prostaglandins and increased cAMP that globally effects expression of genes involved in host defense and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2081518479,"Controlled conversion of leaf starch to sucrose at night is essential for the normal growth of Arabidopsis. The conversion involves the cytosolic metabolism of maltose to hexose phosphates via an unusual, multidomain protein with 4-glucanotransferase activity, DPE2, believed to transfer glucosyl moieties to a complex heteroglycan prior to their conversion to hexose phosphate via a cytosolic phosphorylase. The significance of this complex pathway is unclear; conversion of maltose to hexose phosphate in bacteria proceeds via a more typical 4-glucanotransferase that does not require a heteroglycan acceptor. It has recently been suggested that DPE2 generates a heterogeneous series of terminal glucan chains on the heteroglycan that acts as a ""glucosyl buffer"" to ensure a constant rate of sucrose synthesis in the leaf at night. Alternatively, DPE2 and/or the heteroglycan may have specific properties important for their function in the plant. To distinguish between these ideas, we compared the properties of DPE2 with those of the Escherichia coli glucanotransferase MalQ. We found that MalQ cannot use the plant heteroglycan as an acceptor for glucosyl transfer. However, experimental and modeling approaches suggested that it can potentially generate a glucosyl buffer between maltose and hexose phosphate because, unlike DPE2, it can generate polydisperse malto-oligosaccharides from maltose. Consistent with this suggestion, MalQ is capable of restoring an essentially wild-type phenotype when expressed in mutant Arabidopsis plants lacking DPE2. In light of these findings, we discuss the possible evolutionary origins of the complex DPE2-heteroglycan pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2152451852,"Background The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is working to introduce new graphic warning labels for cigarette packages, the first change in cigarette warnings in more than 25 years. We sought to examine whether warnings discouraged participants from wanting to smoke and altered perceived likelihood of harms among adolescent males and whether these warning effects varied by age. Methods A national sample of 386 non-smoking American males ages 11–17 participated in an online experiment during fall 2010. We randomly assigned participants to view warnings using a 2×2 between-subjects design. The warnings described a harm of smoking (addiction or lung cancer) using text only or text plus an image used on European cigarette package warnings. Analyses tested whether age moderated the warnings' impact on risk perceptions and smoking motivations. Results The warnings discouraged most adolescents from wanting to smoke, but lung cancer warnings discouraged them more than addiction warnings did (60% vs. 34% were “very much” discouraged, p<.001). Including an image had no effect on discouragement. The warnings affected several beliefs about the harms from smoking, and age moderated these effects. Adolescents said addiction was easier to imagine and more likely to happen to them than lung cancer. They also believed that their true likelihood of experiencing any harm was lower than what an expert would say. Conclusions Our findings suggest that warnings focusing on lung cancer, rather than addiction, are more likely to discourage wanting to smoke among adolescent males and enhance their ability to imagine the harmful consequences of smoking. Including images on warnings had little effect on non-smoking male adolescents' discouragement or beliefs, though additional research on the effects of pictorial warnings for this at-risk population is needed as the FDA moves forward with developing new graphic labels."

In this study, we first established an anti-prefoldin monoclonal antibody that recognizes the prefoldin complex but not its subunits. Using this antibody, it was found that prefoldin was localized in the cytoplasm with dots in co-localization with polyubiquitinated proteins and that the number and strength of dots were increased in cells that had been treated with lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor, and thapsigargin, an inducer of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Knockdown of prefoldin increased the level of SDS-insoluble ubiquitinated protein and reduced cell viability in lactacystin and thapsigargin-treated cells.

https://openalex.org/W2091460793,"Treatment outcomes of HIV patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Rwanda are scarcely documented. HIV viral load (VL) and HIV drug-resistance (HIVDR) outcomes at month 12 were determined in a prospective cohort study of antiretroviral–naïve HIV patients initiating first-line therapy in Kigali. Treatment response was monitored clinically and by regular CD4 counts and targeted HIV viral load (VL) to confirm drug failure. VL measurements and HIVDR genotyping were performed retrospectively on baseline and month 12 samples. One hundred and fifty-eight participants who completed their month 12 follow-up visit had VL data available at month 12. Most of them (88%) were virologically suppressed (VL≤1000 copies/mL) but 18 had virological failure (11%), which is in the range of WHO-suggested targets for HIVDR prevention. If only CD4 criteria had been used to classify treatment response, 26% of the participants would have been misclassified as treatment failure. Pre-therapy HIVDR was documented in 4 of 109 participants (3.6%) with an HIVDR genotyping results at baseline. Eight of 12 participants (66.7%) with virological failure and HIVDR genotyping results at month 12 were found to harbor mutation(s), mostly NNRTI resistance mutations, whereas 4 patients had no HIVDR mutations. Almost half (44%) of the participants initiated ART at CD4 count ≤200cell/µl and severe CD4 depletion at baseline (<50 cells/µl) was associated with virological treatment failure (p = 0.008). Although the findings may not be generalizable to all HIV patients in Rwanda, our data suggest that first-line ART regimen changes are currently not warranted. However, the accumulation of acquired HIVDR mutations in some participants underscores the need to reinforce HIVDR prevention strategies, such as increasing the availability and appropriate use of VL testing to monitor ART response, ensuring high quality adherence counseling, and promoting earlier identification of HIV patients and enrollment into HIV care and treatment programs."
https://openalex.org/W1999113688,"Any defects in the correct formation of the mitotic spindle will lead to chromosomal segregation errors, mitotic arrest, or aneuploidy. We demonstrate that O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), a post-translational modification of serine and threonine residues in nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, regulates spindle function. In O-GlcNAc transferase or O-GlcNAcase gain of function cells, the mitotic spindle is incorrectly assembled. Chromosome condensation and centrosome assembly is impaired in these cells. The disruption in spindle architecture is due to a reduction in histone H3 phosphorylation by Aurora kinase B. However, gain of function cells treated with the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor Thiamet-G restored the assembly of the spindle and partially rescued histone phosphorylation. Together, these data suggest that the coordinated addition and removal of O-GlcNAc, termed O-GlcNAc cycling, regulates mitotic spindle organization and provides a potential new perspective on how O-GlcNAc regulates cellular events."
https://openalex.org/W1987127446,"Preterm birth is associated with a high prevalence of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Non-invasive techniques which can probe the neural correlates underpinning these deficits are required. This can be achieved by measuring the structural network of connections within the preterm infant's brain using diffusion MRI and tractography. We used diffusion MRI and T2 relaxometry to identify connections with altered white matter properties in preterm infants compared to term infants. Diffusion and T2 data were obtained from 9 term neonates and 18 preterm-born infants (born <32 weeks gestational age) at term equivalent age. Probabilistic tractography incorporating multiple fibre orientations was used in combination with the Johns Hopkins neonatal brain atlas to calculate the structural network of connections. Connections of altered diffusivity or T2, as well as their relationship with gestational age at birth and postmenstrual age at the time of MRI, were identified using the network based statistic framework. A total of 433 connections were assessed. FA was significantly reduced in 17, and T2 significantly increased in 18 connections in preterm infants, following correction for multiple comparisons. Cortical networks associated with affected connections mainly involved left frontal and temporal cortical areas: regions which are associated with working memory, verbal comprehension and higher cognitive function – deficits which are often observed later in children and adults born preterm. Gestational age at birth correlated with T2, but not diffusion in several connections. We found no association between diffusion or T2 and postmenstrual age at the time of MRI in preterm infants. This study demonstrates that alterations in the structural network of connections can be identified in preterm infants at term equivalent age, and that incorporation of non-diffusion measures such as T2 in the connectome framework provides complementary information for the assessment of brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2070485819,"All known nitrilase superfamily amidase and carbamoylase structures have an additional glutamate that is hydrogen bonded to the catalytic lysine in addition to the Glu, Lys, Cys ""catalytic triad."" In the amidase from Geobacillus pallidus, mutating this glutamate (Glu-142) to a leucine or aspartate renders the enzyme inactive. X-ray crystal structure determination shows that the structural integrity of the enzyme is maintained despite the mutation with the catalytic cysteine (Cys-166), lysine (Lys-134), and glutamate (Glu-59) in positions similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. In the case of the E142L mutant, a chloride ion is located in the position occupied by Glu-142 O(ε1) in the wild-type enzyme and interacts with the active site lysine. In the case of the E142D mutant, this site is occupied by Asp-142 O(δ1.) In neither case is an atom located at the position of Glu-142 O(ε2) in the wild-type enzyme. The active site cysteine of the E142L mutant was found to form a Michael adduct with acrylamide, which is a substrate of the wild-type enzyme, due to an interaction that places the double bond of the acrylamide rather than the amide carbonyl carbon adjacent to the active site cysteine. Our results demonstrate that in the wild-type active site a crucial role is played by the hydrogen bond between Glu-142 O(ε2) and the substrate amino group in positioning the substrate with the correct stereoelectronic alignment to enable the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon by the catalytic cysteine."
https://openalex.org/W2009430002,"P21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), a serine/threonine protein kinase, modulates many cellular processes by phosphorylating its downstream substrates. In addition to its role in the cytoplasm, PAK1 also affects gene transcription due to its nuclear localization and association with chromatin. It is now recognized that PAK1 kinase activity and its nuclear translocation are rapidly stimulated by ionizing radiation (IR), and that PAK1 activation is a component of the DNA damage response. Owing to the role of PAK1 in the cell survival, its association with the chromatin, and now, stimulation by ionizing radiation, we hypothesize that PAK1 may be contributing to modulation of genes with roles in cellular processes that might be important in the DNA damage response. The purpose of this study was to identify new PAK1 targets in response to ionizing radiation with putative role in the DNA damage response. We examined the effect of IR on the gene expression patterns in the murine embryonic fibroblasts with or without Pak1 using microarray technology. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified using Gene Spring GX 10.0.2. Pathway, network, functional analyses and gene family classification were carried out using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Ingenuity Pathway, Gene Ontology and PANTHER respectively. Selective targets of PAK1 were validated by RT-qPCR. For the first time, we provide a genome-wide analysis of PAK1 and identify its targets with potential roles in the DNA damage response. Gene Ontology analysis identified genes in the IR-stimulated cells that were involved in cell cycle arrest and cell death. Pathway analysis revealed p53 pathway being most influenced by IR responsive, PAK1 targets. Gene family of transcription factors was over represented and gene networks involved in DNA replication, repair and cellular signaling were identified. In brief, this study identifies novel PAK1 dependent IR responsive genes which reveal new aspects of PAK1 biology."
https://openalex.org/W2071927618,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an oncogenic protein that is constitutively activated in numerous cancer cell lines and human cancers. Another STAT family member, STAT1, possesses cancer-inhibitory properties and can promote apoptosis in tumor cells upon activation. To better characterize these important cancer related genes, we tagged STAT3 and STAT1 loci with fluorescent protein (FP) sequences (RFP and GFP respectively) by targeted integration via zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) - mediated homologous recombination in A549 cells that express aberrantly activated STAT3. We inserted the FP transgenes at the N-terminus of the STAT3 locus and at the C-terminus of the STAT1 locus. The integration resulted in endogenous expression of fluorescent STAT3 and STAT1 chimeric fusion proteins. When stimulated with IL-6 or IFN-γ, the cells showed robust nuclear translocation of RFP-STAT3 or STAT1-GFP, respectively. Pre-incubation of cells with a known specific STAT3 inhibitor showed that IFN-γ-induced translocation of STAT1-GFP was not impaired. STAT3 activates multiple downstream targets such as genes involved in cell cycle progression - e.g. cyclin D1. To detect changes in expression of endogenous cyclin D1, we used ZFN technology to insert a secreted luciferase reporter behind the cyclin D1 promoter and separated the luciferase and cyclin D1 coding regions by a 2A sequence to induce a translational skip. The luciferase insertion was made in the RFP-STAT3/STAT1-GFP cell line to have all three reporters in a single cell line. Addition of a STAT3 inhibitor led to suppression of cyclin D1 promoter activity and cell growth arrest. The triple-modified cell line provides a simple and convenient method for high-content screening and pre-clinical testing of potential STAT3 inhibitors in live cells while ensuring that the STAT1 pathway is not affected. This approach of reporting endogenous gene activities using ZFN technology could be applied to other cancer targets."

Lysine acetyltransferases interact with steroid receptors upon binding of an agonist and are recruited to target genes. KDACs have been shown to interact with steroid receptors upon binding to an antagonist. We have shown previously that KDAC inhibitors (KDACis) potently repress the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter through transcriptional mechanisms and impair the ability of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to activate it, suggesting that KDACs can play a positive role in GR transactivation. In the current study, we extended this analysis to the entire GR transcriptome and found that the KDACi valproic acid impairs the ability of agonist-bound GR to activate about 50% of its target genes. This inhibition is largely due to impaired transcription rather than defective GR processing and was also observed using a structurally distinct KDACi. Depletion of KDAC1 expression mimicked the effects of KDACi in over half of the genes found to be impaired in GR transactivation. Simultaneous depletion of KDACs 1 and 2 caused full or partial impairment of several more GR target genes. Altogether we found that Class I KDAC activity facilitates GR-mediated activation at a sizable fraction of GR-activated target genes and that KDAC1 alone or in coordination with KDAC2 is required for efficient GR transactivation at many of these target genes. Finally, our work demonstrates that KDACi exposure has a significant impact on GR signaling and thus has ramifications for the clinical use of these drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2099858250,"Brucella spp. is a species of facultative intracellular Gram-negative bacteria that induces abortion and causes sterility in domesticated mammals and chronic undulant fever in humans. Important determinants of Brucella’s virulence and potential for chronic infection include the ability to circumvent the host cell’s internal surveillance system and the capability to proliferate within dedicated and non-dedicated phagocytes. Hence, identifying genes necessary for intracellular survival may hold the key to understanding Brucella infection. In the present study, microarray analysis reveals that 7.82% (244/3334) of all Brucella abortus genes were up-regulated and 5.4% (180/3334) were down-regulated in RAW264.7 cells, compared to free-living cells in TSB. qRT-PCR verification further confirmed a >5-fold up-regulation for fourteen genes. Functional analysis classified araC, ddp, and eryD as to partake in information storage and processing, alp, flgF and virB9 to be involved in cellular processes, hpcd and aldh to play a role in metabolism, mfs and nikC to be involved in both cellular processes and metabolism, and four hypothetical genes (bruAb1_1814, bruAb1_0475, bruAb1_1926, and bruAb1_0292) had unknown functions. Furthermore, we constructed a B. abortus 2308 mutant Δddp where the ddp gene is deleted in order to evaluate the role of ddp in intracellular survival.

https://openalex.org/W2130619728,"The thalamus has been proposed to play a role in sensory modulation via switching between tonic and burst dual firing of individual neurons. Of the two firing modes, altered burst firing has been repeatedly implicated with pathological pain conditions, which suggests that maintaining a certain form of thalamic burst could be crucial for controlling pain. However, specific elements of burst firing that may contribute to pain control have not yet been actively investigated. Utilizing the deep brain stimulation (DBS) technique, we explored the effects of bursting properties in pain control by electrically stimulating the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus in forms of burst patterned to test different aspects of bursts during the formalin induced nociception in mice. Our results demonstrated that electrical stimulations mimicking specific burst firing properties are important in producing an anti-nociceptive effect and found that the ≤3 ms interval between burst pluses (intra-burst-interval: IntraBI) and ≥3 pulses per burst were required to reliably reduce formalin induced nociceptive responses in mice. Periodicity of IntraBI was also suggested to contribute to anti-nociception to a limited extent."

We investigated how three sexually vulnerable groups for STDs show differences in condom use behaviors (CUBs) depending on their STD infection. Methods The source of data came from the National Survey for STD Prevalence Rate and Sexual Behavior of the High-Risk Sexual Community. The effects of behavioral determinants on CUBs were estimated by using path analysis models. An 11-item questionnaire assessing subjects’ health risk behaviors, sexual beliefs, sexual risk behaviors, and condom use. Results Condom use was higher for men who have sex with men (MSM; n = 108) when they were bisexuals and had high self-efficacy, for Johns (Johns; n = 118) when they had experience of STD infection, and for female sex workers (FSWs; n = 1,083) when they had high self-efficacy, did not engage in drunken sex, and were anxious about infection. Regardless of whether they were infected with STDs, FSWs always used condom when they had high sexual beliefs. On the contrary, Johns exhibited a negative relationship between sexual risk behavior and condom use when they had experience of STD infection. The variable commonly significant to all three groups was the number of sex partners; but it exhibited a positive relationship with MSMs and Johns, and a negative one with FSWs. Conclusions CUBs were related to sexual beliefs as well as sexual risk behavior. At the same time, the experience of STD infection mediated the relationship between the two. Therefore, we need to draw social attention to promote safer sex among STD-vulnerable groups."

We have previously delineated the landscape of DNA methylation in HCC patients unraveling the importance of promoter hypomethylation in activation of cancer- and metastasis-driving genes. The purpose of the present study was to test the feasibility that genes that are hypomethylated in HCC could serve as candidate diagnostic markers. We use high resolution melting analysis (HRM) as a simple translatable PCR-based method to define methylation states in clinical samples. We tested seven regions selected from the shortlist of genes hypomethylated in HCC and showed that HRM analysis of several of them distinguishes methylation states in liver cancer specimens from normal adjacent liver and chronic hepatitis in the Shanghai area. Such regions were identified within promoters of neuronal membrane glycoprotein M6-B (GPM6B) and melanoma antigen family A12 (MAGEA12) genes. Differences in HRM in the immunoglobulin superfamily Fc receptor (FCRL1) separated invasive tumors from less invasive HCC. The identified biomarkers differentiated HCC from chronic hepatitis in another set of samples from Dhaka. Although the main thrust in DNA methylation diagnostics in cancer is on hypermethylated genes, our study for the first time illustrates the potential use of hypomethylated genes as markers for solid tumors. After further validation in a larger cohort, the identified DNA hypomethylated regions can become important candidate biomarkers for liver cancer diagnosis and prognosis, especially in populations with high risk for HCC development."

https://openalex.org/W1999962743,"The ability to differentiate embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into specific cell types is critical for improved regenerative medicine strategies, cancer chemotherapeutic approaches, and regimens to combat chronic diseases associated with aging. Subclasses of motor neurons (MNs) are generated at different positions along the rostrocaudal axis of the spinal cord, and the signals that specify MN subtype fates remain poorly defined. We show here that the cytochrome P450 enzyme Cyp26a1, which metabolizes all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and thereby reduces RA levels, plays a crucial role in specifying MN columnar subtypes. Lack of Cyp26a1 in ESCs during differentiation to spinal MNs increases Aldh1a2 (RALDH2) and Hoxc6, markers of the Hox-dependent, lateral motor column (LMC) subtype identity. In contrast, Lhx3, a marker for median motor column identity, showed lower expression in Cyp26a1(-/-)-derived MNs compared with WT. Without Cyp26a1, an increase in intracellular RA concentration plus sonic hedgehog agonist treatment confer an LMC fate on differentiating MNs. Our data suggest a strategy for increasing LMC-type MNs from ESCs by blocking Cyp26a1 in cell replacement/ESC differentiation therapy to treat neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is prohibited from funding political science, except for grants identified by its director as “promoting national security or the economic interests of the United States.” The High Quality Research Act is being drafted with the aim of guarding against “questionable projects” at NSF. A bill was proposed that would exclude health economics research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Such developments provide cause for concern."
https://openalex.org/W2107271295,"Two theories have emerged for the role that stochasticity plays in biological responses: first, that it degrades biological responses, so the performance of biological signaling machinery could be improved by increasing molecular copy numbers of key proteins; second, that it enhances biological performance, by enabling diversification of population-level responses. Using T cell biology as an example, we demonstrate that these roles for stochastic responses are not sufficient to understand experimental observations of stochastic response in complex biological systems that utilize environmental and genetic diversity to make cooperative responses. We propose a new role for stochastic responses in biology: they enable populations to make complex responses with simpler biochemical signaling machinery than would be required in the absence of stochasticity. Thus, the evolution of stochastic responses may be linked to the evolvability of different signaling machineries."
