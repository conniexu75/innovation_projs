https://openalex.org/W3128416772,"Malnutrition has emerged as one of the major health problems worldwide. Traditional yellow maize has low provitamin-A (proA) content and its genetic base in proA biofortification breeding program of subtropics is extremely narrow. To diversify the proA rich germplasm, 10 elite low proA inbreds were crossed with a proA rich donor (HP702-22) having mutant crtRB1 gene. The F 2 populations derived from these crosses were genotyped using InDel marker specific to crtRB1 . Severe marker segregation distortion was observed. Seventeen crtRB1 inbreds developed through marker-assisted pedigree breeding and seven inbreds generated using marker-assisted backcross breeding were characterized using 77 SSRs. Wide variation in gene diversity (0.08 to 0.79) and dissimilarity coefficient (0.28 to 0.84) was observed. The inbreds were grouped into three major clusters depicting the existing genetic diversity. The crtRB1 -based inbreds possessed high β-carotene (BC: 8.72μg/g), β-cryptoxanthin (BCX: 4.58μg/g) and proA (11.01μg/g), while it was 2.35μg/g, 1.24μg/g and 2.97μg/g in checks, respectively. Based on their genetic relationships, 15 newly developed crtRB1 -based inbreds were crossed with five testers (having crtRB1 gene) using line × tester mating design. 75 experimental hybrids with crtRB1 gene were evaluated over three locations. These experimental hybrids possessed higher BC (8.02μg/g), BCX (4.69μg/g), proA (10.37μg/g) compared to traditional hybrids used as check (BC: 2.36 μg/g, BCX: 1.53μg/g, proA: 3.13μg/g). Environment and genotypes × environment interaction had minor effects on proA content. Both additive and dominance gene action were significant for proA. The mean proportion of proA to total carotenoids (TC) was 44% among crtRB1 -based hybrids, while 11% in traditional hybrids. BC was found to be positively correlated with BCX (r = 0.68) and proA (r = 0.98). However, no correlation was observed between proA and grain yield. Several hybrids with &gt;10.0 t/ha grain yield with proA content &gt;10.0 μg/g were identified. This is the first comprehensive study on development of diverse proA rich maize hybrids through marker-assisted pedigree breeding approach. The findings provides sustainable and cost-effective solution to alleviate vitamin-A deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3128131723,"The income imbalance between urban and rural areas has seriously affected social fairness and justice and has become a key factor restricting the sustainable development of the economy and society. The analysis of the spatiotemporal laws and causes of urban-rural income disparity is of great significance to realizing the coordinated and integrated development of regional urban and rural areas. In this study, the coefficient of variation, Theil decomposition index, spatial autocorrelation method and GeoDetector model were used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of the urban-rural income gap and its driving force in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2000 to 2017. The results show that the per capita disposable income of urban and rural residents in the study area shows a trend of rapid growth from 2000 to 2017. The urban-rural income gap in the study area showed an inverted ""U""-shaped development process as a whole, and the relative difference showed an increasing trend. Regarding the spatial pattern, the study area showed a significant east-west differentiation pattern. The spatial distribution of the urban-rural income gap in the study area has an obvious positive spatial correlation, that is, the phenomena of high-value agglomeration and low-value agglomeration were significant. The economic development level, the industrial structure, the regional development policy, transportation, topographical conditions and resource endowments can strongly explain the spatial differentiation pattern of the urban-rural income gap in the study area. The spatial differentiation pattern of the urban-rural income gap is affected by both natural factors and socioeconomic factors. Among them, socioeconomic factors are the dominant factors, followed by natural factors. There is a significant interaction between natural factors and socio-economic factors, and the combination of socio-economic factors and adverse natural factors can significantly affect the regional urban-rural income gap."
https://openalex.org/W3126513235,"Background The important role of self-efficacy in facilitating health behavior and, in turn, promoting health outcomes has been widely presumed in the theoretical literature. However, little research has focused on the mechanism by which self-care mediates the relationship between symptom-management self-efficacy and quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer patients. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between symptom-management self-efficacy and quality of life in Taiwanese oncology outpatients with breast cancer and then proposes self-care as a mediator between these two factors. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 201 oncology outpatients at one teaching hospital in metropolitan Taipei City, Taiwan. The research instruments included the Symptom-Management Self-Efficacy Scale—Cancer (SMSES-Breast Ca.), the Self-Care Scale, and the European Organization for Research &amp; Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Group Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30). Results Symptom-management self-efficacy (SMSE) was directly associated with the QOL of the participants (β = 5.94, p &lt; .001). Moreover, SMSE was indirectly associated with QOL through self-care. Self-care was found to mediate the relationship between symptom-management self-efficacy and global QOL (indirect effect = 0.54, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.18). The level of 95% CI was significant. Conclusions The present study supports that self-efficacy beliefs and self-care both significantly and positively influence the quality of life of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3129007501,"Phytoplasmas are cell wall-less bacteria that induce abnormal plant growth and various diseases, causing severe economic loss. Phytoplasmas are highly dependent on nutrients imported from host cells because they have lost many genes involved in essential metabolic pathways during reductive evolution. However, metabolic crosstalk between phytoplasmas and host plants and the mechanisms of phytoplasma nutrient acquisition remain poorly understood. In this study, using metabolomics approach, sweet cherry virescence (SCV) phytoplasma-induced metabolite alterations in sweet cherry trees were investigated. A total of 676 metabolites were identified in SCV phytoplasma-infected and mock inoculated leaves, of which 187 metabolites were differentially expressed, with an overwhelming majority belonging to carbohydrates, fatty acids/lipids, amino acids, and flavonoids. Available omics data of interactions between plant and phytoplasma were also deciphered and integrated into the present study. The results demonstrated that phytoplasma infection promoted glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway activities, which provide energy and nutrients, and facilitate biosynthesis of necessary low-molecular metabolites. Our findings indicated that phytoplasma can induce reprograming of plant metabolism to obtain nutrients for its own replication and infection. The findings from this study provide new insight into interactions of host plants and phytoplasmas from a nutrient acquisition perspective."
https://openalex.org/W3128775928,"Background The community practice towards disposal of expired and unused medications in spite of its adverse impact have been widely neglected in many developing countries. The available guidelines in Tanzania focus on the disposal of expired medications and cosmetics in hospitals and community pharmacies only. Aim The aim of this study was to assess the disposal practice of expired and unused medications at household level in Mwanza city, north-western Tanzania. Methodology The household based cross-sectional study was conducted among 359 randomly selected household members. Semi-structured questionnaires were used for interview during data collection and while STATA ® version 13 was used for analysis. Results Out 359 households visited, 252 (70.19%) had medications kept in their houses at the time of data collection. Among them, 10 (4.0%) households had kept medications at their houses because they were still continuing with treatment while 242 (96.0%) kept unused medications which were supposed to be discarded. The main reason for keeping unused or expired medications at home was uncompleted course of treatment (199 (82.20%) after feeling that they had recovered from illness. The main reason for discarding medications were recovering from illness (141(48.7%) and expiry (136 (46.9%). The major discarding practices for medications were disposing into domestic trashes (219 (75.5%) and pit latrines (45 (15.5%). Majority of respondents (273 (76%) were aware that improper disposal of expired medications are detrimental to human health and environment in general. Conclusion Improper disposal of unused and expired medications at household level was a common practice in the study area. Tailor-made interventions by the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) and other national as well as local stake holders are urgently needed to address the situation."
https://openalex.org/W3127040170,"Canadians face an emerging threat of Lyme disease due to the northward expansion of the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis . We evaluated the degree of I . scapularis population establishment and Borrelia burgdorferi occurrence in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from 2017–2019 using active surveillance at 28 sites. We used a field indicator tool developed by Clow et al. to determine the risk of I . scapularis establishment for each tick cohort at each site using the results of drag sampling. Based on results obtained with the field indicator tool, we assigned each site an ecological classification describing the pattern of tick colonization over two successive cohorts (cohort 1 was comprised of ticks collected in fall 2017 and spring 2018, and cohort 2 was collected in fall 2018 and spring 2019). Total annual site-specific I . scapularis density ranged from 0 to 16.3 ticks per person-hour. Sites with the highest density were located within the Greenbelt zone, in the suburban/rural areas in the western portion of the city of Ottawa, and along the Ottawa River; the lowest densities occurred at sites in the suburban/urban core. B . burgdorferi infection rates exhibited a similar spatial distribution pattern. Of the 23 sites for which data for two tick cohorts were available, 11 sites were classified as “high-stable”, 4 were classified as “emerging”, 2 were classified as “low-stable”, and 6 were classified as “non-zero”. B . burgdorferi -infected ticks were found at all high-stable sites, and at one emerging site. These findings suggest that high-stable sites pose a risk of Lyme disease exposure to the community as they have reproducing tick populations with consistent levels of B . burgdorferi infection. Continued surveillance for I . scapularis , B . burgdorferi , and range expansion of other tick species and emerging tick-borne pathogens is important to identify areas posing a high risk for human exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the face of ongoing climate change and urban expansion."
https://openalex.org/W3127811565,"Homeobox genes encode transcription factors which regulate basic processes in development and cell differentiation and are grouped into classes and subclasses according to sequence similarities. Here, we analyzed the activities of the 20 members strong TALE homeobox gene class in early hematopoiesis and in lymphopoiesis including developing and mature B-cells, T-cells, natural killer (NK)-cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). The resultant expression pattern comprised eleven genes and which we termed TALE-code enables discrimination of normal and aberrant activities of TALE homeobox genes in lymphoid malignancies. Subsequent expression analysis of TALE homeobox genes in public datasets of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients revealed overexpression of IRX3, IRX4, MEIS1, MEIS3, PBX1, PBX4 and TGIF1. As paradigm we focused on PBX1 which was deregulated in about 17% HL patients. Normal PBX1 expression was restricted to hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors of T-cells and ILCs but absent in B-cells, reflecting its roles in stemness and early differentiation. HL cell line SUP-HD1 expressed enhanced PBX1 levels and served as an in vitro model to identify upstream regulators and downstream targets in this malignancy. Genomic studies of this cell line therein showed a gain of the PBX1 locus at 1q23 which may underlie its aberrant expression. Comparative expression profiling analyses of HL patients and cell lines followed by knockdown experiments revealed NFIB and TLX2 as target genes activated by PBX1. HOX proteins operate as cofactors of PBX1. Accordingly, our data showed that HOXB9 overexpressed in HL coactivated TLX2 but not NFIB while activating TNFRSF9 without PBX1. Further downstream analyses showed that TLX2 activated TBX15 which operated anti-apoptotically. Taken together, we discovered a lymphoid TALE-code and identified an aberrant network around deregulated TALE homeobox gene PBX1 which may disturb B-cell differentiation in HL by reactivation of progenitor-specific genes. These findings may provide the framework for future studies to exploit possible vulnerabilities of malignant cells in therapeutic scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3126156055,"Child mortality rates remain unacceptably high in low-resource settings. Cause of death (CoD) is often unknown. Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS)-using biopsy needles to obtain post-mortem samples-for histopathological and microbiologic investigation is increasingly being promoted to improve child and adult CoD attribution. ""MITS in Malawi"" is a sub-study of the Childhood Acute Illness & Nutrition (CHAIN) Network, which aims to identify biological and socioeconomic mortality risk factors among young children hospitalized for acute illness or undernutrition. MITS in Malawi employs standard MITS and a novel post-mortem endoscopic intestinal sampling approach to better understand CoD among children with acute illness and/or malnutrition who die during hospitalization.To understand factors that may impact MITS acceptability and inform introduction of the procedure to ascertain CoD among children with acute illness or malnutrition who die during hospitalization in Malawi.We conducted eight focus group discussions with key hospital staff and community members (religious leaders and parents of children under 5) to explore attitudes towards MITS and inform consent processes prior to commencing the MITS in Malawi study. We used thematic content analysis drawing on a conceptual framework developed from emergent themes and MITS acceptability literature.Feelings of power over decision-making within the hospital and household, trust in health systems, and open and respectful health worker communication with parents were important dimensions of MITS acceptability. Other facilitating factors included the potential for MITS to add CoD information to aid sense-making of death and contribute to medical knowledge and new interventions. Potential barriers to acceptability included fears of organ and blood harvesting, disfigurement to the body, and disruption to transportation and burial plans.Social relationships and power dynamics within healthcare systems and households are a critical component of MITS acceptability, especially given the sensitivity of death and autopsy."
https://openalex.org/W3126466605,"Background Antibiotic resistance is an important Public Health problem and many studies link it to antibiotic misuse. The population plays a key role in such misuse. Objective The aim of this study was thus to explore the factors that might influence antibiotic use and resistance in the general population. Methods Qualitative research using the focus group (FG) method. Groups were formed by reference to the following criteria: age (over and under 65 years); place of origin; and educational/professional qualifications. FG sessions were recorded, transcribed and then separately analysed by two researchers working independently. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Results Eleven FGs were formed with a total of 75 participants. The principal factors identified as possible determinants of antibiotic misuse were: (i) lack of knowledge about antibiotics; (ii) doctor-patient relationship problems; (iii) problems of adherence; and, (iv) use without medical prescription. Antibiotic resistance is a phenomenon unknown to the population and is perceived as an individual problem, with the term “resistance” being confused with “tolerance”. None of the groups reported that information about resistance had been disseminated by the health care sector. Conclusions The public is unaware of the important role it plays in the advance of antimicrobial resistance. There is evidence of diverse factors, many of them modifiable, which might account for antibiotic misuse. Better understanding these factors could be useful in drawing up specific strategies aimed at improving antibiotic use."

The aim of this study was to identify predictors of mortality outcome of pediatric patients with clinical diphtheria. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using patient medical records at five referral hospitals in the Province of Jakarta and one in Tangerang District, Banten Province during January 2017 to 31 August 2018. All children in the age group of 1–18 years old discharged with diagnosis of clinical diphtheria formed the study group. All anonymized patient data were evaluated for demographic issues, clinical features, immunization status, complication, laboratory profiles and outcome. Results A total of 283 patients with clinical diphtheria were included in the study group with case fatality rate of 3.5%. All mortal patients had the complication of myocarditis. Regression analyses revealed factors for predicting mortality. Incomplete primary diphtheria toxoid immunization, stridor, bull neck, leukocytosis ≥15 x10 9 cells/L and thrombocytopenia ≤150 x10 9 cells/L in each combination for 2 predictors modeling were correlated with death. Conclusions We report key predictors of mortality in pediatric patients with clinical diphtheria. The presence of these features when admitted to the hospital must be taken into account, because they can lead to fatal outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3127084636,"Background Analysis of cell-free tumour DNA, a liquid biopsy, is a promising biomarker for cancer. We have performed a proof-of principle study to test the applicability in the clinical setting, analysing copy number alterations (CNAs) in plasma and tumour tissue from 44 patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer. Methods DNA was isolated from blood plasma and a tissue sample from each patient. Array-CGH was applied to the tissue DNA. The cell-free plasma DNA was sequenced by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing using a clinical pipeline for non-invasive prenatal testing. WISECONDOR and ichorCNA, two bioinformatic tools, were used to process the output data and were compared to each other. Results Cancer-associated CNAs could be seen in 59% (26/44) of the tissue biopsies. In the plasma samples, a targeted approach analysing 61 regions of special interest in gastro-oesophageal cancer detected cancer-associated CNAs with a z-score &gt;5 in 11 patients. Broadening the analysis to a whole-genome view, 17/44 patients (39%) had cancer-associated CNAs using WISECONDOR and 13 (30%) using ichorCNA. Of the 26 patients with tissue-verified cancer-associated CNAs, 14 (54%) had corresponding CNAs in plasma. Potentially clinically actionable amplifications overlapping the genes VEGFA , EGFR and FGFR2 were detected in the plasma from three patients. Conclusions We conclude that low-coverage whole-genome sequencing without prior knowledge of the tumour alterations could become a useful tool for cell-free tumour DNA analysis of total CNAs in plasma from patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3126184640,"Dental turbines and scalers, used every day in dental operatories, feature built-in water spray that generates considerable amounts of water aerosol. The problem is that it is not exactly known how much. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, several aerosol safety recommendations have been issued—based on little empirical evidence, as almost no data are available on the exact aerosol concentrations generated during dental treatment. Similarly, little is known about the differences in the efficacy of different commercially available aerosol control systems to reduce in-treatment aerosol load. In this in vitro study, we used spectrometry to explore these questions. The time-dependent effect of conventional airing on aerosol concentrations was also studied. Everyday patient treatment situations were modeled. The test setups were defined by the applied instrument and its spray direction (high-speed turbine with direct/indirect airspray or ultrasonic scaler with indirect airspray) and the applied aerosol control system (the conventional high-volume evacuator or a lately introduced aerosol exhaustor). Two parameters were analyzed: total number concentration in the entire measurement range of the spectrometer and total number concentration within the 60 to 384 nm range. The results suggest that instrument type and spray direction significantly influence the resulting aerosol concentrations. Aerosol generation by the ultrasonic scaler is easily controlled. As for the high-speed turbine, the efficiency of control might depend on how exactly the instrument is used during a treatment. The results suggest that scenarios where the airspray is frequently directed toward the air of the operatory are the most difficult to control. The tested control systems did not differ in their efficiency, but the study could not provide conclusive results in this respect. With conventional airing through windows with a standard fan, a safety airing period of at least 15 minutes between treatments is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3127465953,"Background Seasonal influenza is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease that may cause high morbidity and mortality in susceptible populations. Healthcare workers are a priority group for seasonal influenza vaccination to protect them from contracting influenza and prevent nosocomial transmission to patients. This study aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of seasonal influenza vaccination among healthcare workers in Honduras. Method From August 24 to October 21, 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional KAP survey regarding seasonal influenza vaccination to a random sample of healthcare workers who attended patients in hospitals of the Ministry of Health of Honduras (SESAL) and Honduran Social Security Institute (IHSS). We reported frequency distributions of demographics, vaccination KAP, sources of information, and reasons for non-vaccination. We used principal components factor analysis to create knowledge and attitude scores. We used linear regression to analyze associations between demographics and sources of information about the influenza vaccine, and knowledge and attitude scores. We used logistic regression to analyze associations between demographics, sources of information, knowledge scores, and attitude scores, and influenza vaccination. Result We surveyed 947 healthcare workers who attended patients in 13 SESAL hospitals and two IHSS hospitals. Only 4.6% of participants knew the seasonal influenza vaccine was composed of inactivated viruses, 94.7% believed vaccination causes flu-like symptoms, and 52.0% were vaccinated for influenza in 2018. Knowledge scores were lower for nursing assistants and other healthcare professionals compared to doctors, and higher for healthcare workers who attended a healthcare facility training ( P -values≤0.030). Attitude scores were higher for healthcare workers who attended ≥11 patients per day having ≤10 patients per day as reference, self-reported influenza vaccination in previous year, and cited trainings and informal information at the healthcare facility as sources of information for influenza vaccination ( P -values≤0.030). Factors associated with self-reported vaccination were self-reported influenza vaccination in previous year (aOR: 7.61; 95% CI: 5.24–11.04), attitude score (aOR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.07–1.21), and worked in a SESAL hospital (aOR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.12–2.68) having IHSS as reference. Conclusion Although influenza vaccination is required by law in Honduras and available for free in public health centers, coverage of healthcare workers in 2018 was half that reported in 2017. Lower coverage may be attributed to misconceptions of vaccination side effects."

https://openalex.org/W3126639091,"This study aimed to analyze the proportion, characteristics and prognosis of untreated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in a large representative nationwide study. A cohort study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in Korea. A total of 63,668 newly-diagnosed HCC patients between January 2008 and December 2013 were analyzed. Patients were categorized into treatment group and no treatment group using claim codes after HCC diagnosis. The proportion of untreated HCC patients was 27.6%, decreasing from 33.4% in 2008 to 24.8% in 2013. Compared to treated patients, untreated patients were more likely to be older ( P &lt; 0.001), female ( P &lt; 0.01), to have a distant SEER stage ( P &lt; 0.001), severe liver disease ( P &lt; 0.001), and lower income ( P &lt; 0.001). The fully-adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality comparing untreated to treated patients was 3.11 (95% CI, 3.04–3.18). The risk of mortality was higher for untreated patients in all pre-defined subgroups, including those with distant SEER stage and those with severe liver disease. About one fourth of newly diagnosed HCC patients did not receive any HCC-specific treatment. Untreated patients showed higher risk of mortality compared to treated patients in all subgroups. Further studies are needed to identify obstacles for HCC treatment and to improve treatment rates."
https://openalex.org/W3127458686,"Neuromodulation of the primary visual cortex using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) can alter visual perception and enhance neuroplasticity. However, the mechanisms that underpin these effects are currently unknown. When applied to the motor cortex, a-tDCS reduces the concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an effect that has been linked to increased neuroplasticity. The aim of this study was to assess whether a-tDCS also reduces GABA-mediated inhibition when applied to the human visual cortex. Changes in visual cortex inhibition were measured using the mixed percept duration in binocular rivalry. Binocular rivalry mixed percept duration has recently been advocated as a direct and sensitive measure of visual cortex inhibition whereby GABA agonists decrease mixed percept durations and agonists of the excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACH) increase them. Our hypothesis was that visual cortex a-tDCS would increase mixed percept duration by reducing GABA-mediated inhibition and increasing cortical excitation. In addition, we measured the effect of continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) of the visual cortex on binocular rivalry dynamics. When applied to the motor or visual cortex, cTBS increases GABA concentration and we therefore hypothesized that visual cortex cTBS would decrease the mixed percept duration. Binocular rivalry dynamics were recorded before and after active and sham a-tDCS (N = 15) or cTBS (N = 15). Contrary to our hypotheses, a-tDCS had no effect, whereas cTBS increased mixed percepts during rivalry. These results suggest that the neurochemical mechanisms of a-tDCS may differ between the motor and visual cortices."
https://openalex.org/W3127592971,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the primary yeast species responsible for most fermentations in winemaking. However, other yeasts, including Saccharomyces uvarum , have occasionally been found conducting commercial fermentations around the world. S . uvarum is typically associated with white wine fermentations in cool-climate wine regions, and has been identified as the dominant yeast in fermentations from France, Hungary, northern Italy, and, recently, Canada. However, little is known about how the origin and genetic diversity of the Canadian S . uvarum population relates to strains from other parts of the world. In this study, a highly diverse S . uvarum population was found dominating uninoculated commercial fermentations of Chardonnay grapes sourced from two different vineyards. Most of the strains identified were found to be genetically distinct from S . uvarum strains isolated globally. Of the 106 strains of S . uvarum identified in this study, four played a dominant role in the fermentations, with some strains predominating in the fermentations from one vineyard over the other. Furthermore, two of these dominant strains were previously identified as dominant strains in uninoculated Chardonnay fermentations at the same winery two years earlier, suggesting the presence of a winery-resident population of indigenous S . uvarum . This research provides valuable insight into the diversity and persistence of non-commercial S . uvarum strains in North America, and a stepping stone for future work into the enological potential of an alternative Saccharomyces yeast species."
https://openalex.org/W3128073717,"Background Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is the gold standard index for evaluating portal hypertension; however, measuring HVPG is invasive. Although transient elastography (TE) is the most common procedure for evaluating organ stiffness, accurate measurement of spleen stiffness (SS) is difficult. We developed a device to demonstrate the diagnostic precision of TE and suggest this technique as a valuable new method to measure SS. Methods Of 292 consecutive patients enrolled in this single-centre, translational, cross-sectional study from June through September in 2019, 200 underwent SS measurement (SSM) using an M probe (training set, n = 130; inspection set, n = 70). We performed TE with B-mode imaging using an ultrasound-fusion method, printed new devices with a three-dimensional printer, and attached the magnetic position sensor to the convex and M probes. We evaluated the diagnostic precision of TE to evaluate the risk of esophagogastric varices (EGVs). Results The median spleen volume was 245 mL (range, 64–1,720 mL), and it took 2 minutes to acquire a B-mode image using the ultrasound-fusion method. The median success rates of TE were 83.3% and 57.6% in patients with and without the new device, respectively (p&lt;0.001); it was 76.9% and 35.0% in patients with and without splenomegaly (&lt;100 mL), respectively (p&lt;0.001). In the prediction of EGVs, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.921 and 0.858 in patients with and without the new device, respectively (p = 0.043). When the new device was attached, the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 3.44 and 0.11, respectively. The cut-off value of SSM was 46.0 kPa. Data that were similar between the validation and training sets were obtained. Conclusions The SS can be precisely measured using this new device with TE and ultrasound-fusion method. Similarly, we can estimate the bleeding risk due to EGV using this method."
https://openalex.org/W3126591344,"To enrich carotenoids, especially β-cryptoxanthin, in juice sac tissues of fruits via molecular breeding in citrus, allele mining was utilized to dissect allelic variation of carotenoid metabolic genes and identify an optimum allele on the target loci characterized by expression quantitative trait (eQTL) analysis. SNPs of target carotenoid metabolic genes in 13 founders of the Japanese citrus breeding population were explored using the SureSelect target enrichment method. An independent allele was determined based on the presence or absence of reliable SNPs, using trio analysis to confirm inheritability between parent and offspring. Among the 13 founders, there were 7 PSY alleles, 7 HYb alleles, 11 ZEP alleles, 5 NCED alleles, and 4 alleles for the eQTL that control the transcription levels of PDS and ZDS among the ancestral species, indicating that some founders acquired those alleles from them. The carotenoid composition data of 263 breeding pedigrees in juice sac tissues revealed that the phenotypic variance of carotenoid composition was similar to that in the 13 founders, whereas the mean of total carotenoid content increased. This increase in total carotenoid content correlated with the increase in either or both β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin in juice sac tissues. Bayesian statistical analysis between allelic composition of target genes and carotenoid composition in 263 breeding pedigrees indicated that PSY-a and ZEP-e alleles at PSY and ZEP loci had strong positive effects on increasing the total carotenoid content, including β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin, in juice sac tissues. Moreover, the pyramiding of these alleles also increased the β-cryptoxanthin content. Interestingly, the offset interaction between the alleles with increasing and decreasing effects on carotenoid content and the epistatic interaction among carotenoid metabolic genes were observed and these interactions complexed carotenoid profiles in breeding population. These results revealed that allele composition would highly influence the carotenoid composition in citrus fruits. The allelic genotype information for the examined carotenoid metabolic genes in major citrus varieties and the trio-tagged SNPs to discriminate the optimum alleles ( PSY-a and ZEP-e ) from the rest would promise citrus breeders carotenoid enrichment in fruit via molecular breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3128351237,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly common in hospitalized patients and is associated with increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality. However, data regarding the prevalence of CKD in the African hospitalized patient population are limited. We therefore examined the prevalence and associated factors of impaired renal function and albuminuria among adult patients admitted to the internal medicine wards of a hospital in Northeast Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1 to April 30, 2020 at the inpatient settings of Dessie referral hospital. Data on demographics and medical history were obtained, and serum creatinine and albuminuria were analyzed. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. CKD was defined as impaired eGFR (&lt;60 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) and/or albuminuria. Univariate and multivariable analysis were conducted to determine factors associated with impaired eGFR and albuminuria. Results A total of 369 patients were included in this study. The prevalence of impaired eGFR was 19.0% (95%CI: 15.2%–23.2%) and albuminuria was 30.9% (95%CI: 26.3%–35.7%). Overall, 33.9% (95%CI: 29.2%–38.9%) of the patients had some degree of CKD, but only 21.6% (95%CI: 15.1%–29.4%) were aware of their renal disease. In multivariable analysis, older age, a family history of kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension and HIV were independently associated with both impaired eGFR and albuminuria while male gender was independently associated with only albuminuria. Conclusions CKD is common in adult patients admitted to the internal medicine wards, but only few patients are aware of their condition. These findings highlight the need for feasible approaches to timely identify kidney disease and raise awareness on the importance of detection and early intervention in the inpatient settings."

However, the mechanism for the maintenance of HBV in a latent state within host cells remains unclear. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we identified four genes linked to the maintenance of HBV in a liver cell line expressing HBV RNA at a low frequency. These genes included DOCK11 and DENND2A , which encode small GTPase regulators. In primary human hepatocytes infected with HBV, knockdown of these two genes decreased the amount of both HBV DNA and covalently closed circular DNA to below the limit of detection. Our findings reveal a role for DOCK11 and DENND2A in the maintenance of HBV."
https://openalex.org/W3129088051,"The blue swimming crab (BSC), Portunus pelagicus (Linnaeus 1758), inhabits coastal areas of Southeast and East Asia, and is one of high fisheries commodities with an export value for Indonesia and an increasing global market demand, annually. However, the data of genetic diversity and their spatial connectivity of populations in Indonesia are not yet known, even when it is important to inform stock unit management and sustainable use. This study aimed to determine the genetic diversity and differentiation of blue swimming crabs across Indonesian populations in different Fishery Management Area (FMA), and their spatial genetic connectivity, as well as to deliver implications for sustainable fishery. A total of 297 individuals were collected and amplified using cytochrome oxidase I mitochondrial DNA. This study has showed the highest values for haplotype and nucleotide diversity in the eastern part of Indonesia, where exploitation is relatively low. Significant genetic differentiation between populations ( F ST = 0.954; p &lt; 0.001) and the fisheries management areas ( F ST = 0.964; p &lt; 0.001) were revealed. Low spatial connectivity was observed between populations in a distance of at least more than 60 kilometers. This study suggests that BSC populations in Indonesia, likely have several stock units, and preferably different fisheries management plans and actions across the region thoroughly and simultaneously. This would be effective for management and their sustainable conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3127222029,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a transcription factor, plays a critical role in adaption to hypoxia, which is a major feature of diseases, including cancer. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is up-regulated in numerous cancers and leads to cancer progression. PDI, a member of the TRX superfamily, regulates the transcriptional activities of several transcription factors. To investigate the mechanisms by which PDI affects the function of HIF-1alpha, the overexpression or knockdown of PDI was performed. The overexpression of PDI decreased HIF-1alpha expression in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line, Hep3B, whereas the knockdown of endogenous PDI increased its expression. NH 4 Cl inhibited the decrease in HIF-1alpha expression by PDI overexpression, suggesting that HIF-1alpha was degraded by the lysosomal pathway. HIF-1alpha is transferred to lysosomal membranes by heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein (HSC70). The knockdown of HSC70 abolished the decrease, and PDI facilitated the interaction between HIF-1alpha and HSC70. HIF-1alpha directly interacted with PDI. PDI exists not only in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but also in the cytosol. Hypoxia increased cytosolic PDI. We also investigated changes in the redox state of HIF-1alpha using PEG-maleimide, which binds to thiols synthesized from disulfide bonds by reduction. An up-shift in the HIF-1alpha band by the overexpression of PDI was detected, suggesting that PDI formed disulfide bond in HIF-1alpha. HIF-1alpha oxidized by PDI was not degraded in HSC70-knockdown cells, indicating that the formation of disulfide bond in HIF-1alpha was important for decreases in HIF-1alpha expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show the regulation of the expression and redox state of HIF-1alpha by PDI. We also demonstrated that PDI formed disulfide bonds in HIF-1alpha 1–245 aa and decreased its expression. In conclusion, the present results showed that PDI is a novel factor regulating HIF-1alpha through lysosome-dependent degradation by changes in its redox state."
https://openalex.org/W3128017914,"Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae infects both sheep and goats causing pneumonia resulting in considerable economic losses worldwide. Current diagnosis methods such as bacteriological culture, serology, and PCR are time consuming and require sophisticated laboratory setups. Here we report the development of two rapid, specific and sensitive assays; an isothermal DNA amplification using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and a real-time PCR for the detection of M . ovipneumoniae . The target for both assays is a specific region of gene WP_069098309.1, which encodes a hypothetical protein and is conserved in the genome sequences of ten publicly available M . ovipneumoniae strains. The RPA assay performed well at 39°C for 20 min and was combined with a lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) for easy visualization of the amplicons. The detection limit of the RPA-LFD assay was nine genome copies of M . ovipneumoniae per reaction and was comparable to sensitivity of the real-time PCR assay. Both assays showed no cross-reaction with 38 other ovine and caprine pathogenic microorganisms and two parasites of ruminants, demonstrating a high degree of specificity. The assays were validated using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and nasal swab samples collected from sheep. The positive rate of RPA-LFD (97.4%) was higher than the real-time PCR (95.8%) with DNA as a template purified from the clinical samples. The RPA assay was significantly better at detecting M . ovipneumoniae in clinical samples compared to the real-time PCR when DNA extraction was omitted (50% and 34.4% positive rate for RPA-LFD and real-time PCR respectively). The RPA-LFD developed here allows easy and rapid detection of M . ovipneumoniae infection without DNA extraction, suggesting its potential as a point-of-care test for field settings."
https://openalex.org/W3128052476,"Stairs are among the most hazardous locations, and stair descending contributes to a high risk of falls among the elderly under dual-task (DT) conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the practitioners of Tai Chi (TC), one type of mind-body exercise, have lower fall risks under DT conditions during stair descending, compared with their no-exercise (NE) counterparts. Fifteen TC practitioners with at least 10 years of experience in TC and fifteen NE participants were recruited in this study. They were asked to descend a six-step staircase under single-task (ST) and DT conditions. An eight-camera motion analysis system and two force plates were used for data collection. Results showed group by DT interactions in walking velocity (p = 0.016) and center of mass–center of pressure inclination angle (COM–COP IA) in the anteroposterior directions (p = 0.026). Group effects observed with foot clearance (p = 0.031), trunk (p = 0.041) and head (p = 0.002) tilt angles, and COM–COP IA in the mediolateral (p = 0.006) directions. Significant DT effects only detected in foot clearance (p = 0.004). Although both groups of participants adopted a more cautious gait strategy under the dual-task condition, the TC practitioners were less influenced by the DT paradigm than their NE counterparts. Our observations indicated that TC practitioners have lower fall risks under DT conditions during stair descending."
https://openalex.org/W3126463867,"Background The polygenic risk score (PRS) developed for coronary artery disease (CAD) is known to be effective for classifying patients with CAD and predicting subsequent events. However, the PRS was developed mainly based on the analysis of Caucasian genomes and has not been validated for East Asians. We aimed to evaluate the PRS in the genomes of Korean early-onset AMI patients (n = 265, age ≤50 years) following PCI and controls (n = 636) to examine whether the PRS improves risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors. Results The odds ratio of the PRS was 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.69–1.99) for early-onset AMI patients compared with the controls. For the classification of patients, the area under the curve (AUC) for the combined model with the six conventional risk factors (diabetes mellitus, family history of CAD, hypertension, body mass index, hypercholesterolemia, and current smoking) and PRS was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90–0.94) while that for the six conventional risk factors was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85–0.93). Although the AUC for PRS alone was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.61–0.69), adding the PRS to the six conventional risk factors significantly improved the accuracy of the prediction model ( P = 0.015). Patients with the upper 50% of PRS showed a higher frequency of repeat revascularization (hazard ratio = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.47–3.26) than the others. Conclusions The PRS using 265 early-onset AMI genomes showed improvement in the identification of patients in the Korean population and showed potential for genomic screening in early life to complement conventional risk prediction."
https://openalex.org/W3127348187,"The conventional approach to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) involving breath holds, electrocardiography-gating, and acquisition of a short-axis (SAX) image stack, introduces technical and logistical challenges for assessing exercise left ventricular (LV) function. Real-time, free-breathing CMR acquisition of long-axis (LAX) images overcomes these issues and also enables assessment of global longitudinal strain (GLS). We evaluated the reliability of a free-breathing LAX approach compared to the standard SAX approach and the reproducibility of free-breathing LAX. LV SAX (contiguous stack) and LAX (two-chamber and four-chamber) 3T CMR cine images were acquired four times within one scan in 32 women with cardiovascular risk factors (56±10 years, 28±4 kg/m 2 ) as follows: 1) resting, gated-segmented, end-expiration breath-hold; 2) resting, real-time, free-breathing; 3) test-retest set of resting, real-time, free-breathing; 4) peak exercise (incremental-to-maximum, in-magnet, stepper test), real-time, free-breathing. A second scan was performed within one week in a subset (n = 5) to determine reproducibility of peak exercise measures. Reliability and agreement of the free-breathing LAX approach with the conventional SAX approach were assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots, respectively. Normal control GLS reserve was also acquired in a separate set of 12 young, healthy control women (25±4 years, 22±2 kg/m 2 ) for comparison. Comparisons of LV volumes and function among all techniques at rest had good-to-excellent reliability (ICC = 0.80–0.96), and excellent reliability between peak exercise free-breathing LAX and SAX evaluations (ICC = 0.92–0.96). Higher resting heart rates with free-breathing acquisitions compared to breath-hold (mean difference, limits of agreement: 5, 1–12 beats per minute) reduced reliability for cardiac output (ICC = 0.67–0.79). Reproducibility of the free-breathing LAX approach was good-to-excellent at rest and peak exercise (ICC = 0.74–0.99). GLS exercise reserve was impaired in older women at cardiovascular risk compared to young healthy women (-4.7±2.3% vs -7.4±2.1%, p = 0.001). Real-time, free-breathing CMR with LAX evaluation provides a reliable and reproducible method to assess rest and peak exercise cardiac function, including GLS."
https://openalex.org/W3128157436,"Sense of agency (SoA), the feeling of control over one’s own actions and their effects, is fundamental to goal-directed actions at the individual level and may constitute a cornerstone of everyday life, including cooperative behavior (i.e., goal sharing). Previous studies have demonstrated that goal sharing can activate the motor prediction of both agent’s action and partner’s action in joint-action tasks. Moreover, given that from an SoA perspective, predictive processes are an essential basis, there is a possibility that goal sharing may modulate SoA. However, the possibility for goal sharing to modulate SoA remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether goal sharing modulates the intentional binding (IB) effect (a method that can quantitatively measure SoA) of self-generated and observed partner’s actions and improves motor accuracy. Participants were required to stop a circular horizontal moving object by pressing a key when the object reaches the center of a target in a social situation. This task measured IB by having participants estimate the time interval between action and effect in several 100 milliseconds, with shorter time interval estimations indicating enhancement of SoA. Participants were randomly divided into 13 Cooperative groups (goal sharing) and 13 Independent groups (non-goal sharing). Cooperative groups were instructed to perform the task together, while Independent groups did so individually. Participants estimated the time interval between them by pressing the key and hearing the corresponding sound (Self-generated action) and the other person pressing the key and hearing the sound (Observed action). Our results indicated that goal sharing improved motor accuracy and enhanced both the IB of Self-generated and Observed actions compared to non-goal sharing. We suggest that SoA can be modulated by goal sharing in specific social contexts."

Its etiology and pathogenesis are not well defined in part due to the lack of reliable modeling. Here, we present the development of an in vitro three-dimensional lung-on-chip biochip designed to mimic granuloma formation. A lung on chip fluidic macrodevice was developed and added to our previously developed a lung-on-membrane model (LOMM). Granulomas were cultured from blood samples of patients with sarcoidosis and then inserted in the air-lung-interface of the microchip to create a three-dimensional biochip pulmonary sarcoidosis model (3D BSGM). Cytokines were measured after 48 hours. ELISA testing was performed to measure cytokine response difference between LOMM with 3D BSGM. There were statistically significant differences in IL-1ß (P = 0.001953), IL-6 (P = 0.001953), GM-CSF (P = 0.001953), and INF-γ expressions (P = 0.09375) between two groups.

https://openalex.org/W3128177601,"Objective Anal cancer is an uncommon malignancy with the primary treatment for localized disease being concurrent radiation and chemotherapy. Pre-treatment PET/CT is useful for target delineation, with minimal exploration of its use in prognostication. In the post-treatment setting there is growing evidence for advanced PET metrics in assessment of treatment response, and early identification of recurrence essential for successful salvage, however this data is limited to small series. Methods Patient with non-metastatic anal cancer from a single institution were retrospectively reviewed for receipt of pre- and post-treatment PET/CTs. PET data was co-registered with radiation therapy planning CT scans for precise longitudinal assessment of advanced PET metrics including SUV max , metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), for assessment with treatment outcomes. Treatment outcomes included local recurrence (LR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), as defined from the completed radiation therapy to the time of the event. Cox proportional hazard modeling with inverse probability weighting (IPW) using the propensity score based on age, BMI, T-stage, and radiation therapy dose were utilized for assessment of these metrics. Results From 2008 to 2017 there were 72 patients who had pre-treatment PET/CT, 61 (85%) had a single follow up PET/CT, and 35 (49%) had two follow up PET/CTs. The median clinical follow-up time was 25 months (IQR: 13–52) with a median imaging follow up time of 16 months (IQR: 7–29). On pre-treatment PET/CT higher MTV 2.5 and TLG were significantly associated with higher risk of local recurrence (HR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06–1.16, p&lt;0.001; and HR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05–1.19, p&lt;0.001), and worse PFS (HR 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04–1.13, p&lt;0.001; and HR 1.09, 95% CI: 1.03–1.12, p = 0.003) and OS (HR 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04–1.16, p = 0.001; and HR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04–1.20, p = 0.004). IPW-adjusted pre-treatment PET/CT showed higher MTV 2.5 (HR 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02–1.17, p = 0.012) and TLG (HR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00–1.20, p = 0.048) were significantly associated with worse PFS, and post-treatment MTV 2.5 was borderline significant (HR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.00–1.35, p = 0.052). Conclusion Advanced PET metrics, including higher MTV 2.5 and TLG, in the pre-treatment and post-treatment setting are significantly associated with elevated rates of local recurrence, and worse PFS and OS. This adds to the growing body of literature that PET/CT for patient with ASCC should be considered for prognostication, and additionally is a useful tool for consideration of early salvage or clinical trial of adjuvant therapies."

The ocular surface mycobiota of horses has not yet been described using NGS techniques. This study aimed to characterize the ocular surface fungal microbiota (mycobiota) in healthy horses in 2 environmental conditions (stalled versus pasture). Conjunctival swabs of both eyes were obtained from 7 adult stallions stabled in an open-air pavilion and 5 adult mares living on pasture. Genomic DNA was extracted from ocular surface swabs and sequenced using primers that target the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) region of the fungal genome on an Illumina platform. Sequences were processed using Quantitative Insights Into Molecular Ecology (QIIME 2.0) and taxonomy assigned with the Findley et al. 2013 ITS1 database. The most abundant genera identified were Leptosphaerulina (22.7%), unclassified Pleosporaceae (17.3%), Cladosporium (16.2%), Alternaria (9.8%), unclassified Pleosporales (4.4%), unclassified Montagnulaceae (2.9%), Fusarium (2.5%), and Pestalotiopsis (1.4%). Fungal community composition (Jaccard, R = 0.460, p = 0.001) and structure (Bray-Curtis, R = 0.811, p = 0.001) were significantly different between pastured mares and stabled stallions. The ocular surface of pastured mares had significantly increased fungal species richness and diversity compared to stabled stallions (Shannon p = 0.0224, Chao1 p = 0.0118, Observed OTUs p = 0.0241). Relative abundances of Aspergillus (p = 0.005) and Alternaria spp. (p = 0.002) were significantly increased in the mycobiota of pastured mares. This is the first report to describe the mycobiota of the equine ocular surface.

It is highly frequent in sickle cell disease (SCD) associated with hemolytic episodes. Our aim was to investigate molecules that may participate in the regulation of vascular tone. Eighty eight individuals with SCD were included, of whom thirty-seven reported a history of priapism. Priapism was found to be associated with alterations in laboratory biomarkers, as well as lower levels of HbF. Patients with sickle cell anemia using hydroxyurea and those who received blood products seemed to be less affected by priapism. Multivariate analysis suggested that low HbF and NOm were independently associated with priapism. The frequency of polymorphisms in genes NOS3 and EDN1 was not statistically significant between the studied groups, and the presence of the variant allele was not associated with alterations in NOm and ET-1 levels in patients with SCD. The presence of the variant allele in the polymorphisms investigated did not reveal any influence on the occurrence priapism. Future studies involving larger samples, as well as investigations including patients in priapism crisis, could contribute to an enhanced understanding of the development of priapism in SCD."
https://openalex.org/W3127858485,"Objectives This study considers whether orphans’ experiences with physically and psychologically violent discipline differ from non-orphans in sub-Saharan Africa, and to what extent national, community, household, caretaker, and child characteristics explain those differences. Methods We use cross-sectional Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) administered between 2010–2017 in 14 sub-Saharan African countries. The sample included 125,197 children, of which 2,937 were maternal orphans, 9,113 were paternal orphans, and 1,858 were double orphans. We estimate the difference between orphans and non-orphans experience of harsh discipline using multivariable logistic regressions with country fixed effects and clustered standard errors. Results Findings show that orphaned children experience less harsh discipline in the home. With the exception of double orphans’ experience with physically violent discipline, these differences persisted even after controlling for a rich set of child, household, and caretaker characteristics. Conclusions We propose two alternative explanations for our surprising findings and provide a supplementary analysis to help arbitrate between them. The evidence suggests that orphaned children (especially those with a deceased mother) are less likely to experience harsh discipline because of lower caretaker investment in their upbringing. We encourage future research to draw on in-depth interviews or household surveys with discipline data from multiple children in a home to further unpack why orphans tend to experience less harsh punishment than other children."
https://openalex.org/W3127912677,"Background In Zambia, before rotavirus vaccine introduction, the virus accounted for about 10 million episodes of diarrhoea, 63 000 hospitalisations and 15 000 deaths in 2015, making diarrhoea the third leading cause of death after pneumonia and malaria. In Zambia, despite the introduction of the vaccine acute diarrhoea due to rotaviruses has continued to affect children aged five years and below. This study aimed to characterise the rotavirus genotypes which were responsible for diarrhoeal infections in vaccinated infants aged 2 to 12 months and to determine the relationship between rotavirus strains and the severity of diarrhoea in 2016. Methods Stool samples from infants aged 2 to 12 months who presented to the hospital with acute diarrhoea of three or more episodes in 24 hours were tested for group A rotavirus. All positive specimens that had enough sample were genotyped using reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). A 20-point Vesikari clinical score between 1–5 was considered as mild, 6–10 as moderate and greater or equal to 11 as severe. Results A total of 424 stool specimens were tested of which 153 (36%, 95% CI 31.5% to 40.9%) were positive for VP6 rotavirus antigen. The age-specific rotavirus infections decreased significantly (p = 0.041) from 2–4 months, 32.0% (49/118) followed by a 38.8% (70/181) infection rate in the 5–8 months’ category and subsequently dropped in the infants aged 9–12 months with a positivity rate of 27.2%. 38.5% of infants who received a single dose, 34.5% of those who received a complete dose and 45.2% (19/42) of the unvaccinated tested positive for rotavirus. The predominant rotavirus genotypes included G2P[6] 36%, G1P[8] 32%, mixed infections 19%, G2P[4] 6%, G1P[6] 4% and G9P[6] 3%. Discussion and conclusion Results suggest breakthrough infection of heterotypic strains (G2P[6] (36%), homotypic, G1P[8] (32%) and mixed infections (19%) raises concerns about the effects of the vaccination on the rotavirus diversity, considering the selective pressure that rotavirus vaccines could exert on viral populations. This data indicates that the rotavirus vaccine has generally reduced the severity of diarrhoea despite the detection of the virus strains."
https://openalex.org/W3128318104,"Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) has shown efficacy in bone repair and yet the optimum characteristics of this modality and its molecular mechanism remain unclear. To determine the effects of timing of PEMF treatment, we present a novel three-dimensional culture model of osteogenesis that demonstrates strong de novo generation of collagen and mineral matrix and exhibits stimulation by PEMF in multiple stages over 62 days of culture. Mouse postnatal day 2 calvarial pre-osteoblasts were cast within and around Teflon rings by polymerization of fibrinogen and cultured suspended without contact with tissue culture plastic. Ring constructs were exposed to PEMF for 4h/day for the entire culture (Daily), or just during Day1-Day10, Day11-Day 27, or Day28-Day63 and cultured without PEMF for the preceding or remaining days, and compared to no-PEMF controls. PEMF was conducted as HF Physio, 40.85 kHz frequency with a 67 ms burst period and an amplitude of 1.19 mT. Osteogenesis was kinetically monitored by repeated fluorescence measurements of continuously present Alizarin Red S (ARS) and periodically confirmed by micro-CT. PEMF treatment induced early-onset and statistically significant transient stimulation (~4-fold) of the mineralization rate when PEMF was applied Daily, or during D1-D10 and D11-D27. Stimulation was apparent but not significant between D28-D63 by ARS but was significant at D63 by micro-CT. PEMF also shifted the micro-CT density profiles to higher densities in each PEMF treatment group. Ring culture generated tissue with a mineral:matrix ratio of 2.0 by thermogravimetric analysis (80% of the calvaria control), and the deposited crystal structure was 50% hydroxyapatite by X-ray diffraction (63% of the calvaria and femur controls), independent of PEMF. These results were consistent with backscatter, secondary electron, and elemental analysis by scanning electron microscopy. Thus, in a defined, strong osteogenic environment, PEMF applied at different times was capable of further stimulation of osteogenesis with the potential to enhance bone repair."
https://openalex.org/W3129122245,"Measurement of heart rate variability can reveal autonomic nervous system function. Changes in heart rate variability can be associated with disease severity, risk of complications, and prognosis. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of heart rate variability measurements in patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury after decompression surgery. We conducted a prospective study of 80 patients with traumatic brain injury after decompression surgery using a noninvasive electrocardiography device for data collection. Assessment of heart rate variability parameters included the time and frequency domains. The correlations between heart rate variability parameters and one-year mortality and functional outcomes were analyzed. Time domain measures of heart rate variability, using the standard deviation of the RR intervals and the square root of the mean squared differences of successive RR intervals, were statistically significantly lower in the group of patients with unfavorable outcomes and those that died. In frequency domain analysis, very low-frequency and total power were significantly higher in patients with favorable functional outcomes. High-frequency, low-frequency, and total power were statistically significantly higher in patients who survived for more than one year. Multivariate analysis using a model combining age and the Glasgow Coma Scale score with variables derived from heart rate variability substantially improved the prognostic value for predicting long-term outcome. These findings reinforced the concept that traumatic brain injury impacts the brain-heart axis and cardiac autonomic modulation even after decompression surgery, and variables derived from heart rate variability may be useful predictors of outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3126309228,"In order to improve the performance of differential evolution (DE), this paper proposes a ranking-based hierarchical random mutation in differential evolution (abbreviated as RHRMDE), in which two improvements are presented. First, RHRMDE introduces a hierarchical random mutation mechanism to apply the classic “DE/rand/1” and its variant on the non-inferior and inferior group determined by the fitness value. The non-inferior group employs the traditional mutation operator “DE/rand/1” with global and random characteristics, which increases the global exploration ability and population diversity. The inferior group uses the improved mutation operator “DE/rand/1” with elite and random characteristics, which enhances the local exploitation ability and convergence speed. Second, the control parameter adaptation of RHRMDE not only considers the complexity differences of various problems but also takes individual differences into account. The proposed RHRMDE is compared with five DE variants and five non-DE algorithms on 32 universal benchmark functions, and the results show that the RHRMDE is superior over the compared algorithms."

Our aim was to explore the experiences, distress and burden among Norwegian neurologists during the first weeks of the pandemic. Methods Hospital-based neurologists in Norway (n = 400) were invited to a web-based survey in April 2020. The study focused on patient management, organizational changes and personal stress during the first weeks of the pandemic lockdown. Work-home interface stress was assessed by the Cooper Job Stress Questionnaire. Results In total, 135 neurologists participated. Seventy-three% experienced a change in their personal work situation, and 67% examined patients with suspected COVID-19 infection and neurological disease. Changed access to resources, and the perception that medical follow-up was unsatisfactory, were associated with a high degree of burden and stress. Neurologists were also worried about the potential lack of PPE and the fear of spreading SARS CoV-2 to close family members. The mean score of work-home interface stress was 2.8 with no significant differences between gender or specialist status. Reduced standard of care was reported for all neurological conditions, and in particular for non-emergency treatments. Conclusion The vast majority of neurologists in Norway experienced a change in their personal work situation during the first phase of the pandemic. The fear of becoming infected and ill was not a major contributor to burden and stress."

Pneumococcal carriage rates estimated in this cohort study among children in a rural community of northern India. Between August 2012 and August 2014, trained nurses made weekly home visits to screen enrolled children aged &lt;10 years for acute upper or lower respiratory infections (AURI/ALRI) in Ballabgarh, Haryana. Nasal swab from infants aged &lt;1year and throat swab from children aged ≥1 year were collected. All specimens were cultured for pneumococci; isolates were serotyped and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. During the study period, 4348 nasal/throat swabs collected from children with clinical features of ARI (836 ALRI, 2492 AURI) and from 1020 asymptomatic children. Overall pneumococcal carriage was 5.1%, the highest carriage rate among children &lt;1 year of age (22.6%). The detection rates were higher among children with ARI (5.6%; 95% CI: 4.8–6.4) than asymptomatic children (3.3%; 95% CI: 2.3–4.6). Among 220 pneumococcal isolates, 42 diverse serotypes were identified, with 6B/C (8.6%), 19A (7.2%), 19F (6.8%), 23F (6.4%), 35A/B/C (6.4%), 15B (5%), 14 (4.5%) and 11A/C/D (3.2%) accounting for 50%. Forty-five percent of the serotypes identified are included in the current formulation of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Ninety-six percent of isolates were resistant to co-trimoxazole, 9% were resistant to erythromycin, and 10% had intermediate resistance to penicillin with minimum inhibitory concentration ranges (0.125 to 1.5 μg/ml). Pneumococcal detection was relatively low among children in our study community but demonstrated a diverse range of serotypes and half of these serotypes would be covered by the current formulation of 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W3128047096,"Objective Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a fatal respiratory infection, mostly associated with immunocompromised conditions. Several reports have described PCP development in patients who were not immunocompromised, but the clinical course and prognosis of PCP are not well understood. We compared the clinical characteristics and prognoses between patients with and without immunocompromised conditions who developed PCP. Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients who had been treated for PCP from three hospitals. We defined immunocompromised (IC) status as following: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; hematological malignancy; solid organ tumor under chemotherapy; rheumatic disease; medication with immunosuppressive agents. Patients without immunocompromised status were defined as being non-immunocompromised (non-IC). Results The IC and non-IC groups comprised 173 and 14 patients. The median ages were 62.0 and 74.0 years in the IC and the non-IC group, respectively. The median interval between admission and anti-PCP treatment was significantly longer for patients in the non-IC group than that for patients in the IC group (7 vs. 2 days). The in-hospital mortality rates were significantly higher for patients in the non-IC group than that for patients in the IC group (71.4% vs. 43.9%; P = 0.047). A longer interval between admission and anti-PCP therapy was associated with increased 90-day mortality rate in patients with PCP (hazard ratio, 1.082; 95% confidence interval, 1.015–1.153; P = 0.016). Conclusions Patients with PCP with no predisposing illnesses were older and had higher mortality rates than IC patients with PCP. Delayed anti-PCP treatment was associated with increased 90-day mortality."

The global water crisis could be mitigated by applying innovative technologies, sound water management decisions, and successful business models, and it is essential to better understand the status and future trends of emerging water markets. This study aims to discover shifts in the entrepreneurial landscape and evaluate water startups' development performance for the sustainable development of emerging water markets. We collected and analyzed data including the founding date, service area, service provided, details of funding raised, revenues, and consumer responses on 132 water startups founded between 2008 and 2018 in California, USA. Our results indicated that municipal area dominated the emerging water startup market compared to agricultural and industrial areas, and that many of the services provided shifted from conventional technologies to digital technologies. Though digital water startups' current revenues were relatively low, digital techniques applied in the water industry exhibited the good potential to promote public health and water saving. The development trends and performance of water startups enlighten the technological and commercial revolutions in the emerging water market, and provide guidelines for the decision-making in relevant stakeholders in the scientific, governmental, and industrial communities."
https://openalex.org/W3128936112,"Objective Several epidemiological and clinical reports associate fibromyalgia (FM) with seizure disorders, and clinical studies associate FM diagnosis with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. However, these associations rely on self-reports of being diagnosed with FM or unstandardized clinical diagnosis in combination with small samples. We investigated the association of FM and self-reported seizures using a large rheumatic disease databank and the current established self-reported, symptom-based FM diagnostic criteria. Methods We selected a random observation from 11,378 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 2,390 (21.0%) of whom satisfied 2016 revised criteria for FM. Patients were inquired about the presence of any kind of seizures in the previous 6 months, anti-epileptic medications, and patient-reported symptoms and outcomes. Results Seizures were reported by 89 RA patients who met FM criteria (FM+) and by 97 patients who did not (FM-), resulting in an age- and sex-adjusted seizure prevalence of 3.74 (95% CI 2.95 to 4.53) per 100 FM+ subjects and 1.08 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.30) in FM- subjects. The seizure odds ratio of FM+ to FM- cases was 3.54 (95% CI 2.65 to 4.74). Seizures were associated to a very similar degree with symptom reporting (somatic symptom count and comorbidity index) as to FM diagnosis variables. RA patients reporting seizures also reported worse pain, quality of life, and functional status. Seizure patients treated with anti-seizure medication had worse outcomes and more comorbidities than seizure patients with no seizure drugs. Conclusions We found a significant and similar association of both FM diagnostic variables and FM-related symptom variables, including the number of symptoms and comorbidities, with self-reported seizures in people with RA. The observed association was similar to those found in previous studies of symptoms variables and seizures and does not suggest a unique role for fibromyalgia diagnosis. Rather, it suggests that multi-symptom comorbidity is linked to seizures in a complex and not yet clearly understood way. As the current study relied on self-reported seizures and was not able to distinguish between epileptic and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, future studies are needed to replicate the findings using both validated FM criteria assessments and clinically verified diagnoses of epileptic and psychogenic seizures."

We examined the impact of various popular color schemes on experts’ and lay peoples’ map-based decisions in two, geography and neuroscience, scenarios, in an online visualization experiment. We found that changes in color mappings influence domain experts, especially neuroimaging experts, more in their decision-making than novices. Geographic visualization experts exhibited more trust in the unfavorable rainbow color scale than would have been predicted by their suitability ratings and their training, which renders them sensitive to scale appropriateness. Our empirical results make a strong call for increasing scientists’ awareness for and training in perceptually salient and cognitively informed design principles in data visualization."
https://openalex.org/W3128439011,"Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) is a serum protease inhibitor that regulates increased lung protease production induced by cigarette smoking. Mutations in the Serpina1 gene cause AAT to form hepatoxic polymers, which can lead to reduced availability for the protein’s primary function and severe liver disease. An AAT antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) was previously identified to be beneficial for the AATD liver disease by blocking the mutated AAT transcripts. Here we hypothesized that knockdown of AAT aggravates murine lung injury during smoke exposure and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 4 groups each for the smoking and smoke-flu injury models. The ASO and control (No-ASO) were injected subcutaneously starting with smoking or four days prior to influenza infection and then injected weekly at 50 mg/kg body weight. ASO treatment during a 3-month smoke exposure significantly decreased the serum and lung AAT expression, resulting in increased Cela1 expression and elastase activity. However, despite the decrease in AAT, neither the inflammatory cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) nor the lung structural changes were significantly worsened by ASO treatment. We observed significant differences in inflammation and emphysema due to smoke exposure, but did not observe an ASO treatment effect. Similarly, with the smoke-flu model, differences were only observed between smoke-flu and room air controls, but not as a result of ASO treatment. Off-target effects or compensatory mechanisms may account for this finding. Alternatively, the reduction of AAT with ASO treatment, while sufficient to protect from liver injury, may not be robust enough to lead to lung injury. The results also suggest that previously described AAT ASO treatment for AAT mutation related liver disease may attenuate hepatic injury without being detrimental to the lungs. These potential mechanisms need to be further investigated in order to fully understand the impact of AAT inhibition on protease-antiprotease imbalance in the murine smoke exposure model."
https://openalex.org/W3128960812,"At least 2.1 billion people around the world use contaminated drinking water, causing 485,000 diarrheal deaths each year, mostly among children under 5 years old. A study conducted 10 years ago in Bafoussam (West Cameroon) recorded concentrations of bacteria among surface and groundwater. High levels of bicarbonates, phosphates, chlorides and suspended matters were also found. The aim of this study was to assess the microbiological and chemical qualities of domestic water sources in 5 localities of the West region of Cameroon. Water samples from 22 water sources (wells, springs, water drilling and river) were aseptically collected in plastic bottles and transferred in 50 ml sterile tubes. For chlorinated water sources, 1 ml of Thiosulfate was added to the water sample; immediately placed in an ice box and transported to the laboratory for analysis. Water temperature and pH were measured on site. The microbiological quality of water was determined by testing Total Coliforms (TC) using the Micro Biological Survey method. 1 ml of each water sample was inoculated in the MBS vial initially rehydrated with 10 ml of sterile distilled water. The initial color of the vials is red. Color changes were monitored at three different time intervals (12h, 19h and 24h), corresponding to three levels of contamination. The chemical quality of water was assessed using micronucleus (MN) test in selected Vicia faba seeds secondary root tips permanently mounted in Dibutylphthalate Polystyrene Xylene mountant for histology after 72 hours of direct exposition in water samples and in dark. The mitotic indices and MN frequencies were evaluated in 10 root tips per site analysing 5000 cells per tip. Statistical analyses were done using Stata IC/15.0 software. The Student t -test was used for mean comparison and the significance level was set at 1%. The majority of samples were collected from wells (63.6%). The mean water pH ranged from 5.5 to 8.3 and the temperature varied from 23 to 26°C. A very high concentration of TC [&gt;10 3 CFU/ml] was found in 8 (36.4%) samples. 10 (45.5%) and 2 (9.1%) samples turned yellow at 19 and 24 hours respectively after incubation corresponding to TC concentration of [10&lt;x&lt;10 3 CFU/ml] and [1&lt;x&lt; 10 CFU/ml]. The MN frequency was higher (P ≤ 0.01) compared to the negative control in 9 (40.9%) water samples indicating significant genotoxic effects of these water sources. This study highlighted the poor quality of domestic water sources in West region of Cameroon and the need to conduct regular monitoring of drinking water sources. Community capacity building on water treatment methods, including good wastes management should be implemented to help improve water quality."
https://openalex.org/W3126923740,"Objectives This study aims to propose a cytological classification, to evaluate predictive factors of the final malignancy, and to suggest a proper management strategy for neck lymph nodes (LNs) with indeterminate cytology. Methods Patients who had neck lymphadenopathy with indeterminate cytology between 2007 and 2017 were analyzed retrospectively in a tertiary medical center. Cytological classification was conducted according to the cytological descriptions. We examined the clinical characteristics according to the final diagnosis of the neck lymphadenopathy. Results According to the final diagnoses, there were 142 malignant and 95 benign neck LNs among 237 patients. Multivariate analyses using a stepwise logistic regression model showed that cytological classification [p &lt; 0.001, OR = 5.67 (3.48–9.23)], prior history of malignancy [p = 0.01, OR = 2.97 (1.26–6.99)], long axis [p = 0.01, OR = 3.06 (1.33–7.06)], short-to-long axis (S/L) ratio [p = 0.047, OR = 2.15 (1.01–4.57)] and internal echogenicity [p = 0.01, OR = 2.72 (1.26–5.86)] were independent predictors of malignancy. Conclusions In patients who have neck LNs with indeterminate cytology, a cytological classification and four other predictors (prior history of malignancy, long axis ≥ 1.93 cm, S/L ratio ≥ 0.64 and heterogeneity of internal echogenicity) are statistically associated with the risk of malignancy and helpful in guiding further management."
https://openalex.org/W3127201686,"Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a very active research question within the area of text mining, generally applied to news feeds and Twitter datasets, where topics and events are detected. The notion of ""event"" is broad, but typically it applies to occurrences that can be detected from a single post or a message. Little attention has been drawn to what we call ""micro-events"", which, due to their nature, cannot be detected from a single piece of textual information. The study investigates the feasibility of micro-event detection on textual data using a sample of messages from the Stack Overflow Q&A platform and Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) version releases from Libraries.io dataset. We build pipelines for detection of micro-events using three different estimators whose parameters are optimized using a grid search approach. We consider two feature spaces: LDA topic modeling with sentiment analysis, and hSBM topics with sentiment analysis. The feature spaces are optimized using the recursive feature elimination with cross validation (RFECV) strategy. In our experiments we investigate whether there is a characteristic change in the topics distribution or sentiment features before or after micro-events take place and we thoroughly evaluate the capacity of each variant of our analysis pipeline to detect micro-events. Additionally, we perform a detailed statistical analysis of the models, including influential cases, variance inflation factors, validation of the linearity assumption, pseudo R squared measures and no-information rate. Finally, in order to study limits of micro-event detection, we design a method for generating micro-event synthetic datasets with similar properties to the real-world data, and use them to identify the micro-event detectability threshold for each of the evaluated classifiers."
https://openalex.org/W3128031160,"Surgical site infections (SSIs) are significant and frequent perioperative complications, occurring due to the contamination of the surgical site. The late detection of SSIs, especially organ/space SSIs which are the more difficult to treat, often leads to severe complications. An effective method that can identify bacteria with a high accuracy, leading to the early detection of organ/space SSIs, is needed. Ninety-eight drainage fluid samples obtained from 22 patients with hepatobiliary pancreatic disease were analyzed to identify microorganisms using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) with a new membrane filtration protocol and rapid BACpro ® pretreatment compared to sole rapid BACpro ® pretreatment. The levels of detail of rapid BACpro ® pretreatment with or without filtration were also evaluated for the accuracy of bacterial identification. We found that reliable scores for E . coli and E . faecalis were obtained by inoculation with 1.0 × 10 4 CFU/m l after preparation of the membrane filter with rapid BACpro ® , indicating approximately 10-folds more sensitive compared to sole rapid BACpro ® pretreatment in drainage fluid specimens. Among 60 bacterial positive colonies in drainage fluid specimens, the MALDI-TOF MS and the membrane filtration with rapid BACpro ® identified 53 isolates (88.3%) with a significantly higher accuracy, compared to 25 isolates in the rapid BACpro ® pretreatment group (41.7%) (p &lt; 0.001). Among the 78 strains, 14 enteric Gram-negative bacteria (93.0%) and 55 Gram-positive cocci (87.3%) were correctly identified by the membrane filtration with rapid BACpro ® with a high reliability. This novel protocol could identify bacterial species within 30 min, at $2-$3 per sample, thus leading to cost and time savings. MALDI-TOF MS with membrane filter and rapid BACpro ® is a quick and reliable method for bacterial identification in drainage fluids. The shortened analysis time will enable earlier selection of suitable antibiotics for treatment of organ/space SSIs to improve patients’ outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3128811151,"Introduction A review of Uganda’s HIV Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) program in 2010 revealed poor retention outcomes for HIV-exposed infants (HEI) after testing. The review informed development of the ‘EID Systems Strengthening’ model: a set of integrated initiatives at health facilities to improve testing, retention, and clinical care of HIV-exposed and infected infants. The program model was piloted at several facilities and later scaled countrywide. This mixed-methods study evaluates the program’s impact and assesses its implementation. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study at 12 health facilities in Uganda, comprising all HEI tested by DNA PCR from June 2011 to May 2014 (n = 707). Cohort data were collected manually at the health facilities and analyzed. To assess impact, retention outcomes were statistically compared to the baseline study’s cohort outcomes. We conducted a cross-sectional qualitative assessment of program implementation through 1) structured clinic observation and 2) key informant interviews with health workers, district officials, NGO technical managers, and EID trainers (n = 51). Results The evaluation cohort comprised 707 HEI (67 HIV+). The baseline study cohort contained 1268 HEI (244 HIV+). Among infants testing HIV+, retention in care at an ART clinic increased from 23% (57/244) to 66% (44/67) (p &lt; .0001). Initiation of HIV+ infants on ART increased from 36% (27/75) to 92% (46/50) (p &lt; .0001). HEI receiving 1st PCR results increased from 57% (718/1268) to 73% (518/707) (p &lt; .0001). Among breastfeeding HEI with negative 1st PCR, 55% (192/352) received a confirmatory PCR test, a substantial increase from baseline period. Testing coverage improved significantly: HIV+ pregnant women who brought their infants for testing after birth increased from 18% (67/367) to 52% (175/334) (p &lt; .0001). HEI were tested younger: mean age at DBS test decreased from 6.96 to 4.21 months (p &lt; .0001). Clinical care for HEI was provided more consistently. Implementation fidelity was strong for most program components. The strongest contributory interventions were establishment of ‘EID Care Points’, integration of clinical care, longitudinal patient tracking, and regular health worker mentorship. Gaps included limited follow up of lost infants, inconsistent buy-in/ownership of health facility management, and challenges sustaining health worker motivation. Discussion Uganda’s ‘EID Systems Strengthening’ model has produced significant gains in testing and retention of HEI and HIV+ infants, yet the country still faces major challenges. The 3 core concepts of Uganda’s model are applicable to any country: establish a central service point for HEI, equip it to provide high-quality care and tracking, and develop systems to link HEI to the service point. Uganda’s experience has shown the importance of intensively targeting systemic bottlenecks to HEI retention at facility level, a necessary complement to deploying rapidly scalable technologies and other higher-level initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W3129137480,"Purpose This study aimed to examine the association between confidence in accessing HIV services, primary sources of HIV information, and primary care provider status for African American and Latinx individuals in Indiana. Methods An online survey was disseminated to African American and Latinx individuals using snowball and social media recruitment methods, resulting in a final sample size of n = 308. A multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to examine the relationships between confidence accessing HIV services, primary care provider status, sexual identification, and sources of HIV information. Results Of the total respondents, 62.5% (n = 193) identified as male and 36.9% (n = 114) identified as female. Most identified as African American (72.5%, n = 224), followed by 27.2% (n = 84) who identified as Latinx. Participants who used their primary care providers as a primary source of obtaining HIV information had a significantly higher level of comfort with accessing HIV services. Those who identified family members as a primary source of HIV information and those who identified as bisexual demonstrated a lower level of confidence in accessing HIV services. Discussion This study's results enhance our understanding of marginalization within minority groups regarding sexual identification and accessing HIV services. These results also offer insight into the importance of healthcare access because having a primary care provider was a strong predictor of increased confidence in accessing HIV services."
