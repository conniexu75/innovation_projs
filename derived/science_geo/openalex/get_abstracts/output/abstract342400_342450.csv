https://openalex.org/W2010614057,"Recent extinction rates are 100 to 1000 times their pre-human levels in well-known, but taxonomically diverse groups from widely different environments. If all species currently deemed ""threatened"" become extinct in the next century, then future extinction rates will be 10 times recent rates. Some threatened species will survive the century, but many species not now threatened will succumb. Regions rich in species found only within them (endemics) dominate the global patterns of extinction. Although new technology provides details of habitat losses, estimates of future extinctions are hampered by our limited knowledge of which areas are rich in endemics."
https://openalex.org/W2167314788,"Many ecological phenomena are sensitive to spatial heterogeneity and fluxes within spatial mosaics. Landscape ecology, which concerns spatial dynamics (including fluxes of organisms, materials, and energy) and the ways in which fluxes are controlled within heterogeneous matrices, has provided new ways to explore aspects of spatial heterogeneity and to discover how spatial pattern controls ecological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2096504411,"A 30,000-year paleotemperature record derived from noble gases dissolved in carbon-14-dated ground water indicates that the climate in lowland Brazil (Piaui Province, 7°S, 41.5°W; altitude, 400 meters) was 5.4° ± 0.6°C cooler during the last glacial maximum than today. This result suggests a rather uniform cooling of the Americas between 40°S and 40°N. A 5.4°C cooling of tropical South America is consistent with pollen records, snow line reconstructions, and strontium/calcium ratios and δ18O coral records but is inconsistent with the sea-surface temperature reconstruction of CLIMAP (Climate: Long-Range Investigation, Mapping and Prediction). On the basis of these results, it appears that the tropical Americas are characterized by a temperature sensitivity comparable to that found in higher latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W1999472310,"A method is described for increasing luminescence in poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) light-emitting diodes. Cis linkages were engineered into the PPV chain. These linkages interrupt conjugation and interfere with the packing of the polymer chains, which results in the formation of amorphous PPV. Large-area electroluminescent devices were prepared from this polymer. Devices made of an aluminum electrode, PPV as the luminescent layer, and an electron-transporting layer have internal quantum efficiencies of 2 percent, a turn-on voltage of 20 volts, and can carry current densities of 2000 milliamperes per square centimeter. The current density is at least an order of magnitude higher than previously obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2071887281,"Late Miocene tidal sediments of Acre, Brazilian Amazonia, were deposited in an embayment or interior seaway located in the sub-Andean zone. This late Tertiary embayment system may once have connected the Caribbean with the South Atlantic. The tidal coasts of the embayment-seaway have provided an avenue for the earliest waif (over water) dispersal phases of the great American biotic interchange in the late Miocene. The subsequent change from semimarine to terrestrial environments is of value in assessing the importance of earlier hypotheses on the evolution of the westem Amazonian landscape and gives insight into the formation of several observed biogeographic patterns, especially of aquatic biota."
https://openalex.org/W4253193482,"Experimental manipulations of entire ecosystems have been conducted in lakes, catchments, streams, and open terrestrial and marine environments. Experiments have addressed applied problems of ecosystem management and complex responses of communities and ecosystems to perturbations. In the course of some experiments, environmental indicators and models have been developed and tested. Surprising results with implications for ecological understanding and management are common."
https://openalex.org/W2078536912,"Roughly 43 percent of Earth's terrestrial vegetated surface has diminished capacity to supply benefits to humanity because of recent, direct impacts of land use. This represents an approximately 10 percent reduction in potential direct instrumental value (PDIV), defined as the potential to yield direct benefits such as agricultural, forestry, industrial, and medicinal products. If present trends continue, the global loss of PDIV could reach approximately 20 percent by 2020. From a biophysical perspective, recovery of approximately 5 percent of PDIV is feasible over the next 25 years. Capitalizing on natural recovery mechanisms is urgently needed to prevent further irreversible degradation and to retain the multiple values of productive land."
https://openalex.org/W1999031666,"Natural and anthropogenic global changes are associated with substantial ecological disturbances. Multiscale interconnections among disciplines studying the biotic and abiotic effects of such disturbances are needed. Three research paradigms traditionally have been used and are reviewed here: scale-up, scale-down, and scale-up with embedded scale-down components. None of these approaches by themselves can provide the most reliable ecological assessments. A fourth research paradigm, called strategic cyclical scaling (SCS), is relatively more effective. SCS involves continuous cycling between large- and small-scale studies, thereby offering improved understanding of the behavior of complex environmental systems and allowing more reliable forecast capabilities for analyzing the ecological consequences of global changes."
https://openalex.org/W2013403933,"Some of the classic experiments in ecology have involved real organisms interacting in the laboratory, that is, model systems. Ecologists are increasingly using model systems to investigate problems of global environmental change and questions about the assembly, persistence, and stability of complex communities. Model laboratory systems are a halfway house between mathematical models and the full complexity of the field, and they yield powerful insights into the dynamics of populations and ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2037973134,"Phylogenetic techniques were used to estimate and reconstruct advertisement calls at ancestral nodes. These calls were used to investigate the degree of preference of female túngara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus) for both extant and ancestral calls. Females did not discriminate between calls of males of their own species and calls at their most recent ancestral node. They also recognized calls of three extant species and at four ancestral nodes as the signals of appropriate mates. Both shared ancestral history, and call convergence might differentially influence call preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2048345963,"Boron isotope ratios are homogeneous in volcanic glasses of oceanic island basalts [-9.9 +/- 1.3 per mil, relative to standard NBS 951 (defined by the National Bureau of Standards)], whereas mid-oceanic ridge basalts (MORBs) and back-arc basin basalts (BABBs) show generally higher and more variable ratios. Melts that have assimilated even small amounts of altered basaltic crust show significant variations in the boron isotope ratios. Assimilation may thus account for the higher boron ratios of MORBs and BABBs. A budget of boron between mantle and crust implies that the primitive mantle had a boron isotope ratio of -10 +/- 2 per mil and that this ratio was not fractionated significantly during the differentiation of the mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2052074879,Switching behavior between electron tunneling and ballistic transport states was induced by repeatedly bringing a sharpened nickel wire into contact with a gold surface. The high-conductivity ballistic state had a quantized conductance of 0.977 +/- 0.015 (2e(2)/h). Switching was accomplished by moving the electrodes with a piezoelectric actuator over a distance of 2 angstroms. The two electrodes and the actuator form a three-terminal device that is demonstrated to be a reliable digital and analog switch; it shows good discrimination between high and low states and possesses the important property of power gain. The conductance channel is most likely only one atom wide and possibly consists of a single atom.
https://openalex.org/W1978064971,"A ferroelectric field effect in epitaxial thin film SrCuO2/Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 heterostructures was observed. A 3.5 percent change in the resistance of a 40 angstrom SrCuO2 layer (a parent high-temperature superconducting compound) was measured when the polarization field of the Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 layer was reversed by the application of a pulse of small voltage (<5 volts). This effect, both reversible and nonvolatile, is attributed to the electric field-induced charge at the interface of SrCuO2 and Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3. This completely epitaxial thin film approach shows the possibility of making nonvolatile, low-voltage ferroelectric field effect devices for both applications and fundamental studies of field-induced doping in novel compounds like SrCuO2."
https://openalex.org/W4251166147,"Among the environmental problems ahead, the most important ones could be those that are still unknown to us. This conceptual article explores this prospect on the grounds that it is important not only to supply answers to recognized questions but to raise appropriate new questions."
https://openalex.org/W2087926809,"This article analyzes public opinion data on environmental issues collected in two major surveys. The data reveal substantial concern about the environment in both developing and industrial countries along with perceptions that the quality of the environment has declined and will continue to decline. Developing country respondents rate their local and national environmental quality lower than do industrial country respondents, whereas both groups rate global environmental quality about the same. The data also reveal considerable willingness among the developing and industrial countries to accept responsibility for the world's environmental problems and recognition of the importance of governments in addressing local and national environmental issues and of strong international agencies in addressing transnational issues."
https://openalex.org/W1998204686,"In 1960 I attended a European conference on isotope separation, after which I visited the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. A staff member there ventured the opinion that the separation of isotopes will be first on the list of important contributions to the peaceful uses of the atom when the Atomic Energy Commission's memoirs are written in the year 2000."
https://openalex.org/W2006489550,"The key parameters to technological growth have been identified as societal resources and societal expectations. Both of these are evident functions of technology, and their combined effects can be expected to continue technology's historical exponential growth. This growth pattern would be substantially altered only if we assume that knowledge is bounded or if society makes a conscious decision to stop the flow of resources into the production of new technological options. Although such conscious selection among individual technical fields is to be expected, it is very unlikely to apply to the totality of technology since, as society grows more complex it continuously creates new needs (priority factor), which in turn provide new opportunities for the application of technological options (payoff factor). The analysis also clearly emphasizes the important role which awareness of new technologies plays in forming societal expectations."
