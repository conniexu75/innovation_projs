https://openalex.org/W2087610941,"Hornblende deformation twins with twin planes parallel to ( 101) are produced experimentally in single crystals by compression parallel to the c axis. Twinning occurs at confining pressures from 5 to 15 kilobars and temperatures from 400 degrees to 600 degrees C (strain rate, 10(-5) per second)."
https://openalex.org/W1976497037,"Two of the seven Palliaike points show better quality workmanship than the other five. The better workmanship seems to result from use of a material superior to basalt rather than from greater skill. All seven examples show surface smoothing to a varying degree. The bifacial smoothing could be either intentional abrading by the worker or unintentional smoothing by function. Without the aid of considerable magnification and further experiment, it is difficult to pass final judgment. If these points were hafted, it would seem that the bifacial basal smoothing could not be the result of function. Hafting could be accomplished by using resins and adhesives to affix the base of the point to a wooden shaft, as was done by the Kimberley aborigines. Many Clovis points from western North America are smoothed to an even greater degree-for example, those found at the Simon Site in Idaho. Some points show the detachment of short flakes terminating in step fractures. But this may be a result of the Palliaike points being made of basalt, a very difficult material to work, of the worker being less skilled, or of the wooden flaker being inadequate to overcome the coarse-grained material. All the Palliaike points are thick in relation to their width, which makes them resistant to breakage. However, since only one point in the collection (Fig. 1a) shows an attempt at basal thinning, the worker may have been unable to control the coarse-grained basalt, which is difficult to thin with a wooden flaker, or he may simply have wanted the point thick for a particular function."

https://openalex.org/W2023779521,"An apparent correlation between nuclear explosions and earthquakes has been reported for the events between September 1961 and September 1966. When data from the events between September 1966 and December 1968 are examined, this correlation disappears. No relationship between the size of the nuclear explosions and the number of distant earthquakes is apparent in the data."

https://openalex.org/W2051516855,"Three types of polyacrylonitrile yarn were converted to graphite fibers. There was a linear relation between density and Young's modulus of the graphite fibers, the ranges observed being 1.58 to 2.18 grams per cubic centimeter and 25 to 112 Ã— 106 pounds per square inch."
https://openalex.org/W2080112139,"The high density, 1.4 grams per cubic centimeter, reported for anomalous water suggests that high pressures should be conducive to the formation of anomalous water. Six attempts at 60 kilobars in which water was cooled from about 600 degrees C in nickel or platinum tubes, with or without the presence of silica, did not produce any detectable amounts of anomalous water."
https://openalex.org/W1972601184,"Hydrogen atoms have been generated in solution by photolysis of thiols in solutions of organic compounds, and the relative rate constants, k(H), have been measured for the reaction H* + QH --> H(2) + Q*, where QH is any organic compound which contains hydrogen. This represents the first kinetic study of the hydrogen atom in which it is generated in solution by a technique not involving ionizing radiation. The relative values of k(H) are in agreement with the values from radiolysis for most of the substances studied; however, for some compounds significantly different results have been obtained."
