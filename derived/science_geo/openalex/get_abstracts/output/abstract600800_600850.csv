DNA self-assembly is widely used to produce nanoscale structures of ever increasing complexity. The largest structures that can be assembled reliably contain hundreds of individual DNA strands. Peng Yin and colleagues now show that a new generation of DNA bricks—short DNA strands that fold into brick-like shapes and self-assemble according to specific inter-brick interactions—makes it possible to assemble large DNA nanostructures containing a few tens of thousands of individual bricks. One structure, consisting of 10,000 bricks and having 20,000 uniquely addressable 'nano-voxels'—the three-dimensional equivalents of pixels—is used as a molecular analogue of clay to sculpt three-dimensional objects such as letters, a complex helicoid (a shape similar to a spiral staircase) and a teddy bear. With further optimization, the method might produce even larger assemblies that could find use as scaffolds or for positioning functional components. Three related papers is this issue report further advances in DNA origami, and all four are summarized in a News & Views. Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are widely used to construct nanometre-scale structures with ever increasing complexity1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, with possible application in fields such as structural biology, biophysics, synthetic biology and photonics. The nanostructures are formed through one-pot self-assembly, with early kilodalton-scale examples containing typically tens of unique DNA strands. The introduction of DNA origami4, which uses many staple strands to fold one long scaffold strand into a desired structure, has provided access to megadalton-scale nanostructures that contain hundreds of unique DNA strands6,7,10,11,12,13,14. Even larger DNA origami structures are possible15,16, but manufacturing and manipulating an increasingly long scaffold strand remains a challenge. An alternative and more readily scalable approach involves the assembly of DNA bricks, which each consist of four short binding domains arranged so that the bricks can interlock8,9. This approach does not require a scaffold; instead, the short DNA brick strands self-assemble according to specific inter-brick interactions. First-generation bricks used to create three-dimensional structures are 32 nucleotides long, consisting of four eight-nucleotide binding domains. Protocols have been designed to direct the assembly of hundreds of distinct bricks into well formed structures, but attempts to create larger structures have encountered practical challenges and had limited success9. Here we show that DNA bricks with longer, 13-nucleotide binding domains make it possible to self-assemble 0.1–1-gigadalton, three-dimensional nanostructures from tens of thousands of unique components, including a 0.5-gigadalton cuboid containing about 30,000 unique bricks and a 1-gigadalton rotationally symmetric tetramer. We also assembled a cuboid that contains around 10,000 bricks and about 20,000 uniquely addressable, 13-base-pair ‘voxels’ that serves as a molecular canvas for three-dimensional sculpting. Complex, user-prescribed, three-dimensional cavities can be produced within this molecular canvas, enabling the creation of shapes such as letters, a helicoid and a teddy bear. We anticipate that with further optimization of structure design, strand synthesis and assembly procedure even larger structures could be accessible, which could be useful for applications such as positioning functional components."

https://openalex.org/W2774261058,"Rodent studies demonstrate that supplementing the maternal diet with choline during pregnancy produces life-long cognitive benefits for the offspring. In contrast, the two experimental studies examining cognitive effects of maternal choline supplementation in humans produced inconsistent results, perhaps because of poor participant adherence and/or uncontrolled variation in intake of choline or other nutrients. We examined the effects of maternal choline supplementation during pregnancy on infant cognition, with intake of choline and other nutrients tightly controlled. Women entering their third trimester were randomized to consume, until delivery, either 480 mg choline/d (n = 13) or 930 mg choline/d (n = 13). Infant information processing speed and visuospatial memory were tested at 4, 7, 10, and 13 mo of age (n = 24). Mean reaction time averaged across the four ages was significantly faster for infants born to mothers in the 930 (vs. 480) mg choline/d group. This result indicates that maternal consumption of approximately twice the recommended amount of choline during the last trimester improves infant information processing speed. Furthermore, for the 480-mg choline/d group, there was a significant linear effect of exposure duration (infants exposed longer showed faster reaction times), suggesting that even modest increases in maternal choline intake during pregnancy may produce cognitive benefits for offspring.— Caudill, M.

Conventional approaches to drug development have produced potent and specific PTP1B inhibitors, but these inhibitors lack oral bioavailability, which limits their potential for drug development. Here, we report that DPM-1001, an analog of the specific PTP1B inhibitor trodusquemine (MSI-1436), is a potent, specific, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of PTP1B. DPM-1001 also chelates copper, which enhanced its potency as a PTP1B inhibitor. DPM-1001 displayed anti-diabetic properties that were associated with enhanced signaling through insulin and leptin receptors in animal models of diet-induced obesity. Therefore, DPM-1001 represents a proof of concept for a new approach to therapeutic intervention in diabetes and obesity. Although the PTPs have been considered undruggable, the findings of this study suggest that allosteric PTP inhibitors may help reinvigorate drug development efforts that focus on this important family of signal-transducing enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2771974203,"It has been long assumed that post-mitotic neurons only utilize the error-prone non-homologous end-joining pathway to repair double-strand breaks (DSBs) associated with oxidative damage to DNA, given the inability of non-replicating neuronal DNA to utilize a sister chromatid template in the less error-prone homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway. However, we and others have found recently that active transcription triggers a replication-independent recombinational repair mechanism in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Here we observed that the HR repair protein RAD52 is recruited to sites of DNA DSBs in terminally differentiated, post-mitotic neurons. This recruitment is dependent on the presence of a nascent mRNA generated during active transcription, providing evidence that an RNA-templated HR repair mechanism exists in non-dividing, terminally differentiated neurons. This recruitment of RAD52 in neurons is decreased by transcription inhibition. Importantly, we found that high concentrations of amyloid β, a toxic protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, inhibits the expression and DNA damage response of RAD52, potentially leading to a defect in the error-free, RNA-templated HR repair mechanism. This study shows a novel RNA-dependent repair mechanism of DSBs in post-mitotic neurons and demonstrates that defects in this pathway may contribute to neuronal genomic instability and consequent neurodegenerative phenotypes such as those seen in Alzheimer's disease."

An early consequence of immune activation is transcriptional reprogramming, and some NLRs have been shown to act in the nucleus and interact with transcription factors. The Rx1 NLR protein of potato is further able to bind and distort double-stranded DNA. However, Rx1 host targets that support a role for Rx1 in transcriptional reprogramming at DNA are unknown. Here, we report a functional interaction between Rx1 and NbGlk1, a Golden2-like transcription factor. Rx1 binds to NbGlk1 in vitro and in planta. NbGlk1 binds to known Golden2-like consensus DNA sequences. Rx1 reduces the binding affinity of NbGlk1 for DNA in vitro. NbGlk1 activates cellular responses to potato virus X, whereas Rx1 associates with NbGlk1 and prevents its assembly on DNA in planta unless activated by PVX.

https://openalex.org/W2773124547,"When two tasks are performed simultaneously, performance often declines in one or both tasks. These so-called dual-task costs are more pronounced in old than in young adults. One proposed neurological mechanism of the dual-task costs is that old compared with young adults tend to execute single-tasks with higher brain activation. In the brain regions that are needed for both tasks, the reduced residual capacity may interfere with performance of the dual-task. This competition for shared brain regions has been called structural interference. The purpose of the study was to determine whether structural interference indeed plays a role in the age-related decrease in dual-task performance. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate 23 young adults (20–29 years) and 32 old adults (66–89 years) performing a calculation (serial subtraction by seven) and balance-simulation (plantar flexion force control) task separately or simultaneously. Behavioral performance decreased during the dual-task compared with the single-tasks in both age groups, with greater dual-task costs in old compared with young adults. Brain activation was significantly higher in old than young adults during all conditions. Region of interest analyses were performed on brain regions that were active in both tasks. Structural interference was apparent in the right insula, as quantified by an age-related reduction in upregulation of brain activity from single- to dual-task. However, the magnitude of upregulation did not correlate with dual-task costs. Therefore, we conclude that the greater dual-task costs in old adults were probably not due to increased structural interference."

However, the functional role of PROCR and the signaling mechanisms downstream of PROCR remain poorly understood. Here, we dissected the PROCR signaling pathways in breast cancer cells. Combining protein array, knockdown, and overexpression methods, we found that PROCR concomitantly activates multiple pathways. We also noted that PROCR-dependent ERK and PI3k–Akt–mTOR signaling pathways proceed through Src kinase and transactivation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). These pathway activities led to the accumulation of c-Myc and cyclin D1. On the other hand, PROCR-dependent RhoA–ROCK–p38 signaling relied on coagulation factor II thrombin receptor (F2R). We confirmed these findings in primary cells isolated from triple-negative breast cancer–derived xenografts (PDX) that have high expression of PROCR. To the best our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of PROCR signaling in breast cancer cells, and its findings also shed light on the molecular mechanisms of PROCR in stem cells in normal tissue.

In particular, KANK1 recruits the cortical microtubule stabilization complex to FAs via a direct interaction between the ANKRD of KANK1 and kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) (21van der Vaart B. van Riel W.E.

Despite the growing number of known KANK1-binding proteins, the molecular basis governing the target recognition of KANK1 is poorly understood due to a lack of structural information. Here, we report the crystal structures of the ANKRD of KANK1 both in complex with a 28-residue KIF21A fragment at 1.55-Å resolution and in the apo form at 1.9-Å resolution. The complex structure shows a unique binding mode, mediated by a negatively charged surface patch and a hydrophobic interface of the ANKRD. Mutations disrupting the KANK1-KIF21A interaction lead to the abolished recruitment of KIF21A to FAs. Structural comparison implicates a potential conformational change of the ANKRD upon KIF21A binding. Taken together, our structural, biochemical, and cellular studies of the KANK1-KIF21A interaction provide mechanistic insights into the assembly of the KANK1-mediated complex in connecting microtubules and FAs as well as the effects caused by disease-related mutations in KANKs. To obtain insights into the KANK1-mediated target recognition mechanism, we first characterized the binding of KIF21A to KANK1. As the main interacting regions of KANK1 and KIF21A were reported to be the C-terminal ANKRD (KANK1_ANKRD) and a short helical region (KIF21A_H), respectively (Fig. 1A) (21van der Vaart B. van Riel W.E. Doodhi H. Kevenaar J.T. Katrukha E.A. Gumy L. Bouchet B.P. Grigoriev I. Spangler S.A. Yu K.L. Wulf P.S. Wu J. Lansbergen G. van Battum E.Y.

Consistent with the previous report, KANK1_ANKRD strongly interacts with KIF21A_H with sub-μm binding affinity (Fig. 1, B and C). As indicated by the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)–based assay, the binding stoichiometry is close to 1:1. Formation of the KANK1_ANKRD-KIF21A_H heterodimer was confirmed by analytical gel filtration (Fig. 1D). To identify the minimal binding region of KIF21A, we truncated either N-terminal or C-terminal flanking sequences to KIF21A_H. Based on ITC analysis (Figs. 1C and S1), we determined that the 28-residue region (residues 1142–1169) contains the necessary and sufficient elements for the binding of KIF21A_H to KANK1_ANKRD. To understand how this short sequence in KIF21A can be specifically recognized by KANK1, we sought to solve the KANK1_ANKRD-KIF21A_H complex using crystallography. As extensive trials failed to yield any crystals of the complex, we removed flexible regions on both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of KANK1_ANKRD without affecting its binding to KIF21A_H (Fig. 1C). By using this KANK1_ANKRD construct (residues 1088–1338), we successfully obtained high-quality crystals for structural study. The crystal structure of the KANK1_ANKRD-KIF21A_H complex was determined at 1.55-Å resolution using a molecular replacement method (Table 1). Consistent with our biochemical characterization, the complex structure contains one KANK1_ANKRD molecule and one KIF21A_H molecule in each asymmetric unit. As shown in Fig. 3A, the ANKRD contains five ANK repeats (R1–5), capped by an N-terminal helix bundle (α1–α5; named R0 hereafter) to form an α-solenoid fold (Figure 2, Figure 3A). The ANK repeats are similar to each other except for R2, which has a longer sequence and a different conformation at its C-terminal half (Fig. 3B). Thus, the C-terminal helix (α9) of R2 protrudes from the solenoid fold (Fig. 3A).Table 1Statistics of data collection and model refinementData setComplexApoData collection Space groupP212121P21 Unit cell parameters (Å)a = 38.0, b = 52.1, c = 136.1a = 29.1, b = 70.2, c = 60.7, β = 96.9 Resolution range (Å)50–1.55 (1.58–1.55)50–1.9 (1.93–1.9) No. of unique reflections39,577 (2,005)19,134 (949) Redundancy5.4 (5.5)3.7 (3.5) I/σ39.6 (2.7)23.8 (1.2) Completeness (%)98.2 (100)99.8 (99.9) Rmerge (%)aRmerge = Σ|Ii − Im|/ΣIi where Ii is the intensity of the measured reflection and Im is the mean intensity of all symmetry-related reflections.5.7 (83.5)7.7 (119.9) CC½bCC½ is the correlation of one half of randomly chosen observations to the other half.0.99 (0.69)0.99 (0.55)Structure refinement Resolution (Å)50–1.55 (1.59–1.55)50–1.9 (2.0–1.9) Rcryst/Rfree (%)cRcryst = Σ‖Fobs| − |Fcalc‖/Σ|Fobs| where Fobs and Fcalc are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.

Open table in a new tab In the complex structure, the KIF21A_H peptide folds as an extended loop in the N terminus and a short α-helix in the C terminus to interact tightly with the concave side of the ANKRD (Fig. 3A). The five ANK repeats are all involved in forming a highly conserved binding groove using their N-terminal helices and hairpin-like connecting loops (Fig. 3, A and C). Only 15 residues (1154–1168) in KIF21A_H could be successfully traced in the final structural model (Fig. S2). Nevertheless, the binding of KIF21A_H buries a large surface area of ∼900 Å2 on the binding groove of KANK1_ANKRD. This structural finding explains the strong interaction between KIF21A_H and KANK1_ANKRD. Based on the surface properties, the binding groove on the ANKRD can be divided into two parts, site-I and site-II, formed by the repeats R4–5 and R1–3, respectively (Fig. 3, D and E). Site-I contains multiple negatively charged residues, including Glu-1274KANK1, Glu-1284KANK1, Asp-1306KANK1, and Asp-1308KANK1, resulting in a highly negatively charged surface (Fig. 3F). Complementarily, the N-terminal half of KIF21A_H mainly comprises positively charged residues (Fig. 3G). Among these residues, Lys-1154KIF21A, Arg-1156KIF21A, and Arg-1157KIF21A directly form salt bridges with the negatively charged residues on site-I. Although not clearly assigned in the structural model, Lys-1150KIF21A and Lys-1152KIF21A may also contribute to the charge-charge interaction as an N-terminally truncated peptide of KIF21A_H lacking these two residues shows diminished binding affinity (Fig. 1C). Additionally, Arg-1156KIF21A form a hydrogen bond with Ser-1276KANK1 to further strengthen the site-I interaction (Fig. 3D). Unlike site-I, site-II is relatively neutral in its surface charge (Fig. 3F). The site-II interaction is mainly mediated by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3E). In detail, the backbone of the KIF21A_H peptide forms hydrogen bonds with the polar residues, Asn-1171KANK1, Asn-1201KANK1, and His-1252KANK1, in site-II, which places the side chains of Leu-1165KIF21A and Leu-1166KIF21A to interact with a hydrophobic surface patch formed by Tyr-1176KANK1, Tyr-1205KANK1, Leu-1210KANK1, Leu-1213KANK1, and Leu-1248KANK1. To verify the above structural findings, we generated a series of mutations in either KANK1_ANKRD or KIF21A_H designed to disrupt their interaction. As charge complementarity and hydrophobicity are critical for the interactions in site-I and site-II, respectively, we reasoned that a KIF21A_H peptide carrying charge-reversed mutations (e.g. R1156E) or hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic mutations (e.g. L1165Q) would impair its binding to KANK1_ANKRD. Indeed, an ITC-based assay demonstrated that the R1156E variant almost abolishes the binding of KIF21A_H to KANK1_ANKRD, and the L1165Q variant decreases the binding affinity by ∼20-fold (Fig. 4, A and B). Correspondingly, the mutations in site-I and site-II of KANK1_ANKRD (D1306K and L1248Q, respectively) show similar disruptions of binding (Figs. 4C and S1). To further validate this binding mode using the full-length proteins, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments by cotransfection of FLAG-tagged KANK1 and GFP-tagged KIF21A in HEK293T cells. Consistent with our findings with the fragments, the binding of KANK1 to KIF21A is disrupted by the R1156E and L1165Q mutations (Fig. 4D). Taken together, our structural and biochemical data demonstrate that KANK1 specifically recognizes KIF21A via a combination of the charge-charge interaction at site-I and the hydrophobic interaction at site-II. Given the high sequence similarity of the interface residues in KIF21A (Fig. 3G), the binding mode found in our complex structure is very likely to be shared by all vertebrate KIF21A homologues. Previously, KANK1 was reported to target KIF21A to the cell cortex as well as FAs (5Bouchet B.P. Gough R.E. Ammon Y.-C. van de Willige D. Post H. Jacquemet G. Altelaar A.M. Heck A.J. Goult B.T.

We therefore used a cellular colocalization assay to confirm the binding mode between KANK1 and KIF21A in cells. As a control, cellular localizations of individual full-length proteins were checked when overexpressed in COS7 cells. KIF21A shows diffuse cellular distribution with modest enrichment at the cell edge (Fig. 5A). In contrast, KANK1 is mainly found in FA as indicated by colocalization with vinculin, although some diffuse localization at the cell edge is also seen (Fig. 5B). Line profile analysis further demonstrated that KANK1 concentrated at the lateral border of FA (Fig. 5C), fully consistent with previous findings (4Sun Z. Tseng H.-Y. Tan S. Senger F. Kurzawa L. Dedden D. Mizuno N. Wasik A.A. Thery M. Dunn A.R. Fässler R. Kank2 activates talin, reduces force transduction across integrins and induces central adhesion formation.Nat.

We next overexpressed GFP-tagged KIF21A together with Ruby-tagged KANK1 in COS7 cells. As expected, KIF21A colocalized with KANK1 at the FA border (Fig. 5, D and E), indicating that KIF21A was recruited to the FA border by KANK1. Next, we asked whether recruitment of KIF21A to FA by KANK1 is mediated by site-I and site-II. To address this question, we prepared two mutants (R1156E and L1165Q) of KIF21A, disrupting site-I and site-II binding, respectively (Figs. 3G and 4). By overexpressing the two GFP-KIF21A mutants with Ruby-KANK1 in COS7 cells, we found that neither mutant shows significant enrichment at the FA border as indicated by KANK1 (Fig. 5, D and E). These data indicate that FA localization of KIF21A requires the functional binding interface of the ANKRD; disrupting either the site-I or site-II interaction diminishes the FA targeting of KIF21A. To determine whether the ANKRD undergoes a conformational change upon binding of KIF21A, we determined the structure of KANK1_ANKRD alone (Table 1). Structural comparison indicates that the apo form and the KIF21A-bound ANKRD of KANK1 are essentially identical with an overall r.m.s.d. of 0.5 Å except for the last two ANK repeats (R4 and R5; Fig. 6A). The backbones of the N-terminal helices of R4 and R5 show shifts of 2 and 1 Å, respectively, due at least in part to the charge attraction of Glu-1318KANK1 to Arg-1157KIF21A in the complex (Fig. 5B). This conformational change results in closer packing between R3 and R4 and between R4 and R5, thereby leading to the more compact fold of the ANKRD with bound KIF21A. To test the KIF21A-binding effect on the folding of the ANKRD, we measured the thermal stability of KANK1_ANKRD in the absence or presence of the KIF21A_H peptide using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig. 6C). In line with our prediction, addition of the peptide significantly increased the melting temperature (Tm) of the KANK1_ANKRD protein by ∼2 °C. As the KIF21A_H peptide alone shows little CD signal (Fig. S3), we propose that the thermal stability increase is due to the binding-induced conformational change. We also compared the apo structure of KANK1_ANKRD with the publicly available apo structure of KANK2_ANKRD. The overall structural difference is relatively large (an overall r.m.s.d. of 1.5 Å for 232 aligned residues; Fig. 6D, inset). Interestingly, however, the C-terminal R3–5 regions can be locally superposed with an r.m.s.d. of 0.5 Å for 96 aligned residues (Fig. 6D). Compared with KANK1, the N-terminal R0–2 region in KANK2 shows a ∼6° rotation (Fig. 6D), presumably due to the different packing in the R2/3 interface. As shown in Fig. 6E, Val-754KANK2 is substituted in KANK1 by a methionine (Met-1257KANK1), which has a much longer side chain and thereby forces the convex parts of the R2 and R3 repeats to have a lar"
