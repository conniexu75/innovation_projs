https://openalex.org/W2292362441,"Tumor heterogeneity may reduce the efficacy of molecularly guided systemic therapy for cancers that have metastasized. To determine whether the genomic alterations in a single metastasis provide a reasonable assessment of the major oncogenic drivers of other dispersed metastases in an individual, we analyzed multiple tumors from men with disseminated prostate cancer through whole-exome sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and RNA transcript profiling, and we compared the genomic diversity within and between individuals. In contrast to the substantial heterogeneity between men, there was limited diversity among metastases within an individual. The number of somatic mutations, the burden of genomic copy number alterations and aberrations in known oncogenic drivers were all highly concordant, as were metrics of androgen receptor (AR) activity and cell cycle activity. AR activity was inversely associated with cell proliferation, whereas the expression of Fanconi anemia (FA)-complex genes was correlated with elevated cell cycle progression, expression of the E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and loss of retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Men with somatic aberrations in FA-complex genes or in ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM) exhibited significantly longer treatment-response durations to carboplatin than did men without defects in genes encoding DNA-repair proteins. Collectively, these data indicate that although exceptions exist, evaluating a single metastasis provides a reasonable assessment of the major oncogenic driver alterations that are present in disseminated tumors within an individual, and thus may be useful for selecting treatments on the basis of predicted molecular vulnerabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2289500363,"Neurovascular inflammation is a major contributor to many neurological disorders, but modeling these processes in vitro has proven to be difficult. Here, we microengineered a three-dimensional (3D) model of the human blood-brain barrier (BBB) within a microfluidic chip by creating a cylindrical collagen gel containing a central hollow lumen inside a microchannel, culturing primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells on the gel's inner surface, and flowing medium through the lumen. Studies were carried out with the engineered microvessel containing endothelium in the presence or absence of either primary human brain pericytes beneath the endothelium or primary human brain astrocytes within the surrounding collagen gel to explore the ability of this simplified model to identify distinct contributions of these supporting cells to the neuroinflammatory response. This human 3D BBB-on-a-chip exhibited barrier permeability similar to that observed in other in vitro BBB models created with non-human cells, and when stimulated with the inflammatory trigger, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), different secretion profiles for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were observed depending on the presence of astrocytes or pericytes. Importantly, the levels of these responses detected in the 3D BBB chip were significantly greater than when the same cells were co-cultured in static Transwell plates. Thus, as G-CSF and IL-6 have been reported to play important roles in neuroprotection and neuroactivation in vivo, this 3D BBB chip potentially offers a new method to study human neurovascular function and inflammation in vitro, and to identify physiological contributions of individual cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2291103326,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper-containing enzymes that oxidatively break down recalcitrant polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin. Since their discovery, LPMOs have become integral factors in the industrial utilization of biomass, especially in the sustainable generation of cellulosic bioethanol. We report here a structural determination of an LPMO-oligosaccharide complex, yielding detailed insights into the mechanism of action of these enzymes. Using a combination of structure and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we reveal the means by which LPMOs interact with saccharide substrates. We further uncover electronic and structural features of the enzyme active site, showing how LPMOs orchestrate the reaction of oxygen with polysaccharide chains."
https://openalex.org/W2294990791,"A method called PRISM rapidly identifies drug candidates that are effective against specific cancer cell lines. Hundreds of genetically characterized cell lines are available for the discovery of genotype-specific cancer vulnerabilities. However, screening large numbers of compounds against large numbers of cell lines is currently impractical, and such experiments are often difficult to control1,2,3,4. Here we report a method called PRISM that allows pooled screening of mixtures of cancer cell lines by labeling each cell line with 24-nucleotide barcodes. PRISM revealed the expected patterns of cell killing seen in conventional (unpooled) assays. In a screen of 102 cell lines across 8,400 compounds, PRISM led to the identification of BRD-7880 as a potent and highly specific inhibitor of aurora kinases B and C. Cell line pools also efficiently formed tumors as xenografts, and PRISM recapitulated the expected pattern of erlotinib sensitivity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2290125147,"The vertebrate body plan and organs are shaped during a conserved embryonic phase called the phylotypic stage. However, the mechanisms that guide the epigenome through this transition and their evolutionary conservation remain elusive. Here we report widespread DNA demethylation of enhancers during the phylotypic period in zebrafish, Xenopus tropicalis and mouse. These enhancers are linked to developmental genes that display coordinated transcriptional and epigenomic changes in the diverse vertebrates during embryogenesis. Binding of Tet proteins to (hydroxy)methylated DNA and enrichment of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in these regions implicated active DNA demethylation in this process. Furthermore, loss of function of Tet1, Tet2 and Tet3 in zebrafish reduced chromatin accessibility and increased methylation levels specifically at these enhancers, indicative of DNA methylation being an upstream regulator of phylotypic enhancer function. Overall, our study highlights a regulatory module associated with the most conserved phase of vertebrate embryogenesis and suggests an ancient developmental role for Tet dioxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W2291712547,"How vascular tubes build, maintain and adapt continuously perfused lumens to meet local metabolic needs remains poorly understood. Recent studies showed that blood flow itself plays a critical role in the remodelling of vascular networks, and suggested it is also required for the lumenization of new vascular connections. However, it is still unknown how haemodynamic forces contribute to the formation of new vascular lumens during blood vessel morphogenesis. Here we report that blood flow drives lumen expansion during sprouting angiogenesis in vivo by inducing spherical deformations of the apical membrane of endothelial cells, in a process that we have termed inverse blebbing. We show that endothelial cells react to these membrane intrusions by local and transient recruitment and contraction of actomyosin, and that this mechanism is required for single, unidirectional lumen expansion in angiogenic sprouts. Our work identifies inverse membrane blebbing as a cellular response to high external pressure. We show that in the case of blood vessels such membrane dynamics can drive local cell shape changes required for global tissue morphogenesis, shedding light on a pressure-driven mechanism of lumen formation in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2288968461,"Mutations in CHD7, encoding ATP-dependent chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7, in CHARGE syndrome lead to multiple congenital anomalies, including craniofacial malformations, neurological dysfunction and growth delay. Mechanisms underlying the CNS phenotypes remain poorly understood. We found that Chd7 is a direct transcriptional target of oligodendrogenesis-promoting factors Olig2 and Smarca4/Brg1 and is required for proper onset of CNS myelination and remyelination. Genome-occupancy analyses in mice, coupled with transcriptome profiling, revealed that Chd7 interacted with Sox10 and targeted the enhancers of key myelinogenic genes. These analyses identified previously unknown Chd7 targets, including bone formation regulators Osterix (also known as Sp7) and Creb3l2, which are also critical for oligodendrocyte maturation. Thus, Chd7 coordinates with Sox10 to regulate the initiation of myelinogenesis and acts as a molecular nexus of regulatory networks that account for the development of a seemingly diverse array of lineages, including oligodendrocytes and osteoblasts, pointing to previously uncharacterized Chd7 functions in white matter pathogenesis in CHARGE syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W2290753804,"Astrocytes isolated from individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are toxic to motor neurons (MNs) and play a non-cell autonomous role in disease pathogenesis. The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of MNs to cell death remain unclear. Here we report that astrocytes derived from either mice bearing mutations in genes associated with ALS or human subjects with ALS reduce the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecules on MNs; reduced MHCI expression makes these MNs susceptible to astrocyte-induced cell death. Increasing MHCI expression on MNs increases survival and motor performance in a mouse model of ALS and protects MNs against astrocyte toxicity. Overexpression of a single MHCI molecule, HLA-F, protects human MNs from ALS astrocyte-mediated toxicity, whereas knockdown of its receptor, the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor KIR3DL2, on human astrocytes results in enhanced MN death. Thus, our data indicate that, in ALS, loss of MHCI expression on MNs renders them more vulnerable to astrocyte-mediated toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2290000470,"Twenty-four hour rhythms in behavior are organized by a network of circadian pacemaker neurons. Rhythmic activity in this network is generated by intrinsic rhythms in clock neuron physiology and communication between clock neurons. However, it is poorly understood how the activity of a small number of pacemaker neurons is translated into rhythmic behavior of the whole animal. To understand this, we screened for signals that could identify circadian output circuits in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that leucokinin neuropeptide (LK) and its receptor (LK-R) were required for normal behavioral rhythms. This LK/LK-R circuit connects pacemaker neurons to brain areas that regulate locomotor activity and sleep. Our experiments revealed that pacemaker neurons impose rhythmic activity and excitability on LK- and LK-R-expressing neurons. We also found pacemaker neuron-dependent activity rhythms in a second circadian output pathway controlled by DH44 neuropeptide-expressing neurons. We conclude that rhythmic clock neuron activity propagates to multiple downstream circuits to orchestrate behavioral rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W2291388628,"Probes of E3 ligase transthiolation activity reveal the hierarchy of phosphorylation events leading to cellular parkin activation and show that disease-linked parkin mutants have impaired transthiolation activity. E3 ligases represent an important class of enzymes, yet there are currently no chemical probes for profiling their activity. We develop a new class of activity-based probe by re-engineering a ubiquitin-charged E2 conjugating enzyme and demonstrate the utility of these probes by profiling the transthiolation activity of the RING-in-between-RING (RBR) E3 ligase parkin in vitro and in cellular extracts. Our study provides valuable insight into the roles, and cellular hierarchy, of distinct phosphorylation events in parkin activation. We also profile parkin mutations associated with patients with Parkinson's disease and demonstrate that they mediate their effect largely by altering transthiolation activity. Furthermore, our probes enable direct and quantitative measurement of endogenous parkin activity, revealing that endogenous parkin is activated in neuronal cell lines (≥75%) in response to mitochondrial depolarization. This new technology also holds promise as a novel biomarker of PINK1-parkin signaling, as demonstrated by its compatibility with samples derived from individuals with Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2290797956,"Head circumference is used together with other measures as a proxy for central nervous system damage in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, yet the relationship between head circumference and brain volume has not been investigated in this population. The objective of this study is to characterize the relationship between head circumference, brain volume and cognitive performance in a large sample of children with prenatal alcohol exposure (n = 144) and healthy controls (n = 145), aged 5-19 years. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging to yield brain volumes and head circumference, normalized to control for age and sex. Mean head circumference, brain volume, and cognitive scores were significantly reduced in the prenatal alcohol exposure group relative to controls, albeit with considerable overlap between groups. Males with prenatal alcohol exposure had reductions in all three measures, whereas females with prenatal alcohol exposure had reduced brain volumes and cognitive scores, but no difference in head circumference relative to controls. Microcephaly (defined here as head circumference ≤ 3rd percentile) occurred more often in prenatal alcohol exposed participants than controls, but 90% of the exposed sample had head circumferences above this clinical cutoff indicating that head circumference is not a sensitive marker of prenatal alcohol exposure. Normalized head circumference and brain volume were positively correlated in both groups, and subjects with very low head circumference typically had below-average brain volumes. Conversely, over half of the subjects with very low brain volumes had normal head circumferences, which may stem from differential effects of alcohol on the skeletal and nervous systems. There were no significant correlations between head circumference and any cognitive score. These findings confirm group-level reductions in head circumference and increased rates of microcephaly in children with prenatal alcohol exposure, but raise concerns about the predictive value of this metric at an individual-subject level."
https://openalex.org/W2289727001,"Background Paucity of data on the prevalence, treatment and control of hypertension in individuals living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the rural communities of South Africa may undermine efforts to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases. This study examines the socio-demographic and clinical determinants of uncontrolled hypertension among individuals living with T2DM in the rural communities of Mthatha, South Africa. Methods This cross-sectional study involved a serially selected sample of 265 individuals living with T2DM and hypertension at Mthatha General Hospital, Mthatha. Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 140mmHg and diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90mmHg in accordance with the Eight Joint National Committee Report (JNC 8) (2014). We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify the significant determinants of uncontrolled hypertension. Results Of the total participants (n = 265), the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension was 75.5% (n = 200). In univariate analysis of all participants, male gender (p = 0.029), age≥65 years (p = 0.016), unemployed status (p<0.0001), excessive alcohol intake (p = 0.005) and consumption of western-type diet (p<0.0001) were positively associated with uncontrolled hypertension. In multivariate logistic regression (LR method) analysis, unemployed status (p<0.0001), excessive alcohol intake (p = 0.007) and consumption of western-type diet (p<0.0001) were independently and significantly associated with uncontrolled hypertension. There is significant association between increasing number and classes of anti-hypertensive drugs and uncontrolled hypertension (p = 0.05 and 0.02, respectively). Conclusion Prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension was high in individuals with concomitant hypertension and T2DM in the study population. Male sex, aging, clinic inertia, unemployed status and nutritional transitions are the most important determinants of uncontrolled hypertension in T2DM in Mthatha, South Africa. Treatment to blood pressure targets, though feasible in our setting, would require concerted efforts by addressing these determinants and clinic inertia."
https://openalex.org/W2290947852,"The covalent conjugation of ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) to proteins generates a signal that regulates transcription, response to cell stress, and differentiation. Ufmylation is initiated by ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 5 (UBA5), which activates and transfers UFM1 to ubiquitin-fold modifier-conjugating enzyme 1 (UFC1). The details of the interaction between UFM1 and UBA5 required for UFM1 activation and its downstream transfer are however unclear. In this study, we described and characterized a combined linear LC3-interacting region/UFM1-interacting motif (LIR/UFIM) within the C terminus of UBA5. This single motif ensures that UBA5 binds both UFM1 and light chain 3/γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated proteins (LC3/GABARAP), two ubiquitin (Ub)-like proteins. We demonstrated that LIR/UFIM is required for the full biological activity of UBA5 and for the effective transfer of UFM1 onto UFC1 and a downstream protein substrate both in vitro and in cells. Taken together, our study provides important structural and functional insights into the interaction between UBA5 and Ub-like modifiers, improving the understanding of the biology of the ufmylation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2292714180,"VTX-2337 (USAN: motolimod) is a selective toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist, which is in clinical development as an immunotherapy for multiple oncology indications, including squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Activation of TLR8 enhances natural killer cell activation, increases antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and induces Th1 polarizing cytokines. Here, we show that VTX-2337 stimulates the release of mature IL-1β and IL-18 from monocytic cells through coordinated actions on both TLR8 and the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome complex. In vitro, VTX-2337 primed monocytic cells to produce pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and caspase-1, and also activated the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mediating the release of mature IL-1β family cytokines. Inhibition of caspase-1 blocked VTX-2337-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, but had little impact on production of other TLR8-induced mediators such as TNFα. IL-18 activated natural killer cells and complemented other stimulatory pathways, including FcγRIII and NKG2D, resulting in IFNγ production and expression of CD107a. NLRP3 activation in vivo was confirmed by a dose-related increase in plasma IL-1β and IL-18 levels in cynomolgus monkeys administered VTX-2337. These results are highly relevant to clinical studies of combination VTX-2337/cetuximab treatment. Cetuximab, a clinically approved, epidermal growth factor receptor-specific monoclonal antibody, activates NK cells through interactions with FcγRIII and facilitates ADCC of tumor cells. Our preliminary findings from a Phase I open-label, dose-escalation, trial that enrolled 13 patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN show that patient NK cells become more responsive to stimulation by NKG2D or FcγRIII following VTX-2337 treatment. Together, these results indicate that TLR8 stimulation and inflammasome activation by VTX-2337 can complement FcγRIII engagement and may augment clinical responses in SCCHN patients treated with cetuximab.

Despite its functional significance, the molecular mechanism of GnIH action in the target cells has not been fully elucidated. To expand our previous study on GnIH actions in gonadotropes, we investigated the potential signal transduction pathway that conveys the inhibitory action of GnIH in GnRH neurons by using the GnRH neuronal cell line, GT1–7. We examined whether GnIH inhibits the action of kisspeptin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), positive regulators of GnRH neurons. Although GnIH significantly suppressed the stimulatory effect of kisspeptin on GnRH release in hypothalamic culture, GnIH had no inhibitory effect on kisspeptin stimulation of serum response element and nuclear factor of activated T-cell response element activities and ERK phosphorylation, indicating that GnIH may not directly inhibit kisspeptin signaling in GnRH neurons. On the contrary, GnIH effectively eliminated the stimulatory effect of VIP on p38 and ERK phosphorylation, c-Fos mRNA expression, and GnRH release. The use of pharmacological modulators strongly demonstrated the specific inhibitory action of GnIH on the adenylate cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway, suggesting a common inhibitory mechanism of GnIH action in GnRH neurons and gonadotropes.—Son, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2291987913,"In addition to the well-known light-driven outward proton pumps, novel ion-pumping rhodopsins functioning as outward Na+ and inward Cl− pumps have been recently found in eubacteria. They convert light energy into transmembrane electrochemical potential difference, similar to the prototypical archaeal H+ pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and Cl− pump halorhodopsin (HR). The H+, Na+, and Cl− pumps possess the conserved respective DTE, NDQ, and NTQ motifs in the helix C, which likely serve as their functional determinants. To verify this hypothesis, we attempted functional interconversion between selected pumps from each category by mutagenesis. Introduction of the proton-pumping motif resulted in successful Na+ → H+ functional conversion. Introduction of the respective characteristic motifs with several additional mutations leads to successful Na+ → Cl− and Cl− → H+ functional conversions, whereas remaining conversions (H+ → Na+, H+ → Cl−, Cl− → Na+) were unsuccessful when mutagenesis of 4–6 residues was used. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that a H+ pump is the common ancestor of all of these rhodopsins, from which Cl− pumps emerged followed by Na+ pumps. We propose that successful functional conversions of these ion pumps are achieved exclusively when mutagenesis reverses the evolutionary amino acid sequence changes. Dependence of the observed functional conversions on the direction of evolution strongly suggests that the essential structural mechanism of an ancestral function is retained even after the gain of a new function during natural evolution, which can be evoked by a few mutations. By contrast, the gain of a new function needs accumulation of multiple mutations, which may not be easily reproduced by limited mutagenesis in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2291664248,"There are now many methods available to assess the relative citation performance of peer-reviewed journals. Regardless of their individual faults and advantages, citation-based metrics are used by researchers to maximize the citation potential of their articles, and by employers to rank academic track records. The absolute value of any particular index is arguably meaningless unless compared to other journals, and different metrics result in divergent rankings. To provide a simple yet more objective way to rank journals within and among disciplines, we developed a κ-resampled composite journal rank incorporating five popular citation indices: Impact Factor, Immediacy Index, Source-Normalized Impact Per Paper, SCImago Journal Rank and Google 5-year h-index; this approach provides an index of relative rank uncertainty. We applied the approach to six sample sets of scientific journals from Ecology (n = 100 journals), Medicine (n = 100), Multidisciplinary (n = 50); Ecology + Multidisciplinary (n = 25), Obstetrics & Gynaecology (n = 25) and Marine Biology & Fisheries (n = 25). We then cross-compared the κ-resampled ranking for the Ecology + Multidisciplinary journal set to the results of a survey of 188 publishing ecologists who were asked to rank the same journals, and found a 0.68-0.84 Spearman's ρ correlation between the two rankings datasets. Our composite index approach therefore approximates relative journal reputation, at least for that discipline. Agglomerative and divisive clustering and multi-dimensional scaling techniques applied to the Ecology + Multidisciplinary journal set identified specific clusters of similarly ranked journals, with only Nature & Science separating out from the others. When comparing a selection of journals within or among disciplines, we recommend collecting multiple citation-based metrics for a sample of relevant and realistic journals to calculate the composite rankings and their relative uncertainty windows."
https://openalex.org/W2289093606,"Mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) must be assembled precisely from 45 protein subunits for it to function correctly. One of its mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunits, ND1, is incorporated during the early stages of complex I assembly. However, little is known about how mutations in ND1 affect this assembly process. We found that in human 143B cybrid cells carrying a homoplasmic MT-ND1 mutation, ND1 protein could not be translated. As a result, the early stages of complex I assembly were disrupted, with mature complex I undetectable and complex I–linked respiration severely reduced to 2.0% of control levels. Interestingly, complex IV (ferrocytochrome c:oxygen oxidoreductase) steady-state levels were also reduced to 40.3%, possibly due to its diminished stability in the absence of respiratory supercomplex formation. This was in comparison with 143B cybrid controls (that contained wild-type mtDNA on the same nuclear background), which exhibited normal complex I, complex IV, and supercomplex assembly. We conclude that the loss of ND1 stalls complex I assembly during the early stages of its biogenesis, which not only results in the loss of mature complex I but also disrupts the stability of complex IV and the respiratory supercomplex to cause mitochondrial dysfunction.—Lim, S.

Samples were collected from fermenter liquids at 0, 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 h and from feed residues at 0, 24, and 48 h after initiation of incubation (period 1) and on day 13 (period 2). Microbial DNA was extracted and real-time qPCR was used to quantify differences in the abundance of protozoa, methanogens, total bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Prevotella bryantii, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Clostridium aminophilum. We found that forage source and sampling time significantly influenced the ruminal microbial community. The gene copy numbers of most microbial species (except C. aminophilum) decreased in period 1; however, adaption continued through period 2 for several species. The addition of fresh substrate in period 2 led to increasing copy numbers of all microbial species during the first 2–4 h in the fermenter liquid except protozoa, which showed a postprandial decrease. Corn silage enhanced the growth of R. amylophilus and F. succinogenes, and grass silage enhanced R. albus, P. bryantii, and C. aminophilum. No effect of forage source was detected on total bacteria, protozoa, S. ruminantium, or methanogens or on total gas production, although grass silage enhanced methane production. This study showed that the Rusitec provides a stable system after an adaption phase that should last longer than 48 h, and that the forage source influenced several microbial species."

Osmotic swelling significantly increases DRG neuron mechano-excitability such that a subthreshold mechanical stimulus can result in action potential firing. Behaviorally, the mechanical hind paw withdrawal threshold in rats is reduced following the injection of a hypotonic solution, but this osmotic effect is abolished when cytochalasin D or Gd3+ is co-administered with the hypo-osmotic solution.

Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels.Science. 2010; 330: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). RA-MA currents are found to be mediated by nonselective cation channels (7.McCarter G.C. Levine J.D. Ionic basis of a mechanotransduction current in adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons.Mol. Pain. 2006; 2: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and they can be blocked by Gd3+ and ruthenium red (1.McCarter G.C. Reichling D.B. Levine J.D.

Distinct mechanosensitive properties of capsaicin-sensitive and -insensitive sensory neurons.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: RC228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RA-MA currents have been recorded from different DRG neurons, some of which feature non-nociceptive characteristics, whereas others show nociceptive properties (2.Drew L.J. Wood J.N. Cesare P. Distinct mechanosensitive properties of capsaicin-sensitive and -insensitive sensory neurons.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: RC228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that they may be involved in both non-nociceptive and nociceptive mechanical transduction. The molecular identity conferring RA-MA currents in primary afferent neurons has recently been elucidated to be Piezo2, a large transmembrane protein that forms mechanically sensitive ion channels in mammalian primary afferents (6.Coste B. Mathur J. Schmidt M. Earley T.J. Ranade S. Petrus M.J. Dubin A.E. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels.Science. 2010; 330: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Piezo2 channels are also expressed on Merkel cells of hair follicles and touch domes of the skin, where they are key molecules for the transduction of gentle touch (8.Ikeda R. Cha M. Ling J. Jia Z.

The role of Piezo2 channels in animal behavioral responses to mechanical stimuli has recently been demonstrated using Piezo2 knock-out mice (11.Ranade S.S. Woo S.H. Dubin A.E. Moshourab R.A.

In primary afferent neurons, studies have shown that RA-MA currents are up-regulated by a transcriptional mechanism by the proinflammatory neurotrophin nerve growth factor (12.Di Castro A. Drew L.J. Wood J.N. Cesare P. Modulation of sensory neuron mechanotransduction by PKC- and nerve growth factor-dependent pathways.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4699-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Activators of PKC, given in vitro and in vivo, also cause increases in RA-MA currents and behavioral sensitization to mechanical stimulation, respectively (12.Di Castro A. Drew L.J. Wood J.N. Cesare P. Modulation of sensory neuron mechanotransduction by PKC- and nerve growth factor-dependent pathways.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4699-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In a heterologous expression system, Piezo2 current amplitude is shown to be increased by bradykinin receptor β2 activation, and the up-regulation of Piezo2 function is shown to be mediated by protein kinase A and protein kinase C (13.Dubin A.E. Schmidt M. Mathur J. Petrus M.J. Xiao B. Coste B. Patapoutian A. Inflammatory signals enhance piezo2-mediated mechanosensitive currents.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 511-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A GTP-dependent run-up of Piezo2-type RA-MA currents is observed in cultured DRG neurons (14.Jia Z. Ikeda R. Ling J. Gu J.G. GTP-dependent run-up of Piezo2-type mechanically activated currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons.Mol. Brain. 2013; 6: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, a role for Piezo2 in EPAC1-dependent mechanical allodynia has been reported recently (15.Eijkelkamp N. Linley J.E. Torres J.M. Bee L. Dickenson A.H. Gringhuis M. Minett M.S. Hong G.S. Lee E. Oh U. Ishikawa Y. Zwartkuis F.J. Cox J.J. Wood J.N. A role for Piezo2 in EPAC1-dependent mechanical allodynia.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of mechanotransduction at primary afferent nerve endings has been proposed to be a mechanism underlying mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia, exaggerated pain states induced by gentle touch and mild noxious stimuli, respectively, seen under pathological conditions. Previous studies on the regulation of Piezo2 channel functions have mainly focused on biochemical aspects such as modulation by second messengers. However, an emerging field of research on ion channel regulation in recent years has been to explore the impact of membrane biophysical properties on the activity of different ion channels (16.Reeves D. Ursell T. Sens P. Kondev J. Phillips R. Membrane mechanics as a probe of ion-channel gating mechanisms.Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft. Matter Phys. 2008; 78 (041901)Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17.Diz-Muñoz A. Fletcher D.A. Weiner O.D. Use the force: membrane tension as an organizer of cell shape and motility.Trends Cell Biol. 2013; 23: 47-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). It has been shown that membrane biophysical properties such as static plasma membrane tension (SPMT) have a significant impact on functions of some ion channels ranging from directly gating (e.g. bacterial MscL) to influencing voltage-gating (e.g. some voltage-gated K+ channels) and ligand-gating (e.g. NMDA receptors) (16.Reeves D.

Mechanosensitivity of NMDA receptors in cultured mouse central neurons.Neuron. 1994; 13: 645-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It is probably not totally unexpected that Piezo2 functions can be regulated by SPMT, but so far it has been unknown to what extent this biophysical factor may change the sensitivity of Piezo2 mechanotranduction in sensory neurons. In this study, we use osmotic swelling as a means to increase SPMT (19.Morris C.E. Homann U. Cell surface area regulation and membrane tension.J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 179: 79-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 20.Dai J. Sheetz M.P. Wan X. Morris C.E. Membrane tension in swelling and shrinking molluscan neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6681-6692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we show that SPMT has a profound impact on Piezo2-mediated currents. Sprague-Dawley rats (250–350 g, both genders) were used. Animal care and use conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Cincinnati. DRG neuron cultures were prepared as described previously (21.Tsuzuki K. Xing H. Ling J. Gu J.G. Menthol-induced Ca2+ release from presynaptic Ca2+ stores potentiates sensory synaptic transmission.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In brief, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed by decapitation. DRGs were rapidly dissected out bilaterally and incubated with 0.2% collagenase and 0.5% dispase for 1 h at 37 °C in minimum essential medium for suspension culture (Invitrogen). After trituration to dissociate neurons, DRG neurons were plated on glass coverslips pre-coated with poly-d-lysine (12.5 μg/ml in distilled H2O) and laminin (20 μg/ml in Hanks' buffered salt solution, BD Biosciences). The cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) that also contained nerve growth factor (2.5S NGF; 10 ng/ml; Roche Applied Science), 5% heat-inactivated horse serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), uridine/5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (10 μm), 8 mg/ml glucose, and 1% vitamin solution (Invitrogen). The cultures were maintained in an incubator at 37 °C with a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were used for patch clamp recordings after culturing for 3–7 days. To perform patch clamp recordings, coverslips with cultured neurons were placed in a 0.5-ml microchamber, mounted on a stage of an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (Olympus), and continuously perfused at 2 ml/min with a normal bath solution at a room temperature of 23 °C. The normal bath was an isotonic solution that contained (in mm) 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, and an osmolarity of 320 mosm. Normal patch clamp recording internal solution was an isotonic solution that contained (in mm) 70 Cs2SO4, 5 KCl, 2.4 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 5 EGTA, 10.0 HEPES, 5.0 Na2ATP, 0.33 GTP-Tris salt; pH was adjusted to 7.35 with CsOH, and osmolarity was adjusted with sucrose to 320 mosm. Recording electrodes were fabricated from thin wall capillaries using a Flaming/Brown P-97 puller (Sutter Instrument Co. Novato, CA). Resistances of electrodes were 4–6 megohms after filling recording internal solutions. Membrane access resistance after establishing the whole-cell configuration was ∼10 megohms and was not compensated. Junction potential between bath and electrode solution was calculated to be 11 mV and was corrected for the data analysis. Voltage clamp recordings were performed with cells held at −71 mV (command voltage of −60 mV minus 11 mV for junction potential correction). Signals were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, filtered at 2 kHz, and sampled at 5 kHz using pCLAMP 9.0 (Axon Instruments). Unless otherwise indicated, all recordings were performed on small-sized DRG neurons ranging from 20 to 30 μm in diameter. To apply mechanical stimulation, the membranes of DRG cell bodies were displaced by a heat-polished glass pipette (membrane displacement probe). The tip of the probe was ∼4 μm in diameter. The probe was positioned at an angle of 45° to the surface of the dish, and the movement of the probe was controlled by a piezo-electric device (Physik Instruments, Auburn, MA). The tip of the probe was positioned in such a way that a 2-μm movement did not contact the cell; 3 μm had a visible contact but little membrane movement, and a 4-μm stimulus produced an observable membrane deflection. Therefore, tip forward steps of 2 and 3 μm were assigned as position −1 and 0 μm, respectively; a 4-μm forward step was recorded as an initial step of 1-μm membrane displacement. The probe was moved at a speed of 0.5 μm/ms. Membrane displacements by the probe were visualized as live images, which were continuously captured by a CCD camera through a 40× objective and displayed on an 11-inch monitor throughout each experiment. To ensure the consistency of membrane displacement over a long recording time, under the visual guidance we corrected any drift of the probe just before applying mechanical stimulation in each test, and we further corrected the relative distance between the tip of the probe and the cell membrane when osmotic swelling was introduced to the recorded cells. For most recordings, a fixed membrane displacement (6 or 7 μm, 500-ms duration) was applied immediately after breaking into the whole-cell mode and then continually applied at an interval of 2 min for up to 30 min. In some experiments, a series of graded membrane displacement steps were applied at 1-μm increments, and the duration of each step was 500 ms. The interval was 6 s when the displacement steps were applied. Assessment of RA-MA channel numbers and unitary current size was performed using the nonstationary fluctuation analysis described in our previous study (22.Ikeda R. Gu J.G. Piezo2 channel conductance and localization domains in Merkel cells of rat whisker hair follicles.Neurosci. Lett. 2014; 583: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, RA-MA currents were repeatedly evoked by the same membrane displacement of 7 μm for up to 30 times. Current variances during multiple stimulations were plotted against mean current values. The channel numbers and unitary current size were obtained by fitting data into the equation, σ2 = i·I − I2/N, where σ2 is current variance; i is unitary current size; I is mean value of currents, and N is channel numbers. Because membrane displacement might affect membrane seal to change access resistance, membrane properties were continually monitored during each recording. This was achieved by applying 5-mV test pulses. Data were discarded if membrane access resistance changed during recordings. To determine the effects of osmotic swelling on RA-MA currents in cultured DRG neurons, osmotic swelling was produced by either intracellular hypertonicity (for most experiments) or extracellular hypotonicity. Osmotic swelling was determined by measuring the increases of cell diameters over time following the introduction of intracellular hypertonicity or extracellular hypotonicity. For intracellular hypertonicity, hypertonic recording internal solution was used, and the solution was similar to normal recording internal solution except the osmolarity was adjusted with sucrose to 420 mosm. To determine the effects of intracellular BAPTA on RA-MA currents, 20 mm BAPTA was included in the hypertonic recording internal solution. In some experiments to elicit neuronal action potentials while intracellular hypertonicity was introduced, the recording internal solution was similar to the normal recording internal solution except 70 mm Cs2SO4 was replaced by 135 mm potassium gluconate, and pH was adjusted with KOH to 7.3 and osmolarity adjusted with sucrose to 420 mosm. In experiments to introduce hypotonicity extracellularly, hypotonic solution with osmolarity of 220 mosm was used, and the solution was similar to normal bath solution except NaCl concentration was reduced from 145 to 90 mm. In one set of experiments, the TRPV4 activator GSK1016790A was tested for its effect on RA-MA currents. RA-MA currents were recorded using isotonic recording internal solution, and GSK1016790A (100 nm) was continuously applied through a bath for up to 30 min. In experiments to determine the role of actin filaments in RA-MA channel functions, cytochalasin D (CD, 10 μm), latrunculin A (LatA, 5 μm), or jasplakinolide (Jasp, 5 μm) was applied intracellularly by including each of them in the recording internal solution. In some experiments, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells that heterologously expressed mouse Piezo2 ion channels were tested. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated onto 12-mm round glass coverslips placed in 12-well plates. Mouse Piezo2 plasmids (2 μg/well) were co-transfected with GFP plasmids (0.3 μg/ml) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Transfected cells were identified and recorded 12–24 h following the transfection. Mechanically activated currents in Piezo2-expressing HEK293 cells were recorded under the conventional whole-cell mode either with normal patch clamp recording internal solution or hypertonic recording internal solution. Mechanical stimulation was applied in the same fashion as that in the recordings of RA-MA currents from cultured DRG neurons. Immunostaining was performed to examine Piezo2 channel expression on cultured DRG neurons. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution and further incubated for 2 h in a mixture solution of 0.4% Triton X-100 and 4% paraformaldehyde. After three rinses with PBS, the cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a 2% Triton X-100 solution. The cells were rinsed two times with a 1% goat serum PBS and then incubated for 1 h in a solution of 4.5% normal goat serum in PBS with 0.4% Triton X-100 to block nonspecific antibody binding. The cells were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-Piezo2 antibody (1:500; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) overnight at 4 °C. Following three rinses with 1% goat serum PBS solution, the cells were further incubated with a secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody (1:1000 in 1% goat serum PBS solution) was a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were rinsed three times with 1% goat serum PBS solution, coverslipped with a glycerol-based anti-photobleach medium. Cell images were taken under an epifluorescent or a confocal fluorescent microscope. Fluorescent intensity values were measured at the perimeters and also at the sites on cells ∼5 μm away from the perimeters. The ratio of fluorescent intensities between these two locations was then calculated. Changes of membrane tension in cultured DRG neurons during osmotic swelling were determined by using the micropipette aspiration technique as described previously (23.Hochmuth R.M. Micropipette aspiration of living cells.J. Biomech. 2000; 33: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 24.Oh M.J. Kuhr F. Byfield F. Levitan I. Micropipette aspiration of substrate-attached cells to estimate cell stiffness.J. Vis. Exp. 2012; 67: 3886Google Scholar). In brief, micropipette was pulled from thin wall borosilicate glass capillaries (∼1.5 mm external diameter and ∼1.4 mm internal diameter) using Flaming/Brown P-97 puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). The tips of the micropipettes ranged between5 and 8 μm internal diameter depending on cell sizes, and the shape of the tip of each micropipette was in a cylindrical tube at a length of about 10 μm. The tips of the micropipettes were smoothed, and the shank of the tip was bent into a 45° angle. Micropipettes were usually prepared on the day of the experiment. Micropipettes were filled with bath solution that contained 5% horse serum to allow the cell membrane to move smoothly into the micropipette during aspiration. The micropipette was affixed on a head stage of a high speed pressure clamp (HSPC) device, and the head stage was mounted on a holder of a micromanipulator to allow fine control of the position of the micropipette. At the beginning of each experiment, the pressure in the pipette was equilibrated to the atmospheric pressure. Before aspirating cultured DRG neurons, the micropipette approached the cells at a 45° angle so that the shank of the micropipette tip was actually aligned horizontally to the focal plane while approaching the cells. Then the micropipette was moved toward a cell until the tip of the micropipette was in full contact with the membrane of the cell. To apply aspiration, steps of negative pressures were generated by HSPC device, and the negative pressures were delivered to the micropipette tip via the head stage of the HSPC. The HSPC was controlled, and pressure steps were programmed using pCLAMP 9.0 (Axon Instruments). Each negative pressure step was at 0.005 or 0.01 mm Hg and was applied until membrane projection was stabilized at a certain length before advancing to the next pressure step. A test for a single pressure step usually took ∼2 min. The negative pressure steps were continually applied to the cell until obtaining the negative pressure at which the membrane projection reached the length of the radius of the micropipette tip. During each negative pressure step, real time images of membrane deformation were acquired by a CCD camera and displayed on a 17-inch video monitor to track the membrane projection that was aspirated into the pipette. Membrane tension was determined based on the law of LaPlace and Young-LaPlace Equation 1 (23.Hochmuth R.M. Micropipette aspiration of living cells.J. Biomech. 2000; 33: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar), Pp=2Tc(1Rp−1Rc)(Eq. 1) where Tc is the plasma membrane tension; Rc is the radius of the cell outside the pipette; Rp is the radius of the pipette; Pp is the pipette pressure to result in Lp = Rp; Lp is the length of membrane projection in the pipette, and Pp = Pc (intracellular pressure) when Lp = Rp. The animal behavioral response to mechanical stimulation was examined using the von Frey test. In each test, a rat was placed in a transparent plastic chamber (length × width × height = 20 × 10 × 14 cm) suspended above a wire mesh platform (Ugo Basile, Italy). After habituation for 10 min, mechanical sensitivity of rat right hind paws was examined using the von Frey filaments (Ugo Basil, Italy). A series of von Frey filaments (force range from 0.16 to 26 g) were used sequentially in ascending order to push against the plantar surface of the hind paws. Each filament was applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw five times with a 10-s inter-trial interval. For each trial, the filament was applied until buckling of the filament occurred and was then held for 5 s. The mechanical hind paw withdrawal threshold was defined as the force value of a filament that produced ≥3 hind paw withdrawals in response to five stimuli. In each experiment, the baseline withdrawal threshold was first measured 15 min before the injection of testing compounds. The intraplantar hind paw of the rat was then injected with one of the following solutions in a volume of 100 μl: isotonic saline solution (310 mosm), 0.5% DMSO in isotonic saline solution; cytochalasin D (1 mm) in 0.5% DMSO isotonic saline solution; Gd3+ (0.3 mm) in isotonic saline solution; hypotonic saline solution (155 mosm); hypotonic saline solution plus cytochalasin D (1 mm). or hypotonic saline solution plus Gd3+ (0.3 mm). Withdrawal thresholds were then measured at 5, 15, 30, and 45 min after the injection. Cell diameters were measured from images captured by a digital camera, and a cell diameter was calculated as the average of the longest and shortest widths of the cell. Whole-cell recording data were analyzed using Clampfit 9 software. The threshold for eliciting RA-MA currents was defined as the minimum membrane displacement that evoked a visible inward RA-MA current.

To reveal the structural basis for substrate preference and the catalytic mechanism of SMYD3, we have solved its co-crystal structures with VEGFR1 and MAP3K2 peptides.

By contrast, SMYD3 displayed a weak activity toward a VEGFR1 peptide, and the location of the acceptor lysine in the folded kinase domain of VEGFR1 requires drastic conformational rearrangements for juxtaposition of the acceptor lysine with the enzymatic active site. Our results clearly revealed structural determinants for the substrate preference of SMYD3 and provided mechanistic insights into lysine methylation of MAP3K2.

Although intended to maintain the health status, several cases of adverse effects to Plant Food Supplements (PFS) have been described.To describe the self-reported adverse effects collected during the European PlantLIBRA PFS Consumer Survey 2011-2012, with a critical evaluation of the plausibility of the symptomatology reported using data from the literature and from the PlantLIBRA Poisons Centers' survey.From the total sample of 2359 consumers involved in the consumers' survey, 82 subjects reported adverse effects due to a total of 87 PFS.Cases were self-reported, therefore causality was not classified on the basis of clinical evidence, but by using the frequency/strength of adverse effects described in scientific papers: 52 out of 87 cases were defined as possible (59.8%) and 4 as probable (4.6%). Considering the most frequently cited botanicals, eight cases were due to Valeriana officinalis (garden valerian); seven to Camellia sinensis (tea); six to Ginkgo biloba (Maidenhair tree) and Paullinia cupana (guarana). Most adverse events related to the gastrointestinal tract, nervous and cardiovascular systems.Comparing the data from this study with those published in scientific papers and obtained by the PlantLIBRA Poisons Centers' survey, some important conclusions can be drawn: severe adverse effects to PFS are quite rare, although mild or moderate adverse symptoms can be present. Data reported in this paper can help health professionals (and in particular family doctors) to become aware of possible new problems associated with the increasing use of food supplements containing botanicals."
https://openalex.org/W2290465716,"Mosquito strains that exhibit increased tolerance to the chemical class of compounds with a sodium channel modulator mode of action (pyrethroids and pyrethrins) are typically described as ""pyrethroid resistant"". Resistance to pyrethroids is an increasingly important challenge in the control of mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria or dengue, because one of the main interventions (the distribution of large numbers of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets) currently relies entirely on long-lasting pyrethroids. Increasing tolerance of target insects against this class of insecticides lowers their impact in vector control. The current study suggests that the level of metabolic resistance depends on the structure of the molecule and that structurally different compounds may still be effective because detoxifying enzymes are unable to bind to these uncommon structures.Treated surface contact bioassays were performed on susceptible Aedes aegypti, East African knockdown resistance (kdr) Anopheles gambiae (strain RSP-H) and metabolically resistant Anopheles funestus (strain FUMOZ-R) with different pyrethroids, such as cypermethrin, ß-cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, permethrin and transfluthrin (alone and in combination with the synergist piperonyl butoxide). The nonfluorinated form of transfluthrin was also assessed as a single agent and in combination with piperonyl butoxide.Although the dosages for pyrethroids containing a phenoxybenzyl moiety have exhibited differences in terms of effectiveness among the three tested mosquito species, the structurally different transfluthrin with a polyfluorobenzyl moiety remained active in mosquitoes with upregulated P450 levels. In trials with transfluthrin mixed with piperonyl butoxide, the added synergist exhibited no efficacy-enhancing effect.The results of this study suggest that transfluthrin has the potential to control P450-mediated metabolically resistant mosquitoes because the structural formula of transfluthrin differs from that of the tested pyrethroids, which are used in vector control. The P450-detoxifying enzymes of the Anopheles funestus FUMOZ-R mosquitoes seem to bind preferably at the phenoxybenzyl moiety and appear to be unable to degrade transfluthrin with its tetrafluorobenzyl moiety. Inhibition of the class of monooxygenases by piperonyl butoxide revealed no increase of efficacy of the pure transfluthrin compound, which also indicates that the P450 enzymes potentially do not impact the efficacy of transfluthrin."
https://openalex.org/W2289141627,"Background Quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is key to increase survival from cardiac arrest. Providing chest compressions with adequate rate and depth is difficult even for well-trained rescuers. The use of real-time feedback devices is intended to contribute to enhance chest compression quality. These devices are typically based on the double integration of the acceleration to obtain the chest displacement during compressions. The integration process is inherently unstable and leads to important errors unless boundary conditions are applied for each compression cycle. Commercial solutions use additional reference signals to establish these conditions, requiring additional sensors. Our aim was to study the accuracy of three methods based solely on the acceleration signal to provide feedback on the compression rate and depth. Materials and Methods We simulated a CPR scenario with several volunteers grouped in couples providing chest compressions on a resuscitation manikin. Different target rates (80, 100, 120, and 140 compressions per minute) and a target depth of at least 50 mm were indicated. The manikin was equipped with a displacement sensor. The accelerometer was placed between the rescuer’s hands and the manikin’s chest. We designed three alternatives to direct integration based on different principles (linear filtering, analysis of velocity, and spectral analysis of acceleration). We evaluated their accuracy by comparing the estimated depth and rate with the values obtained from the reference displacement sensor. Results The median (IQR) percent error was 5.9% (2.8–10.3), 6.3% (2.9–11.3), and 2.5% (1.2–4.4) for depth and 1.7% (0.0–2.3), 0.0% (0.0–2.0), and 0.9% (0.4–1.6) for rate, respectively. Depth accuracy depended on the target rate (p < 0.001) and on the rescuer couple (p < 0.001) within each method. Conclusions Accurate feedback on chest compression depth and rate during CPR is possible using exclusively the chest acceleration signal. The algorithm based on spectral analysis showed the best performance. Despite these encouraging results, further research should be conducted to asses the performance of these algorithms with clinical data."

Alders are pioneer species that can tolerate and proliferate in nutrient-poor, contaminated environments, largely due to symbiotic root associations with the N2-fixing bacteria, Frankia and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. In this study, we investigated the growth of two Frankia-inoculated (actinorhizal) alder species, A. crispa and A. glutinosa, in gold mine waste rock from northern Quebec. Alder species had similar survival rates and positively impacted soil quality and physico-chemical properties in similar ways, restoring soil pH to neutrality and reducing extractable metals up to two-fold, while not hyperaccumulating them into above-ground plant biomass. A. glutinosa outperformed A. crispa in terms of growth, as estimated by the seedling volume index (SVI), and root length. Pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region for fungi provided a comprehensive, direct characterization of microbial communities in gold mine waste rock and fine tailings. Plant- and treatment-specific shifts in soil microbial community compositions were observed in planted mine residues. Shannon diversity and the abundance of microbes involved in key ecosystem processes such as contaminant degradation (Sphingomonas, Sphingobium and Pseudomonas), metal sequestration (Brevundimonas and Caulobacter) and N2-fixation (Azotobacter, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium and Pseudomonas) increased over time, i.e., as plants established in mine waste rock. Acetate mineralization and most probable number (MPN) assays showed that revegetation positively stimulated both bulk and rhizosphere communities, increasing microbial density (biomass increase of 2 orders of magnitude) and mineralization (five-fold). Genomic techniques proved useful in investigating tripartite (plant-bacteria-fungi) interactions during phytostabilization, contributing to our knowledge in this field of study."
https://openalex.org/W2292180855,"FoxO1 binds to insulin response elements located in the promoters of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), activating their expression. Insulin-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO1 promotes cytoplasmic translocation, inhibiting FoxO1-mediated transactivation. We have previously demonstrated that FoxO1 opens and remodels chromatin assembled from the IGFBP1 promoter via a highly conserved winged helix motif. This finding, which established FoxO1 as a factor, suggested a model whereby FoxO1 chromatin remodeling at regulatory targets facilitates binding and recruitment of additional regulatory factors. However, the impact of FoxO1 phosphorylation on its ability to bind chromatin and the effect of FoxO1 loss on recruitment of neighboring transcription factors at its regulatory targets in liver chromatin is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that an amino acid substitution that mimics insulin-mediated phosphorylation of a serine in the winged helix DNA binding motif curtails FoxO1 nucleosome binding. We also demonstrate that shRNA-mediated loss of FoxO1 binding to the IGFBP1 and G6Pase promoters in HepG2 cells significantly reduces binding of RNA polymerase II and the pioneer factors FoxA1/A2. Knockdown of FoxA1 similarly reduced binding of RNA polymerase II and FoxO1. Reduction in acetylation of histone H3 Lys-27 accompanies loss of FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 binding. Interdependent binding of FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 possibly entails cooperative binding because FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 facilitate one another's binding to IGFPB1 promoter DNA. These results illustrate how transcription factors can nucleate transcriptional events in chromatin in response to signaling events and suggest a model for regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism through interdependent FoxO/FoxA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2288457010,"Although previous research has demonstrated the key role of the oocyte-derived factors, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 15 and growth differentiation factor (GDF) 9, in follicular development and ovulation, there is a lack of knowledge on the impact of external factors, which females are exposed to during folliculogenesis, on their expression. The present study investigated the effect of the aphrodisiac Tribulus terrestris on the GDF9 and BMP15 expression in the oocytes and cumulus cells at mRNA and protein levels during folliculogenesis in two generations of female rabbits. The experiment was conducted with 28 New Zealand rabbits. Only the diet of the experimental mothers group was supplemented with a dry extract of T. terrestris for the 45 days prior to insemination. The expression of BMP15 and GDF9 genes in the oocytes and cumulus cells of mothers and F1 female offspring was analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The localization of the GDF9 and BMP15 proteins in the ovary tissues was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. The BMP15 and GDF9 transcripts were detected in the oocytes and cumulus cells of rabbits from all groups. T. terrestris caused a decrease in the BMP15 mRNA level in the oocytes and an increase in the cumulus cells. The GDF9 mRNA level increased significantly in both oocytes and cumulus cells. The downregulated expression of BMP15 in the treated mothers’ oocytes was inherited in the F1 female offspring born to treated mothers. BMP15 and GDF9 show a clearly expressed sensitivity to the bioactive compounds of T. terrestris."
https://openalex.org/W2290903322,"The association of complement with the progression of acute T cell mediated rejection (ATCMR) is not well understood. We investigated the production of complement components and the expression of complement regulatory proteins (Cregs) in acute T-cell mediated rejection using rat and human renal allografts.We prepared rat allograft and syngeneic graft models of renal transplantation. The expression of Complement components and Cregs was assessed in the rat grafts using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescent staining. We also administered anti-Crry and anti-CD59 antibodies to the rat allograft model. Further, we assessed the relationship between the expression of membrane cofactor protein (MCP) by immunohistochemical staining in human renal grafts and their clinical course.qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of Cregs, CD59 and rodent-specific complement regulator complement receptor 1-related gene/protein-y (Crry), was diminished in the rat allograft model especially on day 5 after transplantation in comparison with the syngeneic model. In contrast, the expression of complement components and receptors: C3, C3a receptor, C5a receptor, Factor B, C9, C1q, was increased, but not the expression of C4 and C5, indicating a possible activation of the alternative pathway. When anti-Crry and anti-CD59 mAbs were administered to the allograft, the survival period for each group was shortened. In the human ATCMR cases, the group with higher MCP expression in the grafts showed improved serum creatinine levels after the ATCMR treatment as well as a better 5-year graft survival rate.We conclude that the expression of Cregs in allografts is connected with ATCMR. Our results suggest that controlling complement activation in renal grafts can be a new strategy for the treatment of ATCMR."
https://openalex.org/W2291730977,"Near-perfect adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is required to achieve the best possible prevention and treatment outcomes. Yet, there have been particular concerns about the challenges of adherence among patients living in resource-limited settings in sub-Saharan Africa. The primary objective of this study was to explore adherence in a low-resourced, rural community of high HIV prevalence in South Africa and to identify specific individual and structural factors that can either challenge or support adherence in this context. We applied digital stories as a qualitative research tool to gain insights into personal contexts of HIV and ART adherence. Through an inductive thematic analysis of twenty story texts, soundtracks and drawings, we explored experiences, understandings, and contexts of the participants and identified potential barriers and facilitators for those on lifelong treatment. We found that many of the stories reflected a growing confidence in the effectiveness of ART, which should be viewed as a key facilitator to successful adherence since this attitude can promote disclosure and boost access to social support. Nevertheless, stories also highlighted the complexity of the issues that individuals and households face as they deal with HIV and ART in this setting and it is clear that an overburdened local healthcare system has often struggled to meet the demands of a rapidly expanding epidemic and to provide the necessary medical and emotional support. Our analysis suggests several opportunities for further research and the design of novel health interventions to support optimal adherence. Firstly, future health promotion campaigns should encourage individuals to test together, or at least accompany each other for testing, to encourage social support from the outset. Additionally, home-based testing and ART club interventions might be recommended to make it easier for individuals to adhere to their treatment regimens and to provide a sense of support and solidarity."
https://openalex.org/W2294379168,"In spring 2013, human infections with a novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were reported in China. The number of cases has increased with over 200 mortalities reported to date. However, there is currently no vaccine available for the H7 subtype of influenza A virus. Virus-specific cellular immune responses play a critical role in virus clearance during influenza infection. In this study, we undertook a side-by-side evaluation of two different adjuvants, Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (fliC) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), through intraperitoneal administration to assess their effects on the immunogenicity of the recombinant HA1-2 subunit vaccine of H7N9 influenza. The fusion protein HA1-2-fliC and HA1-2 combined with PEI could induce significantly higher HA1-2-specific IgG and hemagglutination inhibition titers than HA1-2 alone at 12 days post-boost, with superior HA1-2 specific IgG titers in the HA1-2-fliC group compared with the PEI adjuvanted group. The PEI adjuvanted vaccine induced higher IgG1/IgG2a ratio and significantly increased numbers of IFN-γ- and IL-4-producing cells than HA1-2 alone, suggesting a mixed Th1/Th2-type cellular immune response with a Th2 bias. Meanwhile, the HA1-2-fliC induced higher IgG2a and IgG1 levels, which is indicative of a mixed Th1/Th2-type profile. Consistent with this, significant levels, and equal numbers, of IFN-γ- and IL-4-producing cells were detected after HA1-2-fliC vaccination. Moreover, the marked increase in CD69 expression and the proliferative index with the HA1-2-fliC and PEI adjuvanted vaccines indicated that both adjuvanted vaccine candidates effectively induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses. Taken together, our findings indicate that the two adjuvanted vaccine candidates elicit effective and HA1-2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, offering significant promise for the development of a successful recombinant HA1-2 subunit vaccine for H7N9 influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2288588602,"Cytochrome c oxidase assembly requires the synthesis of the mitochondria-encoded core subunits, Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3. In yeast, Pet54 protein is required to activate translation of the COX3 mRNA and to process the aI5β intron on the COX1 transcript. Here we report a third, novel function of Pet54 on Cox1 synthesis. We observed that Pet54 is necessary to achieve an efficient Cox1 synthesis. Translation of the COX1 mRNA is coupled to the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase by a mechanism that involves Mss51. This protein activates translation of the COX1 mRNA by acting on the COX1 5′-UTR, and, in addition, it interacts with the newly synthesized Cox1 protein in high molecular weight complexes that include the factors Coa3 and Cox14. Deletion of Pet54 decreased Cox1 synthesis, and, in contrast to what is commonly observed for other assembly mutants, double deletion of cox14 or coa3 did not recover Cox1 synthesis. Our results show that Pet54 is a positive regulator of Cox1 synthesis that renders Mss51 competent as a translational activator of the COX1 mRNA and that this role is independent of the assembly feedback regulatory loop of Cox1 synthesis. Pet54 may play a role in Mss51 hemylation/conformational change necessary for translational activity. Moreover, Pet54 physically interacts with the COX1 mRNA, and this binding was independent of the presence of Mss51."
https://openalex.org/W2292254948,"Background and Objectives Prolonged fatigue is common among employees, but the relationship between prolonged fatigue and job-related psychosocial factors is seldom studied. This study aimed (1) to assess the individual relations of physical condition, psychological condition, and job-related psychosocial factors to prolonged fatigue among employees, and (2) to clarify the associations between job-related psychosocial factors and prolonged fatigue using hierarchical regression when demographic characteristics, physical condition, and psychological condition were controlled. Methods A cross-sectional study was employed. A questionnaire was used to obtain information pertaining to demographic characteristics, physical condition (perceived physical health and exercise routine), psychological condition (perceived mental health and psychological distress), job-related psychosocial factors (job demand, job control, and workplace social support), and prolonged fatigue. Results A total of 3,109 employees were recruited. Using multiple regression with controlled demographic characteristics, psychological condition explained 52.0% of the variance in prolonged fatigue. Physical condition and job-related psychosocial factors had an adjusted R2 of 0.370 and 0.251, respectively. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that, among job-related psychosocial factors, job demand and job control showed significant associations with fatigue. Conclusion Our findings highlight the role of job demand and job control, in addition to the role of perceived physical health, perceived mental health, and psychological distress, in workers’ prolonged fatigue. However, more research is required to verify the causation among all the variables."

Gene loops are dynamic structures that juxtapose the 3′-ends of genes with their promoters. Several functions have been attributed to looping, including memory of recent transcriptional activity and polarity of transcription initiation. In this study, we investigated the relationship between gene loops and alternative poly(A)-site. Using the KlCYC1 gene of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, which includes a single promoter and two poly(A) sites separated by 394 nucleotides, we demonstrate in two yeast species the formation of alternative gene loops (L1 and L2) that juxtapose the KlCYC1 promoter with either proximal or distal 3′-end processing sites, resulting in the synthesis of short and long forms of KlCYC1 mRNA. Furthermore, synthesis of short and long mRNAs and formation of the L1 and L2 loops are growth phase-dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the Ssu72 RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain phosphatase, a critical determinant of looping, peaks in early log phase at the proximal poly(A) site, but as growth phase advances, it extends to the distal site.

These effects are likely to be a consequence of RNAP II “hand-off,” resulting in recycling of RNAP II from terminator to promoter. 3B. N. Singh and M. Hampsey, unpublished data. Consistent with this model, gene loops are transcription-dependent, requiring components of the transcription initiation and 3′-end processing complexes (22.Ansari A. Hampsey M.

Accordingly, gene looping implies a second distinct pathway for preinitiation complex (PIC) formation that bypasses the rate-limiting step of de novo recruitment and assembly of RNAP II and the general transcription factors. This model is also supported by the Ssu72 RNAP II CTD phosphatase that genetically and physically interacts with the PIC and is critical for DNA looping (19.Dichtl B. Blank D. Ohnacker M.

According to this model, the Ssu72 phosphatase activity ensures production of initiation-competent, hypo-phosphorylated RNAP II. Given that gene loops are transcription-dependent dynamic structures defined by juxtaposition of promoter-terminator regions, we asked whether alternative poly(A) site selection correlates with alternative formation of gene loops. KlCYC1 is a model gene for addressing this question because the two poly(A) sites are well separated, and the genetic locus contains multiple MspI restriction sites, which facilitate high resolution mapping of physical interactions along the length of the gene by chromatin conformation capture (3C) (31.Singh B.N. Ansari A. Hampsey M. Detection of gene loops by 3C in yeast.Methods. 2009; 48: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrate the formation of two alternative gene loops that correlate with alternative poly(A) site selection and implicate the Ssu72 CTD phosphatase in this process. The K. lactis yeast strain NRRL-Y1140, which expresses the wild type KlCYC1 gene encoding cytochrome c, was used in this study. The strain ZW13 was used to study KlCYC1 DNA loops in S. cerevisiae (32.Freire-Picos M.A. González-Siso M.I. Rodríguez-Belmonte E. Rodríguez-Torres A.M. Ramil E. Cerdán M.E. Codon usage in Kluyveromyces lactis and in yeast cytochrome c-encoding genes.Gene. 1994; 139: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae isogenic strain pair XH6 (WT) and POC8-23d (pta1-1), described previously (17.Seoane S. Lamas-Maceiras M. Rodríguez-Torres A.M.

Cells were grown in YPD medium (33.Sherman F.

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Midi RNA isolation procedure (Qiagen) using cell pellets obtained from 50-ml cultures, grown in parallel with the cultures used for 3C analysis. The F3-R2 primer pairs detected both transcripts (L and S); R3-R4 was specific for the long form. Two actin gene (ACT1) primers were used as an RNA template control. PCR products were analyzed as described for 3C. Gene loops were assayed as described previously (31.Singh B.N. Ansari A. Hampsey M. Detection of gene loops by 3C in yeast.Methods. 2009; 48: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Transient protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions were fixed by incubation of cells in 2% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Cross-links were released by incubation in 0.25 m glycine for 10 min. Cells were washed in TBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and resuspended in FA lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate). The chromatin pellet was collected by centrifugation and resuspended thoroughly in 100–120 μl of FA lysis buffer, followed by digestion overnight with the restriction enzyme MspI. The MspI digestion sites within KlCYC1 enable resolution of the promoter, ORF, two fragments of the 3′-UTR, and the two polyadenylation sites, denoted Py(A)-1 and Py(A)-2 (Fig. 1A). MspI digestion fragments were subsequently ligated in dilute solution to maximize intramolecular reaction products (31.Singh B.N. Ansari A. Hampsey M. Detection of gene loops by 3C in yeast.Methods. 2009; 48: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ligation products were assayed by PCR using tandem primers, F1 to F5, that anneal across the length of the KlCYC1 gene (Fig. 1B; Table 1). Primer pair efficiency control PCRs were performed using the KlCYC1 plasmid pCT2 as template DNA (15.Freire-Picos M.A. Lombardía-Ferreira L.J. Ramil E. González-Domínguez M. Cerdán M.E. The KlCYC1 gene, a downstream region for two differentially regulated transcripts.Yeast. 2001; 18: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). pCT2 was digested by MspI and ligated in a 10-μl volume followed by PCR amplification using the same set of primers (Fig. 1B). PCR products were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Band intensity was quantified using an AlphaImager 2200 (Alpha Innotech). Quantification was normalized by the ratio of the looping signal (SL) (for L1 or L2) to the control-loading signal obtained from the convergent primers F + R (SL/SF+R).TABLE 1DNA primers used in this studyNameSequencePositionaThe indicated positions correspond to regions depicted in Figs. 1–4.

Here, we demonstrate that they are equally effective and specific for ChIP experiments using K. lactis. The primer pairs used for PCR amplification are listed in Table 1. PCR products were fractionated and detected as described above for 3C. The data were normalized by determining the IPx/input ratio of each probed region (x) to the same IPI/input ratio of the K. lactis Klla0F intergenic region (I) located 1330 bp from KlCYC1 gene termination codon: ((IPx/inputx)/(IPI/inputI)). Data were quantified in all experiments as the mean of three independent experiments, each done in triplicate, as described (28.Rosado-Lugo J.D. Hampsey M.

Values represent the mean; error bars were calculated as standard deviation of the mean. The statistical significance of means was determined by analysis of variance using SPSS software (IBM) (Table 2).TABLE 2Analysis of variance comparing the usage of the proximal (T1) or distal (T2) processing points at two growth phases Transcription of the endogenous KlCYC1 gene of K. lactis yields two distinct transcripts that differ in the lengths of their 3′-UTRs (15.Freire-Picos M.A. Lombardía-Ferreira L.J.

The KlCYC1 gene, a downstream region for two differentially regulated transcripts.Yeast. 2001; 18: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 3′-End processing at the promoter-proximal poly(A) site produces a 1.1-kb transcript (S), whereas processing at the downstream sites yields a clearly discernable 1.5-kb transcript (L) (Fig. 1A). The poly(A) sites producing these transcripts are schematically depicted in Fig. 1B. Synthesis of the S and L forms is differentially regulated in response to cell culture growth phase, i.e. growth phase affects KlCYC1 3′-end formation. The mechanism by which the 3′-end processing machinery differentially selects the poly(A)-1 versus poly(A)-2 site to generate the S versus L forms is related to the interplay between the proximal AU-rich element and the 3′-end processing machinery (17.Seoane S. Lamas-Maceiras M. Rodríguez-Torres A.M. Freire-Picos M.A. Involvement of Pta1, Pcf11, and a KlCYC1 AU-rich element in alternative RNA 3′-end processing selection in yeast.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 2843-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analyses of the transcript isoforms under different regulatory conditions are shown in Fig. 1C. As expected, during early log phase growth (A600 = 0.6) the S form is predominant, with no detectable synthesis of the L form, and in mid-log phase growth (A600 = 1.5), synthesis of the L form is readily apparent. Note that in M phase, the F3-F2 signal (Fig. 1C, lane 5) corresponds to the two transcripts, whereas R3-R4 (lane 6) is specific to the L form. Whether poly(A) site selection is associated with the establishment of two different DNA loops is unknown. Mechanistically, this is an important issue to understand co-transcriptional RNA processing. These results guided our experimental strategy to investigate the relationship between formation of DNA loops and APA. Juxtaposition of promoter-terminator regions to form gene loops raises the question of whether alternative poly(A) site selection affects differential loop formation. To address this issue, we first assayed gene loops at the KlCYC1 locus in K. lactis. Results are presented in Fig. 2A. Cells harvested in early log phase growth (Fig. 2A, panel E) displayed the most intense 3C signal using primer pair F1 and F4, which anneals to the KlCYC1 promoter and Py(A)-1 sites to form the gene loop labeled L1 (Fig. 2A, lane 3). When paired with primer F5, which anneals to the DNA fragment encompassing poly(A)-2, F1 yielded a PCR fragment, corresponding to gene loop L2, but at only ∼"
https://openalex.org/W2291191904,"Conflict analysis has been used as an important tool in economic, business, governmental and political dispute, games, management negotiations, military operations and etc. There are many mathematical formal models have been proposed to handle conflict situations and one of the most popular is rough set theory. With the ability to handle vagueness from the conflict data set, rough set theory has been successfully used. However, computational time is still an issue when determining the certainty, coverage, and strength of conflict situations. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to handle conflict situations, based on some ideas using soft set theory. The novelty of the proposed approach is that, unlike in rough set theory that uses decision rules, it is based on the concept of co-occurrence of parameters in soft set theory. We illustrate the proposed approach by means of a tutorial example of voting analysis in conflict situations. Furthermore, we elaborate the proposed approach on real world dataset of political conflict in Indonesian Parliament. We show that, the proposed approach achieves lower computational time as compared to rough set theory of up to 3.9%."

Interestingly, putative METTL20 orthologues are found in a subset of α-proteobacteria, including Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Using an activity-based approach, we identified in bacterial extracts two substrates of recombinant METTL20 from A. tumefaciens (AtMETTL20), namely ETFβ and the ribosomal protein RpL7/L12. We show that AtMETTL20, analogous to the human enzyme, methylates ETFβ on Lys-193 and Lys-196 both in vitro and in vivo. ETF plays a key role in mediating electron transfer from various dehydrogenases, and we found that its electron transferring ability was diminished by AtMETTL20-mediated methylation of ETFβ. Somewhat surprisingly, AtMETTL20 also catalyzed monomethylation of RpL7/L12 on Lys-86, a common modification also found in many bacteria that lack METTL20. Thus, we here identify AtMETTL20 as the first enzyme catalyzing RpL7/L12 methylation.

Interestingly, putative orthologues of human METTL20 are found in some bacteria, contrasting with other human MTF16 members, which are restricted to eukaryotes. Eukaryotic ETF is a mitochondrial protein composed of two subunits, α and β (ETFα and ETFβ), and it binds two cofactors, FAD and AMP (15Toogood H.S. Leys D. Scrutton N.S. Dynamics driving function: new insights from electron transferring flavoproteins and partner complexes.FEBS J. 2007; 274: 5481-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ETF mediates transfer of electrons from several mitochondrial FAD-containing dehydrogenases (DHs) to the ETF:quinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO), leading to reduction of the quinone pool of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (15Toogood H.S. Leys D. Scrutton N.S. Dynamics driving function: new insights from electron transferring flavoproteins and partner complexes.FEBS J. 2007; 274: 5481-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In humans, there are ∼13 ETF-dependent DHs, including sarcosine dehydrogenase and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH), which are involved in choline metabolism, as well as several acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) involved in degradation of amino acids or in β-oxidation of fatty acids (e.g. medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD)) (16Steenkamp D.J.

Structural studies have shown that the so-called “recognition loop” in ETFβ, encompassing residues 191–200, is important for its interaction with MCAD, and it has been suggested that this loop is also involved in the interaction with the remaining DHs (19Toogood H.S. van Thiel A.

We and others recently showed that human METTL20 methylates ETFβ on Lys-200 and Lys-203, which partly overlap with the recognition loop, and that methylation affects electron transfer from DHs to ETF (13Małecki J.

Ho A.Y. Moen A. Dahl H.A. Falnes P.Ø. Human METTL20 is a mitochondrial lysine methyltransferase that targets the β subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETFβ) and modulates its activity.J. Biol.

Saier Jr., M.H. Phylogenetic characterization of the ubiquitous electron transfer flavoprotein families ETF-α and ETF-β.Res. Microbiol. 1995; 146: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As α-proteobacteria are considered the evolutionary precursors of mitochondria (21Esser C. Ahmadinejad N. Wiegand C. Rotte C. Sebastiani F. Gelius-Dietrich G. Henze K. Kretschmann E. Richly E. Leister D. Bryant D. Steel M.A. Lockhart P.J. Penny D. Martin W. A genome phylogeny for mitochondria among α-proteobacteria and a predominantly eubacterial ancestry of yeast nuclear genes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1643-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), this suggested that ETFβ methylation may be conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes. Protein lysine methylation appears much less common in bacteria than in eukaryotes, and many of the reported methylation events involve components of the protein synthesis machinery, e.g. ribosomal proteins and translation factors (22Polevoda B. Sherman F. Methylation of proteins involved in translation.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 590-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For example, the 50S ribosomal protein RpL11 is methylated at multiple sites by the MTase PrmA (23Demirci H. Gregory S.T. Dahlberg A.E. Jogl G.

Another example is RpL7/L12, which is part of the multimeric ribosomal stalk shown to be important for recruiting translational factors to the ribosome (24Helgstrand M. Mandava C.S. Mulder F.A.

However, the identity of the responsible enzyme(s) as well as the functional significance of the methylation remains elusive. In the present study, we have taken an unbiased approach to identify the substrates of the putative METTL20 orthologue from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (AtMETTL20). Through extensive in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that AtMETTL20 is a dual specificity KMT that targets both ETFβ and RpL7/L12. By analyzing several ETF-dependent dehydrogenases from A. tumefaciens, we show that methylation of ETFβ impairs the ability of ETF to extract electrons from these dehydrogenases. Genes encoding bacterial proteins were amplified from genomic DNA isolated from A. tumefaciens strain C58 (ATCC 33970) or Rhizobium etli strain CFN 42 (ATCC 51251) using Phusion DNA Polymerase HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA generated from HeLa cells was used to amplify ORFs for human proteins. Mutagenesis was performed using mutagenic primers designed with the PrimerX program. All constructs were sequence-verified. The NCBI Basic Local Alignment Tool (BLAST) was used to identify protein sequences homologous to A. tumefaciens METTL20, ETFβ, and RpL7/L12 (30McGinnis S. Madden T.L. BLAST: at the core of a powerful and diverse set of sequence analysis tools.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W20-W25Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Multiple protein sequence alignments were performed using algorithms embedded in the Jalview (v2.8) interface (31Waterhouse A.M. Procter J.B. Martin D.M. Clamp M. Barton G.J. Jalview Version 2—a multiple sequence alignment editor and analysis workbench.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1189-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (5689) Google Scholar). A. tumefaciens strains (C58 and GV3101 pM90) were grown at 28 °C in LB medium supplemented with 10–100 μg/ml rifampicin (Rif) and 10–50 μg/ml gentamycin (Gent). The growth rate of different strains of A. tumefaciens at 28 °C in LB or minimal medium with 0.2% glucose was followed by monitoring absorbance at 600 nm, starting from cultures with identical A600 (∼0.2). A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 pM90 (tetracycline-sensitive) was used to generate bacteria with AtMETTL20 gene knock-out (KO) using the TargeTron Gene Knock-out System (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with some modifications. In short, the pBL1 plasmid (32Yao J. Lambowitz A.M. Gene targeting in Gram-negative bacteria by use of a mobile group II intron (“Targetron”) expressed from a broad-host-range vector.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was mutated to contain an intron that would self-insert into A. tumefaciens METTL20 gene between nucleotides 261 and 262, thus introducing a premature stop codon, located downstream of the SGSG sequence within Motif I (Fig. 1A). The resulting plasmid (pBL1-MT20(261)KO) was transformed into bacteria that were selected for Rif (100 μg/ml), Gent (50 μg/ml), and tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml) resistance. Positive colonies were grown at 28 °C in MGL medium (5 g/liter tryptone, 2.5 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter mannitol, 1 g/liter monopotassium l-glutamate, 1 μg/liter biotin, 250 mg/liter KH2PO4, 100 mg/liter NaCl, 100 mg/liter MgSO4×7H2O) supplemented with Rif, Gent, and tetracycline until A600 reached 0.3, and then intron insertion was induced with 5 mm m-toluic acid for 3 h. Cells were harvested, plated, and screened for the presence of the AtMETTL20 gene with a 900-bp intron insertion. The pBL1-MT20(261)KO plasmid was removed (cured) from the bacteria by overnight growth at 28 °C in LB medium (Rif + Gent), plating on LB-agarose (Rif + Gent), and screening for tetracycline-sensitive colonies. Finally, A. tumefaciens colonies with AtMETTL20 gene knock-out were tested for absence of pBL1 plasmid (by colony PCR) and sequence-verified to contain mutated AtMETTL20 gene with properly inserted intron. Human Δ38-METTL20 (with the N-terminal 38 amino acids deleted) and human ETFα/β heterodimer were cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (13Małecki J. Ho A.Y. Moen A. Dahl H.A. Falnes P.Ø. Human METTL20 is a mitochondrial lysine methyltransferase that targets the β subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETFβ) and modulates its activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The gene encoding A. tumefaciens ETFα was cloned into pETDuet-1, whereas other relevant bacterial genes were cloned into pET28a. All proteins were expressed as N-terminally His6-tagged proteins in the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL (Agilent Technologies). Protein expression was routinely carried out at 16 °C (for 18 h) by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside except in the case of RpL7/L12 from A. tumefaciens, which as indicated was expressed at either 16 °C or 37 °C (for 4 h). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at −20 °C. Unless indicated otherwise, all proteins were purified according to the same purification protocol as described below. Bacteria were lysed in Lysis Buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mm imidazole) supplemented with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1× Complete (EDTA-free) protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 10 units/ml Benzonase nuclease (Sigma-Aldrich). His-tagged proteins were loaded onto Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated in Lysis Buffer 1, washed extensively with Lysis Buffer 1, and finally eluted with Lysis Buffer 1 supplemented with 200 mm imidazole. During purification of FAD-containing proteins, Lysis Buffer 1 was additionally supplemented with 2 μm FAD, and during purification of ETF-QO, Lysis Buffer 1 was supplemented with 2 μm FAD and 1% Triton X-100. Proteins eluted from Ni-NTA-agarose were buffer-exchanged to Storage Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) using centrifugal concentrators with a molecular mass cutoff of 10–50 kDa (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) and stored at −20 °C, except recombinant A. tumefaciens METTL20and RpL7/L12, which were stored at −20 °C in Storage Buffer containing 25% glycerol. All proteins were 90–95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining except for human METTL20, which was ∼50% pure. Protein concentration was determined using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Theoretical molecular mass of recombinant proteins was used to calculate molar concentrations. E. coli cells expressing His6-tagged ETFα and His6-tagged ETFβ were lysed separately (in Lysis Buffer 1 supplemented with 2 μm FAD) and then mixed together, and the mixed lysate was used to purify ETFα/β heterodimer on Ni-NTA-agarose similarly as described in the previous section. The eluate from Ni-NTA-agarose was buffer-exchanged to Storage Buffer using centrifugal concentrators with a molecular mass cutoff of 50 kDa and frozen at −20 °C. After thawing on ice, the precipitated protein, containing mostly free ETFβ, was removed by centrifugation, whereas the supernatant, containing mostly ETFα/β heterodimer, was again buffer-exchanged to Storage Buffer. Finally, the amount of glycerol in the sample was increased to 25%, and the protein was stored at −20 °C. For ETFα/β and other FAD-containing enzymes, the A275/A436 ratio was ∼7, indicating that FAD remained strongly associated with these proteins throughout the purification procedure. A. tumefaciens cells were lysed at 4 °C for 10 min in Lysis Buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 1× Complete (EDTA-free) protease inhibitor mixture), and the lysate was sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. Cell extracts were fractionated at 4 °C by ion exchange chromatography using either Pierce Strong Cation Exchange (S) or Pierce Strong Anion Exchange (Q) Spin Columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific). First, the NaCl concentration was reduced to 50 mm by diluting cell lysates with Dilution Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol), and then extracts were applied onto the S-column equilibrated with Dilution Buffer. Material bound to the S-column was eluted by a step gradient of increasing NaCl concentrations prepared in Dilution Buffer. Typically, four fractions were collected: 0.15S (eluted between 0.05 and 0.15 m NaCl), 0.3S (eluted between 0.15 and 0.3 m NaCl), 0.5S (eluted between 0.3 and 0.5 m NaCl), and 0.75S (eluted between 0.5 and 0.75 m NaCl). Unbound material, which was released in the S-column flow-through, was reapplied onto the Q-column equilibrated with Dilution Buffer. The unbound material, present in the Q-column flow-through, was designated FTQ, whereas material bound to the Q-column was eluted using Dilution Buffer with a step gradient of increasing NaCl concentrations, similarly as for the S-column, in four fractions, 0.15Q, 0.3Q, 0.5Q, and 0.75Q. Ribosomal particles were isolated from A. tumefaciens cells at 4 °C following a previously published procedure (27Strader M.B. Verberkmoes N.C. Tabb D.L. Connelly H.M. Barton J.W. Bruce B.D.

Cells were lysed in Ribosome Isolation Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with fresh 2 mm DTT, 1 unit/ml DNase I (Qiagen), and 1× Complete (EDTA-free) protease inhibitor mixture and sonicated. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was filtered (0.2 μm). Three milliliters of clear lysate was carefully layered on top of 1.5 ml of 1.1 m sucrose in Ribosome Isolation Buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 24 h using an Optima Max ultracentrifuge with MLS-50 rotor (Beckman-Coulter). The supernatant and the sucrose cushion were carefully removed, and the ribosomal pellet was washed, finally resuspended in Ribosome Isolation Buffer, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Typically, ribosome solutions had an A260/A280 ratio of ∼1.9. Ribosomes were quantified by RNA content, assuming a molecular extinction coefficient at 260 nm of ∈260 = 39.1 × 106 m−1 cm−1 (33Moore S.D. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T.

MTase activity of METTL20 was tested by setting up on ice 10-μl reactions containing 1× MTase Assay Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol), 3–5 μm recombinant substrate or 20–60 μg of proteins from cell extracts (and/or equivalent fractions obtained from ion exchange chromatography), 50–80 pmol of METTL20,and 0.5 μCi of [3H]AdoMet (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) ([AdoMet]total = 0.64 μm; specific activity = 78.2 Ci/mmol). Reaction mixtures were then incubated at 28 °C for 2 h. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and stained with Ponceau S. The membrane was dried, sprayed with EN3HANCE spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to Kodak BioMax MS film (Sigma-Aldrich) at −80 °C for 1–30 days. Precision Plus Protein Dual Color Standards (Bio-Rad) were used to evaluate the size of polypeptides after SDS-PAGE, and a Glow Writer autoradiography pen (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to mark the position of the standards on PVDF membrane, enabling their visualization in fluorography. When recombinant protein substrates were used, [3H]AdoMet was diluted with non-radioactive AdoMet (New England Biolabs) ([AdoMet]total = 32.6 μm; specific activity = 1.53 Ci/mmol). All fluorography experiments were performed three times with similar results, and results of representative experiments are shown. For scintillation counting and titration experiments, reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 1× MTase Assay Buffer, 0.1 mg/ml BSA (as carrier), 0.5 μCi of [3H]AdoMet ([AdoMet]total = 32.6 μm), increasing concentrations of METTL20 (0–20 μm), and fixed and equal concentrations of ETFα/β or RpL7/L12 (∼2 μm). Reactions were stopped by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was subjected to scintillation counting. In vitro methylation of recombinant or cellular (in extract) proteins for the purpose of mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed as in the above section except that [3H]AdoMet was replaced with non-radioactive AdoMet (1 mm). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue; the portion of the gel containing the protein of interest was cut out and subjected to in-gel trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich), Asp-N (Roche Applied Science), or Glu-C (Promega) digestion; and the resulting proteolytic fragments were analyzed as described previously (9Kernstock S.

We previously reported that Gtsf1 is essential for spermatogenesis and retrotransposon suppression. In this study, we investigated the expression patterns and functions of Gtsf1l and Gtsf2. Interestingly, Gtsf1l and Gtsf2 were found to be sequentially but not simultaneously expressed in gonocytes and spermatids. Pull-down experiments showed that both GTSF1L and GTSF2 can interact with PIWI-protein complexes. Nevertheless, knocking out Gtsf1, Gtsf2, or both did not cause defects in spermatogenesis or retrotransposon suppression in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2291204250,"Lantibiotics are antimicrobial peptides produced by Gram-positive bacteria. Interestingly, several clinically relevant and human pathogenic strains are inherently resistant towards lantibiotics. The expression of the genes responsible for lantibiotic resistance is regulated by a specific two-component system consisting of a histidine kinase and a response regulator. Here, we focused on a response regulator involved in lantibiotic resistance, NsrR from Streptococcus agalactiae, and determined the crystal structures of its N-terminal receiver domain and C-terminal DNA-binding effector domain. The C-terminal domain exhibits a fold that classifies NsrR as a member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of regulators. Amino acids involved in phosphorylation, dimerization, and DNA-binding were identified and demonstrated to be conserved in lantibiotic resistance regulators. Finally, a model of the full-length NsrR in the active and inactive state provides insights into protein dimerization and DNA-binding."
https://openalex.org/W2291496042,"Objectives Assessment and identification of spatial structures in the distribution and abundance of invasive species is important for unraveling the underlying ecological processes. The invasive agricultural insect pest Halyomorpha halys that causes severe economic losses in the United States is currently expanding both within United States and across Europe. We examined the drivers of H. halys invasion by characterizing the distribution and abundance patterns of H. halys and native stink bugs (Chinavia hilaris and Euschistus servus) across eight different spatial scales. We then quantified the interactive and individual influences of temperature, and measures of resource availability and distance from source populations, and their relevant spatial scales. We used Moran’s Eigenvector Maps based on Gabriel graph framework to quantify spatial relationships among the soybean fields in mid-Atlantic Unites States surveyed for stink bugs. Findings Results from the multi-spatial scale, multivariate analyses showed that temperature and its interaction with resource availability and distance from source populations structures the patterns in H. halys at very broad spatial scale. H. halys abundance decreased with increasing average June temperature and distance from source population. H. halys were not recorded at fields with average June temperature higher than 23.5°C. In parts with suitable climate, high H. halys abundance was positively associated with percentage developed open area and percentage deciduous forests at 250m scale. Broad scale patterns in native stink bugs were positively associated with increasing forest cover and, in contrast to the invasive H. halys, increasing mean July temperature. Our results identify the contrasting role of temperature in structuring regional patterns in H. halys and native stink bugs, while demonstrating its interaction with resource availability and distance from source populations for structuring H. halys patterns. Conclusion These results help predicting the pest potential of H. halys and vulnerability of agricultural systems at various regions, given the climatic conditions, and its interaction with resource availability and distance from source populations. Monitoring and control efforts within parts of the United States and Europe with more suitable climate could focus in areas of peri-urban developments with deciduous forests and other host plants, along with efforts to reduce propagule pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2292615579,"DUF1218 is a land plant-specific innovation and has previously been shown to be associated with cell wall biology, vasculature patterning and abiotic/biotic stress response. The Arabidopsis genome encodes 15 members, two of which (At1g31720 and At4g27435) are preferentially expressed in the secondary cell wall depositing inflorescence stems. To further our understanding of the roles of DUF1218-containing proteins in secondary cell wall biology, we functionally characterized At1g31720 (herein referred to as MODIFYING WALL LIGNIN-1 or MWL-1). Since related gene family members may contribute to functional redundancy, we also characterized At4g19370 (MWL-2), the most closely related gene to MWL-1 in the protein family. Subcellular localization revealed that both Arabidopsis proteins are targeted to the cell periphery. The single T-DNA knockout lines, mwl-1 and mwl-2, and independent overexpression lines showed no significant differences in plant growth or changes in total lignin content relative to wild-type (WT) control plants. However, the double homozygous mutant, mwl-1/mwl-2, had smaller rosettes with a significant decrease in rosette fresh weight and stem height relative to the WT control at four weeks and six weeks, respectively. Moreover, mwl-1/mwl-2 showed a significant reduction in total lignin content (by ca. 11% relative to WT) and an increase in syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) monomer ratio relative to the control plants. Our study has identified two additional members of the DUF1218 family in Arabidopsis as novel contributors to secondary cell wall biology, specifically lignin biosynthesis, and these proteins appear to function redundantly."
https://openalex.org/W2289255329,"Diffusion Weighted (DW) MRI allows for the non-invasive study of water diffusion inside living tissues. As such, it is useful for the investigation of human brain white matter (WM) connectivity in vivo through fiber tractography (FT) algorithms. Many DW-MRI tailored restoration techniques and FT algorithms have been developed. However, it is not clear how accurately these methods reproduce the WM bundle characteristics in real-world conditions, such as in the presence of noise, partial volume effect, and a limited spatial and angular resolution. The difficulty lies in the lack of a realistic brain phantom on the one hand, and a sufficiently accurate way of modeling the acquisition-related degradation on the other. This paper proposes a software phantom that approximates a human brain to a high degree of realism and that can incorporate complex brain-like structural features. We refer to it as a Diffusion BRAIN (D-BRAIN) phantom. Also, we propose an accurate model of a (DW) MRI acquisition protocol to allow for validation of methods in realistic conditions with data imperfections. The phantom model simulates anatomical and diffusion properties for multiple brain tissue components, and can serve as a ground-truth to evaluate FT algorithms, among others. The simulation of the acquisition process allows one to include noise, partial volume effects, and limited spatial and angular resolution in the images. In this way, the effect of image artifacts on, for instance, fiber tractography can be investigated with great detail. The proposed framework enables reliable and quantitative evaluation of DW-MR image processing and FT algorithms at the level of large-scale WM structures. The effect of noise levels and other data characteristics on cortico-cortical connectivity and tractography-based grey matter parcellation can be investigated as well."

In this study, we used a mussel-inspired immobilization strategy mediated by polymerization of dopamine to introduce recently discovered stimulators of bone forming peptide-1 (BFP-1) onto the surface of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) substrate to form a biomaterial that overcomes these challenges. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), being abundant and easy accessible, were used to test the osteogenic activity of BFP-1 and the novel biomaterial. Under osteoinductive conditions, cells treated with both BFP-1 alone and BFP-1-coated biomaterials displayed elevated expression of the osteogenic markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC), and RUNX2. Furthermore, hASCs associated with poly-dopamine-assisted BFP-1-immobilized PLGA (pDA-BFP-1-PLGA) scaffolds promoted in vivo bone formation in nude mice. Our novel materials may hold great promise for future bone tissue engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W2292615864,"Poor self-rated health (SRH) has been associated with increased risk of death and poor health outcomes even after adjusting for confounders. However its' relationship with disease-specific mortality and morbidity has been less studied. SRH may also be particularly predictive of health outcomes in those with pre-existing conditions. We studied whether SRH predicts new stroke in older people who have never had a stroke, or a recurrence in those with a prior history of stroke.MRC CFAS I is a multicentre cohort study of a population representative sample of people in their 65th year and older. A comprehensive interview at baseline included questions about presence of stroke, self-rated health and functional disability. Follow-up at 2 years included self-report of stroke and stroke death obtained from death certificates. Multiple logistical regression determined odds of stroke at 2 years adjusting for confounders including disability and health behaviours. Survival analysis was performed until June 2014 with follow-up for up to 13 years.11,957 participants were included, of whom 11,181 (93.8%) had no history of stroke and 776 (6.2%) one or more previous strokes. Fewer with no history of stroke reported poor SRH than those with stroke (5 versus 21%). In those with no history of stroke, poor self-rated health predicted stroke incidence (OR 1.5 (1.1-1.9)), but not stroke mortality (OR 1.2 (0.8-1.9)) at 2 years nor for up to 13 years (OR 1.2(0.9-1.7)). In those with a history of stroke, self-rated health did not predict stroke incidence (OR 0.9(0.6-1.4)), stroke mortality (OR 1.1(0.5-2.5)), or survival (OR 1.1(0.6-2.1)).Poor self-rated health predicts risk of stroke at 2 years but not stroke mortality among the older population without a previous history of stroke. SRH may be helpful in predicting who may be at risk of developing a stroke in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2292170398,"Cardiovascular disease (including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction) is one of the leading causes of death in Europe, and is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. With the recent advances in genomic tools and technologies there is potential to predict and diagnose heart disease using molecular data from analysis of blood cells. We analyzed gene expression data from blood samples taken from normal people (n = 21), non-significant coronary artery disease (n = 93), patients with unstable angina (n = 16), stable coronary artery disease (n = 14) and myocardial infarction (MI; n = 207). We used a feature selection approach to identify a set of gene expression variables which successfully differentiate different cardiovascular diseases. The initial features were discovered by fitting a linear model for each probe set across all arrays of normal individuals and patients with myocardial infarction. Three different feature optimisation algorithms were devised which identified two discriminating sets of genes, one using MI and normal controls (total genes = 6) and another one using MI and unstable angina patients (total genes = 7). In all our classification approaches we used a non-parametric k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classification method (k = 3). The results proved the diagnostic robustness of the final feature sets in discriminating patients with myocardial infarction from healthy controls. Interestingly it also showed efficacy in discriminating myocardial infarction patients from patients with clinical symptoms of cardiac ischemia but no myocardial necrosis or stable coronary artery disease, despite the influence of batch effects and different microarray gene chips and platforms."
https://openalex.org/W2291659148,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play a major role in various cellular functions ranging from transcription to cell migration. Mutations/modifications in such IDPs are shown to be associated with various diseases. Current strategies to study the mode of action and regulatory mechanisms of disordered proteins at the structural level are time consuming and challenging. Therefore, using simple and swift strategies for identifying functionally important regions in unstructured segments and understanding their underlying mechanisms is critical for many applications. Here we propose a simple strategy that employs dissection of human paxillin (residues 1–313) that comprises intrinsically disordered regions, followed by its interaction study using FAT (Focal adhesion targeting domain of focal adhesion kinase) as its binding partner to retrace structural behavior. Our findings show that the paxillin interaction with FAT exhibits a masking and unmasking effect by a putative intra-molecular regulatory region. This phenomenon suggests how cancer associated mutations in paxillin affect its interactions with Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK). The strategy could be used to decipher the mode of regulations and identify functionally relevant constructs for other studies."
https://openalex.org/W2291396503,"Disinhibition of the cortex (e.g., by GABA -receptor blockade) generates synchronous and oscillatory electrophysiological activity that propagates along the cortex. We have studied, in brain slices of the cingulate cortex of mice (postnatal age 14-20 days), the propagation along layer 2/3 as well as the interhemispheric propagation through the corpus callosum of synchronous discharges recorded extracellularly and evoked in the presence of 10 μM bicuculline by electrical stimulation of layer 1. The latency of the responses obtained at the same distance from the stimulus electrode was longer in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC: 39.53 ± 2.83 ms, n = 7) than in retrosplenial cortex slices (RSC: 21.99 ± 2.75 ms, n = 5; p<0.05), which is equivalent to a lower propagation velocity in the dorso-ventral direction in ACC than in RSC slices (43.0 mm/s vs 72.9 mm/s). We studied the modulation of this propagation by serotonin. Serotonin significantly increased the latency of the intracortical synchronous discharges (18.9% in the ipsilateral hemisphere and 40.2% in the contralateral hemisphere), and also increased the interhemispheric propagation time by 86.4%. These actions of serotonin were mimicked by the activation of either 5-HT1B or 5-HT2A receptors, but not by the activation of the 5-HT1A subtype. These findings provide further knowledge about the propagation of synchronic electrical activity in the cerebral cortex, including its modulation by serotonin, and suggest the presence of deep differences between the ACC and RSC in the structure of the local cortical microcircuits underlying the propagation of synchronous discharges."
https://openalex.org/W2291765642,"Decision making in risky situations is frequently required in our everyday lives and has been shown to be influenced by various factors, some of which are independent of the risk context. Based on previous findings and theories about the central role of perceptions of control and their impact on subsequent settings, spillover effects of subjective loss of control on risky decision-making are assumed. After developing an innovative experimental paradigm for inducing loss of control, its hypothesized effects on risky decision-making are investigated. Partially supporting the hypotheses, results demonstrated no increased levels of risk perceptions but decreased risk-taking behavior following experiences of loss of control. Thus, this study makes a methodological contribution by proposing a newly developed experimental paradigm facilitating further research on the effects of subjective loss of control, and additionally provides partial evidence for the spillover effects of loss of control experiences on risky decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2292189132,Detection-nondetection data are often used to investigate species range dynamics using Bayesian occupancy models which rely on the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters of the model. In this article we develop two Variational Bayes (VB) approximations to the posterior distribution of the parameters of a single-season site occupancy model which uses logistic link functions to model the probability of species occurrence at sites and of species detection probabilities. This task is accomplished through the development of iterative algorithms that do not use MCMC methods. Simulations and small practical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. We specifically show that (under certain circumstances) the variational distributions can provide accurate approximations to the true posterior distributions of the parameters of the model when the number of visits per site (K) are as low as three and that the accuracy of the approximations improves as K increases. We also show that the methodology can be used to obtain the posterior distribution of the predictive distribution of the proportion of sites occupied (PAO).
https://openalex.org/W2292609971,"Moderately convincing evidence supports the benefits of chiropractic manipulations for low back pain. Its effectiveness in other applications is less well documented, and its cost-effectiveness is not known. These questions led the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) to conduct a two-year demonstration of expanded Medicare coverage for chiropractic services in the treatment of beneficiaries with neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) conditions affecting the back, limbs, neck, or head.The demonstration was conducted in 2005-2007 in selected counties of Illinois, Iowa, and Virginia and the entire states of Maine and New Mexico. Medicare claims were compiled for the preceding year and two demonstration years for the demonstration areas and matched comparison areas. The impact of the demonstration was analyzed through multivariate regression analysis with a difference-in-difference framework.Expanded coverage increased Medicare expenditures by $50 million or 28.5% in users of chiropractic services and by $114 million or 10.4% in all patients treated for NMS conditions in demonstration areas during the two-year period. Results varied widely among demonstration areas ranging from increased costs per user of $485 in Northern Illinois and Chicago counties to decreases in costs per user of $59 in New Mexico and $178 in Scott County, Iowa.The demonstration did not assess possible decreases in costs to other insurers, out-of-pocket payments by patients, the need for and costs of pain medications, or longer term clinical benefits such as avoidance of orthopedic surgical procedures beyond the two-year period of the demonstration. It is possible that other payers or beneficiaries saved money during the demonstration while costs to Medicare were increased."
