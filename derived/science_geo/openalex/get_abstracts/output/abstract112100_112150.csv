https://openalex.org/W1972108403,"The γ subunit of immunoglobulin Fc receptors is an essential component of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI) and the low-affinity receptor for IgG (FcγRIII) and is associated with the high-affinity receptor for IgG (FcγRI) and the T cell receptor-CD3 complex. It is required for both receptor assembly and signal transduction. Targeted disruption of this subunit results in immunocompromised mice. Activated macrophages from γ chain-deficient mice unexpectedly lack the ability to phagocytose antibody-coated particles, despite normal binding. Defects in NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and mast cell-mediated allergic responses are evident in these animals, establishing the indispensable role of FcRs in these responses. However, loss of γ chain does not appear to perturb T cell development, since both thymic and peripheral T cell populations appear normal. These mice thus represent an important tool for evaluating the role of these receptors in humoral and cellular immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2070792578,"One monomeric and three oligomeric potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) cDNA units were introduced into the tobacco genome via the Agrobacterium-mediated leaf-disc transformation. Southern analysis of the integrates revealed that only their PSTVd-specific sequences become fully methylated, whereas the flanking T-DNA and the genomic plant DNA remain unaltered. Viroid cDNA methylation could only be observed after autonomous viroid RNA-RNA replication had taken place in these plants. These findings demonstrate that a mechanism of de novo methylation of genes might exist that can be induced and targeted in a sequence-specific manner by their own mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2028480293,"The four cells of an external sense organ in the Drosophila peripheral nervous system, the neuron, its sheath cell, and two ""outer support cells"" that form the hair and socket, are derived from a common precursor, the sensory organ precursor (SOP), after two rounds of division. We determined by immunocytochemistry that numb is a membrane-associated protein which localizes asymmetrically to one-half of the predivisional SOP cell. Upon division, numb segregates differentially to one daughter. Loss of numb function causes the descendants of the SOP to differentiate inappropriately, producing four outer support cells and no neuron or sheath. Ectopic expression of numb during the time of SOP division results in a transformation that is opposite to the null mutant transformation. Thus, numb functions to determine the fates of the secondary precursors; the differential distribution of numb as the SOP divides generates an asymmetric division in which the daughter cells acquire distinct identities."
https://openalex.org/W2082514530,"Trichomes are specialized epidermal cells that are regularly distributed on the leaves of Arabidopsis plants. During leaf development, each trichome undergoes cell morphogenesis, resulting in a very precise architecture. We have isolated and characterized more than 70 trichome mutants that represent 21 different genes. By analyzing their cellular phenotypes, it has been possible to define specific steps in trichome development. Although these steps normally occur in a temporal sequence, genetic dissection indicates that the morphology of the mature cell is largely assembled in independent events. The results suggest a model of how a specialized cell type originates from a uniform cell layer."
https://openalex.org/W1559780175,"Twelve peroxovanadium (pV) compounds, each containing an oxo ligand, one or two peroxo anions, and an ancillary ligand in the inner coordination sphere of V, were synthesized, crystallized, and characterized by 51V NMR as > 95% pure. These compounds activated the insulin receptor kinase (IRK) of cultured hepatoma cells, stimulated lipogenesis in adipocytes, and inhibited the in situ dephosphorylation of autophosphorylated IRs and epidermal growth factor receptors of rat liver endosomes. The phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitory and IRK activating potencies of these compounds were linearly correlated (r = 0.74; p or = 50% occupancy of IRs in vivo. Two compounds (mpV(pic) and mpV(2,6-pdc)) displayed relative specificity as phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors by inhibiting IR dephosphorylation to a significantly greater degree than epidermal growth factor receptor dephosphorylation. Thus, pV compounds are the most potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors described to date. Their capacity to activate IRK appears to derive from their phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitory activity. Their hypoglycemic action is due to a direct tissue effect."
https://openalex.org/W1989670552,"Sensory pathways of the brain generally develop from crudely wired networks to precisely organized systems. Several studies have implicated neural activity-dependent mechanisms, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, in this refinement process. We applied the gene targeting to the NMDAR1 gene and created a mutant mouse that lacks functional NMDA receptors. The development of whisker-related patterns in the trigeminal nuclei of the mutant mice and their normal littermates was compared. We show that in the mutant mice pathfinding, initial targeting, and crude topographic projection of trigeminal axons in the brainstem are unaffected, but that whisker-specific patches fail to form. Our results provide a direct demonstration of the involvement of the NMDA receptor in the formation of periphery-related neural patterns in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W2089457735,"Molecular chaperones of the Hsp70 type transiently sequester unfolded segments of proteins and promote their correct folding. Target peptides were labeled with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore so that their binding to the molecular chaperone DnaK of Escherichia coli could be followed in real time. The two-step process was characterized by relaxation times of 27 seconds and 200 seconds with 2 μM DnaK and 0.1 μM ligand at 25°C. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate, the formation of the complex was greatly accelerated and appeared to be a single-exponential process with a relaxation time of 0.4 second. The binding-release cycle of DnaK thus occurs in the time range of polypeptide chain elongation and folding and is too fast to be stoichiometrically coupled to the adenosine triphosphatase activity of the chaperone (turnover number, 0.13 per minute at 30°C)."
https://openalex.org/W1520299947,"We have used a transient transfection system with a cytomegalovirus-based vector expressing high levels of biologically active human estrogen receptor (ER) in COS-1 cells to study the phosphorylation of human ER and to identify major hormone-regulated phosphorylation sites. The features of phosphorylation of the wild-type ER were very similar to those previously observed for the endogenous ER in uterine cells: The ER exhibited a basal level of phosphorylation which was increased approximately 3-4-fold by estrogen (estradiol) and by antiestrogens (hydroxytamoxifen and ICI164,384), and phosphorylation was increased to an almost similar extent by activation of either protein kinase A or C signal transduction pathways with cholera toxin plus isobutyl methylxanthine (CT+IBMX) or phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), respectively. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the phosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine residues in all cases. Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis of ER, using a two-dimensional peptide mapping procedure, revealed similar patterns for ER in cells treated with estradiol, antiestrogens or TPA; with CT+IBMX treatment, the same phosphopeptides were seen, but the relative phosphorylation of the different ER phosphotryptic peptides differed. In ER deleted of the NH2-terminal A and B (A/B) domains, estrogen and antiestrogen-stimulated phosphorylations were abolished, while the phosphorylation induced by CT+IBMX was maintained. This suggests that sites of phosphorylation enhanced by estradiol and antiestrogen, but not those induced by CT+IBMX, are located in the A/B domain. These results were further confirmed by comparing the tryptic phosphopeptide patterns of wild-type and A/B-deleted receptor upon estradiol and CT+IBMX treatments, and then by site-directed mutagenesis, by substituting alanines for the serine residues in the A/B domain (Ser104, Ser106, Ser118, Ser154, and Ser167) involved in known protein kinase consensus sequences. Comparison of the tryptic phosphopeptide patterns of wild-type ER and these mutant ERs allowed us to identify serine 104 and/or serine 106 and serine 118, all three being part of a serine-proline motif, the preferred substrate of proline-directed protein kinase, as major ER phosphorylation sites. When tested with two estrogen-responsive reporter gene constructs in several cell types, the mutant S104A, S106A, S118A showed a approximately 40% reduction in transactivation activity in response to E2, while the mutants S118A and S104A, S106A alone showed a approximately 15% decrease in transactivation. Our studies identify several serines in the NH2-terminal portion of the human ER as being major hormone-regulated phosphorylation sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The csp gene of Drosophila encodes proteins homologous to synaptic vesicle proteins in Torpedo. Monoclonal antibodies demonstrate different distributions of isoforms at distinct subsets of terminals. Deletion of the csp gene in Drosophila causes a temperature-sensitive block of synaptic transmission, followed by paralysis and premature death."
https://openalex.org/W1505511924,"Cyclosporin A (CyA) and L-carnitine (LC) prevented the killing of cultured hepatocytes by anoxia and rotenone but not by cyanide. Neither CyA nor LC affected the rate or extent of the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential or the rate or extent of the depletion of ATP. Atractyloside blocked the ability of both CyA and LC to protect, and D-carnitine antagonized the effect of LC but not that of CyA. Cell killing by cyanide was prevented when the phospholipase A2 inhibitor butacaine was added together with CyA. Butacaine by itself had no effect on cell killing. In a swelling assay with isolated rat liver mitochondria having a low calcium content, phenylarsine oxide or palmitoyl-CoA induced the inner membrane permeability transition when electron transport was inhibited by rotenone or cyanide. CyA prevented the permeability transition with rotenone but not with cyanide, and atractyloside reversed the effect of CyA. LC prevented the permeability transition occurring with palmitoyl-CoA plus rotenone but not with palmitoyl-CoA plus cyanide. Atractyloside and D-carnitine antagonized the protective effect of LC. Inhibition of the cyanide-dependent permeability transition in isolated liver mitochondria required the presence of both CyA and butacaine. These data document the close correlation between the effect of CyA and LC on the response of cultured hepatocytes to inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport and their ability to prevent the permeability transition in isolated mitochondria. It is concluded that the ability of CyA and LC to protect cultured hepatocytes is a consequence of their ability to prevent the mitochondrial permeability transition, indicating that this event is likely to be causally linked to the genesis of irreversible injury. Thus, cell death with anoxia or inhibitors of electron transport is related to a mitochondrial alteration by a mechanism that is independent of the maintenance of a membrane potential or cellular stores of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1972467203,"Within hours of Listeria monocytogenes infection, host cell actin filaments form a dense cloud around the intracytoplasmic bacteria and then rearrange to form a polarized comet tail that is associated with moving bacteria. We have devised a cell-free extract system capable of faithfully reconstituting L. monocytogenes motility, and we have used this system to demonstrate that profilin, a host actin monomer-binding protein, is necessary for bacterial actin-based motility. We find that extracts from which profilin has been depleted do not support comet tail formation or bacterial motility. In extracts and host cells, profilin is localized to the back half of the surface of motile L. monocytogenes, the site of actin filament assembly in the tail. This association is not observed with L. monocytogenes mutants that do not express the ActA protein, a bacterial gene product necessary for motility and virulence. Profilin also fails to bind L. monocytogenes grown outside of host cytoplasm, suggesting that at least one other host cell factor is required for this association."
https://openalex.org/W1514367558,"Mac-2, a 30-35-kDa galactose-binding protein, is synthesized at similar levels in murine peritoneal exudate macrophages whether recruited in response to an intraperitoneal pathogen Mycobacterium microti, to sterile inflammatory stimuli such as thioglycollate broth, or to concanavalin A. In elicited or activated macrophages up to 30% of Mac-2 is constitutively secreted, and secretion is stimulated markedly by calcium ionophore A23187. Only thioglycollate-elicited macrophages express cell surface Mac-2, and binding is mostly (> 80%) a result of affinity for cell surface carbohydrate structures. Mac-2 surface expression is markedly reduced upon further activation of thioglycollate-elicited macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide in vitro. Polylactosamine structures are present on all macrophage populations examined as determined by binding of Lycopersicon esculentum lectin, whereas alpha-galactosyl residues detected by Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 are expressed only on the thioglycollate-elicited macrophages, indicating that these residues are the major determinants responsible for Mac-2 surface expression. Chemical cross-linking experiments have identified binding of endogenous cell-surface Mac-2 to three glycoproteins of molecular masses of 92, 125, and 180 kDa containing alpha-galactosyl and polylactosamine structures on thioglycollate-elicited macrophages. The restricted cell surface distribution of Mac-2 on thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, a population of recently recruited monocytes, suggests a role(s) in early events of macrophage infiltration and tissue fixation such as extravasion and cell-matrix interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2017485209,"The patterning of cell types in embryogenesis is specified by signals emanating from specialized organizer regions. We demonstrate that engrailed-expressing cells in the Drosophila epidermis have organizer properties. These cells influence the pattern of cell type differentiation across the segment. We show that this function is mediated by the hedgehog (hh) gene. The results of modulating the levels of hh in the embryo suggest that hh acts as a morphogen, specifying distinct cell fates by a concentration-dependent mechanism. We present a model that integrates the role of hh with that of the wingless signal in establishing the segmental array of cell type diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2152890178,"The actions and receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) are largely restricted to cells of the nervous system, although one of the CNTF receptor components, CNTFR alpha, is expressed by skeletal muscle. Here we show that the other CNTF receptor components, LIFR beta and gp130, are also expressed by skeletal muscle and that expression of all three CNTF receptor components is greatly increased in denervated muscle. In vivo, administration of CNTF activates these receptors on skeletal muscle by inducing receptor phosphorylation and immediate-early gene responses. Furthermore, CNTF reduces the denervation-induced atrophy of muscle and attenuates the reduced twitch and tetanic tensions that result from muscle denervation. Our findings reveal that, in addition to its known neurotrophic actions, CNTF exerts myotrophic effects by attenuating the morphological and functional changes associated with denervation of rat skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2013510734,"The average age of humans at their first infection with Plasmodium falciparum is typically less than 1 year in most endemic areas. This has been interpreted as evidence of the high transmissibility of the parasite, with the implication that control of malaria will require high levels of coverage with a potential vaccine. This interpretation is challenged by mathematical models that demonstrate that the long period required to develop immunity to malaria permits a high risk (or low average age) of infection even when parasite transmissibility is low. Patterns of seroconversion to five antigenically distinct isolates of P. falciparum in a highly malarious area of Papua New Guinea indicate that each is only mildly transmissible and that malaria, as a construct of several such independently transmitted strains, has a basic reproductive rate (or transmissibility) that is an order of magnitude lower than other estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2006773867,"Obstruction of airways by viscous sputum causes lung damage in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Sputum samples from CF patients were shown to contain filamentous actin. Human plasma gelsolin, a protein that severs actin filaments, rapidly decreased the viscosity of CF sputum samples in vitro. Gc globulin and deoxyribonuclease I, proteins that sequester monomeric actin but do not sever actin filaments, were less efficient than gelsolin in diminishing sputum viscosity. These results suggest that gelsolin may have therapeutic potential as a mucolytic agent in CF patients."
https://openalex.org/W2122485770,A change in radical pair recombination rates is one of the few mechanisms by which a magnetic field can interact with a biological system. The kinetic parameter Vmax/Km (where Km is the Michaelis constant) for the coenzyme B12-dependent enzyme ethanolamine ammonia lyase was decreased 25 percent by a static magnetic field near 0.1 tesla (1000 gauss) with unlabeled ethanolamine and decreased 60 percent near 0.15 tesla with perdeuterated ethanolamine. This effect is likely caused by a magnetic field-induced change in intersystem crossing rates between the singlet and triplet spin states in the [cob(II)alamin:5'-deoxyadenosyl radical] spin-correlated radical pair.
https://openalex.org/W1498543655,"Heat-shock proteins (hsps) function in a variety of ways to help cells and organisms cope with environmental changes. One class of hsps, the Hsp100 proteins, is especially important for tolerance to a variety of extremely stressful conditions (e.g. high temperatures or high concentrations of ethanol). To begin to characterize the mechanism of action of Hsp100 proteins, we have initiated an in vitro analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp104 protein. Here, we report the purification and initial structural characterization of the wild-type protein and three variants carrying mutations in the two ATP-binding site consensus elements. As demonstrated by both gel filtration chromatography and by cross-linking studies with glutaraldehyde, Hsp104 forms a homohexameric particle. By electron microscopy, these particles are ring-shaped and reminiscent of proteins in the Hsp60 and TF55/TCP families. In contrast to these other proteins, Hsp104 forms single rings, each containing only six subunits. More strikingly, the assembly and maintenance of Hsp104 particles are dependent upon the presence of adenine nucleotides. Oligomerization appears to primarily depend upon the second of the two ATP-binding sites in the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1558934363,"Primase plays a key role in governing the sequence of events required on the lagging strand during a cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis. To begin to probe the protein-protein interactions necessary for primase function at the replication fork, we have used limited trypsinolysis to separate primase into two functional domains, an N-terminal domain of 49 kDa (p49) and a carboxyl-terminal domain of 16 kDa (p16). p49 retained primase activity in replication assays that utilized bacteriophage M13 DNA carrying the bacteriophage G4 origin of DNA replication as the template, but was inactive during general priming or the conversion of phi X174 single-stranded circular (ss(c))-DNA to the replicative form (RF) and could not support lagging-strand DNA synthesis at replication forks reconstituted with the phi X-type primosomal proteins and the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. On the other hand, p16 inhibited those replication reactions that included the replication fork helicase, DnaB (general priming, phi X174 ss(c)-->RF, and at the replication fork), but had no effect on those that did not (M13Gori ss(c)-->RF). These results demonstrate that p49 defines a domain of primase required for catalytic activity, that p16 defines a domain of primase required for functional interaction with DnaB, and that it is a protein-protein interaction with DnaB that attracts primase to the replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W1992274725,"Calmodulin, a cytoplasmic calcium-binding protein, is indispensable for eukaryotic cell growth. Examination of 14 temperature-sensitive yeast mutants bearing one or more phenylalanine to alanine substitutions in the single essential calmodulin gene of yeast (CMD1) revealed diverse essential functions. Mutations could be classified into four intragenic complementation groups. Each group showed different characteristic functional defects in actin organization, calmodulin localization, nuclear division, or bud emergence. Phenylalanine residues implicated in calmodulin localization and nuclear division are located in the amino-terminal half of the protein, whereas those implicated in actin organization and bud emergence are located in the carboxyl-terminal half."
https://openalex.org/W1518341722,"Rex protein, the post-transcriptional regulator of human T-cell leukemia virus type I, is located predominantly in the cell nucleolus and is associated with the cytoplasmic accumulation of unspliced and singly spliced viral mRNAs. The N-terminal 19-amino acid segment of Rex has been identified as the nucleolar targeting signal (NOS) and shown to be important for Rex function. To study the molecular interaction between the NOS region of Rex and its binding host protein(s) in the nucleolus, we chemically synthesized a functional NOS peptide (wild type) and mutant NOS peptides. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated functional NOS peptide was rapidly taken up by human cells and was transported to the nucleolus. Using affinity chromatography, we identified nucleolar protein B-23 as the major protein that binds to NOS. We also identified two highly acidic regions of B-23 (amino acids 120-132 and 161-188) as acceptor regions for NOS. Previous experiments have suggested that B-23 functions as a shuttle protein for the nucleolar transport of ribosomal components. Our results suggest that B-23 may also serve as a shuttle for the import of Rex from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus coupled to the export of viral mRNAs containing the Rex-responsive element."
https://openalex.org/W1515034438,"Apolipophorin-III (apoLp-III), a hemolymph protein of Manduca sexta, can reversibly associate with the surface of lipoprotein particles. In order to examine the lipid-associated form of apoLp-III, the present studies investigate the structure and properties of apoLp-III complexes with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC). Association of apoLp-III with DMPC vesicles results in the formation of uniform discs with an average diameter and width of 18.5 +/- 2.0 nm and 4.8 +/- 0.8 nm, respectively, as determined by electron microscopy. ApoLp-III.DMPC complexes analyzed by pore-limiting native gradient PAGE demonstrated that a single major species of complex was formed within a wide range of lipid to protein molar ratios (DMPC:apoLp-III; 13:1 to 360:1). Flotation equilibrium experiments, conducted in an analytical ultracentrifuge, confirmed that only one species of apoLp-III.DMPC complex was formed at an initial lipid to protein molar ratio of 67:1, with an apparent molecular mass of 642,000. Complexes cross-linked with dimethyl suberimidate indicate that there are a maximum of 6 apoLp-III molecules per disc. Circular dichroism experiments revealed that apoLp-III becomes essentially completely alpha-helical on formation of apoLp-III.DMPC complexes. Compared to apoLp-III in the lipid-free state, apoLp-III.DMPC complexes were relatively resistant to denaturation by guanidine HCl, displaying denaturation transitions with midpoints at 2.2 and 3.7 M guanidine HCl, respectively. The fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of apoLp-III.DMPC complexes demonstrate a large enhancement of tyrosine fluorescence as compared to the lipid-free state, suggesting that a conformational change occurs when apoLp-III associates with a lipid surface. Denaturation of apoLp-III in the complex by guanidine HCl resulted in a tyrosine fluorescence level similar to that of lipid-free apoLp-III in the presence of guanidine HCl. The tyrosine-induced fluorescence of the complex was quenched with both Cs+ (Kq = 0.573 M-1) and KI (Kq = 0.376 M-1). The results presented in this study indicate that the conformation of apoLp-III is stabilized when complexed with phospholipids and suggest that tyrosine fluorescence provides a sensitive method to detect M. sexta apoLp-III interaction with lipid surfaces.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1482377527,"Profilin is a ubiquitous protein that has been implicated in the signaling pathway leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement in cells. An unusual property of profilin is its high binding affinity for poly-L-proline (PLP). This binding property is conserved in the profilins from diverse species with little sequence homology. We have monitored the binding of PLP to profilin by fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. NMR spectroscopy has identified several residues whose amide nitrogen and amide hydrogen chemical shifts are significantly perturbed by binding of PLP. The affected residues are located at various locations throughout profilin's primary structure; however, mapping the location of the affected residues onto the recently determined three-dimensional solution structure of human profilin indicates that the effects of PLP binding are highly localized. Poly-L-proline binds profilin at the hydrophobic interface between profilin's NH2- and COOH-terminal helices and the upper face of its antiparallel beta-sheet. In contrast, residues located on the opposite side of the profilin structure are unaffected. The extent of the potential interaction surface of the PLP-profilin complex suggests that as few as 6 contiguous prolines would be sufficient for binding profilin. Examination of sequence data bases indicates that stretches of prolines of this length and longer occur in numerous regulatory proteins, suggesting that the ability of profilin to bind polyproline may be an important component of its signaling capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W1511819831,"Recent studies suggest that epithelial cells and neurons employ similar mechanisms to target proteins to the distinct subdomains of their polarized cell surface membranes. We have examined the sorting behavior of the neuronal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter GAT-1 expressed by transfection in the polarized epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line. We find that the GABA transporters endogenously expressed by polarized hippocampal neurons in culture are restricted to axonal plasma membranes. In transfected MDCK cells, the GABA transporter is found to be localized primarily to the apical cell surface when examined by immunocytochemistry, cell surface biotinylation, and transport assay. MDCK cells exposed to hyperosmotic stress express a close relative of GAT-1, the betaine transporter (BGT-1). We find that BGT-1 expressed by transfection in MDCK cells accumulates predominantly at the basolateral cell surface. These observations suggest that the sorting information required for axonal targeting may be similar to that which mediates apical localization in epithelia. Furthermore, it would appear that despite their high degree of homology, the BGT-1 and GAT-1 transporters manifest sorting signals which specify their targeting to distinct cell surface domains."
https://openalex.org/W1492963020,"The source of the cholesterol used for ester synthesis by cultured rat hepatoma cells was examined. The activities synthesizing and esterifying cholesterol co-distributed with RNA at a high buoyant density, presumably in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Cholesterol mass was undetectable in the RER, and the transfer of cholesterol synthesized in the RER to the cell surface was more than 100 times greater than was its esterification. Similarly, essentially all of the cholesterol liberated from ingested intracellular lipoproteins was recovered at the cell surface. The plasma membranes, which contained approximately 87% of cell cholesterol, provided > 100 times more cholesterol for esterification in the RER than did nascent cholesterol. The supply of cholesterol was rate-limiting for esterification in cell homogenates. Prior oxidation of plasma membrane cholesterol in intact cells reduced the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity in isolates proportionately. Finally, cholesterol in hepatoma plasma membranes was a far better substrate for in vitro esterification than was that in fibroblast plasma membranes, red blood cell ghosts, or liposomes. We conclude that the level of saturation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, controlled principally through the bidirectional movement of the substrate between plasma membranes and RER, plays a major role in the regulation of cholesterol esterification."
https://openalex.org/W2147525115,"In ram spermatozoa treatment with Ca2+ and A23187 or ionomycin stimulated the release of arachidonic acid (20:4) and exocytosis of the acrosome in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Diacylglycerol did not appear to be the source of 20:4. On the other hand, generation of 20:4 was significantly correlated with breakdown of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine under a variety of conditions, thus indicating that 20:4 release was due to phospholipase A2 activity. Generation of 20:4 preceded acrosomal exocytosis. Moreover, it was significantly correlated with exocytosis when spermatozoa were stimulated with Ca2+ and A23187 or ionomycin for different periods of time or with different ionophore concentrations. Treatment with Ro 31-4493, a compound that has been found to inhibit sperm phospholipase A2 activity in vitro, considerably reduced both the release of 20:4 and exocytosis; addition of exogenous 20:4 or lysophosphatidylcholine overcame the inhibitory effect of Ro 31-4493. Spermatozoa preincubated with several unsaturated fatty acids, including 20:4, underwent exocytosis much more rapidly when treated with Ca2+/A23187. Exogenous lysophosphatidylcholine also enhanced acrosomal exocytosis and this effect was mimicked by an alkyl-containing analogue (1-O-alkyl-glycerophosphorylcholine = lyso-platelet activating factor). These results indicate that phospholipase A2 plays a fundamental role in the exocytosis of the acrosome elicited by Ca2+ and ionophore stimulation. Therefore, it is possible that activation of this enzyme constitutes an essential Ca2+-dependent event underlying exocytosis in response to physiological stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1544184681,"Plastocyanin and the 16-, 23-, and 33-kDa polypeptides of the oxygen-evolving complex associated with photosystem II are hydrophilic, nuclear encoded components of the photosynthetic machinery that are all located in the lumen of thylakoid membranes. All four proteins are therefore imported into chloroplasts and, in addition, translocated across the thylakoid membrane. They share functionally equivalent, bipartite transit peptides, which are removed in two steps during or after import into the organelle and translocation across the thylakoid membrane, respectively. The transit peptides lack any homology at the sequence level but possess remarkably similar predicted secondary structures. We have studied the targeting potential of the authentic precursor molecules and all possible chimeric combinations generated by a specific, commonly applicable cassette system, which facilitates codon-correct reciprocal exchanges of transit peptides and mature parts. An unexpected specificity of import and sorting processes was found. All constructs can be imported into the organelle, though with greatly differing efficiency. On the other hand, the lumen-targeting parts are essential but not in all cases sufficient for correct intraorganellar routing. This implies that translocation across the thylakoid membrane appears not to depend merely on simple interactions of charged or hydrophobic regions between protein and membrane but requires an additional quality of information that includes the functional co-evolution of a transit peptide with its mature protein. Signaling and sorting appear to be essential at almost every step of the entire process for proper traffic regulation since distinct steps can be impaired (rate-limiting or arrested) in the individual combinations: the transfer across the envelope membranes (e.g. 16/PC) and the interaction with (e.g. 16/33) or the translocation across the thylakoid membrane (e.g. 33/23)."

The technique is based on laser optogalvanic effect spectroscopy, in which an electrical (galvanic) signal is detected in response to the optical stimulation of a resonance transition in a gas discharge species. Carbon dioxide molecular gas lasers are used, with the probed transitions being identical to the lasing transitions. Measurements for carbon dioxide samples with 100-second averaging times yield isotopic ratios with a precision of better than 10 parts per million."
https://openalex.org/W1504101711,"Activation of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) by terminal complement complexes (TCC) was investigated on human lymphoblastoid B-cell line JY25 and its mutant JY5 deficient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. TCC assembly achieved by antibody-dependent activation of C7-deficient serum reconstituted with C7 increased specific guanosine-5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding, 4- and 8-fold, in JY25 and JY5 membranes, respectively, between 2 and 10 min, over the level without C7. TCC also increased GTPase activity 5- and 4-fold in JY25 and JY5, respectively, between 5 and 10 min. Increased GTPase activity was noted first with C5b-7 assembly, which increased further with C5b-8 and C5b-9. The presence of G proteins in anti-TCC immunoprecipitates of cell lysates was investigated by demonstration of G alpha subunit that can be ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin (PTX). Immunoprecipitated TCC complexes contained a PTX-sensitive 41-kDa Gi alpha/Go alpha subunit, as shown by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. These complexes were functionally active as determined by GTP gamma S binding. We have further shown that enhanced TCC elimination from the plasma membrane induced by TCC-generated signals was inhibited by PTX. In conclusion the biological activities induced by TCC in nucleated cells may be mediated in part by activation of PTX-sensitive G proteins."

In the present study, the O-linked oligosaccharides and the occurrence of a differentiation antigen were analyzed in CHO cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding human leukosialin alone (CHO-leu) or with cDNAs encoding both leukosialin and C2GnT (CHO-leu.C2GnT). The analysis of O-glycans, released from [3H]glucosamine-labeled cells, revealed that CHO-leu cells synthesize O-glycans with a Gal beta 1-->3GalNAc backbone, whereas CHO-leu.C2GnT cells synthesize in addition O-glycans with a Gal beta 1-->3(Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc beta 1-->6)GalNAc backbone. Moreover, CHO-leu.C2GnT cells express poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl extensions from the GlcNAc beta 1-->6 branch in O-glycans, while CHO-leu cells express no detectable amount of poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl O-glycans. It was also demonstrated that leukosialin in CHO-leu.C2GnT cells is recognized by the T305 monoclonal antibody, while the same antibody did not react at all with CHO-leu cells. In addition, the transient expression cloning scheme using the T305 monoclonal antibody as a selectin marker and COS-1 cells, which endogenously express C2GnT as recipient cells, resulted in the isolation of cDNA encoding leukosialin. These results indicate that C2GnT determines the expression of poly-N-acetyllactosamines in O-glycans and together with leukosialin, an onco-differentiation antigen recognized by the T305 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1547899621,"This study analyzed the complex interactions of intact spectrin with bovine brain membranes by evaluating membrane associations of defined regions of beta G spectrin, the subunit responsible for high affinity membrane binding. Two regions of beta G spectrin were expressed in bacteria and demonstrated to contain fully functional binding site(s) for a subset of spectrin-binding sites in brain membranes depleted of peripheral proteins. One region, located near the NH2 terminus, was comprised of 106-residue repeats and required repeats 2-7 for full activity. The other binding domain was located at the COOH terminus, which is the most variable between beta G and beta R spectrins, is distinct from the 106-residue repeats, and contains a pleckstrin homology domain. NH2-terminal beta spectrin polypeptides interacted with a membrane site(s) that recognized both brain and erythrocyte isoforms of spectrin, was inhibited by calcium/calmodulin, and was not blocked by the COOH-terminal polypeptide. The COOH-terminal region associated with a membrane site(s) that was specific for brain spectrin, was not inhibited by calcium/calmodulin, and was not blocked by the NH2-terminal polypeptide. These observations demonstrate membrane association of spectrin with at least two independent sites, which differ with regard to regulation by calcium/calmodulin and in selectivity for spectrin isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1606999002,"We have recently identified a complex transcriptional regulatory element in the medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) gene promoter region that confers response to retinoids through interaction with receptors for all-trans-retinoic acid (RARs) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (RXRs) (Raisher, B. D., Gulick, T., Zhang, Z., Strauss, A. W., Moore, D. D., and Kelly, D. P. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20264-20269). We examined the interaction of this element (RAREMCAD) with hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), an orphan receptor with a tissue expression pattern similar to that of MCAD. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and cotransfection experiments showed that HNF-4 binds with high affinity to RAREMCAD to activate transcription by an RXR-independent mechanism. Mutational analysis revealed that the MCAD HNF-4 response element consists of an imperfect direct repeat homologous to the consensus sequence for binding to the thyroid receptor/RAR/RXR subgroup of receptors and that distinct sequence requirements dictate HNF-4 binding and transactivation. Mobility shift assays with anti-HNF-4 antiserum demonstrated that the MCAD HNF-4 response element binds endogenous rat liver HNF-4 supporting its role in the regulation of MCAD gene expression in vivo. Thus, HNF-4 activates MCAD gene transcription via a complex regulatory element, the architecture of which carries important implications for the structure of HNF-4 response elements in general."
https://openalex.org/W1511928903,"Rat pituitary GH4C1 cells express protein kinase C (PKC) transcripts for cPKC alpha, cPKC beta II, nPKC delta, nPKC epsilon, nPKC eta, and aPKC zeta, but not for cPKC gamma or nPKC theta. Of the transcripts produced, the nPKC epsilon isoform is the most abundant. Transfection of GH4C1 cells with an expression plasmid containing nPKC epsilon cDNA leads to the transient overexpression of cellular nPKC epsilon and confers enhanced phorbol ester binding activity. Transient expression of an inactive point mutant (nPKC epsilon K-->R) of nPKC epsilon, where Lys436 at the putative ATP-binding site is replaced with Arg, also confers elevated binding activity. However, only overproduction of the wild type in transfected cells increases the basal levels and stimulates the secretion of prolactin (PRL) by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). In stable clones overexpressing nPKC epsilon, immunocytofluorescence and immunoblot experiments indicated that TRH causes the rapid translocation and down-regulation of an appreciable fraction of nPKC epsilon. Both the basal and TRH-stimulated levels of PRL secretion are clearly correlated with the expression level of nPKC epsilon but not with the TRH receptor densities in these clones. The dose dependence of TRH-stimulated secretion were similar in all cells overexpressing cPKC alpha, cPKC beta II, nPKC epsilon, and nPKC delta, but the enhancement of PRL secretion was specific for the overproduction of nPKC epsilon, no effect was found when other isozymes were overproduced. These findings clearly demonstrate that the expression level of nPKC epsilon in GH4C1 cells is rate-limiting for basal and TRH-stimulated PRL secretion, and they provide the first direct evidence that nPKC epsilon plays a key role in hormonal secretory processes."
https://openalex.org/W1487872002,"The membrane-bound fraction of purified Na,K-ATPase was characterized following extensive proteolytic digestion in the presence of various physiological ligands which stabilize different conformational states of the sodium pump. There are distinctive conformational changes of the protein which are revealed by amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the digests following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The changes in cleavage patterns result from alterations in domain-domain interactions of the protein. We provide evidence in the alpha-subunit for (i) tight interaction between part of the cytoplasmic ATP binding domain and the membrane-bound portion of the protein; (ii) involvement of the cytoplasmic loop between M2 and M3 in structural rearrangements upon phosphorylation or ion binding; (iii) generation of the same digested products when either ouabain or potassium (rubidium) is present. Similarly, evidence is provided for conformational sensitivity of the extracellular domain of the beta-subunit. The position of the tryptic cleavage point in the beta-subunit is altered depending on whether the alpha-subunit is phosphorylated or whether rubidium ions are occluded. Based upon the conformationally dependent patterns of exposure and protection of different tryptic cleavage sites in the alpha- and beta-subunits we propose a model for intraprotein interactions within the alpha-subunit and between alpha- and beta-subunits following the binding of physiological ligands to the Na,K-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1509867470,"The functional role of the different sites binding transcriptional factors on the tissue-specific, glucose-responsive promoter of the L type pyruvate kinase gene (L-PK) has been investigated in transgenic mice. These sites are able to bind, from 3' to 5', HNF1, NF1, HNF4, and MLTF/USF, respectively. We have compared the level of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter transgene expression when driven by a L-PK promoter fragment of either -96 base pairs (bp) (containing only the HNF1 binding site) or -150 bp (lacking the MLTF/USF binding site) or driven by a -183-bp L-PK promoter fragment with or without the NF1 binding site. Our results demonstrate that: 1) HNF1 alone is not sufficient to promote an efficient L-PK gene transcription in vivo; 2) with only binding sites for HNF1, NF1, and HNF4, though the tissue-specific pattern of expression is respected, the level of the gene transcription is low and the hormonal control is lost; 3) the MLTF/USF binding site is the target of the hormonal control, required for both positive response to carbohydrates and negative response to glucagon; 4) the role of NF1 in the promoter activity could be to negatively modulate the L-PK gene expression in the different tissues, without interfering with the glucose and hormone responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1519890846,"The alpha subunit of the GTP-binding regulatory protein Gz has been shown to be a substrate for N-myristoylation, palmitoylation, and protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation. In the present study, we used an NH2-terminal Gly-->Ala mutation to examine the relevance of myristoylation to phosphorylation and anchorage. 293 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding the normal or mutant form of alpha z. Normal alpha z was myristoylated and stably anchored, as assessed by biosynthetic labeling and sedimentation with membrane following cell lysis. The mutant form of alpha z was not myristoylated and was found predominantly (70-90%) in the cytosol. These distributions were corroborated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Thus, the NH2-terminal glycine of alpha z appears critical for both myristoylation and anchorage. The effects of the Gly-->Ala mutation, however, were not confined to these two events. Significantly, the mutation also prevented palmitoylation, which presumably occurs at Cys3 in the normal subunit. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that myristoylation alone is sufficient for anchorage. The protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of alpha z was demonstrated previously to occur near to the NH2 terminus, raising the possibility of an effect of phosphorylation on anchorage or, conversely, an effect of myristoylation and/or palmitoylation on phosphorylation. The phosphorylation induced in 293 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, however, had little impact on anchorage. Moreover, the mutant (and thus cytosolic) form of alpha z was as good a substrate for phosphorylation as the normal subunit. The fact that myristoylation occurs in cells containing alpha z normally, as well as the fact that phosphorylation does not influence anchorage, was confirmed with mouse anterior pituitary AtT-20 and rat basophilic RBL-2H3 cells. These results demonstrate: 1) that mutagenesis of the glycine needed for myristoylation of alpha z also inhibits palmitoylation, 2) that the resultant lack of myristoylation and/or palmitoylation does not support anchorage, and 3) that neither myristoylation, palmitoylation, nor anchorage is required for phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1530358119,"The basic region/helix-loop-helix dioxin receptor mediates signal transduction by dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin). Upon ligand binding the dioxin receptor is converted from a latent, non-DNA binding form to a form that directly interacts with target genes by binding to dioxin-responsive transcriptional control elements. We have purified by conventional and DNA affinity chromatographic procedures the ligand-activated, DNA binding form of dioxin receptor to examine its architecture and functional properties. We observed that the DNA binding activity of the receptor was labile. Most notably, this activity was lost following DNA affinity purification. In complementation experiments we have identified an auxiliary factor(s) that exhibited very poor, if any, intrinsic affinity for the DNA target sequence in vitro but strongly increased the DNA binding activity of the purified receptor-containing material identified by immunoblot analysis. In a similar fashion the in vitro expressed basic region/helix-loop-helix factor Arnt (that has been postulated to modulate the nuclear translocation function of the receptor) reconstituted the DNA binding function of the purified receptor, and the purified auxiliary factor reconstituted receptor activity upon addition to an extract from mutant, Arnt-deficient hepatoma cells. Conversely, purified dioxin receptor reconstituted DNA binding activity in extracts from receptor-deficient hepatoma cells which express bona fide levels of Arnt. Interestingly, UV cross-linking studies using a BrdU-substituted DNA target sequence indicated that primarily the receptor protein was bound to DNA. Moreover, we demonstrate that purified receptor or Arnt exhibited virtually no detectable affinity for the target sequence individually but, in the presence of one another, showed a strong synergy in DNA binding activity in vitro. Importantly, simultaneous expression of the receptor and Arnt resulted in synergistic induction of gene expression in vivo. These data demonstrate that Arnt plays a central role in control of dioxin receptor function by cooperatively modulating the DNA binding activity of the receptor in vitro and dioxin-dependent transactivation in vivo."

A broad body of data links this 5-base element to the selective degradation of these mRNAs. However, AUUUA motifs are neither always necessary nor always sufficient to tag an mRNA for rapid degradation. Here, we describe a cytoplasmic, protease-sensitive factor in Balb/c3T3 cells that interacts with the 3'-untranslated region of c-myc mRNA. The factor recognizes a 39-base uridine-rich domain adjacent to, but distinct from, the c-myc AUUUA motif.

https://openalex.org/W1501652397,"The estradiol-fatty acid esters are highly potent and long-lived estrogens that were first isolated and identified from in vitro biosynthetic experiments (Mellon-Nussbaum S., Ponticorvo, L., Schatz, F., and Hochberg, R. B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5678-5684). Other studies have indicated that these esters exist endogenously, but the evidence is indirect, resting solely on the presence of a nonpolar saponifiable metabolite. Although there are similar reports of other naturally occurring fatty acid esters of biologically active steroid hormones, likewise, none has been isolated and characterized. In this study we have found that follicular fluid from the ovaries of women stimulated with gonadotrophins contains relatively large amounts of a nonpolar saponifiable derivative of estradiol (approximately 10(-7)M), which we presumed to be fatty acid esters. Using a combination of chromatographic techniques we isolated these estradiol metabolites and identified them by mass spectral analysis. They are a mixture of five different estradiol-17 fatty acid esters. The amount of each present was determined by separating the esters by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and then quantifying each peak by radioimmunoassay and UV absorption. The esters of estradiol are predominantly unsaturated, with linoleate the most abundant comprising 43% of the total. The other esters are: palmitate (20%), arachidonate (19%), oleate (14%), and stearate (4%). Thus these studies conclusively demonstrate the existence of these unusually powerful estrogens."
https://openalex.org/W1584514463,"Prenylation and subsequent processing of many proteins involved in cellular signaling serves to direct and/or anchor these proteins to specific membranes in the cell. One major class of prenylated proteins contains the so-called CAAX motif; such proteins contain a cysteine residue fourth from the COOH terminus. After addition of the isoprenoid to this cysteine residue by specific cytosolic protein prenyltransferases, the proteins are subject to further processing by enzymes associated with microsomal membranes. This suggests that newly prenylated proteins are initially directed to a microsomal membrane compartment for completion of their processing. Using a radiolabeled, prenylated peptide as a ligand, we have identified a specific, high affinity binding site or receptor on microsomal membranes. This receptor is both protease- and heat-sensitive and exhibits saturable binding of the prenylated peptide with a KD of 30 nM. Competition analysis indicates that both geranylgeranylated and farnesylated, but not myristoylated, peptides bind to this receptor. A fully processed prenylated protein also does not compete, indicating a role for the three terminal residues of the prenylated peptide in receptor recognition. This receptor may serve to direct newly prenylated proteins to a microsomal compartment for completion of processing prior to trafficking to their final destination in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1515756734,"Bloodstream forms of the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, can acquire substantial amounts of exogenous lysophospholipid. Lysophosphatidylcholine uptake is through a pathway consisting of three enzymes, phospholipase A1, acyl-CoA ligase, and lysophosphatidylcholine:acyl-CoA acyltransferase. The pathway enables the organism to acquire fatty acids and phospholipid head groups such as choline. Radiolabeling and 13C NMR studies show that two molecules of lysophosphatidylcholine are used to generate one molecule of cellular phosphatidylcholine. The three enzymes are associated with the trypanosomal plasma membrane and are accessible to exogenous substrates. The first enzyme, phospholipase A1, generates free fatty acid from exogenous lysophospholipid, which the second enzyme, a ligase, uses to form acyl-CoA. The fatty acyl-CoA formed by this route is in a separate pool from that derived from exogenous free fatty acid and is used by the third enzyme, acyltransferase, to acylate a second molecule of exogenous lysophospholipid. Acyltransferase is accessible to exogenous and endogenous acyl-CoA. The high activity of this pathway in bloodstream forms, compared with procyclic culture form trypanosomes, suggests that it may play a role in the acquisition of fatty acids for synthesis of the membrane form of the variant surface glycoprotein. Extracellular myristoyllysophosphatidylcholine can be used by trypanosomes as a source of myristate in remodeling the lipid anchor of the variant surface glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1580514690,"In rat ovarian granulosa cell cultures, internalized cell surface heparan sulfate is processed by either a fast lysosome-mediated pathway or by a slow pathway which generates glycosaminoglycan fragments. Cell-associated dermatan sulfate proteoglycans also undergo processing through analogous pathways, although the slow pathway does not involve endoglycosidic cleavage of the dermatan sulfate chains. In the present study we tested whether intracellular glycosaminoglycan fragments in rat ovarian granulosa cells were transient residents of the nuclei. A technique for isolating nuclei was devised in which cells were lysed with a hypo-osmotic extraction buffer containing detergent. Nuclei were then purified by conventional methods, and final preparations gave excellent recovery of the starting DNA (approximately 90%). The technique was used to isolate glycosaminoglycans from nuclei after cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]sulfate. The results indicated the possible presence of dermatan sulfate, but not heparan sulfate, glycosaminoglycans at this location. Failure to remove cell surface proteoglycans with trypsin before preparation of nuclei resulted in nuclear contamination with significant amounts of intact dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. Nuclei preparations obtained using traditional homogenization steps from cells either treated without or with trypsin gave identical results except that recoveries of DNA were much lower (approximately 30%). The results demonstrate the difficulty in isolating pure nuclei and therefore also of firm conclusions pertaining to the nuclear association of glycosaminoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1507628433,"The interaction of factor Xa with factor Va on the membrane surface results in a 3,000-fold increase in the kcat for the activation of prothrombin catalyzed by factor Xa. The reaction between the transition state irreversible inhibitor dansylglutamyl-glycyl-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (DEGRck) and factor Xa was characterized and employed to evaluate changes in the active site of factor Xa resulting from its interaction with factor Va, which may account for the increased catalytic efficiency of the enzyme complex. Inhibition studies indicated a two-step inhibition reaction involving a reversible binding step (Ki = 1.13 microM) and an irreversible alkylation step (ki = 0.65 s-1). The interaction between factors Va and Xa in solution or on membranes resulted in a small decrease in the overall second-order rate constant (ki/Ki) for the inhibition reaction. The incorporation of DEGRck into the active site of factor Xa results in a large change in the fluorescence intensity of the dansyl moiety. The fluorescence change was employed to study the reaction between enzyme and inhibitor directly by stopped-flow fluorescence measurements. The fluorescence traces were biphasic, indicating that the association of DEGRck with factor Xa and the subsequent covalent modification of the active site could be resolved because of differences in fluorescence intensities of the intermediate and product. This interpretation was verified by rapid chemical quench experiments. The reaction between DEGRck and factor Xa was characterized by a second-order association rate constant of 8.38 +/- 0.28 x 10(5) M-1.s-1 and an intrinsic rate constant for the alkylation step of 1.67 +/- 0.25 s-1. The rate constant for the alkylation step was unchanged in the presence of factor Va and membranes, whereas the association rate constant was modestly decreased by approximately 50%. The decrease in the association rate constant did not result from the partitioning of factor Xa to the membrane surface and could therefore be ascribed to an effect of factor Va on the protease. The data suggest that the interaction between factors Va and Xa on the membrane surface does not detectably alter the catalytic residues but may result in changes in the binding or accessibility of substrate to extended macromolecular recognition sites on the protease."

It is shown that the reaction intermediate is best identified as a mixed-anhydride acylenzyme derivative in which the side chain of Glu-270 is acylated by the spin-label substrate, in agreement with previous cryoenzymological and spectroscopic studies from this laboratory. From the observed proton ENDOR shifts corresponding to principal hyperfine coupling components and assigned by selective deuteration, the dipolar hyperfine coupling components were calculated to estimate electron-proton distances. With these ENDOR-determined distances as constraints, the conformation of the substrate free in solution and in the active site of CPA has been determined on the basis of torsion angle search calculations. With a catalytically active, acetylated form of CPA, we have also assigned the position of the side chain of Tyr-198 with respect to the nitroxyl group. The positional assignments of both substrate and active-site residues in a true reaction intermediate provide important constraints in defining the structural basis of action of CPA."
https://openalex.org/W1578764505,"Expression of the germ cell alkaline phosphatase is a highly regulated process tied to malignant transformation of the human placenta. Human choriocarcinoma cells (malignant trophoblasts) express primarily the germ cell alkaline phosphatase gene and only low or nondetectable levels of the placental alkaline phosphatase normally found in the human placenta. Here, we show that nucleotides -156 to -1 region relative to the gene transcription start site (+1) contain cis-acting DNA elements that direct germ cell alkaline phosphatase expression in choriocarcinoma cells. Within the minimal activator region, at least three nuclear protein-binding sites, I (-63/-44), II (-87/-67), and III (-136/-103), were identified by DNase I footprinting analysis. All three sites are GC-rich. Sites I and II contain a sequence known to bind the transcription factor AP-2; the AP-2 site in site II overlaps a consensus motif for the transcription factor Sp1. Gel retardation experiments showed that similar nuclear protein factor(s) in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells bind to all three sites, with highest affinity to sites I and II. Site-directed mutagenesis that prevents binding of nuclear proteins to either site I or II, or both sites I and II, resulted in the loss of factor binding and reduced activator activity. The germ cell alkaline phosphatase promoter that contains an intact binding site III but altered sites I and II had little activator activity, suggesting that protein-protein interaction is important for germ cell alkaline phosphatase gene activation."

https://openalex.org/W1603177358,"Rabbit liver cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase exists as a set of subforms which exhibit different isoelectric points. Previous studies have shown that deamidation of an asparagine residue at position 5 of the amino acid sequence accounted for some of the charge heterogeneity (Artigues, A., Birkett, A., and Schirch, V. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4853-4858). The present study has also identified asparagine 220 as being partially deamidated. An estimated 25-30% of the purified enzyme contains an isoaspartyl residue at position 220. This suggests that deamidation of asparagine 220 occurs by the beta-aspartyl shift mechanism. Western blot analysis of purified cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase, after isoelectric focusing under reducing and denaturing conditions, showed four subforms of the individual subunits with respect to isoelectric point. Extracts from 3-day- and 3.5-year-old rabbit livers showed the presence of these same four subunit subforms. Purified cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase was found to be degraded in 24 h after mechanical injection into Xenopus laevis oocytes. However, when the first 14 amino acid residues are removed from the enzyme by digestion with chymotrypsin, leaving a fully catalytically active enzyme, the rate and extent of degradation of the truncated enzyme in oocytes were significantly reduced. One of the deamidated asparagine residues is at position 5, suggesting that this deamidation site may be a signal for degradation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1543536169,"To understand the mechanisms regulating the transactivating activity of Jun/AP-1, we analyzed alterations in c-Jun induced by growth stimulation and cell transformation. Serum stimulation of quiescent NIH3T3 cells induced a marked increase in phosphorylation of c-Jun in its amino-terminal activation domain. On the other hand, this domain was highly phosphorylated, in a serum-independent manner, in cells transformed with various oncogenes, including active c-raf-1, v-src, active Ha-ras, and active erbB-2. There were no obvious differences in the phosphorylation states of c-Jun in exponentially growing normal and transformed cells. However, in the exponentially growing state, the TRECAT activity in transformed cells was markedly higher than that in normal cells. Gel retardation analysis indicated that the AP-1 components in transformed cells were significantly different from those in normal cells. These results suggest that some other alterations besides phosphorylation of c-Jun are involved in enhancement of AP-1 activity in exponentially growing transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1533579151,"Abstract The structure of the acylenzyme intermediate in the hydrolysis of the specific spin-label ester substrate methyl N-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxypyrrolinyl-3-carbonyl)-L-tryptophan ate and its fluoro analogs catalyzed by alpha-chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) has been determined by electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and molecular modeling methods. By a combination of kinetic and cryoenzymological methods, we have established conditions to stabilize the spin-labeled acylenzyme reaction intermediate. Proton ENDOR features specific for the substrate were assigned on the basis of specific deuteration. From the observed ENDOR shifts for protons and fluorines that correspond to principal hyperfine coupling components, the dipolar hyperfine coupling contributions were calculated to estimate electron-nucleus distances. With these dipolar separations as constraints, conformations of the substrate both free in solution and in the active site of alpha-chymotrypsin were determined by molecular graphics analysis. Comparison of the conformation of the bound substrate to that of the free substrate showed that formation of the acylenzyme requires significant torsional alteration in substrate structure. The structural relationships between active-site residues and the substrate in its ENDOR-assigned conformation are examined with respect to the requirements of stereoelectronic rules for formation and breakdown of the acylenzyme species."
https://openalex.org/W1551993148,"Abstract The aqueous pore (P-region) of homotetrameric voltage-gated K+ channels has been modeled as a radially symmetrical eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel to which each of the four subunits contributes equally. This model has hydrogen bonding between residues located on adjacent subunits and predicts that subunit interactions might have functional consequences. Previously we have used point mutations and an electrophysiological assay to detect functional interactions between a pair of residues at positions 369 and 374 in the P-region, but we could not distinguish between intra- and intersubunit interactions. In the present paper, we present evidence for interaction across subunit boundaries after co-injecting two cRNAs encoding subunits differing from each other at either position 369 or 374. Comparison of the phenotypes of homo- and heterotetrameric channels suggests that pore residues residing in adjacent subunits form a closely packed structure which determines both ion conductance and stability of the open state of the channel. Our results are consistent with a structure in which pore residues 369 and 374 are located in close proximity on adjacent antiparallel strands to allow both intra- and intersubunit interactions."
