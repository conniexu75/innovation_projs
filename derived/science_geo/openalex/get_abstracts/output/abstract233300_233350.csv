https://openalex.org/W1986320887,"We describe the synthesis and properties of a small molecule mimic of Smac, a pro-apoptotic protein that functions by relieving inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (IAP)–mediated suppression of caspase activity. The compound binds to X chromosome– encoded IAP (XIAP), cellular IAP 1 (cIAP-1), and cellular IAP 2 (cIAP-2) and synergizes with both tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) to potently induce caspase activation and apoptosis in human cancer cells. The molecule has allowed a temporal, unbiased evaluation of the roles that IAP proteins play during signaling from TRAIL and TNF receptors. The compound is also a lead structure for the development of IAP antagonists potentially useful as therapy for cancer and inflammatory diseases."

We show that simple physical principles can mediate a coordinated interaction between genome and compartment boundary, independent of any genomic functions beyond self-replication. RNA, encapsulated in fatty acid vesicles, exerts an osmotic pressure on the vesicle membrane that drives the uptake of additional membrane components, leading to membrane growth at the expense of relaxed vesicles, which shrink. Thus, more efficient RNA replication could cause faster cell growth, leading to the emergence of Darwinian evolution at the cellular level."
https://openalex.org/W2034464608,"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is the principal structural component of caveolae membrane domains in non-muscle cells, including mammary epithelia. There is now clear evidence that caveolin-1 influences the development of human cancers. For example, a dominant-negative mutation (P132L) in the Cav-1 gene has been detected in up to 16% of human breast cancer samples. However, the exact functional role of caveolin-1 remains controversial. Mechanistically, in cultured cell models, Cav-1 is known to function as a negative regulator of the Rasp42/44 MAP kinase cascade and as a transcriptional repressor of cyclin D1 gene expression, possibly explaining its in vitro transformation suppressor activity. Genetic validation of this hypothesis at the in vivo and whole organismal level has been prevented by the lack of a Cav-1 (-/-)-null mouse model. Here, we examined the role of caveolin-1 in mammary tumorigenesis and lung metastasis using a molecular genetic approach. We interbred a well characterized transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, MMTV-PyMT (mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle T antigen), with Cav-1 (-/-)-null mice. Then, we followed the onset and progression of mammary tumors and lung metastases in female mice over a 14-week period. Interestingly, PyMT/Cav-1 (-/-) mice showed an accelerated onset of mammary tumors, with increased multiplicity and tumor burden (∼2-fold). No significant differences were detected between PyMT/Cav-1 (+/+) and PyMT/Cav-1 (+/-) mice, indicating that complete loss of caveolin-1 is required to accelerate both tumorigenesis and metastasis. Molecularly, mammary tumor samples derived from PyMT/Cav-1 (-/-) mice showed ERK-1/2 hyperactivation, cyclin D1 up-regulation, and Rb hyperphosphorylation, consistent with dys-regulated cell proliferation. PyMT/Cav-1 (-/-) mice also developed markedly advanced metastatic lung disease. Conversely, recombinant expression of Cav-1 in a highly metastatic PyMT mammary carcinoma-derived cell line, namely Met-1 cells, suppressed lung metastasis by ∼4.5-fold. In vitro, these Cav-1-expressing Met-1 cells (Met-1/Cav-1) demonstrated a ∼4.8-fold reduction in invasion through Matrigel-coated membranes. Interestingly, delivery of a cell permeable peptide encoding the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (residues 82-101) into Met-1 cells was sufficient to inhibit invasion. Coincident with this decreased invasive index, Met-1/Cav-1 cells exhibited marked reductions in MMP-9 and MMP-2 secretion and associated gelatinolytic activity, as well as diminished ERK-1/2 signaling in response to growth factor stimulation. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that caveolin-1 is a potent suppressor of mammary tumor growth and metastasis using novel in vivo animal model approaches.

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies identified caveolin-1 as a component of plasma membrane caveolae, small 50-100-nm omega-shaped invaginations involved in vesicular trafficking and cholesterol homeostasis (2Glenney Jr., J.R.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Analysis of its protein expression pattern revealed that Cav-1 is found in a diverse range of cell types, including adipocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and mammary epithelial cells (4Lisanti M.P.

It is now clear that the majority of caveolae require caveolin-1 for proper formation, indicating that Cav-1 is a requisite caveolar structural protein. For example, Cav-1 (-/-)-null mice lack morphologically identifiable caveolae in all cell types where Cav-1 is normally expressed (8Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B.

Since its initial discovery more than a decade ago, a variety of novel functions are now attributed to Cav-1, including a role in signal transduction. Caveolae, a type of membrane subdomain akin to lipid rafts, serve to compartmentalize many components of diverse signaling pathways that include Src family tyrosine kinases, eNOS, H-Ras, epidermal growth factor receptor, and G-proteins (11Okamoto T.

Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Cav-1 negatively regulates the activation state of many of these signaling molecules (13Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

From in vitro biochemical studies, it appears that the caveolin-scaffolding domain (residues 82-101 in Cav-1) is a modular protein domain that acts as a protein kinase inhibitor, by recognizing and binding to a specific aromatic amino acid motif located within the catalytic domain of many known serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (15Couet J. Li. S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 16Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Thus, Cav-1 may function as a natural endogenous inhibitor of a variety of signaling cascades, such as the Ras-p42/44 MAP kinase cascade (12Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 19Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). One prediction of this hypothesis is that loss of Cav-1 expression in vivo may lead to hyperactivation of p42/44 MAP kinase signaling. Potentially, this dysregulation could drive increases in tumorigenesis and/or metastasis in Cav-1 (-/-)-deficient mice, if they are provided with an oncogenic stimulus. Here, we test this hypothesis experimentally, using the mouse mammary gland as a model system. Elucidation of a role for Cav-1 in cellular transformation began with the observation that Cav-1 is down-regulated in oncogenically transformed cells (20Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Additional research demonstrated that the Cav-1 protein is down-regulated in human cancers, tumors derived from transgenic mice, and in human or rodent cancer cell lines, including breast tumors or breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, Lee et al. (7Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbell D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Cav-1 possesses a transformation suppressor function, as Cav-1 overexpression in human mammary cancer cells (T47D) results in tumor cell growth inhibition. Genetically, the CAV-1 gene is localized to a region on human chromosome 7q31.1 near microsatellite marker D7S522, a known fragile site (FRA7G) that is commonly deleted in a number of human cancers, including squamous cell carcinomas, ovarian carcinomas, colon carcinomas, and breast carcinomas (reviewed in Ref. 21Razani B. Schlegel A. Liu J. Lisanti M.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In terms of human breast cancer, one particular study demonstrated that up to 16% of patients with primary mammary tumors harbor a sporadic mutation at codon 132 (P132L) in CAV-1 (22Hayashi K. Matsuda S. Machida K. Yamamoto T. Fukuda Y. Nimura Y. Hayakawa T. Hamaguchi M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2361-2364PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CAV-1 (P132L) mutation behaves in a dominant-negative fashion, causing the intracellular retention of wild-type CAV-1 at the level of the Golgi complex (27Lee H. Park D.S. Razani B. Russell R.G. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1357-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recently, Han et al. (23Han S.E. Park K.H. Lee G. Huh Y.J. Min B.M. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 435-440PubMed Google Scholar) have also identified novel CAV-1 mutations in human oral squamous cell carcinomas. Mechanistically, in cultured cell models, Cav-1 is known to function as a negative regulator of the Ras-p42/44 MAP kinase cascade and as a transcriptional repressor of cyclin D1 gene expression, possibly explaining its in vitro transformation suppressor activity. However, genetic validation of this hypothesis at the in vivo and whole organismal level has been prevented by the lack of a Cav-1 (-/-)-null mouse model. In this report, we have employed MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice to directly explore the role of Cav-1 in tumor development and metastasis, using an autochthonous animal model. PyMT transgenic mice express high levels of this transforming oncogene under the control of the MMTV-LTR promoter, which specifically directs expression to the mammary epithelium (24Guy C.T. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). All female virgin PyMT transgenic mice rapidly develop multifocal mammary adenocarcinomas that are palpable, as early as 6-7 weeks of age. The benefit of this mouse tumor model over others is that female PyMT mice also develop pulmonary metastases by ∼3-4 months of age, with an extremely high penetrance (∼90-100%). Importantly, this mouse tumor model has been shown to recapitulate human breast cancer progression, from early hyperplasia to malignant breast carcinoma, including the up-regulation of ErbB2/Neu and cyclin D1 expression (25Maglione J.E. Moghanaki D. Young L.J. Manner C.K. Ellies L.G. Joseph S.O. Nicholson B. Cardiff R.D. MacLeod C.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8298-8305PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lin E.Y. Jones J.G. Li P. Zhu L. Whitney K.D. Muller W.J. Pollard J.W. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 2113-2126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). We interbred PyMT transgenic mice with Cav-1 null (-/-) mice to generate three genetically distinct cohorts of female mice that are all hemizygous for the PyMT transgene: 1) PyMT/Cav-1 (+/+); 2) PyMT/Cav-1 (+/-); and 3) PyMT/Cav-1 (-/-) mice. During a 14-week observation period, mice were evaluated for tumor onset, incidence, burden, and metastasis. We now demonstrate that genetic disruption of the caveolin-1 gene markedly increases tumorigenesis by reducing tumor latency, and increasing tumor multiplicity/burden, without altering histopathological progression. Mammary tumor samples derived from PyMT/Cav-1 (-/-) mice showed ERK-1/2 hyperactivation, cyclin D1 up-regulation, and Rb hyperphosphorylation, consistent with dysregulated cell proliferation. However, (i) no differences in PyMT expression or kinase-associated activity were detected in the absence of Cav-1; (ii) no alterations in the expression levels or phosphoactivation states among PyMT-associated proteins (Src, Shc, PI 3-kinase) were observed; and (iii) the genetic disruption of Cav-1 had no effect on the estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor status of these tumors. In addition, we find that an absence of caveolin-1 results in striking increases in the frequency of distant lung metastases from the primary site of origin. Finally, metastatic mammary tumor cells engineered to recombinantly express Cav-1 show significant reductions in Matrigel invasion and dramatically reduced MMP-9/MMP-2 activities. As such, this is the first demonstration that loss of caveolin-1 promotes mammary tumorigenesis and lung metastasis in an in vivo animal model. Materials and Expression Vectors—Mouse monoclonal antibodies to caveolin-1 (clones 2297 and 2234) were the generous gift of Dr. Roberto Campos-Gonzalez (BD Pharmingen, Inc.). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against total ERK-1/2, activated phospho-ERK-1/2, phospho-Rb (Ser-780), and phospho-Src (Tyr-416) were obtained from Cell Signaling, Inc. The anti-Rb rabbit polyclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., as well as rabbit polyclonal antibodies to ER, PR, c-Src, and MMP-2. Monoclonal antibodies directed against Shc, phospho-Shc, Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser-472/473), and PI 3-kinase were obtained from BD Pharmingen, Inc. A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for mouse MMP-9 was obtained from Triple Point Biologics, Inc. (Forest Grove, OR). Additional antibodies and their sources include anti-cyclin D1 rabbit pAb (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), anti-β-actin mAb AC-15 (Sigma), anti-β-tubulin mAb (Sigma), and anti-MT1-MMP mAb (Chemicon). Dr. William J. Muller generously provided a mouse monoclonal antibody (PAB 762) directed against PyMT. We have previously reported on the use of the retroviral vector pBABE for the delivery of cloned cDNAs (27Lee H. Park D.S. Razani B. Russell R.G. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1357-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A construct bearing the PyMT cDNA was generously provided by Dr. Robert Freund. Murine EGF and FGF-2 were purchased from PeproTech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Heparin, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), gelatin, and crystal violet were obtained from Sigma. GM6001 and N-sulfonylamino acid MMP-2/MMP-9-specific inhibitors I and II were all obtained from Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Cell Culture—All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Animal Studies—All animals were housed and maintained in a barrier facility at the Institute for Animal Studies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM). Mice were kept on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to chow (Picolab 20, PMI Nutrition International) and water. Animal protocols used for this study were approved by the AECOM Institute for Animal Studies. Cav-1-null mice and MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice (strain 634) were generated as previously described (8Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G. Di Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Matings were performed with PyMT male hemizygous mice. PyMT/Cav-1 (+/+) and PyMT/Cav-1 (+/-) male mice were interbred with Cav-1 (+/+) or Cav-1 (-/-) female mice to generate a cohort of Cav-1 (+/+), Cav-1 (+/-), or Cav-1 (-/-) female mice, all hemizygous for the PyMT transgene. None of the PyMT transgene-negative control mice developed tumors (n = 40). For the female tumor study, all the mice analyzed were virgin. Tumor Palpation and Excision—Female mice were palpated twice weekly beginning at 6 weeks of age for the development of tumors in their mammary glands. Mice were examined in a genotype-blinded fashion and palpated in each of the ten mammary glands up until 12 weeks of age. Beginning at 12 weeks, female mice were sacrificed, and all mammary tumors were carefully excised and weighed. Portions of the tumors were also frozen in liquid nitrogen or stored in formalin for fixation purposes. Identical procedures were performed on mice sacrificed at 13 and 14 weeks of age. For the male tumor study, mice were sacrificed at 23 weeks of age, and all tumors were excised, weighed, and fixed in formalin. Histological Analysis of Mammary Tumors—Mammary tumors were excised, cut into smaller portions, and fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin for over 24 h before embedding in paraffin. Sections were cut at 5 microns, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and evaluated by an experienced histopathologist (Dr. Neeru G. Chopra). Analyses, and descriptions were performed in accordance with the guidelines put forth by the mouse mammary gland pathology consensus meeting in Annapolis (29Cardiff R.D. Anver M.R. Gusterson B.A. Hennighausen L. Jensen R.A. Merino M.J. Rehm S. Russo J. Tavassoli F.A. Wakefield L.M. Ward J.M. Green J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 968-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Lung Metastasis Analysis—Female PyMT mice at 13 and 14 weeks of age were sacrificed and the lungs exposed by thoracic and tracheal dissection. Before removal, lungs were injected with 2 ml of 10% neutral buffered formalin by tracheal cannulation in order to fix the inner airspaces and inflate the lung lobes. Lungs were then excised and placed into formalin for 48 h. Lung lobes were separated in order to visualize all surfaces of each lobe. During counting, an equal number of lobes were matched for size and location in the thorax. Representative lungs were also paraffin-embedded and processed for histological analysis. For the Met-1 cell metastasis study, 1 × 105 cells suspended in 0.1 ml of PBS were injected through the tail vein of female athymic nude mice for each cell line. After 3 weeks, the lungs were removed and insuflated with 2 ml of 15% India Ink dye, washed in water for 5 min, and bleached in Fekete's solution (70% ethanol, 3.7% paraformaldehyde, 0.75 m glacial acetic acid). For the Met-1 metastasis study in wild-type and Cav-1 (-/-) FVB/N mice, 5 × 105 Met-1 cells were injected in 0.1 ml of PBS, and after 4 weeks, the lungs were removed and stained with India Ink. Surface lung metastases were scored in a genotype-blinded fashion under low power using a Nikon SMZ-1500 stereomicroscope. p values were determined by applying Mann-Whitney statistical analysis parameters, which does not assume a Gaussian distribution (non-parametric test). Immunoblot Analysis—150 to 200 mg portions of tumor tissue frozen in liquid nitrogen were homogenized in 2 ml of boiling lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside), containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), using a Polytron tissue grinder. Tissue lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble debris. For analyzing PyMT expression, tissue lysates were also precleared with protein G following centrifugation. Protein concentrations were analyzed using the BCA reagent (Pierce) and the volume required for 20-100 μg of protein was determined. Tissue or cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (8-12% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S (to visualize protein bands), followed by immunoblot analysis. Subsequent wash buffers contained 10 mm Tris pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-Tween), which was supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 4% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) for the blocking solution and 1% BSA for the antibody diluent. For phosphoantibody analysis, the blocking solution contained only 5% BSA in TBS-Tween (without nonfat milk). Primary antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse 1:10,000 dilution (Pierce) or anti-rabbit 1:5,000 (BD Pharmingen) were used to visualize bound primary antibodies, with the Supersignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Retroviral Vectors—PCR primers engineered with 5′-BamHI and 3′-EcoRI restriction sites were used to amplify the PyMT cDNA (generously provided by Dr. Robert Freund) for subcloning into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pBABE retroviral vector, yielding pBABE-PyMT. Individual pBABE-PyMT clones were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. The cloning of the murine Cav-1 cDNA into the pBABE retroviral vector was achieved through a similar strategy (pBABE-Cav-1). Retroviral Transduction—The retroviral pBABE constructs were transfected into Phoenix cells by a calcium phosphate precipitation method. About 6-8 h post-tranfection, cells were washed once with PBS, and the media was changed to complete growth medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin). Approximately 48 h post-transfection, the supernatant from transfected Phoenix cells was harvested, passed through a 0.45-μm filter to remove cellular debris, and mixed with polybrene (5 μg/ml). 2 × 105 cells of each cell line were infected with a 1:1 mixture of viral-containing supernatant and complete growth medium. Aspiration and infection was repeated every 12 h for a total of 3 cycles. To generate stable pools of pBABE-transfected cell lines, the cells were placed in complete growth media supplemented with puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) for 1 week, thus avoiding clonal variability. Nude Mouse Flank Injections—Female athymic immunodeficient (nude) mice at 6-8 weeks of age were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Briefly, immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or Db7 cells (a generous gift of Dr. Robert D. Cardiff) were suspended in sterile PBS at a concentration of 107 cells/ml, and 100 μl were injected subcutaneously into each flank of the nude mice. Mice were sacrificed at 6-weeks (MEFs) or 3-weeks (Db7) post-injection, at which point tumors were carefully excised to determine their weight. At least 10 injections were performed for each stable cell line, with the same cell line injected into both flanks of the same animal. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Met-1 cells (generous gift of Dr. Robert D. Cardiff, University of California-Davis) were grown on sterile glass coverslips, washed three times in PBS, and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/0.2% BSA/PBS for 10 min. Cells were then treated with 25 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at room temperature to quench free aldehyde groups. After rinsing with PBS, cells were incubated with primary antibody (anti-Cav-1 IgG mAb) diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100/0.2% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS for 10 min each, then incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS (10 min each wash), and mounted on a glass slide with slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). A cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera on an Olympus microscope was used for the detection of bound secondary antibodies. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in TNE buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitors), and 1 mg of lysate was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of a PyMT mouse monoclonal antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). As a control, pull-downs were performed in parallel with Sepharose beads without PyMT mAb pre-bound to them (beads alone). Sepharose beads were washed four times with TNE buffer and then resuspended in 10 μl of 2× kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 150 mm NaCl). Reactions were initiated by adding 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 10 μg of acid-denatured enolase. Reactions were inbuated at RT for 10 min before stopping with 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 2 min. Samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose after cutting away the leading edge of the gel (containing free [γ-32P]ATP), and exposed with an intensifying screen for 24 h at -80 °C. Cell Migration and Invasion Assays—The invasive potential of the tumor-derived cell lines was measured by an in vitro Boyden chamber assay (30Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 cells in 0.5 ml of serum-free DMEM were added to the wells of 8 μm pore membrane Boyden chambers, either coated with (for invasion assays) or without (for migration assays) Matrigel (Transwells; BD Biosciences). The lower chambers contained either 0"

A membrane-associated XBP was purified from human macula using ion-exchange chromatography followed by gel-exclusion chromatography. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed a prominent spot of 23 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.7. Using mass spectral sequencing methods and the public NCBI database, it was identified as a Pi isoform of human glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1).

(3R,3′S-meso)-Zeaxanthin, an optically inactive nondietary xanthophyll carotenoid present in the human macula, exhibited a strong induced CD spectrum in association with human macular XBP that was nearly identical to the CD spectrum induced by GSTP1. Like-wise, dietary (3R,3′R)-zeaxanthin displayed alterations in its CD spectrum in association with GSTP1 and XBP. Other mammalian xanthophyll carrier proteins such as tubulin, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, albumin, and β-lactoglobulin did not bind zeaxanthins with high affinity, and they failed to induce or alter xanthophyll CD spectra to any significant extent. Immunocytochemistry with an antibody to GSTP1 on human macula sections showed highest labeling in the outer and inner plexiform layers. These results indicate that GSTP1 is a specific XBP in human macula that interacts with (3R,3′S-meso)-zeaxanthin and dietary (3R,3′R)-zeaxanthin in contrast to apparently weaker interactions with (3R,3′R,6′R)-lutein.

Carotenoids are ubiquitous highly colored pigments synthesized exclusively by plants and microorganisms. Over 600 carotenoids have been isolated from natural sources, and ∼370 of these carotenoids are chiral, bearing one to five asymmetric carbon atoms (1Pfander H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 213: 3-13Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Many carotenoids are classified as xanthophylls because they contain at least one oxygen atom along their C40H56 isoprenoid core structure. Higher animals cannot synthesize carotenoids, but they can ingest them in their diet and subsequently utilize them for important physiological functions. Whereas >15 different dietary carotenoids are detectable in human serum, only lutein ((3R,3′R,6′R)-β,ϵ-carotene-3,3′-diol) and zeaxanthin (a mixture of (3R,3′R)-β,β-carotene-3,3′diol and (3R,3′S-meso)-β,β-carotene-3,3′-diol) (see Fig. 1) and their metabolites are found to any substantial extent in the retina (2Bernstein P.S.

High macular levels of these antioxidant and blue light-screening xanthophyll carotenoids are associated with decreased risk of age-related macular degeneration (5Moeller S.M. Jacques P.F.

Ophthalmology. 2002; 109: 1780-1787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), the leading cause of blindness in the developed world. In the foveal region of the macula of the primate retina, lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations are at their highest, and they are spatially localized to the outer plexiform layer (also known as the receptor axon or Henle fiber layer) and to the inner plexiform region (7Snodderly D.M. Auran J.D. Delori F.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 674-685PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the macular carotenoids falls precipitously outside of the foveal region, so that the concentration of lutein and zeaxanthin in the peripheral retina per unit area is 1% of the concentration at the fovea (8Snodderly D.M. Handelman G.J. Adler A.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 268-279PubMed Google Scholar), and a considerable portion of the extrafoveal carotenoids is associated with the rod outer segments (9Rapp L.M. Maple S.M. Choi J.H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1200-1209PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sommerberg O.G. Siems W.G. Hurst J.S. Lewis J.W. Kliger D.S. van Kuijk F.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1999; 19: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Whenever a tissue exhibits highly selective uptake and deposition of biological molecules, it is likely that specific binding proteins are involved. These binding proteins may act as cell surface receptors, transmembrane transport proteins, metabolic enzymes, intracellular mediators of the biological actions of the ligand, or sites for the deposition and stabilization of the ligand. Carotenoid-binding proteins have been described in plants (11Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), microorganisms (12Bullerjahn G.S. Sherman L.A. J.

In 1997, Rao et al. (16Rao M.N. Ghosh P. Lakshman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24455-24460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported the existence of a β-carotene-binding protein in ferret liver, although no sequence data have been provided yet. More recently, we have described the properties of a partially purified membrane-associated xanthophyll-binding protein (XBP) 1The abbreviations used are: XBP, xanthophyll-binding protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSTA, glutathione S-transferase Alpha; GSTM, glutathione S-transferase Mu; GSTP, glutathione S-transferase Pi; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; IEF, isoelectric focusing; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; THF, tetrahydrofuran; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; PBT, phosphate buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. found in human retina and macula (17Yemelyanov A.Y.

Photobiol. 2003; 78: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have also reported that retinal tubulin exhibits carotenoid binding properties (19Bernstein P.S. Balashov N.A. Tsong E.D. Rando R.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar, 20Crabtree D.V. Ojima I. Geng X. Adler A.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001; 9: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but with less specificity and affinity than XBP (17Yemelyanov A.Y. Katz N.B. Bernstein P.S. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 72: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Likewise, several other mammalian proteins such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), albumin, and β-lactoglobulin can act as carrier proteins for carotenoids, although there is no evidence that they do so with high specificity or affinity (17Yemelyanov A.Y.

In this study, we further purify human macular XBP and identify the major protein spot on two-dimensional gels as a Pi isoform of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1). Pharmacological and spectroscopic binding studies with human recombinant GSTP1 demonstrate that its interactions with zeaxanthin closely match those of XBP purified from human macula. Preparation of Solubilized Membrane Extracts from Human Macula—Preparation of XBP was based on previously published methods (17Yemelyanov A.Y. Katz N.B. Bernstein P.S. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 72: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Thawed human maculae (6–8 mm punches) originating from 15 postmortem eyes (average age, 40 ± 10 years) were homogenized in 1.0 ml of a cell lysing solution containing protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 15% (w/v) sucrose. Sucrose density gradient (5–50% (w/v)) centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 30 min at 2 °C resulted in a low-density yellow-colored band containing XBP. The yellow fraction was diluted with Tris buffer (pH 7.4) to bring the sucrose concentration down to 5% (w/v). A high-speed ultracentrifugation of the diluted yellow fraction was performed at 200,000 × g for 60 min at 2 °C. The high-speed supernatant was discarded, and the yellow high-speed pellet was solubilized with brief sonication on ice into 500 μl of 25 mm CHAPS in 20 mm MES buffer (pH 5.5) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 2 °C. The CHAPS-insoluble pellet was resolubilized into CHAPS/MES buffer several more times, followed by high-speed centrifugation as described above. The pale yellow CHAPS-solubilized supernatants were combined and concentrated to 500 μl using an Ultrafree centrifugal filtration system (Millipore, Woburn, MA; molecular mass cutoff, 10 kDa). Ion-exchange Chromatography and Silica Gel Chromatography of XBP—Protein chromatography was performed on a BioLogic liquid chromatography system (Bio-Rad). Detergent-solubilized human macular membrane extracts were loaded immediately after preparation onto an Amersham Biosciences S cation-exchange column (7 × 35 mm,(SO3−)exchanging groups). Initial buffer conditions were 20 mm MES buffer containing 8 mm CHAPS at pH 5.5 run at 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C for 15 min, followed by a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl over 15 min. At later purification stages, anion-exchange chromatography was performed on an Amersham Biosciences Q column (7 × 35 mm,(N(CH3)3+)exchanging groups). Initial buffer conditions were 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 8 mm CHAPS, followed by a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl over 20 min. Silica gel chromatography was done using a silica gel filtration column (BIOSEP-SEC-S 3000 PEEK; 300 × 7.80 mm; separation range, 5–700 kDa; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Concentrated fractions (up to 200 μl) from the ion-exchange columns were loaded onto the gel filtration column, and 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 8 mm CHAPS was used as the eluant at a 0.3 ml/min flow rate. At all stages of chromatographic purification, the eluates were monitored by a UV6000LP photodiode array spectrophotometer equipped with a high sensitivity 50 mm pathlength light-pipe flowcell with an internal volume of 10 μl (Thermo Separations, San Jose, CA), and 300 μl fractions were collected. The fractions of interest containing proteins associated with endogenous macular carotenoids exhibited strong 280 nm protein absorbance and prominent triple peak vibronic structure centered at ∼460 nm, typical of most xanthophyll carotenoids. Carotenoid Extraction and HPLC—Fifty μl of purified fractions at each stage of column chromatography were treated with 100 μl of methanol to disrupt ligand-protein associations, and they were then extracted into 200 μl of hexane. Phase separation was promoted by the addition of 20 μl of saturated sodium chloride. The organic extracts were dried by vacuum evaporation in a Speedvac Plus (SC110; Savant, Cambridge, MA) and redissolved in 1 ml of HPLC mobile phase (hexane:dichloromethane:methanol:N,N′-di-isopropylethylamine, 80:19.2: 0.7:0.1 (v/v)). HPLC separation was carried out at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min on a cyano column (Microsorb 25-cm length × 4.6-mm inner diameter; Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The column was maintained at room temperature, and the HPLC detector was operated at 450 nm. Peak identities were confirmed by photodiode array spectra and by coelution with authentic standards as necessary. Peak areas were integrated and quantified with an external standardization curve. Two-dimensional Isoelectric Focusing and Electrophoresis—Isoelectric focusing (IEF) separations were done using precast immobilized pH gradient gel strips (pH 5–8; strip length, 11 cm; Bio-Rad). The immobilized pH gradient strips were rehydrated overnight in trays loaded with the protein samples in the manufacturer's sample buffer. Isoelectric focusing was performed in a Bio-Rad Protean IEF cell unit at 20 °C, with a maximum current of 50 μA/strip. The end voltage for the IEF run was 8,000 V. The strips were equilibrated with buffers containing dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide. After SDS-PAGE on a 1-mm-thick 4–20% gradient Tris-HCl gel, protein spots were stained with fluorescent Sypro Ruby protein stain (Bio-Rad). Gels were then visualized and documented (AlphaDigiDoc 1201; Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) using a UV light source. Detected spots were processed for mass spectral identification. Mass Spectral Protein Identification—Excised protein samples were digested in-gel with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega), according to a previously reported method (24Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Digests were desalted and concentrated to 4 μl by solid-phase extraction using μC18 ZipTips (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) plate was then spotted with 1 μl of sample and 1 μl of α-cyano-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. Mass spectrometry employed a QSTAR Pulsar instrument equipped with a MALDI source (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation was performed on parent ions representing each peptide. The collision-induced fragmentation spectrum for each parent ion was then submitted to the Mascot web site (Matrix Science, London, United Kingdom) for database searching. Carotenoid Binding Assays—Synthetic (3R,3′R)-zeaxanthin and (3R,3′S-meso)-zeaxanthin were gifts from DSM Nutritional Products (Kaiseraugst, Switzerland), and (3R,3′R,6′R)-lutein prepared from marigold flowers was a gift from Kemin Foods (Des Moines, IA). XBP requires CHAPS detergent to maintain solubility and stability during purification, and the CHAPS detergent also aids in solubilizing the xanthophyll carotenoid ligands; therefore, all carotenoid binding experiments for XBP and other proteins were done in the presence of identical concentrations of CHAPS. In a typical binding experiment, 10 μlof concentrated carotenoids (1–250 μm) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) were added to 490 μl of 50 mm Tris-CHAPS (8 mm) buffer containing 1 μg of protein (∼0.1 μm, based on a subunit molecular mass of 23 kDa). After brief mixing, the mixture was incubated overnight (16 h) at 4 °C. Kinetic binding studies with (3R,3′R,6′R)-lutein, (3R,3′R)-zeaxanthin, and (3R,3′S-meso)-zeaxanthin demonstrated that equilibrium was reached within 12–14 h. Unbound carotenoids were removed by four cycles of extraction with 200 μl of hexane, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,800 × g in a microcentrifuge and removal of the organic solvent layer. Residual hexane was removed from the extracted sample under a stream of argon. THF and hexane were chosen in the protocol as the preferred organic solvents for carotenoid delivery and extraction because they do not typically lead to denaturation of carotenoid-binding proteins (16Rao M.N. Ghosh P. Lakshman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24455-24460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Yemelyanov A.Y. Katz N.B. Bernstein P.S. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 72: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). During all experimental procedures, the samples remained clear, with no signs of precipitation. In many cases, UV-visible absorption and CD spectra were measured before extraction and HPLC carotenoid analysis. Computerized nonlinear regression analyses of binding parameters using one- and two-site models were performed using PRISM version 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All binding curves and calculations were corrected for nonspecific binding by subtracting parallel incubations in which protein had been omitted. Binding assays were performed in a similar manner at equivalent protein concentrations with human recombinant glutathione S-transferase isoforms GSTP1, GSTA1, and GSTM1, and with other mammalian carotenoid carrier proteins, bovine brain tubulin, human serum HDL, human serum LDL, bovine milk β-lactoglobulin, and human serum albumin (essentially fatty acid-free). All of these commercially prepared proteins were obtained from Sigma. Spectral Measurements—CD spectra were recorded at 4 °C ± 0.2 °C with an Aviv Associates CD spectrophotometer (Model 62 DS; Lakewood, NJ). Spectra were recorded at a scan speed of 10 nm/min and a spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm. Quartz cells with pathlengths of 1 mm were used for all CD measurements, and the spectra were obtained in the wavelength range of 200–700 nm. Each spectrum was the average of 10 replicate scans in steps of 1 nm. All measurements were reported in millidegrees of ellipticity (m°). The UV-visible absorption measurements on the samples were done using an absorption spectrophotometer (Lambda 9; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature at a scan speed of 30 nm/min with 1 nm resolution in quartz cells with pathlengths of 1 mm. Immunocytochemistry and Western Blotting—Human donor eyes were obtained from the Utah Lions Eye Bank (Salt Lake City, UT). After removal of the anterior segment and vitreous, the eye cup from a 23-year-old multiple organ donor was fixed 3 h post-mortem using freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 90 min, rinsed, and cryoprotected overnight in 30% sucrose in buffer. Subsequently, a rectangular piece of retina centered approximately on the fovea was isolated, embedded in TBS tissue-freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC), and frozen. Cryosections (14 μm thick) were cut, rinsed in 0.1 m PBT, and blocked for 1 h using 10% normal donkey serum in PBT. Antibodies to GSTP1 (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX; GSTP1-S; 1:200 dilution) and cone arrestin (7G6 from Peter R. MacLeish; Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA; 1:500 dilution) were applied overnight at 4 °C. The polyclonal antibody against GSTP1 was raised in rabbit using HPLC-purified rat protein as the immunogen. After rinsing in three 10-min PBT washes, rhodamine- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA; catalog no. 711-295-152 and 715-096-150; each used at a 1:200 dilution) were applied for 2 h at room temperature to visualize sites of label. The immunolocalization was imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope set to an optical slice of <0.9 μm. Control sections, in which incubation in primary antibodies was omitted, were processed in parallel and found to be negative for immunoreactivity. Protein samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters using a Bio-Rad trans-blot apparatus at 100 V for 2 h. Nonspecific binding was blocked by immersing the membrane in 5% nonfat dried milk, 0.1% Tween 20, in 1% donkey serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker. The membrane was briefly rinsed with two changes of wash buffer and incubated with diluted primary antibody (1:400; rabbit anti-rat GSTP1) for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker. After two changes of wash buffer, peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified secondary antibody was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (1:800; donkey anti-rabbit IgG; catalog no. 711-035-1520; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The membrane was incubated in the diluted secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker and then developed using ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of Human Macular XBP—We have reported previously that partially purified membrane preparations from human macula have saturable and specific binding sites for xanthophyll carotenoids (17Yemelyanov A.Y. Katz N.B. Bernstein P.S. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 72: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we have improved the XBP purification protocol by the addition of a sucrose gradient centrifugation step before detergent solubilization and by enhanced chromatographic separations. XBP is a membrane-associated protein; therefore, it is necessary to use detergents to solubilize the protein during chromatographic separations. Our previously reported protocol for purification of XBP utilized CHAPS, an excellent detergent for studying membrane-associated proteins (17Yemelyanov A.Y. Katz N.B. Bernstein P.S. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 72: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Hjelmeland L.M. Chrambach A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). CHAPS, like most detergents useful in protein purifications, is a chiral molecule (26Kropf A. Vis. Res. 1982; 22: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because these chiral detergents can complicate interpretation of circular dichroism studies performed for characterization of proteins, we also explored the use of nonchiral detergents such as Triton X-100 for purification. Unfortunately, XBP was unstable in all nonchiral detergents that we examined. Thus, all protein studies reported here included CHAPS in the buffer, and suitable controls were always incorporated in the experimental protocols to correct for the presence of a chiral detergent. The light yellow XBP fraction that elutes from the final silica gel chromatography step exhibits a characteristic carotenoid absorbance profile, displaying a primary peak at 468 nm, with secondary peaks at 438 and 488 nm (Fig. 2). HPLC analysis of the most purified fractions confirms that both zeaxanthin and lutein are present in a ratio of 2.5:1. XBP purified from human macula carrying only endogenous carotenoids displayed a consistent A460/A280 of ∼0.5. Addition of saturating amounts of exogenous lutein or zeaxanthin to XBP, followed by hexane extraction to remove unbound excess carotenoids, raised the A460/A280 ratio to 1.5, indicating that chromatographically purified macular XBP is ∼30% saturated with endogenous carotenoids. Mass Spectral Analysis of Highly Purified Human Macular XBP—One-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels of chromatographically purified human macular XBP have only a single major band at ∼23 kDa, but two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE reveals that there are actually four 21–23-kDa spots with isoelectric points ranging from 5.7 to 7.5 when stained with Sypro Ruby. These are designated as spots A-D in Fig. 3. Because it is the strongest staining and presumably the most abundant protein in our XBP fraction, we first performed mass spectral sequencing on spot A (isoelectric point, 5.7). We reproducibly detected three strong tryptic peptides at m/z 1337.7, 1883.9, and 2126.2 on several two-dimensional gels from independent preparations. These peptides were further analyzed using collision-induced fragmentation techniques to obtain additional sequence information on them. Using a Mascot search engine and the public NCBI database, we were able to positively identify spot A as GSTP1. The three peptides correspond to the sequences PPYTVVYFPVR, FQDGDLTLYQSNTILR, and ALPGQLKPFETLLSQNQGGK, covering 22.5% of the 209-amino acid sequence of GSTP1 at positions 1–11, 55–70, and 121–140. Our MS/MS spectra match fragmentation patterns predicted from these sequences. Spot B was observed to have an isoelectric point of 7.5. Tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry yielded strong molecular ions of m/z 1654.8 and 1745.8. On further examination of their MS/MS spectra, it is clear that these two species are related; the apparent peptide at m/z 1745.8 is actually the 1654.8 peptide with an as yet undefined posttranslational modification. Neither of the collision-induced fragmentation spectra from these parent ions matches any fragmentation patterns predicted for peptides in the public or private databases, and the MS/MS spectra have not been suitable for definitive de novo sequencing. Spots C and D with molecular masses of 21–23 kDa and isoelectric points of 6.2 and 6.5, respectively, have not yet been identified. Xanthophyll Binding and Spectral Studies with GSTP1 and XBP—Binding of exogenous dietary (3R,3′R)-zeaxanthin and nondietary (3R,3′S-meso)-zeaxanthin to recombinant human GSTP1 was saturable with apparent dissociation constants of 0.33 and 0.52 μm (Fig. 4), respectively, somewhat lower than the dissociation constants of 1–2 μm that we reported previously for the interaction of partially purified human macular XBP with lutein and zeaxanthin (17Yemelyanov A.Y. Katz N.B. Bernstein P.S. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 72: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ligand/protein ratio for both forms of zeaxanthin to the 23-kDa monomer of GSTP1 was observed to be 2.0 at saturation, and two-site binding modeling provided no evidence for receptor heterogeneity. Our binding studies generally did not have glutathione present in the buffer, and the addition of up to 1 mm glutathione did not alter zeaxanthin binding to GSTP1. We were unable to assess the impact of xanthophyll binding on the GST activity of GSTP1 because the CHAPS detergent required for xanthophyll binding inhibited its GST activity. When we examined other GST isoforms such as human recombinant GSTM1 and GSTA1, we observed low-affinity binding without definite evidence of saturation (Fig. 4). Although we have demonstrated previously that human macular XBP can bind exogenous lutein (17Yemelyanov A.Y. Katz N.B. Bernstein P.S. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 72: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we were unable to demonstrate high-affinity specific binding of lutein to any of the three isoforms of recombinant human GST (Fig. 4). We also compared GSTP1 with a series of mammalian proteins thought to interact with xanthophyll carotenoids (tubulin, albumin, HDL, LDL, and β-lactoglobulin). No high-affinity saturable zeaxanthin binding comparable with GSTP1 was detectable (Fig. 5), although albumin did exhibit saturable high-affinity binding for lutein (Kd, 0.54 μm; 3 binding sites/molecule).Fig. 5Binding studies of GSTP1, tubulin, albumin, HDL, LDL, and β-lactoglobulin with macular xanthophylls. Ten μl of concentrated (3R,3′R)-zeaxanthin (top panel), (3R,3′S-meso)-zeaxanthin (middle panel), and (3R,3′R,6′R)-lutein (bottom panel) dissolved in THF were added to 490 μl of 50 mm Tris-CHAPS (8 mm) buffer containing 1 μg of protein (GSTP1, ▪; bovine brain tubulin, ▾; human serum albumin, □; human HDL, ▴; human LDL, ♦; bovine β-lactoglobulin, •).

https://openalex.org/W2014205131,"Human light chain 3/MAP1LC3B, an autophagosomal ortholog of yeast Atg8, is conjugated to phospholipid (PL) via ubiquitylation-like reactions mediated by human Atg7 and Atg3. Since human Atg4B was found to cleave the carboxyl terminus of MAP1LC3B in vitro, we hypothesized that this exposes its carboxyl-terminal Gly120. It was recently reported, however, that when Myc-MAP1LC3B-His is expressed in HEK293 cells, its carboxyl terminus is not cleaved. (Tanida, I., Sou, Y.-s., Ezaki, J., Minematsu-Ikeguchi, N., Ueno, T., and Kominami, E. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 36268–36276). To clarify this contradiction, we sought to determine whether the carboxyl terminus of MAP1LC3B is cleaved to expose Gly120 for further ubiquitylation-like reactions. When MAP1LC3B-3xFLAG and Myc-MAP1LC3B-His were expressed in HEK293 cells, their carboxyl termini were cleaved, whereas there was little cleavage of mutant proteins MAP1LC3BG120A-3xFLAG and Myc-MAP1LC3BG120A-His, containing Ala in place of Gly120. An in vitro assay showed that Gly120 is essential for carboxyl-terminal cleavage by human Atg4B as well as for formation of the intermediates Atg7-MAP1LC3B (ubiquitin-activating enzyme-substrate) and Atg3-MAP1LC3B (ubiquitin carrier protein-substrate). Recombinant MAP1LC3B-PL was fractionated into the 100,000 × g pellet in a manner similar to that shown for endogenous MAP1LC3B-PL. RNA interference of MAP1LC3B mRNA resulted in a decrease in both endogenous MAP1LC3B-PL and MAP1LC3B. These results indicate that the carboxyl terminus of MAP1LC3B is cleaved to expose Gly120 for further ubiquitylation-like reactions.

Autophagy is the bulk degradation of proteins and organelles essential for cellular maintenance and viability. Autophagy has significant associations with neurodegenerative diseases, cardiomyopathies, cancer, programmed cell death, and bacterial and viral infections (1Klionsky D.J. Autophagy.

Among the autophagosomal marker proteins are Atg8/Apg8/Aut7 in yeast and light chain 3 (LC3) 1The abbreviations used are: LC3, light chain 3; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; h, human; PL, phospholipid; GABARAP, γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-associated protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRX, thioredoxin. in mammals (2Kirisako T.

The molecular mechanism of Atg8 lipidation has been well characterized in yeast. The carboxyl terminus of Atg8 is cotranslationally cleaved by Atg4/Apg4/Aut2, a cysteine protease, to expose a carboxyl-terminal Gly (4Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y.

Phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated Atg8 is finally localized to autophagosomes under starvation conditions and to Cvt vesicles under nutrient-rich conditions. In mammalian cells, the Atg8-like modification system for formation of autophagosomes seems to be conserved. The carboxyl terminus of rat LC3 is cleaved, exposing Gly120, a residue that is essential for the cleavage and modification of LC3-I to LC3-II (3Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). Modification of rat LC3-I to LC3-II is facilitated under starvation conditions. During ultracentrifugation, rat LC3-II is fractionated into the 100,000 × g pellet, and LC3-II localizes to autophagosomes. Human (h) LC3/MAP1LC3B, one of three orthologs of rat MAP1LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1light chain 3), shows significant homology to rat LC3 (3Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A.

We recently showed that endogenous MAP1LC3B-II isolated from HeLa cells is an LC3-phospholipid (PL) conjugate (MAP1LC3B-PL); that purified hAtg4B cleaves the carboxyl terminus of MAP1LC3B in vitro; and that, during ultracentrifugation, MAP1LC3B-PL is fractionated into the pellet (11Tanida I.

Since the exposure of a carboxyl-terminal Gly of a ubiquitin-like modifier (e.g. ubiquitin, SUMO-1, Nedd8, Atg12, Atg8, γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), and Ufm1) is essential for further ubiquitylation-like reactions, we hypothesized that the carboxyl-terminal Gly120 of MAP1LC3B is exposed in vivo and that MAP1LC3B is an authentic modifier, as is rat LC3. In contrast to our finding that the carboxyl terminus of MAP1LC3B is cleaved to expose Gly120, it was recently reported that recombinant Myc-MAP1LC3B-His protein does not undergo carboxyl-terminal cleavage and that human MAP1LC3B is post-translationally modified at Lys122 without any carboxyl-terminal cleavage (13He H. Dang Y. Dai F. Guo Z. Wu J. She X. Pei Y. Chen Y. Ling W. Wu C. Zhao S. Liu J.O. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29278-29287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).

To clarify whether the exposure of Gly120 by carboxyl-terminal cleavage of MAP1LC3B is essential for further ubiquitylation-like reactions, we investigated the effects of Gly120 and Lys122 on carboxyl-terminal cleavage. We also determined whether Gly120 is essential for the formation of E1- and E2-substrate intermediates as well as whether overexpression of MAP1LC3B increases the amount of MAP1LC3B-PL in addition to free MAP1LC3. We also tested the effect of RNA interference of MAP1LC3B mRNA on endogenous MAP1LC3B-PL and MAP1LC3B. Our results indicate that MAP1LC3B is cleaved in vivo to expose Gly120 and is modified to MAP1LC3B-PL at this residue by hAtg7 and hAtg3.

Chem. 2004; 279: 36268-36276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and that the carboxyl-terminal Gly120 of rat LC3 is essential for its modification (3Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). Since there is significant identity between MAP1LC3B and rat LC3 (Fig. 1A), we expected that carboxyl-terminal cleavage of MAP1LC3B would expose Gly120. However, using a recombinant Myc-MAP1LC3B-His protein, in which MAP1LC3B was fused to the Myc epitope at its amino terminus and to the His6 tag at its carboxyl terminus, it was reported that the carboxyl terminus of human MAP1LC3B is not cleaved and that it is modified at Lys122, but not at Gly120 (13He H. Dang Y. Dai F. Guo Z. Wu J. She X. Pei Y. Chen Y. Ling W. Wu C. Zhao S. Liu J.O. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29278-29287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). If Gly120 is not exposed, the subsequent E1 and E2 reactions could not occur. To minimize any artificial effect of an amino-terminal tag on the LC3 modification, we first investigated carboxyl-terminal cleavage of MAP1LC3B using a series of mutant MAP1LC3B-3xFLAG proteins, in which MAP1LC3B was fused to three repeats of the FLAG epitope at its carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1B). MAP1LC3B-3xFLAG was expressed in HEK293 cells; total cell lysate proteins were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; and MAP1LC3B in the lysate was assayed by immunoblotting with anti-MAP1LC3B antibody. Two bands corresponding to MAP1LC3B and MAP1LC3B-PL were recognized by anti-MAP1LC3B antibody (Fig. 1C, left panel, WT), but not by anti-FLAG antibody (right panel, WT). Expression of mutant MAP1LC3BG120A-3xFLAG, in which Gly120 of MAP1LC3B was changed to Ala, resulted in a single band (of slower mobility compared with wild-type MAP1LC3B) that was recognized by immunoblotting with both anti-MAP1LC3B and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 1C, G120A). We next investigated the effect of MAP1LC3B Lys122 on the cleavage reaction. Expression of MAP1LC3BK122A-3xFLAG, in which Lys122 of MAP1LC3B was changed to Ala, resulted in two bands corresponding to MAP1LC3B and MAP1LC3B-PL, both of which were recognized by immunoblotting with anti-MAP1LC3B antibody, but not with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1C, K122A versus WT), indicating that Lys122 has no effect on the carboxyl-terminal cleavage of MAP1LC3B. We obtained similar results for MAP1LC3BG120A and MAP1LC3BK122A fused to the GFP protein at the carboxyl terminus and expressed in HeLa and HEK293 cells (data not shown). These results were consistent with our hypothesis derived from biochemical evidence (9Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 10Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol.

Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To clarify in a straightforward manner whether the carboxyl terminus of Myc-MAP1LC3B-His is cleaved in vivo, we constructed a series of mutant Myc-MAP1LC3B-His proteins (Fig. 1D). When Myc-MAP1LC3B-His protein was expressed in HEK293 cells, two bands corresponding to the cytosolic and lipidated forms of Myc-MAP1LC3B were recognized by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody, but not with anti-His antibody (Fig. 1E, WT). Similar results were obtained when Myc-MAP1LC3BK122A-His and Myc-MAP1LC3BK122R-His were expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1E, K122R and K122A). Expression of mutant Myc-MAP1LC3BG120A-His resulted in a single band (of faster mobility compared with wild-type Myc-MAP1LC3B-His on SDS-polyacrylamide gel) that was recognized by both anti-Myc and anti-His antibodies (Fig. 1E, G120A). Mutation of Gly120 to Ala showed that His6 at the carboxyl terminus affects the mobility of non-cleaved mutant Myc-MAP1LC3BG120A-His on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. These results indicate that cleavage of the carboxyl terminus of MAP1LC3B in HEK293 cells requires Gly120, but not Lys122. Gly120 Is Essential for the Carboxyl-terminal Cleavage of MAP1LC3B by hAtg4B in Vitro—We further investigated the significance of Gly120 for carboxyl-terminal cleavage using an in vitro assay for cleavage of MAP1LC3B by hAtg4B (Fig. 2). We prepared three recombinant proteins: TRX-MAP1LC3B-Myc (in which MAP1LC3B was fused to TRX-His6 at its amino terminus and to the Myc epitope at its carboxyl terminus), TRX-MAP1LC3BG120A-Myc, and TRX-MAP1LC3BΔG-Myc (in which Gly120 was deleted) (Fig. 2A). When wild-type TRX-MAP1LC3B-Myc was incubated with FLAG-hAtg4B at 37 °C for 30 and 60 min, a band corresponding to the protein, which was recognized by immunoblotting with anti-TRX antibody, had a faster mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel than before incubation (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3), and this faster band was not recognized by anti-Myc antibody. When TRX-MAP1LC3BG120A-Myc and TRX-MAP1LC3BΔG-Myc were used as substrates for FLAG-hAtg4B, they were recognized by both anti-TRX and anti-Myc antibodies, even after incubation for 60 min (Fig. 2B, lanes 4–9), and both showed little shift in mobility. In each reaction mixture, FLAG-hAtg4B was recognized after incubation for 60 min (Fig. 2B, lanes 10–15). These results indicate that Gly120 of MAP1LC3B is essential for its carboxyl-terminal cleavage by FLAG-hAtg4B in vitro. Gly120, but Not Lys122, of MAP1LC3B Is Essential for Formation of E1- and E2-Substrate Intermediates—We previously showed that when the mammalian Atg7C567S active-site mutant is expressed together with GFP-MAP1LC3B, the two proteins form a stable E1-substrate intermediate (15Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Nishitani T. Komatsu M. Yamazaki H. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, mutant hAtg7C572S (in which the active-site Cys572 for the E1-like reaction was changed to Ser) forms stable intermediates with the other Atg8 orthologs, human GATE-16 and GABARAP, with Gly116 in the latter two proteins being essential for the E1 reaction (11Tanida I. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was not clear, however, whether Gly120 (or Lys122) of MAP1LC3B is essential for the formation of the hAtg7C572S-MAP1LC3B (E1-substrate) intermediate. To avoid any effect of an amino-terminal tag on MAP1LC3B in its E1 and E2 reactions with hAtg7 and hAtg3, we constructed a series of mutant MAP1LC3B proteins without any tag (Fig. 3A) and expressed these proteins together with hAtg7C572S in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 6–10). Total cell lysate proteins were separated on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and MAP1LC3B and hAtg7 were recognized by immunoblotting with their respective antibodies. When wild-type MAP1LC3B and hAtg7C572S were expressed, both the hAtg7C572S-MAP1LC3B (E1-substrate) intermediate and the free proteins were recognized (Fig. 3B, lane 6 versus lane 1). E1-substrate intermediates were also observed when hAtg7C572S was expressed together with MAP1LC3B-TFG, in which the five carboxyl-terminal amino acids (MKLSV) were deleted to expose Gly120, or MAP1LC3BK122A (Fig. 3B, lanes 8 and 10). When MAP1LC3B, MAP1LC3B-TFG, or MAP1LC3BK122A alone was expressed, however, little intermediate was observed (Fig. 3B, lanes 1, 3, and 5). Similarly, there was little intermediate when hAtg7C572S was expressed together with MAP1LC3B-TF, in which the six carboxyl-terminal amino acids (GMKLSV) were deleted (Fig. 3B, lane 7 versus lane 8), or with MAP1LC3BG120A (lane 9). Similar results were obtained when a series of mutant FLAG-MAP1LC3B and GFP-MAP1LC3B proteins were expressed instead of MAP1LC3B (data not shown). These findings indicate that MAP1LC3B can react with hAtg7 after carboxyl-terminal cleavage of the latter and that exposure of Gly120 is essential for the E1-like reaction mediated by hAtg7, whereas Lys122 contributes little to it. We previously showed that MAP1LC3B forms an E2-substrate intermediate with hAtg3C264S, in which the active-site Cys264 was changed to Ser, in the presence of wild-type hAtg7 (10Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13739-13744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It was unclear, however, whether Gly120 (or Lys122) of MAP1LC3B is essential for the formation of the hAtg3C264S-MAP1LC3B (E2-substrate) intermediate. To determine whether Gly120 is essential for formation of this intermediate, we expressed a series of mutant MAP1LC3B proteins together with wild-type hAtg7 and mutant GFP-hAtg3C264S (Fig. 3B, lanes 11–15). After separation of total cell lysate proteins on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, MAP1LC3B, hAtg7, and GFP-hAtg3 were recognized by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. When MAP1LC3B-TFG or MAP1LC3BK122A was expressed together with hAtg7 and GFP-hAtg3C264S, GFP-hAtg3C264S-MAP1LC3B (E2-substrate) intermediates were observed by immunoblotting, similar to the results observed with wild-type MAP1LC3B (Fig. 3B, upper and lower panels, lanes 11, 13, and 15). In contrast, when MAP1LC3B-TF or MAP1LC3BG120A was expressed together with hAtg7 and GFP-hAtg3C264S, little E2-substrate intermediate was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B, lanes 12 and 14). These results indicate that MAP1LC3B can react with hAtg3 and that the exposure of Gly120 is essential for this E2 reaction, whereas Lys122 contributes little to it. In contrast to a report that the carboxyl terminus of Myc-MAP1LC3B-His is not cleaved (13He H. Dang Y. Dai F. Guo Z. Wu J. She X. Pei Y. Chen Y. Ling W. Wu C. Zhao S. Liu J.O. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29278-29287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we found that the carboxyl terminus of wild-type Myc-MAP1LC3B-His was cleaved in vivo (Fig. 1E). If the Gly120 of Myc-MAP1LC3B-His is exposed after carboxyl-terminal cleavage, Myc-MAP1LC3B-His will form E1- and E2-substrate intermediates with hAtg7C572S and hAtg3C264S, respectively. We therefore investigated whether Myc-MAP1LC3B-His can react with hAtg7C572S and hAtg3C264S. As shown for untagged MAP1LC3B (Fig. 3B), Myc-MAP1LC3B-His formed these intermediates, whereas Lys122 was not essential for this reaction (Fig. 3C). Overexpression of MAP1LC3B Increases the MAP1LC3B-PL Conjugate, and the Conjugate Fractionates into the Pellet—We have shown that, in HeLa cells, endogenous MAP1LC3B-PL is a lipidated form of endogenous MAP1LC3B (12Tanida I. Sou Y.-S. Ezaki J. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36268-36276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and the lipidated protein fractionated into the 100,000 × g pellet (Fig. 4A) (11Tanida I. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Tanida I. Sou Y.-S. Ezaki J. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36268-36276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). If recombinant MAP1LC3B is lipidated by a ubiquitylation-like reaction after its carboxyl-terminal cleavage, overexpression of MAP1LC3B would result in increases in the lipidated and cytosolic forms of MAP1LC3B. We therefore investigated whether the mobility of recombinant MAP1LC3B-PL is similar to that of endogenous MAP1LC3B-PL on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. When we expressed untagged MAP1LC3B under the control of the elongation factor 1α promoter in HeLa cells, recombinant and endogenous proteins showed similar mobility (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 3 versus lanes 2 and 4). After subcellular fractionation by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, a band corresponding to MAP1LC3B-PL was observed in the pellet (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that recombinant MAP1LC3B-PL is a lipidated form, similar to the endogenous protein, and that this band does not represent a degradation product of MAP1LC3B, findings in agreement with our previous observations (10Tanida I.

Similar results were observed when MAP1LC3B-TFG and MAP1LC3BK122A were expressed in HeLa cells (data not shown). We have shown that FLAG-MAP1LC3B, in which MAP1LC3B was fused to the FLAG epitope at its amino terminus, is recognized as two bands in HEK293 cells (11Tanida I. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Tanida I. Nishitani T. Nemoto T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and that a lipidated form of FLAG-MAP1LC3B (FLAG-MAP1LC3B-PL) is fractionated into the pellet in HEK293 cells (11Tanida I. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To remove the possibility that the lipidation of FLAG-MAP1LC3B is specific to HEK293 cells, we investigated whether FLAG-MAP1LC3B-PL is fractionated into the pellet in HeLa cells. When FLAG-MAP1LC3B was expressed in HeLa cells, FLAG-MAP1LC3B-PL showed faster mobility compared with the unmodified forms and was fractionated into the pellet in a manner similar to that of the endogenous protein (Fig. 4C), in agreement with our previous findings in HEK293 cells (11Tanida I. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Tanida I. Nishitani T. Nemoto T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have also shown that GFP-MAP1LC3B, in which MAP1LC3B was fused to GFP at its amino terminus, forms E1- and E2-substrate intermediates with mammalian Atg7 and Atg3, respectively (10Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13739-13744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Tanida I. Nishitani T. Nemoto T. Ueno T. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether GFP-MAP1LC3B would be recognized as two bands (cytosolic GFP-MAP1LC3B and membrane-bound GFP-MAP1LC3B-PL) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel or whether GFP-MAP1LC3B-PL is fractionated into the pellet. When GFP-MAP1LC3B was expressed in HeLa cells and probed with anti-GFP antibody, two bands were observed (Fig. 4D). These bands were of closer mobility than the two bands observed with FLAG-MAP1LC3B because the GFP tag is larger than the FLAG tag. Subcellular fractionation indicated that GFP-MAP1LC3B-PL was in the pellet, along with the lipidated forms of the endogenous and other recombinant proteins (Fig. 4D, Sup and Ppt). These results indicate that, like the endogenous protein, recombinant MAP1LC3B is lipidated in vivo. RNA Interference of hLC3/MAP1LC3B Inhibits Expression of Endogenous LC3 in HEK293 Cells—Endogenous MAP1LC3B and MAP1LC3B-PL were recognized by immunoblotting with anti-MAP1LC3B antibody. However, this antibody may show significant cross-reaction with MAP1LC3A or MAP1LC3C. To determine whether this is the case, we used a vector expressing MAP1LC3B-specific short hairpin RNA under the control of a human H1 promoter (pSi-hLC3) to interfere with MAP1LC3B mRNA. In the presence of this hairpin, bands recognized by anti-MAP1LC3B antibody and corresponding to endogenous MAP1LC3B and MAP1LC3B-PL will be simultaneously decreased. Furthermore, the employed hairpin sequence shows little identity to the DNA sequences of MAP1LC3A and MAP1LC3C, and a BLAST search found no other identical sequences. When we transfected HEK293 cells with pSi-hLC3, cultured the cells for 48 h, and immunoblotted the total cell lysates with anti-MAP1LC3B antibody, we found that the quantities of both endogenous MAP1LC3B and MAP1LC3B-PL were significantly decreased compared with control cells (Fig. 5). Since RNA interference specifically inhibits mRNA containing 100% identical sequence, these results indicate that endogenous MAP1LC3B-PL and MAP1LC3B are derived from authentic hLC3/MAP1LC3B mRNA and not from MAP1LC3A or MAP1LC3C. We have shown here that the carboxyl terminus of MAP1LC3B is cleaved in vivo and in vitro and that its Gly120 is essential for cleavage. Similarly, the carboxyl termini of MAP1LC3BK122A-3xFLAG, Myc-MAP1LC3B-His, Myc-MAP1LC3BK122A-His, and Myc-MAP1LC3BK122R-His are also cleaved. In contrast to He et al. (13He H. Dang Y. Dai F. Guo Z.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29278-29287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), who reported that Myc-MAP1LC3B-His protein is modified at Lys122 without any carboxyl-terminal cleavage, we have shown here that Gly120 of MAP1LC3B is essential for the cleavage of Myc-MAP1LC3B-His as well as MAP1LC3B-3xFLAG. Following cleavage, both the cytosolic and lipidated forms of Myc-MAP1LC3B-His were recognized as two bands by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody, but not with anti-His antibody. Both Myc-MAP1LC3B-His and Myc-MAP1LC3BK122A-His formed E1- and E2-substrate intermediates with hAtg7C572S and hAtg3C264S, respectively, as previously shown for untagged MAP1LC3B, FLAG-MAP1LC3B, and GFP-MAP1LC3B (Fig. 3 and Ref. 10Tanida I.

RNA interference of MAP1LC3B mRNA showed that anti-MAP1LC3B antibody recognized endogenous MAP1LC3B, but not MAP1LC3A and MAP1LC3C. In addition, this antibody recognized endogenous MAP1LC3B as two bands corresponding to the cytosolic and membrane-bound forms and recognized the endogenous lipidated form of MAP1LC3B in 19 other human cell lines. 2I. Tanida, T. Ueno, and E. Kominami, unpublished data. These results demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of Myc-MAP1LC3B-His is cleaved to expose Gly120 for further lipidation in a manner similar to that observed with endogenous MAP1LC3B. Considering the biochemical properties of MAP1LC3B, hAtg4B (a cysteine protease that cleaves MAP1LC3B at its carboxyl terminus, exposing Gly120), hAtg7 (an E1-like enzyme for MAP1LC3B), and hAtg3 (an E2-like enzyme for MAP1LC3B) shown here and previously (9Tanida I.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1165-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), it is reasonable that the carboxyl-terminal cleavage of recombinant MAP1LC3B, even Myc-MAP1LC3B-His, occurs prior to ubiquitylation-like modification in a manner similar to that shown for endogenous MAP1LC3B. Mutants MAP1LC3B-TFG and MAP1LC3BK122A and wild-type MAP1LC3B can form E1- and E2-substrate intermediates with hAtg7C572S and hAtg3C264S, respectively, whereas mutant MAP1LC3B-TF cannot, suggesting that MAP1LC3B is cleaved at Met121 to expose Gly120. We obtained similar results using a series of Myc-MAP1LC3B-His proteins. Since Gly120 is exposed after carboxyl-terminal cleavage, it is not likely that Lys122 contributes to the E1 and E2 reactions because, in vivo, little of the remaining cytosolic MAP1LC3B would contain carboxyl-terminal residues 121–125 (MKLSV). When wild-type MAP1LC3B was overexpressed in HeLa cells, the mobility of recombinant MAP1LC3B and MAP1LC3B-PL was similar to that of the endogenous proteins, and recombinant MAP1LC3B-PL proteins were fractionated into the pellet. These findings indicate that the carboxyl terminus of MAP1LC3B is cleaved to expose Gly120 and that this residue, and not Lys122, is essential for further ubiquitylation-like modifications mediated by hAtg7 and hAtg3. Finally, MAP1LC3B is modified to MAP1LC3B-PL, i.e. hLC3/MAP1LC3B is an authentic modifier, as is rat LC3. Therefore, even if Lys122 of MAP1LC3B is modified prior to carboxyl-terminal cleavage, it could not contribute to the modifier function of MAP1LC3B or to its activity as a promising autophagosomal marker.

https://openalex.org/W1968963416,"Cyclooxygenases (COXs) catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to eicosanoids, which mediate a variety of biological actions involved in vascular pathophysiology. In the present study, we investigated the role of lipid peroxidation products in the up-regulation of COX-2, an inducible isoform responsible for high levels of prostaglandin production during inflammation and immune responses. COX-2 was found to colocalize with 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a major lipid peroxidation-derived aldehyde, in foamy macrophages within human atheromatous lesions, suggesting that COX-2 expression may be associated with the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products within macrophages. To test the hypothesis that lipid peroxidation products might be involved in the regulation of prostanoid biosynthesis, we conducted a screen of oxidized fatty acid metabolites and found that, among the compounds tested, only HNE showed inducibility of the COX-2 protein in RAW264.7 macrophages. In addition, intraperitoneal administration of HNE resulted in an increase in cell numbers in the peritoneal cavity that was associated with significant increases in the peritoneal and tissue levels of COX-2 in mice. To understand the possible signaling mechanism underlying the inducing effect of HNE on COX-2 up-regulation, we examined the phosphorylation events that may lead to COX-2 induction and found that HNE did not stimulate the induction of nitric oxide synthase and activation of NF-κB but significantly activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and its upstream kinase in RAW264.7 macrophages. Tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor-like and Src family tyrosine kinases, appeared to mediate the stabilization of COX-2 mRNA via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These findings suggest that HNE accumulated in macrophages/foam cells may represent an inflammatory mediator that plays a role in stimulation of the inflammatory response and contributes to the progression of atherogenesis. Cyclooxygenases (COXs) catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to eicosanoids, which mediate a variety of biological actions involved in vascular pathophysiology. In the present study, we investigated the role of lipid peroxidation products in the up-regulation of COX-2, an inducible isoform responsible for high levels of prostaglandin production during inflammation and immune responses. COX-2 was found to colocalize with 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a major lipid peroxidation-derived aldehyde, in foamy macrophages within human atheromatous lesions, suggesting that COX-2 expression may be associated with the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products within macrophages. To test the hypothesis that lipid peroxidation products might be involved in the regulation of prostanoid biosynthesis, we conducted a screen of oxidized fatty acid metabolites and found that, among the compounds tested, only HNE showed inducibility of the COX-2 protein in RAW264.7 macrophages. In addition, intraperitoneal administration of HNE resulted in an increase in cell numbers in the peritoneal cavity that was associated with significant increases in the peritoneal and tissue levels of COX-2 in mice. To understand the possible signaling mechanism underlying the inducing effect of HNE on COX-2 up-regulation, we examined the phosphorylation events that may lead to COX-2 induction and found that HNE did not stimulate the induction of nitric oxide synthase and activation of NF-κB but significantly activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and its upstream kinase in RAW264.7 macrophages. Tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor-like and Src family tyrosine kinases, appeared to mediate the stabilization of COX-2 mRNA via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These findings suggest that HNE accumulated in macrophages/foam cells may represent an inflammatory mediator that plays a role in stimulation of the inflammatory response and contributes to the progression of atherogenesis. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of lipid metabolism as well as a chronic inflammatory disease. Monocyte-derived macrophages play a prominent role in the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaque, particularly after their transformation into foam cells. When activated by inflammatory stimuli, the macrophages synthesize and secrete various mediators, including cytokines, prothrombotic substances, and eicosanoids that cause the clinical manifestations and acute clinical complications of atherosclerosis. The eicosanoids derived from the metabolism of arachidonate have been extensively investigated because several studies have focused on their close relation to atherogenesis (1FitzGerald G.A. Austin S. Egan K. Cheng Y. Pratico D. Ann. Med. 2000; 32: 21-26PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Topper J.N. Nagel T. Anderson K.R. Garcia-Cardena G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In macrophages, as well as in other cell types, arachidonate metabolites are synthesized by the cyclooxygenase enzyme. Presently, two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitor-κB; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HNE, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; EGFR, EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase. which is the constitutive form, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is the inducible form. COX-1, with an mRNA transcript of 2.8–3.0 kb, is present under normal conditions in most tissues and is responsible for housekeeping functions. On the other hand, COX-2, with an mRNA transcript of 4.0–4.5 kb, is not normally present under basal conditions or is present in very low amounts. However, COX-2 is rapidly induced by various stimuli, including proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, growth factors, and tumor promoters, to result in prostaglandin synthesis associated with inflammation and carcinogenesis (3FitzGerald G.A. Nat. Rev. 2003; 2: 879-890Google Scholar). In macrophages, COX-2 expression appears to be mediated through both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways (4Hwang D. Jang B.C. Yu G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the oxidative modification of protein and the subsequent accumulation of the modified proteins have been found in cells during aging, oxidative stress, and in various pathological states including premature diseases, muscular dystrophy, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis (5Shacter E. Drug. Metab. Rev. 2000; 32: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 6Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The important agents that give rise to the modification of a protein may be represented by reactive aldehydic intermediates such as ketoaldehydes, 2-alkenals, and 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals (7Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). These reactive aldehydes are considered important mediators of cell damage because of their ability to covalently modify biomolecules that can disrupt important cellular functions and can cause mutations (8Esterbauer H. Schauer R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar, 9Uchida K. Prog. Lipid. Res. 2003; 42: 318-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the adduction of aldehydes to apolipoprotein B in low density lipoproteins (LDL) has been strongly implicated in the mechanism by which LDL is converted to an atherogenic form that is taken up by macrophages, leading to the formation of foam cells (10Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Steinberg D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 369: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), among the reactive aldehydes, is a major product of lipid peroxidation and is believed to be largely responsible for the cytopathological effects observed during oxidative stress (8Esterbauer H. Schauer R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar, 9Uchida K. Prog. Lipid. Res. 2003; 42: 318-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Atherogenesis involves several aspects of chronic inflammation and wound healing. Indeed, the atheroma is considered a special case of tissue response to injury. Injurious stimuli may include lipoproteins trapped within lesions where protein and lipid moieties have undergone oxidative modifications. In a recent study, oxidized LDL components were shown to activate CD36, an important scavenger receptor, mediating the uptake of oxidized LDL (12Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38503-38516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 13Ishii T. Itoh K. Ruiz E. Leake D.S. Unoki H. Yamamoto M. Mann G.E. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that oxidized LDL contains a pro-atherogenic molecule that plays a role in foam cell formation and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In view of the observation that increased eicosanoid production is closely associated with atherogenesis (1FitzGerald G.A. Austin S. Egan K. Cheng Y. Pratico D. Ann. Med. 2000; 32: 21-26PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Topper J.N. Nagel T. Anderson K.R. Garcia-Cardena G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that an oxidized LDL component might be involved in the up-regulation of the prostaglandin biosynthesis. Even though human atherosclerotic lesions have been shown to contain a number of oxidized LDL components, we possess no information concerning their pro-inflammatory function (COX-2 inducibility) in macrophages. In the present study, we have demonstrated that COX-2 colocalizes with protein-bound HNE in macrophage-derived foam cells within atheromatous lesions. We then evaluated the effect of the oxidized fatty acid metabolites on COX-2 induction in RAW264.7 macrophages and identified HNE as the potential inducer of COX-2 expression. Moreover, the involvement of HNE in COX-2 expression is also suggested by our demonstrations that COX-2 is up-regulated in mice administered with HNE. Finally, a signal transduction mechanism involved in the COX-2 expression stimulated by HNE is shown. Materials—HNE was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). 4-Oxo-2-nonenal was synthesized by the oxidation of HNE-dimethyl acetal with pyridinium dichlorochromate followed by HCl hydrolysis (14De Montarby L. Mosset P. Gree R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 3895Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Anti-COX-1 monoclonal and anti-COX-2 polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) and anti-MKK3/MKK6 (Ser-189/207) phospho-specific antibodies were purchased from New England Labs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 was from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin, Na3VO4, PP2, and AG1478 were purchased from Calbiochem. First-strand cDNA synthesis kit was from Invitrogen. Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-goat IgG was from DAKO Corp. Anti-rabbit IgG immunoglobulin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection reagents, and Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay reagent obtained from Pierce. Cell Culture—The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was kindly given by Dr. Murakami (Kinki University, Japan). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (588 μg/ml), and 0.16% NaHCO3 at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. 50–60% confluent cells were subjected to experiments in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Immunoblot Analysis—The HNE-treated and untreated cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After protein quantification, equal amounts of protein were (total protein, 20–50 μg) boiled with Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min at 100 °C (15Laemmuli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The samples were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with 5% skim milk in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline containing 10% Tween 20) for blocking, washed, and treated with the primary antibodies. After washing with TTBS, blots were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase in TTBS. Blots were then washed three times in TTBS before visualization. An ECL kit was used for detection. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated with ISOGEN reagent (Nippon Gene Co., Tokyo, Japan). The RNA concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. The RT reaction was performed with 5 μg of total RNA and an oligo(dT) primer using the First-strand cDNA synthesis kit. PCR reactions were carried out using 0.5 μl of cDNA in 25 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μm dNTPs, 1 μm of each forward and reverse primer, and 2 units of rTaq DNA polymerase (Toyobo Co., Osaka, Japan). The amplification conditions were: COX-2, 94 °C for 15 s (denaturation), 54 °C for 15 s (annealing), and 72 °C for 30 s (extension) for 26 cycles; GAPDH, 94 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 25 cycles, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. The following primers were used: COX-2, (F) 5′-CCCTGCTGGTGGAAAAGCCTGGTCC-3′ and (R) 5′-TACTGTAGGGTTAATGTCATCTAG-3′; GAPDH, (F) 5′-AACCCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGC-3′ and (R) 5′-CACAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCAGTGAT-3′. RNA Stability Assay—RAW264.7 cells were treated with HNE for 2 h to induce COX-2 mRNA expression. The medium was then changed to fresh medium containing actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) with or without an inhibitor reagent. At different time intervals, cells were collected for RNA preparation. RNA was examined by RT-PCR analysis. The levels of COX-2 mRNA were normalized for the intensity of the GAPDH signals. Animal Experiments—Male C57BL/6J mice (Japan SLC Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan) were obtained at 7 weeks of age and individually housed in plastic cages (five/cage) at 23 °C with a 12-h light cycle. For 12 days they were fed unrestricted amounts of water and the control diet as follows: 20% casein, 3.5% mineral (93G-MX), 5.0% vitamin (93-VX), 0.2% choline chloride, 5.0% corn oil, 4.0% cellulose powder, 22.1% sucrose, and 44.2% starch. Animals received a single intraperitoneal injection of 10 μmol HNE (200 μl of PBS). Control animals received an equal volume of PBS. They were sacrificed by decapitation at 0, 6, and 24 h after the administration. Following sacrifice, the mice were injected with 4 ml of cold saline. The peritoneal cavity was gently massaged and the lavage fluid withdrawn and pooled. This procedure was repeated three times. Following washes with Hanks' balanced salt solutions, peritoneal cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After the incubation, nonadherent cells were removed by washing three times with Hank's Balanced Salt Solutions, and adherent cells were recovered with trypsin treatment and counted. For immunohistochemical analysis of COX-2, tissues from the control and HNE-treated animals were immediately removed, fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin, cut to 3-μm thickness, and used for immunohistochemical analyses by an avidin-biotin complex method with alkaline phosphatase. Briefly, after deparaffinization with xylene and ethanol, anti-COX-2 polyclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml), biotin-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:300; Vector Laboratories), and avidin-biotin complex (diluted 1:100; Vector) were sequentially used. Procedures using PBS or the IgG fraction (0.5 μg/ml) of normal rabbit serum instead of anti-COX-2 polyclonal antibody showed no or negligible positive responses. Immunohistochemical Detection of COX-2 and Protein-bound HNE in Human Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery—Coronary artery specimens were obtained at routine autopsy procedures from patients with atherosclerosis and used for histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. Each autopsy was performed at Nihon University Itabashi Hospital after family members granted informed consent in accordance with the Ethical Guidelines of Human Materials at Nihon University School of Medicine. Tissue samples from each case were fixed in 20% formalin, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and stored at room temperature. Serial 4-μm thick sections were cut from paraffin materials and used for hematoxylin-eosin staining or immunohistochemical staining. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the sections were quenched for 15 min with 3% hydrogen peroxide, rinsed in PBS, and boiled for 10 min in 100 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for antigen retrieval. The tissues were pretreated with 5% cow powder milk in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with a mouse monoclonal anti-CD68 antibody (KP-1; DAKO) at a dilution of 1:200, goat polyclonal anti-COX-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:200, or the mouse monoclonal anti-HNE-histidine antibody (RS17) at a dilution of 0.1 μg/ml. Antibody binding was visualized using the Histo-Fine SimpleStain kits (Nichirei Corp.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride was used as the chromogen, and hematoxylin was used as the counterstain. Sections from which the primary antibodies were omitted served as negative reaction controls. The localizations of HNE and COX-2 immunoreactivities were verified by consecutive sections stained with hematoxylineosin and immunostained for CD68. Colocalization of COX-2 with Protein-bound HNE in Human Atherosclerotic Lesions—To obtain evidence for the involvement of lipid peroxidation products in COX-2 overproduction in vivo, we examined the pathohistologic location of COX-2 and a representative lipid peroxidation product, HNE, in human atherosclerotic coronary arterial samples. The non-atherosclerotic arterial wall had little or no COX-2 and HNE (data not shown), whereas in and around the advanced atherosclerotic core region both COX-2 and protein-bound HNE localized in the cytoplasm of foamy macrophages (Fig. 1, A and B). These macrophages were identified by histopathological and immunohistochemical features on hematoxylin-eosin-stained (data not shown) or CD68-immunostained (panel C) sections. It was also found that both COX-2 and HNE colocalized with other blood vessel cell types, but the brightest signals were shown in macrophage-derived foam cells. No immunoreaction product deposits were detected in sections with omission of the primary antibodies (panel D). These data suggest that COX-2 expression may be associated with the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products within macrophages. Identification of HNE as a Specific COX-2 Inducer—To test whether lipid peroxidation products might be involved in regulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis, we conducted a screen of oxidized fatty acid metabolites. RAW264.7 macrophages were treated for 6 h with 50 μm of the indicated compounds, and COX-2 induction was examined by an immunoblot analysis. Remarkably, among the oxidized lipids tested only HNE showed inducibility of the COX-2 protein (Fig. 2). Of interest, 4-oxo-2-nonenal, an analog of HNE, did not show any effect on COX-2 induction. These results and the observation that COX-2 colocalized with HNE in human atherosclerotic lesions (Fig. 1) suggest that HNE might be involved in COX-2 induction in macrophages. HNE Induces COX-2 Expression in RAW264.7 Macrophages—We then examined HNE (Fig. 3A) for an effect on COX-2 expression. When the cells were treated with 50 μm HNE, almost maximal increases in COX-2 protein levels in response to HNE treatment were observed by 6 h, whereas the amount of the COX-1 was essentially unchanged (Fig. 3B). Dose-dependent effects of HNE were also analyzed at the time of maximum induction (6 h), and the COX-2 protein was induced in the concentration range of 5–75 μm (Fig. 3C). Transcriptional regulation of COX activities was further demonstrated using RT-PCR. As illustrated in Fig. 3D, the effect of HNE on the COX-2 protein was correlated with increasing levels of COX-2 mRNA. The increase in the COX-2 message, therefore, coincided with a substantial rise in the COX-2 protein level. It has also been shown that oxidized LDL components, including HNE, could activate CD36, an important scavenger receptor, mediating the uptake of oxidized LDL (13Ishii T. Itoh K. Ruiz E. Leake D.S. Unoki H. Yamamoto M. Mann G.E. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, HNE-induced COX-2 expression was functionally associated with the expression of other inflammation-related regulatory molecules, such as CD36 (Supplementary Fig. S1). These data suggest that HNE may represent an inflammatory mediator that is capable of directly inducing several pro-atherogenic molecules in macrophages. COX-2 Up-regulation in Mice Administered with HNE—To further examine whether HNE is capable of inducing COX-2 expression in vivo, mice were challenged intraperitoneal with 10 μmol HNE for 48 h, and changes in cell numbers and COX-2 levels in the peritoneal cavity were measured. As shown in Fig. 4A, left panel, the HNE-treated mice showed a 2.7-fold increase in cell numbers in the peritoneal cavity. This increase was because of HNE, as saline challenge (Control) did not induce a cellular infiltrate. This HNE-induced cellular infiltrate was associated with the increased expression of COX-2 in peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 4A, right panel). Moreover, we examined COX-2 levels in the tissues (liver, lung, kidney, and spleen) from mice challenged with HNE and found that COX-2 was significantly induced by HNE treatment in these tissues (Fig. 4B). An immunohistochemistry experiment also verified the induction of COX-2 in the tissues from mice treated with HNE (Fig. 4C). HNE Stimulated COX-2 Induction through an NF-κB-independent Mechanism—It has been shown that nitric oxide (NO) may increase prostaglandin synthesis by activation of the COX-2 protein (16Franchi A.M. Chaud M. Rettori V. Suburo A. McCann S.M. Gimeno M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Salvemini D. Misko T.P. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K.

NO is known to react with iron-containing enzymes, resulting in their activation; in this respect, the heme-containing COX-2 enzyme is a potential target for the direct action of NO. Conversely, production of prostaglandin has been reported to increase or decrease NO production in a biphasic manner in murine macrophages and mesangial cells (21Milano S. Arcoleo F. Dieli M.D. Agostino R.D. Agostino P. De Nucci G. Cillari E. Prostaglandins. 1995; 49: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Tetsuka T. Daphna-Iken D. Srivastava S.K. Baier L.D. DuMaine J. Morrison A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12168-12172Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, LPS significantly induced both COX-2 and iNOS in RAW264.7 cells, whereas HNE-induced COX-2 expression was not associated with iNOS induction. The observation that HNE-induced up-regulation of COX-2 was not associated with iNOS induction contradicts previous findings that NF-κB, a ubiquitous transcription factor, regulates gene expression of both COX-2 and iNOS (23Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Heiss E. Herhaus C. Klimo K. Bartsch H. Gerhauser C. J. Biol.

Ther. 2003; 305: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Hence, to ascertain whether NF-κB is involved in HNE-induced COX-2 expression, we examined NF-κB activation in RAW264.7 macrophages treated with HNE. As shown in Fig. 5, B–E, LPS induced transient reduction of the inhibitor-κB (IκB) level (panel B) and significantly enhanced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (panel C), whereas no significant change in IκB and NF-κB levels was observed in the HNE-stimulated cells (D and E). Thus, it appears that HNE up-regulates COX-2 expression through an NF-κB-independent mechanism. Involvement of Tyrosine Kinases in HNE-induced COX-2 Ex pression—To understand the possible signaling mechanism underlying the inducing effect of HNE on COX-2 up-regulation, we examined the phosphorylation events that may lead to COX-2 induction. Involvement of tyrosine kinases was suggested by the observations that a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin, significantly inhibited COX-2 induction (Fig. 6A), whereas sodium orthovanadate, a general inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase, conversely potentiated it (Fig. 6B). To further investigate whether HNE can activate cellular protein kinases, the cells incubated with 50 μm HNE and the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins were determined by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 7A, several proteins with apparent molecular masses of 60, 80, and 120 kDa were the dominant proteins phosphorylated after incubation with HNE. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable within 5 min during HNE treatment and up to at least 2 h after the treatment. In addition, HNE-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by PP2 and AG1478, the pharmacological inhibitors of the Src family and EGFR-like tyrosine kinases, respectively (Fig. 7, B and C). Therefore, the early increase in tyrosine phosphorylation led us to hypothesize that the activation of protein tyrosine kinases is probably one of the upstream signals of HNE-stimulated COX-2 induction in cells. In agreement with this hypothesis, the inhibitors of the Src family and EGFR-like tyrosine kinases significantly suppressed HNE-induced COX-2 expression (Fig. 7D). Thus, it is likely that multiple protein kinases may be involved in the induction of COX-2 by HNE. Involvement of Tyrosine Kinases in p38 MAPK-mediated Stabilization of COX-2 mRNA—It has been shown that p38 MAPK plays a pivotal role in COX-2 induction (4Hwang D. Jang B.C. Yu G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously shown that HNE stimulates the p38 MAPK pathway in rat liver epithelial RL34 cells (26Kumagai T. Nakamura Y. Osawa T. Uchida K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined the involvement of tyrosine kinases in HNE-induced COX-2 expression through the p38 MAPK pathway. As shown in Fig. 8A, after stimulation with 50 μm HNE, p38 MAPK was rapidly and strongly phosphorylated within 5 min, and this phosphorylation was maintained after 60 min. MKK3/MKK6, which is an upstream kinase of p38 MAPK, was also phosphorylated by HNE treatment, and this phosphorylation was correlated with the p38 MAPK phosphorylation. HNE also activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; however, a MAPK pathway, consisting of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinases 1/2, was not phosphorylated by the HNE treatment (data not shown). The involvement of a p38 MAPK pathway in the HNE-induced COX-2 expression was suggested by the observation that SB203580, a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor, significantly suppressed HNE-induced COX-2 expression (Fig. 8B). To establish the possible connection between tyrosine kinases and MAPK, the effect of pharmacological inhibitors of the Src family and EGFR-like tyrosine kinases upon HNE-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was examined. As shown in Fig. 8C, both tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP2 and AG1478 significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. The result suggests that HNE activates the p38 MAPK cascades via the Src family and EGFR-like tyrosine kinases. Because p38 MAPK modulates COX-2 mRNA levels by a change in mRNA stability (27Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. Mc"
https://openalex.org/W2142337877,"The DNA array technique allows comprehensive analysis of the genome and transcriptome, but the high throughput array-based assessment of intracellular signal transduction remains troublesome. The goal of this study was to test a new peptide array technology for studying the activity of all kinases of whole cell lysates, the kinome. Cell lysates from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide were used for in vitro phosphorylation with [γ-33P]ATP arrays consisting of 192 peptides (substrates for kinases) spotted on glass. The usefulness of peptide arrays for studying signal transduction was demonstrated by the generation of the first comprehensive description of the temporal kinetics of phosphorylation events induced by lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Furthermore analysis of the signals obtained suggested activation of p21Ras by lipopolysaccharide, and this was confirmed by direct measurement of p21Ras GTP levels in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which represents the first direct demonstration of p21Ras activation by stimulation of a Toll receptor family member. Further confidence in the usefulness of peptide array technology for studying signal transduction came from Western blot analysis of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells, which corroborated the signals obtained using peptide arrays as well as from the demonstration that kinase inhibitors effected peptide array phosphorylation patterns consistent with the expected action of these inhibitors. We conclude that this first metabolic array is a useful method to determine the enzymatic activities of a large group of kinases, offering high throughput analysis of cellular metabolism and signal transduction. The DNA array technique allows comprehensive analysis of the genome and transcriptome, but the high throughput array-based assessment of intracellular signal transduction remains troublesome. The goal of this study was to test a new peptide array technology for studying the activity of all kinases of whole cell lysates, the kinome.

Massive parallel analysis using array technology has become the mainstay for the analysis of genomes and transcriptomes (1Eisen M.B. Brown P.O.

Novel insights have led to the notion that the majority of the transcriptome is necessary to keep a cell functioning and could be regarded as the minimal transcriptome. Only a small portion of the transcripts present in the cell determines the identity of the cell, and these critical transcripts are expressed at low levels. Therefore small changes in the expression profiles in the transcriptome can lead to large changes in enzymatic profile of the cell leading to significant differences in cell functioning (6Irish J.M.

Thus, a comprehensive description of cellular metabolism may be more useful than such a description of the genome and transcriptome. Array technology has not yet been adapted to measure enzymatic activity in whole cell lysates, but progress has been made with the preparation of protein chips for the assessment of protein substrate interactions (7Lueking A.

Trends Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 279-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed that employing peptide chips, prepared by the Diels-Alder-mediated immobilization of one kinase substrate (for the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src) on a monolayer of alkanethiolates on gold, allows quantitative evaluation of kinase activity. Hence, in principle an array exhibiting specific consensus sequences for protein kinases across the entire kinome (the combined activity of all cellular kinases) would allow a more comprehensive detection of signal transduction events in whole cell lysates. Obviously, employing this kind of array technology for this purpose would allow faster and more inclusive analysis of cellular metabolism in comparison to currently available technology, which focuses on the static determination of the relative concentration of metabolites but does not address the actual activity of various cellular signaling pathways. The above-mentioned considerations prompted us to test the usefulness of peptide arrays containing spatially addressed mammalian kinase substrates for studying the kinome in a cellular context. We show that such peptide arrays allow us to make a comprehensive description of the phosphorylation events induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PKA, protein kinase A; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; MAP, mitogen-activated protein.1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PKA, protein kinase A; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, analysis of the results revealed a role of p21Ras in LPS signal transduction, and this finding was confirmed by a pull-down assay. Thus the peptide array technology enabled us to identify the first example of p21Ras activation by a member of the toll receptor family. Chemicals—The catalytic subunit of protein kinase A was purchased from Promega (V5161). Single Kinase Analysis on Peptide Array—50 μl of the protein kinase A (PKA) incubation mix (500 ng/ml PKA catalytic subunit, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 μm [γ-33P]ATP, 0.01% (v/v) Brij-35, 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 33P]ATP (1000 kBq)) was added to the glass slide and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min in a humidified oven. After incubation the glass slide is washed twice in 2 m NaCl, twice in demineralized H2O, and air-dried. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Isolation—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers using standard density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences AB), followed by washing and resuspension in IMDM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin (hereafter referred to as complete IMDM). Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot samples, 106 PBMCs were suspended in 1 ml of complete IMDM, and LPS stimulations were 15-min incubations (37 °C, 5% CO2) with 100 ng/ml LPS, Escherichia coli, serotype 0111:B4. Stimulations were terminated by an ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline wash. Cells were subsequently pelleted, lysed, denatured (5 min at 95 °C), and stored at –20 °C. 106 PBMCs lysed in 200 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8 at 25 °C), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue), 25 μl of which was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Phosphospecific antibodies for immunoblotting were from Cell Signaling and included phospho-p38 MAP kinase (catalog number 9211), phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (catalog number 9101), phospho-PKCζ/λ (catalog number 9378), phospho-MEK1/2 (catalog number 9121), phospho-Raf (catalog number 9424), phospho-Akt (catalog number 9271), and phospho-SAPK/JNK (catalog number 9255). Non-phosphospecific actin (sc-1616) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All antibodies were used in accordance with the supplier's protocol, and images were revealed with a Lumi-Imager (Roche Applied Science) using the chemoluminescence substrate Lumilight+ (Roche Applied Science). Peptide Array Analysis—For kinome array samples, 107 PBMCs were suspended in 5 ml of complete IMDM. Stimulations were terminated by an ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline wash. PBMCs were lysed in 200 ml of cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF) and the volume of the cell lysate was equalized with distilled H2O. The cell lysates were subsequently cleared on a 0.22-μm filter. Peptide array incubation mix was produced by adding 10 μl of filter-cleared activation mix (50% glycerol, 50 μm [γ-33P]ATP, 0.05% v/v Brij-35, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, [γ-33P]ATP (1000 kBq)). Next, the peptide array mix was added onto the chip, and the chip was kept at 37 °C in a humidified stove for 90 min. Subsequently the peptide array was washed twice with Tris-buffered saline with Tween, twice in 2 m NaCl, and twice in demineralized H2O and then air-dried. The experiments were performed three times in duplicate. Analysis of Peptide Array—The chips were exposed to a phosphorimager plate for 72 h, and the density of the spots was measured and analyzed with array software. Ras Activation Assay—The Ras Activation Assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid NY) was used following the supplier's instructions. Determination of protein concentration required by the Ras Activation Assay kit was made with the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce) according to the supplier's instructions. Peptide Array Design and Construction—In silico analysis of the Phosphobase resource enabled identification of consensus amino acid phosphorylation sequences for most kinases present in mammalian genome (15Blom N. Kreegipuu A. Brunak S. Conway T. Schoolnik G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Further analysis of this set of kinase substrates revealed that the mean amino acid residue length that achieves an optimal specificity/sensitivity ratio for substrate phosphorylation was nine amino acids, and thus for building an array nonapeptides were employed. Arrays were constructed by chemically synthesizing soluble pseudo-peptides, which were covalently coupled to glass substrates (extensively described in the supplemental data). This array consisted of 192 peptides (denominated A1–P12), providing kinase substrate consensus sequences across the mammalian kinome (see Table I). To allow assessment of possible intra-experimental variability in substrate phosphorylation, on each separate carrier the array was spotted two times using a biorobotics microgrid spotter equipped with 100 micron split pins. Peptides were spotted onto and subsequently covalently coupled to branched hydrogel polymer-coated glass slides (supplemental data). Spotted slides were stored at 4 °C. The final physical dimensions of the array were 19.5 × 19.5 mm with each peptide spot having a diameter of ∼350 μm and peptide spots being 750 μm apart.Table ISequences of substrate peptides and their location on the peptide array All sequences are derived from the Phosphobase resource (phospho.elm.eu.org). The mean amino acid residue length that achieves an optimal specificity/sensitivity ratio for substrate phosphorylation is nine amino acids. The array consists of 192 peptides, denominated A1-P12, of which 8 are controls (rhodamine-labeled irrelevant peptides for quality control of the spotting process). On each carrier these 192 peptides were spotted twice. Open table in a new tab Single Kinase Analysis—If the design of our peptide array was appropriate, addition of a purified kinase in the presence of ATP should result in the phosphorylation of the appropriate consensus peptide sequences without concomitant phosphorylation of other peptides. To test the extent to which this actually occurs, arrays were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C with 25 ng of the constitutively active catalytic subunit of PKA and [γ-33P]. This treatment should result in the phosphorylation of target peptides with 33P, allowing detection using phosphorimaging. As depicted in Fig. 1, this procedure resulted in strong phosphorylation of several peptides on the array. Analysis of the peptide sequence led to the extraction of the known most optimal PKA consensus sequence (17Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas accompanying phosphorylation of peptides not containing PKA consensus phosphorylation sites was negligible (Fig. 1). Incubation of the array with PKA and [α-33P]ATP did not lead to a detectable signal on the array (data not shown), demonstrating that spot phosphorylation was a specific binding of the γ-phosphate of ATP to the nonapeptides. These results identified the array as useful tool to determine substrate specificity of kinases. Kinome Profiling of Unstimulated Human PBMCs—Next we sought to determine whether this array is also useful for kinome profiling of actual whole cell lysates. Of the oligopeptides that were phosphorylated by lysates of unstimulated human PBMCs, a significant fraction was derived from consensus sites for cytoskeletal component-derived peptides (e.g. vimentin lamin D and lamin B receptor) (Fig. 2, Table II), which may reflect the motile phenotype of these cells (the fraction of human PBMCs consists mainly of monocytes and T-cells). In addition, peptides derived from enzymes implicated in basal cell metabolism (e.g. eIF-4F, DNA topoisomerase II, and glycogen synthase) were substrates for cell lysates of these unstimulated cells (Table II). Incubation of the array with lysates and [α-33P]ATP did not lead to a detectable signal on the array (data not shown), demonstrating that spot phosphorylation was not dependent on specific binding of ATP to peptides. Thus the kinome profile obtained from human PBMCs using in vitro phosphorylation of a peptide array is not inconsistent with the profile expected from resting mononuclear cells.Table IILPS-upregulated kinase activity Depicted are the effects the major substrate phosphorylating kinases in peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived lysates on array phosphorylation of proteins from which substrate peptide sequences are derived.

Ryan J.L. Adv. Immunol. 1979; 28: 293-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 19Weinstein S.L. Sanghera J.S. Lemke K. DeFranco A.L. Pelech S.L. J. Biol.

We considered LPS stimulation of human PBMCs an attractive model to test array-based kinome profiling. To this end, lysates of human PBMCs were treated for 15 min with vehicle or 100 ng/ml LPS and were compared with respect to their capacity to phosphorylate peptides on arrays. The LPS stimulation resulted in the specific incorporation of 33P in a variety of peptides, suggesting that the LPS treatment activated the kinases for which these peptides represent a consensus phosphorylation sequence. In this array an LPS-dependent up-regulation of phosphorylation of a variety of peptides was detected (Table II), including those with consensus phosphorylation sequences for p38 MAP kinase, p42/p44 MAP kinase, Jun-N-terminal kinase, and substrates for components of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein kinase B pathway. The validity of these signals was verified by Western blot analysis of PBMCs and subsequent probing with phosphorylation-state specific antibodies to different kinases (Fig. 3). The up-regulation of the protein kinase G autophosphorylation site was unexpected, as protein kinase G has not been implicated in LPS signaling. However, blasting this substrate against the humane genome revealed that the same substrate is also present in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 9, and may thus actually be in strict accordance with the results obtained concerning MAP kinase activation. Thus peptide arraying seems a valid tool for studying LPS signal transduction. A Comprehensive Description of LPS-induced Phosphorylation Events—The possibility to study a wide range of kinases in parallel makes it possible to make a comprehensive description of the temporal characteristics of LPS-induced phosphorylation, revealing the sequential activation and deactivation of the various kinases. Hence we stimulated human PBMCs for 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min and analyzed the effects on kinase activity employing peptide arraying, and the results show different kinetics for phosphorylation of a variety of substrates (Fig. 4). Confirming the results described above, especially enhanced phosphorylation was detected for substrates of various MAP kinases, which are known to be involved in LPS-induced p44/42 MAPK (18Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Adv. Immunol. 1979; 28: 293-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 19Weinstein S.L. Sanghera J.S. Lemke K. DeFranco A.L. Pelech S.L. J. Biol.

A peptide containing the STAT-1α/β phosphorylation site incorporated more radioactivity when incubated with lysates from LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 4) because STAT-1α/β phosphorylation is a known cellular effect of LPS (21Diks S.H.

Muller M. Decker T. Immunity. 2003; 19: 793-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Also, peptides derived from NFκB proteins were also phosphorylated (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the phosphorylation of these peptides peaked in 5–15 min and came back to basal levels after 60 min of LPS stimulation, which is in agreement with the expected time course. Remarkably, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a member of the Tec kinase family, was recently reported to be involved in LPS signaling (25Kristof A.S. Marks-Konczalik J. Billings E. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33637-33644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and we found corresponding phosphorylation of peptide corresponding to its activation site. In addition, phosphorylation of peptides derived from cytoskeletal proteins became even more pronounced as in unstimulated cells (vimentin, lamin D, and lamin B1), in agreement with the effects of LPS on cell morphology and endocytosis (Fig. 4) (19Weinstein S.L. Sanghera J.S. Lemke K. DeFranco A.L. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14955-14962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Peppelenbosch M.P. DeSmedt M. ten Hove T. van Deventer S.J. Grooten J. Blood. 1999; 93: 4011-4018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of eIF-4F corresponds well to the induction of gene expression by LPS (Fig. 4). Other remarkable effects are the changes in phosphorylation of substrates derived from p450 (CYPII) and α-crystallin (Fig. 4), and results correspond well to data published earlier (27Head M.W. Hurwitz L. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gilmore W.J. Hartmann G. Piquette-Miller M. Marriott J. Kirby G.M. Hambleton J. Weinstein S.L. Lem L. DeFranco A.L. Toxicology. 2003; 184: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several peptides derived from proteins that had not been linked to LPS signal transduction as yet also display marked changes in phosphorylation; e.g. Muscarinic Receptor M2, Rhodopsin, NEU (erbB2), and Phox47. However, phosphorylation of these proteins by MAP kinases has been reported, and thus these effects may well be indirect (Fig. 4) (29Tesfaigzi J. Johnson N.F. Lechner J.F. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1996; 77: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Coxon P.Y. Rane M.J. Uriarte S. Powell D.W. Singh S. Butt W. Chen Q. McLeish K.R. Cell.

A picture emerges in which phosphorylation of various substrates is dynamically regulated as a consequence of the LPS stimulation. Effects of Kinase Inhibitors on Lysates-induced Peptide Array Phosphorylation—To determine whether the glass slide-based peptide arrays gave functional and realistic results with respect to phosphorylation, we used the MAP kinase inhibitors PD 98059 and SB 203580. Indeed these inhibitors prevented the phosphorylation of MAP kinase regulated substrates (Fig. 5) (myelin basic protein, MAPKAPK2, c-Jun), and the substrates that were regulated by MAP kinases (muscarinic receptor M2, rhodopsin, NEU (erbB2), and Phox47) were also inhibited (Fig. 5). However other substrates that are not directly phosphorylated by MAP kinases are also influenced by the inhibitors, indicating that cross-talk and/or feedback loops between different classes of kinases is possible (STAT-1α/β, α-crystallin, Tec). Analysis of the Peptide Array Results Reveals a Role for p21Ras Activation in LPS Signal Transduction—Among the most important questions in LPS signal transduction is the molecular mechanism leading to the activation of the Raf/MEK/p42/p44 MAP kinase-signaling cascade. Classically, activation of this cascade is brought about either via the p21Ras route (which is archetypical for receptor tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors) in conjunction with protein kinase C or via the sequential activation of phospholipase Cβ and protein kinase Cα/β (which are archetypical for G protein-coupled receptors). Because LPS signals via the Toll-like receptor 4 (20Diks S.H. van Deventer S.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. J. Endotoxinin Res. 2001; 7: 335-348PubMed Google Scholar), neither of both possibilities is immediately obvious. However, p21Ras has been reported to be linked to Toll/interleukin-1 receptor) domain-dependent signaling indicating that Ras might be activated upon stimulation with LPS (33Palsson E.M. Popoff M. Thelestam M. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7818-7825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Apart from activating the p42/p44 MAP kinase signaling cascade, Ras activation also leads to stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway as well as to extensive cytoskeletal remodeling. We noticed that in our results LPS induced phosphorylation of peptides that are in accordance with activation of p21Ras as judged from the increase in phosphorylation of peptides associated with the MAP kinase pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, and cytoskeletal proteins. Also other substrates consistent with the activation of p21Ras (MARCKS, Na+/K+ ATPase, Annexin-2; Fig. 6) were phosphorylated after LPS stimulation. This prompted us to look at whether p21Ras might be involved in LPS signaling. Indeed in a p21Ras activation assay we detected increased GTP-bound p21Ras. This marks the first direct identification of p21Ras activation via the stimulation of a member of the Toll-like receptor family. These data show that it is possible to use peptide array technology to characterize changes in cellular metabolism and signal transduction even in a temporal manner and find novel interactions between signaling cascades. We interpret our kinome analysis as a useful and valuable method to determine the enzymatic activities of a large group of kinases. Therefore, kinome profiling could be a realistic possibility and especially interesting as the current metabolomics effort has been hampered by the lack of techniques that allow high-throughput analysis of the flow of cellular metabolism. Current mass spectrometry techniques concentrate on the static determination of metabolite levels rather as the enzymatic activity of the biochemical process leading to these levels. In the present study we focused on kinome profiling, but one can easily imagine arrays for assaying cellular activity with respect to dephosphorylation, acylation, acetylation, ubiquitination (ubiquitinome), etc. Thus arraying for enzymatic activities may provide metabolomics with the equivalent of the DNA array analysis for genomics with respect to the possibility to quickly obtain a comprehensive description of cellular metabolism and cellular transcriptome respectively. At present kinome arraying still suffers from “teething problems.” One of the aspects that may have to be determined is the fact that phosphatases present in the lysate could influence the amount of phosphorylation; to prevent this we employed a full spectrum of inhibitors. Obviously, however, the net amount of phosphorylation in the cell critically depends on the net activity of kinases and phosphatases, and thus the results obtained may not reflect the actual phosphorylation status of substrates in the cell but rather the amount of enzymatic phosphorylating activity. In essence kinome arraying measures flow and not absolute levels of substrate phosphorylation. In principle, using pre-phosphorylated arrays, it should be possible to measure phosphatase activity as well. It may also be possible to perform experiments without phosphatase inhibitors, but until it is shown that under the in vitro conditions of array phosphorylation kinase and phosphatase activity show similar temporal characteristics, results should be interpreted with caution. Another possible concern is that less abundant kinases may be more difficult to visualize because more abundant kinase will produce stronger signals but may not be less important for the control of physiological processes. One possible way to alleviate this problem is by using relative activities for each spot. In this manner each spot has its own range, and the differences in intensity are bypassed. In this manner one looks at the fold induction instead of the amount of phosphorylation. The fact that there are more residues inside a substrate that can be phosphorylated is also solved by using relative activation levels. Also important is that this type of array needs to be updated regularly as new and more specific substrates are being discovered. Further development of this technique is now critically dependent on the generation of peptides having improved specificity for further cellular kinases as well as expansion of the array to include the entire kinome. In particular, a pressing issue is the concern that some peptides can be phosphorylated on more than one spot and that this results in over-phosphorylation of the peptide and therefore overrating the kinase activity. This may be alleviated by developing specific pseudopeptides, harboring only one phosphorylation site, and by developing peptides with increased specificity for one kinase. The problem that MAP kinases or other kinases perform a double phosphorylation can be circumvented by employing relative values in the analysis or other post hoc corrections in the analysis software. It is important to realize that no data are currently available that suggest that peptides with multiple phosphorylation sites for kinases are also phosphorylated on those two sites simultaneously; however the extent of the problem is unknown, and more research may be needed in this direction. Disregarding these limitations, however, our present study has shown that the kinome reacts dynamically to stimulation with LPS and has helped in identifying p21Ras as a novel signal transducer in LPS signaling. Thus we feel that peptide arraying for kinome-wide analysis of biologically relevant samples is a highly promising tool for studying the biochemical changes underlying cellular signal transduction.

We focused on the 5′-untranslated region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA genome, a highly conserved RNA region, which contains structural domains that regulate key steps in the viral replication cycle. Up until now, structural information only came from in vitro studies. Here, we developed chemical modification assays to test nucleotide accessibility directly in infected cells and viral particles, thus circumventing possible biases and artifacts linked to in vitro assays. The secondary structure of the 5′-untranslated region in infected cells points to the existence of the various stem-loop motifs associated to distinct functions, proposed from in vitro probing, mutagenesis, and phylogeny. However, compared with in vitro data, subtle differences were observed in the dimerization initiation site hairpin, and none of the proposed long range interactions were observed between the functional domains. Moreover, no global RNA rearrangement was observed; structural differences between infected cells and viral particles were limited to the primer binding site, which became protected against chemical modification upon tRNA3Lys annealing in virions and to the main packaging signal. In addition, our data suggested that the genomic RNA could already dimerize in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Taken together, our results provided the first analysis of the dynamic of RNA structure of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA genome during virus assembly ex vivo.

In retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; UTR, untranslated region; TAR, trans-activation region; PBS, primer binding site; DIS, dimerization initiation site; BMH, branched multiple hairpins; LDI, long distance interaction; NC, nucleocapsid; SD, splice donor. the full-length unspliced transcript is used as a pre-mRNA (for splicing and export), mRNA (for synthesis of Gag and Gag-Pol precursor proteins), and genome for packaging as an RNA dimer into infectious particles. The 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of HIV-1 RNA is the most conserved part of the genome (1Kuiken C. Foley B. Freed E. Hahn B. Marx P. McCutchan F. Mellors J. Wolinsky S. Korber B. HIV Sequence Compendium 2002. Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2002Google Scholar). It contains a number of cis-acting sequences recognized by proteins or RNAs that regulate crucial steps of the viral life cycle (2Berkhout B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The secondary structure of the 5′-UTR of HIV-1 genomic RNA has been extensively studied by biochemical, phylogenetic, and mutational approaches (2Berkhout B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Depending on the experimental conditions, the 5′-UTR of HIV-1 (B-subtype) can adopt two alternative conformations in vitro (6Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA (N.

It has been suggested that a RNA switch may precisely coordinate the functions associated to the 5′-UTR functions in time and space. Two long range interactions have been identified in the BMH conformer in vitro, a pseudoknot between the apical loop of the poly(A) hairpin and a region within the Gag open reading frame (7Damgaard C.K.

These long distance interactions can only exist in the BMH conformation, and they could regulate the equilibrium between the BMH and LDI conformers. Beside these intramolecular interactions, symmetric intermolecular interactions take place in vitro at the DIS (12Skripkin E. Paillart J.-C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Virology. 1997; 233: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, tRNA3Lys, the reverse transcription primer, is selectively encapsidated into virions and is annealed to the PBS during or after budding (17Kleiman L. Halwani R. Javanbakht H. Curr.

In vitro studies suggested that tRNA3Lys also interacts with viral sequences upstream of the PBS (19Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14349-14355Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 5′-UTR binds several viral proteins, such as Tat (22Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5501-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dingwall C. Ernberg M. Gait S. Green S. Heaphy J. Karn A. Lowe M. Skinner M. Valerio R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 2001; 75: 7252-7265Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Notably, the NC protein is a nucleic acid chaperone that activates RNA refolding events (24Rein A. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 297-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and acts, as part of the Gag precursor, as a positive trans-acting factor in genomic RNA packaging (26Berkowitz R. Fisher J. Goff S.P. Kräusslich H.-G. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. 214. Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg1996: 177-218Google Scholar). Despite an increased knowledge of in vitro RNA secondary and tertiary structures, the structure of the 5′-UTR has never been directly investigated in tissue cell culture. To test this structure and the complex rearrangements that could take place during viral assembly, we analyzed the RNA conformation directly in infected cells and in viral particles by in situ chemical probing with dimethyl sulfate (Me2SO4) and used our data to test the models derived from in vitro structural studies. The construction of HXB2NEO, which carries the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neoR) cloned into the nef region of the genome has been described elsewhere (27Dettenhofer M. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H9 cells chronically infected with HXB2NEO were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 (1 mg/ml). Progeny viruses were quantified using a micro reverse transcriptase assay, as described previously (28Moog C. Wick A. Le Ber P. Kirn A. Aubertin A.M. Antiviral Res. 1994; 24: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described in Ref. 29Paillart J.-C. Berthoux L. Ottmann M. Darlix J.-L. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8348-8354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, except that viral pellets were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (140 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS). Proteins were detected with HIV-1-positive patient serum (1:1000). Virion pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 100 μg of proteinase K/ml for 20 min at 37 °C. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, RNA pellets were washed twice with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 mm NaCl. RNA was fractionated on 0.9% agarose gels in 1× Tris-HCl/borate/EDTA buffer at 100 V for 2–3 h at 4 °C. The agarose gel was incubated at 65 °C for 30 min in 10% formaldehyde, and samples were transferred for2hat4 °C onto a Hybond-XL membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in 17 mm NaH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4. The membrane was exposed to UV light for RNA cross-linking. After a 1-h blocking at 42 °C in 10 ml of ULTRAhyb™ (Ambion), the membrane was probed overnight at 42 °C using an [α32P]dCTP-labeled HIV-1 DNA probe (nucleotide 1–2000) prepared as recommended by the manufacturer (DECAprime™ II, Ambion). After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice for 5 min with 2× SSC (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate)-0.1% SDS buffer and twice for 15 min with 0.1× SSC-0.1% SDS buffer and submitted to autoradiography. Aliquots of RNA were heated at the indicated temperature for 10 min and quickly chilling in ice. Heat-denatured monomeric and dimeric RNAs were separated by electrophoresis through a 0.9% native-agarose gel and analyzed by Northern blotting as described above. Chronically infected H9 cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 30 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Progeny viruses were pelleted as above and resuspended in 90 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cells and viruses were treated with 3 μl of Me2SO4 (Acros Organics) at 37 °C for 4 and 8 min. Reactions were stopped with 1 ml of TriReagent (Molecular Research Center), and RNA was extracted as indicated by the supplier. Modified bases were detected by extension with an avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Qbiogene) of 5′-[γ32P]ATP-labeled primers as described in Ref. 30Paillart J.-C. Westhof E.

Biol. 1997; 270: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In vitro, the 5′-UTR of the HIV-1 genomic RNA folds into a series of independent stem-loop structures (TAR, poly(A), DIS, SD, Ψ) or domains (PBS) (2Berkhout B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11601-11611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Recently, it was proposed that exclusive RNA conformers, LDI and BMH (Fig. 1), may regulate crucial steps in the viral life cycle (6Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 8Berkhout B. Ooms M. Beerens N. Huthoff H. Southern E. Verhoef K. J. Biol.

To test the relevance of these models to the HIV-1 RNA structure ex vivo, we set up conditions to probe the 5′-UTR structure in infected cells and in viral particles. Except for a limited study on murine leukemia virus (31Alford R.L. Honda S. Lawrence C.B. Belmont J.W. Virology. 1991; 183: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the results described below represent the first successful in situ probing of a 9–10-kb retroviral RNA. This technique allowed us to 1) circumvent all in vitro possible biases and artifacts due to the renaturation protocols, the ionic strength conditions, the length of the RNA fragments, or the use of mutants that can induce aberrant RNA folding, and 2) provide a snapshot of viral RNA structure in cells (before packaging and tRNA3Lys annealing) and in mature virions (after packaging and primer annealing). Me2SO4 penetrates cells without permeabilization treatments, thus allowing RNA modification under nearly cell conditions. Chronically infected H9 cells and purified virions were treated with Me2SO4 (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the RNA was extracted after modification. By using an extension assay with primers complementary to sequences located 3′ to the major splice donor site, we were able to specifically detect modified nucleotides in the full-length HIV-1 genomic RNA. Me2SO4 modifies adenines at position N-1 and cytosines at N-3 when the Watson-Crick side of these nucleotides is not base-paired (32Brunel C. Romby P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 3-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, the H9 cell line does not show any defect in protein synthesis and polyprotein proteolysis (data not shown) (27Dettenhofer M. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kao S. Akari H. Khan M.A. Dettenhofer M. Yu X.F. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Typical experiments covering the PBS domain and the SL1, SL2, and SL3 hairpins are shown in Fig. 2. These gels show that the quality of the in situ probing data is very good, and we were able to determine the reactivity level of most adenines and cytosines in cells and viruses. These levels were categorized as highly reactive, weakly reactive, and unreactive and reported on the 5′-UTR secondary structure model (Fig. 3). Importantly, our probing experiments on infected cells show that the main structural domains derived from in vitro experiments also exist ex vivo indicating the rather limited structural differences discussed below.Fig. 3Secondary structure model of the 5′-untranslated region of HIV-1 genomic RNA in infected cells and in virions. The reactivity at the tested Watson-Crick positions (A(N1), C(N3)) are indicated. The functional motifs are indicated above each stem-loop domain. Long distance interactions previously proposed by Abbink and Berkhout (11Abbink T.E. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11601-11611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), Harisson and Lever (3Harrison G.P. Lever A.M.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4144-4153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Paillart et al. (10Paillart J.C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5995-6004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) are represented by brown, blue, and green bars, respectively (the RNA partner for the long distance interaction proposed by Paillart et al. is not present on this model). To facilitate discussion, the PBS domain has been dissected in four structural elements named PBS1 (lower stem), PBS2 (middle stem), PBS3 (A-rich loop stem), and PBS4 (the PBS loop). PAS (pink-purple) and A-rich loop (pink) have been proposed to provide secondary interactions with tRNAlys3 upon binding the PBS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The TAR and poly(A) Hairpins—These domains include TAR, the binding site of Tat, and the poly(A) hairpin that is critical for repression of the 5′-copy of the polyadenylation signal (34Ashe M.P. Furger A. Proudfoot N.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These hairpins are strongly constrained among HIV-1 strains (2Berkhout B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In TAR, the predicted bulges were highly reactive, whereas in the loop, the only highly reactive nucleotide was A34 (Fig. 3), which is in keeping with in vitro chemical probing experiments performed in the absence of proteins (5Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.-L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 35Huthoff H. Girard F. Wijmenga S.S. Berkhout B. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nucleotide C23 located in the Tat binding site was strongly modified (Fig. 3). The in vitro binding of a Tat-derived peptide to this three-nucleotide bulge strongly protected this residue against Me2SO4 modification (35Huthoff H. Girard F. Wijmenga S.S. Berkhout B. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggested that Tat and the P-TEFb complex (positive transcription elongation factor complex b) that binds the TAR apical loop during transcription trans-activation (36Richter S. Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7928-7933Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) do not remain associated with the genomic RNA. To note, this stem is involved in the packaging of the genomic RNA (37Helga-Maria C. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4127-4135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Clever J.L. Eckstein D.A. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 101-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modifications in the poly(A) hairpin are consistent with the proposed secondary structure model. Noticeably, although nucleotides A76, A77, and A78 located in the 5′ part of the poly(A) loop were highly reactive, modification of C80, which is also located in the loop was weak (Fig. 3). The low reactivity of C80 might be the consequence of a long range pseudoknot between nucleotides G79 to C85 and a sequence located in the matrix coding sequence (from G441 to C447) (10Paillart J.C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5995-6004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Ex vivo probing of the matrix coding region will be required to further test this interaction. The PBS Domain—The PBS domain can be separated into four different subdomains that we named PBS1–PBS4 for clarity (Fig. 3). In situ Me2SO4 modification of HXB2NEO RNA did not reveal any significant difference with in vitro experiments performed with HXB2 RNA (39Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4130-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 40Goldschmidt V. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R.

Indeed, all adenines and cytosines that are unpaired in vitro are modified by Me2SO4 in infected cells, in agreement with in situ Me2SO4 probing of the PBS domain of the NL4.3 isolate (41Goldschmidt V.

Thus, the reactivity profile is generally consistent with the proposed secondary structure model, with the exception of the PBS1 stem that either does not exist as such or is strongly breathing, suggesting a possible interaction with a RNA or protein partner as suggested by Laughrea and co-workers (42Shen N. Jette L. Wainberg M.A. Laughrea M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10543-10549Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Leader Region—This region (240–355) encompasses the DIS, SD, and Ψ hairpins that are involved in RNA dimerization, splicing, and encapsidation, respectively (Fig. 3) (2Berkhout B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Paillart J.-C. Shehu-Xhilaga M. Marquet R. Mak J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In vitro, the DIS promotes dimerization of HIV-1 RNA by forming a kissing-loop complex via intermolecular base pairing of the self-complementary sequence in the DIS loop. This complex might eventually be converted into a more stable extended duplex (for review, see Ref. 43Paillart J.-C. Shehu-Xhilaga M. Marquet R. Mak J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In vitro RNA dimerization protects the self-complementary sequence (nucleotides 257–262) from chemical modification, whereas the surrounding purines display a characteristic modification profile (5Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.-L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 30Paillart J.-C. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the DIS loop displays the same reactivity pattern in infected cells (Fig. 2B). In particular, hyperreactivity of the last adenine in the DIS loop (A263), which is the hallmark of in vitro RNA dimerization (5Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.-L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 30Paillart J.-C. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), was also observed in infected cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, our results suggest that HIV-1 genomic RNA might already be dimeric in the infected cells. Alternatively, they could indicate that most cellular viral RNA is associated with budding particles. However, the complete absence of Me2SO4 modification of the self-complementary sequence indicates that the DIS structure is homogenous thus favoring the first interpretation. Moreover, fractionation experiments showed that a significant part of the genomic RNA is nuclear (not shown). Furthermore, our data indicated that the PBS of the cellular RNA is not occupied by tRNA3Lys. As tRNA3Lys annealing occurs early in the budding process (i.e. before processing of the Gag-Pol precursors (44Huang Y. Wang J. Shalom A. Li Z. Khorchid A. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 726-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), we think little RNA from budding virions is present in our cellular RNA. In any case, our data indicated that intermolecular contacts at the DIS occur very early or even before budding of the viral particles. A main difference between ex vivo and in vitro probing data resides at nucleotides C267–A271. Whereas these nucleotides are not reactive in vitro (5Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.-L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 30Paillart J.-C. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), they show a weak but reproducible reactivity toward Me2SO4 in infected cells (Figs. 2B and 3). These nucleotides are located in the DIS upper stem, adjacent to the conserved internal loop B formed by nucleotides 247 and 271–273 (Fig. 3) (1Kuiken C. Foley B. Freed E. Hahn B. Marx P. McCutchan F. Mellors J. Wolinsky S. Korber B. HIV Sequence Compendium 2002. Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2002Google Scholar). Interestingly, this internal loop has a direct impact on RNA dimerization, RNA packaging, and viral infectivity (4Harrison G. Miele G. Hunter E. Lever A. J.

Recent in vitro NMR and biochemical studies suggested that loop B might function by destabilizing the DIS stem (48Takahashi K.I. Baba S. Chattopadhyay P. Koyanagi Y. Yamamoto N. Takaku H. Kawai G.

Our data clearly showed that this part of the upper DIS stem is structurally breathing, suggesting a possible interaction with viral and/or cellular proteins or its direct involvement in tertiary RNA folding. We clearly observed the signatures of the SD and Ψ stem-loop motifs (Figs. 2C and 3), based on in vitro experiments (2Berkhout B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Regulating a Tumor SuppressorJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 279Issue 44PreviewThe PTEN tumor suppressor is the second most commonly mutated tumor suppressor in human tumors. Approximately 20% of PTEN′s tumor-associated mutations are localized to a 70-residue C-terminal segment. These mutations lead to the rapid degradation of PTEN in cells, indicating that this region is critical for regulating PTEN turnover. Studies have shown that phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues within the C-terminal segment play an important role in stabilizing the protein.

Recent genetic studies have revealed that a number of frameshift, nonsense, and missense mutations, which comprise ∼20% of all the known tumor-associated PTEN mutations, are localized to a 70-residue C-terminal segment (3Maehama T.

As a first step toward identifying proteins involved in regulating the phosphorylation and/or turnover of PTEN, we screened for PTEN C-terminal-binding proteins. In this screen we identified a novel PTEN-interacting protein, referred to as PICT-1, encoded by a candidate tumor suppressor gene GLTSCR2 (19Smith J.S. Tachibana I. Pohl U. Lee H.K.

PICT-1 appeared to regulate the phosphorylation and stability of PTEN through its interaction with the C-terminal region. Therefore disruption of the interaction between PICT-1 and PTEN resulted in the rapid degradation of PTEN. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism(s) by which PTEN turnover is controlled. Plasmids—A cDNA encoding the C-terminal region of human PTEN (residues 338–399) was amplified by PCR from FLAG-PTEN/pCMV5 (20Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pAS1-CYH2 (provided by Dr. Stephen J. Elledge) to produce CT/pAS1. Expression vectors for PTEN C-terminal deletion variants (Fig. 1, A and B) were created by cloning corresponding cDNA fragments into pAS1-CYH2 and pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Tumor-derived C-terminal human PTEN mutants, F341V, V343E, and L345Q, were created by site-directed mutagenesis employing a PCR-based strategy. Human PICT-1 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using a 5′-primer that encoded a Myc epitope tag, and the resulting Myc-PICT-1 cDNA was subcloned into pOPRSVI-MCS (Stratagene) and pACT2 (Clontech) to create PICT-1/pOPRSV and PICT-1/pACT2, respectively. Two-Hybrid Screen—To identify proteins that interact with the PTEN C-terminal region, we employed the MATCHMAKER yeast two-hybrid screening system (Clontech). Yeast strain PJ69-2A harboring CT/pAS1 was mated with yeast strain Y187 pre-transformed with a human brain cDNA library according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mated yeast clones were initially subjected to histidine nutritional selection with 6 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazol, and positive clones from the first screening were then further subjected to adenine nutritional selection. Plasmid DNAs were prepared from positive clones and sequenced. A β-galactosidase assay was conducted according to the Clontech Yeast Handbook. Pull-down Assay—Recombinant PTEN proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain JM109 as GST fusion proteins and purified as described previously (20Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar, 21Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) except that the protease cleavage step was omitted. PICT-1 was translated in vitro from Myc-PICT-1/pOPRSV plasmid DNA and simultaneously labeled with [35S]methionine using the TnT T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After the reaction, GST-fusioned PTEN proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added directly to the reaction mixture. After a 12-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then bound proteins on beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation—Human breast cancer MCF7 cells (8 × 106) were dispersed by sonication in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm pyrophosphate, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After debris was removed, 7 μg of rabbit IgG or affinity-purified anti-PICT-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the peptide corresponding to amino acids 37–51 of PICT-1 was added to cleared lysates along with 50 μl of protein A/protein G plus agarose beads (Oncogene). After the samples were incubated for 10 h at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with immunoprecipitation buffer, and then proteins remaining on the beads were resolved on SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were immunoblotted with anti-PTEN 26H9 antibody. Immunoblots—Proteins resolved on SDS-PAGE were transferred to a FluoroTrans membrane (Pall), and then immunoblot analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies used were anti-PTEN (Cascade Bioscience), anti-PTEN 26H9 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-PTEN S380 (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-actin (Sigma). The relative intensity of immunoreactive bands was measured using NIH Image, version 1.62. Typical images from repeated experiments are represented in each figure. All data represent the means ± S.E. from duplicate determinations. Transfections—MCF7 cells (4 × 104 cells/well) were cultured in 12-well plates, and transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Either LipofectAMINE 2000 (4 μl) with 0.4 μg of small interfering RNA (siRNA) or FuGENE 6 (3 μl) with 2 μg of DNA was used for each transfection. For co-transfection of siRNA and DNA (Fig. 3), 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 and 0.2 μg each of siRNA and DNA were used. Preparation of siRNA—21-Nucleotide RNA duplexes with UU overhangs at both 3′-ends were prepared by T7 RNA polymerase-based in vitro transcription as described by Yu et al. (22Yu J.Y. DeRuiter S.L. Turner D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6047-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Target sequences of GLT247 and GLT318 siRNAs correspond to nucleotides 247–267 and 318–338 of GLTSCR2 (GenBank™ accession No. AF182076), respectively. GFP5 control siRNA was described by Yu et al. (22Yu J.Y. DeRuiter S.L. Turner D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6047-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). RT-PCR—Total RNA isolated from MCF7 cell was used as a template to synthesize cDNA utilizing Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Toyobo). PCR was performed in a 10-μl reaction mixture using 0.2 μg of cDNA as a template. Primers used were GGACACTGGCTCCAAGGAAAAAG and TCTGGTGGTCTTCAAAGGATGG for PICT-1, CCTTTTGAAGACCATAACCCACC and ATCACCACACACAGGTAACGGC for PTEN, and GGAGAAAATCTGGCACCACACCT and AGGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAGAGTG for actin. Identification of PTEN C-terminal Region-binding Proteins—To identify proteins that interact with the C-terminal region of human PTEN, we performed a two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using the C-terminal region of PTEN (residues 338–399) as bait. The extreme C terminus of PTEN (residues 400–403), which contains a PDZ-binding motif, was deleted to selectively exclude interactions with PDZ domains. In this screen, we isolated 12 clones of which eight were determined to be false positives and two encoded unknown proteins. Of the two remaining clones, one corresponded to amino acids 10–478 of a protein encoded by a human tumor suppressor candidate gene, GLTSCR2, and the other corresponded to amino acids 673–839 of human Vps16. We have referred to the gene product of GLTSCR2 as PICT-1 because of its ability to bind to the C-terminal region of PTEN. Although both proteins may exert a relevant biological function by binding to PTEN, we have focused herein on the characterization of PICT-1. Interaction of PICT-1 with PTEN—To confirm our two-hybrid screen results and evaluate the relative contribution of the C-terminal region of PTEN to binding of PICT-1, we first conducted GST pull-down assays using wild-type and deletion mutants of PTEN. The full-length wild-type GST-PTEN fusion protein exhibited significant binding to radiolabeled PICT-1 produced by in vitro translation (Fig. 1A, WT), whereas GST alone did not bind (Fig. 1A, GST). Deletion of the C-terminal segment (338–403) caused a remarkable decrease (by 93%) in the binding of PICT-1 (Fig. 1A, dCT). A construct in which only the C-terminal segment (338–399) of PTEN was fused to GST also exhibited significant binding to PICT-1 (Fig. 1B, CT). However, this fusion protein did not bind PICT-1 as well as the GST-PTEN wild-type bait (32% of wild type). Although this result suggests that the C-terminal segment may not be the sole determinant of PTEN interaction with PICT-1, these data collectively indicate that the C-terminal region of PTEN plays an indispensable role for its interaction with PICT-1. Yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated that deletion of the 338–348 segment resulted in a complete loss of the binding ability of PTEN to PICT-1 (Fig. 1B), indicating that a critical amino acid residue(s) was located within this 11-amino acid segment. Further, the PDZ-binding motif at the C terminus of PTEN showed no effects on the binding (Fig. 1B). We also performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay to determine whether an interaction between endogenous PICT-1 and PTEN proteins could be detected in intact cells. For this purpose, we utilized MCF7 cells that contain endogenous PTEN and PICT-1 proteins. As shown in Fig. 1C, the PICT-1 immunoprecipitated from MCF7 cell lysate by the anti-PICT-1 antibody was positive for interaction with endogenous PTEN protein, whereas no PTEN could be detected within the control rabbit IgG immunocomplex. Association of PTEN within the anti-PICT-1 immunocomplex was completely blocked by the corresponding PICT-1 peptide (Fig. 1C, PEP), confirming that endogenous PICT-1 and PTEN proteins can interact in intact cells. Tumor-associated PTEN C-terminal Mutants Lose the Ability to Bind to PICT-1—The region that appeared to be responsible for the interaction with PICT-1 (Fig. 1, A and B) is nearly identical to a known “hot spot” (341–348) for C-terminal tumor-associated missense mutations (3Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 5Ali I.U. Schriml L.M. Dean M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1922-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, one of these hot spot mutants, L345Q, was reported to exhibit extreme susceptibility to rapid protein turnover in cells (6Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This implies the relevance of PICT-1 binding in the regulation of PTEN stability. To explore this possibility, we first tested the binding ability to PICT-1 of tumor-derived C-terminal mutants F341V, V343E, and L345Q. When tested using yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2A), we found that all of these mutations resulted in a complete loss of binding to PICT-1. A GST pull-down assay also showed significant decrease in the binding ability of these mutants to PICT-1 (Fig. 2B), a reduction comparable with that observed when the PTEN C-terminal segment (338–403) was removed completely. We next carried out a cycloheximide pulse-chase experiment and determined the stability of these mutant PTEN proteins in MCF7 cells. MCF7 cells ectopically expressing PTEN mutant proteins were exposed to cycloheximide to abrogate protein synthesis, and then the level of PTEN protein was assessed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2C, reductions in mutant PTEN levels by 80–90% were observed by 6-h cycloheximide treatment, whereas ∼90% of wild-type PTEN remained by the same treatment. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest an essential role for the binding of PTEN to PICT-1 in the stabilization of PTEN protein and provide an explanation for the “loss-of-function” mutations that frequently occur in this region. The C-terminal PTEN mutants, including both deletion and missense mutants that no longer bind efficiently to PICT-1, cannot be protected from degradation and undergo rapid turnover. PICT-1 Functions as a Regulator of PTEN Turnover—To confirm the role of PICT-1 in regulating PTEN turnover in cells, we next asked whether the down-regulation of PICT-1 directly affects the degradation of wild-type PTEN. For this purpose, we employed an RNA interference method utilizing PICT-1-targeted siRNAs GLT247 and GLT318, which substantially inhibited the ectopic expression of PICT-1 (data not shown). MCF7 cells transfected with FLAG-PTEN/pCMV and either GLT247 or GLT318 were exposed to cycloheximide, and then the level of FLAG-PTEN was assessed by immunoblotting to determine the rate of PTEN degradation (Fig. 3A). In control cells, a 5-h cycloheximide treatment did not significantly affect the level of PTEN, whereas reductions in PTEN levels by 21 and 48% were observed in GLT247-and GLT318-treated cells, respectively (Fig. 3A). Because these findings collectively indicate that PICT-1 plays an essential role in regulating PTEN turnover, we next tested the effect of PICT-1 down-regulation on the steady-state expression level of endogenous PTEN in MCF7 cells. Treatment of MCF7 cells with these siRNAs reduced the level of PTEN by 40–50%, whereas the control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 3B). It is of note that in this experiment MCF7 cells were cultured longer (48 h) after the siRNA transfection than in the cycloheximide-chase experiment (24 h; see Fig. 3A) to observe a significant effect of PICT-1 down-regulation on endogenous PTEN levels. The residual PTEN protein observed in GLT247- and GLT318-treated samples is likely to be derived from cells into which siRNAs were not effectively delivered and/or because of the relatively long half-life of PTEN protein in MCF7 cells (data not shown, but see Figs. 2C and 3A). The overall reduction in the PTEN expression was coincident with a reduction in the PICT-1 transcript, whereas the level of PTEN and actin mRNAs remained unaffected (Fig. 3C). From these data, we conclude that the reduction in the level of PTEN protein induced by the PICT-1 RNA interference is likely because of changes in the rate of protein degradation. The involvement of PICT-1 in maintaining PTEN stability also raises the intriguing possibility that PICT-1 loss-of-function mutations may result in the reduction of cellular PTEN in vivo. The GLTSCR2 gene, which encodes PICT-1, is located in a 150-kb minimal common deletion region for human gliomas, and thus it was originally identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene (19Smith J.S. Tachibana I. Pohl U. Lee H.K. Thanarajasingam U. Portier B.P. Ueki K. Ramaswamy S. Billings S.J. Mohrenweiser H.W. Louis D.N. Jenkins R.B. Genomics. 2000; 64: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of PICT-1 expression may function to destabilize PTEN and subsequently deregulate PI3K/PIP3-mediated signals, even if no PTEN mutations are present. Our findings suggest a novel tumorigenic pathway that is dependent on the loss of PTEN function but independent of genetic lesions in the PTEN gene. The effect of impaired PICT-1 on PTEN signaling and function could be quite complex. This would be in part because the potential of tissue-specific expression of PICT-1 and PTEN, as well as the phosphorylation of the PTEN C-terminal region, may have multiple effects in addition to promoting PTEN stability (13Vazquez F.

The significance of PICT-1 as a regulator of PI3K/PIP3-mediated signals is currently under investigation, and further study will be required to demonstrate a biological role for PICT-1. PICT-1 Regulates PTEN C-terminal Phosphorylation—We next looked into the underlying mechanism for the stabilization of PTEN protein by PICT-1. A number of reports have shown that the phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues within the C-terminal segment of PTEN plays a crucial role in stabilizing the PTEN protein (13Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 14Tolkacheva T. Boddapati M. Sanfiz A. Tsuchida K. Kimmelman A.C. Chan A.M.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The increased turnover rate of PTEN associated with down-regulation of PICT-1 raises the possibility that PICT-1 might affect the phosphorylation state of PTEN. To test this possibility, we analyzed the effect of PICT-1 on the phosphorylation of Ser-380 of PTEN, which is one of the crucial phosphorylation sites necessary for stabilizing PTEN in cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the level of endogenous PTEN protein was comparable in each siRNA-transfected cell at 24 h post-transfection, and down-regulation of PICT-1 by RNA interference significantly reduced the level of PTEN phosphorylation at Ser-380. Moreover, remarkable reductions (52 ± 4.3% for F341V; 38 ± 1.2% for V343E; 76 ± 5.8% for L345Q) in Ser-380 phosphorylation were also associated with these degradation-susceptible mutants (Figs. 2B and 4B), indicating that their rapid degradation resulted from reduced phosphorylation caused by an inability to interact with PICT-1. These results indicate that PICT-1 can regulate the phosphorylation of PTEN at Ser-380, and thus the binding of PTEN to PICT-1 governs its turnover via phosphorylation of the C-terminal region. Recent studies have shown that five Ser/Thr residues within the C-terminal segment, including Ser-380, are phosphorylated and may contribute to the stabilization of PTEN protein. In particular, phosphorylation at Thr-382 and Thr-383 of PTEN has been suggested to be the most critical for stabilization (13Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 14Tolkacheva T. Boddapati M. Sanfiz A. Tsuchida K. Kimmelman A.C. Chan A.M.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, in the MCF7 cells utilized in this study, phosphorylation of neither Thr-382 nor Thr-383 was likely to contribute significantly to PTEN stabilization, because a phosphorylation-resistant mutant, T382A/T383A, retained its stability in MCF7 cells and its degradation rate was indistinguishable from that of wild-type PTEN (data not shown). Although we cannot rule out a mutually exclusive effect between binding of PICT-1 and phosphorylation at other Ser/Thr residues within the C-terminal region, our findings suggest that Ser-380 is one of the phosphorylation sites that plays a crucial role in the regulation of PTEN turnover. Our findings also raise the question as to which kinases and phosphatases are involved in the regulation of PTEN turnover. Casein kinase 2 has been implicated in the phosphorylation of the PTEN C-terminal region; however, Ser-380 is a poor match for the casein kinase 2 phosphorylation recognition sequence. It is therefore possible that unidentified kinase(s) may be responsible for this process, and PICT-1 may affect Ser-380 phosphorylation by activating a kinase and/or inhibiting a phosphatase. More detailed study will be required to address these possibilities. We are grateful to Dr. Gregory S. Taylor for critical reading of the manuscript and helpful comments. We are also grateful to Dr. Kim Orth for helpful comments and initial evaluation of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1990402093,"Leishmania, a unicellular trypanosomatid protozoan parasite, causes a wide range of human diseases ranging from the localized self-healing cutaneous lesions to fatal visceral leishmaniasis. However, it undergoes a process of programmed cell death during treatment with the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin (CPT). The present study shows that CPT-induced formation of reactive oxygen species increases the level of cytosolic calcium through the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores as well as by influx of extracellular calcium. Elevation of cytosolic calcium is responsible for depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), which is followed by a significant decrease in intracellular pH levels. CPT-induced oxidative stress also causes impairment of the Na+-K+-ATPase pump and subsequently decreases the intracellular K+ level in leishmanial cells. A decrease in both intracellular pH and K+ levels propagates the apoptotic process through activation of caspase 3-like proteases by rapid formation of cytochrome c-mediated apoptotic complex. In addition to caspase-like protease activation, a lower level of intracellular K+ also enhances the activation of apoptotic nucleases at the late stage of apoptosis. This suggests that the physiological level of pH and K+ are inhibitory for apoptotic DNA fragmentation and caspase-like protease activation in leishmanial cells. Moreover, unlike mammalian cells, the intracellular ATP level gradually decreases with an increase in the number of apoptotic cells after the loss of ΔΨm. Taken together, the elucidation of biochemical events, which tightly regulate the process of growth arrest and death of Leishmania donovani promastigotes, allows us to define a more comprehensive view of cell death during treatment with CPT.

DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the breakage and rejoining of DNA strands to permit topological changes in DNA (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar). They are classified into two types. Type I topoisomerase breaks and rejoins one strand of duplex DNA, whereas type II topoisomerase breaks and rejoins both strands of DNA by using ATP as cofactor (2Sutcliffe J.A. Gootz T.D. Barrett J.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 2027-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These enzymes play a pivotal role in the maintenance of genome integrity and are essential for many chromosomal functions including DNA replication, recombinations, transcription, and chromosome segregation (3Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6659-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other than the orderly synthesis of nucleic acids, these enzymes also have been identified as the molecular targets for numerous clinically important antibacterial and antitumor agents like fluoroquinolone, etoposide, and camptothecin (CPT), 1The abbreviations used are: CPT, camptothecin; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; BHT, butylated hydroxy toluene; FFA, flufenamic acid; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin; Fura 2AM, fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester; PBFI-AM, potassium binding benzofuran isophthalate acetoxymethyl ester; PMSF, phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TG, thapsigargin; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PI, propidium iodide.1The abbreviations used are: CPT, camptothecin; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; BHT, butylated hydroxy toluene; FFA, flufenamic acid; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin; Fura 2AM, fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester; PBFI-AM, potassium binding benzofuran isophthalate acetoxymethyl ester; PMSF, phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TG, thapsigargin; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PI, propidium iodide. etc. (2Sutcliffe J.A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 6659-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPT, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I, has been widely used to induce apoptosis under experimental conditions and is in phase III clinical trials for colon cancer (4Sledge Jr., G.W. Miller K. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cunningham D. Glimelius B. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 6-12PubMed Google Scholar). Poisoning of topoisomerase I by CPT causes protein-linked single strand breaks, but the breaks are by themselves not sufficient for cell death. The collision between the DNA replication fork with CPT-stabilized topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complex is thought to be responsible for cell killing (6Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The double strand breaks resulting from the fork arrest are repaired very slowly and lead to prolonged S phase or G2 arrest of the cell cycle, followed by apoptosis (7Tsao Y.P. Russo A. Nyamuswa G. Silber R. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5908-5914PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis, a physiological mode of cell death, results from the action of a genetically encoded suicide program that leads to series of characteristic morphological and biochemical changes (8Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). These changes include activation of caspases, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and nucleosomal degradation (9Wyllie A.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). But the most significant event in apoptosis is mitochondrial dysfunction, which was shown to be involved in an early phase of apoptosis in a variety of cells upon induction of a number of stimuli including tumor necrosis factor (10Lancaster Jr., J.R. Laster S.M. Gooding L.R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 248: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), glucocorticoids (11Petit P.X. Lecoeur H. Zorn E. Dauguet C. Mignotte B. Gougeon M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), ceramides (12Quillet-Mary A. Jaffrezou J.P. Mansat V. Bordier C. Naval J. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), and oxidative stress (13Fleury C. Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 14Nosseri C. Coppola S. Ghibelli L. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As compared with necrosis, apoptosis is an energy-dependent process requiring functional mitochondria. Without the supply of ATP, cell cannot transmit apoptotic death signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (15Yasuhara N. Eguchi Y. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, changes in the intracellular concentration of cations are responsible for alterations in cell volume, which is one of the most striking morphological changes during the process of apoptosis (16Garrahan P.J. Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1967; 192: 217-235Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). But very little is known about the effects of these ionic changes on the activity of underlying apoptotic machineries, including caspases and nucleases. Caspases are synthesized and maintained in the cytoplasm as proenzymes, which themselves must undergo a proteolytic activation, perhaps triggering apoptosis. The substrates cleaved by these enzymes are numerous, including structural proteins (17Kayalar C. Ord T. Testa M.P. Zhong L.T. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2234-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 18Martin S.J. O'Brien G.A. Nishioka W.K. McGahon A.J. Mahboubi A. Saido T.C. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6425-6428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and degradative enzymes (19Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to caspase activation, nucleases are activated, which destroy the genome to produce DNA fragments, recognized as the DNA ladder. Leishmaniasis, one of the dreaded protozoal diseases threatening mankind, does not have enough combative measures. CPT has been shown to inhibit type I DNA topoisomerase of Leishmania donovani promastigotes and leads to apoptosis. To characterize the cellular events associated with apoptosis, we have found that CPT-induced oxidative stress causes depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. This is followed by the activation of caspase-like proteases inside leishmanial cells after the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (20Sen N. Das B.B. Ganguly A. Mukherjee T. Tripathi G. Bandyopadhyay S. Rakshit S. Sen T. Majumder H.K. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 924-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). But the molecular mechanisms connecting ion fluxes to the apoptotic machinery are still unknown, and these aspects remain to be investigated for the apoptotic cell death in unicellular parasites like L. donovani during treatment with CPT. Here we have dissected the mechanism of action of CPT by analyzing the nuclear, mitochondrial, and cytosolic changes associated with apoptosis of leishmanial cells. In the present study we show that changes in the level of both cytosolic cations (calcium and potassium) and alterations in the level of ATP and pH regulate the apoptotic process by controlling the mitochondrial membrane potential and activity of caspase-like proteases and endonucleases. Taken together, our results provide the first insight into the mechanistic pathway of apoptosis in leishmanial cells where a decrease in cytosolic K+ ion concentrations and alterations in pH homeostasis by the topoisomerase I poison CPT appears to be an essential event responsible for the propagation of apoptosis. Parasite Culture and Maintenance—Leishmania strain AG 83 promastigotes were grown at 22 °C in M199 liquid media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Drug Solutions—CPT was dissolved in 100% Me2SO at 20 mm concentration and stored at -20 °C. BHT, NAC, FFA, and verapamil were dissolved in 100% Me2SO at 50 mm concentration and stored at -20 °C. Measurement of ROS Level—Intracellular ROS level was measured in treated and untreated cells as described by Mukherjee et al. (21Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiram G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 107) after different treatments were washed and resuspended in 500 μl of medium 199 and were loaded with the cell-permeant probe 5-(and -6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate acetyl ester. It is a nonpolar compound and is hydrolyzed within the cell to form a nonfluorescent derivative, which in the presence of a proper oxidant is converted to a fluorescent product. Fluorescence was measured through a spectrofluorometer by using 507 nm as excitation and 530 nm as emission wavelengths. For all measurements basal fluorescence was subtracted. Intracellular Ca2+Measurement—Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured with the fluorescent probe Fura 2AM as described by Sarkar and Bhaduri (22Sarkar D. Bhaduri A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells with differently treated groups were harvested and washed twice with wash buffer containing 116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. Cells were then suspended in the same buffer containing 15% sucrose and were incubated with Fura 2AM (6 μm) at 27 °C for 1 h with mild shaking. Cells were pelleted down, and after two subsequent washing steps were suspended in the same wash buffer. Cells were visualized and quantified by TCS-SP Leica confocal microscope using a software, Z-profile measurement with statistics within the region of interest following the instruction manual (Leica Confocal Systems User Manual TCS SP2). Here this function was used to determine the maximum values of the intensity of Ca2+-bound Fura 2 within each parasite. It should be noted that 100 cells per group with comparable intensity were calculated for each condition. Another set of cells was used for spectrofluorometric analysis. Fluorescence measurements were performed with excitation at 340 nm and emission at 510 nm. To convert fluorescent values into absolute calcium concentration, calibration was performed at the end of the each experiment. Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was calculated using Equation 1,[Ca2+]=Kd(F−Fmin)/(Fmax−F)(Eq. 1) where Kd is the dissociation constant of the calcium-bound Fura 2 complex, and Fmin represents the minimum fluorescence of the cells after adding 4 mm EGTA, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Triton X-100 simultaneously to the sample. Fmax corresponds to the maximum fluorescence of the cells after adding 10 mm CaCl2 to the above-treated cells. Measurement of Intracellular K+Level—Intracellular K+ level was measured in both treated and untreated cells using PBFI-AM as the cell-permeant probe (23Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 107) after different treatments were harvested and were washed twice with wash buffer containing 116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. Cells were then suspended in the same buffer containing 15% sucrose and incubated with PBFI-AM (5 μm) at 27 °C for 1 h with mild shaking. Then cells were pelleted down and after two subsequent washing steps were suspended in the same wash buffer. Fluorescence was measured for the dye-treated and washed cells at 340 and 380 nm excitation and at 500 nm as emission wavelength. PBFI shows an excitation spectral shift upon binding and so was calibrated by using a ratio of the fluorescence intensities at two different wavelengths in varied K+ buffers in the presence of valinomycin (24Jezek P. Mahdi F. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10522-10526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The value of intracellular K+ level in experimental samples was calculated from the calibration curve. Assay for Na+-K+-ATPase Activity—The plasma membrane of L. donovani promastigotes has a characteristic structure that provides strength to the membrane against hypotonic shock. Unsealed ghosts devoid of flagella were prepared according to Mukherjee et al. (25Mukherjee T. Mandal D. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5563-5569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 g of treated and untreated cells were collected at mid-log phase and suspended in 25 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm PMSF. Cell suspensions were kept at 4 °C and were mixed by mild vortexing to detach flagella from the cell body. Formation of unsealed ghosts was confirmed by total leakage of the marker cytoplasmic enzymes (26Mandal D. Mukherjee T. Sarkar S. Majumdar S. Bhaduri A. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Aliquots of each unsealed ghost (about 5 mg protein/ml) were incubated in a medium containing 3 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2,1mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 110 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 120 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, and 75 nmol of [γ-32P]ATP (0.15 μCi, specific activity 3000 Ci/nmol) to a total volume of 150 μl. After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 8%. A 150-μl suspension of 50% activated charcoal in water and 10 μl of 100 mm KH2PO4 were added to the above suspension. After mild agitation for 10 min, charcoal was precipitated by centrifugation. The process was repeated two more times, and finally 100 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a scintillation counter. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The fluorescence of the mitosenser reagent (BD Biosciences) is considered as an indicator of relative mitochondrial energy state. When mitochondrial membrane depolarizes, the dye remains as a monomer (emission 530 nm, green fluorescence), but during normal or higher membrane potential, the dye remains as an aggregate (red fluorescence, emission 590 nm) (20Sen N. Das B.B. Ganguly A. Mukherjee T. Tripathi G. Bandyopadhyay S. Rakshit S. Sen T. Majumder H.K. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 924-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells after different treatments were harvested and washed with 1× PBS. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 1 h with a final concentration of mitosensor reagent (BD Biosciences) at 5 μg/μl (according to the manufacturer's protocol). Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry as well as by fluorescence measurements. The ratio of the reading at 590 nm to the reading at 530 nm (590/530 ratio) was considered as the relative ΔΨm value. Measurement of ATP Level—The ATP content was determined by the luciferin-luciferase method (27Kricka L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the requirement of luciferase for ATP in producing light (emission maximum 560 nm at pH 7.8). Briefly, cells (2 × 107) after different treatments were harvested and resuspended in 1× PBS. An aliquot of this cell suspension was assayed for ATP using the Sigma chemical luciferase ATP assay kit. The amount of ATP in experimental samples was calculated from a standard curve prepared with ATP and expressed as nmol/107 cells. Intracellular pH Measurements—Intracellular pH was measured with the fluorescent probe BCECF as described by Mukherjee et al. (25Mukherjee T. Mandal D. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5563-5569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and washed two times with wash buffer containing 116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. Cells were then suspended in the same buffer containing 15% sucrose and incubated with BCECF-AM (10 μm) at 27 °C for 1 h with mild shaking. The cells were pelleted and after two subsequent washing steps were suspended in the same wash buffer. Fluorescence was measured for the dye-treated and washed cells in a Hitachi spectrofluorometer (model F4010) at 440 and 490 nm excitation and at 535 nm emission wavelengths. Calibration of the internal pH of the control promastigotes was done by incubating the BCECF-loaded cells in the varied pH buffers in the presence of nigericin (1 μg/ml). The value of pH in the experimental samples was calculated from the calibration curve. Preparation of Cytoplasmic Extract—Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared both in treated and untreated cells according to Das et al. (28Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 107) after different treatments were harvested, suspended in cell extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 200 μm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin), and lysed by a process of freeze-thaw using nitrogen cavitation and a 37 °C water bath simultaneously. Then lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h, and supernatants were used as a source of cytoplasmic extract. Protein was estimated by the Bio-Rad protein determination kit. Determination of Caspase Activity—Cytosolic extracts from untreated leishmanial cells were adjusted to different pH values by mixing various concentrations of NaOH or HCl solutions. To initiate caspase-like protease activation, 10-μl aliquots of the extracts were incubated with cytochrome c (10 μm) and/or 1 mm dATP at 30 °C for 1 h. For caspase activity measurements, 4 μl of the mixture (30 μg of protein) was brought to 100 μl in caspase buffer (final concentration 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm DTT) together with 100 μm DEVD-AFC. AFC release was measured fluorometrically at 505 nm (29Matsuyama S. Llopis J. Deveraux Q.L. Tsien R.Y. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Isolation of Nuclear Fraction from Leishmanial Cells—Nuclear fractions were prepared from CPT-treated and untreated cells according to Chakraborty et al. (30Chakraborty A.K. Gupta A. Majumder H.K. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 30: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, and 5 mm DTT) and were homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 rpm in Sorvall RC5B centrifuge using an SS34 rotor. The pellet was washed with the same buffer and centrifuged as above. The pellet was suspended in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and was used as a source for nuclear fraction. Preparation of Nuclear Extract from Leishmanial Cells—To prepare nuclear extract from isolated nuclear fractions of CPT-treated leishmanial cells, nuclei were suspended in 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and were ultracentrifuged at 1,65,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Supernatants were used as a source of nuclear extract like other mammalian cells (31Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1190-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 91-99Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HeLa Nuclei Assay—The nuclei from healthy growing HeLa cells were isolated according to Schwartzman and Cidlowski (31Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1190-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 91-99Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.25% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were pelleted down and suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. For the DNA fragmentation assay, 2 × 107 nuclei were suspended in CPT-treated nuclear extract of leishmanial cells and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2. After incubation, 25 mm EDTA, 540 mm NaCl, and 0.5% SDS were added to these solutions. Then proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and was incubated at 55 °C for 1 h. This was followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. Then DNAs were precipitated, dissolved in TE buffer, and electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel. Double Staining with Hoechst 33342 and Propidium Iodide—Condensation of genomic DNA is one of the characteristic nuclear phenotypes of apoptotic cells. To distinguish between apoptotic, necrotic, and viable cells, these were stained with Hoechst 33342 and PI according to Das et al. (28Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after fixing with 2% paraformaldehyde, cells were incubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min for permeabilization, washed with 1× PBS, and incubated with Hoechst 33342 and PI for 10 min. Then cells were visualized with a TCS-SP Leica confocal microscope. Healthy viable cells were stained only with Hoechst and were identified by dull blue nuclei, but apoptotic cells were identified with bright blue nuclei. PI only penetrates necrotic cells and stained the nuclei red. Total cells versus only bright blue cells were calculated, and data are expressed as percentage of apoptotic cells. It should be noted that 100 cells per group with identical morphology were calculated for each condition. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. unless mentioned. Comparisons were made between different treatments using unpaired Student's t test. CPT Induces Oxidative Stress in L. donovani Promastigotes—When L. donovani promastigotes were treated with CPT, ROS were generated inside cells (20Sen N. Das B.B. Ganguly A. Mukherjee T. Tripathi G. Bandyopadhyay S. Rakshit S. Sen T. Majumder H.K. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 924-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), which can be measured fluorometrically by conversion of 5-(and -6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate acetyl ester to highly fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescein in the presence of a proper oxidant. The level of ROS in CPT-treated cells remains 4-fold higher compared with the levels of ROS of control cells throughout the experiment (Fig. 1). When cells were treated with NAC prior to the treatment with CPT, the level of ROS generation was reduced to the extent of 80% compared with that in Me2SO-treated control cells. CPT-induced Oxidative Stress Inactivates Na+-K+-ATPase Pump and Subsequently Decreases Intracellular Potassium Level—Extrusion of K+ ions from cells has been suggested to mediate the loss of cell volume, which is one of the most significant events in apoptosis (23Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed K+ levels in these parasites using the dye PBFI-AM that is specific for intracellular K+. As shown in Fig. 2A, the PBFI-AM fluorescence decreased more than 65% in the CPT-treated leishmanial cells relative to the normal cells, demonstrating that lowered K+ levels are restricted to the apoptotic cells. The decrease in intracellular K+ ions is because of impairment of the Na+-K+-ATPase pump, which is a main mechanism for the regulation of K+ ions inside cells both in higher eukaryotes as well as in protozoan parasites (33Mann C.L. Bortner C.D. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5059-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 34Felibertt P. Bermudez R. Cervino V. Dawidowicz K. Dagger F. Proverbio T. Marin R. Benaim G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). So we have measured the activity of the Na+-K+-ATPase pump during treatment with CPT. The activity of Na+-K+-ATPase was about 56 nmol/mg protein/min, which remained almost unchanged throughout the experiment. In the presence of CPT, the activity of Na+-K+-ATPase decreased to the extent of 48% after 1 h. The inhibition of the activity of this P-type ATPase further decreased to 67% after 2 h of treatment with CPT. Based on the data published elsewhere (20Sen N. Das B.B. Ganguly A. Mukherjee T. Tripathi G. Bandyopadhyay S. Rakshit S. Sen T. Majumder H.K. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 924-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), it appears that the impairment of Na+-K+-ATPase was because of both formation of ROS inside the cell and an increase in lipid peroxidation. This was confirmed by recovery of the Na+-K+-ATPase activity to about 80% after treating cells with different antioxidants like NAC (20 mm) and BHT (20 mm) (a specific inhibitor of lipid peroxidation) prior to the treatment with CPT (Fig. 2B). CPT-induced Oxidative Stress Causes Increase in Cytosolic Ca2+Level—Many studies have shown that calcium flux is absolutely necessary not only for the activation of different proteases (35Tagliarino C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19150-19159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) but also for the appearance of phosphatidyl-serine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (36Yu A. Byers D.M. Ridgway N.D. McMaster C.R. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) during apoptosis.

These proteins are classified in group A and B based on the number of conserved cysteine residues in their SRCR domains, i.e. six for group A and eight for group B. The protein DMBT1 (deleted in malignant brain tumors 1), which is identical to salivary agglutinin and lung gp-340, belongs to the group B SRCR proteins and is considered to be involved in tumor suppression and host defense by pathogen binding. In a previous study we used nonoverlapping synthetic peptides covering the SRCR consensus sequence to identify a 16-amino acid bacteria-binding protein loop (peptide SRCRP2; QGRVEVLYRGSWGTVC) within the SRCR domains. In this study, using overlapping peptides, we pinpointed the minimal bacteria-binding site on SRCRP2, and thus DMBT1, to an 11-amino acid motif (DMBT1 pathogen-binding site 1 or DMBT1pbs1; GRVEVLYRGSW). An alanine substitution scan revealed that VEVL and Trp are critical residues in this motif. Bacteria binding by DMBT1pbs1 was different from the bacteria binding by the macrophage receptor MARCO in which an RXR motif was critical.

This group of glycoproteins comprises cell surface molecules as well as secreted proteins that are characterized by the presence of one or more SRCR domains. SRCR domains consist of ∼110 amino acids and are divided into groups A and B based on the number of conserved cysteine residues, namely six for group A and eight for group B. The best studied members of the group A SRCR proteins are the macrophage scavenger receptor (MSR1), the Mac 2-binding protein (Mac-2bp), and MARCO. Both MSR1 and MARCO are known to interact with bacteria (6Brännström A. Sankala M. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Dunne D.W. Resnick D. Greenberg J. Krieger M. Joiner K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteria binding by MARCO involves an RXR motif within the SRCR domain, indicating that ionic interactions play a crucial role in the interaction with its negatively charged ligands (6Brännström A.

Group B SRCR proteins are generally involved in the regulation of cellular immune responses. In vertebrates, the group B SRCR proteins can be divided, on the basis of their structure and sequence homology, into three subgroups (11Grønlund J. Vitved L. Lausen M. Skjødt K. Holmskov U. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6406-6415Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The first subgroup includes CD5 (12Jones N.H. Clabby M.L. Dialynas D.P. Huang H.J. Herzenberg L.A. Strominger J.L. Nature. 1986; 323: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), CD6 (13Aruffo A. Melnick M.B. Linsley P.S. Seed B. J. Exp.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6151-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CD5 and CD6 are composed of an extracellular region of three SRCR domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region. SPα lacks the latter two regions but contains three SRCR domains that are highly homologous to those of CD5 and CD6. These three proteins are mainly expressed by T-cells and B-cells (12Jones N.H.

Med. 1991; 174: 949-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The second subgroup of SRCR group B molecules is the workshop cluster 1 (WC1) family, which includes WC1, CD163, and M160 (11Grønlund J. Vitved L. Lausen M. Skjødt K. Holmskov U. J.

These proteins represent the DMBT1 isoforms secreted in the saliva (DMBT1SAG) and the lung fluid (DMBT1GP340), respectively. For about two decades DMBT1SAG, which manifests a broad bacteria binding spectrum, has been intensively investigated with regard to its role in caries prevention by binding and agglutination of cariogenic bacteria in the oral cavity (31Carlén A. Bratt P. Stenudd C. Olsson J. Strömberg N. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Ericson T. Rundegren J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). DMBT1GP340 is putatively involved in respiratory tract protection because it interacts with the defense collectin surfactant proteins D (SP-D) and A (SP-A) and is able to stimulate alveolar macrophage migration (18Holmskov U.

Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). By initial protein digestion and utilization of non-overlapping synthetic peptides, we recently identified a protein loop in the SRCR domains of DMBT1 that was able to bind to various bacteria (16Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.-J. Law S.K.A. Moestrop S.K. Nature. 2001; 409: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The use of synthetic peptides thus offered us a simple in vitro system to explore fundamental aspects of DMBT1- and SRCR-mediated bacteria binding in general. In this study we have defined the minimal bacteria-binding motif on DMBT1 as an 11-mer peptide designated DMBT1pbs1 (DMBT1 pathogen-binding site 1). By an alanine substitution scan, critical amino acid residues within this motif were identified. Consensus peptides were derived from the DMBT1pbs1-corresponding regions of other SRCR proteins. Only the peptides derived from DMBT1 and its orthologues showed significant bacterial binding. Purification of DMBT1SAG—DMBT1SAG was purified by gel filtration as described previously (29Ligtenberg T.J.M. Bikker F.J. Groenink J. Tornøe I. Leth-Larsen R. Veerman E.C.I. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Holmskov U. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). DMBT1SAG was eluted from a Sephacryl S-400 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) with either phosphate-buffered saline or Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Bacteria—Streptococcus mutans (Ingbritt), Streptococcus gordonii (HG222), and Escherichia coli (OM36–1) were cultured on blood agar plates under anaerobic conditions with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 48 h. Subsequently, single colonies of S. mutans and S. gordonii were cultured in Todd Hewitt medium (Oxoid, Hampshire, United Kingdom). Single colonies of E. coli were cultured in Luria Broth (Oxoid) at 37 °C for 24 h in air/CO2 (19:1). Cells were harvested and washed twice in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 1 mm CaCl2 (TTC). Helicobacter pylori (NCTC 11637) was cultured on selective Dent plates (Oxoid) at 37 °C for 72 h. H. pylori was harvested by wiping off the plates and washed twice in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4,2, supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 1 mm CaCl2. Bacteria were diluted in buffer to a final OD700 of 0.5, corresponding with ∼5 × 108 cells/ml.

For determination of the minimal bacteria binding site we synthesized overlapping 16-mer peptides covering the SRCR consensus sequence ranging from six amino acids toward the amino terminus (peptide SRCRP + 6N) to six amino acids toward the carboxyl-terminus (SRCRP2 + 6C), relative to SRCRP2. To study the role of the individual amino acids in pathogen binding, we synthesized a set of peptides in which each residue, in its turn, was substituted for alanine (alanine substitution scan). To identify corresponding sequences in other SRCR proteins, the Pfam data base (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/index.shtml) was searched using “SRCR” or the Protein Data Bank accession code “1BY2” as the key word, which led us to the SRCR superfamily data base. Consensus sequences of the SRCR domains in these proteins were calculated with DNAstar (17Bikker F.J. Ligtenberg A.J.M. Nazmi K. Veerman E.C.I. Van't Hof W. Bolscher J.G.M. Poustka A.

Fluotrac 600 microtiter plates (Greiner, Recklinghausen, Germany) were coated with various amounts of either synthetic peptides or purified DMBT1SAG. The peptides were dissolved in coating buffer (100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.6) to a starting concentration of 40 μg/ml and 2-fold serially diluted. After incubation at 4 °C for 16 h, the plates were washed twice with the relevant buffers. Subsequently, 100 μl of a bacterial suspension (5 × 108 bacteria/ml TTC) were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Plates were washed three times with the same buffer using a plate washer (Mikrotek EL 403, Winooski, VT). Bound bacteria were detected using 100 μl/well SYTO-9 solution (1 mm) (Molecular Probes), a cell permeating and DNA-binding fluorescent probe. Plates were incubated in the dark at the ambient temperature for 15 min and washed three times with the same buffer. Fluorescence was measured in a Fluostar Galaxy microtiter plate fluorescence reader (BMG Laboratories, Offenburg, Germany) at 488-nm excitation and 509-nm emission wavelengths. These experiments were repeated at least three times. Agglutination Assays—100 μl of a bacterial suspension (5 × 108 bacteria/ml) were mixed with 20 μl of peptide solution at final peptide concentrations of 0–200 μg/ml in 48-well microtiter plates (Falcon, Piscataway, NJ) and incubated at 37 °C for 5–15 min. Agglutination was scored visually. Turbidimetric analysis of the agglutination process was carried out with a UVICON 930 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments, Watford, United Kingdom) using 150 μm peptide as described earlier (17Bikker F.J.

These experiments were repeated at least three times. Determination of the Minimal Pathogen-binding Site of DMBT1—We have defined the precise binding site within SRCRP2 by testing the bacteria binding properties of a set of sequentially overlapping 16-mer peptides extending from residues 12–27 to 24–39 (SRCRP2 + 6N to SRCRP2 + 6C) of the SRCR domain consensus sequence (Fig. 1A). Only peptides 14–29 and 19–34 (SRCRP2 + 4N to SRCRP2 + C1) bound bacteria in the adhesion assay (Fig. 1B). Peptide 19–29, representing the shared motif within these peptides (19GRVEV-LYRGSW29), also bound to bacteria and was further referred to as DMBT1pbs1. Further truncation of this motif, either at the amino or the carboxyl terminus, yielded peptides without bacteria binding properties (Fig. 1C). Like SRCRP2 and the native DMBT1, DMBT1pbs1 bound to Gram-positive (S. mutans and S. gordonii) as well as to Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and H. pylori) (Fig. 2B). With SRCRP2, the agglutination of S. mutans was observed after ∼30 min, whereas with the corresponding concentrations of DMBT1pbs1 the agglutination of S. mutans was already observed after 2–3 min (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Comparison of SRCRP2- and DMBT1bps1-mediated bacterial agglutination.A, S. mutans suspension was mixed with SRCRP2, DMBT1pbs1 (both 150 μm) or control (Tris-buffered saline), and agglutination was recorded turbidimetrically at 700 nm. DMBT1pbs1-mediated agglutination was detected at 2–3 min, whereas SRCRP2-mediated agglutination was observed no sooner than after 20–30 min. B, DMBT1pbs1 mediated bacterial agglutination of S. gordonii (Gram-positive), and E. coli and H. pylori (Gram-negative) bacteria. DMBT1pbs1 agglutinates all three bacteria.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Determination of Essential Amino Acid Residues in DMBT1pbs1—To determine key residues in DMBT1pbs1 required for bacteria binding, a full alanine substitution scan was performed. A set of peptides was synthesized in which each residue across the DMBT1pbs1 peptide, in its turn, was substituted for alanine. This peptide set was tested in the adhesion assay (Fig. 3). Binding to S. mutans was strongly reduced by substitution of Val-3, Glu-4, Val-5, Leu-6, and Trp-11 (Fig. 3). Agglutination assays (not shown) confirmed the results of the adhesion assays. The Motif in the Carboxyl-terminal SRCR Domain of DMBT1 Is Functionally Distinct—The DMBT1pbs1 peptide is present in 10 of the 14 SRCR domains of DMBT1. To investigate the bacteria binding of the motifs present within the four remaining SRCR domains, the corresponding peptides were synthesized and tested. Only the SRCR14 peptide, in which five residues are different from the consensus sequence, did not bind to bacteria (Table I). Analysis of the Bacteria Binding Features of Motifs Present within Other Members of the SRCR Superfamily—Because SRCR domains are highly conserved across species, we investigated whether DMBT1pbs1-corresponding sequences in other SRCR proteins also exhibited bacteria binding. Using the Pfam (protein family) data base, 85 SRCR proteins were found containing altogether 301 SRCR domains. For each protein, the consensus sequence of its SRCR domains was determined, and the motif corresponding to DMBT1pbs1 was synthesized. In this way a representative number of 11-mer peptides covering the consensus sequences of 20 different SRCR proteins were tested for bacteria binding. Only the peptides derived from DMBT1 and DMBT1 orthologues such as mouse CRP-ductin, the rat Ebnerin, the rabbit Hensin, and the bovine gallbladder mucin, bound bacteria (Table I). In the present study we determined the minimal bacteria-binding site of DMBT1 and examined whether corresponding domains in other SRCR proteins also exhibit bacteria binding. By testing a set of overlapping peptides, the minimal bacteria-binding site was pinpointed as an 11-amino acid sequence, GRVEVLYRGSW, designated DMBT1pbs1. Alanine substitution of Val-3, Glu-4, Val-5, Leu-6, and Trp-11 resulted in a drastic decrease of bacteria binding. These residues are highly conserved within the 14 SRCR domains of DMBT1, the only difference being the presence of Ile-5 in domains 1 and 14. In previous studies, we have found that DMBT1SAG agglutinated bacteria in a calcium-dependent fashion (17Bikker F.J. Ligtenberg A.J.M. Nazmi K. Veerman E.C.I. Van't Hof W. Bolscher J.G.M. Poustka A. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Mollenhauer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32109-32115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We postulate that the critical role of Glu-4 and Trp-11 in bacteria binding reflects the Ca2+ chelation by their side chains. The sensitivity to Ala substitution of the three hydrophobic residues surrounding Glu-4 is less obvious in this model. As these substitutions have little effect on overall hydrophobicity, this sensitivity indicates that a proper fit is required for bacteria binding. This is corroborated by the finding that the replacement of Val-5 by the more similar Ile, as in the SRCR domain 1 peptide, has little if any effect (Table I). Analysis of the SRCR consensus domain using sequentially overlapping 16-mer peptides showed that peptides lacking Gly-1 were completely incapable of bacteria binding. Together with the conservation of this residue throughout the SRCR superfamily (Table I), this finding points to an essential role for this residue. Surprisingly, the substitution of Gly-1 by Ala had no effect. In terms of the above model, this result is explained by assuming that the introduction of a positively charged N terminus at Arg-2 by the omission of Gly-1 would lead to detrimental electronic repulsion. The absence of binding by the DMBT1pbs1 motif of SRCR domain 14 is not surprising, because this domain shows much less homology (60%) with the other 13 SRCR domains (87–100%) of DMBT1. Also, its location in the molecule within two CUB domains does not support a role in multivalent bacteria binding, which is probably fulfilled by the other SRCR domains. The DMBT1pbs1 11-mer peptide induced agglutination more rapidly than did the 16-mer SRCRP2 peptide (Fig. 2). This may be explained by the fact that SRCRP2 has a lower isoelectric point (pI = 8.22) than DMBT1pbs1 (pI = 8.75), resulting in a lower positive charge and thus a decreased affinity for the negatively charged bacterial surface. The first three amino acids (QGR) of the SRCRP2 16-mer peptide were homologous with the bacteria binding site on the SRCR domain of MARCO (RGR) (6Brännström A. Sankala M. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although both bacteria binding sites are located on the SRCR domains of the proteins, the results in this paper suggest different bacteria binding mechanisms. DMBT1pbs1 does not contain the QGR motif, and substitution of Arg-2 in DMBT1pbs1 did not result in the disappearance of binding. The positively charged RXR motif of MARCO suggests an electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged bacterial surface. In DMBT1pbs1, a negatively charged residue (E4) and the hydrophobic residues (Val-3, Val-5, Leu-6, and Trp-11) are important for bacteria binding. Binding studies with corresponding peptides of other SRCR consensus sequences showed that only highly homologous sequences, such as those present in DMBT1 orthologues, displayed bacteria binding (Table I). Strikingly, SRCR consensus sequences of some other proteins, including P. marinus Pema-SRCR, bovine WC1, and Plo2 of Perca flavescens, possessed the minimal bacteria binding motif but did not bind to bacteria. These results suggest that, in addition to the presence of the VEVLXXXXW motif, a proper three-dimensional folding of DMBT1pbs1 is quintessential for bacteria binding. For example, the replacement of Arg-8 by Ala will not influence the secondary structure, whereas replacement by Gly as in Pema-SRCR, resulting in a di-glycine motif, may favor the introduction of a β-turn. As Pema-SRCR still contains the critical VEVLXXXXW sequence, this observation suggests that Trp must have a proper orientation with respect to the VEVL stretch for bacteria binding. This sensitivity of DMBT1pbs1 to the substitution of seemingly non-critical residues underlines the need for whole proteins to be tested for conclusive results of bacteria binding. SRCR domains are present in proteins of all Metazoa. We studied the degree of conservation of the amino acids in SRCR domains by using hidden Markov model logos (37Schuster-Böckler B. Schultz J. Rahmann S. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/7)PubMed Google Scholar) (at logos.molgen.mpg.de/cgi-bin/logomat-m.cgi?pfamid) in combination with the Pfam (protein family) data base (www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF00530). This study revealed that Gly-1, Val-3, Glu-4, Val-5, and Trp-11 of DMBT1pbs1 are highly conserved along the whole SRCR superfamily, suggesting that these residues are important for the structure and function of SRCR domains. Despite the high degree of conservation, bacteria binding was only found for DMBT1 and its orthologues by this motif (Table I). These results suggest that less conserved residues, which seemed to be non-critical in the alanine substitution scan, were also important for bacteria binding. Because SRCR proteins are usually involved in different kinds of ligand binding (38Sarrias M.R. Grønlund J. Padilla O. Madsen J. Holmskov U. Lozano F. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 24: 1-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the conserved residues in DMBT1pbs1 may form a general ligand binding motif of SRCR proteins that, in DMBT1 orthologues, has developed into a bacteria binding motif. After studying the phylogenetic tree of the SRCR superfamily, Holmskov et al. identified P. marinus as the most primitive species with a DMBT1 orthologue (30Holmskov U. Mollenhauer J. Madsen J. Vitved L. Grønlund J. Tornøe I. Kliem A. Reid K.B. Poustka A. Skjødt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10794-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence of this protein possesses the DMBT1pbs1 binding motif, although no binding for this peptide was demonstrated (Table I). Next to the Pema-SRCR protein, DMBT1 orthologues have only been characterized in Mammalia, for example CRP-ductin/Vomeroglandin in the mouse, Ebnerin in the rat, Hensin in the rabbit, and bovine gallbladder mucin. It remains to be investigated whether DMBT1 orthologues are present in non-mammalian vertebrates and whether these proteins are involved in bacteria binding in vivo. In conclusion, we have narrowed down the minimal bacteria-binding site on the SRCR domains of DMBT1 to an 11-mer peptide, GRVEVLYRGSW, and we have identified a number of critical residues within this stretch. Despite considerable sequence similarities in this motif throughout the SRCR superfamily, bacteria binding by this motif is thus far restricted to DMBT1 orthologues."

Ligand binding to the C-terminal of GR promotes the nuclear translocation of the receptor and binding to NF-κB through the GR DNA binding domain. We sought how ligand recognition influences the interaction between NF-κB and GR. Both dexamethasone (agonist) and RU486 (antagonist) promote efficient nuclear translocation, and we show occupancy of the same intranuclear compartment as NF-κB with both ligands. However, unlike dexamethasone, RU486 had negligible activity to inhibit NF-κB transactivation. This failure may stem from altered co-factor recruitment or altered interaction with NF-κB. Using both glutathione S-transferase pull-down and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer approaches, we identified a major glucocorticoid ligand effect on interaction between the GR and the p65 component of NF-κB, with RU486 inhibiting recruitment compared with dexamethasone. Using the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay, we found that RU486 efficiently recruited NCoR to the GR, unlike dexamethasone, which recruited SRC1. Therefore, RU486 promotes differential protein recruitment to both the C-terminal and DNA binding domain of the receptor. Importantly, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that impaired interaction between GR and p65 with RU486 leads to reduced recruitment of the GR to the NF-κB-responsive region of the interleukin-8 promoter, again in contrast to dexamethasone that significantly increased GR binding. We demonstrate that ligand-induced conformation of the GR C-terminal has profound effects on the functional surface generated by the DNA binding domain of the GR.

The anti-inflammatory activities of GCs are caused, in part, by transrepression of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. The GR has distinct functional domains, an N-terminal transactivation domain (AF-1), a central DNA binding domain (DBD), and a C-terminal domain that includes ligand binding (LBD) and transactivation activities (AF-2) (1Hollenberg S.M.

However, although the domains can function separately, there is evidence for functional interdependence within the intact GR, which may be necessary for authentic activity (4Hittelman A.B. Burakov D.

This leads to the recruitment of co-repressors, such as NCoR, and not co-activators, such as SRC1, which are recruited to the agonist bound GR (12Stevens A. Garside H. Berry A. Waters C. White A.

However, the effects of these ligand-induced conformational changes on the function of the DNA binding domain have not been fully explored. The mechanism of NF-κB repression by GR has yet to be fully defined, but it is known that GR and the p65 subunit of NF-κB physically interact (14Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de S.A.

GR repression of p65 requires the LBD, in addition to the DBD (19McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A repressor protein or complex, recruited to the tethered GR, has been proposed, with evidence implicating GRIP-1, a member of the p160 family (18Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R.

However, it is not clear if functional differences between agonist and antagonist are due to defective interaction with NF-κB or subsequent defective recruitment of the co-repressor protein. The function of the GR DBD has been thought to be independent of the LBD, but RU486 causes subtle alteration of DNA binding kinetics for the GR compared with dexamethasone (22Pandit S. Geissler W. Harris G. Sitlani A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this paper, we explore the influence of ligand on functional interactions between the ligand binding domain and DNA binding domain of the GR. Improved understanding of how GR interaction with p65 occurs and how this can be modulated by ligand has major implications for effective drug design and screening. Here we describe a previously unsuspected role for the GR LBD in regulating recruitment of NF-κB to the GR DNA binding domain. Plasmids—The NRE-luc plasmid consists of three copies of the ICAM1 promoter NF-κB response elements (NREs) upstream of the luciferase gene; it responds to p65 homodimers and has been previously described (27Sheppard K.A. Phelps K.M. Williams A.J. Thanos D. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29291-29294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The p65 RHD was amplified using the HF2 PCR kit (Clontech) and inserted into the pGEX-5X-3 fusion protein expression plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) to give pGST-RHD. The specific primers had BamHI and NotI restriction enzyme sites added for ligation into the vector (forward primer for GST-RHD, 5′-GGATCCTGGACGAACTGTTCCCCCTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCGGCCGCCTTGAAGGTCTCATATGTCCTTTTACG-3′). Full-length p65 was subcloned from p65-GFP into the pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech) using HindIII and BamHI restriction sites. The p65-GFP vector was kindly donated by Dr. Mike White and has been previously described (23Nelson G. Paraoan L. Spiller D.G. Wilde G.J. Browne M.A. Djali P.K. Unitt J.F. Sullivan E. Floettmann E. White M.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SRC1-RID and NCoR-RID were amplified using the HF2 PCR kit (Clontech) and inserted into pEYFP-N1 or pEYFP-C1 vectors, respectively. The specific primers had EcoRI and KpnI restriction enzyme sites added for ligation into the vector (forward primer for SRC1-RID-EYFP, 5′-GGAATTCTACCTAGCAGATTAAATATACAACCA-3′; reverse primer, 5′ GGGGGTACCAGCGTGGGCAGTAACTGATC-3′; forward primer for EYFP-NCoR-RID, 5′-GGGGAATTCCACTTATATTCCTGGTACAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGTGGTACCGTCATCACTATCCGACAG-3′). The Rluc:GR, GR:Rluc, GFP2-p65, and p65-GFP2 plasmids were made by BioSignal Packard Inc. (Cambridge, UK). For the construction of GR:Rluc, the GR coding sequence was amplified from pECFP-GR (forward primer, 5′-CGGATATCGCCACCATGGACTCCAAAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCGCCTAGGGAAAACTACTTTGTCTTCAAAAAAC-3′) and ligated into pCR Blunt II TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate pCR/GR (minus STOP); then a restriction fragment bearing GR-coding sequences (without the STOP codon) was excised from pCR/GR using EcoRV and BamHI and ligated into p(h)Rluc-N2(FG)Kan (Biosignal Packard). For the construction of Rluc:GR plasmid, the GR coding sequence was amplified from pECFP-GR (forward primer, 5′-CGCTCGAGGACTCCAAAGAATCATTAACTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTTCTGTTTCATCAAAAGTGAGGTACCGC-3′) and ligated into pCR Blunt II TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate pCR/GR (minus START); then a restriction fragment bearing GR coding sequences (without the START codon) was excised from pCR/GR using XhoI and KpnI and ligated into p(h)Rluc-C2(FG)Kan (Biosignal Packard). In order to obtain the p65 coding sequence devoid of either the START or STOP codon, two PCRs were performed using the appropriate pairs of primers: 1) forward primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGGACGAACTGTTCCCCCTCATC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTGAGTCAGATCAGCTCCTAAAAGCTTGGG-3′) for p65 minus START; 2) forward primer (5′-CCCAAGCTTATGGACGAACTGTTCCCCCTCAT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CCTGCTGAGTCAGATCAGCTCCGGATCCGCG-3′) for p65 minus STOP. For the construct encoding the p65:GFP2 fusion protein, the enzymes used were HindIII and BamHI, and the recipient vector was pGFP21-C1(FG)Zeo (Biosignal Packard). Similarly, the construct encoding the GFP2:p65 fusion protein was obtained by using XhoI and HindIII, and the recipient vector was pGFP21-N2(FG)Zeo (Biosignal Packard). The pcDNA3-GR plasmid containing full-length wild type GR has been previously described (12Stevens A. Garside H. Berry A. Waters C. White A. Ray D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The human GR DNA binding domain/ligand binding domain (DBD/LBD) between codons 289 and 777 was amplified from pcDNA3-GR using the HF2 PCR kit and inserted into the pACT plasmid (Promega Corp. Southampton, UK) to give VP16-DBD/LBD. The specific primers had BamHI and NotI restriction enzyme sites added for ligation into the vector (forward primer for VP16-DBD/LBD, 5′-GGATCCCTGGGGTAATTAAGCAAGAGAAACTGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCGGCCGCCTTTTGATGAAACAGAAGTTTTTTG-3′). The CMV-Renilla plasmid (pRL-CMV) was obtained from Promega and has been previously described (12Stevens A. Garside H. Berry A. Waters C. White A. Ray D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All plasmid constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the predicted changes and to exclude introduction of errors. Interaction of p65-RHD and the Glucocorticoid Receptor in Vitro— Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and GST-RHD fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) and were purified as described (29Widen C. Gustafsson J.A. Wikstrom A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 50-ml culture of the expression vector was stimulated with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) and grown for 3 h. The bacteria were then pelleted and resuspended in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (“Complete”; Roche Applied Science). The bacteria were treated with lysozyme (100 μg/ml) for 15 min at 4 °C and then disrupted using a 50-watt, 20-kHz sonicator (Jencons, Leighton Buzzard, UK) on full power for 5 × 30 s. The samples were then centrifuged to remove the debris, and glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the supernatant. The fusion proteins were allowed to bind to the beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in NETN plus protease inhibitors and stored at 4 °C. 35S-Labeled GR was synthesized using the TNT kit (Promega) following the manufacturer instructions with the full-length, human GR cDNA in pcDNA3 or VP16-DBD/LBD as template, with no ligand, 10 μm Dex, or 10 μm RU486 and [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled GR was incubated with the GST proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in NETN, and boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer eluted the bound proteins. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained in Sypro Red to visualize the GST fusion proteins. The 35S-labeled GR was then visualized by exposure of the gel to a phosphor imaging plate (BasIII; Fuji). The Sypro Red-stained acrylamide gels were analyzed under UV light (AlphaImager 2000; Flowgen, Lichfield, UK). The amount of radiolabeled protein present on the gel was quantitated using a phosphor imager (BAS1800; FujiFilm) and Aida 2.0 analysis software (Raytest, GMBH). Transrepression Assay—COS7 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells into 24-well plates and were transfected with 2.4 μg of NRE-luc and 1.2 μg of GR construct (pcDNA3-GR or VP16-DBD/LBD) and 7.5 ng of GAL4-p65. Cell lysates were subjected to both firefly and Renilla luciferase assays; firefly luciferase was then corrected for Renilla luciferase expression as previously described (12Stevens A. Garside H. Berry A. Waters C. White A. Ray D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)2 Assay—The day before transfection, HEK 293T cells were seeded at 3 × 106 cells/10-cm tissue culture dish containing DMEM, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. On the day of transfection, the medium was replaced by growth medium supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with GR fused to Renilla luciferase at the C or N terminus and p65 fused to GFP2 at the C or N terminus using RenLuc-GFP2 at different ratios (4:1, 4:4, 1:4, and 0.5:4). As a negative control for interaction, GR-RenLuc was also cotransfected with GFP2-KaiB plasmid. 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested using Versene (PBS and 0.5 mm EDTA); centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm, resuspended in BRET buffer, Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma, Poole, UK); and counted. Cells were recentrifuged and resuspended in BRET buffer to a cell density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml. 5 × 104 cells were added to each well of a 96-well shallow Optiplate (PerkinElmer BioSignal Inc.) followed by stimuli diluted in BRET buffer so that the final concentrations were 1 μm dexamethasone and 10 ng/ml TNF-α. The treatment was performed at room temperature for 1 h. Triplicate determinations for each condition were prepared. After incubation, the luminescence reaction was started by adding 10 μl of the substrate DeepBlueC™ coelenterazine (PerkinElmer BioSignal), to give a final concentration of 5 μm; plates were read after 20 min on a Fusion Universal Microplate Analyzer (PerkinElmer BioSignal) using the following filter settings: 410 nm for luciferase emission and 515 nm for enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) emission. After subtraction of the average counts obtained with untransfected cells from the readings of individual wells, the BRET2 signal was determined as the ratio between GFP2 emission (515 nm) and Renilla luciferase emission (410 nm). BRET1 Assay—The day before transfection, HEK 293T cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells per 10-cm tissue culture dish containing DMEM, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using Fugene 6 transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). The medium on the cells was replaced with 10 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen). The transfection solution containing a 1:5 DNA/Fugene ratio, using 150 μl of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium, 30 μl of Fugene, and 6 μg of total DNA, was then added on the cells after 20 min at room temperature. Cells were cotransfected with C-terminal tagged GR-Renilla and the other protein encoding cDNA fused to EYFP (p65, SRC1, or NCoR) at a ratio of 1:4, 1:4, and 1:8, respectively. After 4 h, medium was replaced by DMEM, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested, resuspended in BRET buffer, and seeded in 96-well plates as for the BRET2 assay. Cells were then treated with GR ligands diluted in BRET buffer so that the final concentration range was between 0.01 and 1000 nm. The incubation was performed at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 1 h. Triplicate determinations for each condition were prepared. After incubation, the luminescence reaction was started by adding 10 μl of the substrate coelenterazine, to give a final concentration of 5 μm, and plates were read after 15 min on a Fusion Universal Microplate Analyzer (Packard BioScience, Pangbourne, UK) using the following filter settings: 485 nm for luciferase emission and 535 nm for EYFP emission. The BRET ratio was then corrected for the BRET signal obtained from cells transfected with the Renilla-fused protein alone (Ren) determined as follows: BRET ratio = (emission 535 nm-emission 485 nm × cf)/emission 485 nm, where cf = emission 535 nm Renilla alone/emission 485 nm Renilla alone. Curves were then constructed, and EC50 values were calculated using a four-parameter curve fit. IL-8 ELISA—HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal calf serum (Hyclone) for 48 h. Cell-conditioned medium was then collected from HeLa cells treated with 0.5 ng/ml TNF-α, and a dose response of either Dex or RU486 (1–1000 μm) for 16 h. IL-8 concentration was measured using an IL-8 ELISA kit (R & D Systems), following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence of Endogenous Protein—HeLa cells were seeded into each well of 8-chamber slides at 30,000 cells/chamber using DMEM supplemented with Glutamax-1 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and 3% charcoal/dextran-stripped serum. 24 h later, the cells were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and either 100 nm Dex or 100 nm RU486 for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. After fixing, cells were washed three times with TD buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) and treated with blocking buffer (TD plus 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature. A 1:200 dilution of primary antibody, P20 sc-1002 for the GR, sc-109-G for p65 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in washing buffer (TD plus 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100), was added for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with wash buffer, and a 1:200 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 568 rabbit anti-goat IgG) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in washing buffer was added for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times and mounted on slides using Citifluor (glycerol/PBS) (Citifluor Ltd.). Coverslips were sealed and stored at 4 °C. Images were taken using a Leica TCS-4D confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) using a ×63 water immersion objective. To visualize Alexa 488, cells were excited at 488 nm using an argon laser, and emission was collected using a band pass filter of 525 ± 25 nm and a dichroic beam splitter of 500. Alexa 568 cells were viewed using an excitation filter of 568 nm, and emission was collected using a 590-nm long pass filter. Immunofluorescence of Overexpressed YFP Constructs—HeLa cells were pelleted, resuspended in medium supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped serum (Hyclone), and seeded onto 22-mm glass coverslips at a density of 3 × 105 cells/slide. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of either p65-EYFP, SRC1-RID-EYFP, or EYFP-NCoR-RID using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 24 h post-transfection, cells were visualized on a Leica TCS-4D confocal microscope, using a × 63 water immersion objective. Cells were excited with an argon laser at 488 nm, and emission was collected using a band pass filter of 525 ± 25 nm. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were cultured for 3 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) to 95% confluence in T75 flasks (∼ 5 × 106 cells). Cells were treated with vehicle, TNF-α (10 ng/ml), or TNF-α and GR ligand (1 μm) for 2 h and then washed twice with PBS. 1% formaldehyde was then added, and cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Glycine (final concentration 0.125 m) was then added for 5 min to quench the formaldehyde. The protocol described by Shang et al. (24Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) was then followed. Briefly, cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected into 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.4), 10 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g. Cells were then sequentially washed with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, buffer I (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5), and buffer II (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5). Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and sonicated three times for 30 s each at the half-power setting (Jencons) followed by centrifugation for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and made up to 1 ml in lysis buffer, and 100 μl was set aside to represent input. The input sample was heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the cross-links, and then DNA was extracted using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). The remaining supernatant was immunocleared with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 20 μl of preimmune serum, and 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C, using either 2.5 μg of GR M20 or 2 μg of p65 sc-109 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After immunoprecipitation, 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA were added, and the incubation was continued for another 2 h. Precipitates were then washed sequentially for 10 min each in TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Precipitates were then washed three times with TE buffer and extracted twice with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Eluates were pooled and heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA fragments were purified using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). Following DNA extraction, real time quantitative PCR was performed (Stratagene M3000), using the SYBR Green master mix (Sigma), 0.4 μm primers for promoter regions of the IL-8 and U6SnRNA genes, which have been previously described (18Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2314-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) (IL-8 promoter region –121/+61, forward (5′-GGGCCATCAGTTGCAAATC-3′) and reverse (5′-TTCCTTCCGGTGGTTTCTTC-3′); U6SnRNA promoter region –248/+85, forward (5′-GGCCTATTTCCCATGATTCC-3′) and reverse (5′-ATTTGCGTGTCATCCTTGC-3′) and 5 μl of extracted DNA product. Amounts of DNA precipitated in each experiment were calculated by comparison with standard curve values obtained from amplification reactions carried out with serial dilutions of genomic DNA. These values were then corrected for the amount of DNA precipitated from the IgG control and the amount of DNA present in the input sample. To control the specificity of the amplification and to ensure that only one product was generated, products were examined with both a dissociation curve program and by gel electrophoresis. Statistics—Where appropriate, data were analyzed using analysis of variance followed by the Bonferoni post hoc test. Dexamethasone but Not RU486 Repressed IL-8 Production—To investigate the ability of GR ligands to repress p65-mediated transactivation, HeLa cells were treated for 16 h with TNF-α (0.5 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of steroid. IL-8 was measured in cell-conditioned medium by ELISA. TNF-α treatment increased IL-8 concentration 6.5-fold; this was significantly suppressed by Dex. In contrast, RU486 did not significantly repress IL-8 secretion (Fig. 1). Co-localization of GR and NF-κB p65 in Glucocorticoidtreated Cells—Both Dex and RU486 allow GR translocation, and both promote DNA binding (22Pandit S. Geissler W. Harris G. Sitlani A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2069696766,"The high affinity IgE Fc receptor (FcϵRI) β chain functions as a signal amplifier and has been linked to atopy, asthma, and allergy. Herein, we report on a previously unrecognized negative regulatory role for the nonconventional β chain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif that contains three tyrosine residues (YX5YX3Y). Degranulation and leukotriene production was found to be impaired in cells expressing the mutated FcϵRIβ immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs FYY, YYF, FYF, and FFF. In contrast, cytokine synthesis and secretion were enhanced in the YFY and FFF mutants. FcϵRI phosphorylation and Lyn kinase co-immunoprecipitation was intact in the YFY mutant but was lost in the FYF and FFF mutants. The phosphorylation of Syk, LAT, phospholipase γ1/2, and Srchomology 2 domain-containing protein phosphatase 2 was intact, whereas the phosphorylation of SHIP-1 was significantly reduced in the YFY mutant cells. The FYF and FFF mutants were defective in phosphorylating all of these molecules. In contrast, the phosphorylation of ERK, p38 MAPK, IκB kinase β (IKKβ), and nuclear NFκB activity was enhanced in the YFY and FFF mutants.

Matthews S.A. Turner H. Kinet J.-P. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 325-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aggregation of FcϵRI by the interaction of bound IgE with multivalent antigens induces the release of histamine, leukotrienes, and inflammatory cytokines, resulting in the recruitment and activation of circulating leukocytes leading to allergic inflammation (2Blank U. Rivera J. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 266-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Polymorphisms in the FcϵRIβ have been linked to atopy, asthma, and allergy (3Shirakawa T. Li A. Dubowitz M. Dekker J.W. Shaw A.E. Faux J.A. Ra C. Cookson W.O.C.M. Hopkin J.M. Nat.

However, studies on the role of these polymorphisms in FcϵRI expression and function have not yielded an understanding of their effects on mast cell physiology (6Furumoto Y. Hiraoka S. Kawamoto K.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 3917-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is clear that the FcϵRIβ functions as a signal amplifier in mast cells and is important for augmenting the allergic reactions (8Lin S. Cicala C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.-P. Cell. 1996; 85: 985-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9Dombrowicz D. Lin S.Q. Flamand V. Brini A.T. Koller B.H. Kinet J.-P.

In humans, it has been demonstrated that the γ homodimer can act as an autonomous signaling molecule in various cell types, whereas the β subunit amplifies early activation signals by 5-7-fold through FcϵRI (reviewed in Ref. 1Nadler M.J. Matthews S.A. Turner H. Kinet J.-P. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 325-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the β chain also enhances cell-surface expression of FcϵRI (11Donnadieu E. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.-P. Immunity. 2000; 12: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), providing increased sensitivity in an allergic response. The β- and γ-chains contain ITAMs, a conserved feature of many antigen receptors that imparts signaling competence. The ITAM consensus sequence is (D/E)XXYXXLX7-11-YXXL(L/I), where the tyrosine residues are phosphoacceptor sites for the action of receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Ref. 1Nadler M.J. Matthews S.A. Turner H. Kinet J.-P. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 325-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-ITAMs provide a docking site for cytoplasmic proteins that contain the Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain. Some of these function to couple receptors to macromolecular signaling complexes anchored by adapter proteins (12Rivera J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which serve to coordinate and amplify intracellular signals. The structure of the β and γ chain ITAMs differ. In particular, the β chain ITAM shows a notable departure from the consensus ITAM sequence with the presence of a third tyrosine (the middle tyrosine) between the two canonical tyrosine residues and a shorter spacer region between the canonical tyrosines. The Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn weakly binds to β chain ITAM in resting cells and is further recruited after the receptor aggregation (13Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 14Yamashita T. Mao S.-Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24072-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Lyn is required for the initial step of activation by phosphorylating FcϵRI specifically on the β and γ ITAMs (16Paolini R. Jouvin M.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 17Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although the requirements for this initial event are not fully understood, it appears that the protein-protein interaction of Lyn with FcϵRI and an appropriate lipid microenvironment, where this interaction may be enhanced, are probably prerequisites (18Vonakis B.M. Haleem-Smith H. Benjamin P. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Kovarova M. Tolar P. Arudchandran R. Draberova L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Recently, we described that another Src family protein tyrosine kinase Fyn was also activated by and co-immunoprecipitated with the FcϵRI (21Parravicini V. Gadina M. Kovarova M. Odom S. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Furumoto Y. Saitoh S. Samelson L.E. O'Shea J.J. Rivera J. Nature Immunology. 2002; 3: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This kinase initiates a complementary signaling pathway that is anchored by the adapter molecule Gab2 (Grb2-associated binder protein 2) whose phosphorylation is critical for activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) and for membrane targeting of the SH2 domain-containing protein phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) (22Gu H. Saito K. Klaman L.D. Shen J. Fleming T. Wang Y. Pratt J.C. Lin G. Lim B. Kinet J.-P. Neel B.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, because the requirements for FcϵRI-dependent Fyn activation are yet unclear, in this study, we focused on testing the role of the FcϵRIβ ITAM tyrosines in Lyn-dependent activation of mast cell responses. This focus was based on the recent finding that Lyn kinase is a negative regulator of mast cell responsiveness and the allergic response (23Odom S. Gomez G. Kovarova M. Furumoto Y. Ryan J.J. Wright H.V. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Hibbs M.L. Harder K.W. Rivera J. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), thus raising the possibility that its interaction with FcϵRIβ could exert negative regulatory influences. Because bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMMC) from β chain-deficient mice lack cell surface expression of FcϵRI despite normal expression of FcϵRI α and γ chain mRNA, we chose this system to retrovirally transduce mutant β chains that reconstituted cell surface FcϵRI. Most mutant FcϵRIβ-expressing cells showed impaired degranulation and leukotriene secretion when compared with wild type FcϵRIβ-expressing cells. The YFY mutant was an exception, as it showed no inhibition of these responses. Strikingly, cytokine synthesis and secretion was increased in YFY mutant cells and was greatly enhanced in the FFF mutant. The increased cytokine production was associated with increased activation of the gene transcription regulators, MAPKs, and NFκB. Whereas a positive role for the FcϵRI β chain in allergic responses has been rigorously demonstrated (reviewed in Ref. 1Nadler M.J. Matthews S.A. Turner H. Kinet J.-P. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 325-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our findings revealed a previously unrecognized negative regulatory role for the FcϵRIβ ITAM in cytokine production. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-rat β monoclonal Ab (clone JRK), which also recognizes mouse β chain (24Rivera J. Kinet J.-P. Kim J. Pucillo C. Metzger H. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 647-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), was used in these studies. Mouse monoclonal Abs to IgE (anti-TNP or anti-DNP) were also used (25Liu F.T. Bohn J.W. Ferry E.L. Yamamoto H. Molinaro C.A. Sherman L.A. Klinman N.R. Katz D.H. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 2728-2737PubMed Google Scholar). IgE was labeled with FITC (Sigma). Mouse monoclonal Abs to SHP-2 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Recombinant murine stem cell factor and interleukin-3 (IL-3) were kindly gifted by Kirin Brewery Co. (Tokyo, Japan) or were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Polyclonal Abs to PI3K and SHIP and a biotinylated monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) were from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal Abs to Lyn and PLCγ1 and monoclonal antibody to PLCγ2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal Abs to Syk were kindly provided by U. Blank (Institute Pasteur, Paris, France) and P. Draber (Institute of Molecular Genetics, Prague, Czechoslovakia), respectively. Polyclonal Ab to LAT was generously gifted by L. E. Samelson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All of the phosphospecific Abs were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) as well as antibodies to IKKα/β and IκB. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated extravidin and monoclonal anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (clone RG16) were from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to mouse and rabbit immunoglobulin were from Amersham Biosciences. Detergents (Nonidet P-40 and octyl glucoside) were from Pierce. Phosphatase and proteinase inhibitors were from Sigma. NaF was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Mice—The β chain-deficient (β-/-) mice on the chimeric BDF1 and 129 background have been described previously (10Hiraoka S. Furumoto Y. Koseki H. Takagaki Y. Taniguchi M. Okumura K. Ra C. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and were bred in the animal facility under specific pathogen-free conditions. BMMCs from β+/+ mice from the same background as β-/- mice were used as controls. For some experiments, BMMCs from these mice were kindly provided by Drs. Toshiaki and Yuko Kawakami (La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology). Cell Culture and Retroviral Gene Transduction—Bone marrow was harvested from mice femurs, and BMMCs were cultured as described previously (26Saitoh S. Arudchandran R. Manetz T.S. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Love P.E. Rivera J. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2000; 12: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). After 4-weeks of culture, cells were stained for cell surface expression of c-kit and/or FcϵRI and used for experiments when >95% cells showed mast cell markers. For retroviral gene transduction, bone marrow cells were grown for 8-10 days in the presence of IL-3 before co-culturing with a mixture of the ecotropic retrovirus-packaging cell lines, Phoenix and BOSC. After 2 days of co-culture, BMMC were recovered by centrifugation and antibiotic selection (puromycin) was initiated as described previously (27Saitoh S. Odom S. Gomez G. Sommers C.L. Young H.A. Rivera J. Samelson L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After 2 weeks of selection, cells were analyzed for FcϵRI expression. Cultures were used when >95% cells expressed FcϵRI. Site-specific Mutagenesis and Retroviral Constructs—The PCR-based mutagenesis described by M. P. Weiner et al. (28Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) was employed to create single nucleotide-mutagenized constructs. The 800-bp EcoRI fragment containing the mouse β chain coding sequence was isolated and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Two sets of PCR primers, including the mutation site, were designed in the opposite direction of the mutation site. The sequences of sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers for each mutagenesis were as follows: wild type, 5′-G TAT TCA CCA ATT TAC AGT GAG TT-3′ and 5′-AC ATT TAA TTC TTC ATA AAG ACG AT-3′; FYY, 5′-G TAT TCA CCA ATT TAC AGT GAG TT-3′ and 5′-AC ATT TAA TTC TTC AAA AAG ACG AT-3′; YFY, 5′-G TTT TCA CCA ATT TAC AGT GAG TT-3′ and 5′-AC ATT TAA TTC TTC ATA AAG ACG AT-3′; YYF, 5′-G TAT TCA CCA ATT TTC AGT GAG TT-3′ and 5′-AC ATT TAA TTC TTC ATA AAG ACG AT-3′; FYF, 5′-G TAT TCA CCA ATT TTC AGT GAG TT-3′ and 5′-AC ATT TAA TTC TTC AAA AAG ACG AT-3′; and FFF, 5′-G TTT TCA CCA ATT TTC AGT GAG TT-3′ and 5′-AC ATT TAA TTC TTC AAA AAG ACG AT-3′ (mutation sites with amino acid replacement of tyrosine to phenylalanine are underlined). PCR was carried out by using 2.5 units of Thermococcus kodakaraensis polymerase (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 10 ng of pBluescript as template, 50 pm of each phosphorylated primer, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 120 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 10 mm KCl, 6 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 μg/ml BSA). Amplified samples were denatured at 94 °C for 4 min before 25 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min) followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were treated with DpnI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to digest the template DNA followed by self-ligation. The integrity of all of the mutants was confirmed by sequence analysis using capillary sequencer (ABI prism 310 Genetic Analyzer, ABI, Foster City, CA). The mutant β chain cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector, pMX-puro, and the virus was produced (29Kitamura T. Int. J. Hematol. 1998; 67: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Empty vector (pMX-puro) was used as a negative control to generate the virus not expressing the FcϵRIβ. Flow Cytometry—The cells (3 × 105) were incubated with 5 μg/ml FITC-labeled IgE on ice for 30 min in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide. The cell surface fluorescence intensity was measured using a flow cytometer (FACScanR, BD Biosciences). The number of dead cells was determined by propidium iodide staining. β-Hexosaminidase Release Assay—Degranulation via FcϵRI stimulation was determined by β-hexosaminidase release. Cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with TNP or DNP-specific IgE (2 μg/ml) in Mg2+ and Ca2+-free Tyrode's buffer (10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, and 0.1% BSA) for 30 min at 4 °C. The sensitized cells were washed and resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml in Tyrode's buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.6 mm MgCl2. TNP-ovalbumin (1 ng/ml) or DNP-BSA (10 ng/ml) was used for maximal stimulation or at indicated concentrations. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin (100 ng/ml) were employed for pharmacological stimulation as positive control. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by centrifugation at 4 °C. The total hexosaminidase concentration was obtained by cell lysis in 1% Nonidet P-40. Aliquots of the supernatants and total cell lysates were incubated with 1.3 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma) in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) for 90 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2 m glycine buffer (pH 10.7). The release of the product 4-p-nitrophenol was monitored by optical absorbance at 405 nm. Percentage of β-hexosaminidase release was calculated as follows: (supernatant optical density value of the stimulated cells - supernatant optical density value of the unstimulated cells) × 100/(the total cell lysate optical density value - supernatant optical density value of the unstimulated cells). Percent spontaneous release was usually below 5%. Cytokine, LTC4, NFκB Activity, and Real-time PCR—Cell culture supernatants after stimulation were analyzed for IL-6, IL-13, TNFα, and LTC4 by specific ELISA kits according to the manufacturers' instruction (Genzyme Techne, Minneapolis, MN or BIOSOURCE International for IL-6, IL-13, and TNFα, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI for LTC4). Cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) sensitized with IgE (2 μg/ml) were stimulated with antigen for 3 h at 37 °C, and supernatants collected and analyzed. NFκB binding activity was determined by measuring p65 binding to a NFκB consensus binding site oligonucleotide in an ELISA-based format according to the manufacturers' instructions (TransAM™ NFκB family, Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Nuclear lysates (prepared per manufacturers' instruction) of stimulated and nonstimulated (as above) cells expressing the YYY, YFY, FYF, and FFF ITAMs were incubated in ELISA wells containing the NFκB consensus binding site oligonucleotide. Binding was measured by incubation with a primary antibody to p65 followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody that recognized the primary antibody. Following a final step of multiple washes, a colorimetric reaction was performed. The positive control of stimulated Jurkat T cells and negative lysis buffer controls were also included. Absorbance was read at 450 nm. For analysis of mRNA levels, RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Valencia, CA) and reverse-transcribed using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR (TaqMan) was performed using the ABI PRISM7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). An analysis of IL-6, TNFα, and 18 S rRNA levels was performed using commercially available primer/probe sets (Applied Biosystems). Levels of IL-6 and TNFα were determined by normalization of 18 S rRNA levels relative to the unstimulated transduced cell line, which was arbitrarily designated a value of 1.0. Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Phospho-ITAM Peptide Pull-down Assays—Cell aliquots of 3 × 107 were stimulated in a total volume of 1 ml of Tyrode buffer and sampled at different times or stimulated with 100 ng/ml antigen. Stimulated cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in either SDS sample buffer or borate-buffered saline that contained 1% Nonidet P-40, 60 mm octyl glucoside, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min (4 °C) at 14,000 rpm. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated for 3 h with antibodies prebound to either protein G-Sepharose (monoclonal) or protein A-Sepharose (polyclonal). Proteins were recovered by denaturation with an equal volume of 2× Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer that contained 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm orthovanadate and were resolved by 8, 10, or 12% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). Nonreducing (lacking 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) SDS-PAGE was used for resolving FcϵRI immunoprecipitates to avoid masking of the receptor subunits by immunoglobulin heavy and light chains in Western blots. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (from Invitrogen or Schleicher & Schuell). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with either 4% BSA or 5% dry milk (depending on the primary antibody) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. They were then probed with the desired primary antibody and an appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. To confirm and extend co-immunoprecipitation experiments for proteins interacting with FcϵRIβ ITAM, pull-down assays were employed using biotinylated phospho-ITAM peptides (pY-pY-pY, pY-Y-pY, Y-pY-Y, YYY; AC Scientific, Duluth, GA), equivalent to YYY, YFY, FYF, and FFF, bound to streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Fluka Biochemika, Switzerland). For these experiments, peptide-containing beads were incubated with cell lysates prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.05% NaN3, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm Na3VO4) from IgE/Ag-activated or nonactivated BMMC for 3 h at 4 °C. Bead pellets were recovered by microcentrifugation and washed 3× with radioimmune precipitation assay, and bound proteins were recovered by extraction in SDS sample buffer. Recovered proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred as above for immunoblotting. No differences in protein interactions with the FcϵRIβ ITAM were noted when stimulated or nonstimulated cell lysates were used. Calcium Measurements—Calcium was measured as described previously (26Saitoh S. Arudchandran R. Manetz T.S. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Love P.E. Rivera J. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2000; 12: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106) were dual-loaded with 16 μm Fluo-4-AM and 16 μm Fura Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in RPMI 1640, 2% fetal calf serum media for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with IgE (1 μg/106 cells) on ice for 1 h and brought to room temperature for 20 min. Cells were resuspended in Tyrode-BSA, and changes in dye fluorescence with time were determined by flow cytometry after stimulation with 30 ng/ml antigen at 37 °C. Calcium mobilization was reported as the ratio of Fluo-4 to Fura Red fluorescence intensity over time. Statistical Analysis—A nonparametric test (Mann-Whitney) was employed to determine the statistical significance among the experimental groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Expression of Wild Type and Mutant Forms of FcϵRIβ in BMMC from β Chain-deficient Mice Reconstitutes Cell Surface Expression of FcϵRI—To investigate the functional significance of canonical and noncanonical tyrosine of the β chain ITAM in mast cell responses, we generated five mutants of the β chain with the replacement of tyrosine to phenylalanine in which the YYY (N-terminal to C-terminal sequence) was changed to YYF, YFY, FYY, FYF, and FFF. Retroviral-mediated gene transfer into β-/- mouse mast cells and cell surface expression analysis of FcϵRI revealed that cells expressing the YYF, YFY, FYY, FYF, and FFF were all FcϵRI-positive on their cell surface (>95%), similar to cells transduced with the wild type (YYY) ITAM virus, whereas cells transduced with the empty vector (pMX-puro) virus did not express FcϵRI, similar to β-/- mast cells (Fig. 1A). The relative fluorescence intensities of FcϵRI for each transduced cell culture were almost identical. The cells were shown to express FcϵRIβ protein by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody to β chain (Fig. 1B). The 31-kDa band, which corresponds to the β chain, in YYF, YFY, FYY, FYF, FFF, and wild type (YYY) cells was easily detected, whereas no protein band was observed in cells transduced with the vector-control virus (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the level of protein expression was similar to nontransduced BMMC. These results show that the mutated β chain ITAM successfully reconstituted FcϵRI cell surface expression to the same extent as wild type ITAM, and expression levels were comparable among the transduced cells. Mutation of the FcϵRI β ITAM Canonical Tyrosines but Not the Noncanonical Tyrosine Partly Impairs Mast Cell Degranulation and LTC4 Secretion—We investigated whether the expression of the different mutant β chains affected the degranulation and LTC4 secretion responses of the transduced mast cells upon FcϵRI stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2A, all of the cells expressing surface FcϵRI with wild type or mutant β chains, but not pMX-puro-transduced cells, were able to degranulate in response to FcϵRI stimulation. Cells expressing the FYY, YYF, FYF, and FFF forms of the β chain ITAM showed a 30-50% reduction in mast cell degranulation and LTC4 secretion (Fig. 2B) when compared with wild type ITAM-transduced cells (YYY) or wild type BMMC (data not shown). This is consistent with the previously described amplifying function of FcϵRIβ on mast cell degranulation (9Dombrowicz D. Lin S.Q. Flamand V. Brini A.T. Koller B.H. Kinet J.-P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the degranulation or LTC4 response of the YFY mutant when compared with wild type ITAM-transduced cells or BMMC, suggesting that the noncanonical tyrosine does not contribute to FcϵRIβ-mediated amplification. FcϵRI-mediated Cytokine Production and Secretion Is Dramatically Enhanced in the Absence of FcϵRI β ITAM Tyrosines—IgE-dependent activation of mast cells leads to de novo synthesis and secretion of cytokines (30Gordon J.R. Hamawy M.M. IgE receptor (FceRI) Function in Mast Cells and Basophils. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 209-242Google Scholar). We investigated whether mutations of the β chain ITAM would influence the cytokine secretion from mast cells. Because IL-6, IL-13, and TNFα are cytokines that are potently produced and secreted from mast cells, we measured their release by ELISA (Fig. 3, A-C). As expected, the engagement of the FcϵRI carrying the wild type β chain ITAM induced a significant net release of IL-6, IL-13, and TNFα when compared with pMX-puro-transduced cells (where cytokines measured from 5 to 10% of response of wild type β chain-reconstituted cells, see Fig. 3 legend). The YYF-, FYY-, and FYF-expressing cells either showed no significant change or a significant decrease in respons"
https://openalex.org/W2024110365,"By using a bioinformatics screen of the Escherichia coli genome for potential molybdenum-containing enzymes, we have identified a novel oxidoreductase conserved in the majority of Gram-negative bacteria. The identified operon encodes for a proposed heterodimer, YedYZ in Escherichia coli, consisting of a soluble catalytic subunit termed YedY, which is likely anchored to the membrane by a heme-containing trans-membrane subunit termed YedZ. YedY is uniquely characterized by the presence of one molybdenum molybdopterin not conjugated by an additional nucleotide, and it represents the only molybdoenzyme isolated from E. coli characterized by the presence of this cofactor form. We have further characterized the catalytic subunit YedY in both the molybdenum- and tungsten-substituted forms by using crystallographic analysis. YedY is very distinct in overall architecture from all known bacterial reductases but does show some similarity with the catalytic domain of the eukaryotic chicken liver sulfite oxidase. However, the strictly conserved residues involved in the metal coordination sphere and in the substrate binding pocket of YedY are strikingly different from that of chicken liver sulfite oxidase, suggesting a catalytic activity more in keeping with a reductase than that of a sulfite oxidase. Preliminary kinetic analysis of YedY with a variety of substrates supports our proposal that YedY and its many orthologues may represent a new type of membrane-associated bacterial reductase.

Molybdenum-coordinating enzymes fall within the broad class of enzymes associated with redox metabolic functions in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The structurally characterized enzymes can be roughly grouped into three separate families (the bacterial/eukaryotic xanthine oxidase family, the eukaryotic sulfite oxidase family, and the bacterial Me2SO reductase family), each distinctive with respect to active site structure and the type of reaction they catalyze (1Hille R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 360-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The family of xanthine oxidases contains 1 eq of a pterin cofactor coordinated to the molybdenum metal with the typical pentavalent, approximately octahedral coordination sphere in the oxidized state completed not by any side chains from the enzyme but rather by a double-bonded sulfur atom, a double-bonded oxygen atom, and an oxygen atom with a single bond (2Enroth C.

Sulfite oxidases have 1 eq of a pterin cofactor with the molybdenum coordinated by a cysteine ligand from the enzyme and two oxo groups (3Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M.

The Me2SO reductase family is diverse in both structure and function, but all members have 2 eq of the pterin cofactor, and the molybdenum coordination sphere is usually completed by a single oxo group and a sixth ligand that can be a serine as in Me2SO reductase (6Schindelin H.

Molybdoenzymes are generally conserved across the family to which they belong, and the sequence identity becomes even more significant when only the residues involved in the active site are considered. In this paper, we present the crystal structure of YedY from Escherichia coli at 2.5-Å resolution. The gene encoding for YedY was identified in the E. coli genome (11Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. II I Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar) sequence as a novel molybdoenzyme, and it was predicted to have a molybdopterin-type cofactor based on sequence similarity with known molybdopterin-containing structures. Our structural and biochemical analysis indicates that YedY constitutes the catalytic subunit of a novel membrane-associated complex found in the majority of Gram-negative bacteria. YedY is the only molybdoenzyme isolated from E. coli with the molybdopterin-type cofactor, and it represents the first structural characterization of this form of cofactor in prokaryotes and of a member of the bacterial sulfite oxidase family. Even though the overall fold of YedY is surprisingly similar to domain II of the eukaryotic chicken sulfite oxidase (CSO) 1The abbreviations used are: CSO, chicken liver sulfite oxidase; PSO, Arabidopsis thaliana sulfite oxidase; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide; Moco, molybdenum cofactor. and Arabidopsisthaliana sulfite oxidase (PSO), our structural data indicate that the active site of YedY shows striking differences, which suggest a catalytic activity more in keeping with a reductase rather than a sulfite oxidase enzyme. Those findings are supported by preliminary kinetic data with a variety of substrates. Expression and Purification of YedY—The complete E. coli genome sequence (11Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. II I Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar) was examined for potential novel molybdoenzymes, based on sequence similarity with known molybdopterin-containing proteins. One unknown gene identified in this search was yedY (b1971). The plasmid pMSYZ3 contains His6-tagged YedY (YedYHis6) and native YedZ cloned as described, 2S. J. Brokx, R. A. Rothery, G. Zhang, and J. H. Weiner, manuscript in preparation. behind the ptac promoter. The protein was expressed in E. coli strain JM109 transformed with the pMSYZ3 plasmid. The cells were grown in Terrific Broth (12Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A2.4Google Scholar) with the addition of 0.003% (w/v) metal ion mixture (13Bilous P.T. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1151-1155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except the (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O was replaced with 1 mm NaMoO4. The growth was achieved aerobically at 30 °C in 1.5 liters of media in a 4-liter flask, and expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at A600 ∼0.8. The cells were incubated for a further 12 h before harvesting. In order to incorporate tungsten in the cofactor, cells were grown in media in which the 1 mm NaMoO4 was substituted with 10 mm Na2WO4·2H2O. The cell pellets were washed in 100 mm MOPS, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, resuspended in MOPS buffer containing 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and broken open by sonication. In order to assess the presence of YedYHis6 in the periplasm, the periplasmic fraction was isolated by osmotic shock, following the procedure described elsewhere (14Benz R. Boehler-Kohler B.A. Dieterle R. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 1080-1090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Neu H.C. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3685-3692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases the supernatant was separated from the cell debris by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g at 4 °C with a Beckman L8-M Ultracentrifuge (rotor type 60Ti) and contained soluble YedYHis6. The supernatant was then applied to a Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and eluted with a gradient of 0–50 mm histidine. The fractions containing YedYHis6 were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a 10/10 MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences). YedYHis6 containing the molybdenum cofactor did not bind to the column; after concentration it was applied to a 10/30 Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with crystallization buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl). One peak containing YedYHis6 was obtained that corresponds to monomeric YedYHis6. YedYHis6 with incorporated tungsten was purified following the same procedure. Selenomethionine-substituted YedYHis6 was expressed in the same E. coli strain as the native protein. Cells were grown as described previously (16Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 870-876PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein was purified by following the same protocol as for wild-type YedYHis6. The protein samples were concentrated to a final concentration of 15 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C in 50-μl aliquots after flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. As expected due to the presence of a twin arginine translocation sequence leader, wild-type YedYHis6, tungsten YedYHis6, and selenomethionyl YedYHis6 were expressed in the periplasmic domain of E. coli. Whether they were purified from total soluble protein or specifically from the periplasmic fraction, we obtained the proteins in a homogenous and fully processed form (298 amino acids, molecular mass of 33,580 Da), as confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing (DLLSWF). The yield for wild-type YedYHis6 was ∼0.1 mg of protein per g of cells. The complete substitution of Met residues in the selenomethionyl derivative was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Static light scattering experiments indicated that the protein is monodisperse and is present as monomer in solution. The incorporation of molybdenum and tungsten cofactors was confirmed by UV-visible spectrophotometry (data not shown). Mass Spectrometry—Homogeneity of fully processed YedY was checked through electrospray mass spectrometry, as well as for incorporation of selenomethionine. Mass spectra were recorded on a PESciex API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an ion spray source. Static Light Scattering—Static light scattering experiments were done at 25 °C on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) using 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl. Refractive index and Mini-dawn light scattering detectors (Wyatt Technology) were calibrated using bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Kinetic Analysis—YedY sulfite oxidase activity was monitored as described previously, by using either Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome c (17Cohen H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 359-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or ferricyanide (18Wilson H.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15105-15113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as electron acceptor, and varying the concentration of sulfite between 2.5 and 400 μm. Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed aerobically at 25 °C using a 1.0-cm light path cuvette and a final sample volume of 1.0 ml, and the increasing absorbance at 550 nm was followed. YedY reductase activity was monitored as previously described (19Simala-Grant J.L. Weiner J.H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Substrate-dependent oxidation of the electron donor, reduced benzyl viologen (BVH+.), was monitored at 570 nm. For open cuvette (nonstoppered) assays, using degassed MOPS buffer, benzyl viologen was used at a final concentration of 0.22 mm (ϵ of BVH+· = 7.8 × 103 liters mol-1 cm-1) and sodium dithionite at a concentration of 0.63 mm. The final assay volume was kept constant, with the ordered addition of benzyl viologen, substrate, and enzyme. Each data point was the average of duplicate values, and kinetic data of kcat and Km were determined by Hanes plot. Crystallization—Native YedYHis6 crystals were grown at 18 °C by vapor diffusion methods by using 0.5 μl of protein solution and 0.5 μl of well solution per drop. Crystals of the orthorhombic space group I212121 with dimensions a = 110.73 Å, b = 164.45 Å, and c = 180.95 Å were obtained in 1.4 m Li2SO4, 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 7.3, using 15 mg/ml protein solution. Crystals typically reached their final size of ∼0.2 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm3 within typically 4 days and diffracted x-rays to 2.5 Å by using synchrotron radiation. Selenomethionyl derivative crystals were obtained under the same conditions as native YedY, using 15 mg/ml protein solution, and grew in the same crystal form. Native YedYHis6 and selenomethionine YedYHis6 crystals were predicted to have five molecules per asymmetric unit, based on unit cell dimensions and self-rotation function; the Matthews coefficient is VM = 2.5 Å3 Da-1, which corresponds to a solvent content of 49.4%. Tungsten-substituted YedYHis6 crystallized in the monoclinic P21 space group, with a = 84.84 Å, b = 177.55 Å, c = 104. 22 Å, and β = 109.74°. They were grown using a 15 mg/ml protein solution and well solution consisting of 0.1 m magnesium formate, 15% polyethylene glycol 3350, in a 1:1 ratio. Tungsten-substituted YedYHis6 crystals were predicted to have 10 molecules per asymmetric unit based on unit cell dimensions and self-rotation function; the Matthews coefficient is VM = 2.2 Å3 Da-1, which corresponds to a solvent content of 43.6%. Data Collection and Structure Determination—All data collection was carried out at 100 K. Crystals were transferred into solutions of the cryo-protectant (containing concentrations of 1 m urea, 1.25 m LiCl, and 5% glycerol for native YedY and the selenomethionine derivative, and 1 m urea, 0.1 m magnesium formate, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 for tungsten YedY). Data sets SEMET and NAT (Table I) were collected at beamline 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, CA, on an ADSC Q210 detector at a wavelength of 0.979651 Å. Both data sets were processed with DENZO (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALEPACK. Data set WNAT (Table I) was collected at beamline 8.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source, on an ADSC Q315 detector, at a wavelength of 1.54 Å. Collection at the beamline maximum intensity was impossible because of immediate crystal decay. The data set was processed with MOSFLM and scaled with SCALA (21Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D.

Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and refined by SHARP (23de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Twenty three out of 25 sites in the asymmetric unit were identified and were subsequently used as input for SOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) to obtain the remaining two sites and to calculate phases to a resolution of 4 Å (resulting figure of merit 0.41 for all data from 40.0 to 4.0 Å). The initial map was improved using density modification and NCS averaging with RESOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar), which was also used to extend the phases to 2.5 Å resolution against the data set NAT, and to determine the NCS relationships between the five monomers (final figure of merit 0.48 for all data from 40.0 to 2.5 Å). An initial model was built using XtalView (26McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar), consisting of 250 residues of one monomer, which was used as a search model in MolRep (21Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) for the remaining four monomers. The model was refined against data set NAT at 2.5 Å resolution and incorporating NCS averaging in CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The weight of the NCS restraints used was 300 at the beginning and relaxed to 50 in the final round of refinement. Iterative rounds of model building and refinement with CNS were performed. The initial model for tungsten-substituted YedY was obtained by molecular replacement with MolRep (21Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using the pentamer of native YedY as search model, and it was refined against data set WNAT at 2.2 Å resolution in CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). No NCS restraints were incorporated during the rounds of refinement. Statistics for data collection, phasing, and refinement are summarized in Table I. The molybdenum cofactor, putative urea molecule, and the coordinating oxo and water groups were all refined at full occupancy (1.0). Test refinement trials to substantiate the two additional non-protein coordinating atoms of the molybdenum were done by using combinations of both oxo and water molecules (two waters, one oxo/one water, two oxos). Based on temperature factor, distance, and lack of positive or negative residual density, we found that, at this resolution, one coordinating atom (OM2) could be unambiguously identified as an oxo group (distance of ∼1.7 Å, thermal parameters of ∼35 Å2, and no residual density after refinement), but the second coordinating atom, which also interacts with the bound urea, could be refined equally well as a water molecule coordinating the ligand and also hydrogen bonding to the urea or as an oxo coordinating the molybdenum with a close hydrogen bond to an adjacent water molecule which in turn hydrogen-bonds to the urea. Higher resolution data or a substrate-bound complex will be required to distinguish these two possibilities for this coordinating atom. The final refined model shows good stereochemistry with 85.3 and 14.2% of residues in the most favorable region and in the additional allowed region of the Ramachandran plot (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), respectively, for NAT, and 85.0% and 14.6% for WNAT. Residues 19–257 and 264–285 of each monomer could be built in the structure. Identification of a Putative Novel Oxidoreductase, YedYZ— The determination of the E. coli genome sequence (11Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. II I Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar), containing a large number of genes of unknown function, has touched off renewed searches for genes encoding possible novel and important functions. In this study, we examined the E. coli genome for potential novel molybdoenzymes. One unknown gene identified in this search was yedY (b1971). In addition the presence of a twin arginine signal peptide was of interest. YedY is a soluble periplasmic protein with a twin arginine signal peptide for processing by the twin arginine translocation (Tat)/membrane targeting translocation (MTT) system (29Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 30Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Turner R.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), with a processed molecular mass of 33,580 Da. It is proposed to be the catalytic subunit of the heterodimer, based on our sequence analysis suggesting the presence of ligands for one redox center, namely molybdopterin. Sequence analysis and topology mapping of YedZ predicts six transmembrane segments (31Drew D. Sjostrand D. Nilsson J. Urbig T. Chin C.N. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2690-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role in anchoring YedY to the bacterial membrane. Sequence analysis and the optical spectrum of the reduced versus oxidized membranes (enriched with YedZ) (32Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) are characteristic of a b-type heme, with an α component at 559 nm (data not shown), indicating that YedZ is likely similar to cytochrome b559 and in the overall electron transfer pathway with YedY. Further analysis of the biochemical interaction between YedY and YedZ will be required to confirm that YedZ is the redox partner for YedY. Most intriguingly, YedYZ orthologues are found in a wide variety of bacteria, primarily Gram-negative, including important clinical pathogens of humans, animals, and plants (Fig. 1), namely Erwinia carotovora, Brucella melitensis, and Campylobacter jejuni. The members of this broad family of proteins are highly similar in primary sequence (typically >50% identity with YedY) and are entirely uncharacterized in terms of structure and function. YedY and its orthologues align poorly with other well characterized molybdoenzymes, including the sulfite oxidases, Me2SO reductases, and xanthine oxidases, with no conservation of the key catalytic groups found in these systems. Overall Architecture—We have determined the structure of YedY using MAD phasing from incorporated selenomethionine. YedY is a spherical molecule of mixed α + β structure with overall dimensions 50 × 45 × 40 Å and an accessible surface area of ∼11,800 Å2 (Fig. 2A). The overall fold of YedY consists of 10 β-strands, organized into two β-sheets, and 12 α-helices. Both β-sheets are mixed, and they are located on opposite sides of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco). The C-terminal β-sheet centers on the two longest β-strands (β3 and β4) of the domain, which form a long and twisted β-hairpin. The α-helices are predominantly short and exposed to bulk solvent. α5 and α6 are located before and after the long β-hairpin of the domain, respectively, and they form a hydrophobic surface region located on the opposite side of the Moco (Fig. 3B). YedY shares no structural features with the bacterial molybdenum cofactor containing enzymes of the families Me2SO reductase (7Dias J.M. Than M.E. Humm A. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D.

https://openalex.org/W2131462893,"Extracellular zinc promotes cell proliferation and its deficiency leads to impairment of this process, which is particularly important in epithelial cells. We have recently characterized a zinc-sensing receptor (ZnR) linking extracellular zinc to intracellular release of calcium. In the present study, we addressed the role of extracellular zinc, acting via the ZnR, in regulating the MAP kinase pathway and Na+/H+ exchange in colonocytes. We demonstrate that Ca2+ release, mediated by the ZnR, induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which is highly metal-specific, mediated by physiological concentrations of extracellular Zn2+ but not by Cd2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, or Mn2+. Desensitization of the ZnR by Zn2+, is followed by ∼90% inhibition of the Zn2+-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that the ZnR is a principal link between extracellular Zn2+ and ERK1/2 activation. Application of both the IP3 pathway and PI 3-kinase antagonists largely inhibited Zn2+-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The physiological significance of the Zn2+-dependent activation of ERK1/2 was addressed by monitoring Na+/H+ exchanger activity in HT29 cells and in native colon epithelium. Preincubation of the cells with zinc was followed by robust activation of Na+/H+ exchange, which was eliminated by cariporide (0.5 μm); indicating that zinc enhances the activity of NHE1. Activation of NHE1 by zinc was totally blocked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126. Prolonged acidification, in contrast, stimulates NHE1 by a distinct pathway that is not affected by extracellular Zn2+ or inhibitors of the MAP kinase pathway. Desensitization of ZnR activity eliminates the Zn2+-dependent, but not the prolonged acidification-dependent activation of NHE1, indicating that Zn2+-dependent activation of H+ extrusion is specifically mediated by the ZnR. Our results support a role for extracellular zinc, acting through the ZnR, in regulating multiple signaling pathways that affect pH homeostasis in colonocytes. Furthermore activation of both, ERK and NHE1, by extracellular zinc may provide the mechanism linking zinc to enhanced cell proliferation. Extracellular zinc promotes cell proliferation and its deficiency leads to impairment of this process, which is particularly important in epithelial cells.

Preincubation of the cells with zinc was followed by robust activation of Na+/H+ exchange, which was eliminated by cariporide (0.5 μm); indicating that zinc enhances the activity of NHE1. Activation of NHE1 by zinc was totally blocked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126. Prolonged acidification, in contrast, stimulates NHE1 by a distinct pathway that is not affected by extracellular Zn2+ or inhibitors of the MAP kinase pathway. Desensitization of ZnR activity eliminates the Zn2+-dependent, but not the prolonged acidification-dependent activation of NHE1, indicating that Zn2+-dependent activation of H+ extrusion is specifically mediated by the ZnR. Our results support a role for extracellular zinc, acting through the ZnR, in regulating multiple signaling pathways that affect pH homeostasis in colonocytes. Furthermore activation of both, ERK and NHE1, by extracellular zinc may provide the mechanism linking zinc to enhanced cell proliferation. Arrested cell proliferation is a hallmark of zinc deficiency. This is particularly true in gastrointestinal cells (1MacDonald R.S. J.

Extracellular zinc has been shown to regulate cell proliferation via the MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ZnR, zinc-sensing receptor; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PLC, phospholipase C; PKC, protein kinase C; IP, inositol phosphate; CaM, calcium-calmodulin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. kinase pathway in several cell types (5Park K.S.

Although the mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects of zinc are well recognized (8Maret W. BioMetals. 2001; 14: 187-190Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Beyersmann D. Haase H. BioMetals. 2001; 14: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), and the treatment of severe diarrhea by addition of dietary zinc is common, the direct link between this ion and the cellular mechanisms regulating proliferation is not well understood. It has been suggested that a decrease in intracellular zinc may lead directly to a reduction in activity of various metalloenzymes involved in transcription and cell metabolism (1MacDonald R.S. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1500S-1508SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wu F.Y. Wu C.W. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 251-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Several studies, however, indicate that extracellular zinc acts as a signaling molecule. In tracheal cells, for example, extracellular zinc, through activation of Src, leads to transactivation of EGFR and subsequently to activation of ERK1/2 (11Wu W. Graves L.M. Gill G.N. Parsons S.J. Samet J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24252-24257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, extracellular zinc has been shown to trigger the activation of the PI3K pathway, subsequently leading to the activation of AKT and the S6 kinase (12Kim S. Jung Y. Kim D. Koh H. Chung J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25979-25984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways linking extracellular zinc to these proteins and to subsequent regulation of cellular ion, pH or volume homeostasis, however, remain poorly understood. We have recently identified and characterized an extracellular zinc-sensing receptor (ZnR) that triggers, upon exposure to extracellular zinc, the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by activation of the IP3 pathway (13Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The pharmacological profile of the calcium response triggered by the ZnR, particularly its sensitivity to the PLC inhibitor, U73122, and the inhibitory effect of the IP3 receptor blocker, 2-APB, indicates that the ZnR is a Gq-coupled receptor (GPCR). Both the Gα and the Gβγ dimer of various GPCRs have been linked to activation of the MAP kinase via multiple intracellular pathways (14Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 15Naor Z. Benard O. Seger R. Trends Endocrinol.

Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). In intestinal cells, furthermore, the muscarinic receptor has been shown to play a key role in promoting ion transport through activation of MAP and PI 3-kinase signal transduction (17Keely S.J. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33449-33454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Keely S.J. Calandrella S.O. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12619-12625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A role for the ZnR in activation of the MAP kinase pathway is demonstrated in this work. The ZnR was initially characterized in the colonocytic cell line, HT29, where a robust calcium signal was generated following activation of the receptor by changes in the concentration of extracellular Zn2+ (13Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Importantly, the Ca2+ response induced by the ZnR in HT29 cells is triggered by ∼80 μm zinc, i.e. within the physiological range of zinc concentrations found in the digestive tract (19Sandstrom B. Cederblad A. Kivisto B. Stenquist B. Andersson H. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1986; 44: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Sandstrom B. Analyst. 1995; 120: 913-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, activation of the ZnR also resulted in activation of Na+/H+ exchange in colonocytes. Distinct NHE isoforms are expressed in the colonic mucosa, each playing a unique physiological role in colon physiology (21Dudeja P.K. Rao D.D. Syed I. Joshi V. Dahdal R.Y. Gardner C. Risk M.C.

It was not known, however, which of the NHE isoforms is regulated by the ZnR. The first NHE isoform, NHE1, is mostly expressed on the basolateral membrane of colonocytes and is involved in regulating the pHi, volume homeostasis (22Bachmann O. Riederer B. Rossmann H. Groos S. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Gregor M. Manns M.P. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2004; 287: G125-G133Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Hasselblatt P. Warth R.

Such activity is of prime importance considering the major changes in osmolarity and the acid load imposed by the permeation of short chain fatty acids generated by bacterial fermentation (24Chu J. Chu S. Montrose M.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C358-C372Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Chu S. Montrose M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3303-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Activation of NHE1, moreover, enhances cell survival by inhibiting caspase activity and by enhancing the PI3K pathway (27Wu K.L. Khan S. Lakhe-Reddy S. Jarad G. Mukherjee A. Obejero-Paz C.A. Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. Schelling J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26280-26286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The other NHE isoforms expressed in the colon are NHE3 which is involved in vectorial solute transport, but is not expressed in HT29 cells (25Gonda T. Maouyo D. Rees S.E. Montrose M.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G259-G270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NHE2 which has been suggested to mediate butyrate-stimulated sodium absorption (22Bachmann O. Riederer B. Rossmann H. Groos S.

Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C1246-C1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the current study, we sought to identify the principal pathways activated by extracellular Zn2+ in colonocytes and to determine what role, if any, ERK1/2 plays in mediating the above described zinc-dependent regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Our results indicate that extracellular Zn2+, acting through the ZnR, triggers activation of ERK and PI 3-kinase pathways. Subsequently, the zinc-dependent activation of ERK1/2 leads to a robust and specific activation of NHE1 in HT29 colonocytes and similarly in murine native colon epithelium. Thus, our results provide a cellular mechanism linking the well known effects of zinc to cellular proliferation. Cell Culture—HT29-Cl cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described (29Sekler I. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21028-21034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Maouyo D. Chu S. Montrose M.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C973-C981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown on 60-mm plates were serum-starved for 24 h, and then washed in Ringer's solution for 30 min. The cells were subsequently stimulated in Ringer's solution supplemented with ZnSO4 (80 μm, unless otherwise indicated), for 10 min. The zinc chelator, Ca-EDTA (100 μm), was added to the Ringer's solution to reduce residual zinc in control cultures. Agonists and inhibitors used for the analysis of the various signal transduction pathways were added prior to the addition of zinc, during the wash in Ringer's solution, for the indicated times. Cells were then harvested into lysis buffer as previously described (31Hazan-Halevy I. Seger R. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12416-12423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged for 30 min (14,000 rpm). Supernatants (cytosolic fraction) were collected, SDS sample buffer was added, the samples were boiled for 5 min and then frozen at –80 °C until used. Tissue Preparation—Wistar rats (70–150 g, n = 4) were killed, and the colon removed and washed using Parsons solution as previously described (32Schultheiss G. Lan Kocks S. Diener M. Biol. Proc. Online. 2002; 3: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, a longitudinal incision was made along the colon wall and about 5 tissue samples were cut from the distal part of the colon. The tissue was spread, keeping the mucosal-luminal side upwards, on coverslips using cyanoacrylate glue (24Chu J. Chu S. Montrose M.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C358-C372Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The tissue samples were kept at 37 °C in high K+ solution for no longer than 3 h (32Schultheiss G. Lan Kocks S. Diener M. Biol. Proc. Online. 2002; 3: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In each experimental group, the results are the mean of at least 15 cells from three independent experiments from each animal. Monitoring Kinase Activation—Cell samples containing the cytosolic fraction (20 μg) were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (29Sekler I. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21028-21034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Maouyo D. Chu S. Montrose M.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C973-C981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against doubly phosphorylated ERK1/2 (33Wolf I. Rubinfeld H. Yoon S. Marmor G. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24490-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and total ERK1/2 or phosphorylated AKT and total AKT (Sigma and Cell Signaling) were detected digitally using ChemImager 5 (Alpha-Innotech, Labtrade), and the blots quantified using the ChemImager software. Phospho-ERK1/2 or AKT levels were normalized against the total ERK1/2 or AKT protein, respectively. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is presented as a percentage of the effect triggered by application of 80 μm zinc. Each graph represents an average of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test assuming equal variance, comparing each treatment to zinc: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. Fluorescent Imaging—Fluorescent imaging measurements were acquired as previously described (13Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, for [Ca2+]i and [Zn2+]i measurements, cells were incubated with 5 μm Fura-2 AM (TEF) for 30 min in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in Ringer's solution. For pH measurements, cells were loaded with 1.25 μm BCECF-AM for 12 min. Following dye loading, the coverslips were mounted in a flow chamber. For pHi calibration, nigericin was added to KCl Ringer's (120 mm KCl replacing NaCl) solution at pH 6.8, 7, and 7.2, the relative fluorescence was monitored, and a linear calibration curve produced (34Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Sterzel R.B. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C857-C869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Sterzel R.B. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C844-C856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NH4Cl prepulse paradigm was applied to estimate Na+/H+ exchanger activity. Briefly, cells were washed with Ringer's containing NH4Cl (30 mm), and an intracellular equilibrium of NH+4 and NH3 was reached. Replacing the extracellular buffer with Na+-free Ringer's (iso-osmotically replaced by NMG) caused rapid acidification of the cells. Na+/H+ exchanger activity was estimated by calculating the rate of recovery (dpHi/dt) following addition of Na+ to the Ringer's solution. The results shown are the means of 4–6 independent experiments, with averaged responses of 30 cells in each experiment. Statistical analysis was performed as described above, comparing the activity of NHE in treated cells versus control cells. For imaging experiments of the native colonic tissue, the coverslips were incubated with BCECF (5 μm) in the presence of 0.05% pluronic acid for 30 min and then washed with 0.1% bovine serum albumin serum in Ringer's solution for 10 min before mounting on the stage of an Olympus BX-50 microscope. The pHi measurements were performed only using crypts such that the in epithelial cells clearly surrounded the lumen. The NH4Cl prepulse paradigm and analysis was performed as described above. Specificity and Temporal Dependence of ERK1/2 Phosphorylation by Zinc—To determine if zinc, at physiological concentrations shown previously to activate the ZnR, will activate the MAP kinase pathway, analysis of time dependence was performed. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was monitored by Western blots using antibodies recognizing the doubly phosphorylated, active form of ERK1/2 in serum-starved HT29 cells. To determine the time course of ERK phosphorylation, zinc (80 μm) was applied for the indicated times and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 monitored (Fig. 1A). Zinc-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was apparent already 2 min following application, peaking at 30 min. Phosphorylation was reduced after 60 min by about 30%, and approached resting levels after 2 h. Only very slight staining of the two bands was detected when extracellular residual zinc was chelated by Ca-EDTA. No significant change was detected in the total-ERK1/2 following addition of zinc. Application of the MEK1/2 inhibitors (U0126, PD98095) for 10 min in Ringer's solution, inhibited Zn2+-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B), indicating that the effect is mediated through activation of MEK1/2. The MAP kinase pathway can be activated by a number of different heavy metals (6Samet J.M. Graves L.M. Quay J. Dailey L.A. Devlin R.B. Ghio A.J. Wu W. Bromberg P.A. Reed W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L551-L558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We sought, therefore, to determine if ERK1/2 activation in colonocytes is metal-specific. Cells were exposed to the indicated heavy metals (100 μm, 10 min), and the resulting phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was compared with the effect triggered by zinc (Fig. 1C). As shown, application of Mn2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, or Fe2+ failed to trigger activation of ERK1/2. In contrast, Zn2+ was highly potent in triggering ERK phosphorylation, indicating that in colonocytes, zinc plays a prominent and highly specific role in the activation of this important intracellular signaling pathway. ERK1/2 Is Activated by Extracellular Zinc via the ZnR— While the above results suggest that zinc specifically triggers ERK1/2 phosphorylation, they do not specify the role of extracellular zinc. To address this, we examined whether cellular Zn2+ influx is apparent at concentrations and time intervals required for ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HT29 cells loaded with Fura-2 AM. This dye, known primarily as a Ca2+-sensitive indicator, has a 100-fold higher affinity to Zn2+ (Kd[Zn2+] ∼2 nm) (36Atar D. Backx P.H. Appel M.M. Gao W.D. Marban E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2473-2477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), that is, at least 10-fold higher than the zinc probe previously used to monitor zinc in HT29 cells, Mag-fura (5Park K.S. Lee N.G. Lee K.H. Seo J.T. Choi K.Y. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2003; 19: 19Google Scholar, 37Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M. Yu S.P. Ying H.S. Koh J.Y. Kerchner G.A. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9554-9564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Fura-2 AM is a highly sensitive dye for monitoring even minute changes in intracellular zinc concentrations. Potential interference by intracellular Ca2+ was eliminated prior to application of zinc by depleting the intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin (200 nm, not shown) and by the use of nominally Ca2+-free solutions. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was no apparent rise in Fura-2 fluorescence when HT29 cells were perfused with zinc-containing Ringer's solution for 10 min following Ca2+ store depletion. The sensitivity of this approach is demonstrated by monitoring Zn2+ influx, induced by opening of L-type calcium channels by depolarization, of Min6 insulinoma cells. Application of the intracellular zinc chelator, TPEN (50 μm), reduced the fluorescent signal to resting levels (not shown), indicating that it is indeed triggered by zinc. At time intervals sufficient to trigger a robust activation of ERK, therefore, no zinc influx was apparent in HT29 cells, supporting our hypothesis that ERK1/2 phosphorylation is mediated by extracellular Zn2+. To study the physiological significance of ERK1/2 activation by zinc, a dose response analysis was performed. Previous studies have employed zinc in the presence of serum (5Park K.S. Lee N.G. Lee K.H. Seo J.T. Choi K.Y. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2003; 19: 19Google Scholar, 38Thamilselvan V. Fomby M. Walsh M. Basson M.D. J. Surg. Res. 2003; 110: 255-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A major drawback of this approach is that the fraction of the zinc ions bound to serum components is difficult to estimate, the result being that the free zinc concentration under such conditions is unknown. We therefore used zinc in Ringer's solution, such that the free zinc concentrations obtained (calculated using Geochem software, Ref. 13Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) are similar to those present in the digestive tract (19Sandstrom B. Cederblad A. Kivisto B. Stenquist B. Andersson H. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1986; 44: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Sandstrom B. Analyst. 1995; 120: 913-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was monitored in cells exposed to the indicated concentrations of free zinc for 10 min (Fig. 2B) and was already apparent using 40 μm zinc. The effect of zinc on ERK phosphorylation was maximal at 80 μm and at 150 μm was still 10 ± 0.2-fold higher than controls. This was reduced by ∼30% at higher zinc concentrations (200 μm). The results of this analysis show that zinc at concentrations found in the digestive tract (19Sandstrom B. Cederblad A. Kivisto B. Stenquist B. Andersson H. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1986; 44: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Sandstrom B. Analyst. 1995; 120: 913-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Knudsen E. Jensen M. Solgaard P. Sorensen S.S. Sandstrom B. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1274-1282PubMed Google Scholar), which induce Ca2+ release through the ZnR (13Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), also trigger phosphorylation of ERK1/2. We next sought to determine the specific role played by the ZnR in mediating zinc-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. To do this, we exploited the fact that the ZnR undergoes a profound functional desensitization that remains refractory for 3 h following exposure to 100 μm Zn2+ for 30 min. The ZnR-dependent Ca2+ release following reapplication of Zn2+ recovered to ∼10 and 20% after 4 and 6 h, respectively (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, zinc desensitization of the ZnR was also followed by a similar pattern of inhibition of the zinc-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2. The inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, monitored 3 h after the desensitization, was almost complete (90 ± 5%) and was still apparent even after 6 h, yielding an ∼50% inhibition. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by PMA (Fig. 3C) was used as a positive control to determine if the MAPK pathway, following zinc desensitization, remained responsive. No significant changes were detected in ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by PMA in cells that were desensitized versus control cells, indicating that the ERK1/2 pathway was functional. The striking effect of ZnR desensitization, and the similarity between the patterns of the Ca2+ response and the zinc-dependent ERK1/2 activation suggest that a functional ZnR is essential for mediating zinc-dependent activation of the MAP kinase pathway. ERK1/2 Activation by Extracellular Zn2+Is Mediated by Ca2+-dependent and -independent Pathways—Activation of ERK has previously been demonstrated to be mediated by intracellular Ca2+ released via the IP3 pathway, such as that triggered by zinc via the ZnR in epithelial cells, ATP in astrocytes or by the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, in intestinal cells (18Keely S.J. Calandrella S.O. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12619-12625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 40Neary J.T. Kang Y. Willoughby K.A. Ellis E.F. J.

Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). However, cell signaling upstream or distinct from the IP3 pathway may also play a role in Zn2+-mediated ERK activation. We have, therefore, addressed the role of the Ca2+ rise in ERK activation by chelating intracellular Ca2+ using BAPTA-AM (25 μm, applied for 15 min prior to addition of zinc). As shown in Fig. 4A, BAPTA partially reduced zinc-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, resulting in 60 ± 3% inhibition of Zn2+-dependent activation. To further elucidate the role of upstream components of the IP3 pathway, cells were pretreated with the PLC inhibitor, U73122 (4 μm, applied for 15 min). Application of the PLC inhibitor resulted in 40 ± 4% inhibition of ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4A), similar to the effect of Ca2+ chelation. These results indicate that a calcium rise, triggered by IP3 pathway activation, plays a role in mediating zinc-dependent ERK activation in HT29 cells. Calcium-calmodulin (CaM) kinase II is activated by intracellular calcium rise and has been suggested to trigger MAP kinase activation, possibly by inhibiting Ras-GTPase-activating protein (RAS-GAP), thereby leading to Ras activation (43Egea J.

We studied the role of CaM kinase II in Zn2+-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 using the CaM kinase II inhibitors, KN93 and KN62 (applied for 30 min in Ringer's solution). As shown in Fig. 4A, the inhibitory effect of CaM kinase II inhibitors (40 ± 2%) was similar to that of the upstream inhibitors, U73122 and BAPTA, suggesting that calcium-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation by the ZnR is mediated by CaM kinase II. A calcium rise like that mediated by the ZnR may trigger PKC activation. However, the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (BI) did not attenuate the zinc-dependent activation of ERK (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Zn2+-dependent activation of ERK1/2 is not mediate"
https://openalex.org/W2089870888,"The catalytic nucleotide binding subunit (subunit A) of the vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (or V-ATPase) is homologous to the β-subunit of the F-ATPase but contains a 90-amino acid insert not present in the β-subunit, termed the nonhomologous region. We previously demonstrated that mutations in this region lead to changes in coupling of proton transport and ATPase activity and to inhibition of in vivo dissociation of the V-ATPase complex, an important regulatory mechanism (Shao, E., Nishi T., Kawasaki-Nishi, S., and Forgac, M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 12985–12991). Measurement of the ATP dependence of coupling for the wild type and mutant proteins demonstrates that the coupling differences are observed at ATP concentrations up to 1 mm. A decrease in coupling efficiency is observed at higher ATP concentrations for the wild type and mutant V-ATPases. Immunoprecipitation of an epitope-tagged nonhomologous region from cell lysates indicates that this region is able to bind to the integral V0 domain in the absence of the remainder of the A subunit, an interaction confirmed by immunoprecipitation of V0. Interaction between the nonhomologous region and V0 is reduced upon incubation of cells in the absence of glucose, suggesting that the nonhomologous region may act as a trigger to activate in vivo dissociation. Immunoprecipitation suggests that the epitope tag on the nonhomologous region becomes less accessible upon glucose withdrawal, possibly due to binding to another cellular target. In vivo dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose removal is also blocked by chloroquine, a weak base that neutralizes the acidic pH of the vacuole. The results suggest that the dependence of in vivo dissociation of the V-ATPase on catalytic activity may be due to neutralization of the yeast vacuole, which in turn blocks glucose-dependent dissociation.

Sequence alignment of the A subunit and the β-subunit reveals a 90-amino acid region (termed the nonhomologous domain), which is present in the A subunit but which is absent from the β-subunit (24Zimniak L.

Although not conserved between the V and F-ATPases, this region is highly conserved among V-ATPase A subunit sequences (24Zimniak L. Dittrich P. Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Taiz L. J. Biol.

We have previously demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis of the VMA1 gene that encodes subunit A in yeast that changes in the nonhomologous domain can alter coupling of proton transport and ATPase activity (29Shao E. Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12985-12991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have also observed that mutations in this domain are able to block in vivo dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion (29Shao E. Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12985-12991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Reversible dissociation of the V-ATPase has been shown to represent an important mechanism of regulating V-ATPase activity in vivo (30Kane P.M. J. Biol.

In the current study, we have further characterized the changes in coupling behavior observed upon mutagenesis of the nonhomologous region and have investigated the ability of this region to interact with the integral V0 domain. The results suggest that the nonhomologous region may serve as a trigger to activate reversible dissociation of the V-ATPase.

Yeast strain SF838 –5Aalpha vma1Δ 8 (MATalpha, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, ade6, vma1Δ::LEU2) was used for transformation and subsequent biochemical characterization. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium or supplemented synthetic dextrose medium. Yeast strains expressing the VMA1 gene bearing mutations in the nonhomologous region were constructed as previously described (29Shao E. Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12985-12991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plasmid p426-NH::HA was generated to study the HA-tagged nonhomologous region of Vma1p. Plasmid Construction and Transformation—Both SpeI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites were introduced into the nucleic acid sequence of the nonhomologous region of the VMA1 gene using the polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of the nonhomologous region of the VMA1 gene (NHR) was amplified from the wild type plasmid (Yip5-VMA1) using primers containing the restriction enzyme sites SpeI and BamHI and then cloned into the 2-μm plasmid, p426, using the SpeI and BamHI sites (p426-NHR). The sequence of the cloned nonhomologous region of the VMA1 gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing using an automated sequencer from Applied Biosystems. The oligonucleotides used for amplification of the nonhomologous region of the VMA1 gene were as follows, with the restriction enzyme sites underlined: NHR forward (SpeI), 5′-GGACTAGTAAACAATGCCGGGAAAGTTTCAAGTCGGC-3′; NHR reverse (BamHI), 5′-CGCGGATCCAGGATAGTCAGCAGATAACTT-3′. The three tandem repeats of the nine-amino acid HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) were ligated into the BamHI and KpnI sites of p426-NHR (p426-NHR::HA). This resulted in insertion of three tandem repeated HA tags after amino acid residue Pro-233 of the nonhomologous region of Vma1p. Yeast strain SF838 –5Aalpha vma1Δ 8 were transformed using the lithium acetate method with p426-NHR::HA and p426 vector alone (32Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on Ura– plates as described previously (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). Growth phenotypes of the transformants were assessed on YPD plates buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4 or 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or pH 5.5. Isolation of Vacuolar Membrane Vesicles—Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated using a modified protocol described by Uchida et al. (34Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast integrated with wild type plasmid (YIp5-VMA1), the nonhomologous mutants, or the vector YIp5 alone were cultured overnight in 1 liter of YPD (pH 5.5) to log phase. Cells were pelleted, washed once with water, and resuspended in 100 ml of 10 mm dithiothreitol and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, cells were pelleted again; washed once with 100 ml of YPD medium containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.5, and 2 mg of Zymolase 100T; and incubated at 30 °C with gentle shaking for 60 min. The resulting spheroplasts were osmotically lysed, and the vacuoles were isolated by flotation on two consecutive Ficoll gradients. Protein concentrations were determined by Lowry assay (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Yeast were grown to log phase at 30 °C in Ura–-selective medium and whole cell lysates were prepared using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, as described previously (36Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The expression of the nonhomologous region of subunit A was detected by Western blotting using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 against HA, whereas subunits A and B were detected using the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 directed against subunit A and the monoclonal antibody 13D11 against subunit B, respectively, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. In Vivo Interaction between the Nonhomologous Region and the V0 Domain—Dissociation and reassembly of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion and glucose readdition were measured as described previously (37Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with some modification. The yeast cells containing the integrated wild type plasmid (Yip5-VMA1) or the vma1Δ strain expressing the HA-tagged nonhomologous region of Vma1p or the vector alone were grown to log phase in Ura–-selective medium. The cells were converted to spheroplasts by treatment with Zymolase 100T and incubated in YEP medium with or without 2% glucose for 15 min at 30 °C. An aliquot of the spheroplasts incubated in the absence of glucose was subsequently incubated in the presence of 2% glucose for an additional 15 min. Spheroplasts were pelleted and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% C12E9, protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 1 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). The V0 domain was immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody 10D7-A7 against Vph1p and protein A-Sepharose, whereas the HA-tagged nonhomologous region was immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody 3F10 against HA and protein G-agarose. Where indicated, the V1 domain and intact V1V0 were immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against subunit A and protein A-Sepharose. Samples were then separated on 4–20% gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was performed using the monoclonal antibody 3F10 against HA to detect the nonhomologous region as well as the polyclonal antibody against subunit d and the monoclonal antibody 10D7-A7 against Vph1p to detect the V0 domain, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. To detect V1 subunits, monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against subunit A or 13D11 against subunit B or rabbit polyclonal antibody against subunits C, D, E, F, G, or H was employed as primary antibody in Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis of expression levels of the nonhomologous region of Vma1p and other V-ATPase subunits in whole cell lysates was performed as previously described (37Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Protein samples were precipitated with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid, washed with cold acetone, and redissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated with antibodies against either the HA epitope tag or subunits of the yeast V-ATPase followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies as previously described (37Kawasaki-Nishi S.

Isolated vacuoles were incubated in ATPase assay buffer (50 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.35 mm NADH, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase) with 0.1% Me2SO or 1 μm concanamycin A at room temperature for 10 min. The assay was initiated by the addition of ATP at the indicated concentrations, and the absorbance at 341 nm was measured continuously using a Kontron UV-visible spectrophotometer. ATP-dependent proton transport was measured by the initial rate of ATP-dependent fluorescence quenching with the fluorescence probe 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer (39Feng Y.

Approximately 4–5 × 106 log phase yeast cells were harvested, resuspended in 500 μl of YPD buffered with 50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.6) containing 200 μm quinacrine or in 500 μl of YPD buffered with 50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.6) containing 200 μm chloroquine, and incubated with shaking at room temperature for 5 min. Cells treated with chloroquine were then sedimented and resuspended in 500 μl of YPD buffered with 50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.6) containing 200 μm quinacrine and incubated with shaking at room temperature for 5 min. Cells were sedimented at 10,000 × g for 5 s and resuspended in 50 μl of 2% glucose buffered with 50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.6). 8-μl samples were applied to a microscope slide and visualized immediately with a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope. Cells were viewed under Nomarski optics to observe cell morphology and in fluorescence mode using a fluorescein filter with a 40× objective to observe quinacrine staining. Chloroquine Treatment and in Vivo Dissociation of the V-ATPase in Response to Glucose Depletion—Dissociation and reassembly of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion and glucose readdition were measured as described previously with some modifications (37Kawasaki-Nishi S.

Yeast containing integrated wild type Vma1p were grown in YPD, pH 5.5, overnight to an absorbance at 600 nm of <1.0. The cells were converted to spheroplasts by treatment with Zymolase 100T and incubated in YEP medium with or without 2% glucose in the presence or in the absence of 200 μm chloroquine for 15 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% C12E9 (polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether), protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 1 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). The V-ATPase complexes were immunoprecipitated using antibody 13D11 against the B subunit and protein A-Sepharose followed by separation on 8% acrylamide gels and transfer to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was then performed using the antibody 8B1-F3 against the A subunit and antibody 13D11 against the B subunit to detect the V1 domain and antibody 10D7-A7 against Vph1p to detect the V0 domain followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Dissociation of the V-ATPase complex is reflected as a reduction in the a subunit immunoprecipitated using the antibody directed against subunit B of the V1 domain. ATP Dependence of the Coupling Efficiency of Proton Transport and ATP Hydrolysis for Wild Type and Mutant Forms of Vma1p Containing Mutations in the Nonhomologous Region—We had previously demonstrated that mutations in the nonhomologous region could result in changes of the coupling of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis by the V-ATPases (29Shao E. Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12985-12991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In particular, vacuolar membranes isolated from two mutants (P223V and P233V) showed reduced proton transport but nearly the same level of ATPase activity as membranes isolated from yeast expressing wild type Vma1p, suggesting that these mutations resulted in a partial uncoupling of proton transport and ATPase activity (29Shao E. Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12985-12991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By contrast, the vacuolar membranes from cells expressing the P217V mutation showed only 30–40% of wild type levels of ATPase activity but significantly higher proton transport than wild type. This result suggested a tighter coupling of proton transport and ATPase activity in this mutant and led to the conclusion that the wild type V-ATPase is not optimally coupled. The latter result is consistent with the hypothesis that vacuolar acidification may be modulated by changes in the tightness of coupling of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis by the V-ATPase (42Arai H. Pink S. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 43Nelson N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The previous studies were conducted at a single ATP concentration (0.5 mm) that is below the typical cytoplasmic ATP concentration measured in yeast cells (44Canonaco F. Schlattner U. Pruett P.S. Wallimann T. Sauer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31303-31309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, it had previously been reported for the V-ATPase from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles that the tightness of coupling of proton transport and ATPase activity by the V-ATPase varied as a function of ATP concentration, with higher concentrations of ATP leading to a progressive uncoupling of these activities (42Arai H. Pink S. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to determine whether the changes in coupling behavior observed for strains expressing mutant forms of Vma1p were preserved at higher and lower concentrations of ATP. Fig. 1a shows the ATP dependence of concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity over the range of 0.1–2.0 mm ATP for vacuolar membranes isolated from cells expressing wild type Vma1p as well as the P217V, P223V, and P233V mutants. Fig. 1b shows the ATP dependence of concanamycin-sensitive proton transport (as assessed from the initial rate of ATP-dependent quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine fluorescence). Fig. 1c shows the ATP dependence of the ratio of proton transport to ATPase activity over the same range of ATP concentrations. Consistent with previous results (42Arai H. Pink S. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), proton transport peaks and then decreases at higher ATP concentrations, whereas ATPase activity increases and then plateaus over the same concentration range.

Signaling from Cdc42 is propagated via its effector molecules that specifically bind to Cdc42 in the GTP-bound form. The cell-cell contact regulator and actin-binding protein IQGAP1 is described as effector of Cdc42 and Rac. Unexpectedly, we show in this study that IQGAP1 bound also directly nucleotide-depleted Cdc42 (Cdc42-ND). This interaction was enhanced in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and in epithelial cells without cell-cell contacts. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that IQGAP1 was Ser1443-phosphorylated in vivo, potentially by protein kinase Cϵ and upon loss of cell-cell contacts. In addition, we identified two independent domains of the IQGAP1 C terminus that bound exclusively Cdc42-ND. These domains interacted with each other, favoring the binding to Cdc42-GTP. Moreover, phosphorylation on Ser1443 strongly inhibited this intramolecular interaction. Thus, we unraveled a molecular mechanism that reveals a novel type of Rho-GTPase regulator. We propose that, depending on its phosphorylation state, IQGAP1 might serve as an effector or sequester nucleotide-free Cdc42 to prevent signaling.

Epithelial polarity is regulated by the Rho-GTPase Cdc42, which is implicated in signal transduction, gene regulation, cell cycle progression, and cytoskeletal regulation (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, Cdc42 regulates establishment and maintenance of basolateral polarity by controlling endocytic and secretory trafficking (2Kroschewski R. Hall A. Mellman I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 3Cohen D. Musch A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Musch A. Cohen D. Kreitzer G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2171-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The basolateral membrane of epithelial cells is formed upon establishment of cell-cell contacts. Trans-activation of nectins and formation of E-cadherin mediated cell-cell contacts lead to the activation of Cdc42 (5Fukuhara A. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Takai Y. J. Biol.

The most direct activators of GTPases are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; Ab, antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; Cdc42-ND, nucleotide-depleted Cdc42; PI, phosphatase inhibitor(s); PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CIP, calf intestine phosphatase; P-stain, phosphostain; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; Ab, antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; Cdc42-ND, nucleotide-depleted Cdc42; PI, phosphatase inhibitor(s); PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CIP, calf intestine phosphatase; P-stain, phosphostain; DTT, dithiothreitol. which are characterized by four properties. GEFs bind to a GDP-bound GTPase, they catalyze the displacement of GDP and stabilize the resulting nucleotide-free GTPase. Due to the high ratio of GTP to GDP in cells, the nucleotide-depleted GTPase-GEF complex dissociates into GEF and GTP-bound (active) GTPase. The active GTPase can then bind selectively to effectors and elicit downstream effects. Activation of GEFs for Cdc42 at sites of cell-cell contacts might involve several modes. Some GEFs are activated by phosphorylation, which abolishes intramolecular inhibition (7Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 8Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Buchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 268: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Other GEFs need additional factors to exhibit GEF activity. For example, interaction of intersectin with the Cdc42 effector protein N-WASP causes the activation of intersectin GDP displacement activity (10Hussain N.K. Jenna S. Glogauer M. Quinn C.C. Wasiak S.

Also, interaction of DOCK180 with the protein ELMO might be necessary for its activation as a GEF for Rac (11Brugnera E. Haney L. Grimsley C. Lu M. Walk S.F. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Macara I.G.

Mammalian IQGAPs are scaffolding proteins with conserved homologues in budding yeast, Dictyostelium, and Caenorhabditis elegans and have been shown to regulate actomyosin ring formation during cytokinesis, cell motility, and cell-cell contacts (13Briggs M.W. Sacks D.B. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of a GAP homology domain in the C terminus, no GAP activity could be demonstrated (14Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, IQGAP1 is known as a potential effector of Cdc42 and Rac. In several biochemical studies, the effect of Cdc42-GTP or Rac-GTP on IQGAP1 interaction properties was described, but the in vivo consequences are less well characterized (14Hart M.J. Callow M.G.

IQGAP1 can directly bind and cross-link actin filaments in dependence on Cdc42-GTP (15Bashour A.M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J.

Cdc42-GTP abolishes the binding of IQGAP1 to E-cadherin and β-catenin, increasing cell-cell adhesion (16Fukata M. Kuroda S. Nakagawa M. Kawajiri A. Itoh N. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S.

IQGAP1 was also shown to capture microtubule plus ends with activated GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 via the microtubule-associated protein CLIP-170 (20Fukata M. Watanabe T. Noritake J. Nakagawa M. Yamaga M.

Guo Z. Watson C. Chen E. Kong R. Wang W. Yao X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanism of IQGAP1 interaction with Cdc42. We demonstrate that IQGAP1 represents a novel type of interactor for Rho-GTPases. Besides its binding to Cdc42-GTP, it could also interact with Cdc42-ND. This later binding was increased by phosphorylation and by structural opening of the IQGAP1 C terminus and in the absence of cell-cell contacts. Therefore, we unraveled a new level of regulation for the interaction of IQGAP1 with Cdc42. Our data also suggest that IQGAP1 might act as negative regulator of Cdc42 in single cells. Plasmids and Antibodies—pGEX-6p1-IQGAP1-C1, -C2, and -C3 and pGEX-6p1-IQGAP1-C2-S/E and pGEX-6p1-IQGAP1-C3-S/E (encoding GST fusion proteins) originate from PCRs on human IQGAP1 and PCR-based mutagenesis followed by in vivo recombination, respectively (see Tables I and II). Briefly, PCR fragments of mutated GST-C2 and -C3 were cloned into a BamHI-linearized yeast shuttle vector pCJ36 2Y. Barral, unpublished plasmid and method. followed by recloning (BamHI) of the mutated C2 and C3 into pGEX-6p1. All vectors were sequenced. His-tagged C2 and C2-S/E constructs were obtained by recloning (BamHI) from pGEX-6p1 into pIVEX2.4a. pRSET-Cdc42 (encoding His-tagged Cdc42) was generated (BamHI/EcoRI) from pRK5myc-Cdc42hs. Plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS for expression.

Starvation of cells was performed for 18 h, and stimulation with complete medium was performed for 5 min. If indicated, cells were treated with 2.5 μm Latrunculin B for 30 min. Deprivation of cell-cell contacts was performed for 15 min in the presence of 1 mm pervanadate or for 8–10 h in the presence of 2.5 mm EGTA. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—GST fusion proteins were purified using GSH-Sepharose 4B. For the recombinant GDP displacement assay, GST was cleaved by PreScission Protease. His-C2, -C2-S/E, and -Cdc42 were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and His-Cdc42 was additionally gel-filtrated. All purification methods were according to standard procedures. GST Pull-down Assays—Immobilized GTPase was incubated four times for 10 min at 4 °C in buffer ND.

Confluent or single MCF10A cells were lysed in buffer N or calf intestine phosphatase (CIP) buffer (CIP lysate), respectively. Buffers were prepared with or without phosphatase inhibitors (PI) (1 mm pervanadate, 20 mm NaF). If indicated, CIP lysate without PI was supplemented with 0.8 units of CIP/μg of total protein, and all CIP lysates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cell lysates were supplemented with 20 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm GDP, or 0.5 mm GTPγS and added to ND-, GDP-, and GTPγS-GTPase, respectively. GTPase beads were washed after 1 h with buffer W (for buffers, see Table III).Table IIIBuffers used in experimentsBuffer nameCompositionBuffer A50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (room temperature), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTTBuffer C50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 (25 °C), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTTBuffer E50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (room temperature), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Triton X-100Buffer M50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (room temperature), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Triton X-100, 90 μm GDP or GTPγSBuffer N20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (5 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin ABuffer ND20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (5 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin ABuffer R50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 (25 °C), 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% Triton X-100Buffer W50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (5 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Triton X-100Buffer WN50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (5 °C), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% Triton X-100CIP buffer50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 (25 °C), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin AElution buffer20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (room temperature), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin ANETN buffer20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (5 °C), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% NP-40, 1.4 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 40 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm pervanadate, 20 mm NaF Open table in a new tab Immunoprecipitations—MCF10A cells were lysed in NETN buffer (Table III). For PKCϵ immunoprecipitation, 1% Triton X-100 was added to NETN buffer. Cell lysate was incubated for 2 h with IQGAP1 or overnight with PKCϵ antibodies at 4 °C. Antibodies were precipitated with Protein A-Sepharose and washed with NETN buffer. MS/MS Identification of Proteins and IQGAP1 Phosphorylation— Coomassie-stained gel bands of Cdc42-bound proteins and immunoprecipitated IQGAP1 were cleaved with trypsin as described by Schrimpf et al. (23Schrimpf S.P. Langen H. Gomes A.V. Wahlestedt C. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 1224-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The extracted peptides were analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Individual MS/MS spectra, containing sequence information for a single peptide, were compared with the program TurboSequest against the combined protein sequence databases SwissProt 43.5 and TrEMBL 26.5. This resulted in the identification of the peptides and, by association, the proteins in the lanes. The IQGAP1 phosphopeptide was further analyzed by an MS3 experiment. The peptide ion was isolated and fragmented in the ion trap, where dehydroalanine was formed from phosphoserine. Recombinant Binding to Cdc42-ND—100 pmol of immobilized GST-C3, GST-C3-S/E, and control proteins were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C with 100 pmol of His-Cdc42 in buffer R with or without 5mm EDTA. Samples were washed at 4 °C with buffer WN (for buffers, see Table III). Recombinant Binding Assay—100 pmol of immobilized GST-C1, GST-C2, GST-C3, GST-C3-S/E, and control proteins were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 100 pmol of His-Cdc42-ND, His-Cdc42-GDP, or His-Cdc42-GTPγS and washed at 4 °C with buffer W. Before binding, ND and nucleotide-bound Cdc42 were prepared by incubating 0.9 μm Cdc42 in 1 ml of buffer E and buffer M for 20 min at 30 °C, respectively. 20 mm MgCl2 was added to loaded Cdc42, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and cooled on ice. Unbound nucleotides were removed by desalting columns, and 20 μm nucleotides were added to samples with loaded Cdc42 (for buffers, see Table III). Intramolecular Interaction Assay—100 pmol of immobilized GST-C1 and control proteins were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the indicated amounts of His-C2, His-C2-S/E, and control proteins in buffer WN (Table III) and washed at 4 °C. GDP Displacement Assay—0.84 μm His-Cdc42 was loaded with [8-3H]GDP in buffer A (Table III) plus 5 mm EDTA and 8.4 μm [8-3H]GDP for 20 min at 30 °C. Then 20 mm MgCl2 was added, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and cooled on ice. Unbound nucleotides were removed by desalting columns. Cdc42-[8-3H]GDP was eluted with buffer A. 100 nm immunoprecipitated or recombinant IQGAP1 was mixed with 10 μm GTPγS and 100 nm Cdc42-[8-3H]GDP and transferred to room temperature. The amount of bound radionucleotides at the indicated time points was determined using a nitrocellulose filter-binding method and normalized as the percentage of [8-3H]GDP bound at time 0. For each time point, the samples were assayed in triplicates. Computer Analysis—The algorithm GenTHREADER (24Jones D.T. J. Mol.

IQGAP1 Is an Unconventional Interactor with Cdc42 and Rac1 in Human Epithelial Cells—To identify novel regulators of Cdc42 in epithelial cells, we carried out pull-down experiments using GST-Cdc42 bound to Sepharose beads. To characterize the full spectrum of possible interactors, beads carrying the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Cdc42 as well as the nucleotide-free form of the GTPase were used. The three different forms of Cdc42 were incubated with lysate of confluent breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) in the absence or presence of PI, since phosphorylation frequently regulates protein-protein interactions. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. On these gels, we identified a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 195 kDa whose interaction with the different forms of Cdc42 varied depending on the presence or absence of PI (p195; Fig. 1A). Quantification of five experiments revealed that in the absence of PI p195 bound to all three forms of Cdc42, with a clear preference for Cdc42-GTPγS. In contrast, in the presence of PI p195 bound preferentially to Cdc42-ND. Next, we sought to determine the molecular identity of p195. Purified p195 was partially sequenced using MS/MS analysis and found to correspond to human IQGAP1. The identity of p195 was confirmed by immunoblot using a specific IQGAP1 antibody (Fig. 1B). To determine the specificity, we asked whether IQGAP1 also binds to the nucleotide-free forms of the GTPases Rac1 and RhoA. In the absence of PI, IQGAP1 bound preferentially to the GTPγS forms of Cdc42 and Rac1, as reported before (14Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the presence of PI, IQGAP1 bound predominantly to Cdc42-ND. Weaker binding was detected toward Cdc42-GDP and Cdc42-GTPγS. In addition, IQGAP1 in the presence of PI bound weakly to Rac1-ND and Rac1-GTPγS. IQGAP1 bound more strongly the different forms of Cdc42 than those of Rac1 (the presented expositions can be directly compared). It did not bind to any form of RhoA (Fig. 1B). Thus, a phosphatase activity causes IQGAP1 to behave predominantly as an effector for Cdc42 and Rac1 in confluent MCF10A cells. When this activity was inhibited, IQGAP1 started to bind preferentially the nucleotide-free form of Cdc42. Since IQGAP1 acts as a scaffolding protein that integrates signaling between cell-cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton (28Briggs M.W. Sacks D.B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we tested whether cell-cell contacts regulate phosphorylation-dependent binding of IQGAP1 to Cdc42. Pull-down assays were carried out using lysates of cells deprived of cell-cell contacts either after pervanadate (29Volberg T. Zick Y. Dror R. Sabanay I. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Geiger B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 30Hu P. O'Keefe E.J. Rubenstein D.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 1059-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or EGTA treatment. In these experiments, IQGAP1 bound predominantly to Cdc42-ND regardless of the presence or absence of PI (Fig. 1C, panels Pervanadate, EGTA, and EGTA 1h 37 °C). Treatment of single cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) leads to the formation of cell-cell contacts (31Krendel M. Gloushankova N.A. Bonder E.M. Feder H.H. Vasiliev J.M. Gelfand I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9666-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the binding behavior of IQGAP1 from EGTA-treated cells that were subsequently exposed to PMA (Fig. 1C, panel EGTA → PMA). Under these conditions, IQGAP1 revealed similar binding patterns as in confluent cells (Fig. 1A). These results indicated that the binding of IQGAP1 to Cdc42-ND was reversibly dependent on loss of cell-cell contacts and the absence of a phosphatase in single cells. Indeed, the addition of nonspecific CIP to the cell lysate of single cells prevented the binding of IQGAP1 to Cdc42-ND (Fig. 1C, panel EGTA 1h 37 °C CIP), confirming that this binding was dependent on phosphorylation. Interestingly, phosphatase-treated cell lysate did not prevent the binding of IQGAP1 to Cdc42-GTP, indicating that this interaction was phosphorylation-independent. Taken together, phosphorylation affecting IQGAP1 seemed to be increased in cells lacking cell-cell contacts and was at least in part due to a reduction in phosphatase activity. Direct Phosphorylation of IQGAP1—Since the binding of IQGAP1 to Cdc42-ND was dependent on phosphorylation, we asked whether IQGAP1 was directly phosphorylated. The proprietary fluorescent Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain provides a method for selectively staining phosphoproteins in acrylamide gels. Using this reagent, we compared the phosphostain (P-stain) intensities of IQGAP1 isolated from confluent and single cells (cells deprived of cell contacts) by binding to Cdc42-ND or Cdc42-GTPγS (Fig. 2A). The intensity of the staining was strongest when IQGAP1 was isolated from single versus confluent cells. Likewise, the staining was also enhanced in the fraction of IQGAP1 that bound Cdc42-ND versus Cdc42-GTPγS. MS/MS analysis identified IQGAP1 as the most abundant protein in both P-stained bands (a and c in lane 3). The P-stain signal was absent where IQGAP1 was most abundant (b, lane 3), indicating that only a fraction of IQGAP1 was phosphorylated (Fig. 2, A and B). Since only weaker P-stain was visible when IQGAP1 was isolated from confluent cells and bound to Cdc42-ND and hardly any P-stain was detectable when IQGAP1 was bound to Cdc42-GTPγS, we conclude that IQGAP1 is predominantly phosphorylated in single cells. It is important to mention that the amount of bound IQGAP1 did not always correlate with P-stain intensity (lanes 1 and 2), indicating specificity of the P-stain. Even stronger evidence that the P-stain truly reflected phosphorylation is provided by the absence of P-staining after treatment of Cdc42-ND-bound IQGAP1 with CIP (lane 5). Thus, IQGAP1 bound to Cdc42-ND was phosphorylated. This experiment also indicated that dephosphorylation by CIP was not sufficient to dissociate IQGAP1 from Cdc42-ND. Next we aimed to determine the phosphorylation site in IQGAP1. Starved confluent MCF10A cells were either stimulated with complete medium or not. IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and digested. Analysis of the tryptic peptides by liquid chromatography-MS/MS resulted in sequence coverage of 50–60% for stimulated and nonstimulated samples. Only in the sample of stimulated cells was a phosphopeptide identified. This peptide (SKSVKEDSNLTLQEK) was phosphorylated at position 3 (Ser1443 of IQGAP1) as shown in Fig. 2B. The phosphorylation was confirmed by an MS3 experiment, where dehydroalanine formed from phosphoserine was detected. These experiments revealed Ser1443 as the only detectable phosphorylation site in IQGAP1. Residues 1436–1448 of IQGAP1 are 46% identical and 69% similar to the ideal substrate for PKCϵ (Fig. 2C), suggesting that Ser1443 is a substrate for this kinase (32Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Our data indicated that IQGAP1 was phosphorylated during loss of cell-cell contacts and that PKCϵ is a candidate kinase. Therefore, we investigated whether PKCϵ associated with IQGAP1 in vivo during loss of cell-cell contacts. PKCϵ was immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells treated with EGTA for various amounts of time. Increasing amounts of IQGAP1 co-precipitated with PKCϵ as loss of cell-cell contacts progressed, but not with IgG alone (Fig. 2D). Thus, during the generation of single cells, PKCϵ interacts with IQGAP1 and may phosphorylate it. This phosphorylation could cause the increased binding of IQGAP1 to Cdc42-ND observed in cells deprived of cell-cell contacts. IQGAP1 Phosphorylation Increases Direct Binding to Cdc42-ND—Our analysis of interactions between IQGAP1 and Cdc42 indicated that IQGAP1 bound to Cdc42-ND and was phosphorylated at a C-terminal serine residue. To determine whether this binding was direct and whether it was regulated by the phosphorylation on Ser1443, we employed an in vitro binding assay using recombinant fragments of IQGAP1 and recombinant Cdc42. Plasmids encoding GST fusion C-terminal fragments of IQGAP1 were generated (Fig. 6A). Two fragments were tested, C3 (aa 956–1657) and an analogous fragment in which Ser1443 was mutated to Glu to mimic phosphorylation (C3-S/E). Isolated nucleotide-depleted GTPases are structurally unstable and tend to denature. To test whether the interaction IQGAP1-Cdc42 occurs under nucleotide-depleted conditions, we used an assay developed by Beraud-Dufour et al. (33Beraud-Dufour S. Paris S. Chabre M. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37629-37636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this method, nucleotide depletion is directly coupled with stabilization of the depleted GTPase through the binding of a second interactor, an approach that copies a GEF reaction. Immobilized C3 or C3-S/E was incubated with an equal molar ratio of bacterially purified His-tagged Cdc42 in the presence of EDTA, CIP, or both together. EDTA chelates Mg2+ and therefore destabilizes nucleotides bound to GTPases. CIP hydrolyzes phosphate groups, abolishing the presence of nucleotides. In the presence of CIP, EDTA, or both, the C-terminal IQGAP1 fragments bound Cdc42. In contrast, in the absence of CIP and EDTA, neither IQGAP1 fragment bound Cdc42 significantly, supporting the assumption that bacterially expressed Cdc42 is predominantly GDP-bound (Fig. 3A). To test the specificity of this interaction, we incubated Cdc42 with GST-PAK1-CRIB (GST-CRIB), which binds specifically to Cdc42-GTP, and GST alone. As expected, neither GST nor GST-PAK1-CRIB bound Cdc42 in these assays, indicating that the binding of Cdc42 to the GST-C3 and GST-C3S/E fragments was specific. Thus, Cdc42-ND bound directly to both recombinant C-terminal fragments of IQGAP1. We next examined whether the phosphorylation on Ser1443 might alter the kinetic of the interaction of C3 with Cdc42-ND. The binding of phospho-mimicking C3-S/E and nonphosphorylated C3 toward Cdc42 was compared over time. This assay was performed as before in an equal molar ratio in the presence of EDTA, and samples were taken after 6, 8, 15, 20, and 30 min (Fig. 3B). The phospho-mimicking fragments bound more Cdc42-ND over time than the wild type fr"

ADAMTS10 has the typical modular organization of the ADAMTS family, with five thrombospondin type 1 repeats and a cysteine-rich PLAC (protease and lacunin) domain at the carboxyl terminus. Its domain organization and primary structure is similar to a novel long form of ADAMTS6. In contrast to many ADAMTS proteases, ADAMTS10 is widely expressed in adult tissues and throughout mouse embryo development. In situ hybridization analysis showed widespread expression of Adamts10 in the mouse embryo until 12.5 days of gestation, after which it is then expressed in a more restricted fashion, with especially strong expression in developing lung, bone, and craniofacial region. Mesenchymal, not epithelial, expression in the developing lung, kidney, gonad, salivary gland, and gastrointestinal tract is a consistent feature of Adamts10 regulation. N-terminal sequencing and treatment with decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone indicate that the ADAMTS10 zymogen is processed by a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase at two sites (Arg64↓Gly and Arg233↓Ser). The widespread expression of ADAMTS10 suggests that furin, a ubiquitously expressed proprotein convertase, is the likely processing enzyme. ADAMTS10 expressed in HEK293F and COS-1 cells is N-glycosylated and is secreted into the medium, as well as sequestered at the cell surface and extracellular matrix, as demonstrated by cell surface biotinylation and immunolocalization in nonpermeabilized cells.

Proteases that cleave such molecules thus play important roles in tissue remodeling, morphogenesis, inflammatory and degenerative diseases, and cancer. Zinc-metalloendopeptidases (metalloproteases) comprise an important superfamily of such enzymes. Specific roles for distinct metalloprotease families and their individual members have emerged over the past decade through genetic studies in humans and mice. Matrix metalloproteases are the major ECM-degrading enzymes, but they also have a role in proteolysis of other secreted molecules and cell surface proteins (1Somerville R.P. Oblander S.A. Apte S.S.

ADAMTS proteases are modular, consisting of a protease domain and an ancillary domain (23Apte S.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The protease domain of these enzymes, like that of ADAMs, but not MMPs, is of the reprolysin (snake venom) type. The hallmark of the ADAMTS proteases is the presence of at least one thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR). Other highly conserved modules are arranged around this central TSR in a specific organization, and there are additional TSRs near the carboxyl terminus in all members of the ADAMTS family with the exception of ADAMTS4 (23Apte S.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). ADAMTS proteases are synthesized as zymogens that are targeted to the secretory pathway and activated by proprotein convertases. Zymogen processing leads to removal of a 200–220-amino acid-long prodomain in the secretory pathway or at the cell surface. 19 mammalian ADAMTS proteases are known, and all except ADAMTS10, the subject of this article, have previously been described in the literature. Within the ADAMTS family, subsets of proteases have highly conserved domain organization, primary sequence and gene structure, suggestive of a close evolutionary and perhaps functional relationship (7Fernandes R.J.

In this context, determination of the primary structure of ADAMTS10 led to realization of a putative long form of ADAMTS6, whose domain organization and primary structure support the contention that it forms a phylogenetic subset with ADAMTS10. Unlike most other ADAMTS proteases, including ADAMTS6 (24Hurskainen T.L. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. J. Biol.

ADAMTS10 is shown to be a functional metalloprotease, although its physiological substrates are presently unknown. cDNA Cloning of Human and Mouse ADAMTS10 —Using the tBLASTn (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, we searched the data base of expressed sequence tags (dBEST), using the protein sequences of a number of ADAMTS proteases, and identified similarities in a human EST (GenBank™ accession number AA588434) derived from the human prostate-derived IMAGE clone 1101403. The IMAGE clone was purchased (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), and the insert was sequenced in its entirety. Oligonucleotide primers based on the sequences at the ends of this clone were used with human fetal brain cDNA (Marathon cDNA, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as a template to perform iterative rapid amplification of cDNA ends by PCR at 5′- and 3′-ends, essentially as previously described (24Hurskainen T.L.

Nucleotide sequencing was done at the National Institutes of Health-supported Molecular Biotechnology Core of the Lerner Research Institute (Cleveland Clinic Foundation), and nucleotide sequence data were analyzed using Lasergene software (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI). Integration of the overlapping sequences provided the complete ORF and primary sequence of human ADAMTS10. To confirm that the overlapping human cDNAs were derived from a single transcript, we designed PCR primers incorporating the most 5′ cloned human sequence and the stop codon of the ADAMTS10 ORF (forward primer, 5′-AAGAATTCAGAGACATGTGGACACGTGG-3′ (EcoRI site underlined, start codon in boldface type); reverse primer, 5′-AAGTCGACCGAGTGGCCCTGGCAGGTTTTGC-3′ (SalI site underlined, modified stop codon (to Ser) in boldface type)). PCR was done using human fetal lung cDNA or human lung cancer cell line A549 cDNA as templates (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and using the following conditions: 95 °C for 1 min and then 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 5 min. The resulting 3.2-kbp amplicon was gel-purified, ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced. The mouse IMAGE clone 1077653 (EST AA822090) was detected in GenBank™ as a presumptive Adamts10 clone, 2Gene nomenclature has been assigned in agreement with the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee. ADAMTS10 and Adamts10 are human and mouse orthologs. The protein products of both genes are designated as ADAMTS10. Similar nomenclature is used for other ADAMTS genes and their products. purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL), and its 1.6-kbp insert was sequenced in its entirety. Additional 5′ mouse cDNA sequence was deduced from mouse genomic sequences (available with GenBank™ accession numbers AC073802 and AC073766), using the GENSCAN program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (available on the World Wide Web at CCR-081.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) to predict the exons in these sequences. The complete mouse ADAMTS10 ORF was amplified by PCR of mouse 17.5-day-old embryo cDNA in similar fashion to that described above for the human cDNA. Northern Analysis—Mouse embryo Northern blots and multiple tissue Northern blots from adult human and mouse tissues and from human cancer cell lines (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, and Seegene Inc.) were hybridized to the [α-32P]dCTP-labeled inserts of human and mouse ADAMTS10 IMAGE clones, as per the manufacturer's recommendations, followed by autoradiographic exposure for 4 days. In Situ Hybridization—Adamts10 IMAGE clone 1077653 was digested with StuI and XhoI to delete 792 bp of the 1642-bp insert. The plasmid containing the remainder was blunt-ended with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and religated to obtain an 850-bp Adamts10 cDNA encoding part of the cysteine-rich domain, spacer domain, and first two TSRs (plasmid 1077653X1). This plasmid was used to transcribe sense and antisense cRNA probes continuously labeled with [35S]UTP. Paraffin sections of formaldehyde-fixed mouse embryos of age 9.5, 12.5, 14.5, 15.5, and 17.5 days were hybridized to the Adamts10 probes as previously described (20Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M.

Adamts10 autoradiographic signal was visualized with dark field microscopy, whereas cell nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Hoechst 33258 dye; Sigma), which fluoresces blue under UV light. ADAMTS10 Expression Plasmids—The preprocatalytic coding region of human ADAMTS10 (ADAMTS10-(1–463)) was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-AAGAATTCGGCCTCTATGGCTCCCGCC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AAGTCGACCACAAAGTCCTGTCTGGG-3′ (reverse primer; introduced SalI site is underlined) and Advantage 2 high fidelity polymerase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The PCR products were gel-purified and ligated to the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The insert of a sequence-verified clone was then ligated into the EcoRI and XhoI site of pcDNAmyc His A+ (Invitrogen) for expression of ADAMTS10-(1–463) with a C-terminal tandem myc and His6 tag. The full-length ADAMTS10 cDNA described above was cloned in frame with a C-terminal tandem myc and His6 tag Transfection and Selection of Stable Cell Lines—HEK293F cells (Invitrogen) at 80% confluence were transfected in 6-well plates with 100 ng of full-length ADAMTS10 or ADAMTS10-(1–463) expression plasmid DNA using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) as per manufacturer's instructions. At the first medium change, it was supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). Discrete colonies were isolated using cloning discs (PGC Scientific, Frederick, MD) and expanded. Western blotting with anti-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Invitrogen) was used to determine the level of protein expression in the media of these clones. Expression and Characterization of ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS10-(1–463)—Stably transfected cells expressing full-length ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS10-(1–463) were cultured in three-tier flasks (Nunc, Rochester, NY) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When cultures were 80% confluent, the serum-containing medium was replaced with serum-free 293CD medium (Invitrogen) followed by further culture at 37 °C in the presence of 8% CO2 for 5 days. Conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged briefly to remove cellular debris, and supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 m. ProBond resin (Invitrogen) was prepared by washing with 1 bed volume of binding buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8). The media and resin were mixed overnight at 4 °C in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio in binding buffer. After this binding step, the resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g and then washed five times with 10 resin bed volumes of binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by sequential washes with binding buffer containing 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mm imidazole. The washes and eluted protein fractions were assayed for the presence and purity of desired proteins by Western blotting (using anti-myc monoclonal antibody) and by reducing SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining, respectively. Maximal yield was obtained on elution in 100–250 mm imidazole. Following purification of ADAMTS10-(1–463), major bands of ∼52, ∼50, and ∼29 kDa were excised after electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. N-terminal sequence was determined by Edman degradation at the National Institutes of Health-supported Biotechnology Core of the Lerner Research Institute. For identification of the zymogen-processing enzyme, ADAMTS10-(1–463)-expressing cells were treated with increasing concentrations (1–100 μm) of the lipid-permeable furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (dec-RVKR-cmk) (Calbiochem) for 24 h, and secreted protein was detected by Western blot analysis of conditioned medium as previously described (22Somerville R.P.

https://openalex.org/W2020909272,"Binding of β-arrestins to seven-membrane-spanning receptors (7MSRs) not only leads to receptor desensitization and endocytosis but also elicits additional signaling processes. We recently proposed that stimulation of the angiotensin type 1A (AT1A) receptor results in independent β-arrestin 2- and G protein-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activation. Here we utilize two AT1A mutant receptors to study these independent pathways, one truncated at residue 324, thus removing all potential carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites, and the other bearing four mutations in the serine/threonine-rich clusters in the carboxyl terminus. As assessed by confocal microscopy, the two mutant receptors interacted with β-arrestin 2-green fluorescent protein with much lower affinity than did the wild-type receptor. In addition, the mutant receptors more robustly stimulated G protein-mediated inositol phosphate production. Approximately one-half of the wild-type AT1A receptor-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was via a β-arrestin 2-dependent pathway (suppressed by β-arrestin 2 small interfering RNA), whereas the rest was mediated by a G protein-dependent pathway (suppressed by protein kinase C inhibitor). ERK1/2 activation by the mutant receptors was insensitive to β-arrestin 2 small interfering RNA but was reduced more than 80% by a protein kinase C inhibitor. The biochemical consequences of ERK activation by the G protein and β-arrestin 2-dependent pathways were also distinct. G-protein-mediated ERK activation enhanced the transcription of early growth response 1, whereas β-arrestin 2-dependent ERK activation did not. In addition, stimulation of the truncated AT1A mutant receptor caused significantly greater early growth response 1 transcription than did the wild-type receptor. These findings demonstrate how the ability of receptors to interact with β-arrestins determines both the mechanism of ERK activation as well as the physiological consequences of this activation.

Phosphorylation of 7MSRs has been shown to occur primarily in the carboxyl-terminal tail (C-tail) and to be critical for stable and high affinity arrestin binding (1Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V.

Binding of arrestins not only mediates 7MSR desensitization by physically preventing the interaction between G protein and receptor but also initiates receptor internalization. Some receptors, such as the AT1A receptor and V2 vasopressin receptor, bind β-arrestins tightly and internalize with them into endosomal vesicles (“class B”) (4Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A.

These patterns are easily distinguishable by confocal microscopy. Upon agonist stimulation, the AT1A receptor is phosphorylated on its carboxyl terminus by GRKs and protein kinase C (PKC) (5Qian H.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1706-1719PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, there are also three distinct serine/threonine-rich regions in the COOH terminus. The most carboxyl-terminal of these regions (Ser346, Ser347, Ser348) appears to play a minimal role in β-arrestin binding (2Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1706-1719PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mutations in either the most amino-terminal region (Ser328, Ser329, Ser331, Thr332) or the middle region (Ser335, Thr336, Ser338) change the pattern of β-arrestin 2-GFP recruitment from class B to class A, suggesting that these two regions are important for β-arrestin 2 binding (2Oakley R.H.

Consistent with this, alanine substitutions for Thr332, Ser335, Thr336, and Ser338 of the AT1A receptor result in a marked decrease in agonist-induced β-arrestin 1 association (3Qian H. Pipolo L. Thomas W.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1706-1719PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, an AT1A mutant receptor truncated at residue 325, which lacks all of the serine and threonine residues of the carboxyl terminus and shows no agonist-dependent phosphorylation (5Qian H. Pipolo L. Thomas W.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), lacks the ability to interact with β-arrestin 1 in an agonist dependent manner as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation (3Qian H. Pipolo L. Thomas W.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1706-1719PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that β-arrestins also scaffold signaling pathways such as those leading to mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. In particular, β-arrestins have been shown to form complexes with the AT1A, neurokinin receptor 1, and V2 vasopressin receptors, which scaffold and facilitate the activation of the ERK kinase cascade (RAF, MEK, ERK) while targeting the activated ERK to endocytic vesicles in the cytoplasm (7Tohgo A.

We recently showed that stimulation of a mutant AT1A receptor (DRY/AAY) with angiotensin II (Ang II) or a wild-type receptor with an Ang II analog ([Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]Ang II) fails to activate classical heterotrimeric G protein signaling but does lead to β-arrestin 2 recruitment and ERK1/2 activation (10Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). In addition, depletion of cellular β-arrestin 2 via siRNA completely abolishes such G protein-independent activation of ERK1/2. Thus the DRY/AAY mutant AT1A receptor and [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]Ang II mutant ligand appear to be selective for the β-arrestin 2-dependent G protein-independent pathway leading to ERK1/2 activation. Here we set out to develop corresponding AT1A receptor mutants capable of activating only G protein and independent of β-arrestin 2-mediated signaling; this was accomplished by mutating the carboxyl-terminal GRK phosphorylation sites in the receptor that are thought to be necessary for high affinity β-arrestin binding. This approach also permitted us to explore the correlation between β-arrestin/receptor interactions and β-arrestin-mediated ERK1/2 signaling.

Construction of AT1A Receptor Mutants—Mutant AT1A receptors were generated by mutagenesis PCR using pcDNA3.1-HA-AT1A receptor as a template and a QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers for TSTS/A and 324Δ mutant receptors were 5′ p-CTCAAGCCTGTCTGCGAAAATGGCCGCTTGCTTACCGGCCTTC 3′ and 5′ p-CCCCCAAAGGCCTAGTCCCACTCAAGCC 3′, respectively. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—HEK-293 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and a 1% penicillin/streptomycin mixture (Sigma). Cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inositol Phosphate Determination—Transiently transfected HEK-293 cells in 10-cm dishes were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well plates (BD Biosciences). To assay for inositol phosphate (IP) production, cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in labeling medium (1 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol in 0.5 ml of Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum/well). Cells were washed with 20 mm HEPES containing 20 mm LiCl for 20 min at 37 °C and then treated with different concentrations of Ang II for 20 min. Total inositol phosphates were extracted and separated as described previously (12Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1633-1639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). siRNA Transfection—HEK-293 cells were simultaneously transfected in 10-cm dishes with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1-HA-AT1A receptor or 3 μg of TSTS/A or 324Δ mutant AT1A receptor plasmids and 20 μg of β-arrestin 2 siRNA or control siRNA as described previously (13Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Similar receptor expression levels (150–200 fmol of receptors/mg of protein) were obtained under these experimental conditions as measured by radioligand binding. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were divided into 6-well plates, and cellular extracts were prepared three days after transfection. Confocal Microscopy—HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected in 10-cm dishes with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1-HA-AT1A receptor or 3 μg of TSTS/A or 324Δ mutant AT1A receptor plasmids and 0.3 μg of the β-arrestin 2-GFP plasmid. One day after transfection, cells were split onto collagen-coated 35-mm plastic dishes with glass bottoms (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and cultured overnight at 37 °C. Confocal microscopy was performed at ×100 magnification with a Zeiss laser-scanning microscope (LSM-510). Images were collected using a 488-nm excitation and 515–540-nm emission filter. Preparation of Cellular Extracts and Immunoblotting—Cells in 6-well plates were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 100 μm benzaminidine. Proteins were separated on 10% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Phosphorylated ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and β-arrestin 2 were detected by immunoblotting with a phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., 1:3000), an anti-MAPK1/2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 1:10,000), and a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-arrestin 2 antibody, A2CT (1:5000), respectively. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce), and phosphorylated ERK1/2 immunoblots were quantified by densitometry with a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was purified from cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA was then used to generate cDNA using an Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). For each PCR reaction, cDNAs corresponding to 300 ng of total RNA were used. Real time PCR was performed using a SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a Mx3000P™ real time PCR system (Stratagene). PCR reactions were carried out by incubating reactions at 95 °C for 10 min to inactive the reverse transcriptases and activate the DNA polymerase. Forty-five standard PCR cycles were carried out at 95 °C for 30 s for denaturing, 58 °C for 30 s for annealing, and 72 °C for 20 s for extension. Primers for human EGR-1 were CAGCACCTTCAACCCTCAG (sense) and CACAAGGTGTTGCCACTGTT (antisense). Additionally, real time reverse transcription-PCR for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was conducted as a reference for normalization. Primers for GAPDH were ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC (sense) and TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA (antisense) In each experiment, reverse transcription-PCR reactions for both EGR-1 and GAPDH were performed in triplicate for each RNA sample. The average threshold cycle values for EGR-1 were normalized to the threshold cycle value of GAPDH and converted to a linear scale. To generate mutant AT1A receptors that are defective in their ability to associate with β-arrestin 2, we mutated the carboxyl-terminal sites in the receptor thought to be necessary for high affinity β-arrestin binding. The two mutant AT1A receptors created were TSTS/A, which has alanine substitutions for Thr332, Ser335, Thr336, and Ser338, and 324Δ, which truncates the AT1A receptor from residue 325 and lacks all of the serine and threonine residues at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1A). To test whether TSTS/A and 324Δ mutant receptors were defective in their ability to associate with β-arrestin 2, we examined the ability of wild-type, TSTS/A, and 324Δ mutant AT1A receptors to interact with β-arrestin 2-GFP upon agonist stimulation using confocal microscopy. Ang II induced translocation of β-arrestin 2-GFP to endocytic vesicles (class B pattern) in cells expressing wild-type AT1A receptors (Fig. 1B), demonstrating a stable interaction between β-arrestin 2-GFP and internalized AT1A receptors (2Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Conversely, in cells expressing TSTS/A mutant receptor, Ang II induced translocation of β-arrestin 2-GFP only to the plasma membrane (class A pattern) (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with the previous report that the mutated serine/threonine sites are important for the high affinity binding of β-arrestin (2Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 3Qian H. Pipolo L. Thomas W.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1706-1719PubMed Google Scholar). Ang II also induced translocation of β-arrestin 2-GFP to the plasma membrane in cells expressing the 324Δ mutant receptor but in a pattern that seemed weaker than the classic class A pattern of β-arrestin 2 recruitment (Fig. 1B) (4Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of AT1A receptors is not thought to be critical for G protein coupling (14Thomas W.G. Regul. Pept. 1999; 79: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, both TSTS/A and 324Δ mutant receptors still coupled efficiently to G proteins as indicated by inositol phosphate production turnover assay (Fig. 2). In fact, both mutant receptors mediated somewhat greater constitutive and agonist-stimulated IP production than the wild-type receptor. Both the affinity and maximum activity of the mutant receptors were also increased (Fig. 2). This presumably reflects impaired β-arrestin-mediated desensitization. Thus, both the TSTS/A and 324Δ receptors are defective in their ability to associate with β-arrestin 2 while retaining the ability to interact with G protein. We have previously proposed that the AT1A receptor can stimulate ERK1/2 activation by two pathways mediated, respectively, by G protein and β-arrestin 2 (10Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Because both TSTS/A and 324Δ can still couple to G protein, activation of G protein-mediated ERK1/2 should not be compromised for either of these two mutant receptors. Consistent with this idea, stimulation of wild-type AT1A receptor, TSTS/A, and 324Δ mutant receptors with Ang II all led to robust ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3, A and B), which, if anything, was increased with the mutant receptors. To determine the role of β-arrestin 2 in the activation of ERK1/2 by these mutant receptors, we compared the effect of β-arrestin 2 siRNA on the ERK1/2 activation induced by the wild-type AT1A receptor, TSTS/A, or 324Δ mutant receptors. Down-regulation of β-arrestin 2 significantly decreased the ERK1/2 activation induced by wild-type AT1A receptor by ∼50–60% (Fig. 3, A and C) as reported previously (10Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). This suggests that about one-half of the ERK1/2 activation by the wild-type AT1A receptor is mediated by β-arrestin 2. In contrast, no significant inhibition in the ERK1/2 activation was observed when either of the mutant receptors was stimulated with Ang II in β-arrestin 2 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A and C). These results indicate that ERK1/2 activated by TSTS/A or 324Δ mutant receptors is largely independent of β-arrestin 2 and mediated primarily by G proteins. In addition, these results demonstrate a good correlation between the ability of β-arrestin 2 to interact with the receptors (as observed by confocal microscopy) and the ability of the receptors to mediate β-arrestin 2-dependent ERK1/2 activation. We have shown previously that the G protein-mediated ERK1/2 activation by the wild-type AT1A receptor in HEK-293 cells requires activation of PKC, whereas the β-arrestin 2-dependent ERK1/2 activation does not (10Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). If the ERK1/2 activation induced by TSTS/A or 324Δ mutant receptor is mostly dependent on the G protein-mediated pathway, then ERK1/2 activation induced by these mutant receptors should be more sensitive to PKC inhibition than activation induced by the wild-type AT1A receptor. As predicted, pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8425 inhibited the wild-type AT1A receptor-stimulated ERK1/2 activation by ∼55%, whereas it inhibited TSTS/A or 324Δ mutant receptor-stimulated ERK1/2 activation by >80% (Fig. 4, A and B). A combination of β-arrestin 2 siRNA and Ro-31-8425 almost completely abolished the activation of ERK1/2 induced by the wild-type AT1A receptor as well as TSTS/A and 324Δ mutant receptors (Fig. 4, C and D). Ang II-induced EGR-1 transcription is mediated by ERK1/2 in vascular smooth muscle cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells (15Guillemot L. Levy A. Raymondjean M. Rothhut B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39394-39403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Day F.L. Rafty L.A. Chesterman C.N. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23726-23733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ang II-induced transcription of EGR-1 is ERK1/2-dependent in HEK-293 cells, we tested the effect of U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK, just upstream of ERK1/2, on Ang II-induced EGR-1 transcription. Pretreatment with U0126 completely abolished Ang II-induced ERK1/2 activation by the wild-type AT1A receptor (data not shown) and inhibited >97.3 ± 12.3% (n = 3) of Ang II-induced EGR-1 transcription, indicating that Ang II-induced transcription of EGR-1 is dependent on ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells. Because mitogen-induced gene expression requires nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 (17Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), Ang II-induced transcription of EGR-1 is a valid indication of nuclear ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells. It has been demonstrated previously that β-arrestins facilitate 7MSR-mediated ERK activation but retain activated phospho-ERK1/2 in the cytosol, which is incapable of inducing ERK-dependent transcription (7Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 8Tohgo A. Choy E.W. Gesty-Palmer D.

Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 19Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Thus, we would expect that G protein-dependent phospho-ERK1/2 translocates to the nucleus, leading to ERK-dependent transcription, whereas the β-arrestin 2-dependent phospho-ERK1/2 remains in the cytosol and cannot activate ERK-dependent transcription. To determine whether the induction of EGR-1 transcription by Ang II is mediated by the G protein-dependent but not by β-arrestin 2-dependent phospho-ERK1/2, we tested the effect of the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8425 on the induction of EGR-1 transcription by Ang II. Stimulation of wild-type AT1A receptors with Ang II for 1 h led to an almost 22-fold increase in EGR-1 transcripts (Fig. 5). Pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor all but abolished this induction, suggesting that stimulation of EGR-1 transcription by Ang II is mediated by the G protein-dependent phospho-ERK. To further confirm that the β-arrestin 2-dependent phospho-ERK1/2 is unable to enhance transcription of EGR-1, we tested the ability of [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]Ang II, which we have previously shown to activate ERK1/2 only via the β-arrestin 2-dependent pathway and not by the G protein-dependent pathway (10Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), to induce EGR-1 transcription. Stimulation of wild-type AT1A receptors with [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]Ang II did not lead to a significant increase in EGR-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 5A). The β-arrestin 2-activated phospho-ERK1/2 pool is confined to the cytoplasm (7Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 8Tohgo A. Choy E.W. Gesty-Palmer D. Pierce K.L. Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expect that β-arrestin 2 siRNA would not decrease the Ang II-induced EGR-1 transcription even though it leads to a significant decline in cellular phospho-ERK1/2 (Figs. 3 and 4). Consistent with this expectation, β-arrestin 2 siRNA did not significantly change the Ang II-induced EGR-1 transcription (Fig. 5B). The 324Δ and TSTS/A mutant AT1A receptors are defective in their ability to tightly bind β-arrestins (Fig. 1B) and are more capable of stimulating G protein signaling than the wildtype receptor (Fig. 2). Thus, they might be expected to induce EGR-1 transcription even more strongly than the wild-type AT1A receptor. Consistent with our IP production data, a significant increase in the basal EGR-1 transcripts was observed in cells expressing TSTS/A or 324Δ mutant AT1A receptor (Fig. 5C). In addition, stimulation of the 324Δ mutant AT1A receptor with Ang II for 1 h led to a significant increase in the amount of EGR-1 transcripts as compared with the amount of EGR-1 transcripts induced by stimulation of the wild-type AT1A receptor (Fig. 5C), whereas TSTS/A induced an intermediate level of EGR-1 transcripts. We have previously proposed that the AT1A receptor can induce ERK1/2 activation through two independent pathways mediated by G protein and β-arrestin 2, respectively (10Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Here we provide support for this idea by showing that the nature of the interaction between β-arrestin 2 and the AT1A receptor is determinative for β-arrestin 2-mediated ERK1/2 activation. Using EGR-1 mRNA as an indicator for nuclear ERK1/2 activation, we further show that G protein-mediated ERK1/2 activation induces EGR-1 transcription, whereas β-arrestin 2-mediated ERK1/2 activation does not. Not only is this consistent with previous reports that β-arrestins sequester phospho-ERK1/2 in the cytosol (7Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 18DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), but it is also indicative of a clear functional divergence in the consequence of ERK1/2 activation by the two pathways. Although several cytosolic proteins such as GRK2, Bcl2, and tau are regulated by ERK1/2 phosphorylation (20Elorza A. Penela P. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29164-29173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell.

Brain Pathol. 2003; 13: 440-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), the physiological substrates of the cytosolic phospho-ERK1/2 activated by β-arrestin 2 remain unknown. Nevertheless, it is clear that the β-arrestin 2- and G protein-mediated signaling pathways have different physiological consequences. The 324Δ mutant receptor lacks all the phosphorylation sites in its C-tail and cannot be phosphorylated in response to Ang II stimulation (5Qian H. Pipolo L. Thomas W.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, our confocal data clearly indicate that this mutant receptor can recruit β-arrestin 2 to the plasma membrane in an agonist-dependent manner. These results show that β-arrestin 2 can bind to AT1A receptors in a phosphorylation-independent manner, albeit with lower affinity. However, in the case of AT1A receptors, this phosphorylation-independent binding of β-arrestin 2 does not apparently trigger ERK1/2 activation. Although phosphorylation of the C-tail appears to be required for high affinity binding of β-arrestins (2Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 3Qian H. Pipolo L. Thomas W.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1706-1719PubMed Google Scholar), several receptors have been reported to interact with β-arrestins through the third intracellular loop. For example, both the third intracellular loop and the C-tail are important for β-arrestin binding to the neurokinin receptor 1 (23Schmidlin F. Roosterman D. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C945-C958Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), delta opioid receptor (24Cen B. Yu Q. Guo J. Wu Y. Ling K. Cheng Z. Ma L. Pei G. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1887-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Cen B. Xiong Y. Ma L. Pei G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (26Bhaskaran R.S. Min L. Krishnamurthy H. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13950-13959Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In each case, Ser/Thr residues in the third intracellular loop also appear to be critical for β-arrestin binding. However, we found that an AT1A mutant receptor with alanine substitutions for all three Ser/Thr residues in the third intracellular loop showed no difference in recruiting β-arrestin 2-GFP compared with the wild-type AT1A receptor (data not shown). In addition, an AT1A mutant receptor-combining truncation of the C-tail and alanine substitutions for all three Ser/Thr residues in the third intracellular loop can still recruit β-arrestin 2-GFP to the plasma membrane in an agonist-dependent manner (data not shown). Together with previous reports that a C-tail truncation mutant of AT1A receptor at residue 325 cannot be phosphorylated upon Ang II stimulation (3Qian H. Pipolo L. Thomas W.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1706-1719PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that the phosphorylation-independent association of β-arrestin 2 with the AT1A receptor is driven by conformational changes in the receptor, which occur upon agonist binding. Such a conformational change-dependent recruitment of β-arrestins is not unique. For example, the interaction between β-arrestin 2 and the lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor depends mostly on receptor activation rather than on receptor phosphorylation (27Min L. Galet C. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 702-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and an Asp residue in the third intracellular loop is important for β-arrestin 2 binding to this receptor (28Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Preninger A. Hamm H.E. Bader M.F. Fazleabas A.T. Birnbaumer L. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17916-17927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At first glance, the pattern of agonist-dependent recruitment of β-arrestin 2-GFP to the plasma membrane by the 324Δ mutant receptor is similar to the pattern of β-arrestin 2-GFP recruitment by class A receptors (4Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). However, the binding of β-arrestin 2 to 324Δ mutant receptors and the binding of β-arrestin 2 to a class A receptor might be fundamentally different because β-arrestin 2 recruitment by a class A receptor, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor, is primarily dependent on receptor phosphorylation (29Lohse M.J. Andexinger S. Pitcher J. Trukawinski S. Codina J. Faure J.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8558-8564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inability of TSTS/A and 324Δ mutant receptors to stably interact with β-arrestins resulted in dramatic inhibition of receptor internalization and increased IP production (3Qian H. Pipolo L. Thomas W.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1706-1719PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, G protein-mediated ERK1/2 activation was augmented, further reducing the role of the β-arrestin 2-dependent pathway. This may explain why the proportion of β-arrestin 2-dependent ERK1/2 activation induced by stimulation of the TSTS/A or 324Δ mutant receptors is so low, making it hard to detect by the β-arrestin 2 siRNA method. Our data further suggest that the low affinity association of β-arrestin 2 with the AT1A receptor, which is not dependent on receptor phosphorylation, is less able to initiate β-arrestin 2-dependent signaling and that a high affinity state of β-arrestin 2 binding, which requires receptor phosphorylation, is necessary for β-arrestin 2-dependent signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2020069648,"Protein palmitoylation plays a critical role in sorting and targeting of several proteins to pre- and postsynaptic sites. In this study, we have analyzed the role of palmitoylation in trafficking of synaptotagmin I and its modulation by synaptic activity. We found that palmitoylation of N-terminal cysteines contributed to sorting of synaptotagmin I to an intracellular vesicular compartment at the presynaptic terminal. Presynaptic targeting is a unique feature of N-terminal sequences of synaptotagmin I because the palmitoylated N terminus of synaptotagmin VII failed to localize to presynaptic sites. We also found that palmitate was stably associated with both synaptotagmin I and SNAP-25 and that rapid neuronal depolarization did not affect palmitate turnover on these proteins. However, long-term treatment with drugs that either block synaptic activity or disrupt SNARE complex assembly modulated palmitoylation and accumulation of synaptotagmin I at presynaptic sites. We conclude that palmitoylation is involved in trafficking of specific elements involved in transmitter release and that distinct mechanisms regulate addition and removal of palmitate on select neuronal proteins.

We also found that palmitate was stably associated with both synaptotagmin I and SNAP-25 and that rapid neuronal depolarization did not affect palmitate turnover on these proteins. However, long-term treatment with drugs that either block synaptic activity or disrupt SNARE complex assembly modulated palmitoylation and accumulation of synaptotagmin I at presynaptic sites. We conclude that palmitoylation is involved in trafficking of specific elements involved in transmitter release and that distinct mechanisms regulate addition and removal of palmitate on select neuronal proteins. Synaptic transmission requires appropriate protein targeting and assembly of pre- and postsynaptic elements. Protein sorting to distinct domains in polarized cells appears to begin in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network, where proteins can segregate and exit in separate transport vesicles (1Bradke F. Dotti C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One mechanism that regulates protein trafficking is palmitoylation, a post-translational modification involving the addition of palmitate, a 16-carbon fatty acid, via a labile thioester linkage (2Resh M.D. Cell.

Palmitoylation of the AMPA receptor-binding protein and PSD-95 is essential for clustering at the PSD (8Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S.

Acylation of several other axonal proteins as well as proteins associated with neurotransmitter release machinery has been recently reported (5Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 6El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Nat. Rev.

These include members of the synaptotagmin family that regulate synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release (14Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 15Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The synaptotagmin family includes 13 members characterized by a unique N-terminal region followed by a transmembrane domain, a cluster of cysteines (the putative palmitoylation site), a variable domain, and two C-terminal C2 domains (15Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 16Chapman E.R. Blasi J. An S. Brose N. Johnston P.A. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Biochem. Biophys.

Schmidt M.F. Veit M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin I, the most characterized member of the family, is proposed to act as a Ca2+ sensor for regulated exocytosis (19Fernandez-Chacon R. Konigstorfer A. Gerber S.H. Garcia J. Matos M.F. Stevens C.F. Brose N. Rizo J. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Other abundant members of the family include synaptotagmins III and VII (15Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Interestingly, synaptotagmin I is localized to synaptic vesicles, whereas synaptotagmin VII is localized on the plasma membrane opposite synaptic vesicle docking sites (15Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Despite the striking differences in their subcellular distribution, the mechanisms involved in differential sorting of individual members of the synaptotagmin family remain unclear. SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa) is another palmitoylated protein that is involved in regulated release of neurotransmitters at the presynaptic terminal (20Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The palmitoylated cysteines are contained within the linker region between the N- and C-terminal helices involved in association with the core synaptic fusion complex. Recent studies showed that palmitoylation of SNAP-25 relies on the secretory pathway and that acylation of SNAP-25 anchors the protein to the membrane (22Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Membrane targeting of SNAP-25 also relies on association with the SNARE protein syntaxin (24Vogel K. Roche P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Veit M. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to the role of palmitate in the regulation of protein targeting to membranes and synaptic sites, palmitoylation is also reversible and dynamically regulated by specific cellular stimuli (26Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 27Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified palmitate turnover on PSD-95 at the synapse (6El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This palmitate cycling occurs in an activity-dependent fashion, and acutely disrupting palmitoylation disperses synaptic clusters of PSD-95. Therefore, we asked whether palmitoylation of synaptotagmin I and SNAP-25, two major elements involved in regulated neurotransmitter release, is dynamic in neuronal cells and whether this process is modulated by synaptic activity. We here demonstrate that palmitoylation is critical for sorting synaptotagmin I to the intracellular vesicular pool at presynaptic contacts. The reduced presynaptic localization of the palmitoylation-deficient mutant correlated with an increase in surface expression of synaptotagmin I and reduced endocytosis, indicating that palmitoylation is required for internalization and sorting to the presynaptic vesicle pool. Pulse-chase experiments using [3H]palmitate in cultured cortical neurons showed that, in contrast with PSD-95 and GAP-43, palmitate turnover was undetectable on synaptotagmin I or SNAP-25 within 6 h of chase with unlabeled palmitate. Significantly, long-term blockade of synaptic activity enhanced the amount of palmitoylated SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin I. In contrast, treatment with botulinum toxin C reduced palmitoylation of synaptotagmin I but not SNAP-25. These findings show that distinct mechanisms regulate addition and removal of palmitate on select neuronal proteins and that this process is regulated by long lasting changes in synaptic activity and association with specific elements of the synaptic vesicle release machinery. Materials and Immunoblotting—Dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, paraformaldehyde, botulinum neurotoxin A, APV, CNQX, and TTX were obtained from Sigma. Botulinum neurotoxin C was obtained from Calbiochem. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was from Amersham Biosciences. Guinea pig anti-GFP antibody was custom-made by Affinity Bioreagent, whereas mouse anti-HA antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse anti-syntaxin monoclonal antibody was described previously (28Honer W.G. Falkai P. Young C. Wang T. Xie J. Bonner J. Hu L. Boulianne G.L. Luo Z. Trimble W.S. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-synaptotagmin I monoclonal (Synaptic System, Gottingen, Germany), anti-SNAP-25 (Sternberger Monoclonals Inc.), anti-GAP-43 (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), anti-PSD-95 (Affinity Bioreagent), and anti-synaptophysin (Sigma). [3H]Palmitic acid was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. For immunoblotting, protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with membranes overnight at 4 °C. Labeled bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA Cloning and Mutagenesis—Construction of synaptotagmin mutants was done by overlap extension PCR. Wild-type and cysteine mutant synaptotagmins I and VII were generated as N-terminal fusions with a GFP or an HA tag and subcloned into XhoI/EcoRI and HindIII/EcoRI of pEGFP-N3 (Invitrogen). N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of synaptotagmin I were generated by PCR and subcloned into XhoI/EcoRI and HindIII/EcoRI of pEGFP-N3. GFP-tagged full-length SNAP-25 and mutants were generated by PCR and subcloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites in-frame with GFP in a pEGFP-N3 construct. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Primary Neuronal Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence— Neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18/19 rats. Cortical and striatal neurons were dissociated by enzyme digestion with papain followed by brief mechanical trituration. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-pretreated 6- or 24-well plates with glass coverslips (12 mm in diameter) and then maintained in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine. For analysis of presynaptic targeting, striatal cultures were used since they represent a more homogeneous population of neurons, composed mainly of medium spiny neurons. For transfection of the various constructs used, striatal cultures were transfected using the Effectine™ lipid-mediated gene transfer kit (QIAGEN Inc.). Coverslips were removed from culture wells and fixed in methanol for 10 min. The cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked in the same buffer with 3% normal goat serum for 1 h. Primary antibodies were added to blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to Cy2 and Cy3 fluorophores (diluted 1:200 in blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then mounted on slides (Frost Plus, Fisher) with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology), and images were taken under a fluorescence microscope with a ×63 objective affixed to a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope. Cell Radiolabeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cortical neurons (4 × 106 cells/well) were labeled for 3 h in neurobasal medium containing 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid (57 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine, cells were incubated for 15 min with methionine-free neurobasal medium and then for 1 h in medium containing 300 μCi/ml Expre35S35S (1175 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For pulse-chase experiments using [3H]palmitate and [35S]methionine, cells were incubated for variable times in conditioned neurobasal medium supplemented with 100-fold excess unlabeled palmitate and methionine. For blocking synaptic activity, cells were treated with 100 μm each CNQX and APV, 100 nm TTX, or 10 mm kynurenate for 3 days before labeling. Labeled cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS. After extracting the proteins for 5 min at 4 °C, Triton X-100 was added to 1% to neutralize the SDS in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, samples were incubated with anti-synaptotagmin I, anti-SNAP-25, anti-PSD-95, and anti-GAP-43 monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. After the addition of 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), samples were incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100; boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 1 mm dithiothreitol for 2 min; and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For autoradiography, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and dried under vacuum. For 35S-labeled samples, gels were exposed overnight to Biomax MS (Eastman Kodak Co.) at -80 °C. For 3H-labeled samples, gels were exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) with intensifying screens at -80 °C for 3–20 days. Quantitative Measurement of Presynaptic Targeting—Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert M200 motorized microscope using a monochrome 14-bit Zeiss Axiocam HR CCD camera at native resolution (1300 × 1030 pixels). The exposure time of the camera was adjusted to limit photobleaching and so that the maximum pixel intensity was approximately one-half to three-fourths saturating for cells with low- to-moderate expression levels (as determined by total pixel counts). 14-bit images were scaled to 16 bits and exported into Northern Eclipse (Empix Imaging, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), where custom-written software routines were applied for image analysis. For analysis of axonal clustering of various transfected constructs, images were taken at individually optimized exposure times adjusted to prevent saturation of pixel values in each color channel. Within one image (field of view), usually one transfected cell was present, and the puncta of the axon of that cell were manually outlined. Cell bodies were not included. To quantify clusters, a binary image (“mask”) was created by using image processing (equalization and thresholding). This mask image was then multiplied with the original image using Boolean arithmetic to yield a discrete number of clusters containing the original pixel values. Quantification of polarized protein expression of wild-type and mutant synaptotagmins I and VII in axons was performed on 10–15 neurons from two to three independent transfections. Four to eight cells from each transfection were analyzed (see “Results” for details of the total number of cells analyzed in each experiment). For each cell, the brightness of axonal clusters was determined by calculating the average pixel intensity in the axon versus axonal puncta. These averages were then converted into a ratio of axonal puncta versus axonal background. Data obtained from independent transfections were pooled and analyzed using the two-tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test to compare changes in protein clusters between experimental groups. For analysis of changes in clustering of endogenous proteins upon treatment with 2-bromopalmitate and glutamate receptor blockers, protein puncta were quantified on at least 15 fields chosen randomly using bright-field from three independent neuronal cultures. After treatment with various drugs, the intensity of the puncta in each field was determined by calculating the average pixel intensity of the puncta at intensities at least twice the background signal. Images acquired from both controls and treated cells were taken at equal exposure times. The values obtained for each treatment were then compared with those obtained for controls performed in parallel at the same time. Data obtained from independent experiments were pooled, and experimental pairs were analyzed to compare changes in protein clusters between experimental groups. Surface Labeling of Synaptotagmin I—Neurons were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde with 4% sucrose at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with antibody that recognizes the N-terminal luminal domain of synaptotagmin I (epitope 604.1, Synaptic Systems) at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Neurons were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies before mounting. Analysis of the intensity of surface expression in axons was determined by calculating the ratio of signal intensity of surface synaptotagmin I in transfected/untransfected cells present in the same field of view. Changes in the amounts of surface synaptotagmin I in 11 cells expressing wild-type and palmitoylation-deficient forms of synaptotagmin I obtained from two independent transfections were then analyzed using the two-tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Endocytosis Assays and Antibody Uptake—PC12 cells were transfected with synaptotagmin I constructs using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). 2 days later, cells were washed on ice with solution containing 120 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 30 mm glucose, and 3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated with primary antibody against the luminal domain of synaptotagmin I for 1 h on ice or at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-HA primary antibody followed by secondary antibodies to visualize total and endocytosed proteins, respectively. Images of HA-stained transfected cells were taken with a Zeiss Meta confocal microscope with a 1.2-numerical aperture water lens with a correction collar (512 × 512 pixel resolution; excitation 1, argon 488 nm at 10%; emission 1, Bandpass Filter 505–530; excitation 2, HeNe 543 nm at 80%; emission 2, Longpass Filter 560). Cells chosen from 5–10 fields of view (HA staining; channel 1) were used for analysis of antibody uptake on channel 2. The intensity of antibody uptake was measured using a line profile across the cell in the middle z-section using Zeiss LSM 5 META Image Examiner. Palmitoylation Regulates Presynaptic Sorting of Synaptotagmin I—Previous studies showed that protein palmitoylation is important for trafficking of several synaptic proteins, including PSD-95, AMPA receptor-binding protein, and GAD-65 (8Craven S.E.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Five Cys residues (Cys-74, Cys-75, Cys-77, Cys-79, and Cys-82) present in the junction between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of synaptotagmin I have been shown to be palmitoylated (18Heindel U. Schmidt M.F. Veit M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here, we asked whether palmitoylation contributes to presynaptic targeting of synaptotagmin I. To assess this, we first constructed HA-tagged wild-type and cysteine mutant forms of synaptotagmin I by replacing the five palmitoylated cysteines with Ser residues. Simultaneous mutation of all cysteine residues (Cys mut1) abolished palmitoylation of synaptotagmin I in heterologous cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, mutation of three cysteines (Cys-77, Cys-79, and Cys-82; Cys mut2) only reduced protein palmitoylation (Fig. 1A), indicating that efficient palmitoylation requires all five cysteines present in this region. To determine whether palmitoylation is involved in presynaptic targeting of synaptotagmin I, we compared the localization of the HA-tagged wild-type and palmitoylation-deficient (Cys mut1) forms of synaptotagmin I in cultured striatal neurons. We found that wild-type synaptotagmin I was targeted to axons with a prominent punctate pattern (Fig. 1B, upper left panel). However, the palmitoylation-deficient mutant (Cys mut1) exhibited mainly a diffuse staining in axons (Fig. 1B, upper right panel). Quantification of the mean ratio of axonal puncta relative to axonal background revealed that the average intensity of the axonal puncta of wild-type synaptotagmin I was 5.38 ± 1.16 (mean ± S.D., n = 14) (Fig. 1C). In comparison, the mean ratio of puncta to background intensity in axons of the cysteine mutant was 2.70 ± 0.64 (mean ± S.D., n = 18) or 50% of the wild-type form. Similar results were obtained using the GFP-tagged wild-type and cysteine mutant forms of synaptotagmin I (Fig. 1B, lower panels) (data not shown). The reduced presynaptic targeting of palmitoylation-deficient synaptotagmin I indicates that palmitoylation contributes to sorting of synaptotagmin I to presynaptic terminals. Consistent with the punctate localization in axons, wild-type synaptotagmin I co-localized with the presynaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin (Fig. 1D). The reduced synaptic targeting of palmitoylation-deficient synaptotagmin I may have resulted either from inefficient sorting to presynaptic vesicles or from enhanced protein degradation due to misfolding and instability of the mutated protein. To differentiate between these possibilities, we utilized pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine to determine whether the half-life of palmitoylation-deficient synaptotagmin I is altered. This analysis revealed no significant difference in the half-life of the wild-type and cysteine mutant forms of synaptotagmin I (Supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that inefficient sorting rather than enhanced degradation may have contributed to the altered trafficking of palmitoylation-deficient synaptotagmin I. We next addressed whether palmitoylation regulates trafficking and presynaptic targeting of SNAP-25. Strikingly, palmitoylation-deficient SNAP-25 showed reduced accumulation in a perinuclear compartment resembling the cis-Golgi (Supplemental Fig. 2). Moreover, wild-type but not cysteine mutant SNAP-25 exhibited punctate pattern in the axons; however, the enrichment of SNAP-25 in the axonal puncta was not significantly different from axonal background, and the contribution of palmitoylation to presynaptic localization of SNAP-25 could not be assessed (Supplemental Fig. 2) (data not shown). Recent studies showed that N-glycosylation is important for sorting synaptotagmin I from the plasma membrane to an intracellular vesicular compartment (29Han W. Rhee J.S. Maximov A. Lao Y. Mashimo T. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2004; 41: 85-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To assess whether palmitoylation plays a role in sorting synaptotagmin I to an intracellular presynaptic compartment, we compared the surface localization of both the wild-type and cysteine mutant forms of synaptotagmin I in non-permeabilized neurons using antibody that recognizes the N-terminal luminal domain of synaptotagmin I (Fig. 2). Consistent with the previous study by Han et al. (29Han W. Rhee J.S. Maximov A. Lao Y. Mashimo T. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2004; 41: 85-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we found that surface expression of synaptotagmin I was modestly enhanced in neurons expressing GFP-tagged wild-type synaptotagmin I (134 ± 6%, mean ± S.D., n = 11). Remarkably, GFP-positive axonal puncta were devoid of surface synaptotagmin I, indicating the sequestration of GFP-tagged synaptotagmin I to an intracellular presynaptic vesicle pool. In contrast, a significant increase in surface expression of synaptotagmin I was observed in neurons expressing the palmitoylation-deficient mutant (181 ± 8%, mean ± S.D., n = 11). The correlation between the increase in surface expression and the lack of accumulation of palmitoylation-deficient synaptotagmin I at presynaptic terminals indicates that palmitoylation is involved in protein internalization and sorting to the presynaptic vesicle pool. To test this possibility, we utilized PC12 cells to assess whether endocytosis of the cysteine mutant is altered. For this analysis, PC12 cells were first transfected with the HA-tagged wild-type and palmitoylation-deficient forms of synaptotagmin I. 2 days post-transfection, cells were incubated for 1 h at 0 or 37 °C with antibody that recognizes the luminal domain of synaptotagmin I. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-HA primary antibody followed by secondary antibodies to visualize total and endocytosed proteins, respectively. Consistent with the previous finding by Han et al. (29Han W. Rhee J.S. Maximov A. Lao Y. Mashimo T. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2004; 41: 85-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), wild-type synaptotagmin I was not detectable on the cell surface at both 0 °C (n = 7) and 37 °C (n = 20), but rather in an intracellular pool that could be observed upon uptake of surface antibodies at 37 °C (Fig. 3). In contrast, efficient surface labeling was observed in cells expressing the palmitoylation-deficient mutant at both 0 °C (n = 10) and 37 °C (n = 22). These results demonstrate that palmitoylation contributes to proper sorting and sequestering of synaptotagmin I from the plasma membrane to an intracellular vesicular pool in PC12 cells and to presynaptic terminals in neurons.

We have previously demonstrated that the loss of expression of BMP receptors (BMPRs) type IA, -IB, and -II (BMP-RIA, -RIB, and -RII) correlates with Gleason score in prostate cancer patients. To evaluate the prognostic value of this observation, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of BMPRs in association with disease progression in 60 patients. The results demonstrated a significant association between the loss of expression of the three BMPRs and Gleason score and clinical stage. However, only the loss of expression of BMP-RII showed a statistically significant association with 5-year survival rate (P<0.05) and biochemical recurrence-free rate following radical prostatectomy (P<0.005). To elucidate the effect of an abnormal BMP signaling in prostate cancer cells, we transfected dominant-negative BMP-RII (BMP-RIIDN) into the human prostate cancer cell line, PC3M. When a stable clone overexpressing BMP-RIIDN was inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice, the tumor growth rate was approximately 10 times that of control and parental cell line. These observations, taken together, indicate that the loss of BMP-RII expression as measured by immunohistochemistry may be a prognostic marker in prostate cancer patients, and that the loss of BMP-RII function may result in increased tumorigenicity in human prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1991501067,"Human centrin 2 (HsCen2) is a member of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins, often associated with the centrosomes and basal bodies. These organelles exhibit different morphological aspects, including a variety of centrin-containing fibers that connect the two centrioles or other structural elements of the pericentriolar space. The molecular basis of the Ca2+-sensitive fibers and their precise role in centrosome duplication are not known. To explore the possible structural role of HsCen2, we initiated a physicochemical study of the self-assembly properties of the purified protein in vitro. Using light scattering experiments, we investigated the temporal evolution of the assembly process and characterized the dependence on various chemical and physical factors, including temperature, di-cation concentration, ionic strength, protein concentration, and pH. The reversible self-assembly revealed many features of a large-size protein polymerization, with nucleation and elongation steps. Kinetic and equilibrium experiments show that a hydrophobic fluorescent probe (ANS) inhibits the polymerization by interfering with the nucleation step, probably through interactions with the apolar exposed sites on the protein surface.

Centrins are small acid proteins (about 170 residues and a molecular mass of 20 kDa) from the highly conserved Ca2+-binding EF-hand superfamily, which were identified in a variety of species from the eukaryote kingdom of protists, fungi, plants, and animals. Spatial and time distribution within the mitotic organizer centers and the critical role of these proteins in cell cycle control have been the subject of intensive investigation in cellular biology for the last decade (1Salisbury J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 2Salisbury J.L. Suino K.M. Busby R. Springett M. Curr.

Kluwer Academic, New York2002: 155-178Google Scholar). Although lower eukaryote organisms (yeast, algae) have generally only one centrin gene, higher vertebrates have four distinct centrin isoforms (5Gavet O. Alvarez C. Gaspar P. Bornens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1818-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with variable sequence and different tissue and cell distribution. HsCen1 1The abbreviations used are: HsCen, human centrin; CaM, calmodulin; ANS, 8-anilino-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; C-HsCen2, the C-terminal domain of HsCen2 (T94-Y172); N-HsCen2, the N-terminal domain of HsCen2 (M1-S98).1The abbreviations used are: HsCen, human centrin; CaM, calmodulin; ANS, 8-anilino-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; C-HsCen2, the C-terminal domain of HsCen2 (T94-Y172); N-HsCen2, the N-terminal domain of HsCen2 (M1-S98). and HsCen2 are highly similar to each other (sequence identity, 81%) and to the algae centrin (68 and 71%, respectively), whereas HsCen3, discovered lately (6Middendorp S. Paoletti A. Schiebel E. Bornens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9141-9146Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), has a more distant sequence; it shows only 58 and 57% identity with HsCen1 and HsCen2, respectively, and is slightly closer to Cdc31, the centrin equivalent in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (59% sequence identity). Mammalian centrin 4 is philogenetically related to HsCen1 and HsCen2 with 72 and 74% sequence identity, respectively, and a restricted expression profile resembling that of HsCen1 (5Gavet O. Alvarez C. Gaspar P. Bornens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1818-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A large part of the sequence diversity among the centrins occurs within the first 20 residues of the amino-terminal domain, which have no counterpart in the “standard” Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM). Historically, centrins were first identified as the major component (63% of the soluble proteins) of the striated flagellar roots from the Prasinophycean green alga Tetraselmis striata (7Salisbury J.L. Baron A. Surek B. Melkonian M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This seems to be a common feature of unicellular green algae where the centrin-containing fibers connect the basal bodies to one another, to the cytoplasm of the cell body, to the plasma membrane, or to the nucleus (8McFadden G.I. Schulze D. Surek B. Salisbury J.L. Melkonian M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It was observed that all of these fibers could contract upon increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (7Salisbury J.L. Baron A. Surek B. Melkonian M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 9Salisbury J.L. Floyd G.L. Science. 1978; 202: 975-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and in some instances this may induce microtubule severing and a consequent excision of the flagellum (7Salisbury J.L. Baron A. Surek B. Melkonian M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The way in which the flagellar roots contract in response to elevated calcium levels suggested that centrin is largely responsible for the motile behavior of the system by forming contractile centrin fibers. Centrin is also one of the major components of the infraciliary lattice spanning the whole cell surface in Paramecium (10Beisson J. Clérot J.-C. Fleury-Aubusson A. Garreau de Loubresse N. Ruiz F. Klotz C. Protist. 2001; 152: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of other polypeptide components, the sensitivity to Ca2+ and EGTA of this cytoskeletal network suggests a central regulating and structural role for the centrin component. Similar structural and motility roles for centrin were also suggested in higher eukaryotic cells. Thus, in cultures of PtK2 epithelial cells, it was observed that at high Ca2+ concentrations, centrin can form detectable large spots near the cell center or pericentriolar well-formed satellites (11Baron A.T. Suman V.J. Nemeth E. Salisbury J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2993-3003PubMed Google Scholar). The authors proposed that the pericentriolar satellites and the centrosomal matrix may be interconvertable forms of the same fibrillar material, essentially composed of centrin. HsCen1 and/or HsCen2 were also suggested to be involved in ciliary beating of human nasal epithelial cells in culture (12Laoukili J. Perret E. Middendorp S. Houcine O. Guennou C. Marano F. Bornens M. Tournier F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 1355-1364Google Scholar). Within the complex structure of the centrosomes, centrins evolve among many other proteins (about 100 in the pericentriolar material) of larger size, exposing significant hydrophobic surface areas (13Wigge P.A. Jensen O.N. Holmes S. Souès S. Mann M. Kilmartin J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 141: 967-977Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The intermolecular interaction of these components may explain the high density and viscous character of the pericentriolar environment. In an earlier comparative study focused on the physicochemical diversity of centrins, Wiech et al. (14Wiech H. Geier B.M. Paschke T. Spang A. Grein K. Steinkötter J. Melkonian M. Schiebel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22453-22461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showed that centrins from yeast (Cdc31p), algae (Scherffelia dubia centrin (SdCen)), or humans (HsCen1, HsCen2) may form multimers in the presence of Ca2+, in clear contrast with the yeast calmodulin. Among the proteins studied, the algal centrin exhibits a considerably higher propensity to associate into high-density material that can be sedimented by low-speed centrifugation. These results raise at least three important questions related to 1) the biological significance of the observations, 2) the molecular mechanism of the self-association, and 3) the relevance of the weaker interactions observed with the human isoforms. The aim of the present work is mainly related to the last two points, focusing on the physicochemical and molecular basis of HsCen2 self-assembly. To address these objectives, we used the high-purity recombinant protein and various constructs, derived from its sequence, overexpressed in Escherichia coli. On the basis of spectroscopic and thermodynamic observations (light scattering, fluorescence, and calorimetry), we characterized the self-assembly of purified HsCen2 and its dependence on various physicochemical parameters (temperature, pH, Ca2+, ionic strength, and protein concentration). Experiments using isolated domains or a truncated form of the protein lacking the first 25 residues suggest that interactions between N- and C-terminal domains from different subunits play a crucial role in the observed process. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant proteins or domains (HsCen2 and C-HsCen2) were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (15Durussel I. Blouquit Y. Middendorp S. Craescu C.T. Cox J.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Matei E. Miron S. Blouquit Y. Duchambon P. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Craescu C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cDNA of the domain N-HsCen2 (residues 1–98) and of the construct Δ25HsCen2 (which lacks the first 25 residues) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction from the cDNA of HsCen2 and subcloned into the expression vector pET Blue-1 (Novagen). The vector was transferred into E. coli Tuner (DE3) pLacI, which were incubated at 37 °C. At an optical density of 1.0 (at 600 nm), protein synthesis was induced using isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 2 h. After purification, the proteins were lyophilized and kept at –80 °C. The stock protein solutions in the appropriate buffer were conserved in liquid nitrogen and thawed before the experiments. The usual buffer was 50 mm Bis-Tris, 20 mm KCl, pH 7.1 (buffer A), which may contain various concentrations of divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+). Light Scattering Measurements—Solution turbidity changes induced by rapid temperature increase were monitored by the absorbance at various wavelengths (>300 nm) of the protein samples in quartz cells of 1-mm or 1-cm optical path. By analogy with the extinction coefficient, the turbidity parameter (τ) of a solution of concentration c in a l-cm cell is defined by the reduction in intensity of an incident light of intensity I0.It=I0exp(−τ×c×l) For particles much smaller than the wavelength, this parameter may be simply related to the Rayleigh ratio at 90° (17Campbell I.D. Dwek R.A. Biological spectroscopy. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., Menlo Park1984Google Scholar).τ=(16π/3)×(8π4α2)/λ4=(16π/3)×R90 A spectrophotometer Hitachi U-2001, equipped with an external temperature control unit (Lauda RM6), was used for turbidimetry experiments. In the absence of specific absorption, the optical density, at a given wavelength, of a macromolecular solution allows estimation of the elastic light diffusion that in turn is related to the average tri-dimensional size of the species present in solution. Some of the light scattering observations at 90° were also performed with a fluorescence spectrometer (Jasco FP777), using the same excitation and emission wavelengths. ANS Binding—ANS (ammonium salt) was purchased from Sigma. Fluorescence emission of the fluorescent hydrophobic probe was recorded at a constant excitation (375 nm) in a 1-cm path length cuvette. The time dependence of the emission fluorescence was recorded on a Jasco FP777 fluorimeter, equipped with a temperature control device. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Thermodynamic parameters of intermolecular interactions at constant temperature were investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry using a MicroCal MCS instrument (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). The samples were equilibrated in the same buffer and degassed before their use. In a standard experiment, one sample (usually 250 μm) in a 250-μl syringe is diluted into the 1.337-ml calorimeter cell using 20–30 automatic injections of 8–15 μl each. The reaction triggered by each injection generally produces heat absorption or heat emission, recorded as positive or negative peaks, respectively, on a thermogram. Integration of the peaks corresponding to each injection and correction for the baseline, performed using Origin-based software, give the enthalpy variation along the mixing path, which represents the reaction isotherm. Fitting of the data to various interaction models results in the stoichiometry (n), equilibrium binding constant (Ka), and enthalpy of the interaction (ΔH). The Thermal-induced HsCen2 Self-assembly Is Reversible— When a solution of HsCen2, buffered at physiological pH, is transferred from ice to a higher temperature in the spectrophotometer, the turbidity changes according to a reproducible pattern including a delay time, a fast increasing phase, and a final plateau. The kinetic and the equilibrium parameters depend on the final temperature (Fig. 1). Generally, this pattern is associated with a reversible, nucleation-controlled polymerization starting with the nucleation process (the delay time), during which several monomers associate to form nuclei or seeds serving as initiators of the polymer formation. The slope of the elongation step is associated with the rate of polymer elongation, whereas the final plateau is determined by the size of the scattering objects. In cases where this size is much lower than the incident light wavelength, the turbidity is proportional to 1/λ4. In our experiments, we used relatively low KCl concentrations in the buffer (usually 20 mm) to keep the working temperature range under the physiological values. The three phases are better distinguished at lower temperatures (Fig. 1A). In all of our experiments, the observed process is reversible and highly reproducible. When the temperature is switched back to 0 °C, the sample is again optically transparent, and repetitive experiments with the same sample give superimposable curves. At higher temperatures, the lag phase decreases considerably, and the larger final amplitude imposes use of 1-mm cells (Fig. 1B). Because of a relatively slow temperature equilibration of the sample, estimation of the initial lag phase or of the elongation rate is less reliable, and only the equilibrium final turbidity could be confidently considered. We noted that this last parameter increases with temperature and reaches a plateau between 30° and 40 °C. The back extrapolation of the temperature dependence curve permits a rough estimation of the minimal self-assembly temperature (Tmin) in given experimental conditions (Fig. 1B, inset). The order of the final temperature in a series of experiments using the same sample does not influence the pattern of the curve or the extrapolated Tmin value. The general properties of the temperature-induced self-assembly of HsCen2, observed in these experiments, are similar to those of the polymerization process observed for other biomolecules, such as hemoglobin S (18Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), actin (19Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Self-assembly Is a Heterogeneous and Multi-step Process—A series of light scattering experiments were conducted at different wavelengths, between 330 and 800 nm. The equilibrium final intensity of the scattered light increases continuously with the decreasing wavelength of observation, but the curves show a similar global trend (Fig. 2). A more detailed analysis revealed several specific characteristics of the self-association process, which may be related to the size of the assemblies, the heterogeneity, and the interconversion rate between the different components. The expected 1/λ4 dependence of the light scattering is not fulfilled, indicating the presence of large particles, with sizes comparable to the observation wavelength (hundreds of nm). Small but reproducible differences may be observed among the patterns of various curves. Thus, at 330 nm the rate of polymer elongation is higher than at other wavelengths, and the initial lag phase is not detectable. In addition, the final plateau exhibits a continuous slow decrease, in contrast with the increasing tendency observed at 800 nm. An intermediate behavior was noted between these two wavelengths. Taken together, the above observations suggest that the fast self-assembly phase produces scattering species of heterogeneous size distribution, which may rearrange slowly in a subsequent phase. In the simplest case, we can assume the presence of two main classes of turbid objects, with smaller (≪λ) and larger (∼λ) sizes. The observed pattern at 330 nm, where the scattering is more sensitive to the smaller size population (1/λ4 dependence), suggests that formation of the smaller particles has faster kinetics (Fig. 2). The decreasing tendency of the plateau may be explained by a slow conversion of these species into larger objects. On the other hand, at 800 nm where the scattering is less sensitive to smaller sizes, the plateau shows a positive slope, in agreement with the hypothesis of a progressive increase in particle average size. Ca2+Dependence—In the absence of Ca2+, it was not possible to detect any increase in the light scattering at temperatures up to 40 °C, protein concentrations up to 170 μm, and a Mg2+/protein ratio up to 12. A systematic search for di-cation dependence of HsCen2 self-assembly revealed that a minimum of one Ca2+ ion per protein and an excess of divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+) are necessary to trigger the molecular association process. We have demonstrated recently that HsCen2 has only a strong binding site for Ca2+, which discriminates against Mg2+ ions (15Durussel I. Blouquit Y. Middendorp S. Craescu C.T. Cox J.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because Mg2+ alone is not able to initiate the self-assembly, we conclude that highly scattering species can form only with the holo form of the protein. Fig. 3A shows that the maximum turbidity increases with the divalent cation concentration and shows a plateau at high concentrations. Mn2+ and Ca2+ appear to be more efficient than Mg2+ in inducing the self-association, as reflected in the tighter cation dependence of DOmax. These experiments demonstrate that HsCen2 self-assembly requires one Ca2+ ion, specifically bound to the C-terminal domain, and a moderate molar excess of Ca2+ or other divalent cations. Tight binding of the first Ca2+ ion stabilizes an open conformation of the C-terminal half, with the exposure of a large hydrophobic surface that may constitute a strong interaction site with other molecules (16Matei E.

Craescu C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40252-40261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Additional divalent cations, required for the self-assembly, may bind to the low-affinity Ca2+-binding motifs. Indeed, EF-hand III exhibits a binding constant on the order of 104m–1 (16Matei E. Miron S. Blouquit Y. Duchambon P. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Craescu C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal motifs have an even lower affinity (on the order of 102m–1). 2A. Yang and C. T. Craescu, unpublished results. It may be noted that G-actin polymerization is also modulated by divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+), but in this case, Mg2+ is more efficient in decreasing the lag phase and increasing the elongation rate (26Steinmetz M.O. Goldie K.N. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similarly to HsCen2, G-actin exhibits two classes of metal-binding sites, a strong one (∼109m–1), in which the metal is linked to ATP, and several weaker binding sites (∼105 to 104m–1) (27Carlier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dependence on Protein Concentration—Increasing the protein concentration, while keeping constant the other physicochemical parameters (buffer A, 1.2 mm Ca2+ at 38 °C), results in a faster self-assembly process and a higher plateau (Fig. 3B). In these conditions, a concentration of 50 μm (1 mg/ml) appeared as the minimum requirement for the experimental observations and was mainly used throughout this work. Other Physicochemical Factors (pH, Ionic Strength)—A clear pH dependence, in the range of common physiological values, was pointed out by our experiments. The acid pH favors centrin polymerization, whereas basic pH is an unfavorable factor. For instance, a solution of 250 μm HsCen2 in buffer A, 2 mm CaCl2 shows a Tmin of 13 °C, 20 °C, and 24 °C at pH 6.5, 7.1, and 7.6, respectively. Similar to many members of the CaM superfamily, human centrins are acidic proteins, with a pI around 4.8. However, HsCen1 and HsCen2 exhibit a common distinctive feature consisting of an asymmetric charge distribution among the two EF-hand domains; although the C-terminal half has an acidic character, the N-terminal half is distinctly basic (pI, 7.9), essentially because of the Arg and Lys content of the first 25-residue segment. Therefore, this last domain is much more sensitive to the proton concentration in the working pH domain, becoming less positive from pH 6 to pH 8. One may conclude that the positive charge of the N-terminal EF-hand is favorable to the self-assembly, probably by interacting with negative charges of the C-terminal domain of another subunit. In contrast to the divalent cations, higher (>50 μm) monovalent salt concentrations (Na/K) have the tendency to inhibit centrin polymerization. The monovalent ion inhibitory effect should be related to a possible reduction in Ca2+ affinity (as it was demonstrated for CaM (28Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and/or to a screening of electrostatic attractive interactions that contribute to the self-assembly. A different behavior was noted for actin polymerization (29Cooper J.A. Pollard T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 182-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Greer S.C. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2002; 53: 173-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), for which the minimal temperature of polymerization is lower at higher salt concentration (KCl). ANS Binding—ANS is a hydrophobic fluorescence probe generally used to detect exposed apolar surfaces in protein structures (31Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Interaction of the probe with a hydrophobic site results in an increased fluorescence intensity, usually accompanied by a blue-shift of the maximum. We showed recently that binding of a similar molecular probe (2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate) to the C-terminal domain of HsCen2 is considerably increased upon Ca2+ binding, suggesting that the main binding site is situated in the hydrophobic pocket, which is also the target interaction site (16Matei E. Miron S. Blouquit Y. Duchambon P. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Craescu C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, use of a slightly longer C-terminal construct, in which an intra-protein interaction blocks the main hydrophobic pocket, showed a dramatic decrease in 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate binding. To investigate the role of the Ca2+-induced hydrophobic surface in the centrin self-association process, we assessed whether binding of a fluorescent probe interferes with the protein/protein interaction. As showed in Fig. 4A, increasing concentrations of ANS result in a lower final intensity of the scattered light (the height of the plateau), whereas the kinetics characteristics (nucleation and elongation steps) seem to be less affected. In addition, experiments conducted at different temperatures showed that the minimum polymerization temperature increases linearly with the fluorescent probe concentration up to 800 μm (Fig. 4B). The inhibitory effect of the hydrophobic probes strongly suggests that the primary binding sites of ANS are identical or close to the intermolecular interaction sites inducing polymer elongation. In contrast with the temperature-dependent curves (Fig. 1), where the decrease in plateau is coupled to a slower nucleation (producing more nuclei) and elongation phases, the ANS effect concerns only the final light scattering intensity, most probably attributable to a reduced number of active molecules. The ANS inhibition effect was further explored using the fluorescence spectroscopy. In buffer A containing 2 mm Ca2+, the fluorescence emission of the probe has a maximum at 520 nm and a low quantum yield. When HsCen2 (50 μm) is added, ANS shows a 9-fold enhancement of the fluorescence emission and a blue-shifted maximum at 466 nm, reflecting its binding to a hydrophobic protein region. The light scattering at 450 nm (λex, 450 nm) as well as the fluorescence emission (λex, 375 nm; λem, 466 nm,) of the mixture HsCen2/ANS (50 μm/250 μm) was monitored as functions of time, at different temperatures. Signal recording started immediately after the sample transfer from ice to the thermostated cell holder of the spectrofluorimeter. As may be seen in Fig. 5, the self-association process, revealed by the light scattering measurement (Fig. 5B), is accompanied by a considerable decrease in ANS fluorescence emission (Fig. 5A) and a slight red-shift of the λmax (Fig. 5D). Control experiments showed that the same thermal variations induced only a modest (∼5%) increase of the fluorescence emission of ANS alone, as was also observed for the ANS dimeric conjugate (bis-ANS) (32Tang D. Borchman D. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In light of the previous results presented here, the decrease in ANS fluorescence, after the temperature switch, may be explained by a release of protein-bound fluorescent probes into the more polar buffer environment. An additional contribution may come from the thermal inactivation of the probe excited state, but we expect it to be much smaller. For instance, only a moderate fluorescence decrease (8%) for bis-ANS bound to α-crystallin, observed between 20 °C and 38 °C, was related to this mechanism (33Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Also, as will be shown later, ANS fluorescence is not affected by the temperature in a system containing a non-assembling HsCen2 variant. The temperature profiles of the two ob"

Binding of p14 Arf to WRN is multivalent and resembles the binding of p14 Arf to Mdm2. Residues 2–14 and 82–101 of p14 Arf and residues in the central region and C terminus of WRN have particular importance for binding. p14 Arf promotes small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification of WRN in a synergistic manner with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, UBCH9. p14 Arf causes redistribution of WRN within the nucleus, and this effect is reversed by expression of a SUMO-specific protease, thus implicating the SUMO conjugation pathway in WRN re-localization. We establish that the ability to promote SUMO conjugation is a general property of the p14 Arf tumor suppressor."

(S)-2,3-Di-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase, which catalyzes the transfer of a geranylgeranyl group from geranylgeranyl diphosphate to (S)-3-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate, is involved in the biosynthesis of archaeal membrane lipids. Enzymes of the UbiA prenyltransferase family are known to catalyze the transfer of a prenyl group to various acceptors with hydrophobic ring structures in the biosynthesis of respiratory quinones, hemes, chlorophylls, vitamin E, and shikonin.

We propose here that archaeal prenyltransferases involved in membrane lipid biosynthesis might be prototypes of the protein family and that archaea might have played an important role in the molecular evolution of prenyltransferases. The structures of membrane lipids have some interesting and remarkable properties that enable us to distinguish archaea from other organisms, i.e. eukaryotes and bacteria (1De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1988; 27: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Although the archaeal “diether” membrane lipids are homologues of glycerolipids in other organisms, they differ with respect to the following features: 1) The hydrocarbon moieties of the archaeal lipids are fully reduced C20 or C25 prenyl groups, whereas the ordinary glycerolipids contain linear acyl groups. 2) The alkyl groups are attached to glycerol via an ether bond in archaeal lipids, while glycerol and the acyl chains are ester-bonded in the bacterial and eukaryotic glycerolipids. 3) The two groups of membrane lipids have opposite chiralities at their glycerol moieties; in short, the glycerol moieties of the archaeal and other glycerolipids are sn-2,3-di-O-alkylated and sn-1,2-di-O-acylated, respectively. Moreover, the existence of circular “tetraether” lipids, which are synthesized from two molecules of diether lipids in methanogenic and thermophilic archaea, emphasizes the uniqueness of the archaeal membrane lipids. The biosynthesis of the core structure of archaeal membrane lipids has been studied to date (Fig. 2).

Suzuki M. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14792-14797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Archaeoglobus fulgidus (3Wang C.W. Oh M.K. Liao J.C. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 62: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and a methanogenic archeaon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (4Chen A. Poulter C.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and homologues have been identified in the genomes of various archaea. It is also noteworthy that some archaea such as halophilic Natronobacterium pharaonis (5Tachibana A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and thermophilic Aeropyrum pernix (6Tachibana A. Yano Y. Otani S. Nomura N. Sako Y. Taniguchi M. Eur. J.

Soc. 1993; 115: 1270-1277Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showed that the formation of ether linkages between G-1-P and two molecules of GGPP in M. thermoautotrophicum are catalyzed by distinct prenyltransferases. The first step, yielding (S)-3-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate (GGGP), is catalyzed by GGGP synthase (GGGPS). This enzyme was characterized in detail by Zhang et al. (12Chen A. Zhang D. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21701-21705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the GGGPS genes were recently independently cloned from M. thermoautotrophicum (13Soderberg T. Chen A. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14847-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Thermoplasma acidophilum (14Nemoto N. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The second step that involves the production of (S)-2,3-di-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate (DGGGP) from GGGP and GGPP is catalyzed by a microsomal enzyme, DGGGP synthase (DGGGPS), although further information concerning this prenyltransferase has not been obtained at this time. DGGGP, which has been shown to be the intermediate of archaeal membrane lipids, as evidenced by an incorporation experiment by Eguchi et al. (15Eguchi T. Nishimura Y. Kakinuma K. Tetrahedron Lett. 2003; 44: 3275-3279Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), would be expected to subsequently undergo saturation of the alkyl group, modification of the polar head group, and the formation of the cyclic tetraether structure (16Kon T. Nemoto N. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, comprehensive information concerning these biosynthetic reactions is not available: the genes and proteins involved and even the order of the reactions are unknown at this time, expect for some enzymes that catalyze the modification of polar head groups (17Morii H. Koga Y. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Morii H. Nishihara M. Koga Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36568-36574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a gene encoding a homologue of ubiquinone-biosynthetic prenyltransferase from the whole genome sequence of a thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus as the candidate of the DGGGPS gene. The gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinantly expressed enzyme was shown to specifically catalyze the formation of DGGGP from GGGP and GGPP. The fact that the predicted orthologues of this enzyme are encoded in the genomes of almost all archaea whose entire genome sequences have been determined strongly suggests their involvement in the biosynthesis of archaeal membrane lipids. Based on a sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, DGGGPS appeared to be a member of a large family of proteins, i.e. the UbiA prenyltransferase family, which consists of prenyltransferases that are involved in the biosyntheses of respiratory quinones, hemes, chlorophylls, vitamin E, and shikonin. Materials—Precoated reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography plates, LKC-18F were purchased from Whatman Chemical Separation, Inc. GGPP and (all-E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) were donated by Drs. Kyozo Ogura and Tanetoshi Koyama, Tohoku University. [1-14C]Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and [1-3H]GGPP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Isolation of Archaeal Prenyltransferase Genes—The ubiA-2 gene was amplified by means of a PCR by using primers specific to the 5′- and 3′-ends; 5′-ACGTTCATATGAGTTTAAAATCCTATATG-3′ and 5′-TAGATAGGATCCTTAGCCTTTAAAGAATGGAAG-3′, respectively. The genome of S. solfataricus, as a template, and KOD DNA polymerase (TOYOBO) were used in the reaction. The new restriction sites introduced into the primers, the NdeI and BamHI sites, are indicated with underlines. The amplified fragment, extracted from 0.8% agarose gel after electrophoresis, was digested with NdeI and BamHI and then ligated into the NdeI-BamHI sites of the pET-15b vector (Amersham Biosciences). The resultant plasmid was designated as pET-HisUbiA2. The S. solfataricus orthologue of GGGPS gene was also amplified with the PCR primers, 5′-AGAGGACATATGCGTATACTGAAGAAGAAAATG-3′ and 5′-CCTTTCGGATCCTTATTTATTCTTTATTCCCC-3′, and the DNA fragment, after digestion with NdeI and BamHI, was ligated into the pET-15b vector to construct pET-HisGGGPS. The S. acidocaldarius gds gene, encoding GGPS, was amplified with the primers, 5′-AGTACTTTGACTCATATGAGTTACTTTGACAACTATTTTA-3′ and 5′-TGCAGAGGATCCTTATTTTCTCCTTCTTATCGTAAAT-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET-15b to construct pET-HisGGPS. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant Enzymes—E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with each of the plasmids, as described above, was cultivated in 1 liter of M9YG broth supplemented with ampicillin (50 mg/liter). When the A600 of the culture reached 0.5, the transformed bacteria were induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside. After an additional 5-h cultivation, the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in HisTrap (Amersham Biosciences) binding buffer, containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (100 mm for the purification of UbiA-2), prepared following the manufacturer's instructions. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was recovered as a crude extract. The crude extract was heated at 55 °C for 1 h, and the denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 20 min. Note that in the case of the purification of UbiA-2 protein, CHAPS at a final concentration of 0.2% was added to the crude extract to solubilize the recombinant protein before the heat treatment. The supernatant fraction was loaded on a HisTrap column, which had been equilibrated with the HisTrap binding buffer. The column was washed with the binding buffer, and proteins that had specifically bound were then eluted with a HisTrap elution buffer, containing 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, and 350 mm imidazole, and used for characterization. The level of purification was determined by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Radio-assays for Prenyltransferase Reactions—The assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 200 μl, 0.5 nmol of [1-14C]IPP (2.04 GBq/mmol), 0.5 nmol of (all-E)FPP, 0.2 μg of α-glycerophosphate (α-GP), 2 μmol of MgCl2, 10 μmol of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, and suitable amounts of enzymes, i.e. GGPS, GGGPS, and/or UbiA-2. These mixtures were incubated at 55 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of a cold, saturated solution of NaCl. The mixture was shaken with 600 μl of 1-butanol saturated with H2O. The hydrophobic products extracted with 1-butanol were treated with acid phosphatase according to the method of Fujii et al. (19Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) The hydrolysates were extracted with pentane and analyzed by reversed-phase TLC using a precoated plate, LKC-18F, developed with acetone/H2O (9/1). Authentic standard geranylgeraniol was visualized by exposure of the plate to iodine vapor, and the distribution of radioactivity was detected using a molecular imager (Bio-Rad). Enzymatic Preparation of GGGP—To synthesize radiolabeled GGGP, the same reaction mixture as was used in the radio-assay was employed, although UbiA-2 was removed. Non-labeled GGGP was produced with only GGGPS, replacing [14C]IPP and FPP by GGPP. The butanol-extracted compounds were concentrated and loaded onto a YMC-Pack ODS-A column (4.6 × 250 mm, YMC) connected to a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. They were eluted with eluant A (25 mm NH4HCO3) isocratically for the first 5 min and then with a linear gradient from 100% eluant A to 100% eluant B (acetonitrile) through 30 min, and finally with eluant B for 25 min, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, under the method of Zhang and Poulter (20Zhang D. Poulter C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The eluted products were detected by UV absorption at 210 nm or by radioactivity measured with a ramona Star radio-HPLC analyzer (Raytest). GGGP was eluted at about 34 min, whereas GGPP emerged at about 30 min. A fast atom bombardmentmass spectrometry (FAB-MS) analysis of non-labeled GGGP was performed with an MStation JMS-700 mass spectrometry system (JEOL) in the negative ion mode, using diethanolamine as the matrix. Analysis of the Product of Prenyltransferase Reaction Catalyzed by UbiA-2—The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 400 μl, 120 nmol of GGPP, 800 nmol of α-GP, 4 μmol of MgCl2, 20 μmol of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, and suitable amounts of GGGPS and UbiA-2. This mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 1 h, and hydrophobic compounds were extracted with 1.2 ml of 1-butanol. The butanol layer was concentrated and loaded on a COSMOSIL 5C4-AR-300 column (4.6 × 150 mm, Nacalai Tesque). The compounds were eluted from the column with the same eluant profile as was used in the HPLC analysis of GGGP formation described above. Elution of the compounds was detected by UV absorption at 210 nm. In addition to the absorption peak of GGGP, which eluted at about 27 min, a peak eluting at about 35 min was observed. An FAB-MS analysis of the product that co-eluted with the peak was performed with an MStation JMS-700 mass spectrometry system (JEOL) in the negative ion mode, using diethanol amine as the matrix. In addition, the product was treated with acid phosphatase by a method described by Fujii et al. (19Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), extracted with pentane, and analyzed by FAB-MS in the positive ion-mode. A double-labeling experiment was conducted using an assay mixture containing, in a final volume of 200 μl, 1 nmol of [14C] GGGP, 1 nmol of [3H]GGPP, 2 μmol of MgCl2, 10 μmol of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, and a suitable amount of UbiA-2. The reaction product was hydrolyzed with acid phosphatase and analyzed by HPLC, using a YMC-Pack ODS-A column (4.6 × 250 mm, YMC) eluted with methanol/2-propanol (7:3). The proportion of 3H and 14C radioactivities that co-eluted with the peak of the new product was measured using a ramona Star radio-HPLC analyzer (Raytest). The specificity of UbiA-2 for prenyl donor substrates was examined by replacing [3H]GGPP with 60 nmol of GGPP, (all-E)FPP, or phytyl diphosphate in the reaction mixture for the double-labeling experiment. To investigate the specificity for prenyl acceptor substrates, [14C]GGGP was replaced with α-GP, 4-hydroxybenzoate, 1,4-dihydroxy 2-naphthoate, or homogentisate. The formation of reaction products was confirmed by HPLC using the same method as described above. Phylogenetic Analysis—Amino acid sequences of some typical enzymes classified as members of the “UbiA prenyltransferase family” according to the Pfam protein family data base (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/) were obtained from other public protein databases. They were aligned using the ClustalW 1.8 program on the DDBJ web site (spiral.genes.nig.ac.jp/homology/welcome-e.shtml), and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with the neighbor-joining method. All parameters used in the program were at the default settings. Isolation of a Novel, Hypothetical Prenyltransferase Gene of S. solfataricus—We noted that, in the entire genome sequence of S. solfataricus, there are two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding homologues of UbiA, a well known prenyltransferase for ubiquinone biosynthesis. The ORFs, SSO0125 and SSO0583, are designated as ubiA-1 and ubiA-2, respectively. Because S. solfataricus is known to produce caldariellaquinone, not ubiquinone, as an electron carrier compound in its respiratory chain, one of the two ORFs is thought to encode the enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the respiratory quinone. The UbiA-1 protein from S. solfataricus has a higher similarity (25.9% identity) with E. coli UbiA octaprenyl diphosphate:4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase than S. solfataricus UbiA-2 (20.1% identity). Indeed, the result of an orthologue analysis using the www server of the Microbial Genome Data Base (mbgd.genome.ad.jp/) indicated that UbiA-1 is an orthologue of E. coli UbiA, suggesting that the enzyme is likely the prenyltransferase involved in caldariellaquinone biosynthesis. On the other hand, UbiA-2 was treated in the data base as an orthologue of cyanobacterial chlorophyll a synthase ChlG, which is also homologous with UbiA prenyltransferase and catalyzes the transfer of a phytyl group to chlorophyllide a. Moreover, almost all archaea whose entire genome sequences have been determined, except for Nanoarchaeum equitans, appeared to possess the predicted orthologues of UbiA-2. Because it is generally thought that archaea do not require either chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophyll, we initially thought that UbiA-2 might be involved in the biosynthesis of prenylated hemes, which have the porphyrin structure of chlorophyll. However, we immediately noted that the genome of S. solfataricus also encodes a probable orthologue of ferrous protoheme IX farnesyltransferase, in SSO0656, another ORF homologous to ubiA. These facts strongly suggest that UbiA-2 and its predicted orthologues encoded in the archaeal genomes have an unrevealed, but very important function in archaeal cells. The archaeal lipid-biosynthetic reaction in which a geranylgeranyl group is transformed to GGGP, an acyclic prenyl-acceptor, to produce DGGGP was a promising candidate for the function, although the other reactions catalyzed by the homologues of UbiA studied thus far typically require acceptors that contain aromatic or porphyrin structures. It should be noted here that the symbiotic archaeon Nanoarchaeum equitans is known to lack lipogenic genes in its genome (21Waters E. Hohn M.J. Ahel I. Graham D.E. Adams M.D. Barnstead M. Beeson K.Y. Bibbs L. Bolanos R. Keller M. Kretz K. Lin X. Mathur E. Ni J. Podar M. Richardson T. Sutton G.G. Simon M. Söll D. Stetter K.O. Short J.M. Noordewier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12984-12988Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), so it seems reasonable that it should have no DGGGPS gene. Thus, we decided to isolate the ORF SSO0583, encoding a protein of 282 amino acids, to characterize its function. The ORF was amplified by PCR from the genome of S. solfataricus, and the amplified DNA fragment was digested with restriction enzymes and inserted into pET15b, an expression vector for E. coli. Expression and Purification of Recombinant S. solfataricus UbiA-2—The recombinant UbiA-2 protein with a hexameric histidine tag at its N terminus was expressed in the cells of E. coli. After heat treatment of a crude extract from E. coli cells, the recombinant protein was precipitated without any loss of activity, probably because it is associated with the membrane of the host. However, by adding 0.2% CHAPS to the crude extract, we succeeded in solubilizing the enzyme, which enabled us to purify the enzyme by removing proteins from the host by means of a heat treatment at 55 °C for 1 h. We then used metal chelating affinity column chromatography for further purification of the UbiA-2 protein. As shown in Fig. 3, a major protein band was observed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Although the molecular mass of histidine-tagged UbiA-2, estimated from the SDS-PAGE analysis to be ∼28 kDa, was slightly smaller than that calculated from its amino acid sequence, this situation might arise from the high thermostability of the enzyme and/or the fact that the enzyme is membrane intrinsic. Enzymatic Synthesis of GGGP—To synthesize substrates for the DGGGPS reaction, two prenyltransferases that catalyze former reactions, i.e. GGPS and GGGPS, were prepared. The S. acidocaldarius GGPS gene gds, which we had cloned previously (2Ohnuma S.-i. Suzuki M. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14792-14797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the S. solfataricus putative GGGPS gene SSO0259, which was assigned based on its high homology with known GGGPSs and amplified by PCR, were inserted into an expression vector pET15b, respectively. Both prenyltransferases were efficiently expressed as histidine-tagged proteins in E. coli cells and were purified from the crude extracts by a heat treatment and metal affinity chromatography. We were able to produce radiolabeled GGPP from [14C]IPP and FPP, which could be confirmed by the TLC analysis of the product extracted with 1-butanol, after hydrolysis with acid phosphatase (Fig. 4A, lane 1). By adding purified GGGPS to the reaction mixture for GGPS, a new radiolabeled spot was detected by TLC analysis using the same procedure (Fig. 4A, lane 2). These reaction mixtures contained α-GP, a mixture of G-1-P and sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P), as the prenyl acceptor substrate for GGGPS, because G-1-P, which is the substrate for GGGPSs from M. thermoautotrophicum and T. acidophilum, was not commercially available. However, the actual substrate for the predicted GGGPS is considered to be G-1-P as well, because the reaction did not proceed when commercial G-3-P was used (data not shown). The peak of a new product was found, in addition to the GGPP peak, in the reversed-phase HPLC analysis of hydrophobic compounds extracted from the incubated reaction mixture containing GGPS, GGGPS, and non-labeled substrates. The new product was confirmed to be GGGP by negative-mode FAB-MS: an ion peak with an m/z value of 443, which corresponds to [M-H]- of GGGP, was found. The enzymatically synthesized GGGPS, which could be produced in either non-labeled or radiolabeled forms, was used for the characterization of UbiA-2. Function of UbiA-2 Protein—By the addition of the UbiA-2 protein to the reaction mixture for GGGPS, which contains GGGP and GGPP, the generation of a new radiolabeled spot was observed by the TLC analysis of the phosphatase-treated products (Fig. 4A, lane 3). The new spot disappeared, and only the spot of geranylgeraniol was observed, when GGGPS was removed from the mixture (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Using the purified UbiA-2 protein and the substrates, GGPP and the enzymatically synthesized GGGP, we attempted to examine the activity of UbiA-2 as DGGGPS. By a HPLC analysis using a C4 reversed-phase column, a new product was found. This product eluted from the column later than GGGP and was formed after incubation (Fig. 4B). The product was shown to give an ion peak with an m/z value of 716, which corresponds to [M-H]- of DGGGP, by negative FAB-MS (Fig. 4C). By the acid-phosphatase treatment of the product, we were able to obtain a pentane-extractable compound whose m/z value, as determined by positive FAB-MS analysis, was 637, which corresponds to the alcohol produced by the hydrolytic removal of a phosphate group from DGGGP (Fig. 4D). Moreover, a double labeling experiment using [3H]GGPP and [14C]GGGP indicated that the ratio of these substrates used to form the product from the reaction of UbiA-2 was 1:1.10 ± 0.27. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that the product is DGGGP. When GGPP was substituted with other prenyl donors, i.e. FPP and phytyl diphosphate, the formation of new products, which could have been synthesized by the prenyl transfer reaction with [14C]GGGP, was not found. On the other hand, 4-hydroxybenzoate, 1,4-dihydroxy 2-naphthoate, homogentisate, and α-GP did not function as prenyl acceptor substrates, at least when [3H]GGPP was used as the prenyl donor. These results clearly indicate that the reaction catalyzed by UbiA-2 is highly specific and that the archaeal enzyme is DGGGPS. The enzyme activity of DGGGPS disappeared when 10 mm Mg2+ was replaced with an equivalent concentration of EDTA, which indicates the requirement of a divalent metal ion for activity. The metal ion could be replaced by 10 mm Ca2+, although the enzyme activity fell by about 60%, whereas 10 mm Mn2+ and Zn2+ led to a severely decreased activity. 1 mm Mg2+ or Mn2+ gave about 40% of the activity observed with 10 mm Mg2+, whereas 1 mm Ca2+ and Zn2+ hardly activated the enzyme. The pH optimum for the enzyme reaction was shown to be 6.0. Structure of DGGGPS—To determine the structural property of S. solfataricus DGGGPS, we compared its amino acid sequence with those of its orthologues encoded in the genomes of various archaea, i.e. thermophilic, methanogenic, and halophilic archaea, and other prenyltransferases homologous with DGGGPS, such as E. coli UbiA 4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase, E. coli MenA 1,4-dihydroxy 2-naphthoate octaprenyltransferase, Arabidopsis thaliana homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT), Synechococcus ChlG chlorophyllide a phytyltransferase, and E. coli CyoE protoheme IX farnesyltransferase. As a result, these enzymes, all classified in the “UbiA prenyltransferase family” according to the Pfam protein family data base, contain a highly conserved region (Fig. 5). The corresponding region in E. coli UbiA and COQ2, the UbiA orthologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was predicted to be the prenyl diphosphate-binding site, suggesting that archaeal DGGGPSs catalyze prenyl transfer reactions via the same mechanism as the other UbiA-related prenyltransferases. Moreover, all the enzymes classified in this family are considered to be, and some have been shown (22Muhlenweg A. Melzer M. Li S.M. Heide L. Planta. 1998; 205: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Melzer M. Heide L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), to be membrane-intrinsic, unlike other prenyltransferases such as GGPS and GGGPS. In fact, the hydrophobicity plot of S. solfataricus DGGGPS was very similar with that of E. coli UbiA, and they clearly show that the enzymes contain multiple transmembrane regions (data not shown). Phylogenetic Analysis of Membrane-intrinsic Prenyltransferases—To clarify the evolutional relationships between DGGGPS and other members of UbiA prenyltransferase family, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the amino acid sequences of S. solfataricus DGGGPS, its 5 orthologues from various archaea, 11 typical members of the UbiA prenyltransferase family, and 2 orthologues of such prenyltransferases from S. solfataricus, encoded in SSO0125 and SSO0656 (Fig. 6). In this tree, the existence of six clusters can be found, in which enzymes catalyzing similar reactions are included, i.e. the clusters of DGGGPS (light blue area), UbiA/COQ2 (orange area), CyoE/COX10 (pink area), ChlG/BchG (green area), HPT (purple area), and MenA (yellow area). A bootstrap analysis indicated that all of the clusters are apparently independent from each other. However, unlike the other clusters, the cluster of archaeal DGGGPS orthologues appears to be located near the center of the tree, from which the other clusters branch out distantly. The two S. solfataricus homologues of UbiA-family prenyltransferases other than DGGGPS, SSO0125 (UbiA-1) and SSO0656, were located near the clusters of UbiA/COQ2 prenyltransferases for the biosynthesis of ubiquinone (and shikonin) and CyoE/COX10 prenyltransferases for heme biosynthesis, respectively. The UbiA prenyltransferase family of enzymes typically catalyze the transfer of a prenyl (or phytyl) group to hydrophobic acceptors. However, the structure of the acceptor molecules varies broadly. Examples include prenyl groups attached to a carbon atom in the aromatic ring of the precursors of quinones or tocopherol, a carboxyl oxygen in a propionate side chain of chlorophyllides, a carbon in an ethylene side chain of protoheme, and an oxygen in the glycerol moiety of GGGP. It should be emphasized here that DGGGPS from S. solfataricus is the first example of a UbiA family prenyltransferase that utilizes an acyclic prenyl acceptor substrate. The phylogenetic tree of the protein family clearly has several clusters of enzymes, and the clustered enzymes accept prenyl-acceptors, not donors, with similar structures. For example, geranyl diphosphate:4-hydroxybenzoate geranyltransferase from Lithospermum erythrorhizon, which is involved in shikonin biosynthesis, is included in the cluster of ubiquinone-biosynthetic UbiA/COQ2 polyprenyltransferases, which commonly accept 4-hydroxybenzoate. Considering the difference in the atoms to which the prenyl group is attached, it seems to be reasonable that the branches of chlorophyll- and heme-biosynthesizing enzymes are separated even though the structures of their prenyl-acceptor substrates, having a porphyrin ring, resemble each other. These facts indicate that the position of each enzyme in the tree clearly reflects its specificity for a prenyl-acceptor substrate. Therefore, the clustering of S. solfataricus DGGGPS and its probable orthologues from various archaea strongly suggests that they catalyze the same reaction. As the result of a homology search of the entire genome sequence, S. solfataricus appeared to possess two UbiA family prenyltransferases, in addition to DGGGPS, whereas their functions are currently unknown. One, which shows a high similarity with 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferases and is referred to as UbiA-1, is in close proximity to the UbiA/COQ2 proteins in the phylogenetic tree. Because the archaeon is known to use an anomalous respiratory quinone, caldariellaquinone, as a part of its respiratory system (24De Rosa M. De Rosa S. Gambacorta A. Minale L. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. 1977; 1: 653-657Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the prenyltransferase would be expected to be involved in the biosynthesis of caldariellaquinone. The other is located near the CyoE/COX10 farnesyltransferases for heme biosynthesis, which suggests that this prenyltransferase catalyzes the biosynthesis of heme-like compounds. Indeed, the closely related S. acidocaldarius was reported to produce heme As, the geranylgeranylated, not farnesylated, analogue of heme A (25Lübben M. Morand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21473-21479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through the data base search, we found that the genomes of archaea generally encode three to four proteins of the UbiA prenyltransferase family. However, the genomes of Pyrococcus sp., Methanopyrus kandleri, and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii encode only one homologue with a high similarity to DGGGPS, which suggests the absence of prenylated hemes and respiratory quinones in these archaea. Prenylated quinones, which were frequently used as an index for the classification of microorganisms, have not been found from the organisms as far as we are aware. In addition, the genomes of all of these archaea contain only one gene encoding the homologue of prenyl diphosphate synthase, which is considered to be the GGPP synthase that is involved in membrane lipid biosynthesis, whereas other organisms usually possess a distinct prenyl diphosphate synthase for the biosynthesis of the respiratory quinones. The evolutional routes of UbiA prenyltransferase family have been a subject of interest to us. Archaea and the other organisms can be uniquely distinguished not only by taxonomy based on rRNA sequences but also by the structures of their membrane lipids. This fact led us to the hypothesis that archaea were generated from the common ancestor of all living organisms at the same period in which they acquired a membrane formed by ether-linked lipids. The present situation with respect to archaeal lipid biosynthesis also could have been accomplished by the later replacement of a previously existing but unknown system for DGGGP production with a member of UbiA prenyltransferase family. The UbiA prenyltransferase family might have already been possessed by archaea for some different functions or could be supplied by lateral gene transfer from other organisms. However, we suspect this idea because various types of archea commonly have at least one gene encoding an orthologue of S. solfataricus DGGGPS and because the shape and bootstrap values of our phylogenetic tree clearly indicate that the cluster of the orthologues is independent from those of any other presently existing prenyltransferases. If our hypothesis, that the generations of archaea and their ether-linked lipids occurred at almost the same time, is true, then the history of DGGGPS could be considered to be as long as that of domain Archaea. The long evolutional history of DGGGPS might be supported by the early divergences observed among enzymes included in the DGGGPS cluster. Therefore, we can even imagine a scenario in which the archaeal enzyme played the role as the evolutional origin of all enzymes in this family, although the possibility of lateral transfer of prenyltransferase genes from other organisms to archaea cannot be ignored. In this scenario, some prenylated compounds such as respiratory quinones could have also come into existence first in archaeal cells, accompanying the duplication and subsequent evolution of prenyltransferases. In fact, several archaeal species possess respiratory quinones with unusual structures, e.g. caldariellaquinone, thermoplasmaquinone, and sulfolobusquinone, whereas many thermophilic and halophilic archaea produce menaquinones (26Gambacorta A. Trincone A. Nicolaus B. Lama L. De Rosa M. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 16: 518-527Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Such unusual prenylquinones and methanophenazine (27Abken H.J. Tietze M. Brodersen J. Bäumer S. Beifuss U. Deppenmeier U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Beifuss U. Tietze M. Bäumer S. Deppenmeier U. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 2470-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), a prenylated electron carrier compound that was recently discovered in a methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina mazei Gö1, which is known to have no prenylated quinone, might be the traces of the molecular evolution of membrane-bound electron carrier compounds in archaea. We have speculated as to why respiratory quinones, hemes, and chlorophylls contain prenyl groups as their hydrophobic side chains, whereas organisms other than archaea are also able to synthesize linear acyl groups. The above scenario answers at least a part of the question. Archaea seem to depend on isoprenoids more strongly than the other organisms, because almost all the lipoid compounds in archaea, e.g. membrane lipids, carotenoids, and respiratory quinones, are isoprenoids. Through the biological evolutional history, the roles that archaea have played in the generation of isoprenoid biosynthetic enzymes and, moreover, isoprenoid compounds themselves might be greater than previously expected. Archaea might be, so to speak, a cradle for isoprenoid biosynthesis. We are grateful to Drs. K. Ogura and T. Koyama, Tohoku University, for providing the prenyl diphosphates. We also thank M. Noike, Tohoku University, for the construction of the pET15b-SaGGPS plasmid."

Two pairs of naturally occurring ErbB4 isoforms differing in their juxtamembrane (JMa/JMb) and C termini (cyt1/cyt2) have been described. To examine the role of ErbB4 in neuron migration, we cloned and stably transfected each of the four ErbB4 isoforms in ST14A cells (a neural progenitor cell line derived from the striatum of embryonic day 14 rats) endogenously expressing the other members of the ErbB family: ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3. Using immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that the neuregulin-1β1 (NRG1β1) stimulus induced ErbB4 tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) recruitment and activation (as demonstrated by Akt phosphorylation) either directly (ErbB4 cyt1 isoform) or indirectly (ErbB4 cyt2 isoform). We examined the ability of the four ErbB4 isoforms to induce chemotaxis and cell proliferation in response to NRG1β1 stimulation. Using migration assays, we observed that only ErbB4-expressing cells stimulated with NRG1β1 showed a significant increase in migration, whereas the growth rate remained unchanged. Additional assays showed that inhibition of PI3K (but not of phospholipase Cγ) dramatically reduced migratory activity. Our data show that ErbB4 signaling via PI3K activation plays a fundamental role in controlling NRG1β1-induced migration.

The ErbB receptor family consists of four receptor tyrosine kinases named the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; NRG, neuregulin; HB-EGF, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; t, time; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. receptor, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (reviewed in Ref. 1Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent activation of ErbB receptors results in homo- or heterodimerization, which stimulates receptor trans-phosphorylation on cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, creating binding sites for adaptor or enzymatic proteins. EGF receptor and ErbB4 homodimers are active kinases in the absence of coreceptors, whereas ErbB3 (which has little or no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity) and ErbB2 (for which no ligand has been identified) necessitate coreceptor interaction for signal transduction (2Guy P.M.

Thus, whereas ErbB2 and ErbB3 are limited to heterodimerization, the EGF receptor and ErbB4 can be activated by either homo- or heterodimerization. An interesting ErbB4 feature (recently reviewed in Ref. 3Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) is the existence of isoforms generated by alternative splicing (4Junttila T.T. Sundvall M. Maatta J.A. Elenius K.

ErbB4 proteolytic cleavage produces a membrane-associated 80-kDa fragment that can be degraded by proteasome activity following polyubiquitination (8Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or that can be the substrate for subsequent γ-secretase cleavage, which releases the cytoplasmic domain from the membrane and allows, intriguingly, nuclear translocation of a fragment (9Ni C.-Y.

The existence of these isoforms suggests that potentially four isoforms may exist and evoke functional differences. Actually, in stable NIH3T3 transfectants, it has been shown that the ErbB4 isoform that does not activate PI3K (cyt2) mediates proliferation, but not survival or chemotaxis, as does cyt1 (13Kainulainen V.

ErbB4 ligands belong to two groups: the neuregulins (NRG1–4), also termed heregulins, and some members of the EGF family (betacellulin, epiregulin, and HB-EGF). NRG1 and NRG2 exist in a number of splicing isoforms and recognize also ErbB3 as a binding site, whereas NRG3 and NRG4 interact, with lower affinity, only with ErbB4 (1Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In most assays, NRG1 with a β-type EGF-like domain is 10–100 times more potent than NRG1 with an α-type EGF-like domain. Moreover, experiments performed with mice with targeted mutations showed that NRG1β is involved in nervous system and cardiac development, whereas NRG1α is involved in breast development (reviewed in Ref. 14Falls D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 14-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, NRG1 is expressed by both neurons and glia (15Pinkas-Kramarski R. Eilam R. Spiegler O.

Interestingly, cells coming out of the rostral migratory stream of the subependymal layer as well as isolated cells in the granule cell layer, possibly migrating cells, strongly express ErbB4, and ErbB4 immunoreactivity is found in all the periglomerular and mitral/tufted cells of the olfactory bulb (26Perroteau I.

Furthermore, ErbB4 is preferentially expressed by interneurons that migrate tangentially from the ventral to the dorsal rat telencephalon (29Yau H.J. Wang H.F. Lai C. Liu F.C. Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). ErbB4 knockout mice exhibit defects in cranial neural crest migration and cranial nerve segregation in the developing hindbrain, but die at embryonic day 10.5 because of abnormal heart development (30Gassmann M. Casagranda F. Orioli D. Simon H. Lai C. Klein R. Lemke G. Nature. 1995; 378: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 31Golding J.P. Trainor P. Krumlauf R. Gassmann M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, heart defects were rescued in mutant ErbB4 mice by expressing ErbB4 under the control of a cardiac-specific myosin promoter (32Tidcombe H. Jackson-Fisher A. Mathers K. Stern D.F. Gassmann M. Golding J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8281-8286Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Rescued mice display aberrant cranial nerve architecture and an increased number of large interneurons within the cerebellum. Expression of a dominant-negative ErbB4 construct in primary cultures of neuronal cells showed an additional ErbB4 requirement for cell migration in the developing cerebellum: the phenotype described includes defects in the migration of cerebellar granule cells (expressing NRGs) along radial glial fibers (usually expressing ErbB4) (33Rio C.

All of this evidence concerning a role for ErbB4 in cell migration in the nervous system prompted us to find a suitable in vitro model in which to investigate more deeply the involvement of ErbB4 in migration. For this purpose, we chose ST14A, an ErbB1/ErbB2/ErbB3-expressing cell line derived from embryonic day 14 rat striatal primordia by retroviral transduction of a temperature-sensitive allele of the SV40 large T antigen (34Cattaneo E. Conti L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this model, cell division and expression of nestin persist at 33 °C, the permissive temperature, whereas at the non-permissive temperature of 39 °C, cell division ceases, nestin expression decreases, and microtubule-associated protein-2 expression increases (35Ehrlich M.E.

Following intracerebral grafting procedures, ST14A cells develop into a high percentage of microtubule-associated protein-2- and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells, suggesting that they behave as multipotent neural progenitors (37Lundberg C.

In this study, we engineered ST14A cells to express ErbB4 and demonstrate that ErbB4 expression is necessary to confer on neural progenitor cells the ability to respond to NRG1β1 through migration. This response is shown to be mediated by PI3K activation either directly or indirectly through ErbB3 heterodimerization.

Conti L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on dishes (BD Biosciences) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were grown in medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Cells were grown as monolayers at the permissive temperature of 33 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere saturated with H2O. Cells were allowed to grow to near confluence, and adherent cells were harvested by the trypsin/EDTA method. The EGF-like domain of mouse NRG1β1 was produced in our laboratory as a His-tag fusion protein in Escherichia coli (41Mautino B. Dalla Costa L. Gambarotta G. Perroteau I. Fasolo A. Dati C. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (20 mm stock solution) and stored at –20 °C. The phospholipase Cγ inhibitor U73122 was dissolved in chloroform according to the manufacturer's instructions to a final concentration of 2 mm, divided in aliquots, lyophilized, stored at –20 °C, and resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide just before use to obtain a 2 mm stock solution. In all experiments, control samples received the same concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide or other vehicle. Polyclonal anti-ErbB4 (C-18, sc-283) and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99) primary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-PI3K p85 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt and anti-Akt antibodies were from Cell Signaling. Horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit and sheep anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Proliferation Assay—The proliferation assay was performed according to the protocol described by Kueng et al. (42Kueng W. Silber E. Eppenberger U. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in 200 μl of DMEM containing 10% FBS at a density of 1000 cells/well in 96-well plates. The following day (t = 0), the medium was replaced with 2% FBS-containing DMEM with or without 5 nm NRG1β1 (100 μl/well, 8 wells/treatment). For each plate, an 8-well line without cells was treated as the entire plate and used as a blank in the following microplate reader analysis. At t = 0, a 96-well plate was fixed and used as a cell growth starting point. Cell growth was subsequently calculated at 2 (t = 48 h), 4 (t = 96 h), and 6 (t = 144 h) days after the initiation of treatments. Briefly, the medium was removed, and cells were fixed by addition of 100 μl of 2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After being shaken (200 cycles/min) for 20 min at room temperature, plates were washed five times by submersion in deionized water and air-dried for at least 24 h. Plates were then stained by addition of a solution (100 μl/well) containing 0.1% crystal violet dissolved in freshly prepared 200 mm boric acid (pH 9.0). After being shaken (200 cycles/min) for 20 min at room temperature, plates were washed five times by submersion in deionized water and air-dried for at least 24 h. Bound dye was solubilized by addition of 10% acetic acid (100 μl/well) and 5 min of shaking at room temperature. The absorbance of dye extracts was measured directly in plates using a Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad) at a wavelength of 590 nm. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Cloning of Rat ErbB4 cDNAs—Total RNA was prepared from olfactory bulbs obtained from one adult Wistar rat (Charles River Laboratories) using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was subsequently reverse-transcribed to cDNA in a total volume of 25 μl using 200 units of reverse transcriptase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in 1× buffer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) with 7.5 μm random exanucleotide primers (Amersham Biosciences), 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences), 0.1 μg/μl acetylated bovine serum albumin (Amersham Biosciences), and 33 units of RNasin (Amersham Biosciences). As a control, an enzyme-less reaction was performed for each sample. PCRs were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 5 μl of cDNA, enzyme-less reaction sample, or water (negative controls), 250 nm each 5′- and 3′-primers (see below), 2.5 units of PfuTurbo® DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 100 μm dNTPs, and 5% glycerol. The primers used (produced by Sigma) were designed according to the GenBank™/EBI rat ErbB4 sequence (accession number NM_021687; corresponding to the JMa-cyt1 isoform, herein numbered considering the start site as +1): primer ErbB4-11 (5′-TGCTAGCCAA-AAATGAAGCTGGCG-3′, with the artificial NheI site underlined and the ATG codon in boldface) and primer ErbB4-4 (5′-GTTTCTCCTTCA-GGTACCCAGATTCC-3′) to obtain the amplicons corresponding to nucleotides –7 to +2228 and primer ErbB4-5 (5′-GCACAGCACCCAAT-CAAGCTC-3′) and primer ErbB4-6 (5′-TACTGGCCTTGGGGTAGAA-GGAAG-3′) to obtain the amplicons corresponding to nucleotides +2105 to +4025. Samples were amplified using a simplified touchdown PCR protocol: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min; followed by 10 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 66 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min; followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The extension step of the last cycle was increased to 30 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with UV light. A 1-kb DNA ladder (Invitrogen) or BenchTop pGEM DNA markers (Promega) was used as a size marker. PCR products were purified from agarose gel using the GenElute™ gel purification kit (Sigma). To obtain the full-length ErbB4 cDNAs, the previously obtained amplicons (nucleotides –7 to +2228 and nucleotides +2105 to +4025) were used as templates in the presence of primers ErbB4-11 and ErbB4-6 in recombinant PCR according to the following protocol: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 63 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 8 min. The extension step of the last cycle was increased to 30 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel, purified from agarose gel using the GenElute™ gel purification kit, and cloned into the pCR®-BluntII-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) using the Zero Blunt® TOPO® PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA of 18 single colonies was obtained using the GenElute™ plasmid miniprep kit (Sigma). For each clone, the orientation of the cDNA in the vector (sense or antisense) was detected by restriction enzyme digestions using EcoRI and BamHI (Amersham Biosciences). To identify the different ErbB4 isoforms (cyt1/cyt2 and JMa/JMb), individual sense clones were analyzed by PCR; the juxtamembrane domain (fragment +1773 to +2019) was amplified with primer ErbB-4-12 (5′-GAAATGTCCAGATGGCCTACAG-3′) and primer ErbB4-13 (5′-AACGGCAAATGTCAGAGCCATG-3′), and the cytoplasmic domain (fragment +3054 to +3267) was amplified with primer ErbB4-1 (5′-T-GCTGAGGAATATTTGGTCCCCCA-3′) and primer ErbB4-2 (5′-TCTG-GTATGGTGCTGGTTGTGGCT-3′). PCRs were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 5 μl of DNA or water (negative controls), 250 nm each specific primer, 1 unit of RED Taq™ DNA polymerase (Sigma), 100 μm dNTPs, and 5% glycerol. Samples were amplified by denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 63 °C (JMa/JMb) or 60 °C (cyt1/cyt2) for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The extension step of the last cycle was increased to 20 min. To amplify the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 544–732 (GenBank™/EBI accession number M32599), PCRs were carried out using primer GAPDH1 (5′-TGGCATTGTGGAAGGGCTCA-TTGAC-3′) and primer GAPDH2 (5′-ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTC-AGC-3′); samples were amplified by denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. For all PCRs, the Thermal Cycler GeneAmp® PCR System 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used. Sequencing of ErbB4 cDNAs—Two cDNA clones (3A and 3G) corresponding to the full-length JMa-cyt1 and JMa-cyt2 isoforms were completely sequenced on both strands (Genelab Laboratories, Rome, Italy). A cDNA clone (3E) corresponding to the JMb isoform was sequenced on both strands in the region between nucleotides –7 and +2196. The primers used for sequencing were designed according to the GenBank™/EBI rat ErbB4 sequence (accession number NM_021687). Expression Vectors—To generate stable cell lines expressing ErbB4 JMa-cyt1 and JMa-cyt2, the cDNAs corresponding to the two sequenced isoforms were subcloned into the pIRESpuro2 vector (Clontech); NheI-NotI fragments obtained from pCR®-BluntII-TOPO®-ErbB4 clones (containing the entire rat ErbB4 cDNAs) were subcloned into the NheI and NotI sites of pIRESpuro2. To generate stable cell lines expressing ErbB4 JMb-cyt1 and JMb-cyt2, a Csp45I-HpaI fragment containing the entire juxtamembrane region was obtained from the JMb-sequenced clone and used to replace the JMa region in clones pIRESpuro2-ErbB4-JMa-cyt1 and pIRESpuro2-ErbB4-JMa-cyt2, yielding pIRESpuro2-ErbB4-JMb-cyt1 and pIRESpuro2-ErbB4-JMb-cyt2, respectively. The rat ErbB3 expression vectors pcDNA3-B3 (43Hellyer N.J. Kim H.-H. Greaves C.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G.

Koland (Department of Pharmacology, University of Iowa, College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA). Transfections—For stable transfections, growing ST14A cells were transfected in triplicate with 10 μg of DNA for each construct using 20 μl of LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA was prepared using the GenElute™ endotoxin-free plasmid maxiprep kit (Sigma). Cells transfected with the pIRESpuro2 vector alone were generated to be used as controls. Cells were cultured in DMEM as described above; and 48 h after transfection, three different doses of puromycin (5, 10, and 20 μg/ml) for each construct were added to the three plates. Individual clones were recovered and screened for their ErbB4 expression level by Western blotting as described below. For transient transfections, growing COS-7 cells were transfected using specific combinations of expression plasmids as indicated. Briefly, 5 μg of each plasmid were mixed in 1 ml of PBS and added to 1 ml of PBS containing 800 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. COS-7 cells were washed twice with 10 ml of PBS, covered with the DNA/DEAE-dextran/PBS solution, and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. Then, 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.1 mm chloroquine were added to the cells, and the cells, spontaneously detached after severe resuspension, were split in two and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After removing the medium, cells were treated for 3 min with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10% Me2SO, washed once with DMEM, and finally covered with DMEM containing 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were washed with PBS and serum-starved in DMEM for an additional 24 h before NRG1β1 stimulation. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitation experiments, confluent cells grown on 10-cm dishes were serumstarved overnight. The following day, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate was added to both the untreated and treated cells for at least 30 min prior to addition of 5 nm NRG1β1. After 10 min of NRG1β1 stimulation, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and lysed for 20 min on ice with 500 μl of cold extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented just prior to use with 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). For immunoprecipitations to be assayed for PI3K activity, cells were lysed with 500 μl of cold lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm ZnCl2, and 10% glycerol supplemented just prior to use with 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the mixture of protease inhibitors) (45Graziani A. Gramaglia D. Cantley L.C. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22087-22090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were collected with a cell scraper, placed in microcentrifuge tubes, rocked at 4 °C for 10 min, and spun at 4 °C for 20 min at 11,000 × g to discard cell debris. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA kit for protein determination, and lysates (1.5–2 mg) were diluted to equal concentrations using extraction buffer (1 mg/ml). Agarose-conjugated protein A beads (50 μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) pre-washed three times with extraction buffer were preincubated for 45 min with primary antibody (1 μg/mg of protein), and lysates were added and incubated overnight with constant rotation at 4 °C.

Cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes were previously observed in human breast cancer cell lines, but their role in cell cycle regulation and transformation was not investigated. This report demonstrates that Cdk2 in cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes from mammary epithelial cells is phosphorylated on the activating phosphorylation site, Thr160. Furthermore, cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes catalyze Rb phosphorylation on multiple sites in vitro. As a model to investigate the biological and biochemical functions of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes, and the mechanisms by which cyclin D1 activates Cdk2, a cyclin D1-Cdk2 fusion gene was constructed. The cyclin D1-Cdk2 fusion protein expressed in epithelial cells was phosphorylated on Thr160 and catalyzed the phosphorylation of Rb on multiple sites in vitro and in vivo. Kinase activity was not observed if either the cyclin D1 or Cdk2 domain was mutationally inactivated. Mutational inactivation of the cyclin D1 domain prevented activating phosphorylation of the Cdk2 domain on Thr160. These results indicate that the cyclin D1 domain of the fusion protein activated the Cdk2 domain through an intramolecular mechanism. Cells stably expressing the cyclin D1-Cdk2 fusion protein exhibited several hallmarks of transformation including hyperphosphorylation of Rb, resistance to TGFβ-induced growth arrest, and anchorage-independent proliferation in soft agar. We propose that cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes mediate some of the transforming effects of cyclin D1 and demonstrate that the cyclin D1-Cdk2 fusion protein is a useful model to investigate the biological functions of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes.

Cyclin D1 provides a critical link between signaling initiated by extracellular growth factors and cell cycle regulation. Cyclin D1 levels in the mammary gland are regulated by steroid hormones and polypeptide growth factors, suggesting a unique role for cyclin D1 in mammary development (1Sicinski P. Donaher J.L.

Consistent with an important role for cyclin D1 in mammary gland function, mice lacking cyclin D1 fail to undergo normal lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy (1Sicinski P. Donaher J.L.

Mice lacking the assembly factor p27 fail to form active cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes and exhibit a phenotype similar to that observed in cyclin D1-deficient mice, including impaired lobuloalveolar differentiation and the inability to lactate (4Muraoka R.S.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 917-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Overexpression of cyclin D1 in the mouse mammary gland under the control of the MMTV promoter induces mammary hyperplasia and tumor formation, indicating that cyclin D1 levels control the rate of mammary epithelial cell proliferation (5Wang T.C. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 overexpression likely also contributes to human mammary tumorigenesis since cyclin D1 is overexpressed in ∼50% of human breast cancers (6Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Breast Cancer Res. 2002; 4: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Buckley M.F. Sweeney K.J. Hamilton J.A. Sini R.L. Manning D.L. Nicholson R.I. deFazio A. Watts C.K. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2127-2133PubMed Google Scholar). Given the role that cyclin D1 plays in mammary tumorigenesis, it is critical to understand the mechanisms by which cyclin D1 promotes cell proliferation and transformation.Active cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes phosphorylate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) releasing the repression of E2F-dependent transcription and allowing the expression of genes required for progression into the S-phase of the cell cycle. A mutant form of Cdk4 that is not inhibited by p16 induces tumorigenesis, indicating that deregulated cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes are capable of driving cancer formation (8Rane S.G. Cosenza S.C. Mettus R.V. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 also indirectly promotes cell proliferation by sequestering p21 and p27, resulting in the activation of Cdk2 (9Perez-Roger I. Kim S.H. Griffiths B. Sewing A. Land H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5310-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 10Bouchard C. Thieke K. Maier A. Saffrich R. Hanley-Hyde J. Ansorge W. Reed S. Sicinski P. Bartek J. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5321-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that cyclin D1 drives cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation through these two mechanisms. Interestingly, cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes were observed in earlier studies (11Dou Q.P. Molnar G. Pardee A.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12Dulic V. Drullinger L.F. Lees E. Reed S.I. Stein G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11034-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In one study, cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes were detected in 9 of 13 human mammary carcinomas (13Sweeney K.J. Swarbrick A. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2865-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes have been assumed to be catalytically inactive based on a report showing that cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus system were not phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase (CAK) containing cyclin H and Cdk7 (14Higashi H. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Saitoh S. Segawa K. Taya Y. Okuyama A. Nishimura S. Kitagawa M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).In the present study we show that cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes exist in both human mammary carcinoma cell lines and mouse mammary epithelial cells. In fact, these cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes are phosphorylated on the activating CAK phosphorylation site of Cdk2, Thr160. Isolated cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes phosphorylate histone H1 and Rb on sites preferred by Cdk2, as well as on sites preferred by Cdk4. Furthermore, we have constructed a cyclin D1-Cdk2 fusion protein to model the biological functions of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes. The cyclin D1-Cdk2 fusion protein phosphorylates Rb in vitro on sites preferred by Cdk2 and Cdk4. Stable expression of the cyclin D1-Cdk2 fusion protein confers anchorage-independent cell proliferation and resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of TGFβ. These data suggest that cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes mediate some of the transforming effects of cyclin D1 overexpression in cancers and may be a useful target for anti-cancer therapeutics.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assays, and Soft Agar Assays—NMuMG, MDA-MB-231, and HaCaT cells were propagated as described previously (15Law B.K.

Images of soft agar colonies were captured using an Olympus CK40 inverted microscope and an Olympus DP10 digital camera.Construction of Recombinant Adenoviruses, Recombinant Retroviruses, Stable Cell Lines, and Transient Transfections—Cdk2-His6, His6-p27, FLAG-Cyclin D1, and Cdk4-His6 were constructed by polymerase chain reaction using the primers -Cdk2-His6: 5′-TTTTGGATCCATGGAGAACTTCCAAAAG-3′; 5′-TTTTGAATTCTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGGAGTCGTTGATGGGGTAC-3′, His6-p27: 5′-TTTTGGATCCATGCATCATCATCATCATCATTCAAACGTGCGAGTGTCTAAC-3′; 5′-TTTTGAATTCTTACGTTTGACGTCTTCTGAG-3′, FLAG-Cyclin D1: 5′-TTTTGAATTCCCACCATGGACTATAAGGACGATGATGACAAAGAACACCAGCTCCTGTGCTGC-3′; 5′-TTTTCTCGAGTCAGATGTCCACATCTCG-3′, and Cdk4-His6: 5′-TTTTGGATCCATGGCTACCTCTCGATATGAG-3′; 5′-TTTTGAATTCTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGCTCCGGATTACCTTC ATC-3′, respectively, cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and the inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. These inserts were subcloned into the pAd-Track-CMV vector and adenoviruses were prepared using the pAd-Easy system (16He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The first reading frame encodes green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the second reading frame encodes the gene of interest. Adenoviruses were propagated in HEK 293 cells and viral titers were determined using a variation on the plaque assay in which the number of infectious particles was followed by the number of foci of GFP fluorescence produced in HEK 293 cells.

Anti-phospho-Rb antibodies specific for the Phospho-Ser780, -Ser807/Ser811, -Ser795 sites, and an antibody recognizing phospho-Tyr15 of Cdk2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies.

Protein bands corresponding to Cdk2 complex components were identified by the Vanderbilt Proteomics Laboratory, Mass Spectrometry Research Center. Briefly, bands were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The masses of the eluted peptides were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry using an Applied Biosystems Voyager 4700 mass spectrometer. Proteins corresponding to the bands of interest were identified by interrogating the Swiss-Prot and NCBInr protein databases with the acquired peptide mass maps and fragmentation spectra using GPS Explorer software (Applied Biosystems) running the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science). Searches were performed with mass accuracies of less than 20 ppm, allowing for 1 missed cleavage, complete carbamidomethylation of cysteine sulfhydryls, and partial oxidation of methionine residues.RESULTSCharacterization of Cyclin D1-Cdk2 Complexes from Human Carcinoma and Mouse Mammary Epithelial Cells—We previously showed that treatment of mouse mammary epithelial cells and human mammary carcinoma cells with TGFβ + rapamycin alters the subunit composition of Cdk2 complexes and alters Cdk2 intracellular localization (15Law B.K. Chytil A. Dumont N. Hamilton E.G. Waltner-Law M.E. Aakre M.E. Covington C. Moses H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8184-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 24Brown K.A. Roberts R.L. Arteaga C.L. Law B.K. Breast Cancer Res. 2004; 6: R130-R139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To systematically study TGFβ and rapamycin regulation of Cdk2 complexes we constructed a recombinant adenovirus encoding hexahistidine-tagged Cdk2 (Cdk2-His6) to allow the rapid purification and analysis of intact Cdk2 complexes. An adenovirus encoding GFP was used as a control for the purifications. Cdk2 complexes isolated from human mammary MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells consistently contained cyclin D1 (Fig. 1A). The levels of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes were not altered by TGFβ + rapamycin treatment. Similar results were obtained with human mammary MDA-MB-361 carcinoma cells (data not shown). A previous study demonstrated the presence of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes in human mammary carcinoma cell lines (13Sweeney K.J. Swarbrick A. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2865-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, whether cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes play a role in cell cycle regulation in mammary carcinoma cells or mammary epithelial cells has not been explored.To determine whether endogenous cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes are present in mouse mammary epithelial cells, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed in mouse mammary NMuMG cells (Fig. 1B). These experiments demonstrated that cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes were present in NMuMG cells and that their levels were unaffected by TGFβ, rapamycin, or TGFβ + rapamycin treatment. Strikingly, Cdk2 associated with cyclin D1 was phosphorylated on the cyclin-dependent kinase activating kinase site, Thr160, suggesting that cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes may be catalytically active.In addition to acting as a kinase, cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes might also regulate the cell cycle indirectly by sequestering p21 and p27. There is extensive evidence that cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes regulate the cell cycle through this mechanism; however, cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes have not been shown to perform a similar function. To determine the subunit structure of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes, NMuMG cells were co-infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding FLAG-epitope-tagged cyclin D1 and Cdk2-His6. Cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes were purified by sequential chromatography using TALON resin to bind His6-tagged Cdk2 and anti-FLAG-agarose resin to bind cyclin D1-containing complexes. Purified cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes from cells treated with TGFβ + rapamycin (lane 3) or left untreated (lane 2), or a control purification using GFP adenovirus (lane 1), were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by colloidal Coomassie staining (Fig. 1C). Individual bands were excised, subjected to trypsin digestion, and the peptides analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. These analyses indicated that the cyclin D1 complexes contained proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and p21 in a near stoichiometric ratio as judged by Coomassie staining. Interestingly, TGFβ + rapamycin treatment dramatically increased the amount of p27 present in cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes. This result is consistent with our previous study (15Law B.K. Chytil A. Dumont N. Hamilton E.G. Waltner-Law M.E. Aakre M.E. Covington C. Moses H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8184-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but extends these results by showing that TGFβ + rapamycin-induced p27 binding is independent of the cyclin (E, A, or D1) associated with Cdk2. The observation that cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes bind both p21 and p27 suggests that, like cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes, cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes sequester p21 and p27 and may indirectly activate cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes.p21 Stabilizes, but Is Not Required for the Formation of Cyclin D1-Cdk2 Complexes—The experiment in Fig. 1C involved overexpression of both cyclin D1 and Cdk2, so we examined NMuMG cells and cancer cell lines for the presence of endogenous cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes are present at relatively high levels in human HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells and NMuMG cells, and at lower levels in T98G glioblastoma cells or SW480 colorectal carcinoma cells (Fig. 2A). In addition to cyclin D1, Cdk2 complexes from NMuMG and HCT116 cells contained high levels of p21 and PCNA. In contrast, Cdk2 complexes from T98G and SW480 cells contained low levels of cyclin D1, p21, and PCNA. These results are consistent with the results in Fig. 1C, and suggest that cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes in rapidly growing NMuMG and HCT116 cells are part of a quaternary complex containing cyclin D1, Cdk2, p21, and PCNA. Interestingly, Cdk2 immunoprecipitated from all four cell lines associated with similar amounts of E2F4, p107, and p130. This observation suggests that different subsets of Cdk2-containing complexes may be differentially regulated by cellular levels of p21, p27, or PCNA.Fig. 2p21 stabilizes, but is not required for, the formation of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes.A, extracts from the indicated cell lines were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibodies specific for Cdk2, E2F4, or normal rabbit IgG (Rab.

Equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibodies to Cdk2, or normal rabbit serum (Rab.

However, it is unclear whether p21 or p27 is required for the formation of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes. To address this question, extracts from parental or p21-null HCT116 cells were examined for the presence of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2B). Cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes were present in both parental and p21-null HCT116 cells that were either rapidly growing or rendered quiescent by serum deprivation. The levels of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes were slightly decreased in p21-null HCT116 cells suggesting that although p21 is not absolutely required for the formation of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes, p21 may stabilize these complexes. Cdk2 complexes from neither parental nor p21-null HCT116 cells contained significant amounts of p27, indicating that p27 did not substitute as a cyclin D1-Cdk2 assembly factor in the absence of p21 (data not shown). p21 deletion prevented PCNA binding to cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes. This was expected based on previous studies showing that p21 binds Cdk2 through its N terminus while p21 binds PCNA through its C terminus and serves to bridge Cdk2 and PCNA (27Nakanishi M.

To assay the kinase activity of cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes, NMuMG cells were infected with adenovirus encoding Cdk2-His6, and cyclin D1-Cdk2 complexes were isolated by chromatography on TALON resin followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-cyclin D1 antibodies. These complexes exhibited kinase activity when assayed using Histone H1 as the substrate and exhibited Cdk2 phosphorylation on Thr160 (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Cyclin D1 and Cdk2 form catalytically active kinase complexes that phosphorylate Rb and activate E2F-dependent transcription.A, NMuMG cells were infected with adenoviruses (Ad) encoding GFP or Cdk2-His6 as indicated and incubated 48 h. Cell extracts were prepared and purified over TALON resin. Proteins eluted from the TALON resin were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibodies to cyclin D1 or a nonspecific isotype control antibody (NS IgG1). Immunoprecipitates were assayed for kinase activity using histone H1 as the substrate. Kinase assay results were visualized using a phosphorimager.

Here we report the presence of rhodopsin kinase and recoverin in DRMs that were isolated in either light or dark conditions at high and low Ca2+ concentrations. Inhibition of rhodopsin kinase activity by recoverin was more effective in DRMs than in the initial rod outer segment membranes. Furthermore, the Ca2+ sensitivity of rhodopsin kinase inhibition in DRMs was shifted to lower free Ca2+ concentration in comparison with the initial rod outer segment membranes (IC50 = 0.76 μm in DRMs and 1.91 μm in rod outer segments). We relate this effect to the high cholesterol content of DRMs because manipulating the cholesterol content of rod outer segment membranes by methyl-β-cyclodextrin yielded a similar shift of the Ca2+-dependent dose-response curve of rhodopsin kinase inhibition. Furthermore, a high cholesterol content in the membranes also increased the ratio of the membrane-bound form of recoverin to its cytoplasmic free form.

Phototransduction in retinal rod and cone cells is started with the absorption of light by the photopigment rhodopsin, a seven-transmembrane helix receptor. Activated rhodopsin (metarhodopsin II) couples to a heterotrimeric G-protein, transducin, and thereby activates the visual enzymatic cascade that leads to the amplified hydrolysis of cGMP by cGMP-phosphodiesterase (1Pugh Jr., E.N.

Cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels in the photoreceptor plasma membrane are opened by cGMP in the dark and closed after hydrolysis of cGMP in light.

Taken together, these results point to a spatial heterogeneity of visual transduction in ROSs. In fact, single photon responses recorded from the tip of a toad ROS are smaller in amplitude and slower than responses recorded from the base. Background light reduces flash sensitivity at the tip more than at the base (25Schnapf J.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 343: 147-159Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although this spatial heterogeneity of the light response has been known for more than 20 years, it has not been understood at the cellular and molecular levels. Recent reports have stimulated discussion about the spatial heterogeneity of the rod light response. Detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) or lipid rafts that contain a high cholesterol/phospholipid ratio have recently been isolated from bovine ROSs (26Nair K.S. Balasubramanian N. Slepak V.Z. Curr.

A light-dependent translocation into DRMs has been demonstrated for transducin; its effector, cGMP-phosphodiesterase; the shorter splice variant of arrestin p44; and the RGS9-Gβ5L complex (26Nair K.S.

ROM-1, a disk membrane protein, which probably functions as an adaptor protein, was copurified with DRM fractions but only showed a modest light-dependent distribution between the DRMs and the detergent-soluble fractions (28Boesze-Battaglia K. Dispoto J. Kahoe M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41843-41849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Caveolin and membrane guanylate cyclase (probably retina-specific ROS-GC1) reside in DRMs but do not show any light-dependent translocation (26Nair K.S. Balasubramanian N. Slepak V.Z. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Rod function is under dynamic control of Ca2+-mediated feedback loops, and Ca2+ regulates the longitudinal transport of transducin (17Pulvermüller A. Giessl A. Heck M. Wottrich R. Schmitt A. Ernst O.P. Choe H.-W. Hofmann K.P. Wolfrum U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2194-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether any signaling proteins different from those mentioned above associate with DRMs or whether Ca2+ is involved in this association. In the present study, we investigated this issue as applied to the Ca2+ sensor recoverin and its target, rhodopsin kinase, to answer questions regarding whether these proteins associate with DRMs and which functional consequences follow from such an interaction. Isolation of DRMs from Bovine Rod Outer Segments—ROSs from bovine retinae were purified according to a previously published procedure (15Koch K.-W. Lambrecht H.-G. Haberecht M. Redburn D. Schmidt H.H.H.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). DRMs or lipid rafts were isolated from bovine ROSs by the following procedure of Nair et al. (26Nair K.S. Balasubramanian N. Slepak V.Z. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, ROSs were adjusted to ∼10 mg/ml rhodopsin in buffer A (100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). For one gradient, 500 μl of ROSs in buffer A were mixed with 2 ml of buffer B (12.5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgCl2, and 0.63% (v/v) Triton X-100) and incubated for 5 min on ice or at 4 °C. This solution was mixed with 2.5 ml of 80% (w/v) sucrose in an ultracentrifuge tube. The mixture was then carefully overlaid with 4.6 ml of 30% sucrose and 2.3 ml of 5% sucrose. Samples were centrifuged at 24,000 rpm in SW-41 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C overnight. The whole procedure was performed in either dim red light (dark) or under daylight conditions. In some preparations, CaCl2 was replaced by 1 mm EGTA. When gradients were run for comparison, exactly the same amount of ROS was loaded on the gradient. In addition, we increased the Triton X-100 concentration that was used for solubilization to 1% and 2% (v/v). Alternatively, we isolated DRMs according to the procedure of Boesze-Battaglia et al. (28Boesze-Battaglia K. Dispoto J. Kahoe M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41843-41849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, we collected ∼24 fractions (500 μl) of the gradient from bottom to the top using a glass capillary tube and a perstaltic pump. Determination of Rhodopsin and Cholesterol—Rhodopsin concentration in purified ROSs or in fractions obtained after DRM isolation and fractionation was determined spectrophotometrically at 498 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 40,000 m–1 × cm–1. The amount of rhodopsin (in mg) in each of the 25 fractions was summed up and set as 100%. Numbering starts with fractions at the top. Cholesterol was determined by a diagnostic kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma and Rolf Greiner Biochemica, Flacht, Germany). The principle of the assay is as follows: cholesterol is oxidized to cholest-4-en-3-one and H2O2 by cholesterol oxidase. H2O2 was allowed to react with hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-aminoantipyrin in the presence of peroxidase to yield chinomeimin, a dye that can be measured spectrophotometrically at 530 nm. Adjusting Cholesterol in ROS Membranes—The cholesterol exchange between methyl-β-cyclodextrin and ROSs was performed as described previously (24Niu S.-L. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, urea-washed ROS membranes (30 μm rhodopsin) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm NaCl, and 30 mm KCl were incubated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin in the presence or absence of 2 mm cholesterol. Mixtures were incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 2 h. Afterward, ROS membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 29,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 5% (w/v) Ficoll. Aliquots of this suspension were layered on top of 31% sucrose in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and overlaid with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Tubes were spun for 3 h at 21,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-28 rotor. Layers with ROS membranes were collected with a syringe and washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The cholesterol content of each sample was measured by using the Amplex red kit (Molecular Probes), according to the manufacturer's directions. Cholesterol content is expressed as a percentage (w/w) of phospholipids. Phospholipid content was determined as follows. Lipids were extracted from ROS membrane suspensions by chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v) and by a second extraction step using chloroform-methanol-HCl (200:100:1, v/v). Further processing of the lipid-containing fractions was as described previously (31Wuthier J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 7: 558-561Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Phospholipids in the lipid extract from ROS membranes were analyzed by normal phase HPLC (silica gel cartridge, 0.46 × 20 cm; Vydac) essentially as described previously (32Hurst W.J. Martin R.A. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1984; 61: 1462-1463Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Letter W.S. J. Liquid Chromatogr. 1992; 15: 253-266Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Brouwers J.F.H.M.

Known standards of phospholipids were injected into the HPLC to quantitate the unknown phospholipid content of ROS membranes. Purification of Recoverin and Phosphorylation of Rhodopsin—Myristoylated recoverin was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from a cell extract as described previously (35Senin I.I.

Phosphorylation of rhodopsin was assayed as described in Ref. 35Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philipov P.P. Koch K.-W. J. Biol.

Free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]free) was adjusted as described previously (35Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philipov P.P. Koch K.-W. J. Biol.

Immediately after illumination of the mixture (100% bleaching of rhodopsin), ATP was added to start the reaction, which was stopped 20 min later or by the addition of the 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE of the samples, zones of rhodopsin were cut out, and 32P incorporation was estimated by Cherenkov counting. Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—Hydrophobic L1 sensor chips (Biacore, Stockholm, Sweden) were used to immobilize lipid mixtures of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol. Recoverin was applied in the mobile phase in running buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm CaCl2) at a flow rate at 5 μl/min. Details of surface plasmon resonance experiments and analysis have been described elsewhere (35Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philipov P.P. Koch K.-W. J. Biol.

Other Methods—Equilibrium centrifugation assay for the binding of recoverin to liposomes, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting have been described previously (8Frins S. Bönigk W. Müller F. Kellner R.

Antibodies for Western blotting were from the following sources and used at indicated dilutions: polyclonal anti-recoverin (Ref. 38Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.-W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1160: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; 1:10,000) and polyclonal anti-ROS-GC1 (Ref. 39Hwang J.-Y. Lange C. Helten A. Höppner-Heitmann D. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Koch K.-W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 1:1,000). Polyclonal anti-rhodopsin kinase (1:1,000), polyclonal anti-transducin α (1:1,000), and polyclonal anti-caveolin (1:200) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). We isolated a Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fraction from bovine ROS using a sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Samples were fractionated after the centrifugation step, and the cholesterol content along the gradient was determined by a colorimetric assay. Almost all cholesterol was found in a peak that centered around fraction 6 (Fig. 1A). This distribution pattern of cholesterol was not changed significantly when we performed the whole isolation procedure either in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA, after illumination, or in the dark (Fig. 1A). The main cholesterol peak coincided with the position of a nearly transparent yellow band at the boundary between 5% and 30% sucrose. This band (boundary fraction) has previously been identified as DRMs or lipid rafts from ROS (26Nair K.S. Balasubramanian N. Slepak V.Z. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Seno K. Kishimoto M. Abe M. Higuchi Y. Mieda M. Owada Y. Yoshiyama W. Liu H. Hayashi F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41843-41849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The rhodopsin distribution along the sucrose gradient was analyzed by absorption measurements. The main portion of rhodopsin was solubilized by Triton X-100 and found in fractions 12–23 (89%); a smaller portion of ∼10% was found at the 5% and 30% sucrose boundary (fractions 5–9) and comigrated with the cholesterol peak (Fig. 1B). Up to 23% rhodopsin was found in DRMs. Fractions 1 and 2 contained only 1% rhodopsin. The presence of rhodopsin in DRMs is consistent with previous observations (27Seno K. Kishimoto M. Abe M. Higuchi Y. Mieda M. Owada Y. Yoshiyama W. Liu H. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20813-20816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A critical parameter for solubilization of rhodopsin was the rhodopsin/Triton X-100 ratio. For example, when we treated ROSs containing 4.5–4.6 mg/ml rhodopsin with 0.5% or 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, the amount of rhodopsin and other proteins in DRMs was similar at both detergent concentrations. However, decreasing the start amount of rhodopsin to 1.7 mg/ml in either 1% or 2% Triton X-100 led to almost complete solubilization of rhodopsin (<1% rhodopsin in DRMs). The cholesterol peak at the boundary between 5% and 30% sucrose also decreased by increasing Triton X-100: whereas at 0.5% Triton X-100, nearly 100% of total cholesterol comigrated with the boundary fraction, it was 37% and 12% of total cholesterol at 1% Triton X-100 and 2% Triton X-100, respectively. These results showed that rhodopsin was completely solubilized under conditions that left a significant amount of cholesterol associated with the boundary fraction. We further tested by Western blotting whether other ROS membrane proteins known to be associated with DRMs (26Nair K.S. Balasubramanian N. Slepak V.Z. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Seno K. Kishimoto M. Abe M. Higuchi Y. Mieda M. Owada Y. Yoshiyama W. Liu H. Hayashi F. J. Biol.

Commun. 2003; 303: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) are present in our DRM preparation. Guanylate cyclase ROS-GC1 and cGMP-phosphodiesterase were present in DRM and non-DRM fractions; transducin showed a clear light-dependent translocation into the DRM fraction (data not shown). Caveolin, a marker protein for lipid rafts, was found almost exclusively in the DRM fraction (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, less caveolin was detected in DRMs after illumination (Fig. 2A). Although the intensity of caveolin staining was variable, we observed this light-dependent distribution of caveolin in two independent fractionation studies. It is known that caveolin associates in a cholesterol-dependent manner with transducin (29Elliott M.H. Fliesler S.J. Ghalayini A.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7892-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and that transducin undergoes a light-dependent translocation from the outer segment to the inner segment (17Pulvermüller A.

A combination of these two effects could explain our observation. In summary, we conclude from these results that our DRM preparation from bovine ROS contains the same signaling proteins as reported by other investigators. It is therefore suitable for our further investigations. When we probed all fractions of the gradient by antibodies against recoverin and rhodopsin kinase, both proteins were detected in the DRM and non-DRM fraction. A comparison of the gradients run in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA under dark or light conditions showed in all cases the presence of recoverin and rhodopsin kinase in the DRM fraction and a clear segregation between DRM and non-DRM fractions (Fig. 2A). However, the relative amount of each protein in DRMs was influenced by Ca/EGTA and/or by illumination. For example, recoverin in the DRM fraction decreased after illumination in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 2A). Distribution of rhodopsin kinase resembled that of recoverin, but the presence of rhodopsin kinase became most prominent after illumination in the presence of Ca2+. The relative amount of recoverin and rhodopsin kinase in DRMs varied among different preparations, as can be seen best in a comparison of Fig. 2A with Fig. 2B. The effect of switching from Ca2+ to EGTA during DRM isolation is more pronounced in Fig. 2B because the presence of EGTA reduced the amount of recoverin and rhodopsin kinase in the DRM fraction. We next asked whether the inhibition of rhodopsin kinase activity by recoverin in DRMs differs from the inhibition in ROS membranes. In titration experiments, we varied either the recoverin concentration at saturating [Ca2+]or[Ca2+]free at a constant recoverin concentration. At saturating [Ca2+], inhibition of rhodopsin kinase occurred at slightly lower recoverin concentrations (Fig. 3A). However, when we compared the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin in ROS membranes with that in isolated DRMs, we observed a significant shift of the IC50 to lower free Ca2+ concentrations (from 1.91 μm in ROS membranes to 0.76 μm in DRMs) (Fig. 3B). Thus, recoverin was more effective as an inhibitor of rhodopsin kinase in DRMs than it was in ROS membranes. Overall activity of rhodopsin kinase without interference by recoverin was identical in ROS membranes and DRMs for nearly 20 min of incubation. Longer incubation times showed ∼20% lower kinase activity in ROS membranes. Because cholesterol is a main constituent of DRMs, we tested how cholesterol influenced the membrane association and inhibitory properties of recoverin. The cholesterol content of native bovine ROS membranes was manipulated by treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and the binding of recoverin was measured by a centrifugation equilibrium assay. Native ROS membranes contained, on average, 14% cholesterol. Decreasing the cholesterol content to 4.1% also decreased the amount of bound recoverin, whereas an increase of choleste"

These genes have been demonstrated to negatively regulate cell cycle progression, the activity of cdk2, and the degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. To date, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that tuberin binds to p27. Whereas tuberin also binds p27 in TSC1-negative cells, hamartin does not bind p27 without tuberin. p27 protein levels are regulated through ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Skp2 is the F-box protein, which, together with other proteins, forms an SCF (Skp1/cullin/F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex whose task is to target p27 for degradation by the proteasome. We found that neither tuberin nor hamartin are in a complex with Skp2. Tuberin does not affect Skp2 protein levels, and the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase does not regulate tuberin stability. But binding of tuberin to p27 sequesters p27 from Skp2 accompanied by an up-regulation of the p27 interaction with cdk2. Skp2-induced p27 degradation and cell cycle progression is abolished by tuberin′s protective binding to p27.

It is characterized by the development of benign tumors called hamartomas in the kidneys, heart, skin, and brain. The latter often cause seizures, mental retardation, and a variety of developmental disorders, including autism (1Kwiatkowski D.J. Ann. Hum.

TSC patients carry a mutant TSC1 or TSC2 gene in each of their somatic cells, and loss of heterozygosity has been documented in a wide variety of TSC tumors. In mammalian cells hamartin and tuberin form a complex, providing a tentative explanation for the similar disease phenotype in TSC patients with mutations in either of these genes (4Plank T.L.

Recent studies of Drosophila and mammalian cells demonstrated that the TSC1-TSC2 complex functions as a GTPase-activating protein against Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), which, in turn, regulates mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling. Several investigations have shown that the TSC1-TSC2 complex antagonizes the mTOR signaling network, which has a central role in the regulation of cell growth in response to growth factors, cellular energy, and nutrient levels (recently reviewed in Refs. 6Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.-L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (327) Google Scholar and 7Pan D. Dong J. Zhang Y. Gao X. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 78-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Work on mammalian cells has implicated the TSC proteins in cell cycle regulation. In the mammalian cell cycle, the transition from the G0/G1 phase to S phase, in which DNA replication occurs, has been shown to be regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). Mitogen-dependent d-type cyclins are expressed first during early G1. These cyclins associate with cdk4 or cdk6 to form an active kinase complex that phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein and thereby activates E2F transcriptional activity. Among the genes activated via members of the E2F protein family are cyclin E, which, complexed with cdk2, promotes the G1/S transition by phosphorylation of different substrates, and cyclin A, which activates cdk2 to further initiate DNA replication (8Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two families of cdk inhibitors are known, namely the INK4 family (p15, p16, p18, and p19), which regulates cdk4 and cdk6, and the Cip/Kip family (p21, p27, and p57), which inhibits a broader range of cdks (9Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). Antisense inhibition of TSC2 expression induces quiescent fibroblasts to enter the cell cycle, and TSC2-negative cells exhibit a shortened G1 phase. Overexpression of TSC1 or TSC2 negatively regulates cell cycle progression. Tuberin down-regulates the activity of cdk2, and p27 stability is decreased in tuberin-negative cells (10Soucek T. Pusch O.

Whereas p27 mRNA expression is not regulated during the cell cycle, degradation of p27 protein by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is a critical event for cell cycle progression (13Pagano M. Tam S.W.

The attachment of a chain of ubiquitin molecules to a protein by the concerted efforts of E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) targets the substrate for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (14Peters J.M.

Skp2 is the F-box protein, which, together with Skp1, Cul-1, and Roc1/Rbx1, forms an SCF (Skp1/cullin/F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex whose task is to target p27 for degradation by the proteasome (16Carrano A.C.

Tuberin sequesters p27 from Skp2 and triggers an up-regulation of the amount of p27 bound to cdk2. Tuberin abolishes Skp2-mediated p27 degradation and cell cycle progression. This finding suggests how p27 levels can be down-regulated in tuberous sclerosis hamartomas without mutation or loss at the p27 gene. Regulation of the protein-ubiquitin ligase and activation of the substrate are known strategies to target cell cycle regulatory proteins for ubiquitination. Here, we demonstrate that substrate protection via binding to a tumor suppressor protein is an additional mechanism.

Tuberin Binds to p27—Tuberin is known to be a potent regulator of p27 stability (11Soucek T. Yeung R.S. Hengstschläger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15653-15658Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed immunoprecipitations using protein extracts of logarithmically growing HEK 293 cells, EEF4 cells, and HeLa cells with a p27-specific antibody. Immunoblot analyses revealed that tuberin can be detected in p27-containing protein complexes in all three cell lines (Fig. 1A). To confirm this interaction of p27 and tuberin by using another antibody, HEK 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged p27. In protein extracts of these transfected cells, co-immunoprecipitation of tuberin with an anti-FLAG antibody could be detected (Fig. 1B). The anti-FLAG antibody leads to a slightly disproportionate signal (compare the signals specific for FLAG and for p27 in Fig. 1B), which is likely to be due to the high specificity of the anti-FLAG antibody. In the analyzed logarithmically growing cell lines, endogenous p27 levels have been found to be low, as is expected in cycling cells (Fig. 1A, p27 short exposure and p27 long exposure). Accordingly, p27 can only be detected in tuberin-specific immunoprecipitations after the overexpression of p27 (Fig. 1C). The finding that transfection of ectopic p27 is required to visualize p27 in tuberin-specific immunoprecipitates is in agreement with previous results demonstrating that p27 could not be detected in a tuberin immunoprecipitation assay in untransfected cells (11Soucek T. Yeung R.S. Hengstschläger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15653-15658Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To provide further confirmation that the detection of tuberin in immunoprecipitates with the anti-p27 antibody specifically depends on p27 interacting with tuberin, we used protein extracts of p27-negative cells. We found that the anti-p27 antibody does not co-immunoprecipitate tuberin in p27-negative cells (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these data demonstrate a specific physical interaction of tuberin and p27 in vivo in four different cell lines of three species (human HEK 293 cells, human HeLa cells, rat EEF4 cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts). Hamartin Is in the Tuberin-p27 Complex—Hamartin and tuberin form a heterodimer, and this interaction appears to be important for the stability of both proteins (4Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar, 5Van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol.

Sci. 2003; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Therefore, hamartin and tuberin are usually considered to be a complex with one function. p27-specific immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblot detection of tuberin, hamartin, and p27 revealed that hamartin can also be found in a complex with p27 in logarithmically growing HEK 293 cells and HeLa cells (Fig. 2). To investigate the role of the interaction of tuberin and hamartin for the complex formation with p27, we used TSC1-negative CACL-1-II cells and TSC2-negative Lk9dR cells. Tuberin could be detected in p27-specific immunoprecipitates of hamartin-negative CACL-1-II cells (Fig. 2). This finding demonstrates that the binding of tuberin to p27 does not depend on tuberin′s interaction with hamartin. On the contrary, hamartin cannot be detected in a complex with p27 in tuberin-negative Lk9dR cells (Fig. 2). These data suggest that the effects of tuberin on p27 expression could be due to direct interaction, whereas hamartin affects p27 by its influences on tuberin stability/activity. This idea also fits with the earlier observation that the effects of hamartin on p27 are less pronounced than the effects of tuberin (11Soucek T. Yeung R.S. Hengstschläger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15653-15658Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Miloloza A. Rosner M. Nellist M. Halley D. Bernaschek G. Hengstschläger M. Hum. Mol.

Interestingly, earlier findings suggested that hamartin can also regulate cell proliferation in tuberin-negative cells, but without effects on p27 protein levels (24Miloloza A. Kubista M. Rosner M. Hengstschläger M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism for this additional capacity of hamartin remains elusive, the finding that hamartin is not in a complex with p27 in tuberin-negative cells could explain why hamartin cannot regulate p27 in these cells. Tuberin and Hamartin Are Not in a Complex with Skp2— Skp2 is the F-box protein, which is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex whose task is to target p27 for degradation by the proteasome.

Astrocytes derived from Niemann-Pick type C lipidosis (NPC1–/–) mice displayed late endosomal cholesterol deposits, but the secretion of biosynthetic sterols from the cells was not inhibited. Both wild-type and NPC1–/– astrocytes secreted the NPC2 protein. Size-exclusion chromatography combined with electron microscopy showed that the majority of sterols were secreted separately from NPC2 in heterogeneous spherical particles with an average diameter of 20 nm. These data suggest that NPC2 and the majority of sterols secreted from astrocytes are not released together and that the secretion of neither sterols nor NPC2 requires NPC1 function. In addition, the findings reveal a complexity of sterol species in astrocytes and bring up the possibility that some of the effects assigned to astrocyte cholesterol may be attributed to its penultimate precursors.

The brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the body, containing roughly 25% of the unesterified cholesterol present in the whole individual. The input of cholesterol into the brain comes entirely, or almost entirely, from in situ synthesis because blood lipoproteins do not cross the blood-brain-barrier (1Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Glial cells are thought to be responsible for a large part of this biosynthetic activity. Most of the sterol in the brain is acquired during myelination in the early stages of development and is produced by oligodendrocytes (2Snipes G.J. Suter U. Bittman R. Subcellular Biochemisty. 28. Plenum Press, New York, NY1997: 173-204Google Scholar). Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells, are intimately associated with neuronal synapses and secrete cholesterol in lipoprotein particles. Astrocytes have been proposed to provide cholesterol for synapse formation (3Mauch D.H. Nagler K. Schumacher S. Goritz C. Muller E.C. Otto A. Pfrieger F.W. Science. 2001; 294: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar) as well as to participate in the recycling of cholesterol after injury (4Danik M. Champagne D. Petit-Turcotte C. Beffert U. Poirier J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 357-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Nascent lipoproteins isolated from neonatal mouse astrocytes are a heterogeneous population of particles in the size range of plasma high density lipoproteins and appear to be composed of two separate classes that contain either apolipoprotein E or J (5Fagan A.M. Holtzman D.M. Munson G. Mathur T. Schneider D. Chang L.K. Getz G.S. Reardon C.A. Lukens J. Shah J.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol.

Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, Niemann-Pick type C disease; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; SFV, Semliki Forest virus; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is an inherited, fatal neurodegenerative disorder in which large amounts of cholesterol and sphingolipids accumulate intracellularly within late endocytic organelles. The disease is caused by mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene (6Patterson M.C. Neurologist. 2003; 9: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The NPC1 protein is a late endosomal membrane protein harboring a sterol-sensing domain, whereas NPC2 is a secretory protein that has cholesterol binding properties and uses the mannose 6-phosphate marker for late endosomal targeting (7Ikonen E. Hölttä-Vuori M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The exact functions of the proteins remain unknown, but genetic evidence suggests that they function in concert to facilitate lysosomal lipid egress (8Sleat D.E. Wiseman J.A. El-Banna M. Price S.M. Verot L. Shen M.M. Tint G.S. Vanier M.T. Walkley S.U. Lobel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5886-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In the NPC1–/– mouse astrocytes are considered to contribute to neurodegeneration (9Patel S.C. Suresh S. Kumar U. Hu C.Y. Cooney A. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Neufeld E.B. Patel R.C. Brady R.O.

Neuroscience. 2002; 109: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NPC1–/– astrocytes were shown to have defects in the trafficking of endogenously synthesized cholesterol (11Reid P.C. Sugii S. Chang T.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1010-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have previously analyzed cholesterol biosynthesis and sterol efflux to extracellular acceptors in non-neuronal cells. In both fibroblastic and hepatic cells, the individual precursor sterols identified were released differentially from each other and from cholesterol (12Lusa S. Heino S. Ikonen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19844-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed the synthesis and secretion of cholesterol and late intermediates of cholesterol biosynthesis in wild-type (WT) and NPC1-deficient murine astrocytes. We show that specific cholesterol precursors represent major sterol species both within astrocytes and in astrocyte-derived sterol-carrying particles. Moreover, we provide evidence suggesting that the majority of cholesterol is not secreted together with NPC2 and that the release of neither sterols nor NPC2 depends on NPC1 function. Materials—Diethyl ether and petroleum ether were from J. T. Baker Inc.; all other HPLC-grade solvents, lovastatin, and the silica gel 60 TLC plates were from Merck. [4-14C]Cholesterol (specific activity 58 mCi/mmol), [1α,2α(n)-3H]cholesterol (specific activity 41.0 Ci/mmol), [3H]acetic acid (specific activity 5.10–9.00 Ci/mmol), Hybond-C membrane, and the ECL reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The polyclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody was from Dako, and anti-lysobisphosphatidic acid antibody (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) was a gift from Jean Gruenberg (University of Geneva). The polyclonal anti-NPC2 antibody has been described (14Blom T.S. Linder M.D. Snow K. Pihko H. Hess M.W. Jokitalo E. Veckman V. Syvänen A.C. Ikonen E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 257-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase H and peptide N-glycosidase F were from New England Biolabs. Poly-d-lysine, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, filipin, mevalonic acid lactone (mevalonate), and protease inhibitors were from Sigma. The G-5 supplement was from Invitrogen, and the characterized fetal bovine serum was from HyClone. Animals—Balb/c control mice were obtained from Harlan (Horst, The Netherlands). Balb/c mice heterozygous for the NPC1 mutation were provided by the Pentchev laboratory at the National Institutes of Health (15Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The mice were allowed food and water ad libitum and kept at a 12-h light-dark cycle, 22 °C temperature, and 50% relative air humidity. Mice heterozygous for the NPC1 mutation were used to generate the NPC1–/– embryos. The genotypes of individual embryos were determined from genomic DNA obtained from tissue samples using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotides as described (15Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Primary astrocyte cultures from E16.5 embryos were prepared and cultured essentially as described (16Aula N. Kopra O. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 15: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, astrocytes prepared from the striata of the embryos were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1× G-5 supplement, and 1% characterized fetal bovine serum on poly-d-lysine (50 μg/ml)-coated culture dishes (Nunc). The cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and 95% air for 7–12 days during which they were passaged 1–3 times before the experiments. At least 85% of the cells were astrocytes as judged by the percentage of anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells. Primary fibroblasts (F92–99) and their culture conditions have been described (17Hölttä-Vuori M. Määttä J. Ullrich O. Kuismanen E. Ikonen E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 95-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of Cells—The cells were seeded on 55-mm poly-d-lysine-coated culture dishes or 75-cm2 vessels in 1% characterized fetal bovine serum medium. The following day cells were washed a minimum of 6 times with PBS, and the growth medium was replaced with serum-free culture medium containing [14C]cholesterol (30–100 nCi/ml, 3 ml/dish). After 24–48 h of culture, the cells were washed with PBS, labeled with [3H]acetate (250–500 μCi/ml, 1.5 ml/dish) for 60 min at 37 °C, and chased at 37 °C for 2 or 18 h as indicated in serum-free culture medium in the presence of 10 μm lovastatin and 25 mm mevalonate. This labeling scheme is referred to as A. For equilibrium labeling, the cells were incubated with 1–2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol in culture medium for 2 days. The cells were then washed 6 times with PBS and seeded on 75-cm2 culture vessels in medium containing 1% (v/v) lipoprotein-deficient serum prepared as described (18Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) and 1–2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol. After 2 days of culture, the cells were washed several times with PBS and chased overnight in fresh, non-labeled serum-free culture medium, 7 ml/vessel. This labeling scheme is referred to as B. Identical treatment without the radiolabel is referred to as C. Analysis of Sterol Biosynthesis, Efflux, and Quantity—The medium and cells labeled as in A were collected, and aliquots of both were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting to determine the [14C]cholesterol activity. Lipids were extracted, separated by TLC, and analyzed by Ag+-HPLC and liquid scintillation counting as described (19Heino S. Lusa S. Somerharju P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. Ikonen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8375-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For quantitation of unlabeled sterols, the Ag+-HPLC eluent was passed through a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Series 200 UV-visible detector set at 210 nm. The instrument response was measured by comparing the peak areas of individual pure sterols (Steraloids). Flotation of Membranes in Sucrose Gradient—Flotation of cellular membranes in sucrose gradients was performed essentially as described (20Laitinen S. Lehto M. Lehtonen S. Hyvärinen K. Heino S. Lehtonen E. Ehnholm C. Ikonen E. Olkkonen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two confluent 75-cm2 flasks of astrocytes cultured as in C were washed twice with PBS and scraped in 250 mm sucrose, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and broken by repeated passages through a 23-gauge needle. After removal of nuclei and intact cells, sucrose was added to a final concentration of 2 m (total volume of 2 ml). This was overlaid with 1.6 ml of 1.7 m of sucrose and 0.4 ml of 0.8 m sucrose in 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The gradients were centrifuged at 37,000 × g in a SW60Ti rotor at 10 °C for 21 h. Fractions of 0.8 ml were collected from the top, and lipids were extracted from each fraction and analyzed by TLC and Ag+-HPLC. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Media from cells labeled as in A, B, or C and/or infected with recombinant Semliki Forest viruses as indicated were collected and centrifuged at +4 °C (2500 rpm, 10 min) to remove cellular debris. The media were then fractionated either after concentration by Centricon-10 filter units (Millipore) or unconcentrated using a Superose 6HR size-exclusion chromatography column (10 × 30, Amersham Biosciences). Medium (1 ml) was applied onto the column equilibrated with PBS. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The eluted fractions were analyzed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Where indicated, fractions were subjected to further analysis by TLC, HPLC, electron microscopy, or Western blotting as detailed elsewhere. Recombinant Semliki Forest Virus Expression—The NPC2 cDNA (14Blom T.S. Linder M.D. Snow K. Pihko H. Hess M.W. Jokitalo E. Veckman V. Syvänen A.C. Ikonen E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 257-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) cloned into the HindIII-EcoRV sites of pCR3.1 was excised as a HindIII-XbaI fragment, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and subcloned into the SmaI site of pSFV1. pSFV-LacZ, pSFV-NPC2, and pSFV-helper 1 were linearized, and runoff transcription was performed according to Liljeström and Garoff (21Liljeström P. Garoff H. Biotechnology (N Y). 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The NPC2 transcription mix was cotransfected with the helper transcription mix into baby hamster kidney cells using electroporation as described (22Olkkonen V.M. Liljeström P. Garoff H. Simons K. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The culture supernatant was collected after 24 h of incubation. Titration of the viral stocks on baby hamster kidney cells was performed as described (22Olkkonen V.M. Liljeström P. Garoff H. Simons K. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recombinant SFV was added on near-confluent dishes of astrocytes, and viral entry was allowed for 60 min at 37 °C, after which the incubation was continued in serum-free astrocyte medium at 37 °C for 6 or 14 h (latter for size-exclusion chromatography). Endoglycosidase Digestion and Western Blotting—For endoglycosidase digestion, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet-P40 in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin at 25 μg/ml each). Equal amounts (20 μg) of protein were incubated with endoglycosidase H or peptide N-glycosidase F according to manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblotting medium after size-exclusion chromatography, pooled fractions were dialyzed against water overnight using Spectra/Por dialysis membrane molecular weight cut-off 3500 (Spectrum Laboratories), lyophilized, and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. For analyzing NPC2 secretion, cells were changed to fresh serum-free medium (1 ml/dish), and cells and media were harvested after 6 h. Aliquots of media (0.69–1 ml/dish, amount adjusted for total protein, 113–163 μg/dish) were concentrated using Centricon YM-10 filter units (Millipore) and separated together with cell lysates (10 μg protein) by 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Hybond-C Extra membrane, blocked with 3% defatted bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and immunoblotted using anti-NPC2 antibodies (1:1000), horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. The specificity of the ∼22 kDa band for NPC2 was confirmed by analyzing NPC2–/– mouse tissue in which no immunoreactivity was found (data not shown). Densitometric scanning of the intensity of the NPC2 bands was performed with Advanced Image Data Analyzer (AIDA software). Immunofluorescence and Negative Staining Electron Microscopy— Filipin and antibody staining for immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described in Hölttä-Vuori et al. (23Hölttä-Vuori M. Tanhuanpää K. Möbius W. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3107-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) under “Immunocyto-chemistry.” The coverslips were viewed with a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope or an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with a Polychrome IV monochromator (TILL Photonics) with appropriate filters. For electron microscopy, medium from cells treated as in B was either stained as such or concentrated 14-fold with a Centricon-10 filter unit. The concentrated medium was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography, and material from pooled fractions 16–18 was stained. Fresh culture medium, similarly concentrated, was used as a control. Samples were adsorbed onto carbon-coated Pioloform grids and negatively stained with 2% potassium phosphotungstate, pH 7.2, before air drying. Grids were viewed using FEI Tecnai 12 electron microscope (Philips Electron Optics) at 80 kV. Spherical profiles were not found in fresh culture medium, and few profiles were observed in non-fractionated medium. For estimation of the particle diameter, pictures taken at a magnification of 49000 were scanned, and the diameter was measured with the use of the Image-Pro Plus software package, version 4.5.1.29. Measurements were done on 268 particles. Sterol Biosynthesis and Major Sterol Species in Astrocytes— Astrocytes in vivo are thought not to encounter serum lipoproteins, and their presence changes sterol balance in the cells. Both cholesterol biosynthesis and esterification are modulated by lipoproteins (24Volpe J.J. Hennessy S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 486: 408-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Shah S.N. Johnson R.C. Neurochem. Res. 1986; 11: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Because fully serum-free cultures did not efficiently survive and expand in vitro, the cells were cultured in the presence of 1% serum. Under these conditions, cell growth was slower than in the presence of 10–20% serum, but the cells divided and after 7–10 days displayed strong anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP) immunoreactivity (Fig. 1). The cells were labeled with [14C]cholesterol for 2 days and then pulse-labeled for 60 min with [3H]acetate followed by chasing for 2 or 18 h in the presence of lovastatin and mevalonate. [14C]Cholesterol labeling traces pre-existing cellular cholesterol pools, whereas newly synthesized sterols incorporate [3H]acetate. Lipids were extracted and separated by TLC followed by Ag+-HPLC to resolve individual sterol species. At 2 h of chase, desmosterol was the major biosynthetic [3H]sterol identified and was considerably more abundant than newly synthesized [3H]cholesterol. Cholesterol, zymosterol, and lathosterol represented minor radiolabeled sterol species (Fig. 2, a and c). After overnight chasing, the fraction of [3H]cholesterol increased, but unexpectedly, there was still a considerable fraction of [3H]desmosterol present (Fig. 2, b and c). These data suggest that the conversion of the immediate precursor of cholesterol to the end product was inefficient. We, therefore, analyzed the sterol composition of unlabeled astrocytes. The HPLC analysis revealed that desmosterol was roughly as abundant as cholesterol (cholesterol:desmosterol ratio = 1.00:1.18), whereas lathosterol and zymosterol represented minor sterol species in the cells (Fig. 2d). To rule out that the sterol composition was affected by the in vitro culture conditions, we analyzed the sterol profile in freshly prepared striata immediately after the dissociation of the cells. Also in this preparation, desmosterol was of similar abundance as cholesterol (data not shown). To study whether desmosterol is a constituent of astrocyte membranes, a membrane fraction was isolated by flotation in a sucrose gradient, and the ratio or cholesterol and desmosterol was compared. In the membranes with equilibrium density between 0.8 and 1.7 m sucrose, the cholesterol:desmosterol ratio was similar to that in the total cell extract. The result indicates that desmosterol is a major astrocyte membrane sterol, being roughly as abundant as cholesterol. Secretion of Sterols from Astrocytes—The amount of total [3H]-radiolabeled sterols in cells decreased upon chasing (Fig. 2c), suggesting that at least some of the sterols were secreted. We, therefore, analyzed the appearance of [3H]sterols in the culture medium at the same time points as in Fig. 2c, i.e. at 2 and 18 h of chase. Increasing amounts of all the biosynthetic sterols detected were recovered from the culture medium with increasing chase time (Fig. 3a). The efflux of lathosterol was most efficient, with more than 50% of the radiolabeled pool recovered from the medium after overnight chasing (Fig. 3b). The high efflux percentage is partially due to the low [3H]lathosterol levels in cells (see Fig. 2c). The efflux of [3H]desmosterol paralleled most closely with that of [3H]cholesterol, in line with previous results (12Lusa S. Heino S. Ikonen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19844-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To assess the size of the particles which the radiolabeled sterols associated with in the medium, the medium was analyzed by gel filtration on a Superose 6HR column. The radiolabeling protocol was the same as in Fig. 2, and the medium was collected after overnight chasing. The majority of the pre-labeled [14C]cholesterol was recovered in fractions 16–20 (Fig. 3c), and the bulk of the [3H]acetate-derived radioactivity appeared in fractions corresponding to or after the smallest standard (1350 Da). To resolve the [3H]acetate-derived sterols, pools of 5 fractions (16–20, 21–25, etc) were extracted, and lipids were analyzed by HPLC. We found that practically all of the [3H]acetate-derived sterols effluxed from cells were recovered from fractions 16–20 together with [14C]cholesterol (Fig. 3d). The cholesterol-containing fractions were then pooled, concentrated by using a Centricon-10 filter, and analyzed by negative staining electron microscopy. This revealed heterogeneous spherical particles (Fig. 4a) ranging in diameter from <15 nm to >30 nm, with an average diameter of 20 nm. The size distribution of the particles is given in Fig. 4a. HPLC analysis of the unlabeled sterol species in the culture medium showed that lathosterol, cholesterol, and desmosterol were the predominant sterols (Fig. 4b). The efficient efflux of lathosterol agrees with the result obtained by analyzing radiolabeled sterols. Together, the data suggest that sterol precursors lathosterol and desmosterol are major sterols in addition to cholesterol in the particles secreted by astrocytes. Sterol Synthesis and Secretion in NPC1–/–Astrocytes— Next, sterol synthesis and secretion in NPC1-deficient astrocytes was analyzed. These cells displayed prominent cholesterol accumulation in late endocytic organelles as visualized by the colocalization of bright, filipin-positive deposits with anti-LPBA immunoreactivity (Fig. 1c). Cells derived from wild-type, NPC1 heterozygous, and NPC1 null mice were pre-labeled with [14C]cholesterol for 2 days and pulse-labeled for 60 min with [3H]acetate followed by chasing for 18 h. We found that sterol biosynthesis was slightly but not significantly enhanced in NPC1 heterozygous and null astrocytes as compared with WT and that the sterol profile was similar between the three genotypes (Fig. 5a). The lack of increased cholesterol synthesis in NPC1-deficient astrocytes agrees with data obtained from NPC1-deficient sympathetic neurons (26Karten B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled sterols were then analyzed from the chase medium, and the fractions of individual sterols in cells and medium were compared. The percentage of sterols secreted to the medium was not significantly different between the three genotypes (Fig. 5b). To study the total sterols in NPC1–/– astrocytes, cells and medium from unlabeled cells were collected, and lipids were separated by TLC and Ag+-HPLC. The sterol profile in both the cells and medium was very similar to that observed for WT samples. Namely, cholesterol and desmosterol were the predominant sterol species in the cells (Fig. 5c; compare with Fig. 2d) and lathosterol, cholesterol and desmosterol in the medium (Fig. 5d; compare with Fig. 4b). The result confirms the efficient efflux of lathosterol seen with radiolabeled samples and shows that the total sterol profile in NPC1–/– cells is complex but not significantly different from WT. Secretion of Endogenous and Overexpressed NPC2 from Astrocytes—Lack of NPC2 function results in an NPC disease phenotype that in man is indistinguishable from lack of NPC1 function (6Patterson M.C. Neurologist. 2003; 9: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the NPC2 hypomorphic mouse closely resembles the NPC1 null mouse both with respect to disease progression and with biochemical and cellular neuropathological criteria (8Sleat D.E. Wiseman J.A. El-Banna M. Price S.M. Verot L. Shen M.M. Tint G.S. Vanier M.T. Walkley S.U. Lobel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5886-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). NPC2 was originally identified as the major secretory protein of the epididymis (27Kirchhoff C. Osterhoff C. Young L. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is known to bind cholesterol and can be secreted from cells as cholesterol bound (28Okamura N. Kiuchi S. Tamba M. Kashima T. Hiramoto S. Baba T. Dacheux F. Dacheux J.L. Sugita Y. Jin Y.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 29Ko D.C. Binkley J. Sidow A. Scott M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2518-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, of interest to analyze the secretion of NPC2 from normal and NPC1–/– astrocytes. Human NPC2 cDNA was expressed in astrocytes using the Semliki Forest virus expression system (21Liljeström P. Garoff H. Biotechnology (N Y). 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The endogenous murine NPC2 protein was visualized as a single band of ∼22 kDa by Western blotting (Fig. 6a). After removal of N-glycans the polypeptide chain migrated at ∼16 kDa. Most or all of the sugars were of high mannose type as indicated by the similar mobility of the protein after endoglycosidase H and F treatments (Fig. 6a). Human NPC2 migrated as a doublet slightly below 25 kDa as shown previously (30Naureckiene S. Sleat D.E. Lackland H. Fensom A. Vanier M.T. Wattiaux R. Jadot M. Lobel P. Science. 2000; 290: 2298-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) and contained both endoglycosidase H-sensitive and -resistant glycans (Fig. 6a). The slower mobility of human NPC2 was utilized to distinguish between the endogenous and overexpressed NPC2 in astrocytes (Fig. 6a). The secretion of endogenous and overexpressed NPC2 was studied by immunoblotting proteins from cells and concentrated medium without virus infection or after 6 h of infection with recombinant viruses. The endogenous levels of NPC2 were higher in NPC1–/– astrocytes as compared with WT (Fig. 6, b and c). The endogenous protein was secreted to the medium both from WT and NPC1–/– astrocytes, with the higher levels paralleled by efficient secretion from NPC1–/– cells (Fig. 6, b and c). The overexpressed NPC2 was also readily secreted from both cell types (Fig. 6b). When the relative amounts of the protein in the cells and medium were compared, the overexpressed NPC2 appeared to be secreted from the cells more effectively than the endogenous protein (Fig. 6b). This may be due at least partially to the saturation of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor targeting system upon overexpression. To determine if NPC2 was co-secreted with the cholesterol containing particles, astrocytes were equilibrium-labeled with [3H]cholesterol, infected with recombinant SFVs, and incubated overnight in the absence of radiolabel, and the medium was collected. The medium was fractionated as above, and the fractions were used for measuring [3H]cholesterol radioactivity and for trichloroacetic acid precipitation and immunoblotting with anti-NPC2 antibodies. The vast majority of cholesterol was again recovered from fractions 16–20 (Fig. 7a). Instead, endogenous NPC2 was precipita"
https://openalex.org/W2012298448,"The phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-sensitive inward rectifier channel Kir2.1 was expressed in Drosophila photoreceptors and used to monitor in vivo PIP2 levels. Since the wild-type (WT) Kir2.1 channel appeared to be saturated by the prevailing PIP2 concentration, we made a single amino acid substitution (R228Q), which reduced the effective affinity for PIP2 and yielded channels generating currents proportional to the PIP2 levels relevant for phototransduction. To isolate Kir2.1 currents, recordings were made from mutants lacking both classes of light-sensitive transient receptor potential channels (TRP and TRPL). Light resulted in the effective depletion of PIP2 by phospholipase C (PLC) in approximately three or four microvilli per absorbed photon at rates exceeding ∼150% of total microvillar phosphoinositides per second. PIP2 was resynthesized with a half-time of ∼50 s. When PIP2 resynthesis was prevented by depriving the cell of ATP, the Kir current spontaneously decayed at maximal rates representing a loss of ∼40% loss of total PIP2 per minute. This loss was attributed primarily to basal PLC activity, because it was greatly decreased in norpA mutants lacking PLC. We tried to confirm this by using the PLC inhibitor U73122; however, this was found to act as a novel inhibitor of the Kir2.1 channel. PIP2 levels were reduced ∼5-fold in the diacylglycerol kinase mutant (rdgA), but basal PLC activity was still pronounced, consistent with the suggestion that raised diacylglycerol levels are responsible for the constitutive TRP channel activity characteristic of this mutant. The phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-sensitive inward rectifier channel Kir2.1 was expressed in Drosophila photoreceptors and used to monitor in vivo PIP2 levels.

These are the prototypical members of the large and diverse family of “transient receptor potential” (TRP) channels many of which, including all of the most closely related “canonical” TRPC subfamily, are also regulated by PLC (reviewed in Refs. 1Clapham D.E.

Although in most cases the exact mechanism of TRP channel gating remains unresolved, mounting evidence, both in Drosophila and in at least a subset of mammalian TRP homologues, now suggests that diacylglycerol (DAG) rather than inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate (InsP3) is the critical product of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis (4Chyb S.

Because of its central role in phototransduction and PLC signaling generally, it is important to understand the dynamics of PIP2 turnover. In recent years a number of attempts have been made to monitor PIP2 levels in vivo, many making use of the GFP-tagged PIP2 binding PH domain from PLCδ (8Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While this has provided valuable insight into dynamic and spatial aspects of PIP2 mobilization, the PLCδ PH domain also binds InsP3 with high affinity, and it is not always clear whether PIP2 or InsP3 levels are being monitored (Ref. 9Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, but see also Ref. 10van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-based technologies are also of restricted value in photoreceptors, because the excitation light represents a saturating and usually damaging stimulus for the cell. Therefore we adopted an alternative approach by using an electrophysiological biosensor in the guise of the well characterized PIP2-sensitive ion channel, Kir2.1 (7Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Moore S. Juusola M. Baines R.A. Sweeney S.T. Neuron. 2001; 30: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Like all members of the inwardly rectifying Kir family, these channels require phosphoinositide binding for their activity, but Kir2.1 has the highest specificity for PIP2 showing, for example, no detectable activation by PI or phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and <5% activation by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (11Rohacs T.

Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In an initial study we expressed eGFP-tagged Kir2.1 channels in Drosophila photoreceptors under the control of the rhodopsin promoter and found them to be specifically targeted to the light-transducing microvillar membrane. In whole cell recordings from dissociated cells, the channels generated large constitutive currents, which could be rapidly and reversibly suppressed by light, representing PIP2 hydrolysis by PLC and its subsequent resynthesis (7Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Moore S. Juusola M. Baines R.A. Sweeney S.T. Neuron. 2001; 30: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).In the present study we have developed this technology further by expressing a mutant version of the Kir2.1 channel with reduced affinity for PIP2 with a dynamic range that more effectively covers the range of physiologically relevant PIP2 levels. We expressed the channels in several mutant backgrounds, including flies lacking the light-sensitive TRP and TRPL channels so that Kir2.1 currents could be recorded in isolation. Our results indicate that activated PLC can deplete PIP2 at rates well in excess of 100% s–1. In addition our data provide in vivo measurements of basal rates of PLC activity that, although they are orders of magnitude less than that of activated PLC, can still deplete all detectable PIP2 within minutes if PIP2 resynthesis is blocked. As well as providing unique quantitative information on the in vivo activity of PLC, the results also shed light on some recent studies concerning the mechanism of phototransduction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFlies—Drosophila melanogaster were raised in the dark at 25 °C. The eGFP-KiR2.1R228Q construct was generated from the wild-type (WT) eGFP-Kir2.1 construct previously described (7Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Moore S. Juusola M. Baines R.A. Sweeney S.T.

Following mutagenesis, the presence of the R228Q mutation and no other was confirmed by sequencing of the full gene. The eGFP-KiR2.1R228Q gene was then subcloned into pUAST and injected into yw embryos to obtain transformants as previously described (7Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Moore S. Juusola M. Baines R.A.

Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under control of the rhodopsin promoter (p[Rh1-Gal4] flies provided by J. Treismann and F. Pichaud). p[UAS Kir2.1], p[Rh1-Gal4] recombinants for both WT and R228Q Kir2.1 channels were generated on both second and third chromosomes to facilitate crossing into a variety of mutant backgrounds, including trp343, a null mutant of the dominant light-sensitive and Ca2+ permeable channel (15Niemeyer B.A. Suzuki E.

B. 1991; 245: 203-210Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and transferred to the bottom of a recording chamber on an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope. Unless otherwise stated, the bath was composed of (in mm): 110 NaCl, 10 KCl, 4 CsCl, 10 TES, 4 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 25 proline, and 5 alanine. The standard intracellular solution was (in mm): 140 potassium gluconate, 10 TES, 4 Mg-ATP, 2 MgCl2, 1 NAD, and 0.4 Na-GTP. In some experiments nucleotide additives (ATP, GTP, and NAD) were omitted and replaced with sucrose to maintain osmolarity. The pH of all solutions was 7.15. Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were made using electrodes of ∼10–15 MΩ resistance, and series resistance values were generally below 25 mΩ and were routinely compensated to >80%. Data were collected and analyzed using Axopatch 1-D or 200 amplifiers and pCLAMP 8 or 9 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Cells were stimulated via one of two green light-emitting diodes, with maximum effective intensity of ∼2 × 105 and 8 × 107 photons s–1 per photoreceptor, respectively. Relative intensities were calibrated using a linear photodiode and converted to absolute intensities in terms of effectively absorbed photons by counting quantum bumps at low intensities in WT flies (e.g. Ref. 20Henderson S.R. Reuss H. Hardie R.C. J. Physiol.-Lond. 2000; 524: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).With normal bath solutions, the constitutive currents generated by Kir2.1 channels were often very large (>5 nA), potentially leading to unacceptable series resistance errors. We therefore reduced the current amplitudes by recording in the presence of 4 mm Cs+, which partially blocks Kir2.1 channels. Furthermore, the block is voltage-dependent such that the current voltage (I-V) relationship reaches a maximum inward current at voltage of ∼–84 mV (Fig. 1). The current at this unique voltage can always be found by applying voltage ramps (typically from –100 to –40 mV) and determining the maximum current level, which will always occur at the same absolute voltage irrespective of any series resistance error. More usually, cells were unambiguously clamped at –84 mV using a manual offset voltage adjustment to find the maximum current, which was regularly checked throughout the recording.Estimating Resting PIP2 Levels—To compare PIP2 levels in different genetic backgrounds, dark-adapted Kir current levels were normalized to the background-subtracted GFP fluorescence measured from at least 10 randomly selected ommatidia from the same preparations using a microfluorimetry system (Photon Technology International) incorporating a photomultiplier, which measured the fluorescence above 510 nm induced by 485-nm excitation from a 75-watt xenon arc lamp.RESULTSThe Dynamic Range of Kir2.1R228Q Matches Endogenous PIP2 Levels—To track PIP2 levels in vivo we previously expressed the wild-type eGFP-tagged Kir2.1 channel (Kir2.1WT) in Drosophila photoreceptors under control of the rhodopsin (Rh1) promoter. The channels localize almost exclusively to the light-transducing microvilli, where they generate large constitutive inwardly rectifying currents, which can be suppressed by light as PIP2 is hydrolyzed by PLC, and recover in the dark as PIP2 is resynthesized. Most notably, when Ca2+ influx via TRP channels was prevented by blocking them with La3+, modest stimulation by light resulted in near complete suppression of Kir currents, indicating essentially total depletion of PIP2 as well as PI and PIP. This suggested that Ca2+ influx via TRP channels is normally required to inhibit PLC and/or facilitate PIP2 resynthesis (7Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Moore S. Juusola M. Baines R.A. Sweeney S.T. Neuron. 2001; 30: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We concluded that the resulting light-induced depletion of PIP2 in the trp mutant was the underlying cause of the long-debated trp (“transient receptor potential”) phenotype (21Cosens D.J. Manning A. Nature. 1969; 224: 285-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), whereby the response to maintained light in trp mutants decays to baseline, and thereafter the photoreceptors remain insensitive to further stimulation, recovering their sensitivity slowly in the dark as the PIP2 is resynthesized.The loss of PIP2 inferred from the suppression of the Kir current correlated in general with the loss of sensitivity of the light-induced current (LIC); however, there were significant quantitative discrepancies. In particular, suppression of the Kir current (representing PIP2 loss) required higher light intensities than the suppression of the LIC, whereas recovery of the Kir current was faster than the recovery of the light response, although both presumably reflect resynthesis of PIP2 as recovery of both was blocked in mutants of the PIP2 recycling pathway (7Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Moore S. Juusola M. Baines R.A. Sweeney S.T. Neuron. 2001; 30: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We attributed these differences to the known very high affinity of the Kir2.1 channel for PIP2 (22Zhang H.L. He C. Yan X.X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To confirm this and in an attempt to generate a more accurate probe for PIP2, we generated a point mutation (R228Q) in Kir2.1, which had previously been reported to substantially reduce the effective affinity of the channel for PIP2 (22Zhang H.L. He C. Yan X.X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We first confirmed a reduced effective affinity of ∼4-fold by expressing the channels in Drosophila S2 cells and measuring the dose response function to exogenously applied PIP2 in inside-out patches (Supplemental Fig. S1). We then expressed the channels in the photoreceptors and found that, like Kir2.1WT, the channels were also almost exclusively targeted to the microvillar membrane and mediated large inwardly rectifying K+ currents. After normalization for expression levels, the Kir currents in cells expressing Kir2.1R228Q channels were only 36% (±4% S.E., n = 27) of those expressing Kir2.1WT, suggesting that the endogenous PIP2 levels in the dark were only sufficient to partially activate Kir2.1R228Q. As will be described in more detail elsewhere, 2Y. Gu, M. Postma, G. Thomas, P. Raghu, and R. C. Hardie, manuscript in preparation. this was confirmed by showing that Kir2.1R228Q channel activity in the photoreceptors could be further increased at least 2-fold by application of exogenous PIP2 while Kir2.1WT channels seemed to be saturated (i.e. additional PIP2 did not significantly increase currents). Furthermore, like the WT channel (23Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), Kir2.1R228Q channels have a PIP2 dose response function with a Hill coefficient close to 1.0 (Supplemental Fig. S1); together with the low (<50%) level of activation, this means that the current should be approximately directly proportional to physiological PIP2 levels.We quantitatively compared the ability of calibrated light stimuli to suppress Kir currents on the one hand and to inactivate the LIC on the other. With Kir2.1WT channels, increasing intensities of light, delivered to cells in the presence of La3+ to block TRP channels, progressively suppressed both Kir current and the LIC; however, ∼9× higher intensities were required to suppress the Kir current (Fig. 2). By contrast, in flies expressing Kir2.1R228Q, suppression of sensitivity and Kir current were much more closely matched with only a 2.5-fold shift. A very similar behavior (2-fold shift) was also seen in trp mutants expressing Kir2.1R228Q and recorded in the absence of La3+.Fig. 2Comparison of Kir2.1WT and Kir 2.1R228Q channels. In the presence of La3+, a 5-s light stimulus (bar, ∼60,000 photons) resulted in a partial “trp decay” and an associated ∼70% suppression of the responses to dim test flashes (arrows). In a cell expressing Kir2.1WT (A) the Kir current was only suppressed by ∼10%; however, in a cell expressing Kir2.1R228Q (B), the Kir current was reduced by ∼50%. The upper dotted lines (zero current) represent the resting current after total suppression. The graphs (C and D) plot the intensity of the “depleting” stimulus versus normalized suppression of both Kir current (open symbols) and the response to test flashes (LIC: closed symbols) (mean ± S.E. n = 6–7 cells). For the Kir 2.1WT channel the fitted curves (Equation 1) indicate an 8.6-fold mismatch between sensitivity of the LIC and the Kir current to suppression, whereas with Kir2.1R228Q there is only a relative shift of ∼2.5-fold. Similar experiments using the trp mutant expressing Kir2.1R288Q in the absence of La3+ revealed a similar behavior (shift of 1.98; n = 5; data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We also compared the time courses of the recovery of Kir current (representing PIP2 resynthesis) and the LIC following stimuli inducing substantial PIP2 depletion (Fig. 3). Currents mediated by Kir2.1WT channels recovered relatively rapidly (t½ ∼ 30 s), but significant sensitivity to light only began to be restored after the Kir current had almost fully returned to pre-stimulation levels. By contrast, using Kir2.1R228Q the LIC and Kir current recovered over a similar time course (t½ ∼ 50 s). We also discovered that PIP2 synthesis could be routinely monitored at the start of any recording made in the presence of La3+ or the absence of Ca2+, because without Ca2+ influx via the TRP channels even the red light used for observation during electrode approach (equivalent to ∼200–400 effectively absorbed photons per second) was sufficient to significantly deplete PIP2. Consequently sensitivity was often very low immediately after establishing the whole cell configuration (break-in) but then increased over a period of 2–3 min in the dark. Similarly, the Kir current was typically relatively small at first but then increased over a similar time course, starting as soon as (but not before) the red light was turned off. In cells expressing Kir2.1WT channels there was only a modest (28 ± 7%, n = 7; mean ± S.E.) increase in Kir current, which was not well correlated with the increase in sensitivity to light. However, over the same experimental time period in cells expressing Kir2.1R228Q the current typically increased over 3-fold (369 ± 38%, n = 34) over the first ∼3 min in the dark and, when measured, closely paralleled a similar increase in the sensitivity to light (Fig. 3C). A similar “run-up” behavior was first described over ten years ago in recordings made in Ca2+ free Ringer (24Hardie R.C. Minke B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 643-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 25Hardie R.C. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1995; 177: 707-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but at that time it was speculated that it might represent refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores.Fig. 3PIP2 resynthesis time courses. Following a flash (bar) that induced ∼50–75% depletion (recorded in WT flies in the presence of 20 μm La3+) the Kir2.1WT current (A) recovered with a t½ of ∼30 s, whereas Kir2.1R228Q recovery (B) was slower. The simultaneously recorded responses to brief test flashes (vertical deflections) recovered with similar time course in cells expressing Kir2.1R228Q, but the Kir2.1WT current almost completely recovered before significant recovery of the light response (note the initial phase of resynthesis in B is masked by the slow component of the Kir2.1 response to PIP2 depletion). C, the increase of sensitivity to light flashes and Kir2.1R228Q current recorded during “run up” shortly after establishing the whole cell recording configuration (time after w-c) were closely matched. Dotted lines represent zero current (i.e. after complete suppression of Kir current). Normalized time courses of Kir current recovery (solid symbols) and light response (open symbols) are shown on the accompanying graphs. D, half times (t½) for 50% recovery of the light response (LIC), Kir2.1WT and Kir2.1R228Q currents following 50–75% suppression by PIP2 “depleting” stimuli in the presence of 20–40 μm La3+ and (for Kir2.1R228Q only) also following a maximum intensity stimulus under “physiological” conditions in the absence of La3+ (see also Fig. 4) (mean ± S.E., n = 7–11 cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In summary, the activity of Kir2.1R228Q channels shows a close quantitative correlation with the sensitivity to light over a range of PIP2 levels, and the channels' operating range thus appears to effectively cover the PIP2 levels relevant to phototransduction. Although Kir2.1WT channels are more sensitive to low levels of PIP2, e.g. during the initial period of PIP2 resynthesis following depletion, they seem to be largely saturated by the dark-adapted resting level of PIP2. We also note that the large differences in sensitivity to suppression by light and the time course of the subsequent recovery, following a point mutation in Kir2.1 known to reduce its effective affinity for PIP2, represent strong additional confirmation that Kir2.1 channels are directly monitoring PIP2 levels under these conditions.Light-induced PLC Activity—We previously found that, under control “physiological” conditions with both TRP and TRPL function intact, even very bright stimuli only suppressed the Kir2.1WT current by ∼20%. It could also not be excluded that even this modest suppression might have represented modulation by the large light-induced ion fluxes (which include Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) rather than PIP2 depletion. We therefore repeated these experiments using flies expressing Kir2.1R228Q, reasoning that if PIP2 levels were in fact reduced under these conditions, there should now be substantially more suppression of the Kir current. Indeed, the Kir2.1R228Q channels were significantly more sensitive to suppression by light; nevertheless, even the brightest stimuli tested (∼106 photons, roughly equivalent to full daylight intensities) failed to suppress more than ∼40% of the current (Fig. 4). The currents then recovered with the typical time course seen in the presence of La3+ (t½ ∼ 50 s: Figs. 3D and 4B). These results indicate that there is indeed a significant, though not debilitating loss of PIP2 during light adaptation under physiological conditions.Fig. 4Depletion of PIP2 under “physiological” conditions.A, the current mediated by Kir2.1WT channels expressed on a WT background and recorded without La3+ was maximally suppressed by only ∼10–20% with stimuli approximating full daylight intensities (∼106 photons delivered with a 5-s stimulus). B, by contrast Kir2.1R228Q channels were suppressed by ∼40% (shown on a longer time scale in the inset below). Vertical deflections (B only) are responses to brief test flashes. C, response intensity function for Kir suppression using either Kir2.1WT or Kir2.1R228Q channels. Also shown are data from Kir2.1R228Q channels expressed in the trp mutant and recorded without La3+ (n = 4–12 cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In experiments described thus far, the Kir current was simultaneously recorded with the LIC. Although this approximates physiological conditions, it compromises accurate measurement of the Kir current, because it cannot be cleanly separated from the LIC and because the Kir current may be indirectly influenced by ion fluxes associated with the LIC. To isolate the Kir current we expressed and recorded from Kir2.1 channels in trp;trpl double mutants or in trpl mutants in the presence of La3+. In either case this results in total elimination of all native light-sensitive currents (15Niemeyer B.A. Suzuki E. Scott K. Jalink K. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1996; 85: 651-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 26Reuss H. Mojet M.H. Chyb S. Hardie R.C. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1249-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and the electrophysiological response to light now consisted solely of a suppression of the constitutive Kir current uncontaminated by any other conductance. Suppression and recovery of the Kir current should thus now provide basic quantitative information on rates of PIP2 hydrolysis and synthesis in the absence of feedback by Ca2+. Both the overall suppression and the rate of suppression increased with brief flashes of increasing intensity (Fig. 5). In terms of the overall suppression reached, the data could be reasonably well fitted by a simple equation that assumes that each absorbed photon effectively depletes a number (n) of microvilli of their PIP2; namely in Equation 1 (see Ref. 7Hardie R.C.

https://openalex.org/W2137118243,"The c-myc mRNA coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) was first identified as a masking protein that stabilizes c-myc mRNA in a cell-free mRNA degradation system. Thus, CRD-BP is thought to promote cell proliferation by maintaining c-Myc at critical levels. CRD-BP also appears to be an oncofetal protein, based upon its expression during mammalian development and in some tumors. By using K562 leukemia cells as a model, we show that CRD-BP gene silencing by RNA interference significantly promoted proliferation, indicating an inhibitory effect of CRD-BP on proliferation. Unexpectedly, CRD-BP knockdown had no discernible effect on c-myc mRNA levels. CRD-BP is also known as insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) mRNA-binding protein-1. It has been reported to repress translation of a luciferase reporter mRNA containing an IGF-II 5′-untranslated region known as leader 3 but not one containing IGF-II leader 4. CRD-BP knockdown markedly increased IGF-II mRNA and protein levels but did not alter translation of luciferase reporter mRNAs containing 5′-untranslated regions consisting of either IGF-II leader 3 or leader 4. Addition of antibody against IGF-II to cell cultures inhibited the proliferative effect of CRD-BP knockdown, suggesting that regulation of IGF-II gene expression, rather than c-myc mRNA levels, mediates the proliferative effect of CRD-BP knockdown. Thus, we have identified a dominant function for CRD-BP in cell proliferation of human K562 cells, involving a possible IGF-II-dependent mechanism that appears independent of its ability to serve as a c-myc mRNA masking protein.

Post-transcriptional regulation of the c-myc proto-oncogene affects the levels and timing of c-Myc protein expression in mammalian cells.

The c-myc mRNA coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) was first identified by its ability to mask c-myc mRNA from a polyribosome-associated endoribonuclease in a cell-free mRNA decay system (13Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, its function was postulated to maintain c-Myc expression at levels required to promote cell proliferation. CRD-BP is expressed in fetal and neonatal mammals and in some tumors. By comparison, its expression is reduced or absent in normal adult tissues (14Ioannidis P. Trangas T. Dimitriadis E. Samiotaki M. Kyriazoglou I. Tsiapalis C.M. Kittas C. Agnantis N. Nielsen F.C.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CRD-BP expression in mammary epithelial cells of adult transgenic mice induced mammary tumors (18Tessier C.R. Doyle G.A. Clark B.A. Pitot H.C. Ross J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, it is presumed to be an oncofetal protein. CRD-BP was later shown to be identical to IMP-1 (14Ioannidis P. Trangas T. Dimitriadis E. Samiotaki M. Kyriazoglou I. Tsiapalis C.M. Kittas C. Agnantis N. Nielsen F.C. Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Pandis N. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). CRD-BP/IMP-1 is highly related to IMP-2 and IMP-3, which together comprise a family of proteins that bind to the 5′-untranslated region of IGF-II leader 3 mRNA. As such, CRD-BP/IMP-1 can repress translation of an IGF-II-luciferase reporter mRNA without affecting levels of the reporter mRNA, and it may repress translation of IGF-II leader 3 mRNA during development (19Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). This property implies an inhibitory action for CRD-BP in cell proliferation. However, IMP-1 knockout mice are dwarfs, and their embryonic fibroblasts have a slower proliferation rate (20Hansen T.V. Hammer N.A. Nielsen J. Madsen M. Dalbaeck C. Wewer U.M. Christiansen J. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4448-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This implies that CRD-BP can have a positive effect upon cell proliferation. Thus, based upon its proposed control of c-Myc and IGF-II levels, CRD-BP would appear to exert opposing effects on cell proliferation. Therefore, to explore post-transcriptional roles and mechanisms for CRD-BP in gene expression and cell proliferation, experiments were designed to knockdown its expression by using short interfering RNA (siRNA). siRNA can induce sequence-specific gene silencing by promoting degradation of the homologous mRNA in organisms ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans (21Fire A.

This effect, known as RNAi, has become a powerful genetic tool for studying gene function in higher organisms. Here RNAi was employed to silence CRD-BP expression in K562 cells, which were utilized for the original identification of CRD-BP (13Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). K562 is a pluripotent, human leukemia cell line possessing erythroid and myeloid properties (31Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, CRD-BP knockdown up-regulated IGF-II mRNA and protein levels, had no effect on c-myc mRNA levels, and promoted cell proliferation via a possible IGF-II-dependent pathway. siRNA Duplex Preparation—The CRD-BP/IMP-1 SMARTpool and single siRNA duplexes were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, Co). The SMARTpool siRNA is a mixture of four different siRNA duplexes targeting human CRD-BP/IMP-1 (GenBank™ accession number AF117106). The sequences of the SMARTpool siRNA are proprietary. The single siRNA sequence corresponded to the coding region 709–729 nucleotides after the start codon (5′-aag gag aac gca ggu gca gcu-3′). The negative control siRNA consisted of the same nucleotides randomly arranged (5′-aac ugg gua agc ggg cgc aaa-3′). siRNA duplexes contained dTdT 3′-overhangs. siRNA sequences were subjected to a BLAST search against human genome sequences in GenBank™ to ensure specificity. siRNA duplexes were dissolved in 1× universal RNA oligo buffer (20 mm KCl, 6 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm MgCl2). Cell Culture and siRNA Transfection—Human K562 leukemia cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 5 × 106 cells were transfected with either 200 nm of SMARTpool, single CRD-BP, or negative control siRNA duplexes or an equal volume of 1× universal oligo buffer (mock control) by electroporation using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Electroporation parameters were 0.28 kV and 1050 microfarads. Cells were maintained for the times indicated in the figure legends. Specific RNA interference effects were confirmed by at least three independent experiments. Western Blot Analyses—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from K562 cells using the CelLytic NuCLEAR™ extraction kit (Sigma). Total protein in extracts was quantified by the Bradford assay by using the Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For antibody preparation, one CRD-BP/IMP-1-specific peptide (PENGRRGGFGSRGQPRQG, residues 163–180), IMP-2-specific peptide (SPSPPQRAQRGD, residues 161–172), and IMP-3-specific peptide (TSGMPPPTSGPPS, residues 379–391) were synthesized with an N-terminal cysteine (CyberSyn, Lenni, PA), coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA). Antisera were subjected to affinity purification by using the respective immunizing peptides immobilized on Sulfolink coupling gel (Pierce), elution with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and immediate neutralization with Tris base. Other antibody sources and dilutions were as follows: IGF-II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1:500, c-Myc (Oncogene) 1:300, α-tubulin (Sigma) 1:10,000, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A/B/C 1:30 (undiluted hybridoma supernatant) (32Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The dilution for all of the IMP antibodies was 1:5,000. The secondary antibody dilutions and sources were as follows: goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Promega) 1:2,500, and goat anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) 1:3,000. For Western blot analyses, 50 μg of protein extract for each sample was fractionated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (Fisher). Standard Western blotting assay was performed using SuperSignal® West chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. α-Tubulin and hnRNP A/B/C proteins served as the loading control for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions, respectively. The relevant bands were scanned and quantified using a DC120 Zoom digital camera and Kodak Digital Science 1D software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Expression and Purification of Recombinant CRD-BP Protein—Native human recombinant CRD-BP protein was purified with the IMPACT kit (New England Biolabs) by using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (ISCO) following the manufacturer's instructions. The pCYB1-CRD-BP expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. Jan Christiansen (19Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The complete coding sequence of CRD-BP was inserted into an NdeI + SapI-cleaved pCYB1 expression vector. CRD-BP was expressed by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction in Escherichia coli BL21/DE3 cells transformed with pRI952 and a pCYB1/CRD-BP plasmid. pRI952 promotes translation of open reading frames containing rare isoleucine and arginine codons by overexpressing the ileA and argU tRNAs (19Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Human CRD-BP was then purified by using the IMPACT system and confirmed by Western blot analysis as described above. RNase Protection Assay—c-myc and γ-globin mRNA levels were examined by RNase protection assay in a single tube format as described previously (1Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33336-33345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The c-myc antisense probe yields multiple protected fragments corresponding to mRNA molecules with closely spaced polyadenylation sites (1Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33336-33345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). γ-Globin mRNA served as the internal control. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—H19 RNA and IGF-II, c-myc, CRD-BP, β-actin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels were examined by quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). One-step qRT-PCR was performed using an MX-4000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR primers and probes were designed using web-based Primer-3 software (www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi) and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). They are as follows: c-myc probe, 5′-6-FAM-CGG GCA CTT TGC ACT GGA ACT TAC A-TAMRA-3′, c-myc forward primer, 5′-ACG AAA CTT TGC CCA TAG CA-3′, and c-myc reverse primer, 5′-GCA AGG AGA GCC TTT CAG AG-3′; IGF-II probe, 5′-6-FAM-TGG ACA CCC TCC AGT TCG TCT GTG-TAMRA-3′, IGF-II forward primer, 5′-AAG TCG ATG CTG GTG CTT CT-3′, and IGF-II reverse primer, 5′-CGG AAA CAG CAC TCC TCA A-3′; CRD-BP probe, 5′-Cy5-GTT GCA GGG CCG AGC AGG AA-BHQ-3′, CRD-BP forward primer, 5′-AAC CCT GAG AGG ACC ATC ACT-3′, and CRD-BP reverse primer: 5′-AGC TGG GAA AAG ACC TAC AGC-3′; H19 probe, 5′-6-FAM-CCT GAC TCA GGA ATC GGC TCT GGA-TAMRA-3′, H19 forward primer, 5′-ATG GTG CTA CCC AGC TCA AG-3′, and H19 reverse primer, 5′-TGT TCC GAT GGT GTC TTT GA-3′; β-actin probe, 5′-FAM-TTG GAG CGA GCA TCC CCC A-3′, β-actin forward primer, 5′-ACT GGA ACG GTG AAG GTG AC-3′, and β-actin reverse primer, 5′-AGA GAA GTG GGG TGG CTT TT-3′; and GAPDH probe, 5′-JOE NHS-TCA AGG CTG AGA ACG GGA AGC TTG-TAMRA-3′, GAPDH forward primer, 5′-GAG TCA ACG GAT TTG GTC GT-3′, and GAPDH reverse primer, 5′-GAT CTC GCT CCT GGA AGA TG-3′. GAPDH was used as an internal quantitative control in the same tube (2-multiplex PCR). Cycler conditions for qRT-PCR are as follows: 50 °C, 30 min; and 95 °C, 15 min (94 °C, 20s, and 60 °C, 1 min) × 50 cycles. Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Each sample was run in triplicate. The experiment was performed three times. The data were analyzed using the included MX 4000 software. Whole Cell mRNA Decay Assay—Exponentially dividing K562 cells were cultured with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) or 30 μg/ml 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (Sigma) for various times at 37 °C to inhibit transcription. Cells were harvested at each time point, and total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). IGF-II, GAPDH, and c-myc mRNA levels were assayed by qRT-PCR as described above. c-myc was used as a positive control, because it decays with rapid kinetics following inhibition of transcription (33Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1996-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). GAPDH served as an internal control. ELISA Analysis—IGF-II concentrations in culture media of K562 cells were detected with an enzymatically amplified two-step, sandwich-type immunoassay using the Non-Extraction IGF-II ELISA kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, media samples were pretreated with buffers provided in the kit to dissociate IGF-II- and IGF-binding proteins prior to the assay. This eliminates the IGF-II-binding proteins from interfering with the ELISA. Samples of standards, controls, and pretreated growth medium were then incubated in microtitration wells pre-coated with anti-human IGF-II antibody, followed by treatment with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG, development using the substrate tetramethylbenzidine, and stopped by sulfuric acid. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a reference of 620 nm using a Multiskanplus ELISA reader (LAB System). The absorbance measured is directly proportional to the concentration of IGF-II present. A standard curve was prepared, and the sample IGF-II concentration was calculated using Prism software (version 2.0, Graph Pad software). Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay and MTS Assay—Cell counts were obtained by standard trypan blue (Sigma) exclusion according to the manufacturer's protocol. MTS assay was performed using the CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega). Twenty microliters of CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution reagent (MTS tetrazolium compound) was added to each well of a 96-well culture plate containing K562 cells in 100 μl of culture medium. The plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured using an SLT Rainbow ELISA Reader (Tecan). The 490 nm absorbance was directly proportional to the number of viable cells in the culture (34Cory A.H. Owen T.C. Barltrop J.A. Cory J.G. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay—The plasmids pcDNA-IGF-II-L3-Luc and pcDNA-IGF-II-L4-Luc contain the firefly luciferase coding region inserted between the EcoRI and XbaI sites in the pcDNA3.1 basic vector (Invitrogen) and the complete leader 3 (1,164 bp) or leader 4 (94 bp) exon, respectively, in the HindIII site between the cytomegalovirus promoter and the luciferase coding region. These two constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Jan Christiansen (19Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Ten million K562 cells in exponential growth were co-transfected with 1 μg of pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase control vector (Promega) and 10 μg of either pcDNA-IGF-II-L3-Luc or pcDNA-IGF-II-L4-Luc, and 200 nm CRD-BP siRNA. pRL-SV40 served as an internal control. After 48 h, luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) on a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). In some experiments, the reporter constructs were replaced by pcDNA3.1 to check background luminescence levels for firefly luciferase activity. These were negligible. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity in the same cell extract and is thus expressed as a ratio of firefly/Renilla luciferase activity. Neutralization of IGF-II in Cell Culture Medium—K562 cells were transfected with negative control and CRD-BP siRNA duplex, respectively, as described above, and seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. To neutralize the IGF-II secreted into the growth medium by K562 cells, a polyclonal rabbit antibody against human IGF-II (200 μg IgG/ml in PBS, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to cell cultures twice at concentrations of 2, 4, or 8 μg/ml at 0 and 24 h after transfection. 8 μg/ml nonimmune rabbit IgG (Sigma) and 40 μl/ml PBS buffer were used as negative controls. Cultures were maintained for 48 h post-transfection. The number of viable cells in each culture was determined by MTS assay as described earlier. Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test and analysis of variance followed by Scheffé test, if a significant F ratio was obtained. The data were expressed as means ± S.E. A p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. CRD-BP siRNA Specifically Inhibits CRD-BP Gene Expression—The effects of CRD-BP siRNA on CRD-BP levels were examined over a 4-day period. We transfected either a SMARTpool or an individual siRNA duplex targeted to human CRD-BP into human K562 leukemia cells by electroporation, as well as a negative control siRNA, which includes the nucleotides randomly rearranged. An equal volume of 1× universal RNA oligo buffer was used as a mock control. Western blotting analyses were performed to monitor protein levels. Cytoplasmic CRD-BP levels were reduced 40% at 24 h (p < 0.05) and reduced 92% at 48h(p < 0.01) compared with the control siRNA (Fig. 1, A and B). The effect began to subside at 72 h (55% reduction, p < 0.01), and expression returned to control levels by 96 h (Fig. 1, A and B). These results indicated that the effect of CRD-BP RNAi is time-dependent. CRD-BP/IMP-1, IMP-2, and IMP-3 belong to a family of IGF-II mRNA-binding proteins (IMPs) with an overall sequence identity of 59% (19Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Lykke-Andersen J. Johnsen A.H. Wewer U.M. Nielsen F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). IMP-3 expression exhibited no statistically significant change after CRD-BP/IMP-1 RNA interference (Fig. 1, A and B, and Fig. 2, A and B), demonstrating specificity of silencing. IMP-2 expression was undetectable by Western blotting analysis (data not shown). Nuclear levels of CRD-BP displayed kinetics similar to cytoplasmic CRD-BP (Fig. 1, C and D). The negative control siRNA duplex treatment did not alter CRD-BP expression levels in either the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, A and B) or nucleus (not shown) compared with the mock control treatment (p > 0.05). CRD-BP siRNA had similar inhibitory effects on CRD-BP mRNA levels as assessed by qRT-PCR (data not shown). This suggests that the siRNA promoted mRNA degradation. Similar effects were obtained by utilizing several CRD-BP siRNAs in a SMARTpool (see “Experimental Procedures”). This control served to minimize the possibility that the effects of the single siRNA for CRD-BP were because of off-target gene knockdown (35Scacheri P.C. Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Caplen N.J.

Transfection of a green fluorescent protein construct using the same electroporation conditions as those used for siRNAs revealed that transfection efficiencies were >90% (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that our procedures promote efficient and specific CRD-BP gene silencing.Fig. 2High efficiency and specificity of CRD-BP RNA interference in human leukemia cells. A, K562 cells were transfected with CRD-BP siRNA, negative control siRNA, or 1× universal oligo buffer (mock control), respectively. In Western blot analyses, α-tubulin served as the loading control for total cytoplasmic protein. CRD-BP siRNA duplex specifically inhibited expression of CRD-BP protein by about 92% compared with the control siRNA and mock control treatment at 48 h post-transfection by Western blotting analysis.

CRD-BP knockdown did not affect c-myc mRNA levels in the cytoplasm when compared with the negative control siRNA treatment over the 4-day period (p > 0.05; Fig. 1, E and F). These results were confirmed by qRT-PCR (data not shown). This result was unexpected because CRD-BP is thought to stabilize c-myc mRNA (13Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J.

To assess the effects of CRD-BP knockdown on c-Myc protein levels, Western blot analyses were performed using extracts prepared during the 4-day time course of siRNA treatment. Cytoplasmic levels of c-Myc exhibited no statistically significant change (Fig. 1, A and B). Cytoplasmic c-Myc likely represented protein synthesized but not yet transported to the nucleus. By contrast, CRD-BP gene silencing appeared to modestly alter nuclear c-Myc levels in a biphasic manner. Compared with the control siRNA, the CRD-BP siRNA led to increased c-Myc levels by 60% (p < 0.01) at 24 h in the early phase but led to decreased levels by 55% at 72 h (p < 0.01) in the later phase (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, CRD-BP gene silencing might alter nuclear levels of c-Myc, but this effect appears minimal (see “Discussion”). CRD-BP Gene Silencing Promotes Cell Prolifer"

Although Soh1/MED31 orthologues are encoded by the S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe genomes, these proteins have not been identified as Mediator components.

We here report the identification of Soh1 and its orthologue Sep10 (here denoted spSoh1/MED31) as bona fide members of the S. cerevisiae and S. pombe Mediator complex. A thorough study of predicted Soh1/MED31 orthologues from a wide range of eukaryotic species revealed a highly conserved 69-amino acid motif. We used sequence analysis to trace the Soh1/MED31 family of Mediator subunits to the point of major eukaryotic divergence, before the appearance of the canonical heptapeptide repeat structure of the RNAP II C-terminal domain (CTD). Plasmid Construction—We generated the pFA6-2xFLAG-kanMX6 plasmid by introducing a double-stranded oligonucleotide linker (5′-CTC GAG ACT ATA AGG ATG ACG ATG ACA AGA TCG ACT ATA AGG ATG ACG ATG ACA AGT AGG GCC-3′; 5′-CGC GGG CCC TAC TTG TCA TCG TCA TCC TTA TAG TCG ATC TTG TCA TCG TCA TCC TTA TAG TCT CGA GAT-3′) between the AscI and PacI sites of pFA6a-GST-kanMX6, replacing the glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag with a tandem FLAG tag (18Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar). We PCR-amplified the 3′-flanking region of SOH1 (forward primer, 5′-GCG CGC GAG CTC ACA CAC CTA ATT ATA ACT-3′; reverse, 5′-GCG CGC GAT ATC AGC TGC ATT GGT GAG GAT ATT-3′), and inserted the resulting DNA fragment between EcoRV and SacI of pFA6-2xFLAG-kanMX6, to generate pFA6-2xFLAG-dsSOH1. To construct pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1wt, pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1Δ1, pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1Δ2, and pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1Δ5, we PCR-amplified the coding region of SOH1 (or truncated versions thereof). We used primers 1 (forward, (5′-GCG CGC GGA TCC CCT CAA GCA CTA ATG GAA AC-3′) and 2 (reverse, (5′-GCG CGC CTC GAG AGT TGG CCC ATC TTT CTA C-3′) for SOH1wt; primers 3 (forward, (5′-CGC GCG GAT CCA GCT GAT GTC AAG CAC TAA TGG A-3′) and 4 (reverse, (5′-CGC GCG CTC GAG ACT GTT GAG TGA GTA AGT A-3′) for SOH1Δ1; and primers 3 (forward) and 6 (reverse, (5′-CGC GCG CTC GAG ACA TGA ACC CGT TCA ACA G-3′) for SOH1Δ2. The DNA fragments were inserted between the BamHI and XhoI sites of pFA6-2xFLAG-dsSOH1 to generate pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1wt, pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1Δ1, and pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1Δ2. The pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1Δ3, pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1Δ4, and pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1Δ5 constructs were made from two individual DNA fragments. We first PCR-amplified parts of the SOH1 coding region using primers 7 (forward, (5′-GCG CGG ATC CTA GAA TTC ATG TTG AAC GGG TTC ATG GAG-3′) and 2 (reverse) for SOH1Δ3; primers 8 (forward, (5′-GCG CGG ATC CTA GAA TTC ATG AGG TTC GAA GTG GAG CTC-3′) and 6 (reverse) for SOH1Δ4; and primers 8 (forward) and 2 (reverse) for SOH1Δ5. We next inserted the resulting DNA fragments between the BamHI and XhoI sites of pFA6-2xFLAG-dsSOH1. Finally, we PCR-amplified the 5′-flanking region of SOH1 using primers 9 (forward, (5′-GCG CGG ATC CAG CTG TCA GTA TGG CAT ACC-3′) and 10 (reverse, (5′-ATA TGA ATT CCT GGG TGG AGC TTG GGG-3′) and introduced the resulting DNA fragment between BamHI and EcoRI to generate the final pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1Δ3, pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1Δ4, and pFA6-2xFLAG-SOH1Δ5 constructs.

For preparation of whole cell extract, we collected yeast cells from a 15-liter culture by centrifugation (JLA-10,500 rotor (Beckman Instruments), 9,500 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), which were washed once with ice-cold water and suspended in 0.5 ml of 3× lysis buffer (200 mm KOH-Hepes, pH 7.8, 15 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) per gram of cell pellet. For all purifications, we used a 100× stock of protease inhibitors containing 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 mm pepstatin, 60 mm leupeptin, and 200 mm benzamidine in 99.5% ethanol. Cells were lysed by bead beating (Bead-Beater, Stratech, London, UK) for 25 cycles, with each cycle consisting of 30 s of beating and 90 s of rest. We cleared the supernatant by centrifugation (JLA-10,500 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 9,500 rpm, for 10 min, at 4 °C), added 1/9 vol of 2 m KCl, and stirred for 15 min. Polyethyleneimine was added to a final concentration of 0.02% followed by 15 min of stirring. Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation (Ti45 rotor (Beckman Instruments), 42,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). We purified Mediator according to the original TAP tag purification protocol (22Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. We added 900 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) to 200 ml of extract and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The IgG-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation (JA-17 rotor (Beckman Instruments), 800 rpm, 1 min, 4 °C), loaded onto a Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad), and washed with 100 ml of IgG wash buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). We eluted the Mediator in two steps: first, by incubation for 2 h at 16 °C with 200 units of tobacco etch virus (TEV) NIa protease (Invitrogen) in 2 ml of TEV buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mm dithiothreitol), which we designated IgG eluate 1, and second, by elution of the IgG-Sepharose by incubation with 8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, for 5 min at room temperature, which we called IgG eluate 2. For further purification of S. pombe Mediator, we loaded 500 μl of IgG eluate 1 onto a 1-ml heparin HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A-0.1 (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, and the molarity of sodium chloride indicated after the hyphen) and then developed with a linear gradient (12 ml) of A-0.1 to A-1.2. We purified S. cerevisiae Mediator further by loading 750 μl of IgG eluate 1 onto a 1-ml SP-Sepharose HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A-0.1 and developed with a linear gradient (12 ml) of A-0.1 to A-1.2. Immunoblotting and Production of Antibodies—Recombinant spSoh1/MED31 protein fused to GST was overproduced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Stratagene) and subsequently purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier's recommendations.

We therefore decided to directly investigate the presence of Soh1/MED31 in the S. cerevisiae Mediator. We used a yeast strain with a TAP tag fused in-frame with the Med8 Mediator subunit and introduced a tandem FLAG tag at the C terminus of the Soh1/MED31 protein (f:Soh1/MED31). We purified TAP-Med8 Mediator over IgG-Sepharose and observed co-purification of f:Soh1/MED31 with known Mediator subunits (Fig. 1A). We purified Mediator further over SP-Sepharose and observed perfect co-migration of f:Soh1/MED31 with Mediator subunit Med1 (Fig. 1B). We therefore concluded that Soh1/MED31 is a subunit of the S. cerevisiae Mediator complex. spSoh1/MED31 Is a Member of the S. pombe Mediator—To investigate whether the spSoh1/MED31 protein is a subunit of S. pombe Mediator, we raised a polyclonal antibody against full-length protein in recombinant form. S. pombe Mediator with a C-terminal TAP tag in-frame with the med7+ gene was purified over IgG-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose. We used immunoblot analysis and observed perfect co-purification of spSoh1/MED31 with previously characterized Mediator subunits Pmc3/MED27 and spSrb4/MED17 (Fig. 2). We separated purified S. pombe Mediator on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass fingerprinting to reanalyze the 15–20 kDa molecular mass range, which contains many previously characterized subunits, e.g. spRox3/MED19. spNut2/MED10, spSrb6/MED22, and spSrb7/MED21. We found one peptide peak at 1246.65 Da, closely corresponding to the predicted value of 1246.63 Da for amino acid residues 80–89 of the 16.8 kDa spSoh1/MED31 protein (data not shown). We concluded that spSoh1/MED31 is a subunit of the S. pombe Mediator. The SOH1 Family of Proteins Is Highly Conserved among Eukaryotes—All Mediator complexes purified to date are from fungi and metazoa, which are close relatives on the eukaryotic tree (30Baldauf S.L. Palmer J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11558-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We wanted to expand previous analysis of the Soh1/MED31 family by using sequences from a wide array of eukaryotes with an even spread of sequence diversity (17Szilagyi Z. Grallert A. Nemeth N. Sipiczki M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 268: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Using BLAST software searches against protein, genomic, and expressed sequence tag sequences, we detected highly probable Soh1/MED31 orthologues in other branches of the eukaryotic tree, including green plants and several protistan phyla. We selected sequences for further analysis using an expect (E) value cutoff of 10-5 and aligned these sequences using the global multiple sequence alignment software ClustalX (26Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar). Sequences that were considered too similar were excluded from the analysis to retain an informative alignment. We found that all sequence conservation resides within a ∼69-amino acid motif, which contains a remarkable number of absolutely conserved residues and is especially rich in aromatic residues and leucine (Fig. 3). BLAST searches using sequences outside the central Soh1/MED31 motif did not return any significant hits between eukaryotic kingdoms. The two mutant alleles previously reported for Soh1/MED31, soh1-1 in S. cerevisiae and sep10-412 in S. pombe, are both caused by premature termination within the Soh1 motif as indicated in Fig. 3 (12Fan H.Y. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1994; 137: 945-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2M. Sipisczki, personal communication. The Hyper-conserved Soh1 Motif Is Required, but Not Sufficient, for Association with S. cerevisiae Mediator—To test the requirements of the hyper-conserved Soh1 motif for Mediator association, we generated a series of S. cerevisiae strains, in which the wild-type SOH1 gene was replaced by mutant versions fused in-frame with a FLAG tag encoding the DNA fragment (Fig. 4A). Mediator was purified from the different strains, and Soh1/MED31 association was probed with immunoblotting against the FLAG tag (Fig. 4B). We could not detect Soh1/MED31 by immunoblotting in total protein extracts, but reverse transcription PCR indicated roughly similar levels of mRNA expression for the mutant constructs (data not shown). Soh1/MED31 was lost from Mediator when we deleted amino acids 1–85 (SOH1Δ3), encompassing the Soh1 motif (position 22–90). Similarly, a replicate of the soh1-1 mutant allele (12Fan H.Y. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1994; 137: 945-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), terminating prematurely at position 46 in the center of the Soh1 motif (SOH1Δ1), failed to associate with Mediator. In contrast, a mutated form of the protein, in which the N-terminal region (position 1–22) outside the Soh1 motif had been deleted (SOH1Δ5), could effectively associate with Mediator, and we could also detect weak Mediator association of a C-terminal deletion mutant (SOH1Δ2). Even if the Soh1 motif is required for stable association with Mediator, it is not sufficient. When we expressed the Soh1 motif in isolation (SOH1Δ4), we observed no association with the Mediator complex. We here report that Soh1/MED31 is a stable component of Mediator isolated from S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. Genetic studies in yeast and the presence of Soh1/MED31 in metazoan Mediator indicate that the association of Soh1/MED31 with S. pombe and S. cerevisiae Mediator is physiologically relevant and not an artifact of biochemical isolation. We believe that our failure to identify Soh1/MED31 in previous characterizations of yeast Mediator complexes (8Spahr H. Beve J. Larsson T. Bergstrom J. Karlsson K.A. Gustafsson C.M. J. Biol.

Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6661) Google Scholar). In this report, we also extended previous work on Mediator subunit conservation and demonstrated that Soh1/MED31 is conserved in protist lineages. The significant conservation of Soh1/MED31 raises interesting questions about the evolution of the eukaryotic transcription machinery. The CTD of RNAP II plays a central part in the entire process of transcription, including initiation, capping of the primary transcript, splicing, and 3′ processing. Phylogenetic analyses of Rpb1 sequences have led to the suggestion that canonical CTD heptads (YSPTSPS) are strongly conserved in only a subset of eukaryotic groups, including fungi, animals, plants, and some protists, which display complex patterns of ontogenetic development (33Stiller J.W. Hall B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6091-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). According to this theory, the enhanced control over RNAP II transcription conveyed by acquired CTD-protein interactions was an important step in the evolution of intricate patterns of gene expression that are a hallmark of large, developmentally complex eukaryotic organisms (33Stiller J.W. Hall B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6091-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The CTD is also important for Mediator function, and a cardinal activity of Mediator is its ability to stimulate TFIIH-dependent CTD phosphorylation (23Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 31Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The Mediator complex interacts directly with CTD (23Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 31Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), and the nine SRB genes encoding for Mediator subunits were first identified in a screen for mutants, which suppress the cold-sensitive phenotype of a CTD truncation mutant (34Nonet M.L. Young R.A. Genetics. 1989; 123: 715-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were therefore surprised to find conserved Soh1/MED31 orthologues in protists like G. intestinalis and P. falciparum, which lack the canonical CTD repeat structure (33Stiller J.W. Hall B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6091-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The observation suggests that an ancient Mediator-like factor might be involved in passing signals from activators and repressors to the RNAP II in eukaryotes that diverged before the establishment of the canonical heptapeptide repeats CTD structure. Finally, despite extensive bioinformatics analysis with different Soh1/MED31 orthologues, we could not detect significant sequence similarity of Soh1/MED31 to DNA- or RNA-dependent RNA polymerases as previously suggested (12Fan H.Y. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1994; 137: 945-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The original assignment of homology could be the result of the substantially smaller dataset available for protein-protein searches that was available during the previous decade. The formulation of the statistical significance of the BLAST algorithm is dependent on the size of the data base, which has grown exponentially since the first publication on Soh1/MED31. Note Added in Proof—Guglielmi et al. arrived independently at the conclusion that MED31 (Soh1) is a subunit of S. cerevisiae Mediator (Guglielmi, B., van Berkum, N. L., Klapholz, B., Bijma, T., Boube, M., Boschiero, C., Bourbon, H. M., Holstege, F. C., and Werner, M. (2004) Nucleic Acids Res. 32, 5379–5391).

https://openalex.org/W2068208625,"In dietary potassium deficiency there is a decrease in the transport activity of the type IIa sodium/phosphate cotransporter protein (NaPi) despite an increase in its apical membrane abundance. This novel posttranslational regulation of NaPi activity is mediated by the increased glycosphingolipid content of the potassium-deficient apical membrane. However, the mechanisms by which these lipids modulate NaPi activity have not been determined. We determined if in potassium deficiency NaPi is increasingly partitioned in cholesterol-, sphingomyelin-, and glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains of the apical membrane and if the increased presence of NaPi in these microdomains modulates its activity. By using a detergent-free density gradient flotation technique, we found that 80% of the apical membrane NaPi partitions into the low density cholesterol-, sphingomyelin-, and GM1-enriched fractions characterized as “lipid raft” fractions. In potassium deficiency, a higher proportion of NaPi was localized in the lipid raft fractions. By combining fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and photon counting histogram methods for control and potassium-deficient apical membranes reconstituted into giant unilamellar vesicles, we showed a 2-fold decrease in lateral diffusion of NaPi protein and a greater than 2-fold increase in size of protein aggregates/clusters in potassium deficiency. Our results indicate that NaPi protein is localized in membrane microdomains, that in potassium deficiency a larger proportion of NaPi protein is present in these microdomains, and that NaPi lateral diffusion is slowed down and NaPi aggregation/clustering is increased in potassium deficiency, both of which could be associated with the decreased Na/Pi cotransport activity in potassium deficiency.

Disorders of extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentration and impairments in renal and gastrointestinal Pi reabsorption are common problems. Aging, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, alcoholism, transplantation, AIDS, and several therapeutic drugs are well known to cause or to be associated with hypophosphatemia or hyperphosphatemia, mainly by affecting renal tubular Pi transport. The kidney plays a critical role in the regulation of Pi homeostasis (1Tenenhouse H.S. Murer H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The evidence to date indicates that regulation of the overall renal tubular Pi transport by dietary, hormonal, or metabolic factors occurs mainly at the level of the proximal tubular apical brush border membrane (BBM) 1The abbreviations used are: BBM, brush border membrane; DR, detergent-resistant; DS, detergent-sensitive; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; GUV, giant unilamellar vesicle; NaPi, sodium/phosphate cotransporter type IIa; PCH, photon counting histogram; 5′NT, 5′-nucleotidase; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Na/Pi cotransport system. Three distinct families of renal Na/Pi cotransporters have been identified: type I, type II, and type III. These Na/Pi cotransporters are expressed in the proximal tubule of humans, rats, mice, and rabbits. The type IIa renal apical BBM Na/Pi cotransport system mediates the majority of the renal proximal tubular BBM Na/Pi transport (1Tenenhouse H.S. Murer H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Dietary factors, hormones, metabolic factors, and the developmental and aging process regulate Na/Pi cotransport activity by diverse molecular and cellular mechanisms, including transcriptional control, translational control, and most importantly control via acute trafficking (endocytosis or exocytosis) of the type IIa Na/Pi cotransport protein to and from the apical membrane. The net result is that with one known notable exception Na/Pi cotransport activity is directly correlated with the apical BBM type IIa Na/Pi cotransport protein abundance (1Tenenhouse H.S. Murer H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that alterations in renal lipid composition, including BBM cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and glycosphingolipid content play an important role in the regulation of renal Na/Pi cotransport activity. Specifically, adaptation to changes in dietary Pi as well as the aging process is associated with alterations in apical BBM cholesterol content, and there is an inverse relationship between BBM Na/Pi transport activity and BBM cholesterol content (2Molitoris B.A. Alfrey A.C. Harris R.A. Simon F.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: F12-F19PubMed Google Scholar, 3Levi M. Jameson D.M. van der Meer B.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F85-F94PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in diabetes, in dietary potassium deficiency, and following treatment with glucocorticoids there is an inverse relationship between BBM Na/Pi transport activity and BBM sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipid (glucosylceramide and ganglioside GM3) content (4Levi M. Shayman J.A. Abe A. Gross S.K. McCluer R.H. Biber J. Murer H. Lotscher M. Cronin R.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Zajicek H.K. Wang H.

We have shown that in isolated BBM in vitro modification of cholesterol composition selectively modulates Na/Pi transport activity and that BBM Na/Pi cotransport activity is directly related to BBM cholesterol content, indicating that changes in membrane cholesterol per se can modulate Na/Pi cotransport activity (6Levi M. Baird B.M. Wilson P.V. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibition of glucosylceramide and ganglioside GM3 synthesis also results in modulation of Na/Pi transport activity (4Levi M. Shayman J.A. Abe A. Gross S.K. McCluer R.H. Biber J. Murer H. Lotscher M. Cronin R.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). An important role for glycosphingolipids in mediating post-translational regulation of Na/Pi cotransport activity is illustrated in dietary potassium deficiency where there is a significant decrease in BBM Na/Pi cotransport activity, which occurs despite an increase in BBM NaPi protein abundance. Treatment of potassium-deficient rats with an inhibitor of glucosylceramide and ganglioside GM3 synthesis normalizes BBM Na/Pi cotransport activity, despite no changes in NaPi protein abundance (5Zajicek H.K.

This study therefore indicates an important and a novel role for lipids in mediating posttranslational regulation of Na/Pi cotransport activity. Although our previous studies do indicate that alterations in cholesterol and glycosphingolipid composition modulate renal Na/Pi cotransport activity, the mechanisms by which lipids modulate Na/Pi cotransport activity have not been determined and remain unknown. Most interestingly, cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and glycosphingolipids are important components and mediators of formation of specialized membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts (7Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 8Brown D.A. Jacobson K.

We have shown previously by using fluorescence spectroscopy and two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy techniques that cholesterol and glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains or lipid rafts are present in the renal BBM, that these domains have a marked decrease in lipid dynamics, and that the formation of these domains is modulated by the cholesterol content of the membrane (13Levi M.

The purposes of the present study are as follows: 1) to determine whether the Na/Pi cotransport protein is present in these cholesterol-, sphingomyelin-, and glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains or lipid rafts, 2) to determine whether in the model of dietary potassium deficiency there is increased partitioning of the Na/Pi cotransport protein in these membrane microdomains, and 3) to determine whether the partitioning of the NaPi protein in these membrane microdomains modulates its activity and its dynamics in the BBM lipid bilayer. In this work we explore protein dynamics by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). This technique has been shown to be a noninvasive method that allows for the measurement of freely diffusing and bound molecules inside live cells in small volumes (sub-femtoliters) (30Ruan Q.

In the present study we use giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) grown from renal BBM, and we measure the diffusion and clustering properties of NaPi in the membrane. The results indicate the following. 1) By using detergent-free isolation of apical membrane domains, the Na/Pi cotransport protein does preferentially partition into cholesterol-, sphingomyelin-, and glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains that have a marked decrease in lipid dynamics. 2) In apical brush border membranes isolated from potassium-deficient rats, there is a further increased presence of Na/Pi cotransport protein in these membrane microdomains that correlates with decreased Na/Pi cotransport activity despite increased Na/Pi cotransport protein abundance. 3) By using FCS, we show for the first time that increased partitioning of the NaPi protein in the cholesterol-, sphingomyelin-, and glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains results in a marked decrease in the lateral diffusion and a marked increase in the aggregation/clustering of Na/Pi cotransport protein that is associated with decreased Na/Pi cotransport activity. Animals—Six-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing between 150 and 175 g were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Madison, WI) and housed at the animal facility where they were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle. The animals were fed a control diet (Teklad, TD88238) or a potassium-deficient diet (Teklad, TD95006) for 14 days (5Zajicek H.K. Wang H. Puttaparthi K. Halaihel N. Markovich D. Shayman J. Beliveau R.

Isolation of Brush Border Membrane Vesicles—Rats were anesthetized via an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium (Pentothal, Abbott). After clamping off the renal vessels, the kidneys were removed, and thin slices from the superficial cortex were dissected on ice. The superficial cortex kidney slices were homogenized in 15 ml of an ice-cold isolation buffer consisting of 300 mm mannitol, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 16 mm HEPES, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, using a Polytron homogenizer (90 s at 40% power). The BBM were isolated from the homogenate by Mg2+ precipitation followed by differential centrifugation as described previously (3Levi M. Jameson D.M. van der Meer B.W. Am. J.

After 20 min of shaking, the homogenate was centrifuged at 2,790 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was subjected to another round of Mg2+ precipitation, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting BBM pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 300 mm mannitol, 16 mm HEPES, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and aliquoted for (a) measurement of total protein concentration, (b) Na/Pi cotransport activity measurement, (c) protein electrophoresis and Western blotting, (d) OptiPrep gradient flotation for the isolation of BBM fractions, and (e) preparation of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) for FCS measurements.

To measure sodium gradient-dependent 32Pi uptake (Na/Pi cotransport), 10 μl of BBM or membrane fragments preloaded in an intravesicular buffer (in mm) of 300 mannitol, 16 HEPES, and 10 Tris, pH 7.5, was vortex-mixed at 25 °C with 40 μl of an extra-vesicular uptake buffer of 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm K2H32PO4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 16 mm HEPES, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Sodium gradient-dependent d-[3H]glucose uptake (sodium/glucose cotransport) was measured as above except for using 100 μm d-[3H]glucose. Uptake was terminated after 5 s (representing the initial linear rate) by an ice-cold stop solution. All uptake measurements were performed in triplicate, and uptake was calculated on the basis of specific activity determined in each experiment and expressed as pmol Pi or d-glucose × (5 s)-1 × (mg of BBM protein)-1. Isolation of BBM Detergent-resistant and Detergent-sensitive Fractions—For isolation of detergent-resistant (DR) and detergent-sensitive (DS) BBM fractions, the BBM sample was first incubated for 30 min on ice in TNET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture) containing 1% Triton X-100 or 1% Lubrol WX (19Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h, the DR (pellet) and DS (supernatant) fractions were collected and analyzed for (a) total protein by BCA protein assay (Pierce) and (b) Western blots for NaPi. Isolation of BBM Lipid Raft Fractions by Non-detergent Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation Using OptiPrep (Iodixanol)—BBM were incubated in 100 μl of TNET buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. After Dounce homogenization on ice, the extract was adjusted to 50% Optiprep, after which 600 μl was overlaid with 1 ml each of 40, 30, and 20% Optiprep in TNET and then 400 μl of 10% Optiprep in TNET (20Liang X.

Following centrifugation at 170,000 × g at 4 °C for 4 h, a continuous density gradient was formed. 8× 500-μl fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient and analyzed for (a) total protein by BCA protein assay (Pierce); (b) Western blots for NaPi, SGLT-1, NHE3, NHERF-1, PDZK-1, MAP-17, β-actin, ezrin, 5′NT, and flotillin-1; and (c) lipid composition. Protein Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Intact BBM or BBM membrane fraction samples were denatured for 3 min at 95 °C in 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 95 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Samples corresponding to 10 μg of total protein were loaded on 9% polyacrylamide gels (Criterion gels, Bio-Rad) and separated according to the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207858) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose paper (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44969) Google Scholar). After blockage with 5% nonfat milk powder with 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm, pH 7.3), blots were incubated with antiserum against the C-terminal amino acid sequence of NaPi at a dilution of 1:4,000. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:50,000. Primary antibody binding was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce), and the signals were quantified in a PhosphorImager with chemiluminescence detection and densitometry software (Bio-Rad). The protein blots were also probed with antiserum against β-actin (1:5000), ezrin (1:500), MAP-17 (1:1000), NHERF-1 (1:3000), PDZK-1 (1:10,000), SGLT-1 (1:500), NHE3 (1:2000), 5′NT (1:200), and flotillin-1 (1:500). Lipid Extraction and Measurement of Lipid Composition—Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). Total cholesterol was determined enzymatically using Amplex Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, or Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Sphingomyelin was determined with a fluorescence assay (25He X. Chen F. McGovern M.M. Schuchman E.H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 306: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), using reagents supplied in the Amplex Red Sphingomyelinase kit (Molecules Probes). To determine GM1 content, the BBM were incubated with Alexa 555-labeled cholera toxin B (Molecular Probes), which binds to GM1. After separation of the BBM fractions by flotation on an OptiPrep gradient, the relative intensity of the Alexa 555 signal in each fraction was determined in a fluorescence spectrometer (26Magnani F. Tate C. Wynne S. Williams C. Haase J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38770-38778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The signal from each fraction was corrected against blank fractions from an OptiPrep gradient that was seeded with an identical amount of Alexa 555-cholera toxin B in buffer but no BBM. Measurement of NaPi Lateral Diffusion and Aggregation/Clustering by FCS and PCH—Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements were performed on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) grown from intact BBM. GUVs were prepared by the electroformation method developed by Angelova and Dimitrov (27Angelova M. Dimitrov D. Faraday Discuss. Chem.

Briefly, membrane samples were laid onto platinum wires and dried in a temperature-controlled chamber that fits on the microscope stage. The membranes were then hydrated in buffer at about 43 °C (above the liquid-ordered to liquid-disordered phase transition temperature) and in the presence of an alternating electric field (10 Hz, 3V). A highly specific and affinity-purified anti-NaPi rabbit polyclonal antibody (5Zajicek H.K. Wang H. Puttaparthi K. Halaihel N. Markovich D. Shayman J. Beliveau R. Wilson P. Rogers T. Levi M.

Conjugates were labeled with an average of three dye molecules per antibody molecule. FCS measurements were performed at 37 °C as described previously (28Bagatolli L.A. Gratton E. Biophys.

J. 2002; 83: 3177-3187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) by using two-photon excitation at 785 nm. The two-photon excitation scanning fluorescence microscope used in these experiments was assembled in the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign) and has been described previously (31Ruan Q. Chen Y. Gratton E. Glaser M. Mantulin W.W. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3177-3187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A mode-locked titanium-sapphire laser with 80-MHz, 100-fs pulse width (Tsunami; Spectra-Physics, Mountain view, CA) was used as the excitation light source. The laser was guided into the microscope by x-y galvano-scanner mirrors (model 6350; Cambridge Technology, Watertown, MA) to achieve beam scanning in both x and y directions. The scanner mirrors were moved by a voltage generated in a computer card. The movement of the x scanner mirror was independent from the y scanner mirror movement. For the laser beam to move in a circular path, the x and y scanner mirrors were driven by two identical sine waves with 90° phase shift. The radius and frequency of the circular scan were controlled by the amplitude and frequency of the sine waves. For a raster scan, the x and y scanner mirrors were driven by two saw-tooth signals at different frequency. A photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu R7400P, Japan) was used for light detection in the photon counting mode. A BG39 optical filter (Chroma Technologies, Brattleboro, VT) was placed before the photomultiplier for suppression of IR excitation light. A Zeiss C-Apo 40X (1.2 N.A.), water-immersion objective lens was used for the measurement because of its exceptionally long working distance (230 μm). Two-photon Microscopy, FCS, Scanning FCS, and PCH Analysis— For two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging, the scanning areas ranged from 70 × 70 μm to 18 × 18 μm. Images were 256 × 256 pixels and averages of 10 frames with a pixel residence time of 50 μs. Regions of interest were directly selected from the fluorescence image. For single point FCS, the sampling rate was 64 kHz, and the total measurement lasted less than 5 min. For scanning FCS the orbital scanning frequency was 1 kHz with a sampling rate (pixel rate) of either 40 or 64 kHz and total measurement times of 400 or 255 s, respectively. The laser power at the sample was 10 milliwatts. The average fluorescence intensity of the sample remained constant, indicating that the fluorophore was not photobleached during the measurement. Because of the variation in the laser alignment from day to day, the waist ω0 of the excitation beam was calibrated before each day's measurement by measuring an autocorrelation curve of 10 nm fluorescein in 0.01 m NaOH. ω0 was derived from a fit to this curve by assuming a fluorescein diffusion coefficient of 300 μm2/s; typically ω0 values of 0.3 μmto0.5 μm were obtained. The autocorrelation function, G(τ) in Equation 1, was used to analyze the fluorescence fluctuations, where N(t) is the fluorescence intensity at time t; τ is some absolute time delay, and the angle brackets denote a time average. For a single molecular species the autocorrelation function at τ = 0 (G(0)) is inversely proportional to the average number of molecules in the excitation volume (Equation 2). Gi(τ)=〈N(t)N(t+τ)〉〈N(t)〉2−1 Eq.1 Gi(0)=Var(N(t))(Avg(N(t)))2=1N Eq.2 For single point FCS data, the experimental autocorrelation function was fitted using a three-dimensional Gaussian-Lorentzian beam profile (32Berland K.M.

Besides being an intermediate in polyamine metabolism, recent findings indicate that agmatine may play important regulatory roles in mammals. Agmatinase is a binuclear manganese metalloenzyme and belongs to the ureohydrolase superfamily that includes arginase, formiminoglutamase, and proclavaminate amidinohydrolase. Compared with a wealth of structural information available for arginases, no three-dimensional structure of agmatinase has been reported. Agmatinase from Deinococcus radiodurans, a 304-residue protein, shows ∼33% of sequence identity to human mitochondrial agmatinase. Here we report the crystal structure of D. radiodurans agmatinase in Mn2+-free, Mn2+-bound, and Mn2+-inhibitor-bound forms, representing the first structure of agmatinase. It reveals the conservation as well as variation in folding, oligomerization, and the active site of the ureohydrolase superfamily. D. radiodurans agmatinase exists as a compact homohexamer of 32 symmetry. Its binuclear manganese cluster is highly similar but not identical to the clusters of arginase and proclavaminate amidinohydrolase.

The classic pathway for polyamine biosynthesis proceeds from l-arginine to putrescine by the action of arginase and ornithine decarboxylase. Arginase cleaves the terminal guanidine moiety of l-arginine to produce ornithine and urea, and ornithine decarboxylase in turn converts ornithine into putrescine by decarboxylation (Fig. 1A) (1Wu G. Morris S.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar). Bacteria, plants, and other lower species synthesize polyamines via a second distinct pathway where arginine is first decarboxylated to agmatine (1-amino-4-guanidinobutane) by arginine decarboxylase followed by the removal of urea to form putrescine by agmatinase (agmatine ureohydrolase, E.C. 3.5.3.11) (Fig. 1A) (2Satishchandran C.

Agmatine has also been proposed to act as a possible neurotransmitter/neuromodulator. It binds to α2-adrenoreceptors and imidazoline-binding sites and blocks N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor channels and other ligandgated cationic channels (12Reis D.J. Regunathan S. Trends Pharmacol.

Changes in activity or expression of agmatinase could play an important role in regulating the physiological actions of agmatine.Agmatinase is a binuclear manganese metalloenzyme and belongs to the ureohydrolase superfamily (14Ouzounis C.A. Kyrpides N.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Sekowska A. Danchin A. Risler J.L. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1815-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Other members of this superfamily include arginase, formiminoglutamase, and proclavaminate amidinohydrolase (PAH). 1The abbreviations used are: PAH, proclavaminate amidinohydrolase; DR, Deinococcus radiodurans; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.1The abbreviations used are: PAH, proclavaminate amidinohydrolase; DR, Deinococcus radiodurans; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. We suggest using the term “ureohydrolase superfamily,” because it is more suited to describe a variety of substrates that its members hydrolyze (Fig. 1B) than the term “arginase superfamily.” An analysis of the evolutionary relationship among ureohydrolase superfamily enzymes indicates that the sequence similarity trees separate agmatinases from arginases including Deinococcus radiodurans (DR) agmatinase (15Sekowska A. Danchin A. Risler J.L. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1815-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the arginase pathway of polyamine biosynthesis is likely to have evolved later than the pathway involving arginine decarboxylase and agmatinase (15Sekowska A. Danchin A. Risler J.L. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1815-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among the ureohydrolase superfamily members, crystal structures are available for rat liver arginase I (16Kanyo Z.F. Scolnick L.R. Ash D.E. Chistianson D.W.

Structure. 1999; 7: 435-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and PAH from Streptomyces clavuligerus (19Elkins J.M. Clifton I.J. Hernandez H. Doan L.X.

They revealed the trimeric or hexameric structure and the active site with a binuclear manganese cluster. In contrast, no three-dimensional structure of agmatinase has been reported.The cloning of the human agmatinase gene encoding a 352-residue protein with a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence at the amino terminus was reported previously (10Iyer R.K. Kim H.K. Tsoa R.W. Grody W.W. Cederbaum S.D. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 75: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Mistry S.K. Burwell T.J. Chambers R.M. Rudolph-Owen L. Spaltmann F. Cook W.J. Morris S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G375-G381Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of human agmatinase is more similar to bacterial agmatinases than to human arginases I and II (∼30% sequence identity versus 20.0 and 22.1% identity, respectively). For example, DR agmatinase shows a relatively high level (33.3/62.4% over 324 amino acid overlap) of sequence identity/similarity to human mitochondrial agmatinase but it shows considerably lower levels (20.2/49.1% and 16.9/50.0% for 346 and 344 amino acid overlaps, respectively) of sequence identity/similarity to human arginases I and II. Likewise, DR arginase shows unusually high levels (35.0/67.2% and 31.1/65.0% for 326 and 334 amino acid overlaps, respectively) of sequence identity/similarity to human arginases I and II, whereas it is much less similar to human and DR agmatinases (21.5/49.1% and 14.3/52.3% over 344 and 308 amino acid overlaps, respectively). Thus, the three-dimensional structure of DR agmatinase will be a useful model for human mitochondrial agmatinase. Here we have determined the crystal structure of DR agmatinase in Mn2+-free, Mn2+-bound, and Mn2+-inhibitor-bound forms. It reveals that DR agmatinase exists as a compact homohexamer of 32 symmetry and has a binuclear manganese cluster that is highly similar to those of arginase and proclavaminate amidinohydrolase. The structure of the enzyme in complex with 1,6-diaminohexane, an inhibitor of agmatinase, provides insights into ligand binding and inhibition mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Production and Crystallization—DR agmatinase with both NH2- and COOH-terminal fusion tags was overexpressed and crystallized in the Mn2+-inhibitor-bound form in the presence of 1,6-diaminohexane as described previously (20Lee J.A.

Additionally, we have grown crystals of the Mn2+-free enzyme under the reservoir condition of 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, 0.1 m sodium phosphate citrate (pH 4.2), 0.2 m NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA. Crystals of the Mn2+-bound but inhibitor-free enzyme were also obtained in the absence of EDTA and in the presence of 30 mm glycyl-glycyl-glycine.X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination—X-ray diffraction data of the Mn2+-free and Mn2+-bound crystals were collected at 100 K on a DIP-2030 image plate detector (MacScience Co.) at Beamline BL-6B of Pohang Light Source as described for the Mn2+-inhibitor-bound form (20Lee J.A.

The data were processed with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38349) Google Scholar). Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement using a hexamer model (Protein Data Bank code 1GQ7) of PAH from S. clavuligerus. Cross-rotational search followed by translational search was performed using the program CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 57: 1013-1019Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to give an initial model, which accounted for ∼80% of the backbone of the polypeptide chain with much of the sequence assigned. Subsequent manual model building was done using the program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar). The model was refined with the program CNS, and subsequent rounds of model building, simulated annealing, positional refinement, and individual B-factor refinement were then performed. The non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were relaxed in successive rounds of refinement. Water molecules were added using CNS followed by visual inspection and B-factor refinement. The refined model of the Mn2+-inhibitor-bound form, accounting for 1,818 residues of the six independent monomers and 844 water molecules in the asymmetric unit, gave Rwork and Rfree values of 22.3 and 25.1%, respectively, for the 30.0–1.80-Å data. The model includes residues 3–304 of DR agmatinase and an additional leucine residue from the COOH-terminal fusion tag. Subsequently, this model was used to solve the Mn2+-free and Mn2+-bound structures (Table I).Ureohydrolase Activity Assay and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The ureohydrolase activity was assayed by a modification of the method described by Carvajal et al. (25Carvajal N. López V. Salas M. Uribe E. Herrera P. Cerpa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) for the colorimetric detection of urea. 1 μl of DR agmatinase (at a concentration of 0.094 μg ml-1) was mixed into a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 20 mm MnCl2, and 100 mm agmatine in a total volume of 600 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, 540 μl of a 3:1 mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid and 75 μl of 3% (w/v) diacetylmonoxime in ethanol were added, mixed well by inversion, and incubated in a boiling water bath for 1 h. Urea production was detected by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. The concentration of urea produced was calculated by comparison with a urea standard curve. The N159H mutant of DR agmatinase was prepared by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) employing as template the pET-28b(+) plasmid carrying the DR agmatinase gene. The desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMonomer Structure—The overall monomer fold of DR agmatinase is shown in Fig. 2 together with the electron density of manganese ions, water molecules, and the inhibitor at the active site. The structures of the six independent monomers in the asymmetric unit of the crystal are essentially identical to each other. The root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) ranged between 0.19 and 0.23 Å when we compared 303 Cα atoms of monomer A against those of other monomers B–F for each of the three crystal structures. The binding of Mn2+ ions and the inhibitor results in no large changes in the monomer structure. The r.m.s.d. is 0.08 Å between the Mn2+-free and Mn2+-bound structures, 0.11 Å between the Mn2+-free and Mn2+-inhibitor-bound structures, and 0.07 Å between the Mn2+-bound and Mn2+-inhibitor-bound structures (for comparing 303 Cα atoms of monomer A).Fig. 2Stereoview of DR agmatinase monomer, electron density of the active site, and cis-peptide bond.A, ribbon diagram of monomer.

One or two α-helices connect one strand to the next in such a way that a set of four helices (α3, α4, α5, and α6) covers one face of the β-sheet and another set of seven helices (α1, α2, α7, α8, α9, α10, and α11) covers the other face (Fig. 2A). Two additional strands β2 and β3 are inserted between α2 and β4, forming a protruding β-hairpin. Between DR agmatinase (monomer A) and S. clavuligerus PAH, insertions/deletions are minimal and the root mean square difference is 1.31 Å for 254 Cα atoms (sequence identity 28.7%). There are more insertions/deletions for the sequence alignment of DR agmatinase with rat liver arginase I and B. caldovelox arginase. The root mean square differences are 1.30 Å for rat liver arginase I (210 Cα atoms; sequence identity 19.2%) and 1.28 Å for B. caldovelox arginase (214 Cα atoms; sequence identity 21.9%), respectively.DR agmatinase has two cis-peptide bonds between Pro64 and Pro65 and between Gly118 and Gly119. The first cis-peptide bond is part of a highly variable sequence region (Fig. 3) and is unique to DR agmatinase. The second cis-peptide bond between Gly118 and Gly119 is part of the conserved Gly-Gly-Asp-His motif in the ureohydrolase superfamily (15Sekowska A. Danchin A. Risler J.L.

The backbone nitrogen atom of Gly119 is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Ala48, and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly119 is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone nitrogen of Glu274 (Fig. 2D). This constellation of hydrogen bonds is important in positioning the key active site residues His121 and Glu274. His121, one of the ligands for MnA, is part of the Gly-Gly-Asp-His motif. Glu274 is also well conserved, and its equivalent (Glu277 in rat and Glu271 in B. caldovelox) was implicated for interactions with the guanidium (or guanidine) group of the substrate (16Kanyo Z.F.

Scolnick L.R. Ash D.E. Chistianson D.W. Nature. 1996; 383: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), whereas bacterial arginases are hexameric (26Jenkinson C.P. Grody W.W. Cederbaum S.D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1996; 114: 107-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In the case of B. caldovelox arginase, the crystal structure revealed two possible hexamers (18Bewley M.C. Jeffrey P.D. Patchett M.L. Kanyo Z.F. Baker E.N. Structure. 1999; 7: 435-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hexamer 1 was commonly observed in both crystal forms (I and II) and was assumed to be the one preferentially formed in solution. Hexamer 2 was seen in crystal form I only. This additional mode of association resulted in long oligomeric arrays that formed tubes of molecules extending through the crystal lattice. S. clavuligerus PAH exists as a hexamer both in solution and under crystallization conditions (19Elkins J.M. Clifton I.J. Hernandez H. Doan L.X. Robinson C.V. Schofield C.J. Hewitson K.S. Biochem.

The result of our dynamic light-scattering experiment was consistent with DR agmatinase being a tetramer, pentamer, or hexamer in solution (20Lee J.A. Ahn H.J. Ha J.Y. Shim S.M. Kim K.H. Kim H.K.

The crystal structure of DR agmatinase shows that it exists as a compact hexamer of 32 symmetry with approximate dimensions of 75 × 80 × 80 Å (Fig. 4A). The binding of Mn2+ ions and/or the inhibitor induces no significant change in either the monomer or the hexamer structure. The r.m.s.d. is 0.11 Å between the Mn2+-free and Mn2+-bound structures, 0.17 Å between the Mn2+-free and Mn2+-inhibitor-bound structures, and 0.10 Å between the Mn2+-bound and Mn2+-inhibitor-bound structures for 1,818 Cα atoms in a hexamer.Fig. 4Hexamers of DR agmatinase, and B. caldovelox arginase, and structural comparison of DR agmatinase and rat liver arginase I trimers.A, six subunits (A–F) of DR agmatinase are colored in red, magenta, yellow, cyan, green, and blue, respectively.

To aid comprehension, inhibitors can be characterized through kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural dissection to build an “inhibition profile.” Here we dissect the binding of a tetrahydrooxazine inhibitor and its derivatives, which display Ki values around 500 nm. X-ray structures with both a β-glucosidase, at 2 Å resolution, and an endoglucanase at atomic (∼1 Å) resolution reveal similar interactions between the tetrahydrooxazine inhibitor and both enzymes. Kinetic analyses reveal the pH dependence of kcat/Km and 1/Ki with both enzyme systems, and isothermal titration calorimetry unveils the enthalpic and entropic contributions to β-glucosidase inhibition. The pH dependence of enzyme activity mirrored that of 1/Ki in both enzymes, unlike the cases of isofagomine and 1-deoxynojirimycin that have been characterized previously. Calorimetric dissection reveals a large favorable enthalpy that is partially offset by an unfavorable entropy upon binding.

Glycoside hydrolases are believed to increase the rate of glycosidic bond hydrolysis by a factor of 1017, making them among the most proficient of enzymes (1Wolfenden R. Lu X. Young G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6814-6815Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Taking into account the substrate Km, it is estimated that these enzymes thus bind the transition state with a resultant dissociation constant of 10-22m (1Wolfenden R. Lu X. Young G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6814-6815Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Many glycoside hydrolase inhibitors attempt to mimic features of the transition state to take advantage of this huge binding capacity (recently reviewed by Vasella et al. (2Vasella A. Davies G. Böhm M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar)). Most inhibitors synthesized to date, however, have not been able to harness even half of the theoretical binding capacity. Glycoside hydrolases have been classified into over 90 families based on sequence similarity (see afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/ and Ref. 3Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Svensson B. Henrissat B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Engineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar). In some cases, these families are further grouped into clans, which display the same structural folds and catalytic apparatus. The largest grouping is known as clan GH-A and unites a variety of retaining glycoside hydrolases that all feature a (β/α)8 topology with two glutamates, on strands β-4 and β-7, acting as acid/base and nucleophile, respectively (4Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These enzymes perform hydrolysis with retention of configuration via a double displacement mechanism through a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Protonation of the glycosidic oxygen by the acid/base residue is accompanied by attack of the nucleophile on the anomeric carbon, forming the intermediate. In a second step, a water molecule is deprotonated by the acid/base, providing a nucleophilic species to attack the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate and cause displacement of the sugar (Scheme 1). Both the glycosylation and deglycosylation steps pass through dissociative transition states with significant oxocarbenium ion character. At or near this transition state, the anomeric carbon displays sp2 hybridization, and extensive positive charge delocalization is manifested, in particular along the bond between the endocyclic oxygen and anomeric carbon. Sinnott has shown that at or near the transition state, the pyranoside ring will adopt one of two half-chair conformations (4H3/3H4 or their related envelope conformations) or two classical boat (2,5B/B2,5) conformations (32Davies G.J. Sinnott M.L. Withers S.G. Sinnot M.L. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 1. Academic Press, London1997: 119-209Google Scholar), and recent structural work confirms that different enzymes utilize these different conformations (reviewed in Ref. 5Davies G.J. Ducros V.M.-A.

Trans. 2003; 31: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Scheme 1The mechanism of β-glycoside hydrolysis with net retention of anomeric configuration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A very large number of glycosidase inhibitors have been synthesized that attempt to mimic various characteristics of the transition state. A significant confusion is that the term “transition state mimicry” is often used, quite reasonably, by some authors to describe tight binding inhibitors that have obvious and intuitive resemblance to the putative transition state, whereas others reserve this term exclusively for those compounds for which there is a quantifiable correlation between the binding of the inhibitor and the transition state (6Withers S.G. Namchuk M. Mosi R. Stutz A.E. Iminosugars as Glycosidase Inhibitors: Nojirimycin and Beyond. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1999: 188-206Google Scholar). Wolfenden, Bartlett, and others (7Wolfenden R. Snider M.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 938-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 8Snider M.J. Wolfenden R.

Rev. 1997; 97: 1281-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) go further and suggest that the binding of true transition state mimics must be driven by large and favorable changes in enthalpy, as is the case for the corresponding transition state. Unfortunately, there is often disagreement as to the mechanistic interpretation of tight binding and a variety of methods, including x-ray crystallography, kinetics, and (increasingly) thermodynamics have been used to clarify these issues. In the above context, we describe here the characterization of two enzymes: the family GH1 β-glucosidase from Thermotoga maritima (TmGH1) 1The abbreviations used are: TmGH1, family 1 glycoside hydrolase from T. maritima; Cel5A, family 5 endoglucanase from B. agaradhaerens. in complex with the tetrahydrooxazine inhibitor (Fig. 2, compound 1) and the family GH5 endoglucanase from Bacillus agaradhaerens (Cel5A) in complex with the cellobio and cellotrio-derived tetrahydrooxazines (compounds 2 and 3). β-Glucosidase inhibition of TmGH1 with compound 1 is shown to be highly enthalpically favorable (significantly better than either deoxynojirimycin 5 or isofagomine 6 in this respect (10Zechel D.L. Boraston A.B. Gloster T. Boraston C.M. Macdonald J.M. Tilbrook D.M.G. Stick R.V. Davies G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14313-14323Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)). Kinetic analysis of kcat/Km and 1/Ki on the two enzymes shows that the pH dependence of inhibition of 1 and 3 is similar to that of catalysis, again in contrast to the binding of 5 and 6, which is optimal at higher pH (10Zechel D.L. Boraston A.B. Gloster T. Boraston C.M. Macdonald J.M. Tilbrook D.M.G. Stick R.V. Davies G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14313-14323Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures at resolutions from 2.0 to 1.0 Å reveal that the tetrahydrooxazine derivatives indeed make very similar interactions to those of the natural substrates, due to the inclusion of the O5 endocyclic oxygen. In contrast to initial studies suggesting that tetrahydrooxazine is a poor inhibitor (23Bach P. Bols M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 3461-3464Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we suggest that in terms of the similar profile for the pH dependence of 1/Ki and the pH dependence of kcat/Km, the significant enthalpy of binding when compared with other glycosidase inhibitors, and the tight binding at the optimal pH of the enzymes tested, oxazine derivatives are a significantly better class of glycosidase inhibitor than assumed previously. Kinetics—The pH dependence of kcat/Km for TmGH1 was measured using the substrate depletion method at low substrate concentration (where [S] << Km). Studies were conducted by monitoring the change in UV/visible absorbance with a Cintra 10 spectrophotometer, equipped with a Thermocell Peltier temperature controller. Assays were performed at 25 °C using 2,4-dinitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside as substrate. Reactions were carried out using a final concentration of 12.5 μm substrate, 100 mm buffer, and 1 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin (except below pH 5 where precipitation was observed) in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of TmGH1 to give a final concentration of between 32 and 151 nm enzyme. Assays were carried out at pH values ranging from 4 to 8; 100 mm sodium citrate buffer was used from pH 4 to 6, and 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer was used from pH 6 to 8. Overlapping data points from each buffer indicated that there was no significant change in enzyme activity. 2,4-Dinitrophenolate release was monitored continuously at 405 nm for a minimum of 10 min, and the data were fit to a first order rate equation (Equation 1) using GRAFIT 5.0 (11Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 5. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK2001Google Scholar). The rate constant for the curve (k = Vmax/Km), adjusted for the enzyme concentration, gives the kcat/Km. The data for kcat/Km dependence on pH were fit to a bell ionization curve (Equation 2) using GRAFIT 5.0 (11Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 5.

Values of kcat/Km were determined from pseudo first order rate curves in the presence and absence of inhibitor. Assay conditions remained the same as above except for the addition of between 0.25 and 25 μm1 (which encompassed the Ki value at each pH). TmGH1 concentrations ranged from 32 to 232 nm. Data were fit to a first order rate equation (Equation 1) using GRAFIT 5.0 (11Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 5. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK2001Google Scholar), and the rate constant was adjusted for the enzyme concentration to give the kcat/Km. The apparent Km/kcat values at different inhibitor concentrations were plotted against the inhibitor concentration. The -Ki was taken as the value where the best fit line through the points crossed the x axis. The data for 1/Ki dependence on pH were fit to a bell ionization curve (Equation 2) using GRAFIT 5.0 (11Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 5. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK2001Google Scholar). Cel5A kinetics and Ki determinations were performed using 2,4-dinitrophenyl β-lactoside as substrate with the release of the dinitrophenolate ion measured at 400 nm. All reactions were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm citrate/phosphate buffer containing 1 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin. The pH versus kcat/Km profile was determined via the substrate depletion method, with substrate present at less than 1/10 Km. Ki values at each pH were determined from Dixon plots using inhibitors 2–4 at concentrations spanning 1/3 to 3 times the Ki and the 2,4-dinitrophenyl β-lactoside concentration near the Km value. Kinetic data were again fitted using GRAFIT 5.0 (11Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 5. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK2001Google Scholar). Structure Determination—TmGH1 and Cel5A were expressed and purified as described previously (10Zechel D.L. Boraston A.B. Gloster T. Boraston C.M. Macdonald J.M. Tilbrook D.M.G. Stick R.V. Davies G.J.

TmGH1 was crystallized by vapor diffusion via the hanging drop method from 0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.2 m calcium acetate, and 15% polyethylene glycol 4000. A minute amount of a highly concentrated stock of 1 (synthesis described in Ref. 13Best W.M. Macdonald J.M. Skelton B.W. Stick R.V. Tilbrook D.M.G. White A.H. Can. J.

Crystals were cryo-protected in a solution containing mother liquor with 25% ethylene glycol and harvested into rayon fiber loops prior to flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Cel5A was crystallized from 1.3 m ammonium sulfate, pH 5.0. Minute amounts of highly concentrated stocks of 2 or 3 (synthesis described in Refs. 13Best W.M. Macdonald J.M. Skelton B.W. Stick R.V.

Crystals were cryo-protected in mother liquor containing 25% glycerol prior to freezing. Data for all complexes were collected from single crystals at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, beamline ID14-1. Data for TmGH1 in complex with 1 were collected to 2.0 Å resolution, and for Cel5A in complex with 2 and 3, data were collected to 1.2 and 1.0 Å resolution, respectively. Data were processed and reduced with DENZO and SCALEPACK (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276A: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). All other calculations used the CCP4 suite of programs (16Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). TmGH1 crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 94.6 Å, b = 94.6 Å, and c = 113.5 Å; Cel5A crystals also belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 54.6 Å, b = 69.6 Å, and c = 76.8 Å. The TmGH1 structure was solved using the protein atoms only from Protein Data Bank entry 1OD0 using rigid body refinement in REFMAC (17Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar); the Cel5A complexes were solved in the same way using the protein atoms only from Protein Data Bank entry 1OCQ. Five percent of the observations were set aside for cross validation and were used to monitor refinement strategies such as geometric and temperature factor restraint values. Manual corrections of the model using X-FIT in QUANTA (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) were interspersed with cycles of least squares refinement using the maximum likelihood program REFMAC (17Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Water molecules were added automatically using ARP/wARP (18Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and manually using X-SOLVATE in QUANTA. All were inspected prior to deposition. Energy-minimized ligand molecules were created using the CHARMm function in QUANTA, and dictionaries were created using “monomer library sketcher” in the CCP4 suite. The models were validated using PROCHECK (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the co-ordinates were deposited with the Macromolecular Structure Database at the European Bioinformatics Institute (autodep.ebi.ac.uk). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed using a VP calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA). TmGH1 was dialyzed into 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.8, using a 10-kDa cut-off polythersulfone membrane concentration device (Viva-science) to a final concentration of 50 μm (calculated using absorbance measured at 280 nm and a molar extinction coefficient of 118,630 m-1 cm-1). 1 was diluted in the same buffer to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Both samples were spun and degassed prior to use. Titrations were performed by injecting 10 μl aliquots of 1 into TmGH1 (cell volume 1.35 ml). Data were corrected for heats of dilution by subtracting the excess heat at high molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme. The stoichiometry (n), enthalpy (ΔH), and equilibrium association constant (Ka) were determined from fitting to a bimolecular model using Microcal Origin software. C values (where C = Ka × [protein] × n) were greater than 100. The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and entropy (TΔS) were calculated using the equation ΔG = -RTlnKa = ΔH - TΔS. Aza sugars are a well documented class of glycosidase inhibitor. At an intuitive level, their positively charged ammonium ions are believed to reflect the charge distribution of the oxocarbenium ion-like transition states (Scheme 1). Perhaps the best described examples are deoxynojirimycin 5 (reviewed in Ref. 20Ganem B. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 340-347Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and isofagomine 6 (synthesized by Bols and colleagues (21Jespersen T.M. Dong W.L. Sierks M.R. Skrydstrup T. Lundt I. Bols M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1778-1779Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and Ichikawa et al. (22Ichikawa Y. Igarashi Y. Ichikawa M. Suhara Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3007-3018Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar)). Tetrahydrooxazine 1, originally synthesized (racemically) in pioneering work by Bach and Bols (23Bach P. Bols M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 3461-3464Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and later by Stick and co-workers (13Best W.M. Macdonald J.M. Skelton B.W. Stick R.V. Tilbrook D.M.G. White A.H. Can. J. Chem. 2002; 80: 857-865Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was conceived as a potentially better mimic of the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state as it incorporates the endocyclic oxygen that is absent from isofagomine 6. Inhibition at a single (undefined) pH proved disappointing with 1, appearing to be 500 times less potent than 6 (23Bach P. Bols M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 3461-3464Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The recent glycosynthase-catalyzed synthesis of a range of cello-oligosaccharide-derived tetrahydrooxazine inhibitors (14Macdonald J.M. Stick R.V. Tilbrook D.M.G. Withers S.G. Aust. J. Chem. 2002; 55: 747-752Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) again revealed ∼1000-fold worse inhibition, at pH 7.0, when compared with their isofagomine counterparts. Given recent observations of the pH behavior of 1/Ki for isofagomine and its derivatives, which show that these compounds preferentially bind at high pH (and often to a catalytically inactive species), it is pertinent to re-examine the behavior of tetrahydrooxazine 1 and its derivatives 2–4 over a range of experimental conditions. Kinetic Analysis of the Binding of a Range of Tetrahydrooxazine Derivatives—The dependence of kcat/Km and 1/Ki upon pH was measured at low substrate concentration (<<Km) by substrate depletion using 2,4-dinitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside as substrate for TmGH1 and 2,4-dinitrophenyl β-lactoside as substrate for Cel5A. For both enzymes, a bell-shaped profile with an optimum at approximately pH 5.8–6 for kcat/Km was observed (Fig. 3). The acidic and basic limbs of these pH profiles display pKa values of 5.3 and 7.0 for TmGH1 and 4.7 and 7.3 for Cel5A, respectively. Based upon past examples (such as Refs. 10Zechel D.L. Boraston A.B. Gloster T. Boraston C.M. Macdonald J.M. Tilbrook D.M.G. Stick R.V. Davies G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14313-14323Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 24Varrot A. Tarling C.A. Macdonald J. Stick R.V. Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Davies G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 7496-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and direct observation by NMR spectroscopy (25McIntosh L.P. Hand G. Johnson P.E. Joshi M.D. Körner M. Plesniak L.A. Ziser L. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9958-9966Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the simplest interpretation of these pH profiles is that they reflect titration of the nucleophile and acid/base, respectively. Our initial experiments first sought to determine the optimal tetrahydrooxazine derivative for pH and structural studies on Cel5A. Ki values were obtained for Cel5A with 1–4 (Table I), which were measured at the pH optimum (6.0) for catalysis. Compound 1 inhibits Cel5A poorly, as would be expected for an enzyme that optimally binds extended substrates in multiple subsites. The greatest inhibition occurs with polysaccharide chains containing either three or four sugar moieties, which exhibit Ki values around 0.5 μm. Inhibition of compound 3 is shown to be competitive; however there is some deviation from linearity in the Dixon plot for the “tetrasaccharide” 4, which most likely indicates partial hydrolysis of the inhibitor, consistent with tetrasaccharides being substrates for this enzyme (12Davies G.J. Dauter M. Brzozowski A.M. Bjørnvad M.E. Andersen K.V. Schülein M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1926-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The “trisaccharide” 3 was thus used for further studies of Ki as a function of pH, and compounds 2 and 3 for subsequent crystallographic analysis.Table IKi values for Cel5A with a number of inhibitors derived from tetrahydrooxazine at pH 6.0InhibitorKiμm11900 ± 100250 ± 1.430.52 ± 0.0340.36 ± 0.06 Open table in a new tab The pH dependence of 1/Ki for TmGH1 with 1 (Fig. 3a) yields a bell-shaped profile, very close to that observed for catalysis but with a slight acidic shift relative to enzyme activity, with a pH optimum at 5.8 and acidic and basic limbs displaying pKa values of 5.1 and 6.7, respectively. Inhibition of Cel5A (Fig. 3b) with 3 likewise shows a bell-shaped profile close to that observed for kcat/Km, but this time with a slight alkaline shift relative to enzyme activity, giving a pH optimum of 6.2 and displaying acidic and basic limb pKa values of 5.1 and 7.4. The pH dependence of 1/Ki, in both systems, differs from many seen previously for aza sugars (10Zechel D.L. Boraston A.B. Gloster T. Boraston C.M. Macdonald J.M. Tilbrook D.M.G. Stick R.V. Davies G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14313-14323Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Varrot A. Tarling C.A. Macdonald J. Stick R.V. Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Davies G.J. J. Am. Chem.

Commun. 2004; : 1794-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as the profile for 1/Ki largely mirrors that seen for kcat/Km. In other words, tetrahydrooxazine 1 and its derivatives bind optimally to the enzymes close to their pH optimum for catalysis. Furthermore, under these optimal pH conditions for catalysis, they bind, in the case of TmGH1, only seven times more weakly than isofagomine 6 and thus appear substantially better inhibitors than suggested from the 500–1000-fold worse binding reported at elevated pH values. The differences in pH behavior reflect two factors. Firstly, they reflect the weak basicity of the nitrogen in 1 in comparison to 6; the pKa of 1 has been reported as 3.6 when compared to 8.6 for 6 (23Bach P. Bols M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 3461-3464Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This means that for the entire pH activity profile measured, the protonation state of 1 is unlikely to change. Secondly, and in marked contrast to the isofagomine derivatives, the profiles suggest that the tetrahydrooxazine derivatives do not bind optimally to a catalytically inactive species where both catalytic residues are in their carboxylate forms. The pH profiles show that the tetrahydrooxazine derivatives most likely bind to a catalytic center containing one protonated and one deprotonated carboxylate (although one cannot formally say which residue is present in which state). Given that under optimal catalytic conditions tetrahydrooxazine derivatives are actually rather good glycosidase inhibitors, the three-dimensional structures of TmGH1 (with 1) and Cel5A (with 2 and 3) were determined to shed light on the protein-inhibitor interactions. Structural Analysis—X-ray diffraction data for TmGH1 in complex with 1 were collected to 2.0 Å resolution (Table II). The model was refined to a final Rcryst of 0.20 and Rfree of 0.26. TmGH1 folds as a (β/α)8 barrel with the catalytic acid/base (Glu-166) on strand β-4 and the nucleophile (Glu-351) on strand β-7 (Fig. 1a) (10Zechel D.L. Boraston A.B. Gloster T. Boraston C.M.

Axin promotes phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β, and the phosphorylated form of β-catenin is then recognized by β-TrCP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and destroyed by a ubiquitination-proteasome-dependent pathway. However, in the presence of a Wnt signal, the phosphorylation of β-catenin is blocked, allowing it to escape destruction and accumulate in the cytoplasm. Stabilized cytoplasmic β-catenin is translocated into nuclei and interacts with high mobility group box transcription factors of the Tcf/LEF family, leading to induction of specific target genes such as c-myc or cyclin D1. Uncontrolled expression of these cell cycle-related genes is generally considered an important mechanism for tumorigenesis due to overactivation of a Wnt signal (Refs. 9Kikuchi A. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar and 13van Es J.H. Barker N. Clevers H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar and references therein). Cancer cells carrying mutations in the APC gene have high levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin (14van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D. Haramis A.P. Tjon-Pon-Fong M. Moerer P. van den Born M. Soete G. Pals S. Eilers M. Medema R. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Since APC can form a complex with β-catenin and exogenous expression of APC reduces the cytoplasmic level of β-catenin, APC is considered a negative regulator of the Wnt pathway (15Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). While the mechanism for the down-regulation of β-catenin by Axin is well understood as described above (10Fagotto F. Jho E. Zeng L. Kurth T. Joos T. Kaufmann C. Costantini F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), the biochemical mechanism for down-regulation of β-catenin by APC is unclear. However, recent findings suggesting a role of APC in shuttling β-catenin from the nucleus may provide another explanation for the tumorigenic effects of mutations in APC (17Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 18Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Although it is still controversial whether APC contains real nuclear export sequences, it has been claimed that truncation of APC abolishes specific nuclear export sequences, which blocks the APC-dependent export of β-catenin from the nucleus, resulting in constitutive activation of downstream target genes, which leads to tumor formation (19Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Cliffe A. Brabletz T. Bienz M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The levels of key regulatory proteins that are involved in cell cycle regulation (cyclins, Sic1, p27, etc.), Wnt signaling (β-catenin), and NFκB signaling (IκBα) are controlled in part by ubiquitination-proteasome-mediated degradation (Refs. 20Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome Biol. 2000; (http://genomebiology.com/2000/1/5/REVIEWS/3002)PubMed Google Scholar and 21Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar and references therein). In a series of enzymatic reactions, free ubiquitin is first activated by linkage between activating enzyme E1 in an ATP-dependent manner, and the activated ubiquitin is then transferred to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Finally E2 transfers ubiquitin to a ubiquitin ligase (E3), which catalyzes linkage of ubiquitin to a lysine residue of the target protein. Repeated cycles of this process result in formation of a polyubiquitinated target protein, which is recognized by the 26 S proteasome and rapidly degraded into short peptides. It has been shown that the levels of several proteins involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling pathway, such as Axin, APC, and β-catenin, are controlled at a post-transcriptional level. However, it is not known whether the ubiquitination-proteasome-mediated pathway controls the level of APC or Axin. In the studies reported here, we show that APC is down-regulated by a direct ubiquitination-proteasome-mediated pathway and that Wnt signaling can inhibit the process. The APC, stabilized upon Wnt3a treatment, accumulates in nuclei. We identify the domain of APC responsible for this process. Our data also suggest an unexpected role for Axin, facilitation of the ubiquitination-proteasome-mediated destruction of APC through the oligomerization of Axin. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of the protein level of APC upon Wnt3a treatment and a cross-regulation between APC and Axin. Construction of Plasmids—Full-length Xenopus VSV-G epitopetagged APC and Myc-epitope tagged Axin and deletion constructs and pCS2MT-GFP have been described previously (10Fagotto F. Jho E. Zeng L. Kurth T. Joos T. Kaufmann C. Costantini F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Myc epitope-tagged human APC constructs and several deletion constructs (human APC2 (hAPC2), hAPC21, and hAPC25) were kindly provided by Dr. P. Polakis (22Vleminckx K. Wong E. Guger K. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). hAPC-(1–733), hAPC-(1–1038), hAPC-(331–1337), hAPC-(733–1337), and hAPC-(960–1337) were constructed by using routine molecular biology techniques. Myc epitope was tagged to the N terminus of all constructs. PCMV-HA-Ub expression construct was a gift from Dr. D. Bohmann (23Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). HA epitope-tagged human GSK3β/kinase-dead human GSK3β and FLAG epitope-tagged mouse Dvl-1 were obtained from Dr. J. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada) and Dr. J. Kitajewski (Columbia University), respectively. Site-directed mutations were introduced by standard PCR techniques using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The reading frame of all constructs and introduction of site-directed mutations were confirmed by sequencing and detection of expected sized bands in Western blot. Plasmids for transfection were isolated using the midiprep kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human kidney epithelial cell line 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories Inc.) and gentamycin. For transfection experiments, each plasmid DNA was applied by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by the addition of an appropriate amount of empty expression vector. The calpain inhibitors N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methional (ALLM) and proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 were purchased from Sigma. Blotting of APC—20–30 μg of total cell lysates were separated by 4.5–5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mm CAPS buffer (pH 11.1) containing 0.01% SDS for overnight at 4 °C (100–150 mA). Antibodies for Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Proteins were detected with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescence Plus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10, Oncogene Research Products), anti-VSV monoclonal antibody (Roche Diagnostics), anti-GSK3β monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Diagnostics), anti-APC polyclonal antibody (APC(C-20), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Axin antibody (kindly provided by Dr. P. Polakis), anti-lamin A antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), and anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) were used. Preparation of Conditioned Media—To obtain the conditioned medium (CM) from the culture of Wnt3a-producing L cells (kindly provided by Dr. R. Nusse), these cells were cultured in 175T flask containing DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When these cells were 50% subconfluent, medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM and continuously cultured for 18 h. The CM was harvested, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and concentrated using Centricon Plus-20 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). CM derived from L cells that had been transfected with PGK-neo was used as a control for Wnt3a-conditioned medium. Reverse Transcription-PCR with Real Time Quantification—Total RNA was extracted from 293T cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription-PCR with real time quantification was carried out using the iCycler iQ™ real time detection system (Bio-Rad) as follows. 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR was carried out with the following primers: for hAPC, 5′-CTCTCTGAGTTCTCTCAGTG-3′ and 5′-AGACCATGTTCTGAATCTGG-3′; for Axin2, 5′-ACTTTCCTGGAGAGGGAG-3′ and 5′-GCTGGTGCAAAGACATAGCC-3′; for β-actin,5′-AGGCCAACCGCGAGAAGATGACC-3′ and 5′-GAAGTCCAGGGCGACGTAGCAC-3′. PCR amplifications included SYBR green (iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). All samples were run in triplicate. The specificity of the amplification reactions was confirmed by melting curve analysis and subsequently by agarose gel electrophoresis. The threshold cycle (Ct) value for each gene was normalized to the Ct value for β-actin. The level of mRNA in the Wnt3a-CM-treated cells was compared with that in the L cell (L)-CM-treated cells, and the relative mRNA expression was calculated by using the formula: 2-ΔΔCtt where ΔCt = Ct APC or Axin2 - Ct β-actin and ΔΔCt = ΔCt Wnt3a-CM - ΔCt L-CM. Pulse-Chase Analysis—Myc-tagged hAPC- and HA-ubiquitin-expressing plasmids were transiently transfected into 293T cells in 60-mm dishes. At 16 h after transfection, cells were starved for 60 min in methionine- and cysteine-free medium and then labeled for 1 h with 0.1 mCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The labeling medium was replaced with cold medium, and cells were incubated for 0, 2, or 4 h. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors at the indicated times. The lysates were subjected to anti-Myc immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Preparation of Nuclear Extract—Nuclear extracts were prepared from control and Wnt3a-CM-treated 293T cells. After treatment for 24 h, medium was replaced with the serum-free DMEM. Cells were harvested 0, 2, 4, and 8 h after changing the medium and processed using a modified protocol according to Dennler et al. (24Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). Briefly confluent cells from 100-mm dishes were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.7, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) on ice for 15 min to swell. Subsequently the cells were lysed by 30 strokes of a Dounce all glass homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by brief centrifugation and resuspended in 150 μl of cold buffer C (buffer A (0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline), 420 mm NaCl, and 20% glycerol). The nuclear membrane was ruptured by 15 strokes of a Dounce all glass homogenizer, and the lysates were incubated on ice for 60 min with tapping. The lysates were aliquoted and frozen at –80 °C. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells (1.5 × 105) were plated in four chamber slides and allowed to achieve about 60% confluency. Cells were treated with Wnt3a-conditioned or control medium for 24 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, and subsequently permeabilized and blocked with buffer A at room temperature for 15 min. The subsequent incubation was carried out with buffer A, and all washes were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Cells were incubated with anti-APC monoclonal antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated horse anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:200, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. After extensive washing, the slides were mounted in a drop of Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polyscience Inc., Warrington, PA) to reduce photobleaching. Signal was visualized by epifluorescence using a confocal laser scanning microscopy (MRC1024, Bio-Rad). The Level of APC Is Up-regulated by Wnt3a—A previous study demonstrated that the expression of Wnt-1 resulted in an increased steady-state level of APC protein as well as an increase in the amount of β-catenin and suggested that APC might be regulated by Wnt-1 at the post-translational level in a fashion similar to β-catenin (25Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In the present study, we first investigated the effect of Wnt3a on the level of endogenous APC protein. The level of endogenous APC was increased by 2.13 ± 0.15-fold in 293T cells treated with Wnt3a-conditioned medium compared with cells treated with control medium. In 293T cells transfected transiently with Myc-tagged hAPC plasmid and treated with Wnt3a-CM, the level of exogenous hAPC protein was increased by 1.86 ± 0.14-fold compared with control (Fig. 1A). In contrast to APC, the level of endogenous Axin was decreased by treatment with Wnt3a-CM (Fig. 1A, 1.72 ± 0.11-fold reduction) as shown previously (26Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 27Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Kishida M. Ikeda S. Takada S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10681-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Treatment with Wnt3a-CM or co-transfection of APC did not change the level of GSK3β, and the level of GSK3β was used as a control for even loading in subsequent experiments (Fig. 1A). Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed that the level of endogenous APC mRNA was unchanged, while Axin2, which is known to be a target gene by Wnt/β-catenin signaling (28Jho E.H. Zhang T. Domon C. Joo C.K. Freund J.N. Costantini F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 29Leung J.Y. Kolligs F.T. Wu R. Zhai Y. Kuick R. Hanash S. Cho K.R.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1184-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), was enhanced by treatment with Wnt3a-CM (Fig. 1B, 0.995 ± 0.10 for APC and 1.83 ± 0.22 for Axin 2). This suggests that Wnt3a may modulate the level of APC at a post-transcriptional level. Ectopic expression of Dvl-1, GSK3β, or kinase-dead GSK3β or treatment with the specific GSK3β inhibitor LiCl did not cause any changes at the level of APC in 293T cells (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the regulation of APC by Wnt may use mechanisms other than the well studied Wnt-Dvl-GSK3β pathway. Down-regulation of APC Is Mediated by the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway—The increased level of APC upon Wnt-3a treatment led us to suspect that APC, like β-catenin, may be down-regulated by the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway in the absence of Wnt signaling. To test this possibility, HA-tagged ubiquitin was transiently expressed in 293T cells along with either Myc-tagged full-length hAPC or VSV-tagged full-length Xenopus APC (xAPC). Interestingly the protein level of hAPC (Fig. 2A) and xAPC (data not shown) was dramatically decreased (about 4-fold) by co-transfection with ubiquitin, whereas the level of transfected GFP protein was unchanged. The peptides ALLN (calpain inhibitor I) and MG132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-aldehyde) have been widely used to inhibit the 26 S proteasome (31Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 32Melman L. Geuze H.J. Li Y. McCormick L.M. Van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3325-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ALLM (calpain inhibitor II) is structurally related to ALLN but does not inhibit the proteasome (33Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). The reduction of hAPC level by co-transfection of ubiquitin was partially blocked by the treatment with ALLN or MG132 (Fig. 2B). However, treatment with ALLM or the protease inhibitor leupeptin did not block ubiquitin-mediated down-regulation of APC (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 5). Increasing the amount of the transfected ubiquitin further reduced the protein levels of hAPC and xAPC in the presence of ALLM, while this reduction was blocked by treatment with ALLN (Fig. 2C and data not shown for xAPC). However, the protein level of transfected GFP was unaffected by the amount of transfected ubiquitin (data not shown). The down-regulation of hAPC was blocked by as little as 1 h of pretreatment with ALLN, and the extent of blocking was enhanced by 2 h of ALLN pretreatment (Fig. 2D). [35S]Methionine metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments, which showed that the addition of ALLN stabilized APC protein considerably compared with the cells treated with ALLM, further confirmed that the proteasome is involved in the down-regulation of hAPC (Fig. 2E). From these data, we conclude that the ubiquitination-proteasome-mediated pathway can regulate the protein level of APC. Because the APC level is down-regulated by co-transfection of ubiquitin but enhanced by Wnt3a-CM treatment, we wondered whether the effect of Wnt3a was due to an inhibition of the ubiquitin-mediated down-regulation of APC. To test this idea, 293T cells, co-transfected with hAPC and ubiquitin, were treated with Wnt3a-CM immediately after transfection. As shown in Fig. 2F, this treatment significantly blocked ubiquitin-mediated down-regulation of APC (1.2-fold reduction instead of 4-fold), whereas control conditioned medium had no effect. To determine whether Wnt3a signaling blocks the ubiquitination process on hAPC, the following experiments were performed. 293T cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged full-length hAPC and HA-tagged ubiquitin, and lysates from the transfected cells were subjected to anti-Myc immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. Smeared high molecular weight forms of APC protein and enhancement of the intensity of the signal when the cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor ALLN were detected (Fig. 2G, lanes 1 and 2; further study for direct ubiquitination on APC is described below (Fig. 4)). These results imply that hAPC is directly ubiquitinated, and the enhanced signal upon ALLN treatment might be due to blocking of proteasomal degradation, which causes an increased level of ubiquitinated APC. The signal below the intact transfected APC might originate from the incomplete blocking of APC degradation by ALLN (Fig. 2G, **). Most importantly, Wnt3a treatment caused a reduction of the signal for the smeared high molecular weight forms of APC protein (Fig. 2G, *). This suggests that Wnt signaling inhibits the process of direct ubiquitination on APC (Fig. 2G, compare lanes 2 and 3). Overall our data suggest that the level of APC protein is regulated by a ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated pathway and that Wnt signaling causes inhibition of APC ubiquitination, leading to an increase in the APC level. Identification of the Domain Responsible for the Down-regulation of APC—APC is a large (∼ 300-kDa) protein with diverse domains and motifs responsible for interactions with other proteins (Fig. 3A). The N-terminal region of APC is known to be involved in the homo-oligomerization of APC (34Joslyn G. Richardson D.S. White R. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11109-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). APC contains seven repeated armadillo motifs, which show homology to the Drosophila β-catenin homolog armadillo. These armadillo motifs and a basic motif interact with the kinesin superfamily (KIF) proteins and microtubules, respectively, suggesting a role of APC in the regulation of cytoskeleton (Ref. 9Kikuchi A. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar and references therein). Three 15-amino acids repeats and seven 20-amino acids repeats are domains for interaction with β-catenin (35Su L.K. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 36Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5549-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Most APC mutations associated with tumorigenesis cause truncation of five of seven 20-amino acid repeats, suggesting that the 20-amino acid repeats confer the ability to down-regulate β-catenin (Ref. 37Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). The C-terminal end of APC includes a domain that interacts with the homolog of Drosophila discs large protein, which is a known tumor suppressor (38Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1996; 272: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). To identify the domain of APC responsible for its down-regulation, several hAPC mutant constructs were co-transfected in 293T cells together with HA-tagged ubiquitin. Initially the available three mutant forms of hAPC were used (22Vleminckx K. Wong E. Guger K. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Full-length hAPC and the mutant forms hAPC2 and hAPC21 were clearly down-regulated by co-transfection with ubiquitin, while mutant APC25 was not (Fig. 3A). Comparison of all four constructs suggested that amino acids 1034–1337 of APC might be responsible for its down-regulation by ubiquitin. Consistent with this idea, ubiquitination-mediated down-regulation of APC was completely blocked in mutants missing this region (Fig. 3B). In contrast, two mutants lacking the known APC oligomerization domain (34Joslyn G. Richardson D.S. White R. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11109-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) remained sensitive to down-regulation by ubiquitin, suggesting that the oligomerization domain of APC is not involved in this process (Fig. 3B). hAPC-(733–1337), which is missing most of the armadillo repeat domain (2Fearnhead N.S. Britton M.P. Bodmer W.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and hAPC-(960–1337) were still down-regulated (Fig. 3B). There was no effect of ubiquitin on the protein level of GFP co-transfected with each of the APC constructs, showing that the reduction in the levels of certain APC constructs is not due to differential efficiency of transfection (Fig. 3B). Overall the experimental data with deletion constructs suggest that the region of APC including amino acids 1034–1337 is necessary for the ubiquitination-proteasome-mediated down-regulation of APC. Direct Ubiquitination on APC—To determine whether APC is directly ubiquitinated, the same approach described above was used (Fig. 2G). Immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody using lysates from 293T cells that were co-transfected with Myc-tagged full-length hAPC and HA-tagged ubiquitin showed smeared high molecular weight bands, whose intensity was enhanced by proteasome-specific inhibitor (Fig. 4,"
https://openalex.org/W1992577956,"Etk/Bmx, a member of the Tec family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, has been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, motility, and apoptosis. Here, we report the identification of Tec family kinases as the potential interacting proteins of the tumor suppressor p53 by an Src homology 3 domain array screening. Etk is physically associated with p53 through its Src homology 3 domain and the proline-rich domain of p53. Induction of p53 expression by DNA damage inhibits Etk activity in several cell types. Down-regulation of Etk expression by a specific small interfering RNA sensitizes prostate cancer cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that inhibition of Etk activity is required for apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We also show that Etk primarily interacts with p53 in the cytoplasm and that such interaction leads to bidirectional inhibition of the activities of both proteins. Overexpression of Etk in prostate cancer cells results in inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity and its interaction with the mitochondrial protein BAK and confers the resistance to doxorubicin. Therefore, we propose that the stoichiometry between p53 and the Tec family kinases in a given cell type may determine its sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2023329023,"Members of the Oxa1p/Alb3/YidC family mediate the insertion of various organelle or bacterial hydrophobic proteins into membranes. They present at least five transmembrane segments (TM) linked by hydrophilic domains located on both sides of the membrane. To examine how Oxa1p structure relates to its function, we have introduced point mutations and large deletions into various domains of the yeast mitochondrial protein. These mutants allowed us to show the importance of the first TM domain as well as a synergistic interaction between the first loop and the C-terminal tail, which both protrude into the matrix. These mutants also led to the isolation of a high copy suppressor, OMS1, which encodes a member of the methyltransferase family. Overexpression of OMS1 seems to increase the steady-state level of both the mutant and wild-type Oxa1p. We show that Oms1p is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein inserted independently of Oxa1p. Oms1p presents one TM and a N-in C-out topology with the C-terminal domain carrying the methyltransferase-like domain. A conserved motif within this domain is essential for the suppression of oxa1 mutations. We discuss the possible role of Oms1p on Oxa1p intermembrane space domain.

Mitochondria are organelles that are essential for numerous metabolic reactions, including the oxidative phosphorylations that provide non-photosynthetic eukaryotic cells with their major source of ATP. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains the respiratory chain complexes and ATP synthase as well as numerous other proteins, such as transporters and translocators. This extremely high protein content makes the mitochondrial inner membrane a good model system to study how hydrophobic proteins from different origins can reach their final destination and acquire their proper topology and their assembly partners in a lipid bilayer. Most of the proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm and imported into the mitochondrial membrane are dependent on the Tom and Tim translocases from the outer and inner membranes (for review see Ref. 1Wiedemann N.

Other factors are necessary to ensure the correct insertion of the small number of respiratory complex subunits that are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and inserted within the inner membrane. First, at least in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, specific translational activators bound to the membrane recognize the 5′-untranslated leaders of most mitochondrial mRNAs and probably contribute to localize mitochondrial translation in the vicinity of the membrane, facilitating subsequent membrane integration of the newly synthetized peptides (2Sanchirico M.E. Fox T.D. Mason T.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5796-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The modulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis can also promote its coupling with membrane insertion (3Bonnefoy N. Bsat N. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2359-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Second, in eukaryotic mitochondria, Oxa1p is an important inner membrane component mediating membrane insertion of mitochondrial proteins and the export of some domains that have to be translocated into the intermembrane space. In particular, Oxa1p could be crucial for the insertion and lateral exit of mildly hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; ORF, open reading frame; L, loop. segments (4Saint-Georges Y. Hamel P. Lemaire C. Dujardin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13814-13819Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and for the translocation of charged soluble domains (5Herrmann J.M. Bonnefoy N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2507-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Oxa1p is functionally conserved in higher eukaryotes (6Bonnefoy N. Kermorgant M.

Plant J. 1997; 12: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the Oxa1p family extends far beyond eukaryotic mitochondria because members are present in both bacteria, such as YidC, and chloroplast (8Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Kuhn A. Stuart R. Henry R. Dalbey R.E.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the yeast S. cerevisiae, the deletion of the OXA1 gene prevents respiratory growth because it impairs the biogenesis of the three respiratory complexes of dual genetic origin, cytochrome c oxidase being the most affected (11Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12Altamura N. Capitanio N. Bonnefoy N. Papa S. Dujardin G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In particular Oxa1p seems essential for the co-translational insertion of Cox2p, which is encoded by the mitochondrial genome and the export of its soluble domain within the intermembrane space (13He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, YidC interacts with the Sec system to function as a membrane insertase. In particular, YidC is required for the insertion of ATPase subunits (9Kuhn A. Stuart R. Henry R. Dalbey R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 510-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10537-10544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis chloroplasts, the Alb3 protein mediates the insertion of the light antenna complexes into the thylakoid membrane (20Moore M. Goforth R.L. Mori H. Henry R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The Chlamydomonas Alb3 is also required for efficient assembly of photosystem II (21Ossenbuhl F. Gohre V. Meurer J. Krieger-Liszkay A. Rochaix J.D. Eichacker L.A. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1790-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The Oxa1p, YidC, and Alb3 proteins share modest sequence homology but show a conserved structure with five or six TM segments interrupted with hydrophilic loops located on either side of the membrane (22Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Yen M.R. Harley K.T. Tseng Y.H. Saier Jr., M.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YidC contains six TM domains, and both its C and N termini are located in the cytoplasm. In eukaryotes, Oxa1p-type proteins show a N-out C-in topology (24Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and five TM domains with a long basic C-terminal tail. In an effort to analyze the domains of Oxa1p and to examine how its structure relates to its function and the interaction with its substrates, we have introduced point mutations and large deletions into various domains of the protein that are located in the membrane, the intermembrane space, or the matrix. We find that mutating two TM residues specific to the eukaryotic members of the family specifically affects cytochrome c oxidase activity. In addition, the two matrix regions of Oxa1p appear dispensable independently but their simultaneous removal causes a severe respiratory deficiency. These mutants led to the isolation of a high copy suppressor, OMS1, which encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane protein of the methyltransferase family. The suppression mechanism has been investigated, and its functional implications are discussed. 1. Strains, Media, and Genetic Techniques—All of the strains were derived from the W303 nuclear background MATα ade2–1 ura3–1 his3–11,15 trp1–1 leu2–3,112 can1–100. CW04 is the wild-type strain (11Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), NBT1 is the oxa1::LEU2 strain (6Bonnefoy N. Kermorgant M. Groudinsky O. Minet M. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11978-11982Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and NBT3 is the oxa1Δ::URA3 strain (12Altamura N. Capitanio N. Bonnefoy N. Papa S. Dujardin G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The thermosensitive strain (oxa1-ts1402) (25Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in which leucine 240 of Oxa1p is substituted by serine was constructed by K. Hell and R. A. Stuart. The Δmba1 strain was from J. M. Herrmann. The Δafg3 strain (afg3::HIS3) was from A. Tzagoloff. Media and genetic techniques were as described previously (11Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). 2. Subcloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The 3-kb SacI KpnI fragment containing the OXA1 ORF was subcloned into the same sites of pRS416, a centromeric plasmid (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to yield pNB160. Mutant DNA fragments were obtained by two-step PCR as described previously (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). In mutant WW→AA, codons 128–129 (TGG TGG) were replaced by GCA GCT, creating both a PstI and a PvuII site with the flanking wild-type nucleotide. Codon 140 (CGA) encoding arginine was changed to GCA (alanine), creating an HpaI site, or to GAA (glutamate). Codons 332 and 353 were changed from AAA (lysine) to the stop codon TAA, and codon 376 was altered from TTA (leucine) to GTA. Simultaneously, a NcoI, HpaI, or SpeI site was created downstream stop codon 332, 353, or 376, respectively. Deletion of the 43 codons of L1 created an HpaI site. Deletion of L2 or TM4–5 removed 25 and 33 codons, respectively. Mutant OXA1 fragments were subcloned into pNB160 using various restriction sites located throughout the OXA1 ORF. All of the plasmids generated were verified by sequencing the regions coming from PCR amplification and the cloning junctions. For some mutants, the SacI KpnI 3-kb fragment was subcloned into the high copy URA3 vector YEp352 (28Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). 3. Homologous Recombination—The oxa1 mutations were integrated into the genome. However, as the different C-terminal truncations showed a similar phenotype on plasmid, only the largest one, K332*, was chosen for homologous integration into the yeast genome. The resulting oxa1 mutation was identical to that carried by the oxa11–331 mutant used by Szyrach et al. (16Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). SacI KpnI linear fragments containing the mutated OXA1 genes were mixed with a circular LEU2 vector (Yep351) (28Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) and used to transform the oxa1Δ::URA3 strain NBT3. [Leu+] transformants were selected and replica-plated onto medium containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid, which is toxic in [Ura+] cells, to screen for [Leu+] [Ura–] clones. The phenotype of each recombinant strain was similar to that of a Δoxa1 strain expressing the corresponding mutant gene from a centromeric plasmid. The structure of the OXA1 locus was confirmed by PCR analysis and sequencing for each strain. 4. Library Screening—Mutant WW→AA was transformed with a high copy library constructed by F. Lacroute into the URA3 2 μ vector pFL44L. [Ura+] clones were selected and replica-plated onto glycerol medium at 36 °C. Total yeast genomic DNA was extracted from three co-segregating slow-growing [Gly+] clones and used to transform E. coli cells to recover the plasmids. Molecular analysis by restriction enzymes and sequencing showed that two plasmids were carrying truncations of OXA1 itself and that the last one, pNB212, contained a new chromosome IV insert carrying the YDR316w/OMS1 gene. 5. Mutagenesis of OMS1—A 1.76-kb SacI SphI fragment containing OMS1 was excised from a deletion derivative of pNB212 (Fig. 3A, line 6) and subcloned into the same sites of vector Yep352 (28Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). This new plasmid, pNB229, still carried the suppressor activity and contained two XbaI sites 554 bp apart surrounding the third methyltransferase motif coding region of OMS1 (motif II, see Fig. 6A). A PCR primer was designed that contained the first XbaI site and a modified motif II coding region. Codon 326, which was coding for aspartate, was changed from GAT to GCA (alanine). In addition, the following codon was altered from ACT (threonine) to TCT (serine), which allowed the creation of a NsiI while still coding a hydroxylated amino acid at position 327. Previous studies have shown that this position did not matter for the methyltransferase activity (29Takata Y. Konishi K. Gomi T. Fujioka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5537-5542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mutated version of the XbaI 554-bp fragment was generated by PCR amplification and subcloned in-frame into the XbaI sites of pNB229 to replace the wild-type fragment. In this new plasmid, pNB230, the expected mutation was verified by the presence of the NsiI site followed by sequencing of the cloned XbaI fragment and junctions.Fig. 6Involvement of Oms1p methyltransferase domain in the suppression of oxa1-ΔL1-K332*.A, Oms1p is depicted with its four conserved methyltransferase motifs, I, post-I, II, and III (white bars). The sequence of the motifs is given in the one-letter code, and the numbers refer to the number of residues in between the motifs. Residues or spaces are boxed in gray when they fulfill the consensus found by Niewmierzycka and Clarke (43Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the Oms1p-AS variant, the widely conserved Asp326 and the loosely conserved Thr237 have been modified to Ala and Ser respectively. B, high copy plasmids producing the wild-type Oms1p or the mutant version Oms1p-AS as well as the control vector Yep352 have been transformed into the ΔL1-K332* mutant. Transformants were patched on selective glucose medium (Glc), replica-plated onto non-fermentable plates (Eth/Gly), and incubated at 28 °C for 4 days. C, the ΔL1-K332* mutant was transformed with plasmids overexpressing either the untagged OMS1 gene or c-Myc-tagged versions of the wild type (OMS1-c-Myc) or mutant gene (OMS1-AS-c-Myc). Purified mitochondrial proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-c-Myc or anti-Atp2p antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) 6. Epitope Tagging and Deletion of OMS1—Oms1p was tagged by fusing the c-Myc epitope at the last residue (amino acid 471) using PCR fragments containing 41 and 43 bp homologous to OMS1 on the 5′ and 3′ sides of the c-myc-HIS3 cassette (30Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). The PCR fragment was introduced into a wild-type strain, either untransformed or carrying the pNB212, pNB229, or pNB230 OMS1 plasmids to integrate the c-Myc construct either in the yeast genome or in the plasmid. Correct integration of the tag in the OMS1 ORF was confirmed both on genomic and on plasmidic DNA by PCR amplification and sequencing. The genomic version of OMS1 was deleted using a KanR PCR fragment that contains 50 bp of the OMS1-flanking regions on each side. The integration was confirmed by PCR analysis of the genomic DNA, and the [G418R] phenotype was shown to segregate 2:2 and to correlate with the presence of the disrupted version of OMS1. 7. Mitochondria Purification, Western Blotting, Determination of Respiratory Complex Activities, and 35S Labeling—Cells were grown either in complete or minimal galactose medium, and mitochondria were purified as described previously (31Kermorgant M. Bonnefoy N. Dujardin G. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Swelling and protease K treatment of mitochondria were carried out as described previously (32Funes S. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane and hybridization with various antibodies: anti-Cox2p and anti-porin (Molecular Probes); anti-cytochrome c1 (raised in our laboratory against a fusion protein ProA-apocytochrome c1 expressed in E. coli); anti-Atp2p and anti-Atp4p (J. Velours); anti-c-Myc (J. M. Galan); and anti-Arg8p (T. D. Fox). Immunodetection was carried out using the standard chemiluminescence method. To measure the cytochrome c oxidase activity, the oxidation of previously reduced cytochrome c was followed spectrophotometrically at 550 nm according to Pajot (33Pajot P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Ubiquinol cytochrome c oxidase activity (bc1 activity) was measured according to Brasseur et al. (34Brasseur G. Coppee J. Colson A.-M. Brivet-Chevillotte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29356-29364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity was measured by colorimetric determination of inorganic phosphate released from ATP according to Spannagel et al. (35Spannagel C. Vaillier J. Chaignepain S. Velours J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 35S labeling of mitochondrial proteins was performed on whole cells in the presence of cycloheximide that specifically blocks cytoplasmic translation as described by Lemaire et al. (36Lemaire C. Hamel P. Velours J. Dujardin G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23471-23475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 1. Mutations in Different Domains of Oxa1p Lead to Different Respiratory Growth Phenotypes—To investigate the function of the different domains of Oxa1p, mutations were created in the gene on a centromeric plasmid using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis strategy and then integrated at the chromosomal OXA1 locus (Fig. 1A). First, missense mutations were introduced in or close to the sequences encoding the first hydrophobic segment TM1. The pair of tryptophans 128–129, specific to eukaryotic Oxa1p/Alb3p-type sequences, was changed to a pair of alanines (WW→AA), whereas the basic arginine 140 adjacent to TM1 was substituted by either the neutral alanine (R140A) or the acidic glutamate residue (R140E). Second, nonsense mutations were placed in the 3′ end of OXA1 to generate three different truncations of the C-terminal tail of Oxa1p (K332*, K353*, and K376*). Third, large deletions were made within loop 1 (ΔL1) or loop 2 (ΔL2) or by fusing loop 3 to the C-terminal tail to eliminate TM4 and TM5 (ΔTM4–5). The phenotypes of these various mutants were analyzed on respiratory media containing different non-fermentable carbon sources (ethanol/glycerol/lactate), which cannot sustain growth of the null mutant Δoxa1 (Fig. 1B). The missense mutations WW→AA in TM1 led to a very strict thermosensitive and slightly cryosensitive phenotype on non-fermentable medium, whereas modification of Arg140 (R→E, R→A) only conferred a cryosensitive phenotype on lactate medium. Similar to the Δoxa1 mutant, ΔL2 and ΔTM4–5 did not grow at all on these non-fermentable media. ΔL1 and the truncations of the C-terminal tail of Oxa1p were indistinguishable from the wild type at 28 °C, although K332* showed some weak sensitivity to either high or low temperatures. It was striking that ΔL1 and K332* gave mild phenotypes while deleting such large matrix parts of the protein, so we constructed a double mutant ΔL1-K332* by combining both matrix mutations. This ΔL1-K332* mutant does not grow on non-fermentable medium. 2. Effect of the Various Mutations on the Steady-state Level of Oxa1p and on the Assembly of the Respiratory Complexes—The mutants were subjected to biochemical analysis to determine both the steady state-level and size of the Oxa1p variants and the effect on respiratory complex biogenesis. With the exception of ΔL2 in which the Oxa1p protein was repeatedly undetectable, the mutated Oxa1p could be detected in purified mitochondrial extracts in all of the other mutants but always in lower steady-state levels than in the wild type (Fig. 2A). We could find no correlation between the levels of Oxa1p variants and either the nature of the mutation or the strength of the phenotype. Rather Oxa1p levels seemed extremely sensitive to any type of mutation. This could be due to the fact that Oxa1p is known to facilitate its own insertion (37Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and is very sensitive to proteases (38Kaser M. Kambacheld M. Kisters-Woike B. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46414-46423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For all of the mutants, the observed size of the Oxa1p variants was compatible with the predicted size. Strikingly, the level of the Oxa1p variant observed in WW→AA was similar whether it was at permissive or restrictive temperature, suggesting that the mutated protein activity rather than its accumulation is affected by high temperature. In addition, the level of the ΔL1-K332* was similar to that of the two single mutants, showing that the large double deletion did not further destabilize Oxa1p. In absence of Oxa1p, the N-tail translocation of the Cox2p precursor into the intermembrane space is blocked (25Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Consequently, the maturation of pre-Cox2p cannot occur and the unprocessed precursor is rapidly degraded. The new mutants were subjected to 35S labeling of the mitochondrial proteins at 28 °C (Fig. 2B). As usual, in this strain background, the cytochrome b labeling signal was stronger when Oxa1p function was affected. 2C. Lemaire, unpublished data. Whereas Cox2p was entirely matured in ΔL1 and K332*, ΔL2 and ΔTM4–5 behaved like Δoxa1 mutants. Interestingly, R→A and WW→AA, which showed wild-type growth on non-fermentable carbon source at 28 °C, were partly defective in pre-Cox2p processing, similarly to ΔL1-K332*, which exhibited a strong respiratory-deficient phenotype. This finding suggests that the respiratory growth deficiency of ΔL1-K332* was due to respiratory chain biogenesis defect that was distinct from pre-Cox2p membrane insertion. The effect of these oxa1 mutations on respiratory complex assembly was further analyzed by combining immunodetection experiments and respiratory enzyme activity measurements on purified mitochondria. First, Western blot analysis of the steady-state level of three representative subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (Cox2p), complex bc1 (Cyt1p), and ATPase (Atp4p) was performed for all of the mutants (Fig. 2A). At 28 °C, R→A, ΔL1, K332*, and WW→AA behaved similarly to the wild type, whereas ΔTM4–5 was similar to the Δoxa1 mutant. ΔL1-K332* grown at 28 °C and WW→AA grown at a restrictive temperature showed an intermediate phenotype. Second, respiratory enzyme activity measurements were performed for the two latter mutants (Table I). ΔL1-K332* exhibited a dramatic 90% decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity and at least a 50% decrease in bc1 and ATPase activities. At restrictive temperature, WW→AA presented a specific defect of cytochrome c oxidase, whereas the ATPase and the bc1 activities were nearly wild type. Thus, all of the biochemical analyses showed that ΔL1-K332* has a pleiotropic phenotype that reflects the requirement of the matrix domains for the biogenesis of the three respiratory complexes, whereas WW→AA specifically affects cytochrome c oxidase formation at high temperature.Table IRespiratory chain enzyme activity in some oxa1 mutantsGrowth temperatureStrainActivities at 28 °CIIIIVV° C28WT100100100WW→AA1048894Δ L1-K332*351050Δoxa11901633WT100100100WW>AA1091784 Open table in a new tab 3. YDR316w/OMS1 Is a High Copy Suppressor of Partial oxa1 Defects That Genetically Interacts with OXA1—Contrary to the Δoxa1 mutant, WW→AA presented spontaneous reversion events of the respiratory deficiency at 36 °C and thus appeared less stringent than Δoxa1. This led us to search for high copy suppressors of WW→AA, even though no high copy suppressors of Δoxa1 had ever been isolated. A genomic library cloned in a high copy vector was introduced into WW→AA cells, and colonies presenting a slow growth phenotype on non-fermentable carbon sources were further analyzed. One of them contained a plasmid carrying a 3.9-kb fragment of chromosome IV that conferred suppression after re-transformation of both the original mutant WW→AA and the ΔL1-K332* mutant but only at 28 °C for ΔL1-K332* (Fig. 3A and data not shown). This 3.9-kb fragment contained two entire ORFs, YDR316w and IPK1/YDR315c, together with the 5′ region of YDR314c. Subcloning and disruption showed that the gene responsible for the suppression was YDR316w, an ORF of unknown function, that we called OMS1 for “Oxa1 Multicopy Suppressor” (Fig. 3A). In theory, Oms1p could compensate only for all/some oxa1 deficiencies or it could generally improve the non-fermentable growth efficiency of many conditional respiratory mutants. To decide between these possibilities, we determined the allele specificity of the suppression. Several oxa1 mutants were transformed with the plasmid carrying OMS1 and tested for growth on glycerol medium at 28 or 36 °C (data not shown). Whereas Δoxa1, ΔL2, or ΔTM4–5 clearly was not suppressed, the mutant oxa1-ts1402 corresponding to a thermosensitive substitution of leucine to serine (25Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was suppressed similarly to WW→AA and ΔL1-K332* (data not shown). Mitochondria were purified from the ΔL1-K332* transformants carrying the OMS1 plasmid, and Western blot analysis revealed that overexpression of OMS1 slightly increased the steady-state level of Cox2p (Fig. 3B). To analyze the gene specificity of the suppression, we also transformed various nuclear or mitochondrial mutants showing either thermosensitive or leaky respiratory phenotypes. We found that the Δmba1 (39Preuss M. Leonhard K. Hell K. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), Δnam1 (40Groudinsky O.

https://openalex.org/W2002034916,"Although it has been established that an activity-dependent gene transcription is induced by the calcium (Ca2+) signals in neurons, it is unclear how the specific mRNA moieties are transiently accumulated in response to synaptic transmission which evokes multiple intracellular signals including Ca2+ and cAMP ones. The expression of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide, is controlled by Ca2+ signals evoked via membrane depolarization in neurons, and, in cultured rat cortical neuronal cells, we found that the Ca2+ signal-mediated activation of the PACAP gene promoter was critically controlled by a single cAMP-response element (CRE) located at around –200, to which the CRE-binding protein predominantly bound. The Ca2+ signal-induced expression of PACAP mRNA was enhanced by forskolin, which evokes cAMP signals. In support, the PACAP gene promoter was synergistically enhanced by Ca2+ and cAMP signals through the CRE, accompanying a prolonged activation of extracellular signal-related protein kinase 1/2 and CRE-binding protein. On the other hand, sole administration of forskolin markedly reduced the cellular content of PACAP mRNA, which was restored by the addition of Ca2+ signals. We found that the stability of PACAP mRNA was increased in response to Ca2+ signals but not that of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) mRNA, indicating an activity-dependent stabilization of specific mRNA species in neurons, which can antagonize the regulation mediated by cAMP signals. Thus, the transcriptional activation and mRNA stabilization are coordinately regulated by Ca2+ and cAMP signals for the cumulative expression of PACAP mRNA in neurons.

It is widely accepted that activity-dependent gene transcription in neurons is transiently induced by the Ca2+ signals evoked via glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plays a key role in establishing a long-term neuronal plasticity. Such a Ca2+ signal-mediated activation of gene transcription has fully been demonstrated with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (1Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E.

For this Ca2+ signaling in neurons, the ERK/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway is a major route that leads to the activation of CREB through phosphorylation of Ser-133 (5Rosen L.B.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) have reported that cross-talk between ERK1/2 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which are activated by Ca2+ and cAMP signals, attains a synergistic activation of CREB-dependent transcription in neurons. This coupling of both signaling pathways has also been suggested to contribute to the formation of long-lasting synaptic plasticity (8Morozov A. Muzzio I.A. Bourtchouladze R. Van-Strien N. Lapidus K.

However, it is still unclear how the cumulative expression of particular mRNA species responsible for synaptic plasticity is controlled transcriptionally and/or post-transcriptionally in response to synaptic transmission. Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a member of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/secretin/glucagon family and was first isolated from the ovine hypothalamus (9Miyata A.

PACAP, which is synthesized as a precursor of 175 amino acids, is processed to its bioactive forms, PACAP38 and PACAP27 (10Li M. Shuto Y. Somogyvari-Vigh A. Arimura A. Neuroendocrinology. 1999; 69: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which bind to at least two types of receptors, PAC1 and VPAC1/2 (11Hashimoto H. Ishihara T. Shigemoto R. Mori K.

Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). The binding of PACAP to these receptors triggers several intracellular signaling pathways, resulting in versatile biological functions (13Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar) such as neuronal survival (14Villalba M. Bockaert J. Journot L. J.

The rat PACAP gene consists of six exons including an alternative exon IA and IB and four exons encoding the coding region, and a variety of alternative transcripts are produced in neurons (17Yamamoto K. Hashimoto H. Hagihara N. Nishino A. Fujita T. Matsuda T. Baba A. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 211: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Tabuchi A. Koizumi M. Tsuda M.

Endocrinol. 2002; 192: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It has been established that the expression of the PACAP gene is activated by the Ca2+ signals in neurons (15Tabuchi A. Koizumi M. Nakatsubo J. Yaguchi T. Tsuda M. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 39: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Brandenburg C.A. May V. Braas K.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the stabilization and de-stabilization of mRNA moieties are critical to control the level of PACAP mRNA in cells (21Harakall S.A. Brandenburg C.A. Gilmartin G.A. May V. Braas K.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 865: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, therefore, we first assigned the CRE located on the PACAP gene promoter as a Ca2+ signal-response element and then investigated whether or not synergistic activation could be induced by Ca2+ and cAMP signals through the CRE and, furthermore, whether the stabilization of PACAP mRNA was affected by these signals. We found an activity-dependent stabilization of mRNA that contributed to the cumulative expression of PACAP mRNA in combination with the transcriptional activation synergistically induced by Ca2+ and cAMP signals. Reagents—Forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), nicardipine, actinomycin D, n-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide dihydrochloride (H89), 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(oaminophenylmercapto)butadiene (U0126), (9S, 10S,12R)-2,3,9,10, 11,12-hexahydro-10-hydroxy-9-methyl-1-oxo-9,12-epoxy-1H-diindolo [1,2,3-fg:3′,2′,1′-kl]pyrrolo[3,4-i](1, 6)benzodiazocine-10-carboxylic acid hexyl ester (KT5720), and dl-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies—Antibodies used for the super-shift assay were purchased from Santa Cruz and included rabbit polyclonal antibody against ATF2 (N-96) and mouse monoclonal antibody against ATF1 (C41–5.1), which specifically reacts with ATF1 but not with other ATF/CREB transcription factors. Additionally, mouse monoclonal antibody against the CREB family (25C10G) (not specific for ATF1) reacts with ATF1, CREB, and CREB modulator (CREM), and furthermore, mouse monoclonal antibody against CREB (24H4B) specifically reacts with CREB but not with other ATF/CREB transcription factors. Rabbit polyclonal antibody, which specifically cross-reacts with phosphorylated CREB at the 133rd Ser residue (#17926 Upstate Biotechnology), was also used. Normal IgG was used as a control. Cell Culture—Primary cultures of rat cortical neurons were prepared from the cerebral cortexes of 17–18-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos as described previously (22Tabuchi A. Sano K. Nakaoka R. Nakatani C. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, small pieces of cerebral cortex were dissected by enzymatic (DNase I (Sigma) followed by trypsin (Sigma)) treatment and mechanical dissociation, and the cells were seeded at 5 × 106 cells in a 60-mm culture dish (Iwaki). The cells were grown for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nissui) containing 10% fetal calf serum, and then the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing glucose (4.5 mg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), sodium selenite (5 ng/ml), bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), and kanamycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) (TIS medium). Cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (Sigma) was also added at 2 μm to prevent the proliferation of glial cells. The medium was replaced with fresh TIS medium but devoid of Ara-C 2 h before DNA transfection. RNA Isolation and Measurements of PACAP Transcripts by Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells using ISOGEN (NipponGene). RT-PCR was performed as described (15Tabuchi A. Koizumi M. Nakatsubo J. Yaguchi T. Tsuda M. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 39: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in 20 μl of 1× first strand buffer containing 0.5 μm oligo(dT)15 (5′-AGCTTTTTTTTTTV-3′) as a primer, 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 400 μm dNTPs, and 10 units of RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. After reverse transcription, the reaction mixture was treated with 1.1 units of RNase H (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 20 min and used for PCR as cDNA solution. PCR was performed in 50 μl of 1× PCR buffer containing 1 μl of cDNA solution, 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, and 0.5 μm of the primer pairs. To distinguish the four alternative exons (exon IA, exon IB, exon II) of the rat PACAP gene, PACAPE1A (5′-CTCTGTCAGCAGCAGCAGAA-3′), PACAPE1B (5′-TGTCACGCTCCCTCCTAGTT-3′), and PACAPE2as (5′-AGGTGAACAGGAGACGCTGT-3′) were used (see Fig. 1). To investigate cDNA corresponding to the coding region, PACAPE2s (5′-GGACTCAGCTTCCCTGGGAT-3′) and rPACA-PE5as (5′-AAGTACGCTATTCGGCGTCC-3′) were used. For the amplification of rat activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) cDNA, Arc sense (5′-CGCTGGAAGAAGTCCATCAA-3′) and rArc antisense (5′-GGGCTAACAGTGTAGTCGTA-3′) were used. For the internal control, rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GA-PDH) cDNA was amplified using GAPDH sense (5′-TCCATGACAACTTTGGCATCGTGG-3′) and antisense (5′-GTTGCTGTTGAAGTCACAGGAGAC-3′) primers. For amplification of preproPACAP cDNA, the PCR conditions after preheating at 95 °C for 10 min were denaturation at 96 °C for 45 s, annealing at 57 °C for 45 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplification of GAPDH was carried out for 31 cycles under the same conditions. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, and the densities of the DNA bands stained with ethidium bromide were analyzed using a Bit-Map loader (ATTO, Japan) and software (NIH image 1.52). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was carried out in an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system using SYBR Green PCR master mix. PCR was performed in 25 μl of 1× SYBR system using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosytems) containing 1 μl of cDNA solution, which was amplified as described above, and 0.5 μm primer pairs. The PCRs were carried out as follows. After preheating at 95 °C for 10 min, the samples were denatured at 95 °C for 45 s, annealed at 57 °C for 45 s, and extended at 72 °C for 1 min for 45 cycles. To generate a standard curve, known amounts of plasmid DNA with a cDNA fragment of interest were used. The threshold cycle for each sample was taken from the linear range and converted to the starting amount by interpolation from a standard curve. For an internal control, GAPDH cDNA was amplified, and the levels of PACAP transcripts were normalized to GAPDH. Reporter Vectors Used for Promoter Analysis and Overexpression Experiments—The rat PACAP promoter gene (–787∼+376) was amplified by PCR. The genomic gene was isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat cortical neurons. The PCR with rat genomic DNA was performed in 50 μl of 1× PCR buffer containing 1.5 units of Pfu polymerase (Promega), 2 mm MgSO4, 1 μm dNTPs, and 1 μm of primer pair (sense, 5′-GAGGCTGTGGTGAAAATTAAACCAGTGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGGGGACTTGTTTGCCGAAGCTAAAATTCC-3′). The PCR product was ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II (KS+) and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned rat PACAP gene promoter was identical to the one that other groups reported (23Park J.I. Kim W.J. Wang L. Park H.J. Lee J. Park J.H. Kwon H.B. Tsafriri A. Chun S.Y. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2000; 6: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24White S.L. May V. Braas K.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 921: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For the promoter analysis, the luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-rat PACAP promoter (pPACAPp-1AB), was constructed by ligation of pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) with a KpnI/SacI-digested fragment including the region (–787∼+376) of the rat PACAP gene promoter from the pBluescript II (KS+)-rat PACAP promoter. As an internal control vector for the luciferase experimental vector, we used a Renilla luciferase vector carrying the human elongation factor 1α promoter (pRL-EF1α) (2Tabuchi A. Nakaoka R. Amano K. Yukimine M. Andoh T. Kuraishi Y. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17269-17275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For the overexpression experiments, we used a β-galactosidase vector carrying the human elongation factor 1α promoter (EF1α-β-Gal) as an internal control (25Tabuchi A. Sakaya H. Kisukeda T. Fushiki H. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35920-35931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The site-directed mutagenesis for the substitution of 4–8 bases within pPACAPp-1AB was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Left-side CRE-Lmut, all CRE-Cmut, and right-side CRE-Rmut were generated using as a forward primer, 5′-CCTTGAGGGACTAGGGCAGTGACGTCTTTTACTGATACCGGATC-3′, 5′-CCTTGAGGGACTAGGATGCCACGACTGTTTACTGATACCGGATC-3′, and 5′-CCTTGAGGGACTAGGATGCTGACGTCTAGATCTGATACCGGATC-3′, respectively, and the complementary primer pair (the underline means substituted nucleotide bases). The expression vector A-CREB, was generously provided by Dr. C. Vinson (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health). DNA Transfection, Luciferase, and β-Galactosidase Assays—DNA transfection was carried out over 3 days in culture using calcium phosphate/DNA precipitation as already described (22Tabuchi A. Sano K. Nakaoka R. Nakatani C. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitates were prepared by mixing one volume (100 μl) of plasmid DNA (8 μg, pPACAPp:pRL-EF1α = 50: 1) in a 250 mm CaCl2 solution with an equal volume of 2× HBS (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.05), 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4) and added to a 60-mm dish. For overexpression experiments, we used plasmid DNA (8 μg, pPAC-APp:EF1α-β-Gal:expression vector = 5:1:10). The dish was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh TIS medium was added. After 40 h, the transfected cells were stimulated with 25 or 50 mm KCl (25 or 50 mm KCl stimulation) or vehicle for 6∼9 h, and cell lysates were prepared. For the dual (firefly and Renilla) luciferase assay, cell lysates were extracted with passive lysis buffer (Promega) and used as described previously (2Tabuchi A. Nakaoka R. Amano K. Yukimine M. Andoh T. Kuraishi Y. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17269-17275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Tabuchi A. Sakaya H. Kisukeda T. Fushiki H. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35920-35931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For the measurement of β-galactosidase activity as an internal control, cell lysates were extracted with 250 μl of cell lysis buffer containing 1 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Triton X-100; 20 μl of the lysate was used for the chemiluminescence-based β-galactosidase assay (Clontech) and 20 μl was used for the firefly luciferase assay (26Sasaki M. Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Huang H. Herring W.J. Ahn S. Ginty D.D. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8617-8622Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Forty hours after the medium exchange at 3 days in vitro, cells were stimulated with 25 mm KCl or vehicle and incubated for 6 h. Then nuclear extracts were prepared as described with minor modifications (27Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out using probes corresponding to the PACAP sequence, as reported previously (25Tabuchi A. Sakaya H. Kisukeda T. Fushiki H. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35920-35931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, end-labeling of DNA probes was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in 10 μl of reaction mixture (6.6 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 6.6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dATP, 0.5 mm dGTP, 0.5 mm dTTP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 200 ng of DNA, 2 μl of [32P]dCTP, and 1 unit of Klenow fragments. Then DNA probes were recovered with a Sephadex G-50 column. The DNA-protein binding reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 15 min in 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 2 μg of poly [dI-dC], 0.2–0.4 ng of 32P-labeled DNA probes, and 5 μg of nuclear extract). Then, DNA-protein complexes were separated on 4% polyacrylamide gel at 132 V for 2.5 h. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry. For supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a series of antibodies (2 mg/ml) was used at a dilution of 1:20. Western Blotting—After preparing the cell lysates and denaturing in 1× sample buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) for 5 min at 95 °C, 10 μg of proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel at 20 mA. Sample proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Bio-Rad), and the filter was blocked with 5% skim milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween. The filter was incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-CREB (1:1000, New England Biolabs (NEB)), rabbit anti-CREB (1:1000, NEB), rabbit anti-active-MAP kinase (1:2500, NEB), or rabbit anti-MAP kinase (1:5000, NEB) overnight at 4 °C and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-IgG (1:15,000, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. CREB and ERK1/2 were finally detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting detection reagents, Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—All values represent the means ± S.E. of a number of separate experiments performed in duplicate, as indicated in the corresponding figures. Comparisons between groups were made using Student's t test followed by the F-test, with p < 0.05 as the minimum level of significance. Increases in Expression of PACAP Multiple Transcripts Induced by Membrane Depolarization—We first examined which transcripts encoding PACAP were expressed and increased in amount with membrane depolarization induced by high K+ (25 mm KCl) in rat cortical neurons. The combinations of primers were designed to examine the transcripts containing exon IA-II or IB-II and the exon II-V transcripts containing the coding sequences (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, the expression of all the transcripts began to increase 3 h after the exposure of cells to 25 mm KCl, and this increase was maintained for at least 24 h. Three amplified DNA bands of different lengths were observed with the transcripts of exon IA-II, whereas only a single amplified band was observed with those of exon IB-II and exon II-V (Fig. 1B). The expression patterns of these transcripts were the same as those expressed in mouse cerebellar granule cells (18Tabuchi A. Koizumi M. Tsuda M. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1181-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and in an immunostaining analysis, the PACAP-positive signals were found to increase with most of the neurons in culture (data not shown but see the Tabuchi et al. (15Tabuchi A. Koizumi M. Nakatsubo J. Yaguchi T. Tsuda M. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 39: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). Dependence of the Promoter Activation upon Ca2+Influx into Neurons—To detect the promoter activity of the PACAP gene, we constructed a plasmid containing both exon IA and exon IB in front of a luciferase reporter gene (pPACAPp-1AB) (Fig. 2A). The DNA transfection experiments of pPACAPp-IAB revealed that the luciferase activity increased upon KCl elevation and the increase in luciferase activity was higher at 50 mm KCl than at 25 mm KCl (Fig. 2A). However, the plasmids containing the region covering either exon IA or IB revealed only low basal and stimulatory promoter activity (data not shown), suggesting the presence of some cis-elements controlling the basal promoter activity of the PACAP gene. From these results, it is evident that cis-elements largely responsible for the inducibility of the PACAP promoter are located in the 5′-flanking region of exon IA. Using the plasmid pPACAPp-1AB, we examined the effect of blockade of a Ca2+ influx into neurons, which was attained with nicardipine and APV, potent antagonists for L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel and N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor, respectively, on the activation of PACAP promoter IA. As shown in Fig. 2A, the residual activation of promoter IA was detected when either nicardipine or APV was added to the medium containing 50 mm KCl, but a simultaneous addition of these antagonists completely abolished the activation. Thus, both the Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel and N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor were effective for inducing the activation of the PACAP promoter. Pinpoint Usage of a Single CRE for the Activation of the Promoter—To assign the region responsible for the Ca2+ responsiveness of the promoter, we first examined the effect of a series of internal deletions of the promoter and finally found that the 30-bp deletion between –213 and –184 markedly reduced the activation of the promoter activity (data not shown), in which a CRE-like element (CRE-LE) is present. To further examine whether the activation of the promoter is attributable to the CRE-LE or not, we exchanged all the nucleotides covering the CRE-LE. In addition, we exchanged four nucleotides surrounding the CRE-LE to examine the possible contribution of these sequences to the promoter activation. As shown in Fig. 2B, the exchange of all nucleotides of CRE-LE markedly reduced the basal promoter activity and almost completely abolished the activation, whereas the mutations introduced into the 5′- and 3′-surrounding regions of CRE-LE did not reduce the activation. Predominant Binding of CREB to CRE-LE—To specify the proteins binding to CRE-LE, we performed a supershift gelmobility assay using probe C, which contains CRE-LE and its surrounding nucleotide sequences (nucleotide position –211 ∼ –187) (Fig. 3A). When the anti-CREB/ATF family antibody was added to the DNA binding reaction mixture, the bands, which were formed specifically (data not shown), were markedly supershifted (Fig. 3A, compare lane 2 with lane 1). The addition of anti-ATF1 or anti-ATF2 antibody did not shift the bands (lanes 3 and 4), whereas that of anti-CREB or antiphosphorylated CREB antibody markedly shifted the bands (lanes 5 and 6). To further address the crucial role of CREB in the Ca2+ signal-mediated activation of promoter IA, mutant plasmid vectors of dominant negative CREB were introduced into rat cortical neurons with a reporter plasmid, pPACAPp-1AB. Although overexpression of wild type CREB did not alter the activation level, that of A-CREB, a mutant with an acidic extension at the N terminus of the CREB leucine zipper domain that could interfere with the binding to DNA and transcriptional activation of wild type CREB (28Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), or K-CREB, a mutant with a substitution in the DNA binding domain that could inhibit the binding of wild type CREB (29Jean D. Harbison M. McConkey D.J. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24884-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), significantly decreased the promoter activation induced by depolarization (Fig. 3B). Changes in Cellular Content of PACAP mRNA Induced by Ca2+and cAMP Signals—Using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we measured the expression levels of PACAP exon II-V transcripts when the cells were treated with depolarization and/or forskolin for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 4A, the level of the transcripts began to increase 3 h and peaked 6 h after the onset of depolarization. In contrast to this, the level of the transcripts rapidly decreased upon the addition of forskolin at 5 mm KCl even at 1 h after the treatment and remained reduced for at least 12 h. Simultaneous addition of depolarization with forskolin, however, markedly increased the expression levels of transcripts more than the sole addition of depolarization at 6 and 12 h after the stimulation (Fig. 4A). The expression levels of transcripts were not changed at 5 mm KCl. Because the addition of nicardipine and APV markedly decreased the expression level of transcripts attained upon depolarization (Fig. 4B), the elevation of exon II-V transcripts induced by depolarization is caused by the Ca2+ influx into neurons through L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel and N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor. Co-administration of forskolin with depolarization further enhanced the expression level compared with that attained by depolarization only, the level of which was also reduced in the presence of nicardipine and APV, and furthermore, more extensively reduc"

The structure reveals a typical thioredoxin fold with characteristic structural features that account for the substrate specificity of the protein. The surface of TRP14 in the vicinity of the active site includes an extended loop and an additional α-helix, and the distribution of charged residues in the surface is different from Trx1. The distinctive dipeptide between the redox-active cysteines contributes to stabilizing the thiolate anion of the active site cysteine 43, increasing reactivity of the cysteine toward substrates. These structural differences in the active site suggest that TRP14 has evolved to regulate cellular redox signaling by recognizing a distinctive group of substrates that would complement the group of proteins regulated by Trx1.

Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In diverse organisms, it plays various physiological roles, acting as an electron donor and as a regulator of transcription and apoptosis as well as antioxidants (1Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Trx functions as a carrier that transfers electrons to enzymes involved in DNA synthesis and protein disulfide reduction: ribonucleotide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase (2Stubbe J.

Trx is also involved in the defense against oxidative stress through peroxiredoxins (Prxs) that directly remove cellular reactive oxygen species. Other functions of Trx include the regulation of apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) to inhibit its activity (7Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Sequences of Trxs in various species are 27–69% identical to that of Escherichia coli, and all Trxs have the same three-dimensional fold, which consists of central five β-strands surrounded by four α-helices (9Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 10Weichsel A. Gasdaska J.R. Powis G. Montfort W.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 735-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The N-terminal cysteine of the Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys motif in Trx is redox-sensitive, and the motif is highly conserved. When compared with the general cysteine, the N-terminal cysteine has a lowered pKa value (11Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Various proteins sharing the Trx-like active site sequence have been found and classified as part of the Trx superfamily (12Matsuo Y. Hirota K. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Drug News Perspect. 2002; 15: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Among them, thioredoxin-related protein (TRP32) with the N-terminal thioredoxin domain has been found to bind to the catalytic fragment of mammalian STE-20-like kinase (13Lee K.K. Murakawa M.

The active site sequence Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys of TRP32 is identical to that of thioredoxin. In contrast, nucleoredoxin (14Laughner B.J. Sehnke P.C. Ferl R.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein (15Matsuo Y. Akiyama N. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Noda M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. J.

Recently, a novel thioredoxin-related protein (TRP14) was found from rat brain (16Jeong W. Yoon H.W. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3142-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Jeong W. Chang T.S. Boja E.S. Fales H.M. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3151-3159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is a 14-kDa cytosolic protein that contains a Cys-Pro-Asp-Cys motif with a sequence identity to human Trx (Trx1) of about 20%. TRP14 shows activity as disulfide reductase and takes up electrons from cytosolic thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1), like Trx1. However, TRP14 does not donate electrons to ribonucleotide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase, and Prxs, which are well known substrates of Trx1. TRP14 regulates TNF-α-induced signaling pathways in a different manner from Trx1. In RNA interference experiments, the depletion of TRP14 increased TNF-α-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα more than the depletion of Trx1 did. TRP14 also facilitated activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase induced by TNF-α. Unlike Trx1, TRP14 shows neither interaction nor interference with ASK1. Here, we determined the crystal structure of human TRP14 to understand the structural mechanisms for the substrate specificity of the protein and the biological role. The structure of TRP14 reveals a special surface topology with unique electrostatic surface properties near the active site that is quite different from Trx1. The distinctive surface properties of TRP14 explain the mechanism by which the target specificity is different between TRP14 and Trx1. In addition, the structural study of TRP14 provides us with information on the diversity and specificity of cellular redox regulation in the cytosol that are achieved by two distinctive Trx isotypes, TRP14 and Trx1. Protein Purification—The wild-type TRP14 protein was prepared as described (16Jeong W. Yoon H.W. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3142-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, the harvested cells were dissolved in buffer A (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA) and lysed by sonication. The pellet obtained by streptomycin sulfate and ammonium sulfate fractionation was dissolved in buffer A containing 0.5 m ammonium sulfate. Then, the protein fractions obtained by phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF were dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA) and applied to the Mono-Q column. The purified protein was dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.00) and concentrated to 20 mg/ml for crystallization. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization of TRP14 was carried out by using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. The reservoir solution consisted of 10%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 10%(w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethylether 2000, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5). 1.8 μl of protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution. Plate-shaped crystals grew at the full size of 1.0 × 0.5 × 0.2 mm in 1–2 days. The TRP14 crystals belonged to the P212121 space group with unit cell dimensions of a = 26.86 Å, b = 48.39 Å, c = 81.84 Å. The crystals contained one monomer in the asymmetric unit with the Matthews coefficient and the solvent content of 1.83 Å/Da and 34%, respectively. The multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data for the structure determination were collected in the beamline 18B at the Photon Factory by using an ADSC CCD detector. Before the data collection, a single crystal was soaked in stabilizing solution supplemented with 0.5 m sodium bromide for about 30 s and flash-frozen. Data for five different wavelengths including two peak wavelengths (λ1 and λ2), two edge wavelengths (λ1 and λ2), and a remote wavelength (λ5) were collected (Table I). Measurements for multiple peak and edge wavelengths were performed to take account of differences in the absorption edge of bromine between solution and crystalline states. All data were integrated using the program MOSFLM (18Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The phases were further improved by solvent flattening by using the program DM (19Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The resulting electron density map was of sufficient quality for the initial model building. The program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13005) Google Scholar) was used for the model building. When most residues in the molecule were built into the model, the model coordinates were transferred to the high resolution data and refined by using the program CNS (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Water molecules were gradually added by the water_pick routine implemented in CNS. In the refined model, 94.2% of all residues in the molecule are in the most favored regions, and only one residue (Glu107) remains in a disallowed region of Ramachandran plot drawn by the program PROCHECK (24.Laskowski, R. A. MacArthur, M. W., Moss, D. S., and Thornton, J. M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 26, 283-291Google Scholar). The residue Glu107 has strong interaction with the residue Asn81 in the symmetry-related molecule, and the quality of electron density map around Glu107 is excellent. The final model includes residues 4–122 of TRP14 and 43 water molecules. Activity Assay of Redissolved Crystals—TRP14 crystals were redissolved in 1 mm EDTA and 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0) after rinsing the crystals several times with the reservoir solution. The activity assay of TRP14 was started by the addition of oxytocin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 100 μm to a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 100 nm TrxR1, and 6 μm TRP14. The reaction was performed at 30 °C, and oxytocin reduction was monitored on the basis of A340. Overall Structure—The structure of TRP14 was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method with a sodium bromide (0.5 m) soaked crystal. TRP14 folds into a compact and globular domain with the approximate dimensions of 25 × 30 × 35 Å (Fig. 1). Despite low sequence identity (20%) between TRP14 and Trx, the topological structure of TRP14 is similar to that of Trx. When we superimposed TRP14 and Trx1 (Protein Data Bank code 1ERU) (10Weichsel A. Gasdaska J.R. Powis G. Montfort W.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 735-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), 81 out of 119 Cα atoms could be aligned with a root mean square deviation of 2.0 Å (Fig. 2). The redox-active Cys-Xaa1-Xaa2-Cys motif (Xaa is any amino acid) of TRP14 (Cys43-Pro44-Asp45-Cys46) is located at the N terminus helix α2. A disulfide bond between the two cysteines was evident in the electron density map, indicating that the structure is in an oxidized state.Fig. 2Structure-based sequence alignment of TRP14 homologs. Secondary structural elements of human TRP14 and human Trx1 (hTrx1) are indicated above and below the sequences, respectively. Residues with 100% identity are colored orange, and residues with a conservation value above 6.0 in all TRP14 family members are colored yellow, as defined in the program ALSCRIPT (34Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) There are several important structural differences between TRP14 and Trx1. First, the region of TRP14 corresponding to helix α3 of Trx1 is divided into two separated helices (α3a and α3b) with the insertion of 4 residues (Figs. 1b and 2). In addition, helix α3a is shifted toward the face of the redox-active site significantly. A structure-based sequence alignment (Fig. 2) shows that residues 73–87 including helix α3a and a part of helix α3b in TRP14 cannot be aligned with Trx1. Helix α3a in TRP14 interfering with the surface near the redox-active site may play a role in determining target specificity by limiting its interaction with Trx target proteins (see below). Other structural differences are found in loop β2-α2 (residues 33–42) that have an insertion of 7 residues in comparison with Trx1 (Fig. 2). The extended loop of TRP14 is located in front of the redox-active Cys-Xaa1-Xaa2-Cys motif and is likely to play a role in target recognition or specificity as the helices α3a and α3b. The extended loop appears to be stabilized by several hydrogen bonds, including interactions between the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Ser32 and the amide nitrogen atom of Lys33 and the interactions between the carbonyl oxygen atom of Lys40 and the Cα carbon of Ala35. In addition, the carbonyl oxygen of Ala36 forms hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogens of Gly39 and Lys40. Active Site—The active site Cys43-Pro44-Asp45-Cys46 motif in TRP14 is located at the starting position of helix α2. The N-terminal Cys43 is exposed to solvent, indicating that the thiol group of the residue could be easily accessible for the reaction with substrates. The reactivity and redox potential of Trx-related proteins are highly dependent on the dipeptide sequence within the Cys-Xaa1-Xaa2-Cys motif. The dipeptide sequence (Pro-Asp) of TRP14 is unique in comparison with that of Trx1 (Gly-Pro). The difference of the dipeptide sequences between TRP14 and Trx1 seems to affect the pKa of the first cysteine that is an important indicator of the reactivity of the redox-active cysteines. The cysteine pKa of the Trx-related proteins ranges between 3.0 and 7.0, being significantly lower than that of the natural cysteine thiolate (∼8.5). The lowered cysteine pKa is essential for the redox reaction because the ionization of the cysteine sulfide increases reactivity toward substrates by increasing the nucleophilicity of the cysteine. In TRP14, the Cys43 thiolate anion is stabilized by the partial positive charge of the helix dipole of helix α2 as in Trx1. However, the strength of stabilization seems to be different between TRP14 and Trx1. In particular, the unique dipeptide (Pro-Asp) sequence between the two cysteines seems to contribute to the low pKa of the Cys43 thiolate by strengthening the helix dipole that is mainly governed by main chain hydrogen-bonding network of the first two turns of the helix. In Trx1, the dipeptide sequence is Gly-Pro, in which the position of proline is different from that of TRP14. The proline residue of Trx1 in the Xaa2 position results in the disruption of a hydrogen bond between the amide nitrogen and the N-terminal cysteine sulfur. In comparison, the Asp in the Xaa2 position of TRP14 does not disrupt the hydrogen bond (Fig. 3). The proline of TRP14 in the Xaa1 position does not affect the hydrogen-bonding network because the main chain amide nitrogen of Xaa1 is not in the geometry to make a strong hydrogen bond with the N-terminal cysteine sulfur. The strengthening of the helix dipole in TPR14 is consistent with the biochemical measurement of the pKa value of the N-terminal Cys43 to be 6.1 (16Jeong W. Yoon H.W. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3142-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which is lower than that of the corresponding cysteine of Trx (∼7.0). The structure of an E. coli disulfide bond exchange protein DsbA exhibits a similar phenomenon (25Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C. Martin J.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). DsbA is known for having an extremely low pKa value of 3.4. The dipeptide sequence within the Cys-Xaa1-Xaa2-Cys motif of DsbA (Cys-Pro-His-Cys) is similar to those in TRP14, in which the position of Pro is the same with TPR14 and a non-proline residue occupies the Xaa2 position. In the crystal structure of reduced DsbA, the thiolate in Cys30 (corresponding to Cys43 in TRP14) forms hydrogen bonds with amide groups of Xaa1 and Xaa2 residues. Although the side chain of His32 plays a major role in lowering the pKa value by forming a charge interaction with the thiolate, mutations of His32 to non-charged residues such as Tyr and Ser still represent low pKa values ranging from 3.8 to 4.9, indicating that the non-proline residue in the Xaa2 position plays a critical role in lowering the pKa of the first cysteine in the CXXC motif (26Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C. Glockshuber R. Huber-Wunderlich M. Zander T. Martin J.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Surface Characteristics—The surface surrounding the active site of TRP14 includes the protruding helix α3a and loop β2-α2 (Fig. 4a), which is highly distinguishable from the wide and flat surface of Trx1 and Grx (Fig. 4, b and c). The wide and flat surface of Trx1 and Grx would be advantageous for interacting with a variety of substrates that need to be reduced by Trx1 and Grx. In comparison, the specialized molecular surface of TRP14 is likely to restrict the interaction of many proteins that do not have a molecular surface complementary to the specialized TRP14 surface. In the complex structures between Trx1 and peptide substrates that originated from Ref-1 (27Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.P. Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 613-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and NF-κB (28Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.P. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the target peptides bind to the crescent-shaped groove on the surface of the Trx1. In the peptide binding interactions, the side chain of Tyr60 in the NFκB peptide corresponding to the P-2 binding site (P0 denotes the active cysteine of the peptide, and the negative number indicates a residue N-terminal to the cysteine residue) has many hydrophobic interactions with various residues (Phe27, Val59, Ala66, Val71, Ala73, and Thr74) in Trx1. Although the Ref-1 peptide is complexed with Trx in a reversed chain direction (27Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.P. Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 613-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the P-2 site is replaced by bulky tryptophan in the Ref-1 peptide, and its hydrophobic interactions are still similar to those of the NFκB complexed structure. However, in TRP14, the protruding helix α3a completely covers the P-2 binding site and thus blocks the access of Trx substrates. In addition to the molecular surface differences, the charge distribution on the TRP14 active site surface is completely different from that of Trx1. Although the Trx1 surface is mainly made of hydrophobic patches, that of TRP14 has highly charged characters with both positively charged regions (Lys40, Lys74, Lys78, and Arg85) and negatively charged regions (Asp36, Asp45, Glu48, and Glu107). Among the charged residues, the Xaa2 residue (Asp45) of the Cys-Xaa1-Xaa2-Cys motif plays an important role to form a negatively charged surface patch. Several hydrophobic residues (Trp42, Val71, Trp77, Pro94, Val93, and Leu111) are spread out in between the charged regions. The highly charged surface of TRP14 should act as a determinant for the specific recognition of potential substrates. The surface of Grx also has a small patch of positively charged residues (Fig. 4c), but the extent of the charged region is significantly less than that of TRP14, and the distribution of the charged residues is completely different between the two proteins. Thus, TRP14 seems to have evolved to recognize a completely different set of substrates that are not reduced by Trx1 or Grx. The significant structural and surface differences between TRP14 and other cellular reductants led us to test whether the crystallized TRP14 retains its biological activity. We redissolved the TRP14 crystals and measured the reductase activity of the protein by using oxytocin as the substrate (Fig. 5). Oxytocin, which comprises 9 amino acids with an intramolecular disulfide, was shown to be a substrate of the soluble TRP14 (16Jeong W. Yoon H.W. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3142-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5, the TRP14 protein redissolved from crystals exhibits almost the same activity as the soluble TRP14, indicating that the TRP14 conformation observed in the crystal represents the biologically active state. Substrate Specificity—Trx-related proteins function as electron shuttles by transferring electrons (or reducing power) from donors to acceptors. In the process, the proteins must interact with both electron donors and acceptors in a sequential manner. TRP14 accepts electrons from Trx reductase 1 (TR1) but not from Trx reductase 2 (TR2), whereas Trx1 does from both TR1 and TR2 (16Jeong W. Yoon H.W. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3142-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The differences in specificity for the electron donation of TRP14 and Trx1 are more pronounced. That is, there seem to be no common substrates between TRP14 and Trx1. For example, Trx transfers electrons to ribonucleotide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase, and Prxs, whereas TRP14 reduces none of the proteins. Instead, TRP14 was shown to interact with LC18 (17Jeong W. Chang T.S. Boja E.S. Fales H.M. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3151-3159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These distinctive substrate specificities should be accounted for by the surface differences described in the previous section. Of interest is the ability of TRP14 to accept electrons from TR1, as does Trx1, although the surfaces near the redox-active site of the two proteins are completely different. The reactivity toward TR1 may be due to the C-terminal extension of TR1 with selenocysteine, which would transfer electrons from the TR1 active site to substrates (29Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The flexibility of the C-terminal extension would enable TR1 to accommodate both TRP14 and Trx1 as substrates (29Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Although TR2 also has the selenocysteine-containing C-terminal extension, the cytosolic protein TRP14 seems not to have evolved to interact with TR2, which is a mitochondrial protein. There were previous examples in which the substrate specificity of redox proteins was attributed to differences in the interacting surface characteristics. The Grx-homologous protein NrdH exhibits Trx1-like activity because the active site surface of NrdH has hydrophobic characteristics like Trx1 (30Stehr M. Schneider G. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35836-35841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Haemophilus influenzae hybrid-Prx5 showed that the specificity of electron donors was determined by the binding surfaces of Prx isotypes (31Kim S.J. Woo J.R. Hwang Y.S. Jeong D.G. Shin D.H. Kim K. Ryu S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10790-10798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although sequences of human Prx5 and H. influenzae hybrid-Prx5 are highly homologous, the active site surfaces are different, and the two proteins have different substrate specificities in which human Prx5 and H. influenzae hybrid-Prx5 use Trx and Grx as electron donors, respectively. These results support that the active surface of redox proteins affects the substrate specificity of the proteins and the specialized surface of TRP14 provide the protein with a highly specific selectivity in binding with its potential substrates. Implication for Cellular Redox Regulation—Redox homeostasis is important in cellular functions including signal transduction, transcription, immune responses, and apoptosis (32Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 430-484Google Scholar). The functional regulations by cellular redox status are mediated by oxidation of exposed cysteine residues by reactive oxygen species, and the reduction of the oxidized cysteines is done by Trx-related proteins. Although the conventionally known reducing agent Trx1 has broad substrate specificity, it would be an impossible task for a protein to recognize all of the redox-regulated proteins in cells. Thus, mammalian cells should have auxiliary factors that could complement the function of Trx1. Until today, there were only three known Trx-related proteins (Trx1, TRP32, and TRP14) in cytosol, where most cellular signaling occurs. TRP14 is a good candidate to play an active role as a redox regulator because the protein accepts electrons from TR, whereas TRP32 does not (33Hirota K. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Yodoi J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 957: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The structure of the cytosolic protein TRP14 reveals a charged and uneven active site that is very different from that of Trx1. However, the completely different active site surface may be complementary in the function of two proteins as redox regulators by extending the range of substrates recognized by the redox regulators. In addition to the surface differences, TRP14 and Trx1 also exhibit differences in hydrogen-bonding interactions of the redox-active cysteines due to a different dipeptide sequence between the two cysteines, which explains the different redox properties of TPR14, such as cysteine reactivity (pKa) and redox potential. Thus, the TRP14 structure shows that the protein is designed to act as both an auxiliary factor for Trx1 and a specific redox regulator for cellular redox signaling pathways. We thank N.

The results showed that annexin 6 is bound in the apical placenta membranes in a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding manner but also in a calcium-independent fashion. The neutralization of annexin 6 decreased the total current by 39 ± 1.9% in the range of ±80 mV, and the currents decrease with the time. The single-channel slope conductance was decreased from 253 ± 7.4 pS (control) to 105 ± 13 pS, and the amplitude decreased by 50%. The open probability was also affected when higher voltage steps were used, changes in either the positive or negative direction induced the channel to close, and the open probability (Po) did not decrease. In channels with neutralized annexin 6, it was maintained at 1 at ±40 mV and at ±80 mV. These results suggest that endogenous annexin 6 could regulate the Maxi-chloride channel.

The human placental syncytiotrophoblast is a polarized epithelial structure that results from the fusion of precursor cytotrophoblast cells producing a syncytium. It is the main barrier for materno-fetal exchange. Ionic transport in the syncytiotrophoblast involves conductive pathways that are associated with numerous epithelial functions, such as maintenance of membrane voltage, cell volume regulation, solute transport, and others. In placenta the 4,4′diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulphonic acid (DIDS)-sensitive Cl- conductances and K+ conductances contribute to the resting potential of the syncytiotrophoblast microvillous membrane and are involved in volume regulation (1Birdsey T.J. Boyd R.D. Sibley C.P. Greenwood S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R1479-R1488PubMed Google Scholar, 2Clarson L.H. Greenwood S.L. Mylona P. Sibley C.P. Placenta. 2001; 22: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Chloride is the main anion of extracellular fluid in the fetus, as it is in the adult, but at all gestational ages fetal Cl- is 5–6 mm higher than in maternal blood. There are no maternal-fetal differences in either Na+ or K+ concentration (3Bissonnette J.M. Weiner C.P. Power Jr., G.G. Placenta. 1994; 15: 445-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). There has been considerable interest focused on the chloride conductance of the human placenta apical membrane and how it is regulated. However, the specific ion channels involved in these and other placental processes are as yet unknown. A possible molecular candidate for the 4,4′diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulphonic acid-sensitive anion conductance in apical syncytiotrophoblast plasma membrane is a Maxi-chloride channel. Maxi-chloride channels have been identified in secreting and absorbing epithelia (4Halm D.R. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen.

This channel may play a role in complex cellular regulation involving inhibition through phosphorylation by protein kinase C, activation by a Ca2+-dependent process, and in volume regulation. More recently, Sabirov et al. (12Sabirov R.Z. Dutta A.K. Okada Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) concluded that this channel serves as a pathway for swelling-induced ATP release. In normal human term placentae, the Maxi-chloride channel from the apical membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast has similar biophysical characteristics to the other Maxi-chloride channels in epithelial and non-epithelial cells. There is evidence that suggests that the cytoskeleton participates in the regulation of the Maxi-chloride channels involved in volume regulation decrease. In the non-swelling rabbit cortical collecting cell line RCCT-28A, agents that depolymerize F-actin enhance the chloride current by activation of the Maxi-chloride channel. On the other hand, F-actin-stabilizing agents prevent the activation of this channel. This evidence suggests that desegregation of the cytoskeleton activates Maxi-chloride channels and could be the reason why the activity of the Maxi-chloride channel is detected mainly in isolated patches. In 1999 Babiychuk and collaborators (13Babiychuk E.B. Palstra R.J. Schaller J. Kampfer U. Draeger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35191-35195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) found that annexin 6 participated in the formation of reversible membrane cytoskeleton complexes in smooth muscle cells. Annexins are membrane organizers that interact with actin and could be determining factors in complex formation between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. Annexins are a family of calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. Calcium reversibly shifts the annexins from a soluble to a membrane-associated state (14Crumpton M.J. Dedman J.R. Nature. 1990; 345: 212Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15Seaton B.A. Dedman J.R. Biometals. 1998; 11: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Several reports show that specific members of the annexin family participate in the regulation of ionic channels in different cells (16Chan H.C. Kaetzel M.A. Gotter A.L. Dedman J.R. Nelson D.J. J.

Behbehani M.M. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2004-C2015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that annexin 6 regulates the potassium and calcium currents of sensorial neurons. By using nonspecific affinity-purified anti-annexin 6 antibody they found an increase in the magnitude of the K+ current and an increase in the Ca2+ current in sensory neurons. These reports suggest that endogenous annexin 6 regulates the Ca2+ conductance, which indirectly modifies Ca2+-dependent ionic conductances in neurons. Diaz-Muñoz et al. (17Diaz-Munoz M. Hamilton S.L. Kaetzel M.A. Hazarika P. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15894-15899PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that annexin 6 increased the mean open time and opening frequency of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine-sensitive calcium channels. In placenta, annexin 6 is expressed in cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, fetal vascular endothelium, and chorionic trophoblasts throughout pregnancy (21Rambotti M.G. Spreca A. Donato R. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 579-588PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of annexin 6 in the regulation of the Maxi-chloride channel of apical membranes isolated from placentae from normal subjects and reconstituted in giant liposomes. The results showed that the electrophysiological characteristics of chloride channels with neutralized annexin 6 are different from those with intact annexin 6. These results suggest that annexin 6 has the ability to regulate the Cl- conductance in human placenta. Placenta Collection—Placentae obtained from normal pregnancies were collected immediately after delivery from the San José Hospital Maternity Unit and transported to the laboratory on ice. Immunohistochemistry of Human Placentae—Archival formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded placental blocks were used. Paraffin-embedded placentae tissue sections were cut at 7 μm. To detect annexin 6, we used the Vectastain ABC Peroxidase Elite IgG goat kit for the polyclonal antibody against annexin 6 (dilution 1:750, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with aminoethyl carbazole, which produces a red stain, as the peroxidase substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). All sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for 1 min and then mounted in 1:9 phosphate-buffered saline/glycerol. Preimmune goat serum was used as a negative control. All sections were examined by one observer who was blinded to tissue identity, and localization and intensity of the immunostaining were recorded. Preparation of Placental Apical Membrane Vesicles—The human placental microvillous membrane (MVM) 1The abbreviations used are: MVM, microvillous membrane; ECL, enhance chemiluminescence; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; pS, picosiemens. vesicles were prepared by a method we have described (22Jimenez V. Henriquez M. Llanos P. Riquelme G. Placenta. 2004; 25: 422-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that allows simultaneous isolation of apical and basal membranes from the same placenta. This method is a modification of the method described by Illsley et al. (23Illsley N.P. Wang Z.Q. Gray A. Sellers M.C. Jacobs M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1029: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We added one step to isolate plasma membrane free of mitochondrial membranes (24Gasnier F. Rousson R. Lerme F. Vaganay E. Louisot P. Gateau-Roesch O. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and have preserved the conditions used in our apical membrane isolation protocol when working with this simultaneous isolation protocol. The purification method involved precipitation of a non-microvillous membrane with magnesium ions, differential centrifugation, and a sucrose step gradient. All solutions were buffered with 20 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4. A portion (2–3 ml) of the microvillous-enriched preparation containing about 10–15 mg of protein was overlaid on the sucrose gradient. The band at the 37/45% sucrose interface was collected and diluted 10-fold with 20 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4, before centrifugation at 110,000 × g for 30 min. The final pellet was resuspended in 300 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-maleate, pH 7.4, and stored at -150 °C (liquid nitrogen). The purity and enrichment of the MVM membrane fraction was evaluated routinely using enzymatic assays, binding studies, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry for mitochondrial membrane markers. Enrichment of alkaline phosphatase activity (an apical membrane marker) for MVM was 17- to 21-fold, with 13–16% protein recovery relative to the homogenate, and was essentially free of basal membranes and mitochondrial membranes. Lack of contamination of purified apical membranes from basal and mitochondrial membranes was confirmed by quantification of adenylate cyclase activity and binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to β-adrenergic receptors both basal membrane markers, and cytochrome-c oxidase/succinate dehydrogenase as mitocondria markers. Western Blot Analysis—Samples from the placenta preparation fractions were diluted in sample buffer, containing 0.25 m Tris (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Protein samples were loaded (30 μg per lane) and separated using 12% Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen) run at 100 mV. Low molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were loaded as standards. The gels were then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics, Inc). The blots were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v), and 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk at room temperature with agitation. The blots were then incubated with 1:2000 dilution of anti-annexin 6 antibody (200 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat at 1:2000 dilution, and washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20. Western blot was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using an ECL kit (Pierce). Reconstitution of the Apical Membrane into Giant Liposomes—Giant liposomes were prepared by submitting a mixture of the isolated apical membrane vesicles and asolectin lipid vesicles to a partial dehydration/rehydration cycle, as reported by Riquelme et al. (25Riquelme G. Morato E. Lopez E. Ruiz-Gomez A. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez Ros J.M. Mayor Jr., F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). An aliquot containing 100–150 μg of membrane protein was mixed with 2 ml of a 13 mm (in terms of lipid phosphorus) suspension of the asolectin vesicles. After the partial dehydration/rehydration cycle, the diameter of the resulting giant multilamellar liposomes ranged from 5 to 100 μm. Patch Clamp Measurements—Aliquots of 3–6 μl of giant liposomes were deposited into the excised Patch chamber (RC-28, Warner Instruments Corp.) and mixed with 0.4 ml of the buffer of choice for electrical recording (bath solution). Single-channel recordings were obtained by patch clamp techniques as described by Hamill et al. (26Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15195) Google Scholar). Giga seals were formed on giant liposomes with glass microelectrodes of 5 to 10 MΩ resistances. After sealing, withdrawal of the pipette from the liposome surface resulted in an excised patch. Current was recorded with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (Heka Elektronic, Lambrecht/Pfalzt, Germany) at a gain of 50–100 mV/pA and a filter setting of 10 kHz. The holding potential was applied to the interior of the patch pipette, and the bath was maintained at virtual ground (V = Vbath - Vpipette). The bath was grounded via an agar bridge, and the junction potential was compensated for when necessary. The signal was analyzed off-line by means of the analysis of single-channel recordings (Bruxton Corp.) and Pulse Fit (Heka Elektronic) software. All measurements were made at room temperature. Solutions—The pipette and bath solutions had the following composition (in mm): 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 2.6 calcium chloride, 1.3 magnesium chloride, and 10 sodium HEPES, pH 7.4, unless otherwise stated. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Measures of statistical significance were obtained using Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Cellular Localization of Annexin 6 in Normal Human Placenta—Our results show that every section of placental villous tissue from normal pregnant subjects at term exhibited immunostaining for annexin 6 in the apical and basal syncytiotrophoblast membranes (Fig. 1). The level of staining varied from mild to strong. We also observed expression in the fetal vascular endothelium (Fig. 1). Annexin 6 in MVM Isolated from Human Placenta—To demonstrate that annexin 6 is present in the purified MVM vesicles used in the electrophysiological studies, in the presence of the contaminating calcium and in the absence of EGTA, we performed Western blot analysis using a specific annexin 6 polyclonal antibody. As can be observed in Fig. 2, all the annexin 6 is located in the MVM fraction (pellet). These data suggest that during the normal isolation of the MVM, annexin 6 is bound to the membrane and it is not released into the media. To evaluate the calcium-specific properties of annexin 6 in the purified MVM, membranes were incubated 30 min on ice in the presence of a calcium chelator, EGTA. Pellets were washed and centrifuged, and annexin 6 levels were evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis, in the supernatant and in the new pellets (Fig. 2, EGTA). The results showed that the treatment with EGTA released some of the annexin 6 into the supernatant, which also suggests that there is a percentage of annexin 6 that binds the membranes in a calcium-independent fashion. To release all the annexin 6 it was necessary to use a detergent, saponin (Fig. 2, EGTA + saponin). It is known that saponin acts by removing cholesterol from the membrane. When apical membranes were isolated in the presence of 10 mm EGTA throughout the isolation, they contained almost 80% less annexin 6 than those isolated in the absence of the chelator (Fig. 3, A and B). These results confirm that annexin 6 is bound in the MVM placenta membranes in a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding manner but also in a calcium-independent fashion. Anti-annexin 6 Antibody Modulates the Maxi-chloride Channels from Human Placental MVM—The fact that annexin 6 is present in MVM suggested a possible role for annexin 6 in modulation of the Maxi-chloride channel present in these membranes. To explore this possibility, we evaluated the effect of anti-annexin 6 antibody on the activity of the Maxi-chloride channel by adding the antibody to the bath in excised patch recording of the Maxi-chloride channels. The Maxi-chloride channel was examined prior to and following the exposure of the seal to the antibody. The specificity of the inhibitory effect exerted by annexin 6 antibody was evaluated by comparing it to the inhibition produced by the preimmune serum. The experiments were carried out in symmetrical solutions where Cl- was the major permeated species. Each seal served as its own control with the current measured prior to and following exposure to either preimmune serum (normal goat serum) or annexin 6 antibody. The results presented here support the results previously reported in which we showed a typical activity of the large conductance of the chloride channels with different subconductance levels for the Maxi-chloride channel from MVM. Single channel current traces, at the indicated holding potential, for chloride channels are shown in Fig. 4. The trace in Fig. 4A shows control recordings of normal Maxi-chloride channels, and traces in Figs. 4B and 4C show the two more frequent behaviors for the recorded chloride currents with 5 μg/ml preimmune serum (normal goat serum) and with 5 μg/ml annexin 6 antibody in the bath solution, respectively, at 15 min following application. Both records show two types of electrical activity patterns for the Maxi-chloride channel in these conditions. The first one is similar to the control, suggesting that preimmune serum did not affect the electrical activity in the patch. However, when annexin 6 is presumably neutralized by antibody, there was a substantial change in the biophysical properties of the channel. To identify the biophysical characteristic of the affected conductance, the channel open probability (Po) was studied with neutralized and non-neutralized annexin 6 conditions. Effect of Annexin 6 Antibody on Total Current (Itotal) in the Patch—Addition of 5 μg/ml annexin 6 antibody to the bath solution decreased the total current in the patch by 39 ± 1.9% in the range of ± 80 mV (n = 4). However, the presence of 5 μg/ml preimmune serum (normal goat serum) did not affect the total current in the patch (n = 3). Fig. 5 show the results at the different experimental voltages applied in independent seals. The time course of total current (Itotal) in the patch shows that the current did not change with time either under control conditions (Fig. 6A) or in the presence of preimmune serum (5 μg/ml) (Fig. 6B). However, when the annexin 6 antibody (5 μg/ml) was added to the bath solution, the currents decreased with time (Fig. 6C).Fig. 6Time course on total current (Itotal) of the Maxi-chloride channel.A, control conditions; B, in the presence of 5 μg/ml preimmune serum; and C, in the presence 5 μg/ml annexin 6 antibody, to the bath solution at the indicated time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Unitary Conductances for Maxi-chloride Channels from Control versus Neutralized Annexin Condition—A linear current-potential relationship was obtained with reversal at 0 mV (Fig. 7A) for the control, the preimmune serum, or for annexin 6 antibody. Only the dominant current level was used, ignoring any subconductance levels for current-voltage relationships in each case. These conductances were observed in experiments performed with the bath and pipette solutions containing (in mm) 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.3 MgCl2, 10 Na-HEPES, and pH 7.4. As expected (27Henriquez M. Riquelme G. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Riquelme G. Parra M. Am. J. Obstet.

The activity recorded in the presence of preimmune serum in the bath did not show changes in conductance (251 ± 14 pS; n = 3). However the single-channel slope conductance in the presence of annexin 6 antibody decreased to 105 ± 13 pS (n = 4). The single-channel amplitude was affected by annexin 6 antibody, with a decrease of 50% (Fig. 7B). Open Probability (Po) for Maxi-chloride Channels from Control versus Neutralized Annexin Condition—The voltage dependence of open channel probability of apical chloride channels has been obtained as the ensemble-averaged current of 4–30 consecutive current responses to a voltage ramp pulse applied in independent seals. These Po values were calculated as Po = (I/V)/Gmax, where I is the patch current, V is the voltage, and Gmax is the maximal patch conductance near 0 mV. A voltage ramp pulse was usually applied from -120 mV to +120 mV, at a rate of 40 mV/s. Fig. 8 shows the curve for Poversus voltage for these results. In agreement with the characteristics of Po reported before for the placental Maxi-chloride channel from normal placenta (9Brown P.D. Greenwood S.L. Robinson J. Boyd R.D. Placenta. 1993; 14: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Henriquez M. Riquelme G. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Riquelme G. Parra M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 180: 469-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) the open probability (Po) versus voltage relationship for our normal contemporaneous controls (n = 5) could be described by a bell-shaped curve. The channel was normally open at potentials between -50 and +50 mV, and voltage increases in either a positive or negative direction induced channel closure. A similar situation was observed in the presence of preimmune serum in the bath. In the presence of annexin 6 antibody the channel was also normally open at potentials between -50 mV and +50 mV; however, at higher voltage steps, in either a positive or negative direction, no channel closures were induced. Po did not decrease; it is maintained at 1 at ±40 mV and 1 at ±80 mV in channels with neutralized annexin 6, compared with Po that diminished from ∼1 at ±40 mV to 0.6 at ±80 mV in the control condition. As shown in Fig. 8, the bell-shaped curve of voltage dependence of Po for neutralized annexin 6 is flattened with respect to that of control, i.e. chloride-conducting channels with neutralized annexin 6 lost a voltage dependence of Po. The immunohistochemistry results presented in this study support previous published data by other investigators that showed that annexin 6 is expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta. However, in distinction to other studies, we find that annexin 6 is specifically localized in the apical and basal membrane of the placenta syncytiotrophoblast. The expression of annexin 6 at the plasma membrane level suggests a potential role in the plasma membrane activity. Because we have previously identified Maxi-chloride channels in the apical membrane of the human placentae, we decided to evaluate whether annexin 6, which is highly expressed in the apical membrane, regulates the electrophysiological properties of the Maxi-chloride channel. Our approach was to use a polyclonal anti-annexin 6 antibody to neutralize the annexin 6 protein bound to the apical membrane phospholipids. The use of specific antibodies to block intracellular function of annexin family members has previously been reported (16Chan H.C. Kaetzel M.A. Gotter A.L. Dedman J.R. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32464-32468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Diaz-Munoz M. Hamilton S.L. Kaetzel M.A. Hazarika P. Dedman J.R. J. Biol.

We used apical membrane reconstitution into giant liposomes to evaluate the role of this protein on the regulation of the Maxi-chloride channel. We first evaluated whether expression of the protein was affected by the isolation protocol for apical and basal placental membranes. Our results showed that the apical membrane fraction contained high levels of annexin 6. However, when we tried to isolate an apical membrane in the absence of annexins by adding EGTA to the preparation (28Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 15Seaton B.A. Dedman J.R. Biometals. 1998; 11: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Swairjo M.A. Seaton B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 193-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we observed both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent binding of annexin 6. When the levels of annexin 6 were compared between samples prepared in the absence and in the presence of EGTA, we observed an ∼85% release of annexin 6 suggesting that 15% of the annexin 6 is bound to the apical membrane in a calcium-independent fashion. This observation agrees with results previously reported by de Diego and collaborators who showed that changes in the distribution and concentration of cholesterol within the endosomal compartment regulate, together with phospholipids, the annexin 6 localization and potentially its function (30de Diego I. Schwartz F. Siegfried H. Dauterstedt P. Heeren J. Beisiegel U. Enrich C. Grewal T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32187-32194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This calcium-independent binding could be also attributed to a decrease on the intracellular pH as was shown for Golzak and collaborators (31Golczak M. Kirilenko A. Bandorowicz-Pikula J. Pikula S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). They showed that lowering the pH increased the hydrophobicity of annexin 6, allowing its interaction with membrane lipids in a calcium-independent manner. Another alternative is that annexin 6 binds to the cytoskeleton, as reported by Babiychuk and collaborators (13Babiychuk E.B. Palstra R.J. Schaller J. Kampfer U. Draeger A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2079560131,"In rat kidney, two alternatively spliced transcripts are generated from the V2 vasopressin receptor gene. The large transcript (1.2 kb) encodes the canonical V2 receptor, whereas the small transcript encodes a splice variant displaying a distinct sequence corresponding to the putative seventh transmembrane domain and the intracellular C terminus of the V2 receptor. This work showed that the small spliced transcript is translated in the rat kidney collecting tubules. However, the protein encoded by the small transcript (here called the V2b splice variant) is retained inside the cell, in contrast to the preferential surface distribution of the V2 receptor (here called the V2a receptor). Cells expressing the V2b splice variant do not exhibit binding to 3H-labeled vasopressin. Interestingly, we found that expression of the splice variant V2b down-regulates the surface expression of the V2a receptor, most likely via the formation of V2a·V2b heterodimers as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments between the V2a receptor and the V2b splice variant. The V2b splice variant would then be acting as a dominant negative. The effect of the V2b splice variant is specific, as it does not affect the surface expression of the G protein-coupled interleukin-8 receptor (CXCR1). Furthermore, the sequence encompassing residues 242–339, corresponding to the C-terminal domain of the V2b splice variant, also down-regulates the surface expression of the V2a receptor. We suggest that some forms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus are due to overexpression of the splice variant V2b, which could retain the wild-type V2a receptor inside the cell via the formation of V2a·V2b heterodimers.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) 1The abbreviations used are: AVP, arginine vasopressin; CFP, cyan fluorescence protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary (cells); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FRET, fluorescence resonance-energy transfer; GFP, green fluorescence protein; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney (cells).1The abbreviations used are: AVP, arginine vasopressin; CFP, cyan fluorescence protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary (cells); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FRET, fluorescence resonance-energy transfer; GFP, green fluorescence protein; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney (cells). is a nonapeptide secreted by the pituitary gland and a major regulator of fluid and electrolyte balance and cardiovascular function (1Szczepanska-Sadowska E. Regul. Pept. 1996; 66: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2González C.B. Figueroa C.D. Biol. Res. 1999; 32: 63-76PubMed Google Scholar). There are at least three vasopressin receptor subtypes, V1,V2, and V3, encoded by distinct genes (3Birnbaumer M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 406-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These receptors are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion; V1, V2, and V3 receptors are preferentially expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, kidney, and pituitary gland, respectively (4Thibonnier M. Berti-Mattera L.N. Dulin N. Conarty D.M. Mattera R. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 119: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The V2 vasopressin receptor is coupled to adenylyl cyclase, whereas V1 and V3 receptors are preferentially coupled to phospholipase C. Activation of V2 receptors increases the intracellular level of cAMP, which, in turn, triggers the recruitment of water channels (aquaporin 2) in the plasma membrane to stimulate water reabsorption (5Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Importantly, mutations in the V2 receptor are responsible for the X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (6Birbaumer M. Arch. Med. Res. 1999; 30: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that G protein-coupled receptors can form homodimers or heterodimers between related receptors, which may expand their functional diversity (7Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). For example, γ-aminobutyric acid B receptor subtypes appear to form heterodimers inside the cells. Similar findings have been also reported with regard to taste receptor subtypes, suggesting that heterodimerization of these receptors is required for their targeting to the cell surface. Vasopressin receptors of different subtypes form homodimers and heterodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that dimerization takes place during receptor synthesis (8Terrillon S. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Breit A. Ayoub M.A. Taulan M. Jockers R. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the dimerization of vasopressin receptors is unknown, but it seems that homodimerization or heterodimerization of these receptors does not affect their signaling mechanisms, although recent studies indicate that heterodimerization of V1a and V2 vasopressin receptors regulate their trafficking profiles (9Terrillon S. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1548-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The V2 vasopressin receptor gene consists of three exons and two introns (Fig 1A). The first exon encodes the first nine amino acids of the N terminus, the second exon encodes transmembrane domains I–VI, and the third exon encodes transmembrane domain VII and the C-terminal domain (10Seibold A. Brabet P. Rosenthal W. Birnbaumer M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 51: 1078-1083PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse transcription PCR of RNA from isolated kidney tubules showed two transcripts, a major 1.2-kb transcript corresponding to the sequence encoding the V2 receptor and a splice variant of 1.1 kb. (Fig 1B) This variant encodes an identical amino acid sequence to the V2 receptor up to residue 303; however, the downstream sequence of the splice variant encodes a distinct amino acid sequence from the seventh transmembrane domain to the C terminus of the V2 receptor (Fig 1C). The splice variant was generated by an alternative splicing at a site 76 bp downstream of the V2 receptor splice site, resulting in a frameshift in the 3′-end coding region. The mRNA of the splice variant is expressed in the collecting tubules at ∼15% that of the major V2 receptor (11Firsov D. Mandon B. Morel A. Merot J. Le Maout S. Bellanger A.C. de Rouffignac C. Elalouf J.M. Buhler J.M. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 429: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this work, we showed that the splice variant mRNA is translated into a protein (here called V2b) but is retained inside the cell. Most importantly, we showed that the V2b protein forms heterodimers with the wild-type V2 receptor (here called V2a) and acts as a dominant negative by sequestering V2a receptors inside the cells. Reagents—AVP was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA), [3H]AVP came from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and the monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rat monoclonal anti-HA (3F10) and FuGENE 6 were from Roche Diagnostics, and Ultraspec RNA came from Biotecx (Houston, TX). Enhanced chemiluminescence solutions and the secondary anti-rabbit peroxidase-labeled antibody were from Pierce. The reporter vectors ECFP-N1, EGFP-N1, and EYFP-N1 were from BD Biosciences Clontech. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's medium, penicillin G, streptomycin sulfate, and Fungizone were from Invitrogen. The cDNAs encoding the wild-type V2a vasopressin receptor and the splice variant were synthesized by reverse transcription PCR using rat kidney RNA along with a sense primer (5′-ggaattcggtgtgttaggtcatcatcaa-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-gctctagacagttgagctacagagggttt-3′). Both cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA 3.1. To create expression plasmids encoding fusion proteins, the wild-type V2a receptor cDNA was amplified with a sense primer (5′-ggaattcggtgtgttaggtcatcatcaa-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-acgcgtcgacgtggagggtgtatcc-3′); the splice variant cDNA was amplified with the same sense primer and the antisense primer 5′-acgcgtcgacgtaagaggagctgg-3′. These amplified products were subcloned in-frame to the cDNAs encoding the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein or the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein of the reporter vectors. Transient and Stable Transfections—COS-1 and MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. CHO K1 cells were grown in F12 Ham's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone. CHO-K1 cells seeded in 24-well plates at 6 × 104 cells/well were transiently transfected with 0.2 μg of V2a·GFP cDNA and/or V2b·GFP cDNA per well, 0.4 μg of CXCR1 cDNA, 0.4 μg of CXCR1 plus V2b cDNA (3:1 ratio), 0.4 μg of V2b or the V2a 242 tail (the cDNA encoding from residue 242 to residue 371 of the V2a receptor), or the V2b 242 tail (the cDNA encoding from residue 242 to 329 of the V2b splice variant) plus pcDNA3 vector (1:3 ratio) per well using FuGENE 6 at a 2:3 (w/w) ratio. MDCK cells were stably transfected with V2a·GFP cDNA and/or V2b·GFP cDNA using FuGENE 6, and cell clones were selected with 700 μg/ml Geneticin and by fluorescence microscopy. Immunocytochemistry—Rat kidney tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, deparaffinized, dehydrated, and treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were incubated with anti-peptide antibodies directed against the V2a C-terminal peptide (QRHTTHSLGPQDESCATASSSLMKDTPS) or with antibodies directed against the V2b C-terminal peptide (HTAWVLKMNPVPQP). Bound antibodies were detected using an avidin-biotin kit (LSAB+; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Peroxidase activity was detected with 0.1% (w/v) 3–3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.03% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide for 5 min at room temperature. For the immunofluorescence studies, cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding V2a tagged with an HA epitope at its N terminus and V2b tagged with cyan fluorescence protein (CFP) at its C terminus. After 48 h of transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with cold methanol. Cells were stained with anti-HA monoclonal antibody to detect the expression of V2a. Fluorescence in the cells was analyzed in a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Subcellular Fractionation—Stably transfected MDCK cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and disrupted with a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose and the protease inhibitors leupeptin and aprotinin (10 μg/ml each). The cell homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 6,000 × g. The post-nuclear supernatant was adjusted to 1.3 m sucrose and overlaid on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (2 ml each of 1.2, 1.15, 0.86, and 0.25 m sucrose) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and centrifuged for 18 h at 24,000 rpm in a SW 40 Ti rotor. One-milliliter fractions were collected from the bottom, diluted four times, and centrifuged for 45 min at 150,000 × gav. Subcellular distribution of each fraction was analyzed by Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal anti-Na+/K+-ATPase (Rockland Immunochemicals), anti-calnexin (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and anti Golgi-97 (Molecular Probes) antibodies to identify plasma membrane, ER, and Golgi-enriched membranes, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation—COS-1 cells were co-transfected with two plasmids, one containing the cDNA encoding the V2a receptor tagged with GFP and the other containing the cDNA encoding the V2b splice variant tagged with HA. After 48 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in a 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 15 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin (each). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 6,000 × g, and the post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged for 45 min at 150,000 × gav. The membrane pellet was solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P40, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged for 45 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated with a polyclonal anti-GFP (2.5 μg) and 20 μl of agarose-protein A slurry at 4 °C for 16 h. The immunoabsorbent was washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 1,000 × g. The immune complexes were resuspended in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot. Co-immunoprecipitation of HAV2b was detected using a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody and a peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rat antibody (Jackson Laboratories). Confocal Microscopy—Stably transfected MDCK cells were grown on coverslips for 2 weeks to achieve cell polarization. After washing the cells twice with Krebs-Ringer HEPES (136 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, and 1.25 mm glucose), the coverslips were mounted in a camera to examine the cells in an LSM 510 Meta confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss) in the Optical Imaging Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch. The cells were excited with the laser at 488 nm, and the light emitted was detected using an LP 514 filter. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—COS-1 cells seeded at 5 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish were transiently co-transfected with a pair of plasmids (2 μg of each plasmid), V2a·CFP or V2b·CFP and either V2a·YFP or V2b·YFP. After 48 h, the coverslips were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer Hepes (136 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, and 1.25 mm glucose) and mounted in the camera of a LSM 510 Zeiss confocal laser-scanning microscope. FRET was monitored by the three filter set procedure described by Gordon et al. (12Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The donor filter set (D) is composed of a laser for excitation (458 nm), a main beam splitter (HFT 458/514), and secondary beam splitters (NFT 545 and NFT 515). The light emitted by the donor was detected with a 475–525-nm bandpass filter. The acceptor filter set (A) consisted of a laser for excitation (514 nm), a main beam splitter (HFT 458/514), and secondary beam splitters (NFT 570 and NFT 515). The light emitted by the acceptor was detected with a LP 530 filter. The FRET filter set (F) consisted of a laser for excitation (458 nm), corresponding to the absorption spectrum of the donor and the beam splitters described above. The FRET signal was obtained recorded using an LP 530 filter. To normalize FRET (FRETN), the background given by the images from non-transfected cells was subtracted from the images from transfected cells, and the resulting images were processed by the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) according to the formula shown in Equation 1,FRETN=Ff−Df(FdDd)−Af(FaAa)Af[GDf+Ff−Df(FdDd)−Af(FaAa)](Eq. 1) in which we use the two-letter symbols proposed by Gordon et al. in 1998 (12Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Aa and Fa represent images obtained with the Acceptor and FRET filter sets, respectively, when only the acceptor fluorophore is present in the sample, whereas Dd and Fd represent images obtained with the Donor and FRET filter sets, respectively, with the donor fluorophore. Ff, Af, and Df represent images obtained with the FRET, Acceptor, and Donor filter sets, respectively, when both fluorophores are present. G is a factor that relates the loss of donor emission due to FRET in the Donor filter set to the gain of acceptor emission due to FRET in the FRET filter set. Binding Assays—Transfected CHO-K1 cells were washed three times with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.0 mm NaPO4, 0.9 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mg/ml glucose, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 165 ng/ml phenylalanine. For saturation binding studies, cells were incubated for 2 h with increasing concentrations of [3H]AVP in the absence or the presence of 10 μm unlabeled AVP. The reaction was terminated by washing the cells twice with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested by incubation with 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C. Radioactivity was determined in a Packard scintillation β-counter. Data were analyzed by using the Sigma plot program (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) with the ligand binding plug-in. Binding is reported as the average of triplicates. Each experiment was performed at least three times. For binding in crude membranes, transfected cells were disrupted with a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer in 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.3 mm EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 6,000 × g, and the crude membranes were harvested by centrifuging the post-nuclear supernatant for 40 min at 150,000 × gav. Crude membranes (30 μg of protein) were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 4 nm [3H]AVP in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in a 250-μl final volume. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration through a Whatman GF/C glass fiber filter. Subcellular Localization of V2a Receptor and the Splice Variant V2b—As described previously (11Firsov D. Mandon B. Morel A. Merot J. Le Maout S. Bellanger A.C. de Rouffignac C. Elalouf J.M. Buhler J.M. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 429: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), reverse transcription PCR with total RNA of rat kidney showed co-expression of two transcripts encoding two potential V2 receptor subtypes (Fig. 1B). The large transcript of 1.2 kb encodes the classical V2 receptor (V2a), whereas the small transcript of 1.1 kb encodes the splice variant V2b. The latter displays an identical sequence to the V2a receptor up to residue 303. However, because of the frameshift, the splice variant displays a short and distinct sequence from the corresponding seventh transmembrane and C terminus domains of the wild-type V2a receptor (Fig. 1C). Here, we showed by the immunostaining of rat kidney cells with subtype-specific antibodies that V2a receptors are preferentially expressed in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A), whereas the splice variant V2b is broadly distributed in the cell (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, MDCK cells expressing the V2a receptor·GFP fusion protein exhibited significant fluorescence in both the perinuclear region and the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A). In contrast, cells expressing the splice variant V2b·GFP fusion protein revealed fluorescence only in the cytoplasmic region without any significant labeling in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). Consistent with these findings, CHO cells expressing V2a receptors exhibited cell surface [3H]AVP high affinity binding, whereas cells expressing the splice variant V2b displayed negligible high affinity binding to [3H]AVP (Fig. 3C). This finding is in good agreement with the intense fluorescence displayed by permeabilized cells expressing the V2b splice variant tagged with HA at its N terminus (Fig 4A), which is in contrast to the negligible fluorescence displayed by the corresponding non-permeabilized cells (Fig 4B). As expected, non-permeabilized cells expressing the HA-tagged V2a receptor showed intense fluorescence (Fig 4C). These results indicate that the splice variant is retained inside the cells. To identify the location of the splice variant inside the cell, we performed subcellular fractionation. The V2b splice variant preferentially localizes in the ER/Golgi enriched fractions, as monitored with the specific markers for ER (calnexin) and Golgi (Golgin-97). On the other hand, V2a localized in all the fractions, including the plasma membrane-enriched fraction, as monitored by the Na+/K+-ATPase as a marker (Fig. 5). These data indicates that V2b is unable to traffic to the plasma membrane because it is retained in the ER/Golgi compartment. It is likely that the V2b splice lacks the sorting signals to traffic to the plasma membrane. Indeed, the seventh transmembrane domain and the C-terminal region of the V2 receptor have been shown to play key roles in the trafficking of this receptor (13Bouley R. Sun T.X. Chenard M.

To determine whether the V2b splice variant still retains the ability to bind AVP, we performed binding assays in cell homogenates. As shown in Fig. 6, AVP exhibits negligible binding to homogenates from cells expressing the splice variant, whereas high affinity AVP binding is observed in homogenates from cell expressing the V2a receptor.Fig. 3Subcellular distribution of the V2a receptor and the V2b splice variant and [3H]AVP binding in transfected cells.

We found FRET signals in cells expressing the V2a·CFP/V2a·YFP and V2a·CFP/V2b·YFP pairs as displayed in pseudo color mode intensity, where white areas indicate high values of FRET and black areas indicate low values of FRET. In agreement with previous studies, V2a receptors form homodimers inside the cells (8Terrillon S. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Breit A. Ayoub M.A. Taulan M. Jockers R. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) as demonstrated by the large FRET signal (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, the V2a receptor and the splice variant form heterodimers inside the cell (Fig. 7B). Only a low FRET signal was detected in cells expressing the unfused (control) fluorescence proteins CFP and YFP (Fig. 7C), indicating little interaction between these proteins. Quantitative fluorescence analysis showed that cells expressing V2a·CFP/V2a·YFP and V2a·CFP/V2b·YFP pairs had a ∼6-fold higher FRET signal than cells expressing CFP and YFP (Fig. 7D). We also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that the V2a receptor and the V2b splice isoform oligomerize. As shown in Fig. 8, a HA-tagged V2b splice variant can be immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies from extracts of cells expressing both the splice variant and the GFP-tagged V2a receptor.Fig. 8Co-immunoprecipitation of the V2a receptor with the V2b splice variant. COS-1 cells co-expressing the V2aGFP and the HAV2b (lane 1) or individually expressing the HAV2b (lane 2)orV2aGFP (lane 3) were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-GFP/protein A-agarose. Western blots of the immunoprecipitates were stained with anti-HA antibody. Lane 4 shows a Western blot of the extract from cells expressing the HAV2b splice variant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Splice Variant V2b Down-regulates the Surface Expression of the V2a Receptor—Because the splice variant V2b forms heterodimers with V2a receptors inside the cell, we investigated whether this splice variant regulates the trafficking of V2a receptors. The surface expression of V2a receptors was monitored by measuring [3H]AVP binding in CHO cells transfected with cDNAs encoding the V2a receptor and the splice variant V2b. We found that the surface expression of V2a receptors was abrogated by increasing the expression of the splice variant V2b (Fig. 9). Interestingly, the total cell expression of the V2a receptors was unaffected by the expression of the splice variant as demonstrated by Western blotting of the V2a·GFP fusion protein using anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 9, inset). Further analysis of the binding data indicates that the dissociation constant (Kd) of the binding of [3H]AVP to the V2a receptor was unaffected by the expression of the splice variant; however, Bmax decreased by almost 3-fold (Fig 10A). These findings indicate that the splice variant V2b down-regulates the surface expression of the V2a receptor, which is retained inside the cells, probably as V2a·V2b receptor heterodimers. We also tested whether the receptor C-terminal domain also regulates V2 receptor trafficking, as that domain rescued V2 receptor mutants (14Schoneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15Schulz A. Grosse R. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2381-2389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We found that the sequence encompassing residues 242–339 of the splice variant V2b down-regulates the surface expression of the V2a receptor (Fig. 10B), but not with the corresponding sequence 242–371 of the V2a receptor (Fig. 10C). These results suggest that the region comprising the sixth transmembrane domain is part of the dimer interface, whereas the seventh transmembrane domain and the C terminus contain the sorting motifs for translocation of the receptor to the plasma membrane. We also demonstrate that the down-regulation of the V2a receptor by the splice variant is specific, as the surface expression of the G protein-coupled receptor CXCR1 (interleukin-8 receptor A, a chemokine receptor) was unaffected on CHO cells co-transfected with cDNAs encoding CXCR1 and the splice variant V2b (Fig. 10D).Fig. 10The V2b splice variant and the C-terminal partial sequence of V2b reduced specifically the number of [3H]AVP binding sites of CHO cells expressing the V2a receptor. A, saturation [3H]AVP binding to CHO cells expressing V2a receptors (•) or V2a receptors plus the V2b splice variant (○). B, [3H]AVP binding to CHO cells expressing the V2a receptor (•), the V2a receptor plus the V2b splice variant (○), or the V2a receptor and a V2b 242 tail (▾).

D, [125I] interleukin-8 binding to CHO cells expressing a V2b splice variant (•), an interleukin-8 receptor (CXCR1; ▪), or CXCR1 plus the V2b splice variant (▾).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast to the preferential distribution of the V2a receptor to the cell surface, we demonstrate that the translated splice variant V2b transcript is retained in ER/Golgi compartments, as shown by subcellular fractionation analysis. Although the V2b splice variant is normally expressed in the kidney, its functional significance does not appear to be related to its signaling or binding to AVP, as this splice variant did not exhibit high affinity binding to [3H]AVP. However, we found that the expression of the splice variant down-regulates the surface expression of the V2a receptor. V2a receptors form both homodimers and heterodimers with V2b, as demonstrated by FRET experiments and co-immunoprecipitation studies between V2a receptor and the V2b splice variant. These findings are consistent with the view that the V2b splice variant down-regulates the surface expression of the V2a receptor by forming V2a·V2b heterodimers, which are then retained inside the cells. The splice variant V2b would be then acting as a dominant negative. The effect of V2b is specific, as it does not affect the surface expression of CXCR1. Furthermore, the sequence encompassing residues 242–339 of the V2b receptor mimics the down-regulation of the V2a receptor by the full-length splice variant, suggesting that the sixth transmembrane segment of these receptors is part of the dimerization interface. Similar effects have been reported in other G protein-coupled receptors, e.g. a splice variant of the calcitonin receptor lacking 14-residues of the seventh transmembrane segment prevented the surface expression of the wild-type receptor (16Seck T. Baron R. Horne W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23085-23093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism underlying the retention of the V2a receptor by the splice variant V2b is unknown. On the basis of current information about the folding and trafficking of proteins, we reasoned that the V2a·V2b heterodimer complex may be improperly folded to be processed and transported to the plasma membrane. Indeed, misfolded mutants of V2 receptors that cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus accumulate inside the cells but can be rescued by non-peptide antagonists of the V2 receptor (17Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Petaja-Repo U. Angers S. Morin D. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). It is argued that the binding of the V2 receptor antagonist stabilizes the folded conformation of the receptor and primes it for processing and transport to the cell surface. Also, misfolded rhodopsin mutants causing retinal degeneration interfere with the processing and transport of the wild-type rhodopsin (18Colley N.J. Cassill J.A. Baker E.K. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3070-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The best-studied system is the improperly folded ΔF508 mutant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which is retained inside the cell (19Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However this misfolded mutant can be rescued by organic solutes that stabilize its folded conformation (20Zhang X.M.

All of these disorders belong to a group of misfolding diseases that include Alzheimer's disease, prion encephalopathies, Parkinson's disease, and some cancers (21Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V.

This model of retention of the misfolded receptor complex inside the cell would be consistent with the down-regulation of the wild-type V2a receptor by a misfolded splice variant V2b (27Zhu X.

We suggest that the fragment encompassing residues 242–339 of the splice variant is misfolded, as expression of this fragment is sufficient to down-regulate the surface expression of the V2a receptor. Our findings support the idea that dimerization of V2a receptors inside the cell stabilizes the folded structure of the receptor for processing and transport to the plasma membrane, whereas heterodimerization of the splice variant V2b with the wild-type V2a receptor gives rise to a misfolded V2a·V2b complex, which is retained inside the cell. It is possible that some forms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may be due to the overexpression of the splice variant V2b, which retains the wild-type V2a receptor inside the cell via the formation of V2a·V2b heterodimers.

https://openalex.org/W2117939677,"For successful chromosome segregation during mitosis, several processes must occur early in the cell cycle, including spindle pole duplication, DNA replication, and the establishment of cohesion between nascent sister chromatids. Spindle pole body duplication begins in G1 and continues during early S-phase as spindle pole bodies mature and start to separate. Key steps in spindle pole body duplication are the sequential recruitment of Cdc31p and Spc42p by the nuclear envelope transmembrane protein Msp3p/Nep98p (herein termed Mps3p). Concurrent with DNA replication, Ctf7p/Eco1p (herein termed Ctf7p) ensures that nascent sister chromatids are paired together, identifying the products of replication as sister chromatids. Here, we provide the first evidence that the nuclear envelope spindle pole body assembly component Mps3p performs a function critical to sister chromatid cohesion. Mps3p was identified as interacting with Ctf7p from a genome-wide two-hybrid screen, and the physical interaction was confirmed by both in vivo (co-immunoprecipitation) and in vitro (GST pull-down) assays. An in vivo cohesion assay on new mps3/nep98 alleles revealed that loss of Mps3p results in precocious sister chromatid separation and that Mps3p functions after G1, coincident with Ctf7p. Mps3p is not required for cohesion during mitosis, revealing that Mps3p functions in cohesion establishment and not maintenance. Mutated Mps3p that results in cohesion defects no longer binds to Ctf7p in vitro, demonstrating that the interaction between Mps3p and Ctf7p is physiologically relevant. In support of this model, mps3 ctf7 double mutant cells exhibit conditional synthetic lethality. These findings document a new role for Mps3p in sister chromatid cohesion and provide novel insights into the mechanism by which a spindle pole body component, when mutated, contributes to aneuploidy.

Microtubule-organizing center duplication, separation, and microtubule nucleation are all essential facets of proper chromosome segregation. In budding yeast, microtubule-organizing centers, called spindle pole bodies, function on both sides of the nuclear envelope to nucleate microtubules in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear volumes. Spindle pole body duplication is a multistep process that includes formation of a satellite, expansion into a cytoplasmic duplication plaque, half-bridge growth, and subsequent insertion into the nuclear envelope (1Winey M. O'Toole E.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E23-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 2Adams I.R. Kilmartin J.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Evidence from genetic and electron microscopy studies indicates that spindle pole body duplication starts in G1 and continues into early S-phase. Mps3p/Nep98p (herein termed Mps3p) is an essential nuclear envelope protein that is concentrated at the nuclear envelope half-bridge and required for spindle pole body assembly. Early in spindle pole body assembly, Mps3p functions to recruit and anchor Cdc31p to the half-bridge. Later, Mps3p is required for integration of Spc42p into the spindle pole duplication plaque (3Jaspersen S.L. Giddings Jr., T.H. Winey M. J.

Biol. 2000; 49: 105-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During S-phase, each chromosome replicates to produce two identical sister chromatids. To identify the products of DNA replication as sister chromatids, sisters become paired along their entire length. The initial pairing process, or cohesion establishment, ensures that cohesion occurs exclusively between sister chromatids while precluding the pairing of nonsister chromatids, homologous chromosomes, or highly repetitive DNA sequences (6Koshland D.E. Guacci V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Nasmyth K. Peters J.M. Uhlmann F.

Whereas the molecular mechanism by which cohesion is established remains unknown, it is clear that establishment is intimately coupled to DNA replication. Previously, we reported that the cohesion establishment factor CTF7/ECO1 (herein termed CTF7) genetically interacts with both POL30 (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and CHL12/CTF18 (an RFC homolog) (9Skibbens R.V.

Here, we report on new findings that a nuclear envelope protein required for spindle pole body assembly also functions in sister chromatid cohesion. Several independent lines of evidence reveal that Mps3p physically associates with Ctf7p, a cohesion establishment factor. New mps3 alleles were generated and used to show that Mps3p indeed functions in cohesion and that this activity occurs after the G1 portion of the cell cycle. These findings reveal that a spindle pole body assembly factor performs a function that is critical to sister chromatid cohesion and proper chromosome segregation.

Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pJL59 was linearized with ClaI and ligated in the presence of CTF7 obtained by BstBI digestion of pBS2 (9Skibbens R.V. Corson L.B. Koshland D. Hieter P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). CTF7 inserted in the reverse orientation was also obtained. Two-hybrid analyses were performed as described (29Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3900) Google Scholar). Proper functioning of Gal4(BD)-Ctf7p was confirmed by transformation into a ctf7 deletion strain containing (pRS316-CTF7). All transformants remained viable on medium supplemented with 5′-FOA 1The abbreviations used are: 5′-FOA, 5′-fluoroorotic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; HA, hemagglutinin; BD, binding domain; AD, activation domain. to counterselect for the pRS316-based plasmid (30Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). In contrast, transformants harboring either Gal4(BD) vector alone or vector with CTF7 placed in the reverse orientation were inviable upon 5′-FOA exposure. GST Pull-downs—GST-CTF7 expression in Escherichia coli cells was performed as previously described (14Kenna M.A. Skibbens R.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2999-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells containing Mps3-13MYCp, Mps3Δ60-13MYC, or Mps3-3-13MYCp were spheroplasted in 100T Zymolyase (Seikagaku), lysed by swelling and mechanical disruption (20 mm HEPES-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors), and centrifuged at 9500 rpm for 45 min (model JA-20; Beckman). The supernatant was removed, and the insoluble chromatin pellet was extracted with lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl before recentrifugation. The salt-extracted supernatant was then harvested and divided into four equal aliquots, one of which was precipitated with tricholoroaceticic acid and then resuspended in Laemmli buffer. The other three aliquots were each diluted 10-fold in lysis buffer (to reduce the salt concentration) prior to incubation with one of the three bead matrices (glutathione-Sepharose beads or beads coupled to GST or GST-Ctf7p). Incubations were performed at either 4 °C for 2 h or 37 °C for 30 min. The treated beads were washed several times before bound proteins were removed using SDS-containing solubilization buffer. During Western blot analyses, the MYC epitope was visualized using monoclonal anti-c-MYC 9E10 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells containing Mps3-MYCp were transformed with either Ctf7-HAp or HA only vector control 2-μm plasmids. Transformed cells were grown to log phase and then lysed with glass beads. The lysate was centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was treated with lysis buffer supplemented to 1 m NaCl and centrifuged, and the resulting salt-extracted supernatant was harvested for immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described with minor modifications (14Kenna M.A. Skibbens R.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2999-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, supernatants were diluted in Buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), incubated with A-14 polyclonal anti-MYC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C, and then incubated with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. A parallel sample was also treated with Protein A-Sepharose beads without anti-MYC antibody. In both cases, beads were washed with Buffer A several times using low speed centrifugation, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS solubilization buffer. Western blot analysis was carried out using Y-11 monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of mps3 Mutant Alleles—PCR mutagenesis was performed using pSJ140 (pRS316-MPS3; generously provided by Drs. S. Jaspersen and M. Winey) as DNA template and limiting amounts of dNTPs as previously described (9Skibbens R.V. Corson L.B. Koshland D. Hieter P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 31Kassenbrock C.K. Cao W. Douglas M.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3023-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). NcoI and NdeI were used to release a 1.9-kbp fragment from pRS315-MPS3. The remaining vector and PCR product were then co-transformed into a yeast strain containing an MPS3 knockout with KAN covered by pSJ140. Approximately 6000 transformants were plated to medium containing 5′-FOA to counterselect against pSJ140 (30Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The remaining transformants (harboring potentially PCR-mutated MPS3 as the sole source of Mps3p function) were placed on rich medium at 23 and 37 °C and scored for temperature sensitivity. From a total of six temperature-sensitive mps3 strains identified, plasmids were recovered from the four tightest temperature-sensitive alleles. These mps3 alleles were cloned into an integrating vector (pRS402), linearized to promote integration at the ADE2 loci, and transformed into the MPS3-KAN knockout yeast strain covered by pSJ140. Transformants were then plated to medium containing 5′-FOA to counterselect against pSJ140, leaving the integrated PCR-mutagenized mps3 alleles as the sole source of Mps3p function. Stably transfected cells were then placed on rich medium at 23 and 37 °C and scored for temperature sensitivity. All four mutants retained temperature sensitivity and were named mps3-2, mps3-3, mps3-4, and mps3-5. Cohesion Assay—Our modified cohesion assay strain was previously described (13Mayer M.L. Gygi S.P. Aebersold R. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 959-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 14Kenna M.A. Skibbens R.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2999-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Briefly, Tet operator repeats integrated ∼40 kb from the centromere of chromosome V are detected via binding of the stably integrated GFP-Tet repressor. In addition, Pds1–13MYCp expression allows identification of preanaphase cells by immunofluorescence on a cell-by-cell basis. This cohesion assay strain was crossed with our stably integrated mps3-3 allele strain, sporulated, and dissected. Spores harboring the appropriate markers were then assayed for cohesion defects. Log phase cells were arrested in G1 using α factor, washed, and released into 37 °C rich medium containing nocodazole. Mitotic arrested cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence to visualize Pds1p (A-14 anti-MYC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR)), DNA (DAPI), and GFP. DNA content was assessed by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACSCAN. For the cohesion assay performed on both α-factor and nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 5), each 3-h data point represents >400 individual Pds1p-staining cells averaged from four independent experiments. Each 5-h data point represents 100 individual cells per strain. To test for cohesion maintenance, each data point represents 200 individual cells averaged from two independent experiments. Spindle Pole Body Duplication Assay—Log phase wild type and ctf7 mutant cells were placed in 23 °C rich medium supplemented with nocodazole for 3 h. The mitotic arrested cells were washed two times in 37 °C medium and allowed to proceed through the cell cycle at this temperature (restrictive for ctf7-203). Samples were harvested every 30 min and processed for flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Time points in which both wild type and ctf7 cells were judged to have traversed the cell cycle and reenter mitosis were further processed to detect Tub4p and α-tubulin (anti-Tub4p a generous gift from S. Jaspersen and M. Winey; B512 anti-α-tubulin was purchased from Sigma). Only large budded cells (bud size roughly one-half of mother) were counted. Cells in which Tub4p was not detected were also not counted. Results shown represent averages for three independent time courses in which at least 50 cells were counted for each time point. Genome-wide Two-hybrid Screen Identifies Mps3p as Associating with Ctf7p—Ctf7p is an essential yeast protein that functions to establish cohesion between sister chromatids (9Skibbens R.V. Corson L.B. Koshland D. Hieter P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 21Toth A. Ciosk R. Uhlmann F. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To identify novel cohesion establishment factors, we performed a genome-wide two-hybrid screen. The CTF7 open reading frame (encoding for amino acids 26–281) was fused in-frame 3′ to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) sequence (28James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed as the sole source of Ctf7p function in yeast, Gal4(BD)-Ctf7p rescues ctf7Δ strain viability. These results indicate that the Gal4(BD)-Ctf7p chimera is functional in vivo and further reveals that amino acids 1–25 are not essential for Ctf7p function. Prior to performing the two-hybrid screen, we determined that Gal4(BD)-Ctf7p did not promote expression of any of the three reporter genes (HIS3, ADE2, and lacZ) utilized in the two-hybrid assay (28James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nor did Gal4(BD)-Ctf7p activate reporter gene expression in the presence of a Gal4 activation domain (AD) vector. Yeast matings were used to introduce the GAL4(BD)-CTF7 construct into strains that harbor a genome-wide array of full-length open reading frame sequences fused to GAL4(AD) (29Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3900) Google Scholar). Expressed AD-gene fusions that interact with GAL4(BD)-Ctf7p induce HIS3 expression, promoting growth on the appropriate selection plates. From this genome-wide screen, only two gene products exhibited strong interactions with Ctf7p. At the time that the screen was performed, one of these candidate interacting gene products was listed as an unidentified open reading frame (YJL019W). More recently, YJL019W was characterized as MPS3, a gene that encodes for an essential nuclear envelope spindle pole body assembly component. Defects in MPS3 result in a monopolar spindle phenotype (3Jaspersen S.L. Giddings Jr., T.H. Winey M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Nishikawa S. Terazawa Y. Nakayama T. Hirata A. Makio T. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9938-9943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Investigations into the candidate second interactor are currently under way. Mps3p Associates with Ctf7p under in Vitro Assembly Conditions—It became important to independently test for a physical interaction between Mps3p and Ctf7p. We first employed a GST pull-down strategy to test for a physical association in vitro. One advantage of GST-based purification is that physical interactions are successfully detected even for Ctf7p, which occurs in vivo at very low copy (14Kenna M.A. Skibbens R.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2999-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, GST pull-downs test for proteins that are competent to associate in the absence of in vivo assembly reactions. The entire CTF7 open reading frame was inserted in-frame 3′ to the GST DNA sequence to produce GST-CTF7 (14Kenna M.A. Skibbens R.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2999-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Gst-Ctf7p is readily expressed in bacteria and retains functional activity in vitro (16Skibbens R.V. Genetics. 2004; 166: 32-44Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33Bellows A.M. Kenna M.A. Cassimeris L. Skibbens R.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6334-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We then obtained a yeast strain in which the sole source of Mps3p function is derived from MPS3-13MYC stably integrated into the genome (a generous gift from Drs. S. Jaspersen and M. Winey). Extracts from this stable integrated cell line contained a protein band of the appropriate molecular weight detectable by Western blot. A similar protein band was not detectable in the parental nontransformed strain. To test for protein-protein interactions, GST-Ctf7p or GST alone were bacterially expressed and coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Extracts from yeast cells expressing Mps3-13MYCp were obtained as previously described (14Kenna M.A. Skibbens R.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2999-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The resulting soluble fraction was divided into four aliquots; one aliquot was incubated with Sepharose beads, the second aliquot was incubated with beads coupled to GST, and the third aliquot was incubated with beads coupled to GST-Ctf7p. The fourth aliquot served as a marker to identify Mps3p during Western blot analyses. The three bead matrices were copiously washed before eluting bound proteins off of the bead matrices. Western blot analyses of the eluted proteins reveal that Mps3p specifically associated with GST-Ctf7p, but that Mps3p did not associate with GST or beads alone (Fig. 1). These results provide independent confirmation of the two-hybrid interaction and demonstrate that Mps3p and Ctf7p associate in vitro. We repeated the GST pull-down using MYC-tagged Mps3p in which the C-terminal 60 amino acids are deleted (Mps3Δ60p). Western blot analyses indicate that Mps3Δ60p specifically associates with Ctf7p (data not shown). Mps3p Associates with Ctf7p in Vivo—To test that Mps3p associates with Ctf7p in vivo, we next performed co-immunoprecipitations in which epitope-tagged Ctf7p and Mps3p were co-expressed in yeast cells. To circumvent detection problems associated with low expression levels, we used a Ctf7-HAp construct that expresses Ctf7p at elevated levels. Importantly, this level of Ctf7-HAp expression is fully functional in vivo and provides for normal cell growth in otherwise ctf7Δ cells (9Skibbens R.V. Corson L.B. Koshland D. Hieter P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Cells co-expressing Ctf7-HAp and Mps3Δ60–13MYCp were processed for co-immunoprecipitations as previously described with minor modifications (16Skibbens R.V. Genetics. 2004; 166: 32-44Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by mechanical disruption and centrifuged, and extracted soluble supernatants were incubated with MYC-directed antibodies and Protein A-Sepharose beads. Protein-bead complexes were washed several times prior to Western blot analysis. Anti-MYC staining reveals that Mps3p-13MYCp is efficiently immunoprecipitated under these conditions and that Mps3p immunoprecipitation requires both the MYC tag and MYC-immunoprecipitating antibody (data not shown). We then tested for the ability of Ctf7p-HA to co-immunoprecipitate with Mps3p. Parallel protein membranes containing immunoprecipitated Mps3p were probed using HA-directed antibodies. The results show that Ctf7p indeed co-immunoprecipitates with Mps3p, revealing that Ctf7p associates with Mps3p in vivo (Fig. 2). Importantly, Ctf7p co-immunoprecipitation with Mps3-MYCp depended on the presence of the MYC-precipitating antibody; Ctf7p remained in the supernatant and did not co-immunoprecipitate with Mps3p in the absence of the MYC-precipitating antibody (Fig. 2). In summary, the combined data obtained from two-hybrid, GST pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses reveal that Mps3p associates directly with Ctf7p. Generation of New MPS3 Alleles—Given the physical association of Mps3p and Ctf7p, we hypothesized that Mps3p may function in sister chromatid cohesion. Often, haploid cells harboring defects in spindle pole body components such as MPS3 diploidize to produce cells with 2C and 4C DNA contents (3Jaspersen S.L. Giddings Jr., T.H. Winey M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Nishikawa S. Terazawa Y. Nakayama T. Hirata A. Makio T. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9938-9943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), thereby complicating the quantification of cohesion defects. To circumvent this obstacle, we used a PCR strategy to generate conditional mps3 alleles that exhibit wild type DNA contents (31Kassenbrock C.K. Cao W. Douglas M.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3023-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, mps3Δ cells harboring pRS316-MPS3 were co-transformed with pooled PCR-mutagenized MPS3 products and pRS315-MPS3 with the majority of the MPS3 open reading frame deleted. Of ∼6000 transformants, six scored positive as temperature-sensitive after pRS316-MPS3 counterselection (34Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). The four tightest temperature-sensitive alleles were stably integrated into the genome of mps3Δ cells, providing the only source of Mps3p function in these cells. All four mutant strains (mps3-2, mps3-3, mps3-4, and mps3-5) exhibited temperature sensitivities relative to a wild type control strain (Fig. 3). DNA sequence analyses for each of these new mps3 mutations are summarize"

Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 167-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). It is composed of four components: P-protein (EC 1.4.4.2); H-protein; T-protein (EC 2.1.2.10); and L-protein (EC 2.1.8.1.4). Inherited deficiency of the human mitochondrial GCS causes nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), an inborn error of glycine metabolism (2Tada K. Kure S. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Sakata Y. Owada Y. Sato K. Kojima K. Hisanaga K. Shinka T. Suzuki Y. Aoki Y. Satoh J. Kondo H. Matsubara Y. Kure S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 94: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is characterized by elevated levels of glycine in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. In patients with NKH, convulsive seizures, coma, and respiratory distress develop within a few days after birth (4Toone J.R. Applegarth D.A. Coulter-Mackie M.B. James E.R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A defect in any component of the GCS can abolish the overall activity of the GCS. Up to 15% NKH patients have defects in T-protein, and most other patients have P-protein defects, whereas H-protein and L-protein deficiencies are rare (5Toone J.R. Applegarth D.A. Coulter-Mackie M.B. James E.R. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 17: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). P-protein of the GCS catalyzes the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent decarboxylation of glycine and transfer of the residual methylamine moiety to the lipoyl-lysine arm of the oxidized H-protein, generating a methylamine-loaded H-protein. When methylamine-bound, the lipoamide arm of H-protein is pivoted and is tightly bound into a cleft at the protein surface (6Guilhaudis L. Simorre J.P. Blackledge M. Marion D. Gans P. Neuburger M. Douce R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4259-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). T-protein is a tetrahydrofolate (H4folate)-dependent aminomethyltransferase. It catalyzes transfer of the methylene carbon unit to T-protein-bound H4folate from the methylamine group covalently attached to the lipoamide arm of H-protein, releasing ammonia and producing the reduced H-protein and 5,10-methylene-H4folate. The resulting dihydrolipoyl residue of H-protein is reoxidized by L-protein, thereby completing the reaction cycle (7Motokawa Y. Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Packer L. Cadenas E. Bithiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 389-407Google Scholar). During the course of the GCS catalytic cycle, H-protein commutes successively among P-, T-, and L-proteins with its lipoamide arm visiting all three active sites of other proteins. Small angle x-ray scattering (8Okamura-Ikeda K. Ohmura Y. Fujiwara K Motokawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and cross-linking experiments (9Okamura-Ikeda K. Fujiwara K. Motokawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) indicated that T-protein and H-protein form a stable complex in a 1:1 ratio. NMR spectroscopic studies of the complex between H-protein and T-protein indicated that the interaction surface of H-protein is localized on one side of the cleft where the lipoate arm is positioned (6Guilhaudis L. Simorre J.P. Blackledge M. Marion D. Gans P. Neuburger M. Douce R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4259-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This work also suggested that the role of T-protein is not only to locate H4folate in a position favorable for a nucleophilic attack on the methylene carbon but also to destabilize the methylamine-loaded H-protein to facilitate unlocking of the arm and to initiate the reaction (6Guilhaudis L. Simorre J.P. Blackledge M. Marion D. Gans P. Neuburger M. Douce R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4259-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The lack of the N-terminal 16 residues in Escherichia coli T-protein caused a loss of catalytic activity (10Okamura-Ikeda K. Kameoka N. Fujiwara K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10067-10072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Further N-terminal deletion mutant studies suggested that the N-terminal region of T-protein is essential for the conformational change of T-protein that accompanies its interaction with H-protein (9Okamura-Ikeda K. Fujiwara K. Motokawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Results of limited proteolysis studies on mutants of the E. coli T-protein suggest that the N-terminal region of T-protein functions as a molecular “hasp” to hold T-protein in the compact form required for the proper association with H-protein (11Cohen-Addad C.

In this study, we have determined the first three-dimensional structure of T-protein by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method. Here we report the crystal structure of T-protein from Thermotoga maritima (Tm) in four forms: the apoform; the folinic acid complex; the H4folate complex; and the reduced lipoic acid complex. This study provides essential structural information on cofactor/inhibitor binding and useful insights into H-protein recognition by T-protein. It also provides the structural framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms of how some missense mutations of the human T-protein lead to its inactivation and NKH (2Tada K. Kure S. J.

Protein Expression and Purification—The gcvT gene (TM0211) encoding Tm T-protein was cloned into the expression vector pET-21a(+) (Novagen). The intact protein without any purification tag was overexpressed in E. coli B834(DE3) cells using terrific broth culture medium. Protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galacto-pyranoside, and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 h at 15 °C following growth to mid-log phase at 37 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 200 mm NaCl. Following heat treatment at 80 °C for 10 min, the sample was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 60 min. The supernatant was applied to a HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), which was previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). Upon eluting with a gradient of NaCl in the same buffer, Tm T-protein was eluted at 250–300 mm NaCl concentration. The protein was further purified by gel filtration on a HiLoad XK-16 Superdex 200 prep-grade column (Amersham Biosciences), which was previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 200 mm NaCl. The procedure for preparing the selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein was the same except for the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol in all of the buffers used during the purification steps. When overexpressing the SeMet-substituted protein in E. coli B834(DE3) cells, we used the M9 cell culture medium that contained extra amino acids including SeMet. Crystallization—Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 24 °C by mixing equal volumes (2 μl each) of the protein solution (27 mg ml-1 concentration in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 200 mm NaCl) and the reservoir solution. To grow crystals of the native protein in the apoform, we used a reservoir solution consisting of 15–20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 and 200 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 4.25). The crystals grew to approximate dimensions of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm within a few days. To grow crystals of the native protein complexed with folinic acid, 1.0 m folinic acid solution (dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 200 mm NaCl) was mixed with the protein solution in a 1:20 volume ratio, resulting in an ∼67-fold molar excess of folinic acid over the T-protein monomer. The protein mixed with folinic acid was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C before crystallization. Crystals of the folinic acid complex grew under identical conditions as the apocrystals. The SeMet-substituted protein was crystallized by microseeding techniques under crystallization conditions identical to those for the native crystals except for the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol in the protein solution. The crystals of the SeMet-substituted protein grew up to approximate dimensions of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm within a few days. The crystals of the H4folate complex was obtained by soaking crystals of the SeMet-substituted protein in a H4folate-saturated solution (20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 4.25), and 10 mm dithiothreitol) for 24 h before cryoprotection. To obtain the reduced lipoic acid complex, the crystals of the SeMet-substituted protein were soaked in 50% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide solution containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, which was previously saturated with lipoic acid, for 2 min before cryoprotection. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination—A crystal of the SeMet-substituted protein was frozen using a cryoprotectant solution containing 25% (v/v) glycerol in the crystallization mother liquor. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a Bruker CCD area detector system at the Beamline-6B experimental station of Pohang Light Source. For each image, the crystal was rotated by 1° and the crystal-to-detector distance was set to 360 mm. The raw data were processed and scaled using the program suite HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). The SeMet-substituted crystal belongs to the space group P212121 with unit cell parameters of a = 52.61 Å, b = 54.16 Å, and c = 149.44 Å. Table I summarizes the statistics of MAD data collection.

Data of the reduced lipoic acid-bound crystal were collected at 100 K on a Quantum 315 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corporation, Poway, CA) at the Beamline-5A experimental station of Photon Factory, whereas the data of the apoform were collected at the Beamline-18B experimental station on an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), giving an initial model that accounted for ∼70% of the backbone of the polypeptide chain with much of the sequence assigned. Subsequent manual model building was done using the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The model was refined with the program CNS (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). Several rounds of model building, simulated annealing, positional refinement, and individual B-factor refinement were performed. Subsequently, this model was used to refine structures of the apoform, the folinic acid-bound form, the H4folate-bound form, and the lipoic acid-bound form. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. All of the models have excellent stereochemistry (Table I) as evaluated by the program PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Homology Modeling of Human T-protein—A structural model of the human GCS T-protein (Leu33-Phe394) was built by the homology modeling server (swissmodel.expasy.org/) using the crystal structure of Tm T-protein as template. The N-terminal (Met1-Val32) and C-terminal (Val395-Lys403) regions of the human T-protein were not modeled due to a lack of significant sequence homology. Overall Structure—We have determined the crystal structure of Tm T-protein by the MAD method and refined four structures: (i) the apoform at 1.84 Å; (ii) the complex with (S)-folinic acid (5-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid) at 2.0 Å; (iii) the complex with H4folate at 2.4 Å; and (iv) the complex with reduced lipoic acid at 1.95 Å. The latter three models account for residues 1–362 of one T-protein monomer in an asymmetric unit, whereas Arg362 is additionally missing from the apostructure. The missing residues have no electron density. Tm T-protein is monomeric and is oblate-shaped with approximate dimensions of 55 × 50 × 30 Å (Fig. 1). It is tripartite. Its three domains are positioned in a cloverleaf-like arrangement. Domain 1 (residues 1–51 and 140–240) consists of a predominantly antiparallel, six-stranded β-sheet that contains a single Greek-key motif packed on one side by three α-helices (α1, α5, and α6) and on the other side by two α-helices (α2 and α7). Domain 2 (residues 52–139 and 241–280), which includes a long excursion from domain 1, has a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with flanking α-helices. The two antiparallel β-sheets from domains 1 and 2 are loosely packed against each other. The C-terminal domain 3 (residues 281–362) forms a distorted six-stranded jelly roll that packs perpendicular with the β-sheets of domains 1 and 2. The C-terminal tail (residues 354–362) of domain 3 covers part of domain 1 (Fig. 1, front side) on the opposite side of the N terminus. DALI structural similarity searches (26Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar) with the Tm T-protein apostructure identified two close relatives: the C-terminal H4folate-binding region (residues 421–830) of Arthrobacter globiformis dimethylglycine oxidase (PDB code 1PJ5; a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 1.53 Å for 361 equivalent Cα positions, a Z-score of 47.3, and a sequence identity of 24%) (27Leys D. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4038-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the E. coli Ygfz protein of unknown biological function (PDB code 1NRK) (an r.m.s. deviation of 3.2 Å for 299 equivalent Cα positions, a Z-score of 26.5, and a sequence identity of 14%). Binding Mode of H4folate and Folinic Acid—H4folate-bound and folinic acid-bound structures of Tm T-protein are virtually identical with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.20 Å for 361 Cα atoms (Met1-Arg361). H4folate and folinic acid are bound near the center of Tm T-protein in essentially identical manners (Figs. 1 and 2). Both H4folate and folinic acid adopt a kinked conformation (Fig. 2). The H4folate-bound structure is also nearly identical to the apostructure with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.23 Å for 361 Cα atoms (Met1-Arg361), and the central hole has similar solvent accessible pocket volumes in both the apostructure and the H4folate complex structure. This finding suggests that Tm T-protein has a rigid H4folate binding pocket. The mouth opening of the central hole is more open on the C-terminal side or the glutamate tail side (Fig. 1A, front side) than the N-terminal side or the H-protein interaction side (Fig. 1A, back side). Interactions of T-protein with H-protein and the glutamate tail of H4folate are further discussed below. Side chains of Asp96, Tyr100, Tyr169, Tyr188, Glu195, Arg227, and Arg362 as well as the carbonyl oxygen of Val110 interact directly with H4folate (Fig. 2A). Five of these residues (Asp96, Tyr100, Tyr188, Glu195, and Arg227) are well conserved among bacterial T-proteins (Fig. 3). Tyr83, Tyr168, Tyr236, Leu237, and Tyr239 interact with H4folate indirectly through water molecules or through protein main chain atoms. Two of them (Tyr83 and Tyr239) are well conserved among bacterial T-proteins (Fig. 3). The pterin group of H4folate is largely buried in the central cavity. The side chain Oδ2 atom of Asp96 makes a hydrogen bond with the N10 nitrogen atom of the pterin group (3.05 Å). The pterin N8 atom interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of Val110. Both the hydroxyl oxygen atom of Tyr100 and the Oϵ1 atom of Glu195 contact the NA2 atom of H4folate. The side chain of Arg227 is close to the O4 atom of H4folate. The Nη2 atom makes a direct hydrogen bond (3.31 Å), whereas the Nη1 atom is hydrogen-bonded through a water molecule (4.12 Å). The oxygen atom of Tyr169 is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of the glutamyl group of H4folate (2.98 Å), whereas the side chain of Arg362 makes a salt bridge with the oxygen Oϵ1 atom of the glutamyl group of H4folate (3.11 Å). This mode of H4folate binding to Tm T-protein resembles that of folinic acid binding to the C-terminal region (residues 430–827) of Arthrobacter globiformis dimethylglycine oxidase (27Leys D. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4038-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Some other structural features around H4folate are noteworthy (Fig. 2A). Asn112 and Tyr83 interact with Asp96. Both Asn112 and Tyr83 are highly conserved in bacteria, whereas only Asn112 is conserved in the human T-protein (as Asn145) and Tyr83 is substituted with Leu116 in human. The separation between the Tyr83 Oη1 atom and the Asp96 Oδ2 atom is 2.97 Å, whereas the distance between the Asn112 Nδ2 atom and the Asp96 Oδ1 atom is 2.79 Å. One water molecule is additionally hydrogen-bonded to Asp96 (2.89 and 3.17 Å to the Oδ1 and Oδ2 atoms of Asp96, respectively). In the folinic acid complex, the same residues that contact H4folate interact with folinic acid. Additionally, the oxygen atom of the N5-formyl group of folinic acid interacts with the side chain of Asn112 (Fig. 2B). H4folate lacks a formyl group and thus does not interact with Asn112 (Fig. 2A). The N5-formyl group is also in proximity of the side chain of Tyr188 with its aromatic ring nearly perpendicular to the p-aminobenzoic acid group (Fig. 2B). In the case of the folinic acid complex, we observe an additional binding of the second folinic acid at a narrow cleft on the surface of domain 2 near the interface between domains 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A). The second folinic acid takes an extended conformation, and the residues that interact with the second folinic acid ("
https://openalex.org/W2110725112,"Although sumoylation regulates a diverse and growing number of recognized biological processes, the molecular mechanisms by which the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO can alter the properties of a target protein remain to be established. To address this question, we have used NMR spectroscopy to characterize the complex of mature SUMO-1 with the C-terminal domain of human RanGAP1. Based on amide chemical shift and 15N relaxation measurements, we show that the C terminus of SUMO-1 and the loop containing the consensus sumoylation site in RanGAP1 are both conformationally flexible. Furthermore, the overall structure and backbone dynamics of each protein remain unchanged upon the covalent linkage of Lys524 in RanGAP1 to the C-terminal Gly97 of SUMO-1. Therefore, SUMO-1 and RanGAP1 behave as “beads-on-a-string,” connected by a flexible isopeptide tether. Accordingly, the sumoylation-dependent interaction of RanGAP1 with the nucleoporin RanBP2 may arise through the bipartite recognition of both RanGAP1 and SUMO-1 rather than through a new binding surface induced in either individual protein upon their covalent linkage. We hypothesize that this conformational flexibility may be a general feature contributing to the recognition of ubiquitin-like modified proteins by their downstream effector machineries.

Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar for a recent review). Ubiquitin itself can direct its targets to a number of different fates, including proteasomal degradation and membrane protein transport (2Pickart C. Cell. 2004; 23: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Ubls also control critical cellular functions. For example, NEDD8 activates SCF and related ubiquitin ligases, ISG15/UCRP is induced during in the antiviral interferon response, Apg12p and Apg8p regulate the autophagy pathway, and Hub1p modifies cell polarity factors. The Ubl SUMO regulates a growing number of recognized proteins involved in the cell cycle, DNA repair, the stress response, nuclear transport, transcription, and signal transduction (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Schwartz D.C.

The first protein shown to be post-translationally modified with SUMO is the RanGTPase-activating protein RanGAP1 (7Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 8Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, the cellular localization of RanGAP1 is regulated by sumoylation of its C-terminal domain. During interphase, RanGAP1 is bound to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex via a sumoylation-dependent interaction with the IR domain of the large nucleoporin RanBP2/Nup358 (9Saitoh H. Pu R. Cavenagh M. Dasso M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This localization is required to help create and maintain the spatial gradient of the GTP-bound versus GDP-bound forms of Ran across the nuclear envelope necessary to drive nucleocytoplasmic transport (10Quimby B.B. Dasso M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). During mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down, destroying the Ran-GTP gradient. However, another Ran-GTP gradient is established to help mitotic spindle assembly. Once again, in vertebrates a requisite for the formation of this gradient is the localization of sumoylated RanGAP1 in complex with RanBP2 at the mitotic spindle and with the kinetochores (11Joseph J. Liu S.T. Jablonski S.A. Yen T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). After proteolytic cleavage of nascent SUMO to reveal a C-terminal Gly-Gly motif, sumoylation proceeds with the attachment of the mature protein via its C terminus to a cysteine residue in the SAE2 subunit of the heterodimeric E1 activating enzyme SAE1/SAE2. Formation of the thiolester bond is driven energetically by ATP hydrolysis. This reaction is followed by transesterification of SUMO to Cys93 on UBC9, the E2 conjugating enzyme. Although E3 ligating enzymes, which facilitate sumoylation, have been identified recently, UBC9 is sufficient for transferring SUMO to target proteins such as RanGAP1, at least in vitro (4Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 5Muller S. Ledl A. Schmidt D.

The final product is a covalent isopeptide linkage joining the C-terminal carboxyl of SUMO with the side chain amino group of a lysine in the target protein. There are three paralogs of SUMO present in humans, of which SUMO-2 and SUMO-3, like ubiquitin, can subsequently form polysumoylated chains, whereas SUMO-1 cannot (12Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The residue targeted by SUMO-1 in mouse RanGAP1 is Lys526 (Lys524 in the human ortholog) (13Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), which lies in a ΨKXE/D sumoylation consensus motif (Ψ represents a large branched hydrophobic residue (Ile, Val, or Leu), and X is any amino acid) (14Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 15Sampson D.A. Wang M. Matunis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The crystal structure the C-terminal domain of mouse RanGAP1 in complex with the human SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme, UBC9, revealed the molecular determinants for recognition of this motif (16Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In contrast to a rapidly growing understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms by which Ubls are specifically conjugated to their target proteins (16Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 17VanDemark A.P. Hill C.P. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Schulman B.A. Nature. 2003; 422: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), remarkably little is known about the structural consequences of these post-translational modifications. Studies of di-ubiquitin conjugates revealed interactions between the members of a Lys48-linked pair, but not between those joined at Lys63 (19Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Carson M. Chen Z. Pickart C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16467-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Varadan R. Walker O. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 7055-7063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the MoaD:MoaE molybdopterin synthase complex may also shed light on the consequences of Ubl modification. Although MoaD and MoaE are not naturally linked, in this complex the C-terminal glycine of MoaD, which resembles ubiquitin, is isopeptide-bonded to a lysine in MoaE (22Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The structure also revealed extensive non-covalent interactions between MoaD and MoaE, resulting in conformational changes in the interfacial regions of both proteins (23Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Turque O. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These studies raise the key question as to whether Ubl modification of natural targets also involves significant non-covalent Ubl-target interactions leading to conformational changes in either protein or whether the Ubl is simply covalently linked to the target by a flexible tether (6Johnson E.S. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). For example, it has been hypothesized that sumoylation exposes or creates a new binding surface on RanGAP1 for specific recognition by RanBP2, because neither unmodified SUMO-1 nor RanGAP1 interact with this nucleoporin (13Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). To examine the related concepts regarding the structural and dynamic determinants for the sumoylation of target proteins and the consequences of this post-translational modification, we used NMR spectroscopy to characterize human SUMO-1 and the C-terminal domain of RanGAP1 in their free and covalently linked forms. Based on these studies, we confirm that the target lysine of RanGAP1, as well as the C terminus of mature SUMO-1, lie within mobile regions of the two proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, upon sumoylation, RanGAP1 and SUMO-1 behave as “beads-on-a-string” joined by a flexible isopeptide tether and that their structures and local dynamic features do not change significantly beyond the site of this covalent linkage. These results discount a model of a sumoylation-dependent conformational change in RanGAP1 and/or SUMO-1 to mediate RanBP2 binding. DNA Constructs—Genes encoding residues 1–97 of SUMO-1 (denoted SUMO-1gg), residues 420–587 of RanGAP1 (denoted RanGAP1c), and full-length UBC9 were PCR cloned from a human HeLa cell QUICK-Clone cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories) into the pET28a expression vector (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites. The resulting constructs contained an N-terminal His6 tag with a thrombin cleavage site such that a Gly-Ser-His extension remained after proteolytic processing. The clone of the yeast E1 activating enzyme (AOS1/UBA1) was generated as described (24Bencsath K.P. Podgorski M.S. Pagala V.R. Slaughter C.A. Schulman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47938-47945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—Proteins were expressed using Escherichia coli BL21(λ DE3) cells grown in Luria-Bertani media or in M9 media containing 15NH4Cl and/or 13C6-glucose according to standard protocols (25McIntosh L.P. Dahlquist F.W. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Post-induction cells were collected by centrifugation, re-suspended in nickel column binding buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.5), lysed with a French Press, and sonicated. The cell debris was pelleted, and the resultant supernatant was filtered through a 0.8-μm cellulose acetate membrane (Nalgene) directly onto a nickel-affinity column (HiTrap; Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 125 ml of wash buffer (as binding plus 60 mm imidazole), and proteins were eluted with elution buffer (as binding plus 250 mm imidazole). The eluted fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight into 10 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.5) in preparation for sumoylation reactions or into 100 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA at pH 6.0 or 6.5 for NMR spectroscopy. When necessary to remove the His6 tag, thrombin was included during the dialysis step and subsequently inactivated with p-aminobenzamidine beads (Sigma). Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) was added in a batch method to remove the cleaved His6 tag. The final sample concentrations were determined by UV light absorbance using a predicted ϵ280 of 29,400 m-1 cm-1 for UBC9 and an ϵ278 of 3,840 m-1 cm-1 for SUMO-1gg and RanGAP1c. SDS-PAGE and electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy were used to confirm the mass and purity of each protein. In Vitro Sumoylation and Purification of the RanGAP1c:SUMO-1gg Complex—Sumoylation reactions, monitored by SDS-PAGE, were carried out overnight at 37 °C using 100-ml solutions containing ∼50 μm RanGAP1c, 50 μm SUMO-1gg, 10 μm UBC9, 5 μm AOS1/UBA1, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.5). To prepare the 15N-RanGAP1c:SUMO-1gg complex, the His6 tag was initially cleaved off all the components except SUMO-1gg. For the 15N-SUMO-1gg:RanGAP1c complex, the His6 tag was cleaved off all the components except RanGAP1c. Each reaction mixture was diluted into nickel column binding buffer and purified as described above over a nickel-affinity column. After elution, the pooled product was loaded onto a Fractogel®(SO3−)column (Merck) in 20 mm potassium phosphate and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (pH 5.5) and eluted over a 120-min period with a 0–750 mm NaCl gradient in this buffer to further purify the desired complex. The resulting 15N-RanGAP1c:SUMO-1gg and 15N-SUMO-1gg:RanGAP1c were dialyzed into 100 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA at pH 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. Thrombin was included during dialysis to remove the His6 tag as described above. The final protein complexes were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore) to 0.65 and 0.5 mm, respectively, and D2O was added to ∼10%. Both preparations had an ∼33% yield. SDS-PAGE and electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy were used to confirm the mass of the complexes. A small amount of unmodified RanGAP1c and SUMO-1gg, as well as residual His6-tagged complex, was observed in each preparation. NMR Spectroscopy—Protein samples were in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and ∼10% D2O at pH 6 or 6.5. Spectra for labeled SUMO-1gg were recorded at 17 °C on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer. Spectra for labeled RanGAP1c and UBC9 were recorded at 17 and 30 °C on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer. The reduced temperature was used to limit protein aggregation and/or degradation (26Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 27Jin C. Shiyanova T. Shen Z. Liao X. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2001; 28: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ assignments for 13C/15N-RanGAP1c were obtained through standard triple resonance NMR experiments (28Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Amide 1HN and 15N assignments for 15N-SUMO-1gg, 15N-UBC9, 15N-RanGAP1c:SUMO-1gg, and 15N-SUMO-1gg:RanGAP1c were confirmed using three-dimensional 15N-NOESY and TOCSY-HSQC spectra. Assignments for residues 1–97 of SUMO-1gg (26Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 27Jin C. Shiyanova T. Shen Z. Liao X. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2001; 28: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and UBC9 (29Liu Q. Jin C. Liao X. Shen Z. Chen D.J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16979-16987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were based on those reported previously. NMR-monitored titrations of 15N-RanGAP1c (pH 6.0) were carried out with UBC9 at 30 °C or SUMO-1gg at 17 °C, whereas those of 15N-SUMO-1gg (pH 6.5) with RanGAP1c were recorded at 17 °C, and those of 15N-UBC9 (pH 6.5) with RanGAP1c were recorded at 30 °C. In each case, the experiment began with 500 μlof 400 μm labeled protein to which aliquots of 2 mm unlabeled protein in the same buffer were added in 10 steps to a final molar excess of 4:1. Amide 15N T1 and T2, and heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE relaxation measurements were recorded as described (30Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Foreman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). Spectral processing, resonance assignments, and relaxation analyses were carried out using NMRPipe (31Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11632) Google Scholar), SPARKY 3 (32Goddard T.D. Kneeler D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco1999Google Scholar), and Tensor2 (33Dosset P. Hus J.-C. Blackledge M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The chemical shift assignments of 13C/15N-RanGAP1c, 15N-SUMO-1gg, and 15N-RanGAP1c:SUMO-1gg have been deposited in the BioMagRes Bank (www.bmrb.wisc.edu/) under accession numbers 6305, 6304, and 6305, respectively. The Target Lysine for Sumoylation of RanGAP1c by UBC9 Lies in a Flexible Loop—Resonances from the backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclei in the C-terminal domain of human RanGAP1 were assigned by established NMR methods (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1, available in the on-line version of this article). Based on the measured 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13C′ chemical shifts, the secondary structure of this protein consists of nine α-helixes and matches that found in the crystal structure of the closely related mouse protein (82% identical residues) (16Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The dynamic properties of 15N-RanGAP1c were probed using 15N relaxation experiments, which provide a measure of both the global rotational diffusion of a protein as well as the local mobility of its polypeptide backbone on a residue-specific basis (34Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). From the T1 and T2 lifetimes of amides within the helical core of RanGAP1c, an effective correlation time (τc) of 12.5 ± 0.1 ns was determined for its global tumbling at 17 °C. This value is within the range expected for a monomeric protein of 18.7 kDa at this temperature (35Wagner G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 841-844PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel, insights into the internal mobility of RanGAP1c were obtained from steady-state 1H-15N NOE data. The heteronuclear NOE is a sensitive indicator of dynamics on a sub-nanosecond time scale with values at a 15N frequency of 50.7 MHz ranging from 0.82 for rigid 1H-15N groups to -3.6 for those showing unrestricted mobility (34Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). As documented in Fig. 2A (and in supplemental Table S1 in the on-line version of this article), amides within the ordered helices of the C-terminal domain of 15N-RanGAP1c have an average of 1H-15N NOE of 0.77 ± 0.06, whereas the 12 residues in the disordered region preceding this domain have negative NOE values. More importantly, residues 504–508 and 520–535 between helices H5-H6 and H6-H7, respectively, show reduced 1H-15N NOE values (averages of 0.56 ± 0.09 and 0.61 ± 0.13, respectively) that are indicative of enhanced backbone mobility relative to the remainder of the structured C-terminal domain. The latter of these flexible regions corresponds to a large exposed loop in the crystal structure of mouse RanGAP1c and contains the consensus sumoylation motif Leu-Lys524-Ser-Glu (16Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The amide 1H-15N NOE value of Lys524 within this loop is 0.60 ± 0.09. To confirm that the consensus motif in the flexible H6-H7 loop of human RanGAP1c is the target of UBC9-mediated sumoylation and to verify that a known intermolecular interface for RanGAP1c can be detected by NMR methods, the interaction between these two proteins in solution was investigated. Specifically, 1H-15N HSQC spectra of either 15N-labeled RanGAP1c or UBC9 were recorded upon titration with the unlabeled partner (supplemental Fig. S2, available in the on-line version of this article). The chemical shifts and relaxation properties of a 1H-15N group are highly sensitive to its local environment, and, thus, selective perturbations in the HSQC spectrum of a protein provide a means to identify even subtle conformational changes such as those occurring at interaction surfaces. Upon titration, residues in 15N-RanGAP1c clustering near helix H6 and the loops between H6-H7 (including Lys524) and H8-H9 showed selective loss of intensity. A similar behavior was observed for residues in 15N-UBC9 near helix H3, strands S6 and S7, and the catalytic Cys93. These regions correspond very well with the intermolecular interface observed in the crystal complex of mouse RanGAP1c and human UBC9 in which the target lysine from this consensus motif is bound in close proximity to the active site cysteine of the E2 conjugating enzyme (16Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Furthermore, based on the NMR titration data, including the observation of selective conformational exchange broadening, we estimate a dissociation constant (Kd) <10 μm for this protein complex. This Kd value is consistent with that of 0.5 μm determined for human UBC9 and RanGAP1c by isothermal titration calorimetry (36Tatham M.H. Kim S. Yu B. Jaffray E. Song J. Zheng J. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Chen Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9959-9969Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, NMR methods accurately detect a previously characterized protein-protein interaction involving RanGAP1c. Parenthetically, this Kd is markedly lower than those in the millimolar range reported for peptide models of sumoylation sites from p53 and c-Jun (37Lin D. Tatham M.H. Yu B. Kim S. Hay R.T. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21740-21748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and supports the hypothesis that RanGAP1c is an efficient substrate for UBC9 because of the significant interaction surfaces between these two proteins. The C Terminus of SUMO-1gg Is Conformationally Dynamic— The assigned 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the biologically active form of human SUMO-1 (residues 1–97) is presented in Fig. 1B. Consistent with structural and relaxation studies reported for the nascent protein (26Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 27Jin C. Shiyanova T. Shen Z. Liao X. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2001; 28: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), residues 1–20 and 94–97 at both termini of mature SUMO-1gg are conformationally mobile on the sub-nanosecond time scale as evidenced by reduced 1H-15N NOE values (Fig. 2C). In addition, based on the 15N T1 and T2 relaxation of amides within the structured core of the protein, the effective τc for the global tumbling of SUMO-1gg (11.4 kDa) at 17 °C is 8.6 ± 0.1 ns. RanGAP1c and SUMO-1gg Do Not Interact Non-covalently— To examine if RanGAP1c and SUMO-1gg associate in solution, reciprocal NMR-monitored titrations of one unlabeled and one 15N-labeled protein were performed. In both cases, the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the labeled protein showed no selective intensity or chemical shift perturbations upon titration with a 4-fold molar excess of unlabeled partner (final concentration ratios, 220 to 890 μm; data not shown). Thus, unlike the case of UBC9, free RanGAP1c and SUMO-1gg do not appreciably interact in a non-covalent manner. The Structure and Dynamics of RanGAP1c Are Unperturbed upon Sumoylation—Milligram quantities of isopeptide-linked RanGAP1c:SUMO-1gg were prepared using a large scale in vitro sumoylation reaction. The reaction was carried out with only one of RanGAP1c or SUMO-1gg15N-labeled to allow the selective detection of signals from that protein within the covalent complex. Although an expression system for generating SUMO-1 modified proteins in E. coli has been developed (38Uchimura Y. Nakao M. Saitoh H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), such selective isotopic labeling would not be possible using this approach. To facilitate purification of the complex by nickel-affinity chromatography, while minimizing any potential background signal from the unmodified 15N-protein, only the unlabeled protein in the reaction mixture carried a His6 tag. The tag was removed proteolytically after isolation of the complex. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-RanGAP1c:SUMO-1gg overlaps closely with that of free 15N-RanGAP1c (Fig. 1A). Given the exquisite sensitivity of amide chemical shifts to local environment, this finding clearly indicates that the overall structure of RanGAP1c is not significantly perturbed upon covalent modification, nor does a specific interaction occur with SUMO-1gg. However, detailed inspection of the HSQC spectrum of the complex reveals that signals from residues 519–534 are relatively weakened, suggestive of localized millisecond time scale conformational exchange broadening due to the tethering of SUMO-1gg to this loop region. In addition, a strong new peak at 7.85 and 121.0 ppm in 1H and 15N, respectively, is observed in the spectrum of 15N-RanGAP1c:SUMO-1gg. This signal was assigned to the isopeptide amide group based on interprotein 1H-1H NOE interactions involving the 1Hζ of Lys524 in RanGAP1c and the 1Hα and 1HN of Gly97 in SUMO-1gg (Fig. 3). Paralleling the lack of structural perturbations, 1H-15N NOE measurements reveal that the fast internal dynamics of the backbone of RanGAP1c are not significantly changed upon sumoylation (Fig. 2B). In particular, the H6-H7 loop region containing Lys524 continues to exhibit reduced NOE values indicative of local conformational mobility (0.72 ± 0.23 for Lys524 and an average of 0.59 ± 0.16 for residues 520–535). Moreover, the isopeptide 15Nζ has a heteronuclear NOE value of 0.23 ± 0.06, demonstrating that the linkage is also very flexible on a sub-nanosecond time scale. Finally, as expected because of an increase in mass, 15N T1 and T2 relaxation experiments yielded a slower effective global τc of 18.1 ± 0.2 ns at 17 °C for the tumbling of RanGAP1c within the sumoylated 30.1 kDa complex. The Structure and Dynamics of SUMO-1gg Are Unperturbed upon Attachment to RanGAP1c—Complementary to the previous experiments, the properties of 15N-SUMO-1gg:RanGAP1c were compared with those of 15N-SUMO-1gg. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of this protein within the sumoylated complex overlaps very well with that of the unmodified state (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that the structure of SUMO-1gg is also not perturbed upon covalent linkage to RanGAP1. Chemical shift changes are only observed for Gly96 and Gly97, as is expected for the conversion of the charged"
https://openalex.org/W1967921270,"Structural analyses of several bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters indicate that an aromatic amino acid residue in a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) interacts with the adenine ring of the bound ATP and contributes to the ATP binding. Substitution of this aromatic residue with a polar serine residue in bacterial histidine transporter completely abolished both ATP binding and ATP-dependent histidine transport. However, substitution of the aromatic amino acid residue in the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator with a polar cysteine residue did not have any effect on the ATP-dependent chloride channel function of the protein. To determine whether the other eucaryotic ABC transporters use the strategy analogous to that in some bacterial ABC transporters, the aromatic Trp653 residue in NBD1 and the Tyr1302 residue in NBD2 of human multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) was mutated to either a different aromatic residue or a polar cysteine residue. Substitution of the aromatic residue with a different aromatic amino acid, such as W653Y or Y1302W, did not affect ATP-dependent leukotriene C4 (LTC4) transport. In contrast, substitution of the aromatic residue with a polar cysteine residue, such as W653C or Y1302C, decreased the affinity for ATP, resulting in greatly increased Kd values for ATP binding or Km values for ATP in ATP-dependent LTC4 transport. Interestingly, although substitution of the aromatic Trp653 in NBD1 of MRP1 with a polar cysteine residue greatly decreases the affinity for ATP, the ATP-dependent LTC4 transport activities are much higher than that of wild-type MRP1, supporting our hypothesis that the increased release rate of the bound ATP from the mutated NBD1 facilitates the protein to start a new cycle of ATP-dependent solute transport.

Because of the decreased concentration of anti-cancer drugs inside of the cells overexpressing these proteins, the cells become multidrug-resistant. The most conserved features of these proteins are the two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) containing Walker A and B motifs (7Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J.

Because eucaryotic ABC transporters, such as P-glycoprotein, MRP1, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), also contain Walker A and B motifs, ABC signature motif, and an aromatic amino acid residue; therefore, the way they bind ATP should be analogous to those procaryotic ABC transporters.

Additional evidence comes from the naturally occurring CFTR mutant G551D, a mutation of the Gly551 residue in the ABC signature motif of NBD1 causing cystic fibrosis (21Shrimpton A.E. McIntosh I.

Presumably the mutation of this critical Gly residue in the LSGGQ ABC signature motif to an acidic amino acid affects ATP binding and the chloride channel function of the protein (24Wilkinson D.J. Mansoura M.K. Watson P.Y. Smit L.S. Collins F.S. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The corresponding mutations in MRP1, G771D in NBD1 and G1433D in NBD2, almost completely abolished ATP-dependent LTC4 transport (20Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Haraguchi M. Sumizawa T. Aoki S. Kobayashi M. Akiyama S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, substitution of the aromatic amino acid with a polar cysteine residue in human CFTR did not disrupt the chloride channel function (25Berger A.L. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These authors suggested that ATP binding in CFTR may not involve the coordination of the adenine base with an aromatic amino acid residue analogous to that in some bacterial ABC transporters (25Berger A.L.

However, the close interactions between Trp653 in NBD1 of human MRP1 and the adenine ring of the bound ATP were identified by the two-dimensional NMR spectra (28Ramaen O. Masscheleyn S. Duffieux F.

To test whether this aromatic residue is involved in ATP binding to the NBD1 of human MRP1, Trp653 was mutated to either Tyr or Cys. In the meantime, the corresponding aromatic residue in NBD2, Tyr1302, was mutated to either Trp or Cys. The substitution of Trp653 or Tyr1302 with a different aromatic amino acid, such as W653Y or Y1302W, has little effect on the Km values for ATP in ATP-dependent LTC4 transport. In contrast, the substitution of Trp653 or Tyr1302 with a polar cysteine residue greatly increased the Kd values for ATP binding and the Km values for ATP in ATP-dependent LTC4 transport, implying that these aromatic residues in NBD1 and NBD2 of MRP1 do play an important role in nucleotide binding.

The tryptophan residue at position 653 was mutated to either tyrosine or cysteine (see Fig. 1A, W653Y or W653C) by using the forward/reverse primers and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (19Hou Y.

The underlined sequences are codons for mutated residues. Y1302W and Y1302C mutations were generated by using the same strategy as for W653Y. The forward and reverse primers for Y1302W and Y1302C are: Y1302W/forward, 5′-CGG AAC TAC TGC CTG CGC TGG CGA GAG GAC CTG GAC TTC-3′; Y1302W/reverse, 5′-GAA GTC CAG GTC CTC TCG CCA GCG CAG GCA GTA GTT CCG-3′; Y1302C/forward, 5′-CGG AAC TAC TGC CTG CGC TGC CGA GAG GAC CTG GAC TTC-3′; and Y1302C/reverse, 5′-GAA GTC CAG GTC CTC TCG GCA GCG CAG GCA GTA GTT CCG-3′. The N-half and C-half containing these mutations were sequenced completely and used to make other combinations (see Fig. 1A). To make these combinations, a KpnI-RsrII fragment containing C-half, for example, with a Y1302W mutation, was cloned into a KpnI-RsrII fragment containing pDual vector DNA and N-half, for example, with a W653Y mutation, to generate W653Y/Y1302W. The regions containing these mutations were sequenced again to confirm that the correct clones were obtained. Recombinant Viral DNA Preparation and Viral Particle Production—Generation of recombinant viral DNA was performed according to Invitrogen's recommendation. PDual/MRP1 donor plasmid DNA was transformed into DH10Bac-competent cells harboring the parent Bacmid DNA with a mini-attTn7 target site and the helper plasmid. Bacteria transformed with the donor plasmid DNA were selected on LB plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 7 μg/ml gentamicin, and 10 μg/ml tetracyclin. In addition, colonies containing recombinant Bacmids were identified by disruption of the lacZα gene (white colonies) on the LB plates containing 100 μg/ml X-gal and 40 μg/ml isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside. A single colony confirmed as having a white phenotype on the LB plate with X-gal and isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside was inoculated in medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 7 μg/ml gentamicin, and 10 μg/ml tetracyclin. The purified recombinant Bacmids were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with MRP1-specific primers and then used to transfect Sf21 cells with CellFECTIN reagent (Invitrogen). After 3–4 days of incubation at 27 °C, the supernatants containing viral particles were collected, and the cell lysates (with 2% SDS) were used to do a Western blot, probed with MRP1-specific monoclonal antibodies 42.4 and 897.2 (19Hou Y.

Viral Plaque Assay, Viral Infection, and Membrane Vesicle Preparation—Viral plaque assay was performed according to Invitrogen's recommendation. The expression levels of the dually expressed N-halves and C-halves with varying multiplicity of infection were determined by Western blot. The multiplicities of infection producing similar amounts of N-halves (comparing the wild-type N-half with mutated N-halves) and C-halves (comparing wild-type C-half with mutated C-halves) were used to infect Sf21 cells for membrane vesicle preparations. MRP1-containing membrane vesicles were prepared according to the procedure described previously (19Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol.

Chemiluminescent film detection was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pierce). Photoaffinity Labeling of MRP1 Protein—Photoaffinity labeling experiments were carried out in a 10 μl of solution containing 5 μg of membrane vesicles, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm ouabain, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and varying concentrations of [α-32P]8-N3ATP for 5 min on ice.

This nitrocellulose membrane was then washed with 10 ml of ice-cold 1× transport buffer, air-dried, and placed in a 10 ml of biodegradable counting scintillant (Amersham Biosciences). The radioactivity bound to the nitrocellulose membrane was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman LS 6000SC).Fig. 3ATP-dependent LTC4 transport by membrane vesicles containing wild-type and mutant MRP1 proteins. LTC4 transport experiments were performed in a 30-μl solution containing 400 nm LTC4 (12.64 nCi of 3H-labeled LTC4) and varying concentrations of ATP as indicated in the figures at 37 °C for 1 min. The radioactivity bound to the nitrocellulose membranes (3H-labeled LTC4 transported into membrane vesicles) was determined by liquid scintillation counting.

To test whether these aromatic amino acid residues are involved in ATP binding, these aromatic residues were mutated to either another aromatic residue, such as Trp or Tyr, or a polar residue, such as Cys, as shown in Fig. 1A. The recombinant viruses expressing wild-type or mutated N-halves (1–932) and C-halves (933–1531) were prepared and expressed in Sf21 cells.2Fig. 1B shows the Western blot results of the proteins expressed in Sf21 cells, probed with antibody 42.4 against NBD1 and 897.2 against NBD2 of MRP1 (19Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). 42.4 antibody detected a 93-kDa N-half band, whereas 897.2 antibody detected 57- and 52-kDa C-half bands (Fig. 1B). We have found that the 57-kDa band is the glycosylated C-half, whereas the 52-kDa band is the unglycosylated C-half.2Fig. 1B also shows the relative expression levels of the MRP1 proteins in the membrane vesicles. Overall the amounts of N- and C-halves in these membrane vesicles are similar (Fig. 1B), indicating that mutations of the aromatic residues in NBD1 and/or NBD2 did not significantly affect the protein processing. The Substitutions of the Aromatic Residues with a Polar Amino Acid in NBD1 and NBD2 Decreased LTC4 Transport Activities at Low ATP Concentration—If these aromatic residues are involved in ATP binding by providing van der Waals' interactions with the adenine ring of the bound nucleotide, then mutation of these aromatic residues to a moderately polar residue should reduce the binding force and decrease the affinity for ATP. To test this possibility, membrane vesicles containing wild-type and mutated MRP1s (Fig. 1B) were utilized to do ATP-dependent LTC4 transport in the presence of 50 μm ATP, which is within the range of the Km values for ATP (Km (ATP)) of wild-type N-half + wild-type C-half mediated LTC4 transport (34Gao M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27782-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).2Fig. 2 shows that the transport activity of W653Y-mutated N-half + wild-type C-half is ∼2-fold of wild type, whereas the transport activity of wild-type N-half + Y1302W-mutated C-half or W653Y-mutated N-half + Y1302W-mutated C-half is similar to that of wild type, indicating that substitution of an aromatic residue with a different aromatic amino acid, such as Trp to Tyr or Tyr to Trp, does not have a significant negative effect on the ATP binding and hydrolysis. In contrast, the substitution of the aromatic residue, no matter whether it is in NBD1 or NBD2, with a nucleophilic cysteine residue, such as W653C-mutated N-half + wild-type C-half, W653C-mutated N-half + Y1302W-mutated C-half, wild-type N-half + Y1302C-mutated C-half, W653Y-mutated N-half + Y1302C-mutated C-half, or W653C-mutated N-half + Y1302C-mutated C-half, greatly decreased the ATP-dependent LTC4 transport activities (Fig. 2), implying that both aromatic residues, Trp653 in NBD1 and Tyr1302 in NBD2, are involved in ATP binding. The Substitutions of the Aromatic Residues with a Polar Amino Acid in NBD1 and/or NBD2 Increased Km Values for ATP in ATP-dependent LTC4 Transport—If the two aromatic residues, Trp653 and Tyr1302, are involved in ATP binding, then mutation of one or both of these residues to a polar amino acid should decrease the hydrophobic interaction force between the aromatic residue and the adenine ring of the bound ATP, i.e. the affinity for ATP, and affect Km (ATP) values in ATP-dependent LTC4 transport. To test this possibility, membrane vesicles containing wild-type and mutated MRP1s (Fig. 1B) were utilized to do ATP-dependent LTC4 transport in the presence of varying concentrations of ATP. Panels A and B of Fig. 3 show that the transport activities of those N-halves and C-halves containing an aromatic residue reach plateau within low concentrations of ATP, implying low Km (ATP) values. The transport activity of W653Y-mutated N-half + wild-type C-half is much higher than that of wild type, whereas the activities of wild-type N-half + Y1302W-mutated C-half and W653Y-mutated N-half + Y1302W-mutated C-half are similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 3A), which are consistent with the results in Fig. 2. Table I shows their Km (ATP) and Vmax for LTC4 (Vmax (LTC4)) values in ATP-dependent LTC4 transport. Substitution of the aromatic Trp653 with a different aromatic amino acid (Tyr), i.e. W653Y, slightly decreased the Km (ATP) value but increased Vmax (LTC4) value 2-fold (Table I). Substitution of the aromatic residue Tyr1302 in NBD2 with a different aromatic Trp residue, Y1302W, also slightly decreased Km (ATP) value; however, the Vmax (LTC4) value was not changed (Table I). Interestingly, the switch of those two aromatic residues in NBD1 and NBD2, W653Y-mutated N-half + Y1302W-mutated C-half, did not alter the Km (ATP) value but slightly increased the Vmax (LTC4) value (Table I). Panels C and D of Fig. 3 show that the transport activities of those N-half mutants containing a substitution with a polar cysteine residue reach plateau within high concentrations of ATP, implying high Km (ATP) values. Table I shows that the Km (ATP) values for W653C, W653C/Y1302W, and W653C/Y1302C are 4.5-, 4.2-, and 22.8-fold higher than that of wild-type MRP1. Interestingly, the transport activities of these N-half mutants are also higher than that of wild-type MRP1 (Table I). The transport activities of those C-half mutants containing a substitution with a polar cysteine residue also reach plateau within high concentrations of ATP (Fig. 3, E and F). Their Km (ATP) values are even higher than those N-half mutants containing only one cysteine replacement, such as W653C and W653C/Y1302W (Table I). However, their Vmax (LTC4) values are less than those of the N-half mutants containing only one cysteine replacement, such as W653C and W653C/Y1302W (Table I).Table IThe mean Km (μm ATP) and Vmax (pmol of LTC4/mg of protein/min) of wild-type and mutant MRP1sProteinAmino acid at positionKmaThe Km (n = 3) and Vmax (n = 3) values were derived from Fig. 3.VmaxaThe Km (n = 3) and Vmax (n = 3) values were derived from Fig. 3.653 (NBD1)1302 (NBD2)μm ATPpmol·mg-1·min-1Wild-type MRP1TrpTyr69.0 ± 5.2389.0 ± 32.9W653YTyrTyr46.5 ± 0.7820.0 ± 21.2Y1302WTrpTrp47.7 ± 2.1386.7 ± 60.3W653Y/Y1302WTyrTrp65.5 ± 0.7499.0 ± 5.66W653CCysTyr311.7 ± 46.5881.7 ± 78.5W653C/Y1302WCysTrp290.0 ± 10.01353.3 ± 203.4Y1302CTrpCys340.0 ± 42.4700.0 ± 70.7W653Y/Y1302CTyrCys395.0 ± 15.0380.3 ± 66.9W653C/Y1302CCysCys1573.3 ± 25.2782.7 ± 20.5a The Km (n = 3) and Vmax (n = 3) values were derived from Fig. 3. Open table in a new tab Substitution of an Aromatic Residue with a Polar Amino Acid in NBD1 or NBD2 Increases its Kd Value for ATP Binding— The greatly increased Km (ATP) values of those mutants containing a polar residue imply that the substitution of the aromatic residue with a nucleophilic cysteine residue decreases the affinity for ATP. However, because the Km (ATP) value reflects the total events of ATP binding/hydrolysis at both NBD1 and NBD2 and the ATP-dependent LTC4 transport, it might be difficult to make that conclusion based solely on the Km (ATP) values. To test whether these substitutions really alter their affinities for ATP, membrane vesicles containing wild-type N-half (Trp653) + wild-type C-half (Tyr1302), W653C-mutated N-half + Y1302W-mutated C-half, W653Y-mutated N-half + Y1302C-mutated C-half, and W653C-mutated N-half + Y1302C-mutated C-half were labeled with [α-32P]8-N3ATP on ice to determine their Kd values (Fig. 4). Because the labeling reactions were performed on ice, ATP hydrolysis reaction should be greatly reduced, and the labeling level should mainly reflect the equilibrium of forward and backward reactions: ATP+NBD⇌k−1k1ATP·NBD REACTION 1where the velocity of forward reaction Vf = k1[ATP][NBD], and the velocity of the backward reaction (or releasing) Vb = k–1[ATP·NBD]. At the equilibrium, Vf = Vb; therefore, k1[ATP][NBD] = k–1[ATP·NBD] and Kd = k–1/k1 = [ATP][NBD]/[ATP·NBD]. A higher Kd value for a mutated NBD indicates a decreased affinity for ATP of that specifically mutated NBD. Panels A, D, G, and J of Fig. 4 show the autoradiograms reflecting [α-32P]8-N3ATP labeling of the wild-type and mutated N- and C-halves on ice. Labeling was determined by Packard Instant Imager and plotted out against [α-32P]8-N3ATP concentrations (Fig. 4, B, C, E, F, H, I, K, and L). The Kd for wild-type NBD1 co-expressed with wild-type NBD2 is ∼9 μm ATP, whereas the Kd for wild-type NBD2 co-expressed with wild-type NBD1 is ∼33 μm ATP (Table II), which are similar to the Kd values of NBD1 and NBD2 determined from the full-length MRP1 protein (35Yang R. Cui L. Hou Y.-X. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30764-30771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Kd value for W653C-mutated NBD1, co-expressed with Y1302W-mutated NBD2, could not be determined because of very weak labeling of this mutated fragment (Fig. 4D), presumably with a very high Kd value. Interestingly, the Kd value for Y1302W-mutated NBD2, co-expressed with W653C-mutated NBD1, increased from 33 (the Kd of wild-type NBD2) to 139 μm ATP (Table II), presumably because of the negative effect of W653C-mutated NBD1 on the Y1302W-mutated NBD2. Therefore there might be an allosteric interaction between the two NBDs even though the experiments were performed on ice. The very weak labeling of W653C-mutated NBD1, including the labeling of W653C-mutated NBD1 co-expressed with Y1302W-mutated (Fig. 4D) and Y1302C-mutated (Fig. 4J) NBD2, indicates that substitution of the aromatic residue with a polar amino acid greatly decreases the affinity for ATP at this mutated NBD1. The Kd value of W653Y-mutated NBD1, co-expressed with Y1302C-mutated NBD2, increased from 9 (the Kd of wild-type NBD1) to 29 (Table II), presumably because of the negative effect of Y1302C-mutated NBD2. The Kd values of the Y1302C-mutated NBD2 (Table II) increased from 33 (the Kd of wild-type NBD2) to 122 (the Kd of Y1302C-mutated NBD2 co-expressed with W653Y-mutated NBD1) and 160 μm ATP (the Kd of Y1302C-mutated NBD2 co-expressed with W653C-mutated NBD1), indicating that substitution of this aromatic residue with a polar amino acid also decreased the affinity for ATP at the mutated NBD2. The combinations of the decreased affinities for ATP at the W653C-mutated NBD1 and Y1302C-mutated NBD2 lead to a very high Km (ATP) value (1573 μm ATP in Table I) of the double mutated MRP1 in ATP-dependent LTC4 transport.Table IIThe mean Kd (μm ATP) of wild-type and mutant MRP1sProteinAmino acid at positionKd at NBD1aThe Kd values (n = 3) were derived from Fig. 4.Kd at NBD2aThe Kd values (n = 3) were derived from Fig. 4.653 (NBD1)1302 (NBD2)μm ATPμm ATPWild-type MRP1TrpTyr8.7 ± 1.532.7 ± 3.5W653C/Y1302WCysTrpNDbNot determined because of the very weak labeling of this fragment.139.3 ± 11.0W653Y/Y1302CTyrCys28.7 ± 1.5121.7 ± 7.6W653C/Y1302CCysCysND159.7 ± 31.2a The Kd values (n = 3) were derived from Fig. 4.b Not determined because of the very weak labeling of this fragment. Open table in a new tab As discussed in the Introduction, the objective of the project described here is to determine whether the aromatic Trp653 residue in NBD1 and/or Tyr1302 in NBD2 of human MRP1 protein are/is involved in nucleotide binding. The approach utilized is to replace the aromatic residues at those two positions with either a different aromatic residue or a moderately polar amino acid. Fig. 1B shows that all of these mutants, no matter whether they were mutated to a different aromatic residue or a polar cysteine residue, produced similar amounts of MRP1 protein as wild type, implying that the substitution with a moderately polar amino acid does not have a significant effect on protein processing and stability. Figs. 2 and 3 show that all of these mutants have the ability to transport LTC4, indicating that these mutations, including the one with a polar residue replacement, do not induce a significant global conformational change and have the ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP. The above conclusions make it possible to determine whether these aromatic residues in NBD1 and NBD2 are involved in ATP binding. Substitution of the aromatic residue with a different aromatic amino acid do not have a significant negative effect on their ATP-dependent LTC4 transport (Figs. 2 and 3). Their Michaelis constant Km (ATP) values in ATP-dependent LTC4 transport are similar to that of wild type (Table I), implying that these substitutions with a different aromatic amino acid do not significantly change their affinities for ATP. In contrast, the substitutions of the aromatic residues with a polar cysteine residue greatly increased their Michaelis constant Km (ATP) values (Table I), implying that these mutations do affect their ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP, probably because of decreased affinity for ATP. Consistent with this conclusion, substitution of the aromatic Trp653 in NBD1 and Tyr1302 in NBD2 with a polar cysteine residue greatly increased their Kd (ATP) values (Table II), indicating that the substitution of the aromatic residues with a polar cysteine residue greatly decreased affinity for ATP in the mutated NBD1 and NBD2. These results clearly indicate that the aromatic Trp653 residue is involved in ATP binding in NBD1, and the Tyr1302 residue is involved in ATP binding in NBD2. However, mutation of either one or both did not abolish the ATP-dependent LTC4 transport, which is in contrast with the Y16S mutation in bacterial ABC transporter HisP that abolished both ATP binding and ATP-dependent histidine transport (26Shyamala V. Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the interactions between the aromatic residue and the adenine ring of the bound ATP in MRP1 may not be as critical as in bacterial ABC transporter HisP. These results also imply that the stereo orientation of the aromatic residue in MRP1 may be different from that in bacterial ABC transporter HisP (8Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In addition, these results are also in contrast with the mutation in human CFTR (25Berger A.L. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29407-29412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), implying that the stereo orientation of the aromatic residue in human MRP1 may also be different from that in human (25Berger A.L. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29407-29412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or mouse CFTR (27Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K. Dickey M. Dorwart M. Fowler R. Gao X. Guggino W.B. Hendrickson W.A. Hunt J.F. Kearins M.C. Lorimer D. Maloney P.C. Post K.W. Rajashankar K.R. Rutter M.E. Sauder J.M. Shriver S. Thibodeau P.H. Thomas P.J. Zhang M. Zhao X. Emtage S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Interestingly, substitution of the aromatic residue Trp653 with a polar cysteine residue, such as W653C, W653C/Y1302W, and W653C/Y1302C, greatly decreased their affinity for ATP but did not abolish ATP binding completely and lead to very high Km (ATP) and Vmax (LTC4) values in ATP-dependent LTC4 transport (Table I). We have found that release of bound ATP, no matter whether it is hydrolyzed or not, from the NBD1 of MRP1 facilitates the protein to start a new cycle of ATP-dependent solute transport.2 The increased Vmax values of the W653C-mutated NBD1s, including W653C, W653C/Y1302W, and W653C/Y1302C, can also be explained by this hypothesis. The rationales are: 1) although the binding of ATP to the W653C-mutated NBD1 requires higher nucleotide concentration than that of the wild type because of lower affinity of W653C-mutated NBD1 for that nucleotide, ATP still can easily bind to the W653C-mutated NBD1 because of the ATP concentration in mm range; 2) the much higher Kd value of the W653C-mutated NBD1 also indicates that the release rate of the bound ATP from the W653C-mutated NBD1 is much higher than that of wild type; and 3) release of the bound ATP from the W653C-mutated NBD1 resets the MRP1 protein back to its original conformational state so that the molecule can start a new cycle of ATP-dependent solute transport, leading to a higher Vmax (LTC4) value than that of wild-type MRP1. The substitution of the aromatic residue Tyr1302 in NBD2 with a polar cysteine residue also decreased its affinity for ATP, resulting in increased Km (ATP) values in ATP-dependent LTC4 transport (Table I) and Kd values in ATP binding (Table II). Whether this decreased affinity for nucleotide in NBD2 also facilitates the molecule to start a new cycle of ATP-dependent solute transport is not clear, because the Y1302C-mutated NBD2 co-expressed with wild-type NBD1 increased its Vmax (LTC4) 1.8-fold (Table I), whereas the Y1302C-mutated NBD2 co-expressed with W653Y-mutated NBD1 did not have a significant effect on its Vmax (LTC4) value (Table I). In summary, these results clearly indicate that the release of the bound nucleotide from NBD1 plays an important role during ATP-dependent solute transport.

https://openalex.org/W2059442882,"Recently we reported that simultaneous treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with the combination of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) resulted in synergistic activation of Raf-1 kinase (Lee, M., Petrovics, G., and Anderson, W. B. (2003) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 311, 1026–1033). In this study we have demonstrated that PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), a potent and selective inhibitor of the Src-family tyrosine kinase, greatly potentiated the ability of PMA and/or H2O2 to activate Raf-1 kinase, whereas it blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1. Unlike PMA/H2O2 treatment, which showed transient activation, PP2-mediated Raf-1 activation was sustained and continued to increase through 4 h of treatment. Transient transfection studies with a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (N19Ras) indicated that this PP2-induced activation of Raf-1 was Ras-independent. Moreover, PP2 showed no effect on platelet-derived growth factor-induced Raf-1 activation. Interestingly, mutation of the reported Raf-1 Src family tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site by conversion of tyrosines 340 and 341 to phenylalanine (YY340/341FF Raf) had limited effect on the ability of PP2 to induce significant stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity. Taken together, our results suggest that a tyrosine phosphorylation event is involved in the negative feedback regulation of Raf-1. Inhibition of a Src family tyrosine kinase by PP2 appears to alleviate this tyrosine kinase-mediated inhibition of Raf-1 and allow activating modification(s) of Raf-1 to proceed. This PP2 effect resulted in significant and sustained Ras-independent activation of Raf-1 by PMA and H2O2.

This PP2 effect resulted in significant and sustained Ras-independent activation of Raf-1 by PMA and H2O2. Raf-1 is a cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase that plays an important role in the transmission of signals initiated at the plasma membrane to modulate transcriptional activation and mitogenesis (1Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 2Hagemann C. Rapp U.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Raf-1 activation is mediated by an interaction with Ras-GTP, which recruits Raf-1 to the plasma membrane and induces a conformation change that relieves an inhibition imposed by the N terminus on the catalytic domain (3Marshall M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is, however, insufficient to activate Raf-1, and additional phosphorylations on tyrosine and serine/threonine residues are required for activation (4Cai H. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann-Tappe I.

The PKC family is composed of at least 11 closely related isozymes that are classified into three major groups. The conventional PKCs (PKCα, -β1, -β2, and -γ) are Ca2+-dependent and are regulated by diacylglycerol and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The novel PKCs (PKCδ, -ϵ, -ι, and -θ) are Ca2+-independent but exhibit similar response to diacylglycerol and PMA. In contrast, the atypical aPKCs (PKCζ and -λ) are insensitive to Ca2+, diacylglycerol, and PMA (13Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Both conventional PKCα and novel PKCϵ have been shown to activate Raf-1 in vitro (4Cai H. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann-Tappe I.

The oxygen radicals generated appear to act as second messengers to regulate transmembrane signaling and to modulate cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. A number of cell types produce H2O2 in response to a variety of growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (23Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

Moreover, we found that a 33-kDa C-terminal, kinase-inactive fragment of Raf-1 underwent a mobility shift in response to stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells with H2O2 (32Ferrier A.F. Lee M. Anderson W.B.

In related studies, treatment of cells with ionizing radiation was found to increase the level of membrane-bound, tyrosine-phosphorylated Raf-1 and stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity (29Abe M.K.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In particular, phosphorylation of serine 338 and tyrosine 341 are required for Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1 (34Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. MacDonald S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell.

The Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases plays an important role in the regulation of cell adhesion, growth, and differentiation through the activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways (39Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 40Schwartzberg P.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Src kinase normally is maintained in an inactive state but can be transiently activated during cellular events such as mitosis or constitutively activated by abnormal events such as mutation (39Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The activation of Src occurs as a result of disruption of negative regulatory processes that normally suppress Src tyrosine kinase activity (40Schwartzberg P.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Recently we determined that exposure of NIH 3T3 cells to H2O2 also resulted in stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity (41Lee M. Petrovics G. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of cells with H2O2 in combination with PMA to stimulate PKCϵ resulted in synergistic activation of Raf-1 (41Lee M. Petrovics G. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Here we have employed the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) to determine the possible involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in the modulation of H2O2/PMA stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity. PP2 is a potent inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases but only weakly inhibits ZAP-70 and JAK2 (42Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelianb P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of cells with PP2 to inhibit Src family kinase was found to enhance PMA/H2O2-mediated activation of Raf-1. These results indicate that the generation of H2O2 along with the activation of PKCϵ and inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinase all play an important role in the Ras-independent, sustained activation of Raf-1 kinase. Furthermore, the results presented here suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation events may be involved in both the stimulation and down-regulation of Raf-1 kinase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Rabbit polyclonal anti-Raf (C-12) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), whereas monoclonal mouse anti-Raf and anti-phosphotyrosine RC20H were from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Protein A-agarose was from Roche Applied Science. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Reagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PP2, GF 109203X, Gö 6976, and wortmannin were purchased from Calbiochem. Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2, PMA, and H2O2 were obtained from Sigma. PMA and PP2 were dissolved in Me2SO and freshly diluted for each experiment.Plasmid DNA—The pcDNA vector encoding a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (N17Ras) was kindly provided by Dr. Toren Finkel (NIH, Bethesda, MD) with Dr. Silvio Gutkind's (NIH, Bethesda, MD) permission. NIH 3T3/BXB Raf cells overexpressing N-terminally truncated and constitutively activated Raf-1 were produced by cloning into the pMTH vector (43Olah Z. Ferrier A. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The pcDNA-FLAG-Raf construct, obtained from Dr. Jeffrey E. DeClue (NIH, Bethesda, MD) with Dr. Richard Kolesnick's (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York) permission (44Zhang Y. Yao B. Delikat S. Bayoumy S. Lin X.H. Basu S. McGinley M. Chan-Hui P.Y. Lichenstein H. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1997; 89: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), was used as the template to generate FLAG-tagged Raf-1 point mutants using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The presence of point mutations was verified by DNA sequence analysis.Mammalian Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Parental and v-Ha-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and glutamine. Where indicated the cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA vector encoding the indicated FLAG-tagged Raf-1 point mutants or encoding dominant-negative Ras (N17Ras) by the electroporation method as specified by the manufacturer (BTX). After 48 h the transfected cells were serum-deprived overnight before treatment with PMA, H2O2, and PP2 as indicated.Preparation of Cell Lysates—The indicated treatments of cells were carried out at 37 °C in serum-free medium as described in the figure legends. After treatment whole cell lysates were prepared as follows. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping the cells into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 2 mm sodium fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and lysate protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay reagent kit as described by the manufacturer (Pierce).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation was performed on the whole cell lysates using either polyclonal anti-Raf or monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 and protein A-agarose beads. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer. For immunoblotting, immunoprecipitates were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by either 7.5 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblot analysis was performed using the antibody described in the figure legends. Endogenous Raf-1 kinase and the oncogenically active BXB Raf fragment (the C-terminal fragment starting with the amino acid 302 of c-Raf-1) were detected using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-Raf antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Immune complexes on nitrocellulose were detected by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescent images were captured using a CCD camera in a ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad) and saved to an IBM-PC computer. Bands were quantified using Quantity One analysis software, Version 4.4 (Bio-Rad).In Vitro Raf-1 Kinase Activity Assay—Raf-1 proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated from lysates of NIH 3T3 cells, washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2). Raf-1 kinase activity was measured by phosphorylation of recombinant MEK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as previously described (32Ferrier A.F. Lee M. Anderson W.B. Benvenuto G. Morrison D.K. Lowy D.R. DeClue J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2136-2142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The washed immunoprecipitates were incubated in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 mm ATP, 1 μg of the recombinant MEK, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of MEK inhibitor, PD 98059, which was used to inhibit the autokinase activity of MEK-1. Assays were terminated by the addition of gel-loading buffer. The samples were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated MEK protein bands were visualized by autoradiography.RESULTSThe Src-family Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor PP2 Markedly Enhanced PMA/H2O2-mediated Activation of Raf-1 Kinase—Our previous studies showed that simultaneous treatment of cells with H2O2 and PMA resulted in synergistic activation of Raf-1 kinase (41Lee M. Petrovics G. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Since tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to be an important event in Raf-1 activation (6Morrison D.K. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Dhillon A.S. Kolch W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and because one mechanism by which reactive oxygen species has been reported to modulate signal transduction pathway is via alteration in protein tyrosine phosphorylation (26Barrett W.C. DeGnore J.P. Keng Y.F. Zhang Z.Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34543-34546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 45Natarajan V. Scribner W.M. al-Hassani M. Vepa S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), several tyrosine kinase inhibitors were tested to determine their relative effects on Raf-1 kinase activation by the combination of PMA and H2O2. In these studies v-Ha-ras-transformed cells were used because these cells were found to be more susceptible to PMA and H2O2 activation than parental NIH 3T3 cells. In addition, NIH 3T3 cells expressing truncated BXB Raf also were used in these experiments. No apparent inhibition of PMA/H2O2-induced Raf-1 activation was observed with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors tested with the exception of AG490, an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine (Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, PP2, an inhibitor of Src-family tyrosine kinases (42Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelianb P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar), significantly increased PMA/H2O2-mediated activation of Raf-1 kinase (Fig. 1A). Importantly, PP2 showed an even greater stimulatory effect of PMA and H2O2 activation of constitutively active BXB Raf (the N-terminal deletion mutant of Raf-1) (Fig. 1B). The kinetics of Raf-1 activation after exposure of v-Ha-ras-transformed cells to PP2 are shown in Fig. 1C. It was found that promotion of PMA/H2O2-induced activation of Raf-1 was optimal within 30 min of PP2 treatment, and this level of activation was sustained through at least 4 h of exposure to PP2. The ability of PP2 to enhance PMA/H2O2 activation of Raf-1 decreased after 12 h of treatment and approached control levels of Raf-1 kinase activity by 24 h of exposure to PP2 (inset, Fig. 1C).PP2 Blocked PMA and H2O2-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Raf-1 and BXB Raf—Next, studies were carried out to determine whether PP2 treatment inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 noted with exposure of v-Ha-ras-transformed (Fig. 2A) and BXB Raf-overexpressing (Fig. 2B) NIH 3T3 cells to PMA and H2O2. In this experiment both Raf-1 and the BXB Raf fragment were immunoprecipitated using anti-Raf antibody, and the presence of phosphotyrosine was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown, the presence of PP2 blocked the slight increase in Raf-1 (Fig. 2A) and BXB Raf (Fig. 2B) tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PMA and H2O2. There was no change in the levels of either Raf-1 or BXB Raf protein under these conditions, as determined by reprobing the stripped immunoblots with anti-Raf antibody.Fig. 2Treatment of cells with PP2 inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation (P-tyr) of Raf-1 and BXB Raf induced by exposure to PMA and H2O2. Panel A, v-Ha-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells serum-deprived for 24 h were pretreated in the presence and absence of PP2 as indicated for 30 min before stimulation with 100 nm PMA and/or 1 mm H2O2 for 5 min. IP, immunoprecipitation. Ab, antibody. Panel B, BXB Raf-overexpressing NIH 3T3 cells serum-deprived for 24 h were pretreated with and without 10 μm PP2 for 30 min before stimulation with the combination of 100 nm PMA and 1 mm H2O2 for 5 min. In panels A and B, Raf-1 and BXB Raf proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-Raf antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The presence of phosphotyrosine was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20H. The same blots were stripped and then reprobed with anti-Raf-1 antibody to determine the amount of Raf-1 and BXB Raf protein present in each lane. The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Stimulatory Effect of PP2 Is Ras-independent—The phorbol ester tumor promoter PMA serves as a potent, non-physiological activator of PKC by acting as a mimic of diacylglycerol, an endogenous activator of PKC. Thus, studies were carried out with the diacylglycerol analogue, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) to determine whether OAG can replace PMA to induce synergistic activation of Raf-1 in combination with H2O2. Although not as effective as PMA, simultaneous treatment of cells with OAG along with H2O2 did result in transient activation of Raf-1 (Fig. 3A). Raf-1 activation by OAG/H2O2 reached its peak within 5–10 min after treatment and was found to be markedly enhanced by pretreatment of cells with PP2. Conversely, PP2 showed no effect on PDGF-induced Raf-1 kinase activation, which is Ras-dependent (Fig. 3B). Thus, experiments were carried out to determine whether Ras is required for PP2 stimulation of Raf-1 activation induced by PMA/H2O2. Inhibition of Ras function was achieved by transient transfection with a vector encoding dominant-negative Ras (RasN17). As shown in Fig. 3C, expression of dominant-negative RasN17 to block Ras function did not inhibit the PMA/H2O2-induced activation of Raf-1 noted in the presence of PP2. However, in experiments carried out to establish that expression of RasN17 in these cells effectively blocked Ras function, as determined by inhibition of PDGF-induced ERK phosphorylation, it was found that the elevated levels of ERK phosphorylation noted with v-Ha-ras-transformed cells made it difficult to detect consistent, significant stimulation of ERK phosphorylation induced by PDGF alone. Thus, parental NIH 3T3 cells were used to establish that expression of RasN17 did block Ras function, as determined by inhibition of PDGF-induced stimulation of ERK phosphorylation, but had a much less pronounced effect on PMA/H2O2-induced ERK activation (Fig. 3C, inset). Importantly, transient transfection of RasN17 into NIH 3T3 cells did not significantly block PMA/H2O2/PP2-induced activation of Raf-1. These results established that PMA/H2O2-induced activation of Raf-1 was Ras-independent. Of added interest was the finding that the presence of PP2 did not enhance PMA/H2O2-induced ERK activation with v-Ha-ras-transformed cells, as determined by increased ERK phosphorylation, despite the noted hyperactivation of Raf-1 under these conditions (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that PMA/H2O2/PP2-mediated activation of Raf-1 did not appear to potentiate signaling through the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway.Fig. 3PP2 potentiation of Raf-1 activity is Ras-independent and specific to the activation induced by PMA or OAG and H O. Panel A, PP2 also enhanced Raf-1 kinase activation by the combination of the diacylglycerol analogue OAG and H2O2. Subconfluent v-Ha-ras-transformed cells were serum-deprived for 24 h and then exposed to 10 μm PP2 where indicated for 30 min before treatment with the combination of 50 μm OAG and 1 mm H2O2 for the times indicated. Panel B, PP2 does not enhance the ability of PDGF to stimulate Raf-1 kinase. Subconfluent NIH 3T3 cells were serum-deprived for 24 h along with exposure to the indicated tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the following time periods. The serum-deprived cells were treated with 60 μm genistein for the final 60 min, with 10 μm PP2 for the final 30 min, with 50 μm AG1296 (PDGFR kinase inhibitor) for the final 4 h, and with 50 μm AG1478 (epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor) for the final 30 min before exposure to 20 ng/ml PDG"

Proposing mechanisms of retinoid transfer between these binding proteins and membrane-associated retinoid-metabolizing enzymes requires insight into enzyme topology. We therefore determined the topology of mouse retinol dehydrogenase type 1 (Rdh1) and cis-retinoid androgen dehydrogenase type 1 (Crad1) in the endoplasmic reticulum of intact mammalian cells. The properties of Rdh1 were compared with a chimera with a luminal signaling sequence (11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD1)(1-41)/Rdh1(23-317); the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins Rdh1(1-22)/GFP, Crad1(1-22)/GFP, and 11β-HSD1(1-41)/GFP; and signaling sequence charge difference mutants using confocal immunofluorescence, antibody access, proteinase K sensitivity, and deglycosylation assays. An N-terminal signaling sequence of 22 residues, consisting of a hydrophobic helix ending in a net positive charge, anchors Rdh1 and Crad1 in the endoplasmic reticulum facing the cytoplasm. Mutating arginine to glutamine in the signaling sequence did not affect topology. Inserting one or two arginine residues near the N terminus of the signaling sequence caused 28-95% inversion from cytoplasmic to luminal, depending on the net positive charge remaining at the C terminus of the signaling sequence; e.g. the mutant L3R,L5R,R16Q,R19Q,R21Q faced the lumen. Experiments with N- and C-terminal epitope-tagged Rdh1 and molecular modeling indicated that a hydrophobic helix-turn-helix near the C terminus of Rdh1 (residues 289-311) projects into the cytoplasm. These data provide insight into the features necessary to orient type III (reverse signal-anchor) proteins and demonstrate that Rdh1, Crad1, and other short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases, which share similar N-terminal signaling sequences such as human Rdh5 and mouse Rdh4, orient with their catalytic domains facing the cytoplasm.

Dehydrogenation of retinol in the presence of excess CRBP with concentrations of both ligand and binding protein in the micromolar range indicates that the reaction proceeds through the SDR accessing CRBP-bound retinol because the CRBP-retinol complex has a Kd value ∼0.1 nm, which would virtually eliminate unbound retinol. Close approach of the two has been confirmed by cross-linking of holo-CRBP with microsomal Rdh (9Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 34: 7027-7037Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although Rdhs that recognize holo-CRBP also occur in cytoplasm, they are inhibited severely by a small excess of apoCRBP (10Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Even uninhibited cytosolic enzymes make a quantitatively minor contribution to the total retinal-generating units. In contrast to SDR, the cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase isozymes do not recognize CRBP-retinol in vitro (10Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Moreover alcohol dehydrogenase access to physiological amounts of unbound retinol in intact cells may be limited because retinol has very low solubility in aqueous media when not sequestered tightly with CRBP. Notably gene knock-out experiments did not provide evidence for an alcohol dehydrogenase contribution to retinol metabolism under normal circumstances, because Adh1-/-, Adh3-/-, Adh4-/-, and dual Adh1/Adh4-/- null mice showed no retinoic acid deficiency phenotype nor any disturbance of retinoid metabolism or compensatory response (12Molotkov A.

Proposing precise models of retinoid transfer between these retinoid-binding proteins and retinoid-metabolizing enzymes requires understanding the topology of the enzymes. The retinoid-metabolizing, membrane-associated SDRs, including rRodh1, Rdh1, hRdh-E/Rodh4, and bovine 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase/hRdh5/mRdh4, consist of N-terminal hydrophobic helices of ∼18 residues flanked on the C terminus by net positive charges, midprotein hydrophobic helix-loop-helix transmembrane regions, and hydrophobic helices of ∼23 residues close to their C termini. Several models have been proposed for their association with the ER. An early model suggested that all four of the hRoDH4 hydrophobic helices transected the ER membrane (7Gough W.H. Van Ooteghem S. Sint T. Kedishvili N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 19778-19785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A second model presented 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase with its N- and C-terminal hydrophobic helices projecting through the ER membrane with the bulk of the protein facing the lumen (23Simon A. Romert A. Gustafson A.L. McCaffery J.M. Eriksson U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SDR Crad1 and the 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase orthologs Rdh4/5 also have been proposed as luminal facing (24Tryggvason K. Romert A. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19253-19258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Another model presented rRodh1 as a type III (also known as reverse signal-anchor) protein with the N-terminal signaling sequence buried in the ER membrane but as a globular SDR projecting into the cytoplasm (25Wang J. Bongianni J.K. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12533-12540Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this model, the C-terminal helix associated with the surface of the ER. All these models cannot be accurate in view of the amino acid similarity among these closely related SDRs especially in their putative N-terminal signaling sequences. The goals of this study were to determine whether the Rdh1 localizes exclusively to the ER membrane; the topology of Rdh1 by comparing its behavior in intact cells with luminal facing proteins for proteinase sensitivity, access to antibodies, and glycosylation; and the molecular features that establish ER retinoid dehydrogenase membrane expression locus and topology. cDNA Constructs—Constructs were made by PCR (primers are detailed in the Supplemental material) and were sequenced. pcDNA3/Rdh1 was used as the template for the Rdh1 mutants (4Zhang M. Chen W. Smith S.M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44083-44090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutants and their primers (forward/reverse, respectively) included RD(1-18), F1/R1; RD(1-30), F2/R1; RD(289-317), F3/R2; and RD2, F1/R2. Point mutations were introduced into Rdh1 by overlapping PCR. Mutant glycosylation site at residue 213 was made using the primer pairs F3/R3 and F4/R1 to amplify the 5′- and 3′-sections of Rdh1. The gel-purified products were used as templates with primers F3/R1 to make the mutant V213N. Similarly mutant G251N was obtained with primer pairs F5/R4 and F3/R1 and was used to make the mutant L253T. Additional mutants and primer pairs included R19Q, F6/R5 and F3/R1; R21Q, F7/R6 and F3/R1; and R(19,21)2Q, F8/R7 and F3/R1. Mutant R(16,19,21)3Q was obtained with primer pairs F9/R8 and F3/R1 using the double mutant R(19,21)2Q as template. Mutants L(3,5)2R, L(3,5)2R/R(19,21)2Q, and L(3,5)2R/R(16,19,21)3Q were generated with primers F10/R1. Mutants with an arginine residue inserted after the second Rdh1 residue R3, R3/19Q, R3/21Q, R3/(19,21)2Q, and R3/(16,19,21)3Q, were made with the primer pair F11/R1. To obtain the chimeric 11β-HSD1(1-41)/Rdh1(23-317), a PCR product coding for the first 41 amino acid residues of human 11β-HSD1 was amplified with primers F12/R9 and digested with EcoRI/StuI. The DNA fragment encoding amino acids 23-317 of Rdh1 was obtained with primers F13/R1 and digested with PmlI/XhoI. A sequence coding for the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was attached to the N or C termini of Rdh1 to generate FLAG-Rdh and Rdh-FLAG with primer pairs F14/R1 and F3/R10, respectively. Rdh1 mutants were subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). GFP constructs were cloned into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences). To obtain Rdh(1-22)/GFP, a DNA fragment encoding the first 22 residues of Rdh1 was amplified with primers F3/R14 and digested with EcoRI/PvuII. A second DNA fragment encoding the coding region of GFP was amplified with primers F16/R11 and digested with PmlI/NotI. The two fragments were cloned. Rdh(1-18)/GFP was made with primers F3/R12, digested with EcoRI/DraI, and cloned with the second DNA fragment described above. Overlapping PCR was used to generate mutant GFP/Rdh(289-317) with primers F18/R13 and F19/R14 and cloned. Plasmid Crad1(1-22)/GFP was constructed with primers F3/R15 and F20/R11, and the chimeric DNA fragment was cloned. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blotting—COS cells (ATCC) were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells on 100-mm plates were transfected with 8 μg of plasmid DNA using 40 μl of SuperFect (Qiagen). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, 5 × 107 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold HB (150 μm MgCl2,10mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) plus protease inhibitors and left on ice for 5 min. The cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation at 4 °C (80 p.s.i./30 min). The suspension was then homogenized by five gentle strokes of a Dounce grinder with a loose pestle. An additional ⅓ volume ice-cold HB with 1 m sucrose was added to the cell suspension and mixed well. The nuclei, cell debris, and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended with 5 ml of buffer B (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) plus protease inhibitors. This homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min to obtain a crude mitochondrial pellet. The crude mitochondria pellet was resuspended by five gentle strokes with a Dounce grinder, layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (30, 40, and 55%), and centrifuged at 150,000 × g with an SW41 rotor for 20 min at 4 °C. The mitochondria fraction was collected from the 40/55% interface, diluted with 5 volumes of buffer B, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was solubilized in buffer B. The microsomal fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the postmitochondrial supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h and was rehomogenized in buffer B. For Western blotting, 10 μg of protein were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Results were imaged with an ECL-Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Deglycosylation—Deglycosylation was done with PNGase F (New England Biolabs). A mixture of denatured proteins (1× Glycoprotein Denature Buffer, 100 °C, 10 min) with 0.1 volume each of 10× G7 buffer and 10% Nonidet P-40 and 2 μl of PNGase F (500,000 units/ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Mixtures were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Protease Protection—cDNA constructs were transfected into COS cells cultured in 6-well plates with SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed three times in PBS and trypsinized with 300 μl of trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) for 10 min at 37 °C. Trypsinized cells were resuspended in PBS, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized (5 min, 37 °C) by addition of 200 μl of SLO in PBS (1000 units/ml). Alternatively cells were treated with 200 μl of PBS or 200 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS under the same conditions. Cells were then treated with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min. Digestion was stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) and 100 μl of 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1.5 m sucrose, 6 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitor mixture (BD Biosciences). Cells were lysed by sonication. Immunoblotting was done as described above using anti-Rdh1 or anti-GFP monoclonal antibody. Antibodies and Fluorescence Markers—Subconfluent COS cells grown on coverslips were transfected with SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in SLO buffer (75 mm potassium acetate, 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2) and fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS) at room temperature for 15 min. After washing, cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 500 units/ml activated SLO (Sigma). SLO was removed, and the cells were washed once and incubated in SLO buffer for 15 min at 37 °C to allow pore formation. Alternatively fixed cells were incubated in PBS or 0.2% Triton X-100 (containing 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. Some fixed cells were permeabilized with digitonin (5 μg/ml) for 15 min at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA. Permeabilized cells were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with anti-Rdh1 (1:200, raised in rabbits against the peptide DRLSSNTKMIWDKASSEVK), anti-GFP (1:200, monoclonal antibody JL-8, BD Biosciences), or anti-calnexin (1:200, Sigma) followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (5 μg/ml) or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (5 μg/ml) for another 1 h. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) was used for FLAG epitope detection (Sigma). Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated ConA or MitoTracker Red CMXRos (both from Molecular Probes) were used as ER or mitochondria markers, respectively. DAPI was used for nuclear counterstaining. Cells were mounted in ProLong Antifade reagents (Molecular Probes), viewed under a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope, and processed with Zeiss Bitplane Imaris 3.3 software. Molecular Modeling—The molecular model was generated with Swiss-Model Version 36.0002, based on three-dimensional structures of soluble SDR, using an optimal amino acid sequence alignment as described previously (26Song M.-S.

Only the ER Expresses Rdh1—The N terminus of Rdh1 has characteristics of a dual mitochondria/microsomal signaling sequence. The first 18 amino acid residues form a hydrophobic helix sufficiently long to span a lipid bilayer membrane and are flanked by the positively charged residues Arg19, Arg21, and Lys30 (Fig. 1). This resembles N-terminal signaling sequences in enzymes expressed dually by ER and mitochondria, such as CYP1A1, CYP2E1, and P450MT2 (32Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V.

We expressed Rdh1 in COS cells and determined its locus in subcellular fractions by immunoblotting and in intact cells by immunofluorescence. Immunoblotting (Fig. 1) revealed Rdh1 in the microsomal and mitochondria fractions, distributing with calnexin, an ER membrane protein (35Bergeron J.J. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c, a mitochondria intermembrane space protein, appeared only in the mitochondria fraction. These results are consistent with reports of ER protein contamination of mitochondria even after their isolation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (36Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G.

The density of the Rdh1 signal relative to the calnexin signal remained the same in both the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions, indicating that only the ER expresses Rdh1. Immunofluorescence of intact cells confirmed these observations (Fig. 2, a and b). Rdh1 colocalized with ConA, an ER marker, but did not colocalize with MitoTracker.Fig. 2Expression of Rdh1 and deletion mutants in intact cells. Rdh1 and deletion mutants were immunostained in fixed COS cells permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The left column shows immunostaining using anti-Rdh1 as the primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (green). The middle column alternates showing Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated ConA (a, c, f, and h) or MitoTracker (Mito) Red CMXRos (b, d, e, g, and i) (both red) as microsomal and mitochondria markers, respectively, with the exception of RD(1-30), which shows only MitoTracker. The right column shows a merged image of the left and middle columns. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue): a and b, Rdh1; c and d, RD(1-18); e, RD(1-30); f and g, RD(289-317); h and i, RD2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N-terminal Signaling Sequence Targets Rdh1 to the ER—Rdh1 has hydrophobic helices at its N terminus (residues 1-18) and near its C terminus (residues 289-311). We made deletion mutants to determine whether one or both contribute to ER targeting (Fig. 1). Mutants RD(1-18) or RD(1-30), which lack the first 18 and 30 amino acid residues of Rdh1, respectively, did not localize to the ER. Surprisingly both distributed in the mitochondria fraction with cytochrome c and localized in mitochondria in intact cells (Figs. 1 and 2, c, d, and e). These data show that residues 1-18 and residues 1-30 are necessary for ER localization but do not demonstrate whether they are sufficient. The deletion mutant RD(289-317) produced immunoblot signals in both the microsomal and mitochondria fractions but predominantly in the mitochondria. Immunofluorescence confirmed this: only ∼20% of transfected cells showed ER localization, whereas the rest exhibited the punctate signal of mitochondria expression (Figs. 1 and 2, f and g). Deletion of both the 18 N-terminal and the 28 C-terminal residues, mutant RD2, generated a protein that localized overwhelmingly in the mitochondria (Figs. 1 and 2, h and i). Thus, the N-terminal signaling sequence directs Rdh1 to the ER, the C-region hydrophobic helix may promote ER retention, and removing both does not generate a soluble protein. To further define the function of the N- and C-terminal hydrophobic helices, we determined the loci of Rdh1/GFP fusion proteins by immunofluorescence. Native GFP had a diffuse pattern, distributing throughout the cell (not shown). Fusing the first 22 residues of Rdh1 to GFP (Rdh1(1-22)/GFP) produced a protein with an ER expression pattern, demonstrating that these residues are sufficient to cause ER targeting (Fig. 3). In contrast, the fusion protein Rdh1(1-18)/GFP, with only the first 18 N-terminal residues fused to GFP, showed a diffuse signal, indicating that the first 18 residues alone are not sufficient for ER targeting. The fusion protein of GFP and the last 29 Rdh1 amino acid residues, GFP/Rdh1(289-317), also showed a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear signal with an intense band in the nuclear membrane. These data show that the 22 N-terminal residues, but not the last 29 C-terminal residues, of Rdh1 are sufficient to direct and anchor the soluble protein GFP to the ER. Rdh1 Faces the Cytoplasm—We assessed access of antibodies to Rdh1 expressed in COS cells treated with SLO, digitonin, or Triton X-100. SLO selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane by binding to cholesterol and polymerizing to create pores ≥12 nm, permitting uptake of large molecules (38Palmer M. Vulicevic I. Saweljew P.

To place the Rdh1 results into context with a luminal facing SDR, we made a chimera of the first 41 N-terminal residues of h11β-HSD1 fused to the N terminus of GFP. These residues contain a signaling sequence, bounded near their N terminus by two lysine residues and bounded on their C terminus by two glutamate residues, that direct h11β-HSD1 into the ER facing the lumen (39Ozols J.

https://openalex.org/W2149240481,"Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICAR Tfase), one of the two folate-dependent enzymes in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, is a promising target for anti-neoplastic chemotherapy. Although classic antifolates, such as methotrexate, have been developed as anticancer agents, their general toxicity and drug resistance are major issues associated with their clinical use and future development. Identification of inhibitors with novel scaffolds could be an attractive alternative. We present here the crystal structure of avian AICAR Tfase complexed with the first non-folate based inhibitor identified through virtual ligand screening of the National Cancer Institute Diversity Set. The inhibitor 326203-A (2-[5-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-(2-methyl-4-sulfophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-ylazo]-4-sulfo-benzoic acid) displayed competitive inhibition against the natural cofactor, 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, with a Ki of 7.1 μm. The crystal structure of AICAR Tfase with 326203-A at 1.8 Å resolution revealed a unique binding mode compared with antifolate inhibitors. The inhibitor also accessed an additional binding pocket that is not occupied by antifolates. The sulfonate group of 326203-A appears to form the dominant interaction of the inhibitor with the proposed oxyanion hole through interaction with a helix dipole and Lys267. An aromatic interaction with Phe316 also likely contributes to favorable binding. Based on these structural insights, several inhibitors with improved potency were subsequently identified in the National Cancer Institute Compound Library and the Available Chemical Directory by similarity search and molecular modeling methods.

The biological significance of the folate cofactor stems from the key role that folates play as one-carbon carriers in several important metabolic pathways, including de novo purine and thymidylate synthesis. The recognition of the critical role of reduced folates for the synthesis of DNA precursors led to the discovery of folate analogues as anti-metabolite agents. Antifolates typically interfere with the binding of the natural cofactor to key enzymes in these biosynthetic pathways, such as thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GAR Tfase), 1The abbreviations used are: GAR Tfase, glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase; 10-f-THF, 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate; AICAR, aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide; AICAR Tfase, AICAR transformylase; IMPCH, IMP cyclohydrolase; BME, β-mercaptoethanol; MAI, multisubstrate adduct inhibitor; rmsd, root mean square deviation; ATIC, AICAR Tfase/IMPCH. and AICAR Tfase. The first generation of antifolates, aminopterin and methotrexate, heralded the era of anti-metabolite cancer chemotherapy (1Farber S. Diamond L.K. Mercer R.D. Sylvester R.F. Wolff J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1948; 238: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Subsequent design and development of folate analogues has led to new generations of antifolates, some currently under clinical evaluation. For example, pemetrexed (ALIMTA) can bind multiple targets, such as thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, GAR Tfase, and AICAR Tfase, and is one of the most promising of these current antifolates. Pemetrexed exhibits antitumor activity in several types of solid tumors (2Hanauskse A.R. Chen V. Paoletti P. Niyikiza C. Oncologist. 2001; 6: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and its phase III clinical trial has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Nevertheless, general toxicity issues associated with antifolates have posed major challenges for folate analogue development. Folic acid and its cellular derivatives function mainly in their fully reduced form and are involved in many cellular metabolic pathways, such as cell proliferation and amino acid metabolism. Because at least 18 folate-dependent enzymes are involved in 1-carbon transfer reactions, as well as transformation of folate cofactors themselves, in human cells, antifolate agents often inhibit multiple pathways, resulting in adverse cytotoxic side effects. One such example is methotrexate, whose general toxicity stems from the inhibition of several folate-dependent enzymes involved in methionine biosynthesis, thymidylate synthesis, and de novo purine biosynthesis (3Calvert H. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar). Lometrexol is a selective inhibitor to GAR Tfase (nm) in de novo purine biosynthesis, but can also inhibit AICAR Tfase at higher concentrations (4Kamen B. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: 30-39Google Scholar). Although lometrexol has exhibited promising anti-neoplastic activity, it was suspended from further clinical evaluation because of folate depletion after administration of the drug (4Kamen B. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: 30-39Google Scholar). However, more recent studies have indicated that supplementation with folate can reduce its toxicity (5Roberts J.D. Poplin E.A. Tombes M.B. Kyle B. Spicer D.V. Grant S. Synold T. Moran R. Cancer Chemotherapy Pharmacol. 2000; 45: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Currently, substantial efforts have been focused on specific tailoring of folate analogues to individual enzymatic targets to achieve greater selectivity, as well as increased potency. Nevertheless, only a limited number of antifolates for cancer chemotherapy have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical applications, including methotrexate and raltitrexed, a thymidylate synthase inhibitor for treatment of colon cancer in Europe (3Calvert H. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibitors with novel scaffolds that differ from traditional antifolates are attractive because they are unlikely to produce the same undesired side effects. Moreover, such classes of inhibitors would not necessarily possess a glutamate or multiple glutamates as in traditional antifolates and would eliminate the requirement for active transport, a frequent source of antifolate drug resistance. Nevertheless, the added folate requirement in tumor cells leads to up-regulation of these folate transporters and increased accumulation of folates and antifolates in tumor cells. Thus, bypassing of the active transport system and reliance on passive diffusion raises its own challenges for selective uptake into tumor cells to obtain an efficacious chemotherapeutic agent. In this study, a virtual ligand screening approach via docking was undertaken to search for inhibitors of AICAR Tfase with novel scaffolds. AICAR Tfase/IMPCH (ATIC), which catalyzes the last two steps in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, is a promising target for the development of therapeutic intervention in various types of cancer (6Christopherson R.I. Lyons S.D. Wilson P.K. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The de novo purine biosynthesis pathway consists of 10 enzymatic reactions that sequentially convert 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophospate to IMP. The homodimeric ATIC is a bifunctional enzyme composed of two distinct active sites. The high resolution crystal structure of ATIC (7Greasley S.E. Horton P. Ramcharan J. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) revealed that the C-terminal domain (residues 200–593) contains the AICAR Tfase activity, which catalyzes formyl transfer from the cofactor 10-f-THF to AICAR producing 5-formyl-AICAR (Fig. 1) in the penultimate step of purine biosynthesis. The N-terminal IMPCH domain (residue 1–199) is responsible for the final cyclohydrolase ring closure step that converts 5-formyl-AICAR to IMP (Fig. 1). The IMPCH active site and catalytic mechanism have been elucidated by the structure of ATIC complexed with the IMPCH domain inhibitor, xanthosine 5′-monophosphate (8Wolan D.W. Greasley S.E. Beardsley G.P. Wilson I.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15505-15513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Wolan D.W. Cheong C.-G. Greasley S.E. Wilson I.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1171-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of ATIC with the substrate AICAR (8Wolan D.W. Greasley S.E. Beardsley G.P. Wilson I.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15505-15513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and two sulfonyl-containing folate inhibitors, BW1540 and BW2315, have illuminated the cofactor-binding site (10Cheong C.G.

The crystal structure of a multisubstrate adduct inhibitor β-DADF (MAI), mimicking both the substrate AICAR and the cofactor when complexed with ATIC, unambiguously demonstrated that the AICAR Tfase active site was located at the dimer interface and identified putative key catalytic residues (11Wolan D.W. Greasley S.E. Wall M.J. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10904-10914Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the complexed structures revealed that AICAR Tfase possesses an unusually large active site, with unoccupied binding pockets and cavities even when both AICAR and cofactor are bound. Thus, the structural information provides invaluable guidelines for the rational design of novel inhibitor scaffolds. ATIC has no structural or sequence similarity to any other folate-dependent enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis pathways. In addition, no clinically useful inhibitors for ATIC have been developed to date, which underscores the opportunity to pursue structure-based inhibitor design targeting of ATIC. Molecular docking and de novo design are widely used in the discovery of enzyme inhibitors with the desired selectivity and potency profiles. Virtual screening of the structural database of known and commercially available small molecules can rapidly generate lead compounds with complementary shapes and favorable hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions within the active site of the target (12Shoichet B.K. Stroud R.M. Santi D.V. Kuntz I.D. Perry K.M. Science. 1993; 259: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Such docking studies also enable discovery of novel ligands with chemical scaffolds that are dissimilar to those already tested. Here, we describe the outcome of the molecular docking strategy for the discovery of novel inhibitors of ATIC, where crystal structures of ATIC provided the necessary entry points for the docking and rational design of inhibitors. Compounds from the National Cancer Institute Diversity Set were docked into the three-dimensional structure of human ATIC using AutoDock. The screening led to the identification of 44 new compounds with distinct chemical structures, compared with traditional antifolates, that inhibited ATIC (13Li C. Xu L. Wolan D.W. Wilson I.A. Olson A.J. J. Med. Chem. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). In vitro inhibition assays confirmed that 8 of the 16 compounds that had good solubility in water surprisingly inhibited AICAR Tfase activity at the micromolar level. To establish the structural basis for their specificity and affinity, we determined the crystal structure of ATIC with one of the most potent inhibitors identified from the screening effort. Thus, we report here the discovery of a new class of inhibitors that bind to ATIC with a binding mode that differs from the traditional folate-based inhibitors. The crystal structure of ATIC complexed with one of the novel inhibitors, 326203-A, a commercially available dye named Acid Yellow 54, at 1.8 Å resolution (Fig. 2) has revealed the key enzyme-inhibitor interactions that now provide a valuable structural template for further improvement via rational design. Materials—LB and agar were obtained from Invitrogen. All common buffers and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The inhibitor candidates were obtained from the National Cancer Institute Open Chemical Repository (Bethesda, MD) and the Sigma-Aldrich Library of Rare Chemicals. Protein Expression and Purification—The plasmid pET28a, encoding the N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged human ATIC (kindly provided by Dr. G. Peter Beardsley, Yale University), was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21.DE3 cells (Novagen) by heat shock. The E. coli transformants were grown in 2YT medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C to an A600 value around 0.7 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Invitrogen) overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and were resuspended in 100 ml of solution of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (BME) (Buffer A). The resultant mixture was disrupted by sonication, as described previously (8Wolan D.W. Greasley S.E. Beardsley G.P. Wilson I.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15505-15513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 50 min. The supernatant was incubated with nickel affinity beads (Qiagen) overnight before transferring to a 2.5 × 10 cm Econo column (Bio-Rad) and further washing with 10 column volumes of Buffer A. The protein was eluted with a 10–250 mm imidazole gradient. Fractions containing protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and further purified on a Superdex 200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm BME, with or without 5 mm EDTA. The peak fractions were again analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled. The plasmid pET28a, encoding the avian ATIC cDNA with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (a kind gift from Dr. Stephen J. Benkovic), was transformed into E. coli BL21.DE3 cells (Novagen, Inc.) for overexpression. Avian ATIC was purified in the same manner as human ATIC (10Cheong C.G. Wolan D.W. Greasley S.E. Horton P.A.

All crystallographic water molecules and active site ligands were removed. The protonation states of His residues were assigned as follows: HD1 on His267, His385, His469, His584, and His592; HE2 on His213, His290, His293, His453, His470, and His591. Non-polar hydrogens were merged with heavy atoms, and Kollman charges (14Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem.

The active site in the homodimer that had lower average B values (2 monomers/asymmetric unit) was chosen as the docking site. A 60 × 50 × 66 three-dimensional energy grid with 0.375 Å spacing was calculated for each of the following atom types: carbon, A (aromatic carbon), nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, iron, phosphorus, and e (electrostatic) using Autogrid3 (15Morris G.M.

The docking screenings were carried out with AutoDock3.0.5 (15Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9199) Google Scholar), and the jobs were distributed to the Scripps Atlas SGI Origin 2000 cluster, the NBCR Meteor, and the UCSD KeckII linux clusters. The National Cancer Institute Diversity Set (dtp.nci.nih.gov/branches/dscb/diversity_explanation.html) (1990 compounds with a rich structural and pharmacophore diversity) was chosen as the compound library. All-atom Gasteiger charges were added, and non-polar hydrogens were merged with their connecting heavy atoms (16Gasteiger J. Marsili M. Tetrahedron. 1980; 36: 3219-3228Crossref Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). The simulation parameters were: trials of 100, population size of 150, random starting position and conformation, translation step of 0.5 Å, rotation step of 35°, elitism of 1, mutation rate of 0.02, cross-over rate of 0.8, local search rate of 0.06, and 10 million energy evaluations. Final docked conformations were clustered using a tolerance of 1.5 Å root mean square deviation (rmsd). The top compounds were picked based on the higher binding energies. Preparation of 10-f-THF—10-f-THF was prepared by a modified procedure of Rowe (17Rowe P.B. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18B: 733-735Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Black et al. (18Black S.L. Black M.J. Mangum J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 10 mg of (6R,S)-5-f-THF (Schircks Laboratories, Jona, Switzerland) was dissolved in 500 μl of 3.5 m BME, and 12 m HCl was then added to adjust the pH to 1–2. This solution was flushed with nitrogen and stored at 4 °C for 3 days. Yellow precipitate of (6R,S)-5,10-methenyl-THF formed and was harvested by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitates were resuspended in 5 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m BME. The conversion of (6R,S)-5, 10-methenyl-THF to 10-f-THF was monitored by the decrease of the UV absorbance at 356 nm (A356) and was usually complete after 3 h. The concentration of 10-f-THF was determined by A298 using the extinction coefficient of 9.54 × 103 cm-1m-1 (18Black S.L. Black M.J. Mangum J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). AICAR Tfase Inhibition Assay—The human ATIC enzyme was used for the inhibition assay. In an initial screen to determine approximate Ki values, 1 mg of each compound was dissolved in 100 μl of Me2SO and diluted to 1 mm using the assay buffer (32.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm BME) as described previously (19Boger D.L.

Benkovic S.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The assay buffer was flushed with nitrogen to minimize oxidization of 10-f-THF. The Me2SO used in this assay did not have any inhibitory effect on the activity of ATIC. 25 nm of human ATIC, 10 μm inhibitors, and different concentrations of cofactor 10-f-THF were mixed in the assay buffer to a volume of 150 μl and incubated for 2 min. The reaction was initiated by adding 50 μm of substrate AICAR (total volume, 300 μl). Using a SpectraMax Plus384 microplate reader, the reaction was monitored at 298 nm by measuring the increase in absorbance corresponding to the formation of THF. The THF was generated in the transfer reaction of the formyl group from cofactor to AICAR to produce 5-formyl-AICAR. IC50 values were measured at 25 nm ATIC, 50 μm AICAR, and 8.5 μm 10-f-THF. The Ki was obtained by generating plots of 1/Vi versus 1/[S] at several levels of inhibitor concentration, where the slopes of these plots are given by Equation 1.slope=KmVmaxKi[I]+KmVmax(Eq.1) The apparent Ki was obtained from the plot of these slopes versus [I], which generated a straight line with a y intercept of Km/Vmax and a x intercept of -Ki (22Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. Wiley Classics Library, New York1993: 100-160Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Because avian ATIC protein crystallizes more readily than human ATIC, apo avian ATIC was used for crystallization experiments. Apo avian ATIC crystals were grown at 22 °C, as described previously (7Greasley S.E. Horton P. Ramcharan J. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), via the sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volume of avian ATIC (10 mg/ml) with a reservoir solution consisting 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m imidazole, pH 7.2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Crystals of ATIC/326203-A complex were obtained by soaking a native avian ATIC crystal for 6 h with 10 mm 326203-A in mother liquor (20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m imidazole pH 7.2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Ethylene glycol at 20% was used as cryo-protectant. The data were collected on an ADSC 3 × 3 CCD detector at Beamline 11-1 at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The data were processed to 1.8 Å using DENZO-SCALE-PACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38567) Google Scholar). The crystal is isomorphous with the apo avian ATIC structure previously reported (7Greasley S.E. Horton P. Ramcharan J. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and was indexed in monoclinic space group P21, with cell dimensions of a = 64.8 Å, b = 105.3 Å, c = 102.4 Å, β = 108.1°. The Matthews' coefficient (Vm = 2.6 Å3/Da) (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar) indicated one dimer/asymmetric unit (solvent content of 51.9%). Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of ATIC with 326203-A was determined to 1.8 Å resolution by molecular replacement with AMoRe (CCP4 program suite) (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19764) Google Scholar) using the apo avian ATIC coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 1g8m) (7Greasley S.E. Horton P. Ramcharan J. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as the search model. The initial molecular replacement solution after rigid body refinement yielded a correlation coefficient of 53.4% and an Rvalue of 36.7% for data between 15 and 4 Å. The bound ligand was identified using the initial difference Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc electron density maps. Subsequent refinement was performed with CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar) using simulated annealing, conjugated gradient minimization, and individual B value refinement with intervening rounds of manual building using the graphic software O (27Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). A bulk solvent correction was applied throughout the entire refinement. Two-fold noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied for the initial five rounds of refinement and then released completely to accommodate any side-chain structural differences between the two monomers. The final model has Rcryst and Rfree values of 21.3 and 24.0%, respectively (see Table I). Because the electron density for one of the 326203-A inhibitors was weaker in one of the active sites in the dimer, most of the structural analysis presented here was carried out on the active site with the better ordered inhibitor.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData reductionSpace groupP21Unit cella = 64.8 Å, b = 105.3 Å, c = 102.4 Å, β = 108.1°No. of molecules asymmetric unit2 (one dimer)Resolution (Å)45-1.80 (1.85-1.80)aNumber in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shellUnique reflections115,630 (8413)Completeness (%)94.1 (92.1)Multiplicity3.3 (3.2)Average I/σ11.9 (4.6)Rsym (%)bRsym = Σh Σi|I (h)i - 〈I(h)〉|/Σh ΣiIi(h), where 〈I(h)〉 is the average intensity value of reflection10.1 (31.2)RefinementData cutoffFo > 0 σNo. of reflections (test set)113,750 (2836)Protein atoms9022Water molecules748Inhibitor atoms66Average protein (mol1) B value (Å2)25.0Average protein (mol2) B value (Å2)28.4Inhibitor (mol1) B value (Å2)36.6Inhibitor (mol2) B value (Å2)41.6Average solvent B value (Å2)33.8rmsd from idealBond length (Å)0.008Bond angle (deg)1.40Rcryst (%)cRcryst = Σh||Fo|-|Fc|/Σh|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes21.4 (24.6)Rfree (%)dRfree is the same as Rcryst, but for 2.5% of the data randomly omitted from refinement24.0 (28.8)Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored93.1Additionally allowed6.7Generously allowed0.2a Number in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shellb Rsym = Σh Σi|I (h)i - 〈I(h)〉|/Σh ΣiIi(h), where 〈I(h)〉 is the average intensity value of reflectionc Rcryst = Σh||Fo|-|Fc|/Σh|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudesd Rfree is the same as Rcryst, but for 2.5% of the data randomly omitted from refinement Open table in a new tab The model was analyzed with Procheck (28Laskowski R.A.

https://openalex.org/W2132510718,"Co-reconstitution of subunits E and G of the yeast V-ATPase and the α and β subunits of the F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase from the thermophilic <i>Bacillus</i> PS3 (TF<sub>1</sub>) resulted in an α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub>EG hybrid complex showing 53% of the ATPase activity of TF<sub>1</sub>. The α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub>EG oligomer was characterized by electron microscopy. By processing 40,000 single particle projections, averaged two-dimensional projections at 1.2–2.4-nm resolution were obtained showing the hybrid complex in various positions. Difference mapping of top and side views of this complex with projections of the atomic model of the α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub> subcomplex from TF<sub>1</sub> (Shirakihara, Y., Leslie, A. G., Abrahams, J. P., Walker, J. E., Ueda, T., Sekimoto, Y., Kambara, M., Saika, K., Kagawa, Y., and Yoshida, M. (1997) <i>Structure</i> 5, 825–836) demonstrates that a seventh mass is located inside the shaft of the α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub> barrel and extends out from the hexamer. Furthermore, difference mapping of the α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub>EG oligomer with projections of the A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>E and A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>EC subcomplexes of the V<sub>1</sub> from <i>Caloramator fervidus</i> (Chaban, Y., Ubbink-Kok, T., Keegstra, W., Lolkema, J. S., and Boekema, E. J. (2002) <i>EMBO Rep.</i> 3, 982–987) shows that the mass inside the shaft is made up of subunit E, whereby subunit G was assigned to belong at least in part to the density of the protruding stalk. The formation of an active α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub>EG hybrid complex indicates that the coupling subunit γ inside the α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub> oligomer of F<sub>1</sub> can be effectively replaced by subunit E of the V-ATPase. Our results have also demonstrated that the E and γ subunits are structurally similar, despite the fact that their genes do not show significant homology."
