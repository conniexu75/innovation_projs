https://openalex.org/W2028402416,"The cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) has shown promise in clinical trials for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using two mouse models, we show that the therapeutic dose of IL-10 can be reduced by localized delivery of a bacterium genetically engineered to secrete the cytokine. Intragastric administration of IL-10-secreting Lactococcus lactis caused a 50% reduction in colitis in mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium and prevented the onset of colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice. This approach may lead to better methods for cost-effective and long-term management of IBD in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2068334126,"Prion proteins can serve as genetic elements by adopting distinct physical and functional states that are self-perpetuating and heritable. The critical region of one prion protein, Sup35, is initially unstructured in solution and then forms self-seeded amyloid fibers. We examined in vitro the mechanism by which this state is attained and replicated. Structurally fluid oligomeric complexes appear to be crucial intermediates in de novo amyloid nucleus formation. Rapid assembly ensues when these complexes conformationally convert upon association with nuclei. This model for replicating protein-based genetic information, nucleated conformational conversion, may be applicable to other protein assembly processes."
https://openalex.org/W1670226482,"Chromosomal translocations that encode fusion oncoproteins have been observed consistently in leukemias/lymphomas and sarcomas but not in carcinomas, the most common human cancers. Here, we report that t(2;3)(q13;p25), a translocation identified in a subset of human thyroid follicular carcinomas, results in fusion of the DNA binding domains of the thyroid transcription factor PAX8 to domains A to F of the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (PPAR) γ1. PAX8-PPARγ1 mRNA and protein were detected in 5 of 8 thyroid follicular carcinomas but not in 20 follicular adenomas, 10 papillary carcinomas, or 10 multinodular hyperplasias. PAX8-PPARγ1 inhibited thiazolidinedione-induced transactivation by PPARγ1 in a dominant negative manner. The experiments demonstrate an oncogenic role for PPARγ and suggest that PAX8-PPARγ1 may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid carcinoma."

This pass with a previously unexamined orientation of the external forcing field distinguished between an induced and a permanent magnetic dipole moment model of Europa's internal field. The Galileo magnetometer measured changes in the magnetic field predicted if a current-carrying outer shell, such as a planet-scale liquid ocean, is present beneath the icy surface. The evidence that Europa's field varies temporally strengthens the argument that a liquid ocean exists beneath the present-day surface."
https://openalex.org/W1977355907,Reconstructing the impact of Heinrich events outside the main belt of ice rafting is crucial to understanding the underlying causes of these abrupt climatic events. A high-resolution study of a marine sediment core from the Iberian margin demonstrates that this midlatitude area was strongly affected both by cooling and advection of low-salinity arctic water masses during the last three Heinrich events. These paleoclimatic time series reveal the internal complexity of each of the last three Heinrich events and illustrate the value of parallel studies of the organic and inorganic fractions of the sediments.
https://openalex.org/W2081656219,"Contact-mediated axon repulsion by ephrins raises an unresolved question: these cell surface ligands form a high-affinity multivalent complex with their receptors present on axons, yet rather than being bound, axons can be rapidly repelled. We show here that ephrin-A2 forms a stable complex with the metalloprotease Kuzbanian, involving interactions outside the cleavage region and the protease domain. Eph receptor binding triggered ephrin-A2 cleavage in a localized reaction specific to the cognate ligand. A cleavage-inhibiting mutation in ephrin-A2 delayed axon withdrawal. These studies reveal mechanisms for protease recognition and control of cell surface proteins, and, for ephrin-A2, they may provide a means for efficient axon detachment and termination of signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1966252600,"Experiments exploring the potential catalytic role of iron sulfide at 250°C and elevated pressures (50, 100, and 200 megapascals) revealed a facile, pressure-enhanced synthesis of organometallic phases formed through the reaction of alkyl thiols and carbon monoxide with iron sulfide. A suite of organometallic compounds were characterized with ultraviolet-visible and Raman spectroscopy. The natural synthesis of such compounds is anticipated in present-day and ancient environments wherever reduced hydrothermal fluids pass through iron sulfide–containing crust. Here, pyruvic acid was synthesized in the presence of such organometallic phases. These compounds could have provided the prebiotic Earth with critical biochemical functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2113068240,"The arctic flora is thought to have originated during the late Tertiary, approximately 3 million years ago. Plant migration routes during colonization of the Arctic are currently unknown, and uncertainty remains over where arctic plants survived Pleistocene glaciations. A phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast DNA variation in the purple saxifrage ( Saxifraga oppositifolia ) indicates that this plant first occurred in the Arctic in western Beringia before it migrated east and west to achieve a circumpolar distribution. The geographical distribution of chloroplast DNA variation in the species supports the hypothesis that, during Pleistocene glaciations, some plant refugia were located in the Arctic as well as at more southern latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W1983717800,"Dolphin communication is suspected to be complex, on the basis of their call repertoires, cognitive abilities, and ability to modify signals through vocal learning. Because of the difficulties involved in observing and recording individual cetaceans, very little is known about how they use their calls. This report shows that wild, unrestrained bottlenose dolphins use their learned whistles in matching interactions, in which an individual responds to a whistle of a conspecific by emitting the same whistle type. Vocal matching occurred over distances of up to 580 meters and is indicative of animals addressing each other individually."
https://openalex.org/W2022835283,The complete crystallography of a one-dimensional crystal of potassium iodide encapsulated within a 1.6-nanometer-diameter single-walled carbon nanotube has been determined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Individual atoms of potassium and iodine within the crystal were identified from a phase image that was reconstructed with a modified focal series restoration approach. The lattice spacings within the crystal are substantially different from those in bulk potassium iodide. This is attributed to the reduced coordination of the surface atoms of the crystal and the close proximity of the van der Waals surface of the confining nanotube.
https://openalex.org/W2043893491,"Whereas T helper cells recognize peptide–major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II complexes through their T cell receptors (TCRs), CD4 binds to an antigen-independent region of the MHC. Using green fluorescent protein–tagged chimeras and three-dimensional video microscopy, we show that CD4 and TCR-associated CD3ζ cluster in the interface coincident with increases in intracellular calcium. Signaling-, costimulation-, and cytoskeleton-dependent processes then stabilize CD3ζ in a single cluster at the center of the interface, while CD4 moves to the periphery. Thus, the CD4 coreceptor may serve primarily to “boost” recognition of ligand by the TCR and may not be required once activation has been initiated."
https://openalex.org/W2052370877,"The photochemistry of poly[2-methoxy, 5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)- p -phenylene-vinylene] (MEH-PPV) has been found to be highly dependent on the presence of O 2 , which increases singlet exciton quenching dramatically. Spectroscopy on isolated single molecules of MEH-PPV in polycarbonate films that exclude O 2 reveals two distinct polymer conformations with fluorescence maxima near 555 and 580 nanometers wavelength, respectively. Time-resolved single-molecule data demonstrate that the 580-nanometer conformation exhibits a “landscape” for intramolecular electronic energy relaxation with a “funnel” that contains a 580-nanometer singlet exciton trap at the bottom. The exciton traps can be converted to exciton quenchers by reaction with O 2 . Conformationally induced, directed-energy transfer is arguably a critical dynamical process that is responsible for many of the distinctive photophysical properties of conjugated polymers."
https://openalex.org/W1969791922,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor that plays a major role in the DNA damage response. After DNA damage, p53 levels increase due primarily to stabilization of the protein. The molecular mechanisms leading to stabilization of p53 after DNA damage have not been completely elucidated. Recently we reported that cisplatin treatment activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and that inhibition of ERK1/2 resulted in enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin. In the present study, we examined the potential role of ERK1/2 activation in regulation of the p53 response to cisplatin. In the ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780, inhibition of ERK1/2 activation with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor PD98059 resulted in decreased p53 protein half-life and diminished accumulation of p53 protein during exposure to cisplatin. We also demonstrated that p53 protein co-immunoprecipitated with ERK1/2 protein and was phosphorylated by activated recombinant murine ERK2 in vitro. Furthermore, PD98059 decreased the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 during cisplatin exposure, suggesting that ERK1/2 mediates in part phosphorylation of p53 during the cisplatin DNA response.

In addition to its role as a transcriptional activating protein, the p53 protein also serves as a negative transcription factor, down-regulating the expression of genes such as the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 (13Miyashita T.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar).The p53 protein is normally rapidly degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, a process that is regulated primarily by binding of MDM2 protein to p53 (14Maltzman W.

MDM2 binding to the N terminus of p53 mediates the ubiquitin proteosome degradation of p53 and also regulates transactivation of p53 (15Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N . Vousden K.H.

In response to DNA damage, the amount of p53 protein is elevated primarily due to increased protein half-life (17Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which DNA damage affects p53 protein stability remains to be completely defined. However, post-translational modifications, including DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of the N terminus of p53, have been associated with regulation of p53 stability (18Shieh S-Y. Ikeda M,. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 19Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Specifically, phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 (near the MDM2 binding domain) has been shown to weaken the association between MDM2 and p53 (18Shieh S-Y. Ikeda M,. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Therefore, up-stream kinases that are involved in phosphorylation of p53 at sites near the MDM2 binding domain may participate in MDM2-dependent regulation of p53 accumulation after DNA damage.Several members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, namely DNA-activated protein kinase (20Lees-Miller S.P.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase pathways are parallel cascades of structurally related serine/threonine kinases that serve to integrate numerous extracellular signals, resulting in regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival (30Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar, 32Treisman R. Curr.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, and p38 are the terminal enzymes in three major kinase cascades within the MAP kinase family (31Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar, 32Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 35Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J.

Pincus M.R. Roni Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10541-10546Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) demonstrate that c-Jun-N-terminal kinase activation via MAP/ERK kinase kinase (MEKK1) results in p53 phosphorylation, inhibition of MDM2 association with p53, and an increase in p53 protein half-life. In addition, non-activated c-Jun-N-terminal kinase has been shown to target p53 ubiquitination and degradation in nonstressed cells (29Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Roni Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Recently, the MAP kinase p38 also was shown to phosphorylate p53 in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and to be required for UVC-induced p53-dependent transcription (26Huang C. Ma W-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 27Keller D. Zeng X. Li X. Kapoor M. Iordanov M.S. Taya Y. Lozano G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In contrast, ERK1/2 interaction with human p53 has not been previously described. Although in vitro phosphorylation of mouse p53 by activated recombinant ERK has been reported, the corresponding residues in human p53 are not conserved serine/threonine phosphorylation sites (37Milne D.M. Campbell D.G. Cudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,38Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar).We recently reported that cisplatin induces ERK1/2 activation in ovarian carcinoma cell lines (39Persons D.P. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Cui W. Pelling J.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1007-1014PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine whether the p53 response to cisplatin DNA damage was influenced by cisplatin-induced ERK1/2 activation. We demonstrated that inhibition of cisplatin-induced ERK1/2 activity by the MAP/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor PD98059 decreased p53 protein half-life and accumulation during cisplatin treatment in the ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780. Furthermore, we showed that cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 is mediated in part by ERK1/2. These results strongly suggest that ERK1/2 is one of the regulators of p53 protein accumulation and activation during the DNA damage response to cisplatin.DISCUSSIONThe p53 tumor suppressor protein is activated and stabilized in response to several cellular stresses including DNA damage (53Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). The regulation of p53 activation and stabilization after DNA damage involves protein-protein association, protein turnover, and post-translational modifications (54Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7665-7675Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Central to the regulation of p53 is the binding of MDM2 protein to p53, which results in blocking of p53-transactivating function and targeting of p53 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (14Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 15Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N . Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar, 16Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar). Several reports have linked phosphorylation of N-terminal residues of p53 protein with its activation and stability (18Shieh S-Y. Ikeda M,. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 19Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of residues near the MDM2 binding region (residues 18–23) of p53 may be a mechanism by which interaction of the two proteins is prevented.It is well established that cellular stress leads to phosphorylation of p53 at multiple sites clustered on the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of p53 (25Meek D.W. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Shieh et al. (18Shieh S-Y. Ikeda M,. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) report that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 weakens both the p53 association with MDM2 and the ability of MDM2 to inhibit the activity of p53 (18Shieh S-Y. Ikeda M,. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). However, other investigators demonstrate that phosphorylation of serine 15 has only a weak, if any, effect on MDM2 binding in vitro (55Mayo L.D. Turchi J.J. Berberich S.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5013-5015PubMed Google Scholar, 56Dumaz N. Meek D.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Therefore, the extent to which phosphorylation is required for the dissociation of the p53-MDM2 complex remains to be determined. The phosphorylation of serine 15 after DNA damage has also been shown to have a potential role in activation of p53. Phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 increases its ability to recruit CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)-binding protein (CBP)/p300, which in turn, through interaction with the N terminus of p53, increases the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of p53 (57Lambert P.F. Kashanchi F. Radonovich M.F. Shiekhattar R. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33048-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Thus, kinases that phosphorylate p53 at serine 15 after DNA damage are potentially important upstream regulators of the p53 response to DNA damage.We have demonstrated that inhibition of cisplatin-induced ERK1/2 activation decreases the level of p53 accumulation during cisplatin treatment and that the decreased accumulation is secondary to a shorter half-life of the protein. The decreased accumulation of p53 protein also resulted in decreased function of p53, as demonstrated by lower levels of the p53-dependent p21WAF-1 and MDM2 proteins after inhibition of ERK1/2 activity. These findings indicate that ERK1/2 activation is required for maximum accumulation and activation of p53 after DNA damage caused by cisplatin. However, because PD98059 does not completely inhibit accumulation of p53 protein, additional up-stream signaling pathways must also contribute the stability of p53 after cisplatin-induced DNA damage.The mechanism by which ERK1/2 activation contributes to p53 accumulation may be through its ability to phosphorylate p53 at serine 15, thereby disrupting the p53-MDM2 complex. Recently, other members of the MAP kinase family, namely c-Jun-N-terminal kinase and p38, have also been shown to phosphorylate p53 protein (31Seger R. Krebs E.G.

The p38 MAP kinase mediates UV-induced phosphorylation of p53 protein at serine 389 and has also been associated with UV-induced activation of p53 (26Huang C. Ma W-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J.

Although previous studies also demonstrate that activated recombinant ERK can phosphorylate mouse p53 in vitro at two N-terminal sites, threonine residues 73 and 83, the corresponding residues in human p53 are not conserved sites for serine/threonine phosphorylation (37Milne D.M.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Thus, our studies are the first to show that human p53 is phosphorylated by ERK1/2 after DNA damage.In addition to the recently reported involvement of p38 in phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15, three other kinases, all members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, have been reported to phosphorylate p53 at serine 15 in vitro: DNA-activated protein kinase (20Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), ATM (21Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Our observation that ERK1/2 was only partially responsible for serine 15 phosphorylation during cisplatin exposure suggested that multiple kinases were involved in this post-translational modification. To further examine this possibility, we used selective inhibitors for DNA-activated protein kinase (wortmannin), ATM (wortmannin, caffeine), ATR (caffeine), and p38 (SB202190) and determined that p53 accumulation after cisplatin treatment was also dependent on wortmannin- and caffeine-sensitive pathways. However, the relative amount of p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 compared with total p53 was not significantly altered by wortmannin or caffeine. These findings suggest that DNA-activated protein kinase, ATM, or ATR may play a role in increasing the stability of p53 protein during cisplatin exposure, but the mechanism by which this occurs appears to be independent of phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15. The inhibitor for the MAP kinase p38, SB202190, had the opposite effect on p53 accumulation, slightly enhancing the total amount of p53 protein. Similar to wortmannin and caffeine, the p38 kinase inhibitor SB202190 did not appear to affect the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 during cisplatin exposure.Our results support the hypothesis that different upstream signal transducers activate p53 in response to different forms of DNA damage. The ATM kinase has been implicated as the prime candidate for the protein kinase that phosphorylates p53 at serine 15 in response to ionizing radiation (21Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y.

Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). ATR, which phosphorylates both serine 15 and serine 37, has been shown to play a central role in the activation of p53 by UV irradiation (24Tibbetts R.S. Brunbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.-Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). In addition, both p38 and ERK1/2 have also recently been shown to have a direct role in UV-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 in mouse JB6 epidermal cells (36She Q., B. Chen N Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In our studies, the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 was the only selective inhibitor that caused a decrease in the relative level of p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 compared with total p53, suggesting that of the kinases examined in this study, only ERK1/2 contributed to serine 15 phosphorylation. Our data also suggest that a caffeine-sensitive pathway may partially inhibit serine 15 phosphorylation during cisplatin treatment, whereas wortmannin-sensitive pathways and the p38 pathway do not affect phosphorylation at serine 15.In conclusion, we have identified ERK1/2 as a protein kinase that targets p53 for phosphorylation after cisplatin-induced DNA damage. Our demonstration of the role of ERK1/2 in phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 suggests a potential mechanism by which ERK1/2 activation may augment p53 protein stability and p53 function as a transcription factor, namely through disruption of the p53-MDM2 complex. This study provides the first evidence that the ERK1/2 pathway is one of the upstream mediators of the p53 DNA damage response after exposure to cisplatin. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor that is activated in response to various types of DNA damage (1Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C.

In addition to its role as a transcriptional activating protein, the p53 protein also serves as a negative transcription factor, down-regulating the expression of genes such as the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 (13Miyashita T. Harigai M. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar). The p53 protein is normally rapidly degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, a process that is regulated primarily by binding of MDM2 protein to p53 (14Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 15Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N . Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar, 16Haupt Y.

MDM2 binding to the N terminus of p53 mediates the ubiquitin proteosome degradation of p53 and also regulates transactivation of p53 (15Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N . Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar, 16Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, the amount of p53 protein is elevated primarily due to increased protein half-life (17Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which DNA damage affects p53 protein stability remains to be completely defined. However, post-translational modifications, including DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of the N terminus of p53, have been associated with regulation of p53 stability (18Shieh S-Y. Ikeda M,. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 19Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Specifically, phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 (near the MDM2 binding domain) has been shown to weaken the association between MDM2 and p53 (18Shieh S-Y. Ikeda M,. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Therefore, up-stream kinases that are involved in phosphorylation of p53 at sites near the MDM2 binding domain may participate in MDM2-dependent regulation of p53 accumulation after DNA damage.

Here we describe the identification of such inhibitors using positional scanning amidated and acetylated syntheticl- and d-hexapeptide combinatorial libraries. The results indicated that l-Arg orl-Lys in all positions generated the most potent inhibitors. However, further investigation revealed that the peptide terminating groups hindered inhibition. Consequently, a series of non-amidated and acetylated polyarginines was synthesized. The most potent inhibitor identified, nona-l-arginine, had aK i for furin of 40 nm. TheK i values for the related convertases PACE4 and prohormone convertase-1 (PC1) were 110 nm and 2.5 μm, respectively. Although nona-l-arginine was cleaved by furin, the major products after a 6-h incubation at 37 °C were hexa- and hepta-l-arginines, both of which retained the great majority of their potency and specificity against furin. Hexa-d-arginine was as potent and specific a furin inhibitor as hexa-l-arginine (K i values of hexa-d-arginine: 106 nm, 580 nm, and 13.2 μm for furin, PACE4, and PC1, respectively). PC2 was not inhibited by any polyarginine tested; indeed, PC2 showed an increase in activity of up to 140% of the control in the presence ofl-polyarginines. Data are also presented that show extended subsite recognition by furin and PC2. Whereas N-terminal acetylation was found to reduce the inhibitory potency of thel-hexapeptide LLRVKR against furin 8-fold, C-terminal amidation reduced the potency <2-fold. Conversely, N-terminal acetylation increased the potency against PC2 nearly 3-fold, whereas C-terminal amidation of the same peptide increased the potency by a factor of 1.6.

Furin has a ubiquitous tissue distribution and cycles between thetrans-Golgi network, the cell surface, and the endosomes directed by defined sequences within the cytosolic tail (for reviews, see Refs. 4Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar and 5Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Hence, furin is well positioned to process not only intracellular growth factors and serum proteins, but also extracellular matrix proteins and cell-surface receptors. In addition to these important physiological roles, furin is implicated in the cleavage and activation of bacterial toxins and viral coat proteins, where it assists in pathological processes resulting in viral replication and toxin activation (for review, see Ref. 5Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Furin has also been implicated in assisting the maturation of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (6Maquoi E. Noel A. Frankenne F. Angliker H. Murphy G. Foidart J.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and stromelysin-3 (7Santavicca M. Noel A. Angliker H. Stoll I. Segain J.P.

Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, furin is an attractive target for therapeutic agents. Although the typical furin recognition sequence is RX(K/R)R and the minimal recognition sequence is RXXR (for review, see Ref. 5Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), there is increasing evidence that the P6, P1′, and P2′ positions also contribute to effective catalysis (9Matthews D.J. Goodman L.J.

Like furin substrates, inhibitors of furin also require the occupation of certain subsites by basic residues. The third domain of turkey ovomucoid has been engineered (KPACTLE19 → KPRCKRE19) in an attempt to increase its specificity for furin (13Lu W. Zhang W. Molloy S.S. Thomas G. Ryan K. Chiang Y. Anderson S. Laskowski Jr., M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14583-14585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the equilibrium constant of 1.1 × 107m−1 was representative of a moderate, rather than a potent, inhibitor. Inhibition of furin in the subnanomolar range was accomplished by bioengineering the reactive-site loop of an α1-antitrypsin variant, α1-PDX (α1-antitrypsin Portland), to contain the minimal furin consensus sequence (LEAIMPS359 → LERIMRS359) (14Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis shows that a portion of bound α1-PDX operates as a tight-binding suicide inhibitor, forming an SDS-stable complex with furin (15Dufour E.K. Denault J.B. Hopkins P.C. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); an alternative pathway involves cleavage and release of α1-PDX (16Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The bait region of the general protease inhibitor α2-macroglobulin was mutated (RVGFYESDVM690 → RVRSKRSLVM690) in an attempt to produce a specific furin inhibitor (17Van Rompaey L. Ayoubi T. Van De Ven W. Marynen P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although no kinetic constants were reported, processing of the endogenous furin substrates von Willebrand factor, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 glycoprotein gp160, and transforming growth factor-β1 was inhibited in COS-1 cells. More recently, the ovalbumin-type serpin human proteinase inhibitor-8, containing two instances of the minimal furin recognition sequence (VVRNSRCSRM343), has been shown to form SDS-stable complexes with furin with an overall K i of 53.8 pm (18Dahlen J.R. Jean F. Thomas G. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1851-1854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the inhibition of furin by proteinase inhibitor-8 in vivo or, indeed, the colocalization of proteinase inhibitor-8 and furin within the secretory pathway has not yet been demonstrated. Nevertheless, these studies show that potent furin inhibitors can be synthesized by appropriate protein design. The only naturally occurring intracellular furin inhibitor described to date found in the constitutive secretory pathway is furin's own propeptide. It is known that the prodomains of many proteases play a role in the activation and regulation of activity of their cognate enzymes (for review, see Ref. 19Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Anderson et al. (20Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G.

Munzer J.S. Basak A. Benjannet S. Mowla S.J. Decroly E. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol.

The potential therapeutic value of furin inhibitors was recently reinforced by a report showing that exogenous application of α1-PDX is able to block in vivo maturation of pro-gB, the human cytomegalovirus envelope glycoprotein (22Jean F.

As uptake of α1-PDX into the cell could not be detected in cell lines lacking the enzyme, it was suggested that α1-PDX bound to furin at the cell surface. Pseudomonas exotoxin A activation has also been prevented by extracellular application of α1-PDX to A7 melanoma cells (16Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl.

These studies collectively demonstrate that limited and selective inhibition of furin (potentially occurring on the extracellular surface rather than the interior of the cell) can result in inhibition of pathological disease processes. However, a furin inhibitor with the ideal characteristics of high potency, stability, and specificity, combined with low toxicity and low molecular mass, has yet to be identified. In this study, we have used positional scanning hexapeptide libraries to identify peptide inhibitors of furin, to describe the specificity requirements of effective inhibitors, and to compare the requirements of different members of the convertase family. The use of combinatorial peptide libraries, when applied to PC1, resulted in the identification of a potent hexapeptide, which was later shown to exist within the sequence of a natural protein inhibitor (23Apletalina E.

The hexapeptide libraries and synthetic peptides were synthesized at the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies (San Diego, CA). Two positional scanning hexapeptide libraries were screened for inhibition of furin, one made up of onlyl-amino acids and the other of only d-amino acids. Each hexapeptide library consisted of 120 peptide mixtures with amino-terminal acetylation and carboxyl-terminal amidation, divided into six groups corresponding to each position within the hexapeptide. For each position, 20 mixtures were surveyed, each of which was defined by 1 of the 20 natural amino acids. The undefined positions were occupied by any of the amino acids except cysteine. The positional scanning libraries and the individual compounds were synthesized using simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis methodology as described previously (26Houghten R.A. Pinilla C.

The l-polyarginine synthesis was performed by the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Core Laboratories; mass spectroscopy was used to verify identity. α1-PDX was a generous gift of G. Thomas (The Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). The anti-furin antiserum MON148 was a kind gift of W. Van de Ven (University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium). Anti-Myc and anti-His antisera were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). pERTKR-MCA was obtained from Peptides International Inc. (Louisville, KY). N-Glycosidase F was obtained from Calbiochem. The mouse furin clone was a kind gift from K. Nakayama (Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan). The mouse furin cDNA was truncated N-terminally to the transmembrane domain at His711 by polymerase chain reaction. This polymerase chain reaction product was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−)-Myc-His (Invitrogen) at theNheI and XbaI restriction sites. Dihydrofolate reductase-negative DG44 Chinese hamster ovary cells (provided by L. Chasin, Columbia University, New York, NY) were transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and colonies were selected at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in α-minimal essential medium (lacking nucleosides) containing 10% well dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Conditioned medium from colonies was screened using an enzyme assay (see below), and a high expressing clone was selected. Overexpression of furin was achieved by increasing the methotrexate concentration from 5 nm to 50 μmin 5–10-fold steps as described previously (30Lindberg I. Zhou Y. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 94-108Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Amplified lines were tested for increasing furin expression by enzyme assay. Once the 50 μm methotrexate level had been achieved, cells were split at ratios of 1:6 twice a week. 100 ml of conditioned medium (Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 100 μg/ml aprotinin (Miles Laboratories, Kankakee, IL)) was collected from confluent roller bottles every 24 h. The medium was centrifuged at low speed to remove cells, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C until required. Conditioned medium was thawed, pooled, and diluted 1:3.5 with buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 0.1% Brij 35, and 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and pumped at 40 ml/min through a Sartorius D100 anion exchange membrane. The membrane was washed with 40 ml of buffer A, followed by 40 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl and finally by 40 ml of buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl. The fraction eluting with 200 mm NaCl was diluted 1:4 with buffer A and applied to a 1-ml Mono Q HR5/5 anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Following a 10-ml wash with buffer A, elution of furin was achieved with a linear increase of 0–500 mm NaCl in buffer A over 30 ml; 2-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing peak activity were pooled, and 200-μl aliquots were subjected to gel permeation chromatography using a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and buffer A containing 200 mmNaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were assayed for activity as described below; protein content was determined following the Bradford method. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Alternatively, the enzyme-containing fraction eluting from the ion exchange membrane with 200 mm NaCl was pumped onto a 1-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (QIAGEN Inc.) at 0.3 ml/min; washed with 10 ml of buffer A; and then eluted with a two-step gradient of 0–20 mm imidazole in buffer A over 20 ml, followed by a linear gradient of 20–200 mm imidazole in buffer A. The fractions containing peak enzyme activity were pooled and subjected to ion exchange chromatography with a Mono Q column as detailed above. PC1 and PC2 were prepared by ion exchange chromatography as described previously (31Frenette G. Deperthes D. Tremblay R.R. Lazure C. Dube J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PACE4 was partially purified from the overnight conditioned medium of stably transfected HEK-293 cells (a generous gift of R. E. Mains, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) (32Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol.

Briefly, 100 ml of conditioned medium (Opti-MEM containing 100 μg/ml aprotinin) was loaded onto an Econo-Pac Q column (Bio-Rad) at 4 ml/min, washed with 10 ml of buffer A, and then eluted with a linear gradient of buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl over 50 ml. The active fractions were diluted 1:4 with buffer A prior to loading onto a Mono Q column at 1 ml/min. PACE4 was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl over 10 ml. The resulting active fractions were then pooled and stored at −80 °C until required. The validity and purity of the preparation were verified by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting with a polyclonal antiserum (1475) directed against PACE4 (a gift of R. E. Mains). The enzyme assays for PC1 and PC2 were performed at pH 5.0 using pERTKR-MCA as described previously (23Apletalina E. Appel J. Lamango N.S. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26589-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The assay for furin was performed using the same substrate at pH 7.0 in 100 mm HEPES, 5 mmCaCl2, and 0.1% Brij 35. All assays were performed at 37 °C in a 96-well fluorometer (Labsystems, Inc.) with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. The total volume was 50 μl. Unless otherwise stated, the final substrate concentration for all assays was 200 μm. When used, inhibitory peptides were preincubated with enzyme for 30 min at room temperature prior to addition of substrate. All assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Inhibition constants were determined using the method previously described (23Apletalina E. Appel J. Lamango N.S. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26589-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the equationK i = K i(app)/(1 + ([S]/K m)). The K m values for PC1, PC2, furin, and PACE4 were 11, 42, 8, and 15 μm, respectively, as determined using a computerized least-squares fitting technique with EnzFitter (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). A 200-μl aliquot of the pooled fractions from Superose chromatography (containing 40 μg of furin) was made up to 4.5% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.45% SDS and boiled for 10 min prior to concentration to 60 μl using a Centricon 10 (Amicon, Inc.). The concentrate was diluted to 400 μl using 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 0.76% Triton X-100; and 1.8 μg of N-glycosidase F was added. The sample was incubated at 37 °C, and 45-μl aliquots were removed at the times indicated and placed in 5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer prior to boiling for 3 min. The aliquots were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8.8%) and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Nona-l-arginine (200 μm) or hexa-l-arginine (200 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with or without furin (1.7 μm) in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7, containing 5 mmCaCl2 and 0.2% Brij 35. Aliquots (20 μl) were removed at the indicated times, placed into 480 μl of ice-cold 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and immediately frozen prior to HPLC. The aliquots were separated using a 5-μm Beckman ODS column (0.46 × 25 cm) with a linear gradient of 0–15% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 40 min at 1 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Cleavage products were identified using polyarginine standards. Parallel reactions containing buffer instead of furin were also analyzed. The use of the dihydrofolate reductase-coupled amplification method to overexpress truncated furin resulted in a cell line that secreted ∼0.8 μg/ml furin into the culture medium, as estimated by the specific activity of the purified protein. As shown in Table I, an initial ion exchange step, although suffering from a relatively low yield, proved valuable as a rapid method of concentrating the conditioned medium from a large volume while removing phenol red and contaminating protein from the product. Having reduced the volume, it was possible to load the high resolution Mono Q ion exchange column used in the second ion exchange step within a reasonable time frame. As shown in Fig.1 A, the majority of the protein eluted as a single peak coincident with the convertase activity. Again, the yield from this step was poor, but an appreciable increase in specific activity was observed (Table I). The fractions with maximum activity were pooled and subjected to gel permeation chromatography as shown in Fig. 1 B. In this step, virtually all the protein was seen to elute as a single peak, with only minor forms at lower and higher molecular masses; the furin activity was observed to exactly overlie the major absorbance peak. Fractions containing maximum activity were pooled, diluted with glycerol to a final concentration of 10%, and stored at −80 °C until required. Under these conditions, there was no detectable loss of activity over 6 months. Molecular mass standards used to calibrate the gel permeation column indicated a molecular mass for furin of 59 kDa. As shown in Fig.1 C, Coomassie Blue staining (left lane) and Western blotting (right lane) of the gel permeation-purified fractions revealed a single band at 61 kDa. The final specific activity was 21 units/mg of protein, and the overall yield for the purification was 27%, with a purification factor of 7.2.Table IPurification of recombinant furinPurification stepTotal activity 1-a1 unit = 1 μmol of aminomethylcoumarin/h.Total proteinSpecific activityYieldPurification factorunitsmgunits/mg%Conditioned medium156542.9(100)(1)Ion exchange 1847.611543.8Ion exchange 2462.419296.7Gel permeation42221277.21-a 1 unit = 1 μmol of aminomethylcoumarin/h. Open table in a new tab Initial purifications were attempted using the C-terminally located hexa-His tag as a ligand for affinity chromatography with a metal ion chelation resin (Ni NTA Superflow, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). However, the furin activity was found to elute at very low (≈20 mm) imidazole concentrations, with no increase in specific activity compared with the sample applied. Subsequent Western blotting with both anti-His and anti-Myc antisera showed no immunoreactivity, whereas blotting using the anti-furin antiserum MON148 revealed a strong band at 61 kDa (Fig. 1 C, right lane), indicating that C-terminal truncation of the secreted product had occurred. The metal ion chelation step was subsequently abandoned, and the data presented in this report were obtained using furin purified by ion exchange and gel permeation chromatography as detailed in TableI. Treatment of the purified furin with N-glycosidase F revealed the presence of two lower molecular mass forms, indicating that two of the three potential sites in the recombinant furin preparation were present and originally glycosylated (Fig.1 D). The effect of pH on activity was studied. Although there was a rapid drop in activity below pH 6.5, the enzyme retained >90% of maximum activity at pH 9.0 (data not shown). Calcium concentrations over 1 mm were required for full activity, with no significant difference in activity as calcium concentrations were increased to 50 mm. In accordance with previous results (16Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), furin was potently inhibited at nanomolar α1-PDX concentrations, providing further validation of the enzyme preparation (data not shown). In an attempt to identify residues important for inhibition of furin, we screened a positional scanning l-hexapeptide library (amino-terminally acetylated and carboxyl-terminally amidated) using the substrate pERTKR-MCA. In total, the library was screened nine times at inhibitor concentrations of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/ml and at substrate concentrations of 200 and 100 μm. The concentrations of inhibitor and substrate were found to exert an influence on the relative inhibition observed. Screening at the lower substrate concentration resulted in better discrimination between residues at all inhibitor concentrations. In addition, at the lower substrate concentration, better discrimination was shown for positions P1, P2, and P3 at 1 mg/ml inhibitor (Fig. 2 A), whereas better discrimination for positions P4, P5, and P6 was seen at 0.5 mg/ml inhibitor (Fig. 2 B). From Fig. 2 A (using an inhibitor concentration of 1 mg/ml), it can be seen that at position P1, Arg, Lys, and His exerted greater than average inhibition, whereas at positions P2 and P3, Arg and Lys, but not His, were the preferred residues. At positions P4 and P5 and especially position P6, many residues showed greater than average inhibition, but no clear distinction could be made on the basis of size, hydrophobicity, or charge. In contrast, at the lower inhibitor concentration (Fig. 2 B), although there were no clearly preferred residues at positions P1, P2, and P3, there was good discrimination at positions P4, P5, and P6. On the basis of the screens shown in Fig. 4, we selected Arg in positions P1, P2, and P3; Lys in position P4; His or Arg in position P5; and His, Met, Lys, or Arg in position P6 for assembly into discrete peptide sequences. The positional scanning acetylated and amidated d-hexapeptide library was screened a total of nine times at either 0.5 or 1.0 mg/ml inhibitor and either 50 or 100 μm substrate; in all cases, the results were similar. A representative screen is shown in Fig.3. Whereas d-Arg was one of the preferred residues in all positions, the remainder of the inhibitory residues were hydrophobic. Interestingly, d-Lys effected greater than average inhibition only in position P6, but still showed less inhibition than the most effective residue,d-Trp. In positions P3, P4, and P5, d-Arg was marginally the most potent residue when all results were averaged. In position P2, d-Arg and d-Ile consistently produced relatively high inhibition, whereas the same was true ford-Arg and d-Leu in position P1. In all cases, relative inhibition values were consistently lower than those of thel-hexapeptide library, indicating a preference of furin forl-residues. Nevertheless, a series ofd-hexapeptides was synthesized based upon the results described above, whereby position P1 was either d-Arg ord-Leu; position P2 was either d-Arg ord-Ile; positions P3, P4, and P5 were alwaysd-Arg; and position P6 was always d-Trp. The amidated and acetylated d- and l-hexapeptides based on the results of the d- andl-hexapeptide library scre"

We have found that chemical inhibitors of metalloproteases potentiate netrin-mediated axon outgrowth in vitro. We have also found that DCC is a substrate for metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding, and that the inhibitors block proteolytic processing of DCC and cause an increase in DCC protein levels on axons within spinal cord explants. Thus, potentiation of netrin activity by inhibitors may result from stabilization of DCC on the axons, and proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration by controlling the number of functional extracellular axon guidance receptors."

Genetic studies on fungal melanin biosynthesis in M. griseayielded three classes of melanin-deficient mutants based on pigmentation phenotypes (25Chumley F.G. Valent B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1990; 3: 135-143Crossref Google Scholar). Instead of the black polymer of fungal melanin, Buf− mutants lacking catalytic activity for 3HNR produce buff-colored pigment, and Rsy− mutants lacking catalytic activity for SD produce rosy-colored pigment. Accumulated pigments in the mutants result from the oxidation products of the respective precursors of the enzyme in the pathway, 3HN in the Buf− mutants, and 4HN in the Rsy− mutants. Since the Buf− mutant accumulates oxidation products of 3HN, it is obvious when considering the procession of the pathway (Fig.1) that there should be another biochemical route to produce 3HN from 4HN without using 3HNR as the catalyst. Another indication of a second reductase is that the fungicides used for preventing rice blast (tricyclazole, pyroquilon, and phthalide) are known to cause the accumulation of 3HN byproducts in fungal cultures (1Tokousbalides M.C. Sisler H.D. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1978; 8: 26-32Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Woloshuk C.P. Wolkow P.M. Sisler H.D. Pestic.

A more quantitative assessment of the situation is obtained from measuring the accumulation in the media of scytalone, which is considerably more stable than 3HN or 4HN (Table I). The wild-type and the Buf− mutant do not accumulate scytalone in their growth media, whereas the Rsy− mutant does. Crosses between the Buf− and Rsy− mutants yield double mutants that accumulate scytalone in their growth medium to about half the extent as the Rsy− mutant. These results also suggest that there is either another reductase responsible for catalyzing the reduction of 4HN to scytalone or there is another route altogether for producing scytalone in M. grisea. In this work we report that, indeed, there is another reductase in the pathway and that its presence in M. grisea fully accounts for the accumulation of scytalone in the double mutant (buf − rsy −) described above. Additionally, we report that the new reductase is considerably more specific for 4HN over 3HN in comparison to 3HNR. Historically, the enzyme we denote as 3HNR (2Thompson J.E. Basarab G.S.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses of proteins were conducted by using a PhastSystem (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Homogeneous 3HNR was purified as described (30Andersson A. Jordan D.

The molecular mass of 4HNR was determined using a Fisons VG Quattro II mass spectrometer with calibration against horse heart myoglobin as an external standard.M. grisea and its mutants were grown in liquid media as described (25Chumley F.G. Valent B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1990; 3: 135-143Crossref Google Scholar), and the scytalone concentrations in the media were determined by using scytalone dehydratase in an end point spectrophotometric determination (13Basarab G.S.

A λZipLox (Life Technologies, Inc.) library containing cDNA from M. grisea strain 6043 (31Sweigard J.A. Carroll A.M. Farrall L. Chumley F.G. Valent B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) was probed with radiolabeled 3HNR cDNA, and a class of weakly hybridizing clones was isolated in addition to the homologous3HNR clones. 2B. Valent and L. Farrall, manuscript in preparation. Sequencing of the weakly hybridizing cDNAs confirmed identification of a putative second reductase (HNR) gene. GenomicHNR clones were identified from a phage genomic excision library (31Sweigard J.A. Carroll A.M. Farrall L. Chumley F.G. Valent B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) containing DNA from strain 4091-5-8 in the λFIXBAR vector. A full-length cDNA coding sequence (pCB1346) was assembled into vector pTrc99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using polymerase chain reaction according to standard methods (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Clonging: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For expression in Escherichia coli, the 4HNR-coding sequence of pCB1346 was transferred as an NcoI-BamHI fragment into the vector pET-11d (Novagen), forming plasmid pFA127, where 4HNR expression is driven by a lac-controlled phage T7 promoter system. Expression levels in E. coli BL21(DE3) were unexpectedly low as a consequence of mRNA secondary structure formed by complementarity between the initial coding sequence and the upstream ribosome binding sequence provided by the vector. To circumvent this limitation without altering the 4HNR amino acid sequence, we employed a “ribosome delivery” strategy modeled after several natural systems in which translation of adjacent cistrons is coupled (33Schoner B.E. Belagaje R.M. Schoner R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We provided as a ribosome feeder upstream from the 4HNR initiation codon a highly translated mini-cistron (17 codons) derived from the N-terminal fragment of T7 gene 10 (Fig.2). This vector (pFA156) was constructed by inserting a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide with the overlapping translational stop and restart signals into pET21c(+) (Novagen) in place of the multiple cloning site sequences (betweenBamHI and XhoI sites). The 4HNR coding sequence was inserted into pFA156 as an NcoI-ScaI fragment from pFA127 to form the expression plasmid pFA168. The 4HNR coding sequence in pFA168 (and pCB1346) was found to carry a sequence alteration, presumably introduced during polymerase chain reaction cloning, resulting in a substitution of Leu (CTC) for the natural Phe (TTC), found in the genomic clone, at position 135. This mutation was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The entire coding sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the corrected pFA168 were grown to mid-log phase, induced 4 h with 1 mm 1-(isopropylthio)-β-d-galactopyranoside, harvested, resuspended in 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, and lysed by sonication. Protein purification steps were at 0–4 °C. After centrifugation, the cleared lysate was brought to 25% of saturation with respect to (NH4)2SO4 and centrifuged. The supernatant was subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a phenyl-Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 25% of saturation (NH4)2SO4. The column was developed with a linear gradient of equilibration buffer to equilibration buffer lacking (NH4)2SO4. Fractions containing 4HNR were dialyzed exhaustively against 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5. The protein was subjected to anion exchange chromatography (Mono-Q, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a linear gradient (0 to 0.5m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) to obtain homogeneous 4HNR. 4HNR subunit concentrations were estimated using a calculated ε280 value of 23,830m−1cm−1. Wild-type strain 4091-5-8, the Rsy −mutant CP485, and the Buf− mutant CP61 were described previously (25Chumley F.G. Valent B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1990; 3: 135-143Crossref Google Scholar). Preparation of the remaining strains will be described in detail elsewhere.2 Briefly, the buf − rsy − double mutants 4442−4-3 and 4442-4-6 represent both pairs of double recombinant progeny from an nonparental ditype tetrad isolated from a genetic cross between Buf− mutant CP2833 and a Rsy− strain derived from CP485. The Buf−mutants CP2831 and CP2833 were constructed by gene disruption techniques to ensure a total the absence of 3HNR enzyme activity for these studies. Specifically, the internal 3HNR gene sequence encoding amino acids 39–253 was replaced by the BAR gene, which confers bialaphos resistance to these mutants. A gene replacement vector for the 4HNR gene was produced by inserting theHPH gene, conferring hygromycin resistance, into an internalNotI site in the 4HNR coding sequence, and this vector was used to disrupt the 4HNR locus by homologous recombination. This 4HNR disruption vector was transformed into strain 4091-5-8 to produce the hnr − strain CP3097 and into the buf − rsy − double mutant 4442-4-3 to produce triple mutants CP3100, CP3101, and CP3102. The buf − hnr − double mutant was obtained from tetrad analysis of a cross between the hnr− gene disruption strain CP3097 and buf− strain CP61. Reactions (1 ml) with varying concentrations of DDBO, scytalone, or vermelone contained 1 mm NADP+ in 50 mm MES, 25 mm Tris, 25 mmethanolamine, and 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. Initial rates were measured spectrophotometrically after initiating reactions with enzyme. The following net extinction coefficients combining the oxidation of the varied substrates with the reduction of NADP+ (all in units of mm−1cm−1) were used: DDBO, Δε340 = 5.4; scytalone, Δε355 = 9.38; vermelone, Δε340 = 14.1. Reactions (1 ml) with PQ contained 200 μm NADPH in 100 mm MOPS-NaOH and 1% Me2SO at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. Reactions were initiated with PQ. Initial rates were monitored spectrophotometrically using Δε340 = -6.2 mm−1cm−1 (reduced PQ autooxidizes back to PQ rapidly relative to the time of the assay and does not contribute to the change in absorbance). Initial rate data were fitted to Equation 1using Kinetasyst (IntelleKinetics) or Grafit 4.0 (Erithacus Software); ν is the observed velocity, k cat is the maximum velocity per enzyme protomer, K m is the Michaelis constant, and S is the varied substrate concentration. Relative substrate specificities for scytalone and vermelone, φscytalonevermelone, were calculated through Equation 2 using the parameters determined with Equation 1; (k cat/K m)vermeloneis the specificity constant of the enzyme for vermelone, and (k cat/K m)scytaloneis the specificity constant of the enzyme for scytalone. Inhibition constants were determined in PQ reactions (60 s) that contained 2.5, 5.0, or 20 μm PQ, and rate data were fitted to Equation3, where I and K i are the inhibitor concentration and the dissociation constant for the inhibitor from the ternary complex (enzyme-NADPH-inhibitor), respectively. Inhibitor concentrations exceeded enzyme concentrations in the incubations by at least 4-fold. ν=kcatSS+KmEquation 1 Φscytalonevermelone=(kcat/Km) vermelone(kcat/Km) scytaloneEquation 2 ν=kcatSS+Km(1+I/Ki)Equation 3 A multiwavelength spectrophotometric method (34Thompson J.E. Jordan D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was used to determine the partitioning of vermelone and scytalone to their respective oxidized (naphthol) products in incubations that contained both substrates. Reactions (1 ml) having different molar ratios of scytalone and vermelone contained 50 μm NADP+ in 50 mm MES, 25 mm Tris, 25 mm ethanolamine, and 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. Initial rates were measured spectrophotometrically after initiating reactions with 3HNR or 4HNR. Net extinction coefficient changes for scytalone oxidation and NADP+ reduction (in units of mm−1cm−1) were Δε244 = 5.7; Δε282 = −4.8; Δε294 = −1.84; Δε310 = −0.78; Δε348 = 11.3. Net extinction coefficient changes on vermelone oxidation and NADP+ reduction (in units of mm−1cm−1) were Δε244 = 3.87; Δε282 = 2.11; Δε294 = 5.24; Δε310 = 9.4; Δε348 = 12.24. Partition ratios (νvermelone/νscytalone of Equation4) were determined by non-linear least squares fittings of initial rate data using by the computer program RS1 (BBN Research Systems, Cambridge, MA) as described (34Thompson J.E. Jordan D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); νvermelone is the rate of vermelone oxidation; νscytalone is the rate of scytalone oxidation; [vermelone] is the concentration of vermelone, and [scytalone] is the concentration of scytalone. Transformation of Equation 4 to Equation 5 defines φscytalonevermelone as the relative specificity of an enzyme for substrate vermelone in comparison to scytalone. The relative specificity of 3HNR and 4HNR for 3HN over 4HN was calculated through Equation 6; φ4HN3HN is the relative specificity of an enzyme for 3HN over 4HN, K eq(scytalone, 4HN) is the equilibrium constant ([scytalone][NADP+]/[4HN][NADPH][H+]), and K eq(vermelone, 3HN) is the equilibrium constant ([vermelone][NADP+]/[3HN][NADPH][H+]). Equilibrium constants were determined in 100 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. K eq(scytalone, 4HN) determinations were in 1-ml reactions containing 70 μm scytalone and 29, 58, 116, or 290 μmNADP+. Reactions were initiated with 3HNR (80 μg in 2 μl) and monitored until the absorbance at 348 nm was constant. A net extinction coefficient for products minus reactants (Δε348 = 11.3 mm−1cm−1) was used in calculating the equilibrium concentrations. K eq(vermelone, 3HN) determinations were in 1-ml reactions containing 106 μmvermelone and 29, 58, or 116 μm NADP+. Reactions were initiated with 3HNR (80 μg in 2 μl) and monitored until the absorbance at 348 nm was constant. A net extinction coefficient for products minus reactants (Δε348 = 12.2 mm−1cm−1) was used in calculating the equilibrium concentrations.νvermeloneνscytalone=(kcat/Km) vermelone [vermelone](kcat/Km) scytalone [scytalone]Equation 4 Φscytalonevermelone=νvermelone [scytalone]νscytalone [vermelone]=(kcat/Km) vermelone(kcat/Km) scytaloneEquation 5 Φ4HN3HN=Φscytalonevermelone×Keq(vermelone,3HN)Keq(scytalone,4HN)Equation 6 The putative second reductase gene was identified as an M. grisea gene with weak homology to the 3HNR gene. Mutants were produced by gene disruption techniques for phenotypic analysis. Hnr− mutants have similar pigmentation properties as the wild-type strains. However,hnr − buf − double mutants were found to develop a cherry red pigment in their growth medium, a pigmentation phenotype that resembles that of the Rsy− mutants and reflects the accumulation of oxidation products of 4HN. Whereas double mutants (buf − rsy −) lacking SD and 3HNR functions accumulate significant quantities of scytalone in their growth media, triple mutants (buf − rsy − hnr −) do not (TableI). The triple mutants develop red pigmentation similar to the buf − hnr − double mutants. It is concluded that the second reductase gene encodes for a 4HNR capable of catalyzing the reduction of 4HN to scytalone and that the activity of this 4HNR fully accounts for the conversion of 4HN to scytalone in the buf− and buf − rsy − mutants. The 4HNRgene product was produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The predicted molecular mass of the product of the coding sequence is 28,637.5 Da. The molecular mass of the purified protein determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is 28,436 Da. The protein was found to have the N-terminal sequence Pro-Ser-Ala-Asp lacking the N-terminal Met and Ala residues of the primary translation product, presumably as a consequence of the processing activity of methionine aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase P in E. coli(35Yasueda H. Kikuchi Y. Kojima H. Nagase K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1991; 36: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass of the aminopeptidase-processed protein is 28,435.2, in good agreement with the mass spectroscopy results. A sequence alignment of 4HNR with 3HNR proteins indicates that the two proteins are 46% identical (Fig.3). Based on the x-ray structure of the 3HNR-NADPH-tricyclazole complex (5Andersson A. Jordan D. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Structure ( Lond. ). 1996; 4: 1161-1170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), there are nine amino acid side chains within a 4-Å sphere around the inhibitor, which occupies the naphthol binding site in 3HNR: Ser-164, Ile-165, Tyr-178, Met-215, Tyr-216, Cys-220, Tyr-223, Trp-243, and Met-283. Five of these residues are conserved in 4HNR. Tyr-216 is changed to Phe, Cys-220 is changed to Ser, Trp-243 is changed to Met, and Met-283 is missing in 4HNR (Fig.3). The catalytic triad of 3HNR (Ser-164, Tyr-178, and Lys-182) is conserved in 4HNR. Steady-state kinetic parameters for substrates scytalone and vermelone were determined for 4HNR and 3HNR under the same conditions at pH 7.0 and 25 °C (TableII). The individual determinations of substrate specificities for vermelone [k cat/K m(vermelone)] and scytalone [k cat/K m(scytalone)] suggest that the discrimination between the two enzymes is small and slightly favors the wrong selectivity according to our designations of the two enzymes based on the phenotypes of the M. griseamutants. However, it is known that there are strong contributions from substrate inhibition in the determined values despite our efforts to diminish such effects, 3J. Thompson and D. Jordan, unpublished results. and on this basis we must discount the specificity ratios. In the effort to determine true values for the relative substrate specificities, we employed a direct method for measuring substrate competition (34Thompson J.E. Jordan D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this procedure the dehydrogenation rates for vermelone and scytalone are determined simultaneously in a single incubation for the individual enzymes, 3HNR and 4HNR. From the values reported in Table II using this method, 3HNR prefers vermelone over scytalone by a factor of 39; 4HNR has the opposite preference by a factor of 33. Equilibrium constants were determined spectrophotometrically at pH 7.0 and 25 °C:K eq(scytalone, 4HN) = [scytalone][NADP+]/([4HN][NADPH][H+] = 3.0 ± 0.5 × 107 andK eq(vermelone, 3HN) = [vermelone][NADP+]/([3HN][NADPH][H+] = 0.32 ± 0.04 × 107. They were used to calculate (Equation 6) the relative preferences for 3HN and 4HN; 3HNR prefers 3HN over 4HN by a factor of 4.2, and 4HNR prefers 4HN over 3HN by a factor of 310. Note that DDBO (Fig. 1), which more closely resembles vermelone than scytalone, is a much better substrate for 3HNR than 4HNR, whereas PQ (Fig. 1), which does not closely resemble either vermelone or scytalone, is accepted by 3HNR and 4HNR with similar substrate specificities.Table IISteady-state k"
https://openalex.org/W2034602137,"Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by both remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and hypertrophic growth of the cardiocytes. Here we show increased expression and cytoskeletal association of the ECM proteins fibronectin and vitronectin in pressure-overloaded feline myocardium. These changes are accompanied by cytoskeletal binding and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr-397 and Tyr-925, c-Src at Tyr-416, recruitment of the adapter proteins p130Cas, Shc, and Nck, and activation of the extracellular-regulated kinases ERK1/2. A synthetic peptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif of fibronectin and vitronectin was used to stimulate adult feline cardiomyocytes cultured on laminin or within a type-I collagen matrix. Whereas cardiocytes under both conditions showed RGD-stimulated ERK1/2 activation, only collagen-embedded cells exhibited cytoskeletal assembly of FAK, c-Src, Nck, and Shc. In RGD-stimulated collagen-embedded cells, FAK was phosphorylated only at Tyr-397 and c-Src association occurred without Tyr-416 phosphorylation and p130Cas association. Therefore, c-Src activation is not required for its cytoskeletal binding but may be important for additional phosphorylation of FAK. Overall, our study suggests that multiple signaling pathways originate in pressure-overloaded heart following integrin engagement with ECM proteins, including focal complex formation and ERK1/2 activation, and many of these pathways can be activated in cardiomyocytes via RGD-stimulated integrin activation.

This hypertrophy occurs in response to an increased mechanical (hemodynamic) load on the heart in the form of pressure or volume overload, which is characteristic of hypertension and valvular defects, or to a decrease in functional heart tissue as seen in myocardial infarction. The initial hypertrophic response of the heart is compensatory but frequently deteriorates into heart failure and increased morbidity/mortality (1Francis G.S. Chu C. Curr. Opin.

This transition from compensation to failure occurs when further hypertrophy of the heart cannot normalize wall stress and maintain contractile function in the face of its hemodynamic load. Although mechanical load appears to directly regulate mass and associated phenotypic changes at the level of the cardiocyte (for a review see Ref. 3Cooper G. Annu. Rev.

In an effort to better understand the signaling events triggered by pressure overloading of the myocardium, we used a model where the right ventricle of adult cats was pressure-overloaded, and the normally loaded left ventricle was used as an internal control (12Rozich J.D. Barnes M.A. Schmid P.G. Zile M.R. McDermott P.J. Cooper G. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1995; 27: 485-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Cooper G. Satava R. Harrison C. Coleman H. Circ. Res. 1973; 33: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hypertrophy develops in this model as early as 48 h accompanied by a deterioration of the contractile function, which is partially because of cytoskeletal reorganization particularly of the microtubular fraction (14Tsutsui H. Ishihara K. Cooper G. Science. 1993; 260: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In 48-h pressure-overloaded myocardium, we have described cytoskeletal association and activation of signaling proteins including c-Src and FAK, and these events were accompanied by changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytoskeletal proteins (15Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, we identified an initial signaling event resulting in the activation of several Ser/Thr protein kinases, including protein kinase C, c-Raf, and p70/85 S6 kinase in 1–4-h pressure-overloaded myocardium (10Laser M. Kasi V.S. Hamawaki M. Cooper G. Kerr C.M. Kuppuswamy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24610-24619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This early signaling (1–4-h pressure overload), comprised primarily of Ser/Thr kinases, and the delayed signaling (48-h pressure overload), comprised of integrin-mediated cytoskeletal assembly and activation of tyrosine kinases, were accompanied, respectively, by the induction of immediate early genes (IEGs), such as egr-1 and c-fos, and atrial natriuretic factors (12Rozich J.D. Barnes M.A. Schmid P.G. Zile M.R. McDermott P.J. Cooper G. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1995; 27: 485-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because we observe at least two waves of signaling in the hypertrophying heart (16Laser M. Nagai T. Kasi V.S. Baicu C.F. Willey C.D. Kerr C.M. Zile M.R. Cooper G. Kuppuswamy D. Takeda N. Nagano M. Dhalla N.S. The Hypertrophied Heart. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston2000: 143-164Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that the transcriptional products of IEGs generated during the early wave of signaling might contribute to the second wave of integrin-dependent signaling. To test this, we focused on extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (VN) because they are often shown to be products of IEGs (17Blatti S.P. Foster D.N. Ranganathan G. Moses H.L. Getz M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Ryseck R.P. MacDonald-Bravo H. Zerial M. Bravo R. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both ECM proteins are known to preferably interact with α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins (19Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 20Felding-Habermann B. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), respectively, and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (21Giancotti F.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these ECM proteins have been shown to be up-regulated in the adult heart during pressure overload, myocardial infarction, and spontaneous hypertension (22Farhadian F. Contard F. Sabri A. Samuel J.L. Rappaport L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 433-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, changes in physical stress and strain on the myocardium can alter the ECM composition, thereby initiating a signaling cascade via the assembly and activation of integrins on the cardiocyte surface. Such a signaling pathway may contribute either independently or cohesively with other signaling events to the overall hypertrophic growth and/or phenotypic changes. Studies on FN fibrillogenesis have shown that soluble FN dimers bind to integrins, which in turn cluster, activate, and self-assemble into detergent-insoluble fibrils over a period of several hours (23Schwarzbauer J.E. Sechler J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 24Sechler J.L. Corbett S.A. Schwarzbauer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2563-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show both FN and VN secretion as well as assembly of signaling proteins in 48-h pressure-overloaded myocardium. To understand both the mechanism and role of this assembly, we developed a cell culture model in which cardiocytes were embedded three-dimensionally in a type-I collagen matrix and stimulated with a synthetic peptide containing the integrin-binding motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) of FN and VN. These studies show that integrin engagement and FAK activation are responsible for recruitment of c-Src and adapter proteins to the cytoskeleton and that the assembly of many of these signaling proteins can occur in the absence of c-Src activation. Furthermore, our studies also demonstrate that the interaction of integrins with ECM proteins results in the activation of ERK1/2 and that this activation can occur even in the absence of cytoskeletal assembly and activation of FAK and c-Src. Adult cats weighing 2.8–3.5 kg were used for right ventricular pressure-overload (RVPO) by partial occlusion of the pulmonary artery, as we described previously (12Rozich J.D. Barnes M.A. Schmid P.G. Zile M.R. McDermott P.J. Cooper G. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1995; 27: 485-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Cooper G. Satava R. Harrison C. Coleman H. Circ. Res. 1973; 33: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, cats underwent partial pulmonary artery occlusion by either external banding (48 h and longer) or insertion of a balloon catheter (1–4 h). Systemic arterial pressure remained the same whereas the pulmonary arterial pressure at least doubled. Control cats were sham-operated by thoracotomy and pericardiotomy without arterial occlusion. Additionally, the left ventricles (LV) from each group served as internal controls for pressure-overloaded right ventricles (RV). Adult feline cardiocytes were isolated from normal cats and cultured on laminin (two-dimensional model) as described previously (25Mann D.L. Urabe Y. Kent R.L. Vinciguerra S. Cooper G. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For embedding cardiocytes three dimensionally in type-I collagen (collagen-embedded model), freshly isolated cells (2.5 × 105) were suspended in M199 cell culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Cells were mixed with soluble type-I collagen (Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA) at room temperature in a final volume of 5 ml/well in 4-well plastic dishes at a final concentration of 0.1%. The cell-collagen mixture was allowed to polymerize at 37 °C for 10 min, then covered with 1 ml of medium (M199) and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For experiments using RGD/RGE peptides (Sigma), stock solutions of RGD (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser) or RGE (Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser) were prepared in M199, adjusted to pH 7.4, and added (final concentration as indicated in the figure legends) either directly to the cells cultured on laminin (two-dimensional model) or mixed into the collagen-cell mixture before polymerization (collagen-embedded model). To recover cardiocytes from the collagen-embedded model, the collagen gel from each well was digested with 15 ml of collagenase-D solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH, Germany), prepared at 4 mg/ml in Krebs solution, by incubating for 10–15 min in a 37 °C water bath. The cells were then washed twice with Krebs solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, once with phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted for subcellular fractionation. In the case of the two-dimensional model, cells were harvested in 1 ml of ice cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation for subsequent subcellular fractionation (see below). Pelleted cells (2 × 105) or 50 mg of ventricular tissue were homogenized in 0.5 ml or 2 ml, respectively, of ice cold Triton X-100 extraction buffer, which contained in final concentrations 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μm E-64 [trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane], and 200 μg/ml p-aminobenzamidine, 1 μmokadaic acid, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Both Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble components were prepared as we have described previously (15Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. After the initial homogenization and centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was preserved as the detergent-soluble fraction (soluble). The pellet (insoluble) was reextracted with extraction buffer to remove any remaining detergent-soluble proteins, pelleted, resuspended, and boiled in 0.25 or 0.5 volumes of the homogenization buffer with 1× SDS sample buffer for tissue or pelleted cells, respectively. To the detergent-soluble fraction, an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer was added and boiled. 20-μl samples in SDS sample buffer were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). The membranes were blocked for 1 h using 10% milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Blots were incubated with the primary antibodies in TBST buffer overnight at 4 °C with light agitation. The following primary antibodies were obtained from commercial sources: monoclonal antibody for c-Src (catalog no. 05-184) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); monoclonal antibodies for FAK (catalog no. F15020), Shc (catalog no. S68020), Nck (catalog no. N15920), paxillin (catalog no. P13520) and β3-integrin (catalog no. I19620) were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal antibody for actin (catalog no. MAB1501) and polyclonal antibody for fibronectin (catalog no. AB1941) were from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA); phosphospecific polyclonal antibodies for FAK (catalog nos. 44-624, 44-616) and c-Src (catalog no. 44-660) were fromBiosource International (Camarillo, CA); polyclonal antibodies for MAPK (catalog no. V1141) and phospho-MAPK (catalog no. V8031) were from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI); polyclonal antibody for p130Cas (catalog no. S-859) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal anti-vitronectin antibody (catalog no. 12069-019) was from Life Technologies, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal anti-β1D antibody was generated as described previously (26Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N.I. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Following the incubation with the primary antibodies, blots were washed five times for 5 min each with TBST buffer and then incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in TBST buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Following five washes of 5 min duration each with TBST, the proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products). For Western blot detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, the blots were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C and probed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories, catalog no. P11625) for 30 min at 37 °C. Washing and detection conditions were the same as described above. In a recent study (15Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we showed cytoskeletal assembly and activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases c-Src and FAK in 48-h pressure-overloaded heart, and these events were accompanied by the cytoskeletal assembly of β3-integrin. Therefore, our initial focus was to determine whether a change in the composition and/or expression of the ECM occurs during pressure overload-induced hypertrophy. To explore this possibility, ventricular tissue samples from control and RVPO cats were used to prepare detergent-lysed subfractions as we have described previously (15Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These fractions, namely, Triton X-100-soluble, and Triton X-100-insoluble fractions (cytoskeleton, csk), were used to detect the level of various ECM proteins including laminin, collagen I, collagen IV, entactin, tenascin, osteopontin, fibronectin, and vitronectin. Among these ECM proteins, fibronectin and vitronectin, which were not present in significant levels in both normal and 4-h pressure-overloaded myocardium (Fig. 1), showed a substantial increase in the cytoskeletal fractions of 48-h pressure-overloaded RV, and this increase persisted even in 1-week pressure-overloaded heart. The secretion and assembly of these two ECM proteins in 48-h RVPO myocardium matches that of our previous observation on the cytoskeletal assembly and activation of FAK and c-Src (15Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction often consists of an integrin-mediated focal adhesion complex which might potentially contribute to the hypertrophic remodeling, we examined this fraction for the presence of signaling proteins that have been shown to associate with the cytoskeleton following agonist stimulation. Screening of several candidate molecules in the cytoskeleton resulted in the detection of adapter proteins p130Cas, Nck, and Shc along with non-receptor tyrosine kinases FAK and c-Src only in pressure-overloaded RV but not in normally loaded LV (Fig. 2 A). The assembly of these proteins was accompanied by a substantial increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytoskeleton-bound proteins with molecular sizes of 55–60, 69, and 120–130 kDa, when compared with the normally loaded left ventricle (Fig. 2 B). Such changes were not observed in sham-operated control cat ventricles (LV or RV) (data not shown). Based on the Western blot analysis with specific antibodies, the positions of p130Cas, FAK, and c-Src are indicated in the phosphotyrosine blot. Although p130Cas (Fig. 2 A), which is recognized by the polyclonal anti-p130Cas antibody, demonstrated a shift to the cytoskeleton, this protein band migrated as a 110-kDa protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A band corresponding to the size of this protein was also found to be tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig. 2 B). To demonstrate the presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK and c-Src in the 110–130-kDa and 55–60-kDa protein bands, respectively, of the cytoskeletal fraction of pressure-overloaded myocardium, we employed phosphospecific antibodies. Previous studies show that the phosphorylation of FAK at the Tyr-397 site creates a binding site for c-Src (27Schaller M. Hildebrand J. Shannon J. Fox J. Vines R. Parsons J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 28Xing Z. Chen H.C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Guan J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Furthermore, once a complex is formed with FAK, c-Src becomes active and phosphorylates additional sites of FAK including the Tyr-925, which is critical for the recruitment of p130Cas(29Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5501-5509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used phosphospecific antibodies to analyze whether these specific sites of cytoskeleton-bound FAK as well as c-Src are phosphorylated in response to pressure overload. Analyses of the cytoskeletal fractions showed phosphorylation of FAK at the Tyr-397 and Tyr-925 sites and of c-Src at the Tyr-416 site (Fig. 2 C) indicating the presence of an activated focal adhesion complex in the cytoskeletal fraction of pressure-overloaded myocardium. Finally, we employed phosphorylation site-specific paxillin antibody to determine whether the 69-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in the pressure-overloaded myocardium (Fig. 2) is paxillin. Such analysis showed no detectable level of phosphorylated paxillin either in the detergent-soluble or -insoluble (cytoskeletal) fractions (data not shown). Furthermore, Western blot analysis using non-selective anti-paxillin antibody showed paxillin distribution both in the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions of normally loaded ventricles and did not show any change in the distribution during pressure overload (data not shown). Both FN and VN showed increased levels as well as assembly to the cytoskeletal fraction of pressure-overloaded myocardium (Fig. 1), and they are known to interact preferably with α5β1 and αvβ3integrin isoforms, respectively (for a review see Ref. 30Green L.J. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed whether the cytoskeletal binding of these ECM proteins is accompanied by the association of these integrins to the cytoskeleton. As we showed previously (15Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), β3 integrin was found to be present in the cytoskeletal complex of pressure-overloaded myocardium (Fig.2 A). However, the β1D integrin isoform (muscle cell-specific isoform of β1 integrin), which was present in substantial amounts in the soluble fraction of adult heart, did not demonstrate a significant shift to the cytoskeleton with pressure overload (data not shown). To determine the importance of the cytoskeletal assembly of signaling proteins in mediating downstream signaling, we examined two different models for adult cardiocyte cultures: (i) a two-dimensional model in which adult cardiocytes were cultured on laminin-coated plates, and (ii) a three-dimensional model in which cardiocytes were embedded in type-I collagen gel (31Nagai T. Laser M. Baicu C.F. Zile M.R. Cooper G. Kuppuswamy D. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 83: 38H-43HAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because in in vivopressure-overloaded heart cytoskeletal assembly of signaling proteins was accompanied by the secretion and binding of FN and VN, we used these ECM proteins in our initial experiments to study integrin-mediated signaling. Treatment of cardiocytes either cultured on laminin or in the collagen gel with FN or VN for 1 h (final concentrations at 0.5 mg/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively) did not result in cytoskeletal assembly of any of the signaling proteins (data not shown). Therefore, we used a synthetic penta-peptide that has a sequence homology to part of the type III-10 domain repeat of FN, Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGD peptide) for this purpose. Adhesion of cells to either collagen or laminin alone is known to form focal adhesion plaques containing the collagen receptor but not the fibronectin receptor, α5β1. However, under these conditions, inclusion of soluble RGD peptides has been shown to result in the translocation of the fibronectin receptor to preformed focal adhesions, thus serving as integrin agonists (32Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1996; 29: 1151-1158PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this peptide to stimulate integrins, although it is widely used as a blocking peptide for integrin-mediated signaling (32Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1996; 29: 1151-1158PubMed Google Scholar). We used RGE peptide, which does not interact with integrins, as a control peptide for these experiments. We initially analyzed the effect of various concentrations of RGD on the cytoskeletal assembly and activation of signaling proteins using cultured cardiocytes on laminin. RGD treatment as high as 10 mm did not result in the assembly of c-Src, FAK. or the adapter proteins with the cytoskeleton, although all these proteins were present in significant levels in the detergent-soluble fractions (Fig. 3). Similarly, when phosphospecific antibodies for c-Src and FAK were used in the Western blot analyses, no change in the phosphorylation status was observed (data not shown). Because cardiocytes cultured on laminin did not respond to RGD stimulation with cytoskeletal assembly of signaling proteins, we performed a similar experiment using collagen-embedded cardiocytes. A dose response to various concentrations of RGD peptide on the cytoskeletal binding of c-Src was performed initially, and significant levels of c-Src and FAK were present in the cytoskeletal fraction at 6 mm concentration of RGD peptide (data not shown). Therefore, in our subsequent experiments, we prepared collagen-embedded cardiocytes in the absence or presence of 6 mm RGD peptide and studied the assembly and activation of c-Src, FAK, and other signaling proteins as performed for pressure-overloaded ventricular tissue samples. Based on the purity of the RGD peptide (approximately 70%), the actual concentration of RGD in the collagen matrix was calculated to be 4.2 mm. Analysis of the Triton X-100 insoluble samples showed clear association of FAK, c-Src, Nck, and Shc with the cytoskeleton in substantial amounts in response to RGD but not to RGE (Fig. 4 A). However, two other proteins, p130Cas and β3-integrin that showed cytoskeletal binding in pressure-overloaded myocardium did not show appreciable binding to the cytoskeleton in response to RGD treatment. Because both FAK and c-Src are non-receptor tyrosine kinases, we analyzed whether their binding to the cytoskeleton resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytoskeletal proteins. Analyses showed several newly tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of various molecular sizes following RGD treatment but not RGE treatment (Fig.4 B). A protein band corresponding to the molecular size of FAK was significantly phosphorylated in the RGD-treated cytoskeletal sample. However, unlike in the in vivo pressure-overloaded myocardium (Fig. 2 B), RGD treatment did not result in the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins corresponding to the position of p130Cas and c-Src. Furthermore, we repeated RGD treatment of collagen-embedded cardiocytes and used phosphospecific antibodies for Western blot analyses as performed for ventricular tissue samples. FAK, which was recruited to the cytoskeleton of RGD-treated cells, was phosphorylated at the Tyr-397 autophosphorylation site but not at the Tyr-925 site (Fig. 4 C). These data indicate that RGD treatment results in the activation of FAK and possibly creates a site for the recruitment of c-Src. However, both the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-925 and c-Src at Tyr-416 (Fig. 4 C) as well as cytoskel"

We found that the repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA), a protein recruited to the hormone-occupied estrogen receptor (ER), decreased the transcriptional activity of ER, both when ER was acting directly through DNA response elements as well as when it was tethered to other transcription factors. Administration of antisense REA resulted in a 2–4-fold increase in ER transactivation, implying that endogenous REA normally dampens the stimulatory response to estradiol. To define the interaction regions between ER and REA, we used glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. We found that REA bound to the ligand-binding domain (E domain) of ER, but not to other regions of ER, and that REA interaction with ER involved a region in the C-terminal half of REA. REA and the coactivator SRC-1 were involved in a functional competition for regulation of ER transcriptional activity, which we show results from competition between these two coregulators for interaction with ER. REA contains an LXXLL motif near its N terminus, but this motif was not involved in its binding to ER. Rather, this sequence was required for the competitive binding of REA and SRC-1 to ER and thus for optimal repression of ER activity.

These receptors are characterized by a central DNA-binding domain, which interacts with specific hormone response elements located near the target gene promoter, and by two distinct activation function (AF)1 domains that contribute to the transcriptional activity of these receptors. The first activation function, AF-1, is located within the amino-terminal portion of the receptor, whereas the second, hormone-dependent activation function, AF-2, is located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule, overlapping the ligand-binding domain. AF-1 and AF-2 function in a synergistic manner and are required for full transcriptional activity in most cell contexts (4Kraus W.L. McInerney E.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These coregulator proteins are believed to be interposed between the receptor and the basal transcriptional complex. This tripartite action of nuclear hormone receptors, involving the receptor and its ligands and coregulator proteins (10Katzenellenbogen J.A. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), allows for the precise regulation of the biological effects of these hormones on gene expression. In the case of the estrogen receptor (ER), which mediates the biological effects of estrogens in a variety of target tissues and in breast cancer, most of its identified coregulators have been coactivators, including, most prominently, SRC-1 (11Onate S.A.

Most of the coactivators contain a conserved motif, LXXLL (where X is any amino acid), termed the nuclear receptor (NR) box, which has been demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for mediating the binding of these coactivators to the liganded receptor (14Ding X.F.

However, increasing evidence, in part from phage peptide library display, indicates that other peptide motifs are no doubt also involved in ER interaction with its protein partners (20Norris J.D.

This protein is recruited to the hormone-occupied ER and selectively represses the transcriptional activity of the ER, but not that of other steroid and nonsteroid nuclear receptors (23Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In this study, to decipher the mechanisms of REA interaction with the ER, we have characterized the protein-protein interaction surfaces between REA and the ER and elucidated the role of the NR box motif of REA in the repressive activity of REA. We also document that there is competitive binding of REA and coactivators, such as SRC-1, to the ER and show that this competitive binding is lost in REA mutants defective in repressing the ER, implying that such competition represents at least part of the mechanism underlying REA suppression of ER activity. trans-4-Hydroxytamoxifen was kindly provided by Zeneca (Wilmington, DE). Custom oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. pBSK-ERα S554fs was constructed by releasing ERα S554fs from the pCMV5 vector (24Ince B.A. Zhuang Y. Wrenn C.K. Shapiro D.J.

The cDNA insert was subcloned into the BamHI site of pBSK. pBSK-ERα-(1–530) was constructed by releasing ERα-(1–530) from the pCMV5 vector by BamHI digest. The cDNA insert was subcloned into the BamHI site of pBSK. The pBSK vectors for human wild-type ERα and dominant-negative ERα L540Q have been described (23Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). pCMV5-antisense REA was constructed by releasing REA from the pBSK vector by EcoRI/XbaI digest. The cDNA insert was blunted and subcloned into the SmaI site of pCMV5. The antisense orientation of REA was verified with appropriate restriction enzymes. pBSK-ERα(AB) and pBSK-ERα(ABC) mutants were generated by PCR using the full-length pCMV-ERα plasmid as template. Reactions were performed using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The following PCR primers were used (f = forward primer, and r = reverse primer): ERf, 5′-GTGAATTCGCCACGGGACCATGA-3′; ER(AB)r, 5′-GCTCTAGACTCACTTGGCAGATTCCATAGC-3′; and ER(ABC)r, 5′-GCTCTAGACTCATCTCCCTCCTCTTCGGTC-3′. The forward primer contained an ATG codon and a Kozak sequence, and each reverse primer contained a stop codon. PCR fragments were purified, digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and cloned into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of pBSK to generate pBSK-ERα(AB) and pBSK-ERα(ABC). The nucleotide sequences of these mutants were confirmed using the Taq DyeDeoxy and BigDye system (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All the truncations of REA used for GST pull-down assays were generated by PCR using the full-length REA plasmid pCMV-REA (23Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) as template. Reactions with constructed forward and reverse PCR primers were performed using Vent DNA polymerase. Each forward primer contained an ATG codon and an identical Kozak sequence, and each reverse primer contained a stop codon. PCR fragments were purified, digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and cloned into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of pBSK.Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for all plasmid preparations, and E. colistrain BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used in the expression of GST fusion proteins. The three LXXLL mutants were generated using pBSK-REA as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to Kunkel et al. (26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotides REA1 (5′-GCATGGGCACTGCAGCGAAGCTGTTGCTG-3′, AXXLL mutation), REA2 (5′-CTGAAGCTAGCGCTGGGGGCCG-3′, LXXAL mutation), and REA3 (5′-CTGAAGCTTTTGGGCAGGGGCCGGCG-3′, LXXLA mutation), generating the indicated REA alanine substitutions. Following mutagenesis, the REA cDNA was excised from pBSK usingEcoRI/XbaI and ligated into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of the cytomegalovirus-driven expression vector pCMV5. All REA mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and nucleotide sequencing using theTaq DyeDeoxy and BigDye system. Transfections were done in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, HEC-1 human endometrial cancer cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cells were plated for transfection in 24-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfections were performed with an estrogen-responsive reporter plasmid, ER expression vector, and β-galactosidase internal reporter plasmid as described (23Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R.

The cells were harvested 24 h after ligand treatment and lysed with three cycles of freezing on dry ice and thawing at 37 °C. ER transactivation ability was determined by CAT or luciferase activity of the whole cell lysates. CAT or luciferase assays were normalized to β-galactosidase activity from the cotransfected pCMVβ internal reference plasmid. In vitro translation was performed using the TNT kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Briefly, 2 μg of expression vector was mixed with 40 μl of TNT master mixture and 2 μl of [35S]methionine (10 μCi/μl). The final reaction volume was 50 μl. The reaction was performed for 1.5 h at 30 °C. The translation efficiency was checked by loading 1 μl of lysate on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The REA cDNA was released from pBSK-REA by EcoRI/NotI digest and cloned into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pGEX-2TK to generate pGEX-REA. The plasmid pGEX-2TK-ERα, which contains human ERα spanning amino acids 282–595, was kindly provided by Dr. Myles Brown (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). GST-REA interaction with35S-labeled ER (wild-type and mutants) was performed as described (23Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). GST-ER interaction with full-length REA and REA mutants was done using GST-ERα expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified to homogeneity by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. GST or GST-ERα was bound to glutathione-Sepharose and equilibrated with 1× GST binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl (or 300 mm NaCl, where specifically noted), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (4.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins or radioinert proteins, as indicated in each figure legend, were incubated with the immobilized GST fusion protein in 100 μl of 1× GST binding buffer (or 1× GST binding buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, where noted) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with GST binding buffer (0.5 ml) and twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (0.5 ml). Bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Images were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The cDNA encoding full-length REA was inserted into a pET15b vector and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells using standard methods (25Carlson K.E. Choi I. Gee A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The expressed protein was purified under denaturing conditions using a nickel column (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, QIAGEN Inc., Santa Clarita, CA), dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and kept at −80 °C until used. REA-specific rabbit antiserum was raised against purified REA. The immunoglobulin G portion of the antiserum was purified by protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) before use. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 100-mm dishes with 10 μg of tested expression vector. Cells were incubated for 24 h before harvesting in cold Hanks' balanced saline solution. The cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin. Whole cell extracts were prepared by subjecting cells to three rounds of freezing on dry ice and thawing on wet ice, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm to remove cell debris. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford procedure (Pierce). Proteins were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Gelman Instrument Co.). Filters were blocked with 5% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1.5 h and incubated with a 5 μg/ml dilution of the rabbit anti-REA polyclonal antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% dried milk and 0.2% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. After washing the filters with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) for 2 h at a dilution of 1:4000 in the same buffer used for primary antibody incubation. The REA protein was visualized with x-ray film using a chemiluminescence system (Pierce) after washing the filters again under the same conditions as described for the primary wash. Nuclear hormone receptors regulate gene expression by interacting directly with DNA response elements and indirectly via tethering to other transcription factors that bind to DNA (10Katzenellenbogen J.A.

We have previously observed REA-mediated repression of ER transcriptional activation in several cell types with reporter gene constructs containing consensus estrogen response elements (23Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To examine if REA could also suppress ER activity at gene sites containing non-consensus estrogen response elements (such as in the lactoferrin gene or complement C3 promoter) (27Sun J. Meyers M.J. Fink B.E. Rajendran R. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) as well as at gene sites in which the ER does not directly bind to the DNA, but acts at the gene sites via tethering through other transcription factors (such as in the transforming growth factor-β3 promoter) (29Yang N.N. Venugopalan M. Hardikar S. Glasebrook A. Science. 1996; 273: 1222-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), experiments were carried out with these gene constructs. As shown in Fig. 1, REA effectively reduced the transcriptional activity of the ER at these three different target gene sites, and it did so in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, REA acts generally to suppress ER transcriptional activity at diverse gene sites under ER regulation. To demonstrate whether the endogenous REA protein in cells acts as a repressor of ER activity, we used an antisense REA-encoding plasmid to reduce the endogenous level of REA (Fig. 2). An expression plasmid encoding wild-type REA or an antisense REA-encoding plasmid was cotransfected with an estrogen-responsive reporter gene and an ER expression vector into two different cell types, Chinese hamster ovary cells and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Upon expression of increased wild-type REA by transfection (REA sense plasmid), transcriptional activation by the ER decreased in both cell lines, as expected. Of note, administration of the antisense REA-encoding plasmid resulted in a 2–4-fold increase in the magnitude of ER transactivation (Fig. 2, A and B), implying that endogenous REA normally dampens the stimulatory response to estradiol. To map the REA interaction domains on the ER, a GST fusion protein containing full-length REA was tested for its ability to interact in vitro with 35S-labeled wild-type ER and with several ER mutants (Fig. 3). As previously reported (23Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), radiolabeled wild-type ER interacted with GST-REA, but not with GST alone; and the interaction of the receptor with REA required estrogen (10−6m17β-estradiol (E2)) or antiestrogen (10−6m trans-4-hydroxytamoxifen) and was not observed in the absence of hormone. GST-REA also interacted well with the DEF domain of ERα and with a transcriptionally inactive, dominant-negative form of the ER (L540Q) with a point mutation in the AF-2 region of the hormone-binding domain. This interaction was still effective if the F domain of the ER was missing, as in the case of the ER-(1–530) mutant, or if the F domain was altered by a frameshift mutation, as in ER S554fs. These are both dominant-negative ERs that are able to heterodimerize with and inactivate the wild-type ER (24Ince B.A. Zhuang Y. Wrenn C.K. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14026-14032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schodin D.J. Zhuang Y. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3194-3199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, these two receptors showed considerable interaction with REA in the absence of ligand, suggesting that the presence of the F domain in the wild-type ER may serve to prevent the recruitment of REA to the ER in the absence of ligand. This may be of relevance since these mutants show little or no binding of coactivators such as SRC-1, 2T. Ediger, D. J. Schodin, and B. S. Katzenellenbogen, unpublished observations. perhaps because of REA occupancy even in the absence of ligand (as discussed further below). GST-REA also interacted with only the E domain (amino acids 304–554) of ERα. By contrast, when the ER was reduced to the AB or ABC domain, the ability to interact with REA was totally abolished. Taken together, these results indicate that domains A–D and F of the receptor are not necessary for REA binding and that the REA interaction region of the ER is localized between residues 304 and 530 in domain E. GST interaction assays were used to examine the regions of REA that interact with the ER. None of the REA proteins bound to GST alone, and full-length REA interacted well with GST-ER in the presence of E2, as shown in Fig. 4. Deletion of the first 19 (REA-(19–299)) or 65 (REA-(65–299)) amino acids from the amino terminus of REA still allowed good binding to the ER. Likewise, deletion of the last 39 (REA-(1–260)) or 101 (REA-(1–198)) amino acids still allowed effective interaction with the ER. Of note, however, deletion of the last 125 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of REA (REA-(1–174)) resulted in a protein showing little interaction with the ER. Thus, strong interaction with the ER appears to require elements in the carboxyl-terminal part of REA, in which residues 175–198 are essential. REA contains one LXXLL domain, called the NR box, at amino acids 23–27 (LKLLL), a signature sequence known to be important in the interaction of many coregulators with nuclear receptors (16Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Although the interaction studies described above with amino-terminally truncated REA proteins indicate that this NR box is not required for REA interaction with the ER, we wished to investigate whether this NR box plays a role in the ability of REA to repress the transcriptional activity of the ER. To investigate the functional significance of the REA leucine-rich NR box motif, we introduced point mutations in the LXXLL motif of REA so as to create single alanine substitutions for each of the leucines in the NR box (Fig. 5). The ability of each LXXLL mutant to suppress the transcriptional activity of the ER was tested in reporter gene transfection assays (Fig.5 A). Each REA mutant was found to be less effective than wild-type REA in suppression of ER transcriptional activity. The greatest loss in repressive ability was observed when alanine was substituted in the middle of the LXXLL domain (LKLAL mutant). In this case, the percent repression was reduced 4-fold. These data indicate that the integrity of the LXXLL domain is necessary for optimal repression by REA, although this motif (as shown in Fig. 4) is not required for REA binding to the ER. Fig. 5 B shows that all of the LXXLL mutant proteins were expressed at very similar levels to that of the wild-type REA protein. Thus, the differences in their effectiveness in repression of ER activity appear not to be due to differences in protein expression. To determine if the differences in the effectiveness in transcriptional repression by the three LXXLL mutants might be explained by a decrease in the ability of the REA mutants to bind the ER, we tested their abilities to bind to the ER (Fig.6) and to compete with wild-type REA for binding to the ER (Fig. 7). The wild-type and mutant REA cDNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro and then assayed for ER interaction in GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 6, the LXXLL mutants were able to bind to the ER in the presence of estradiol, and wild-type REA and each mutant showed a similar magnitude of interaction with the ER.Figure 7Competition assays with wild-type and mutant REA proteins for binding to the ER. GST-ER was incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled wild-type REA in the presence of estradiol (10−6m) and increasing amounts of radioinert wild-type (A) or mutant (Band C) REA at 1:1 (×1), 1:3 (×3), and 1:6 (×6) ratios of 35S-labeled REA to radioinert wild-type or mutant REA as indicated, made by in vitro translation. Autoradiograms and densitometric analyses are shown. The percent 35S-labeled REA binding in the absence of competitor REA (set at 100%) or in the presence of increasing radioinert competitor REA protein is indicated under each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the binding of these mutants to the ER more quantitatively, we compared the displacement of radiolabeled wild-type REA from the ER with increasing concentrations of radioinert wild-type or LXXLL mutant REA.

https://openalex.org/W2096539811,"The folding and assembly of nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum are assisted by the molecular chaperone calnexin, which is itself retained within the endoplasmic reticulum. It was up to now assumed that calnexin was selectively expressed on the surface of immature thymocytes because of a particular characteristic of the protein sorting machinery in these cells. We now report that a small fraction of calnexin is normally expressed on the surface of various cells such as mastocytoma cells, murine splenocytes, fibroblast cells, and human HeLa cells. Surface biotinylation followed by chase culture of living cells revealed that calnexin is continuously delivered to the cell surface and then internalized for lysosomal degradation. These results suggest that there is continuous exocytosis and endocytosis of calnexin, and the amount of calnexin on the plasma membrane results from the balance of the rates of these two events. To study the structural requirement of calnexin for surface expression, we created deletion mutants of calnexin and found that the luminal domain, particularly the glycoprotein binding domain, is necessary. These findings suggest that the surface expression of calnexin depends on the association with glycoproteins and that calnexin may play a certain role as a chaperone on the plasma membrane as well."
https://openalex.org/W2037271207,"Polyadenylate [poly(A)] polymerase (PAP) catalyzes the addition of a polyadenosine tail to almost all eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The crystal structure of the PAP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pap1) has been solved to 2.6 angstroms, both alone and in complex with 3'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (3'-dATP). Like other nucleic acid polymerases, Pap1 is composed of three domains that encircle the active site. The arrangement of these domains, however, is quite different from that seen in polymerases that use a template to select and position their incoming nucleotides. The first two domains are functionally analogous to polymerase palm and fingers domains. The third domain is attached to the fingers domain and is known to interact with the single-stranded RNA primer. In the nucleotide complex, two molecules of 3'-dATP are bound to Pap1. One occupies the position of the incoming base, prior to its addition to the mRNA chain. The other is believed to occupy the position of the 3' end of the mRNA primer."
https://openalex.org/W2107144297,"G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels are widely expressed in the brain and are activated by at least eight different neurotransmitters. As K+ channels, they drive the transmembrane potential toward EK when open and thus dampen neuronal excitability. There are four mammalian GIRK subunits (GIRK1–4 or Kir 3.1–4), with GIRK1 being the most unique of the four by possessing a long carboxyl-terminal tail. Early studies suggested that GIRK1 was an integral component of native GIRK channels. However, more recent data indicate that native channels can be either homo- or heterotetrameric complexes composed of several GIRK subunit combinations. The functional implications of subunit composition are poorly understood at present. The purpose of this study was to examine the functional and biochemical properties of GIRK channels formed by the co-assembly of GIRK2 and GIRK3, the most abundant GIRK subunits found in the mammalian brain. To examine the properties of a channel composed of these two subunits, we co-transfected GIRK2 and GIRK3 in CHO-K1 cells and assayed the cells for channel activity by patch clamp. The most significant difference between the putative GIRK2/GIRK3 heteromultimeric channel and GIRK1/GIRKx channels at the single channel level was an ∼5-fold lower sensitivity to activation by Gβγ. Complexes containing only GIRK2 and GIRK3 could be immunoprecipitated from transfected cells and could be purified from native brain tissue.

In the nervous system, heart, pancreas, and other tissues, transmitters activate the GIRK channels via an apparently identical Gβγ-linked signal transduction mechanism. The G protein-linked receptor subtypes that activate these channels include muscarinic (M2), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAB), serotonin (5HT1A), adenosine (P1), somatostatin, enkephalin (μ, κ, δ), α2−adrenergic, and dopamine (D2) receptors. GIRK channels composed of GIRK1 subunits in combination with either GIRK2, GIRK3, or GIRK4 subunits have indistinguishable single channel conductances, open times, and Gβγ sensitivities (1Jelacic T.M.

We combined electrophysiological and biochemical approaches to determine if a GIRK heteromultimer composed of GIRK2 and GIRK3 subunits alone was functional and if such a channel exists in vivo. GIRK2 and GIRK3 subunits had been previously coexpressed in Xenopusoocyte expression studies (16Schoots O. Wilson J.M. Ethier N. Bigras E. Hebert T.E. Van Tol H.H.M. Cell.

In this study, we examine this subunit combination in mammalian cells. We demonstrate that GIRK2/GIRK3 forms a functional channel in heterologous cells and that a GIRK2/GIRK3 complex can be purified from both heterologous expression systems and native brain tissue. CHO-K1 cells were grown and maintained in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Hamm's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. CHO-K1 cells were transfected usingTransIt™-LT1 (Pan Vera Corp., Madison, WI) in OptiMEM I medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The pGreen Lantern plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.) was cotransfected with GIRK-containing pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1(−) expression vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a 1:4 ratio as a transfection marker for patch clamp experiments. GIRK plasmids were co-transfected in a 1:1 ratio. The GIRK2- and GIRK3-containing plasmids used have been described previously (1Jelacic T.M. Sims S.M. Clapham D.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Navarro B. Kennedy M.E. Velimirovic B. Bhat D. Peterson A. Clapham D.E. Science. 1996; 272: 1950-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Transfected CHO-K1 cells were detached from their dishes with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, resuspended in growth medium, and transferred to glass coverslips for patch clamp experiments. COS-7 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. COS-7 cells were plated at 2 × 106cells/100-mm2 dish the day before transfection using either LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) or TransIt™-LT1. Single channel recordings were made from patches in the inside-out configuration in symmetrical high K+ (140 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). Patch electrodes were prepared from borosilicate capillary glass (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) and polished to a resistance of 5–12 megaohms. Patches were activated by application of either 40 μm GTPγS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 2–90 nm purified bovine brain Gβγ (2Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Velimirovic B. Wickman K. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28777-28779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to the cytoplasmic face of the patch. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA), filtered at 2 kHz by a four-pole low pass Bessel filter, and sampled at 10 kHz. Records of channels in inside-out patches activated by 40 μm GTPγS were collected at voltages ranging from −100 to −40 mV. Unitary current values from all patches were averaged, and the slope conductance was determined as the best fit to the mean data. Channel open times were determined for 10-s records of inside-out patches activated by 40 μm GTPγS collected at −100 mV. Log analysis (21Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) was used for determination of channel mean open time (τo). The concentration dependence of channel activation by Gβγ was examined by adding increasing concentrations of Gβγ to the bath while recording the channel activity. Patches were excised into the standard bath solution, and basal activity was recorded for 2.5 min before Gβγ was added to an initial concentration of 2 nm. Additional Gβγ was added incrementally at 2.5-min intervals until a final concentration of 60 or 90 nm was reached. 2.5 min after the highest Gβγ concentration was attained, 100 μm GTPγS was added to the bath. NPowas determined for the final minute of each Gβγ concentration step. NPo values were normalized to the final activity level 1.5 min after the addition of GTPγS for each patch in order to derive relative NPo values. Relative NPo values from all patches were averaged, and the dose-response curve was determined as the best fit to the mean data. Membrane proteins were isolated from single 100-mm2 dishes of CHO-K1 cells transfected with GIRK1 plus GIRK2, GIRK1 plus GIRK3, and GIRK2 plus GIRK3. To serve as a control, membrane proteins were also isolated from untransfected cells. The cells were washed twice with PBS before being lifted from the dish with 5 mm EDTA in PBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 5 min. Cold hypotonic 5/5/5 lysis buffer (5 mm each of Tris-HCl, EDTA, and EGTA; pH 8) with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin) was added to the cells, which were lysed on ice by drawing them through a 23-gauge needle 10 times and a 27-gauge needle four times. Crude membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The crude membranes were resuspended in 5/5/5 buffer with protease inhibitors, and the proteins were precipitated with 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (Sigma). The precipitated proteins were dissolved in 1× SDS sample buffer and assayed by Western blot with anti-GIRK1 fusion protein antibody αCSh (anti-CSh serum, generated against the carboxyl-terminal 156 amino acids of GIRK1) or with anti-GIRK1 antibody (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). Epitope-tagged GIRK2-Myc and GIRK3-AU1 constructs were transfected in the recombinant coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The GIRK2-Myc construct has been described previously (20Navarro B. Kennedy M.E. Velimirovic B. Bhat D. Peterson A. Clapham D.E. Science. 1996; 272: 1950-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The AU1 epitope, DTYRYI, was inserted after the initiator methionine in the pcDNA3.1-GIRK3 plasmid using the QuickChangeTMmutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primer sequences used were 5′-CCCGCTGCGGCCGCCATGGACACTTACCGCTATATTGCGCAGGAGAACG-3′ and 5′-GCGTTCTCCTGCGCAATATAGCGGTAAGTGTCCATGGCGGCCGCAGCGG-3′. Positive clones were identified by the introduction of a unique FspI restriction site, and the integrity of the tagged GIRK3 sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. COS-7 cells were used for the recombinant coimmunoprecipitation experiments because they produced significantly more expressed protein than the CHO-K1 cells. COS-7 cells have been used to examine GIRK channels in previous functional studies (7Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Clapham D.E.

Single 100-mm2dishes of COS-7 cells expressing GIRK2-Myc and GIRK3-AU1 were washed twice with PBS (22 °C) before being lifted from the dish with 5 mm EDTA in PBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 5 min. Hypotonic 5/5/5 lysis buffer with protease inhibitors was added to the cells, which were lysed on ice by drawing them through a 23-gauge needle 10 times. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain a crude particulate fraction. This fraction was resuspended in 5/5/5 with protease inhibitors and centrifuged through a 20% sucrose cushion at 150,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was solubilized in 1% CHAPS, 10 mmHEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors at pH 8.0. For immunoprecipitation, samples were precleared with Gammabind-G Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Centrifuged ascites fluid for AU1 monoclonal antibodies (BabCO, Richmond, CA) was used at a 1:200 dilution. Samples were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C on a rotator. Bound proteins were eluted with 1× SDS sample buffer at 55 °C for 20 min. The eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blot with anti-GIRK2 antibody (Alomone Laboratories) and rabbit anti-GIRK3 antibody C-312 (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA) against a carboxyl-terminal peptide antigen (SIPSRLDEKVEEEGAGEGGR). The specificity of anti-GIRK3 antibody C-312 was confirmed against a panel of recombinant GIRK proteins expressed in COS-7 cells. Whole brains were removed from wild-type and GIRK3 knockout mice. 2Tanya M. Jelacic, Matthew E. Kennedy, Kevin Wickman, and David E. Clapham, manuscript in preparation. The tissue was minced in homogenization buffer (320 mm sucrose, 4 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin) on ice before homogenization with a Polytron homogenizer (2 × 15 s). The homogenized tissue was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and large cellular fragments. The supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 120,000 × g at 4 °C to pellet the membranes. The pelleted membranes were resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, pH 7.53) with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Solubilized membranes were stored at −80 °C. GIRK2/GIRK3 complexes were purified by serial immunoprecipitation. Any potential GIRK1-containing complexes were eliminated in the first two rounds of immunoprecipitation so that any complex containing GIRK1, GIRK2, and GIRK3 would not be mistakenly identified as one containing only GIRK2 and GIRK3. The third round was designed to immunoprecipitate remaining complexes that contained only GIRK2 and/or GIRK3 subunits. Each serial experiment tested three wild-type samples against three GIRK3 knockout mouse samples. One tube in each group was a control containing no antibody. Anti-GIRK1 serum αCSh was prebound for 8 h to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a 1:92 dilution. The resin was washed 7× with 1-ml aliquots of immunoprecipitation buffer before 200 μg of whole brain membrane proteins from wild-type or GIRK3 knockout mice were added. Samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotator and centrifuged, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes containing additional αCSh bound to protein A-Sepharose. For the second round of GIRK1 removal, the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h on a rotator. Afterward, supernatant samples were assayed for GIRK1 by Western blotting with αCSh. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes containing anti-GIRK2 antibody (Alomone Laboratories) at a 1:174 dilution or anti-GIRK3 antibody C-312 at a 1:67 dilution. The antibodies were preincubated with protein A-Sepharose and washed seven times with 1-ml aliquots of immunoprecipitation buffer prior to sample addition and incubation at 4 °C overnight. Supernatants were removed before the resin was washed, and bound proteins were eluted with 1× SDS sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma; 55 °C for 20 min). Eluted proteins were run on 10% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels in MOPS buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA), providing maximal separation of proteins in the 35–55-kDa range. To avoid confusing signals from the GIRK proteins with the heavy chains of the immunoglobulins used to purify them, the blots were probed with biotinylated anti-GIRK2 (Alomone Laboratories) and biotinylated C-312 anti-GIRK3 antibodies, followed by incubation with strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase. The antibodies were biotinylated using E-Z-Link NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce). In order to examine the properties of a potential channel composed of GIRK2 and GIRK3 subunits, CHO-K1 cells were cotransfected with GIRK2 and GIRK3 and assayed for channel activity by patch clamp. Inside-out patches of transfected cells contained channels that could be activated by application of GTPγS to the cytoplasmic face of the patch and which displayed inward rectification (Fig.1). The slope conductance of the channel was 31 ± 1.7 picosiemens (± S.E.; n = 14), smaller than that observed for GIRK1/GIRK2, GIRK1/GIRK3, and GIRK1/GIRK4 channels (35, 39, and 37 picosiemens, respectively) in our previous study (1Jelacic T.M. Sims S.M. Clapham D.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) but still within the range of conductance values reported for GIRK channels (24Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The τo at −100 mV for the GIRK2/GIRK3 channel was 1.3 ms (n = 11), similar to that for GIRK1/GIRK2, GIRK1/GIRK3, and GIRK1/GIRK4 channels at −80 mV (1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 ms, respectively) (1Jelacic T.M. Sims S.M. Clapham D.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results were surprising, considering that any one of the GIRK2, GIRK3, or GIRK4 subunits expressed alone yields spiky, irregular channels with very brief open times (1Jelacic T.M. Sims S.M. Clapham D.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Velimirovic B.M. Gordon E.A. Lim N.F. Navarro B. Clapham D.E.

Since activation by Gβγ is a hallmark feature of GIRK channels, the concentration dependence of GIRK2/GIRK3 channel activation was determined. Inside-out patches containing the channel were exposed to increasing concentrations of Gβγ at regularly timed intervals until a final concentration was reached (see Ref. 25Wickman K.D. Iniguez-Lluhl J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). At a set time interval after reaching the final Gβγ concentration, a saturating concentration of GTPγS was added to the bath. The channel activity, quantitated as NPo at each concentration of Gβγ, was determined and normalized to the NPo after the addition of GTPγS in order to derive relative values. The relative activity was plotted against log concentrations of Gβγ to determine the concentration required to elicit half-maximal activation of the channel (Fig. 2). While GIRK1/GIRK4 and GIRK1/GIRK3 are activated by Gβγ with a half-maximal concentration of 11 nm (1Jelacic T.M. Sims S.M. Clapham D.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Spauschus A. Lentes K.-U. Wischmeyer E. Dissmann E. Karschin C. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 930-938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the GIRK2/GIRK3 channel displays a half-maximal concentration of 53 nm, a 4.8-fold lower sensitivity to Gβγ. Two-way factorial analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in the slopes of the two dose-response curves, but GIRK1/GIRK3 is significantly more sensitive to Gβγ than GIRK2/GIRK3; F (1, 25) = 8.77, p = 0.007. CHO-K1 cells do not normally express GIRK channel subunits. To rule out the possibility that cotransfection of GIRK2 and GIRK3 could induce the cells to express GIRK1, membrane proteins were harvested from cotransfected cells and tested for the presence of GIRK1 protein by Western blotting. CHO-K1 cells transfected with GIRK1/GIRK2 and GIRK1/GIRK3 were used as positive controls for GIRK1 expression, while untransfected CHO-K1 cells were used as a negative control. Two separate anti-GIRK1 antibodies were used to test for GIRK1 expression. In both cases, GIRK1 protein could be detected only in cells that had been transfected with GIRK1 cDNA (Fig.3). To examine whether or not cotransfected GIRK2 and GIRK3 subunits were able to form heteromultimeric complexes, we coimmunoprecipitated the GIRK channel proteins from COS-7 cells transfected with epitope-tagged GIRK subunits. After cotransfection with the GIRK2-Myc and GIRK3-AU1 constructs, membrane proteins from COS-7 cells were harvested, and ascites fluid for monoclonal AU1 antibodies was used to immunoprecipitate GIRK3-AU1 and any associated proteins. These proteins were eluted and transferred to a membrane for Western blot analysis with subunit-specific anti-GIRK2 and anti-GIRK3 antibodies. The specific recognition of their respective GIRK proteins by these antibodies can be seen in Fig. 4,A and B. Analysis of the eluted proteins by Western blot demonstrated the presence of both GIRK3 and GIRK2 in the AU1 ascites pellet (Fig. 4 C). These coimmunoprecipitation data strongly support the notion that GIRK2 and GIRK3 subunits can combine to form a heteromultimeric complex in transfected mammalian cells. To test whether heteromultimeric complexes of GIRK2 and GIRK3 subunits might exist in vivo, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using mouse brain as the tissue source. Membranes solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 buffer were prepared from wild-type and GIRK3 knockout (control) mouse brains.2 Unlike the heterologous expression system, the native system is complicated by the presence of GIRK1. A straightforward GIRK2/GIRK3 coimmunoprecipitation experiment would have ambiguous results because it would be uncertain whether or not the complex containing GIRK2 and GIRK3 also contained GIRK1. To avoid this ambiguity, the solubilized membranes were first immunodepleted of GIRK1 by two rounds of GIRK1 immunoprecipitation before immunoprecipitation of GIRK2 and GIRK3. After the second round of GIRK1 immunodepletion, small supernatant samples were tested for GIRK1 by Western analysis. As Fig.5 A shows, GIRK1 protein was successfully removed, leaving a GIRK1-free protein pool from which we could immunoprecipitate GIRK2 and GIRK3. The final immunoprecipitates and control supernatants were analyzed by Western blot for GIRK2 and GIRK3 coimmunoprecipitation. Fig. 5 B shows the final immunoprecipitates and control supernatants probed with anti-GIRK2 antibody. The GIRK2 signal from native brain membranes consistently appeared as a doublet, suggesting that at least two GIRK2 isoforms are present (26Wei J. Hodes M.E. Piva R. Feng Y. Wang Y. Ghetti B. Dlouhy S.R. Genomics. 1998; 51: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Isomoto S. Kondo C. Takahashi N. Matsumoto S. Yamada M. Takumi T. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 218: 286-291Google Scholar). GIRK2 protein was recovered from the control supernatant and both the anti-GIRK2 and anti-GIRK3 immunoprecipitates of the wild-type samples but was recovered only from the control supernatant and the anti-GIRK2 immunoprecipitate of the GIRK3 knockout samples. The presence of GIRK2 in the anti-GIRK3 wild-type immunoprecipitate together with its absence from the anti-GIRK3 knockout immunoprecipitate indicates that GIRK2 was pulled down by the anti-GIRK3 antibody most likely because it was complexed with GIRK3. Fig. 5 C shows the final immunoprecipitates and control supernatants probed with an anti-GIRK3 antibody. GIRK3 was recovered from the control supernatant and both the anti-GIRK2 and anti-GIRK3 immunoprecipitates of the wild-type samples. As expected, no GIRK3 signal was seen for the GIRK3 knockout samples. The presence of GIRK3 in the anti-GIRK2 wild-type immunoprecipitate reinforces the evidence of coimmunoprecipitation seen with the anti-GIRK3 antibody. These results demonstrate that complexes containing GIRK2 and GIRK3 without GIRK1 can be immunoprecipitated from native brain. We have demonstrated that GIRK2/GIRK3 channels are functional, exist in native brain tissue, and are less sensitive to Gβγ than GIRK1-containing channels. When GIRK2, GIRK3, or GIRK4 subunits are transfected alone, each gives rise to “spiky” channels with very brief open times (<0.5 ms) and variable single channel conductance (20–40 picosiemens) (1Jelacic T.M.

Co-transfecting either subunit with GIRK1 yields a heteromultimeric channel with characteristics like the prototypical GIRK channel, IKACh. The uniqueness of GIRK1 has attracted a series of hypotheses to account for its long carboxyl-terminal tail, including the idea that it modifies the gating of the GIRK heteromultimer to yield longer open times. As we have shown, co-transfecting GIRK2 and GIRK3 into CHO cells verifiably lacking GIRK1 gives rise to an inwardly rectifying current with single channel properties much like those described for the GIRK1-containing channels. It thus appears that the longer open time does not depend on the presence of GIRK1 but that heteromultimerization places the subunits in the proper conformation to achieve a longer open time and quantized conductance level. Despite its similarities with respect to open time and conductance, the GIRK2/GIRK3 channel differed from the GIRK1/GIRKx channels in being nearly 5-fold less sensitive to activation by Gβγ. A recent study has shown that residues proximal to the membrane in the carboxy tail region of GIRK4 are important for binding by Gβγ and critical for activation of IKACh (10Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M. Nemec J. Medina I. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16946-16952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The similarity of this region (e.g. C216) in GIRK2 and GIRK3 probably accounts in part for the similar responses of the GIRK1/GIRK4 and GIRK1/GIRK3 channels to Gβγ (1Jelacic T.M. Sims S.M. Clapham D.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the same study and others have demonstrated that GIRK1 also binds Gβγ (11Huang C.-L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, Gβγ binding to GIRK1 may have a potentiating effect, or perhaps GIRK1 and GIRK4 both contribute to the binding site for Gβγ, and GIRK1's contribution may be to increase the affinity for Gβγ. Alternatively, GIRK1 may contribute to or affect the binding site for a modulating molecule such as inositol 1,4,5-bisphosphate, which has been shown to play an important role in the activation of IKACh by Gβγ and by intracellular Na+ (29Sui J.L.

The lower sensitivity of GIRK2/GIRK3 channels to activation by Gβγ may partly explain why the GIRK currents in Xenopus oocytes co-injected with cRNAs for these subunits are so small (16Schoots O.

Ethier N. Bigras E. Hebert T.E. Van Tol H.H.M. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 871-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Wischmeyer E. Doring F. Wischmeyer E. Spauschus A. Thomzig A. Veh R.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The combination of poor expression of the channel with its decreased sensitivity to Gβγ may account for the small peak currents observed for GIRK2/GIRK3 in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast, GIRK3 and GIRK2/GIRK3 express well in mammalian cells. In addition to providing enhanced Gβγ sensitivity, GIRK1 may also provide a second localization mechanism via its unique carboxy tail. Additional diversity comes from the fact that GIRK3 and the long form of GIRK2 both have potential PDZ-binding motifs at their carboxyl termini. The variety of GIRK channel combinations may allow for specificity of localization of channels in the neuron, at pre- or postsynaptic sites for example, or for linking of channel subtypes to specific neurotransmitter receptors. Most regions in the brain have the potential to produce GIRK2/GIRK3 channels because they express GIRK1, GIRK2, and GIRK3 mRNAs (13Chen S.C. Ehrhard P. Goldowitz D. Smeyne R.J. Brain Res. 1997; 778: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Karschin C. Dissmann E. Stuhmer W. Karschin A. J.

The expression of GIRK1 does not preclude the formation of complexes that do not contain GIRK1, and cells may produce more than one type of GIRK channel. This is clearly illustrated by the presence of GIRK4 homomeric complexes in atrial cells expressing IKACh (35Corey S. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27499-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is possible that a neuron that produces GIRK1/GIRK2 and GIRK1/GIRK3 channels may also produce GIRK2/GIRK3 channels. GIRK2/GIRK3 channels have a different sensitivity to activation by Gβγ and may be localized differently than channels containing GIRK1. Thus, there may be regions within neurons where GIRK2/GIRK3 channels are more common than GIRK1/GIRK2 or GIRK1/GIRK3 channel complexes. In summary, we have demonstrated the existence in brain of a heteromultimeric GIRK channel composed of GIRK2 and GIRK3 subunits. These channels have a similar open time to the GIRK1/GIRKx channels but have a slightly smaller conductance and less sensitivity to activation by Gβγ. The discovery of this channel, with its lesser sensitivity to Gβγ and hence lower threshold of activation, along with its potential for differential localization from the GIRK1/GIRKx channels, broadens the functional scope of the GIRK family of channels. We thank Grigory Krapivinsky for providing purified bovine brain Gβγ and David Zurakowski for help with the statistics. We also thank Christov Roberson and Stephen Sims for critical reading of the manuscript."

We identified heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 as a protein interacting in vitro and in vivo with regulatory splice elements in CD44 variant exon v5. Transient overexpression of hnRNP A1 prevented v5 exon inclusion, dependent on the exonic elements. HnRNP A1-dependent repression was exon-specific and could be relieved by coexpression of oncogenic forms of Ras and Cdc42.

The generation of alternatively spliced mRNAs can be regulated, e.g.according to the developmental or physiological state of cells in an organism (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Wang J. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and 2Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Pre-mRNA splicing is accomplished by large ribonucleoprotein complexes called spliceosomes, which are assembled on pre-mRNA, directed by small conserved sequences localized at the intron ends, the splice sites (3Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-358Google Scholar). Several alternatively spliced pre-mRNAs have been shown to contain regulatory sequences, in addition to the splice sites, that can affect splice site selection dependent on developmental cues. Such sequences have been found in exons and introns, both in Drosophila and mammalian pre-mRNAs (reviewed in Refs. 2Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 3Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. The RNA World.

In contrast, in mammalian cells, factors that govern alternative splicing during differentiation processes or in pathological conditions are largely unknown. Likewise, the mechanisms underlying the regulated generation of complex splice patterns due to selection between multiple alternatively spliced exons, a hallmark of many genes encoding highly variable proteins, are still elusive. Selection of splice sites in mammalian cells has been studied primarily by biochemical means. Two groups of proteins have been found that can affect splice site choice: serine/arginine-rich (SR)1 proteins (for reviews on SR proteins and splicing, see Refs. 7Horowitz D.S. Krainer A.R.

We showed previously by cell fusion experiments the existence oftrans-acting factors regulating the expression of CD44 isoforms in different cell types and in tumor cells (28König H. Moll J. Ponta H. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4030-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, using a minigene containing CD44 exon v5, an exon sequence frequently included in mRNA upon activation of immune cells and during tumor progression, we could identify splice regulatory RNA elements for this exon. These elements are located within the v5 exon coding sequence and are necessary for cell type-specific exon inclusion as well as for inclusion of the exon in response to phorbol-ester tumor promoters or oncogenic Ras (29König H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Here we show that the splice regulatory elements of exon v5 are recognized by hnRNP A1 and that hnRNP A1, dependent on these elements, represses inclusion of the exon in vivo. Silencing of exon inclusion by hnRNP A1 is exon-specific and is relieved by oncogenic forms of the small G proteins p21Ras and Cdc42. These findings define hnRNP A1 as a decisive component of an oncogene-controlled splice-silencing complex, which can select between multiple alternatively spliced exons. CB3 erythroleukemia cells (30; kindly provided by Yaacov Ben-David) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10 μmβ-mercaptoethanol. S194 mouse plasmacytoma cells (obtained from Thomas Wirth), KLN205 mouse carcinoma cells (ATCC CRL-1453), and NIH-3T3 cells (ECACC CB2435) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. All cells were grown at 37 °C and 6% CO2. Transfections were performed using the polycationic reagent SuperFect (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Unless stated otherwise, in the cotransfection experiments analyzed by RT-PCR, 2 μg of CD44 v5 minigene-plasmid DNA were cotransfected with 8 μg of hnRNP A1 expression plasmid or empty expression plasmid. For analysis of hnRNP A1 expression levels in cotransfections, 8 μg of the expression plasmid for myc-tagged hnRNP A1 was used. Where indicated, 2 μg of expression constructs for activated Ras, Cdc42, MEKK1, or corresponding control constructs were transfected. Transfection efficiency of NIH-3T3 cells was assessed by transfecting cells with pCMVSPORT-βgal (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by X-gal staining. The CD44 v5 minigene pETv5 and the mutants ΔLblue, ΔMblue, and v5bls7 have been described previously (29König H. Ponta H. Herrlich P.

The v5ΔR(TnT)2 construct was generated by cloning a dimer of the oligonucleotides CGCGGAGGAAGAA (upper strand) and CGCGTTCTTCCTC (lower strand), spanning a 9-bp exonic enhancer element of the cardiac troponin T exon 5 (31Xu R.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), but instead of exon v4, exon v5 had been deleted by PCR. The exon v6- and the exon v7-containing minigenes pETv6 and pETv7 were generated by introducing a 950-bp XbaI/SacI fragment and a 2-kbSacI/XbaI fragment, respectively, from the murineCD44 gene into the multiple cloning site of pL53In (Mobitec). The murine hnRNP A1 cDNA (30; kindly provided by Yaacov Ben-David) was cloned as a 1.4-kb EcoRI fragment into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) in sense and antisense orientation, respectively. The hnRNP A1 cDNA sequence was amplified via PCR with Pwo polymerase by the primers TGCTCTAGATCTAAGTCCGAGTCTCCCAAG and CGCGGATCCTTAGAACCTCCTGCCACTGCC, introducing a 5′-XbaI site and a 3′-BamHI site. The amplified cDNA was cloned together with a synthetic oligonucleotide sequence introducing a human c-myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) into ApaI/BamHI of pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). The epitope-encoding oligonucleotide contained a 5′-ApaI site and a 3′-XbaI site and had the following sequence: CGCCACCATGGCCCAGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGT (upper strand) and CTAGACAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCCTGGGCCATGGTGGCGGGCC (lower strand). RSV-Ras expresses the activated Ha-Ras mutant leucine 61 (32). pCMV5-MEKK1 and pRK5mycCdcd42 express MEKK1 as described previously (33Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), with an additional C-terminal his tag (kindly provided by Peter Shaw) and an L61 mutant of Cdc42 carrying an N-terminal myc epitope (34; obtained from Alan Hall), respectively. All constructs used were based on plasmids of the RNA-Protein Hybrid Hunter system from Invitrogen. pYESTrp2-A1 expresses a fusion of hnRNP A1 and an N-terminal B42 transactivation domain and was obtained by introducing the murine hnRNP A1 cDNA as a BamHI/XhoI fragment (after Pwo polymerase amplification) into the multiple cloning site of pYESTrp2. For the hybrid-RNA-expressing plasmid pRH5′-v5, a 180-bp fragment from pETv5, spanning CD44 exon v5 and approximately 30 bp of upstream and downstream intron sequences, was introduced as an AatII/KpnI (blunt) fragment intoAatII/SmaI of pRH5′. pRH5′-blue, expressing a control hybrid-RNA in which the v5 exon sequence (except for the four 5′-most and the three 3′-most nucleotides) had been replaced for a pBluescript polylinker sequence, was obtained accordingly, using a corresponding AatII/KpnI fragment from pETv5blue (29König H.

Preparation of cytoplasmic RNA and RT-PCR analyses was carried out as described previously (29König H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), comprising 35 PCR cycles. PCR reactions were in the linear phase (not in the plateau phase) under these conditions as shown by unchanged ratios between the amplification products for exon inclusion and exon skipping when using different amounts of cDNA. RT-PCR bands were quantified densitometrically after scanning using the Fuji Aida program. Three independent experiments were performed. Within an experiment, the differences observed in the ratios of exon inclusion between wild-type and mutant v5 exons were very similar (<10% variation). The same was true when comparing the on and off situation of oncogenic signaling. RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized with two 5′-biotin residues (Eurogentec Bel S.A.) and had the following sequences: L, AUAGACAGAAUCAGCACCAGUGCUCAUGGAGAAAAUUGGACC; M, CCCCGGAACCACAGCCUCCUUUCAAUAACCAUGAGUAUCAGG; R, GAGUAUCAGGAUGAAGAGGAGACCCCACAUGCUACAAGCACA; Blue, GGUAUCGAUAAGCUUGAUAUCGAAUUCCUGCAGCCCGCGUCG. For RNAP assays, nuclear extracts (120 μg for silver staining, 60 μg for Western blotting) were precleared with 0.5 μl of Ultralink-NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) per μg of extract at 4 °C for 45 min. Precleared extracts were incubated in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm pepstatin, 2 mm aprotinin, 2 mm leupeptin) with 1.2 μg of yeast tRNA and 4 units of RNase inhibitor (RNasin, Promega) per μg of extract at 30 °C for 10 min. 6.5 ng of biotinylated RNA oligonucleotide per μg of extract was added, and the reactions were further incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. After washing the beads four times with binding buffer without glycerol, precipitated complexes were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and either subjected to silver staining or transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) followed by Western blotting. Western blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures involving the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using either 1:1-diluted tissue culture supernatant of mAB104 hybridoma (ATCC CRL-2067), to detect SR proteins, or 1:1000-diluted ascites fluid of monoclonal antibodies 4B10 and 4F4 (kindly provided by Gideon Dreyfuss) to detect hnRNP A1 and hnRNP C proteins, respectively. For analysis of transiently expressed myc-tagged hnRNP A1 (in Fig.6 B) the monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) recognizing the human c-myc-epitope EQKLISEEDL was used, followed by ECL detection. The yeast three-hybrid analysis was performed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40uraMS2 (Mat a, ura3-52, leu2-3112, his3Δ200, trp1Δ1, ade2, LYS2::(LexA op)4-HIS3, ura3::(LexA-op)8-LacZ) carrying pLexA/MS2/Zeo (ZeocinR). This strain is derived from L40 coat described previously (35SenGupta D.J. Zhang B. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). All plasmids used were amplified in Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The hybrid-RNA expression constructs and the constructs expressing the transactivation-domain fusion proteins, or the transactivation domain only, were cotransformed into S. cerevisiae L40uraMS2 cells. Transformants were grown on synthetic complete medium (YC) lacking uracil, tryptophan, and histidine for selection of the URA3,TRP1, and HIS3 marker genes. Growing colonies were analyzed further for LacZ expression using a filter lift assay to detect β-galactosidase activity by X-gal staining (36Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We have previously identified exon sequences in CD44 variant exon 5 that account for exon inclusion or exon skipping in different cell lines and upon Ras signaling (29König H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The sequences form an exonic composite splice regulatory unit encompassing an exon recognition element and splice silencer elements in the 3′ (or right) part of the exon, R, and splice silencer domains in the 5′ (left) part, L, and in the middle portion, M, of the exon (29; see Fig.1 A). Both types of elements are necessary for regulated cell type-specific and -inducible inclusion of the exon. In a T-cell line equipped with a v5 exon-carrying minigene, concanavalin A, phorbol-ester tumor promoters, or expression of oncogenic p21Ras induced exon inclusion (29König H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To purify and identify nuclear proteins recognizing the exonic elements, we set up RNA-affinity precipitations (RNAP) using biotinylated RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the subdomains L, M, and R of the CD44 v5 regulatory splice unit (see Fig. 1 A). As a control for nonspecific binding to the matrix or for unspecific RNA binding, the oligonucleotide was omitted from the precipitation reaction, or precipitates were performed with a control oligonucleotide, “blue.” The blue oligonucleotide equals the L, M, and R oligonucleotides in length (42-mer) but is derived from an unrelated polylinker sequence (from the pBluescript vector, Stratagene). The blue sequence in place of either one of the regulatory subdomains in the CD44-v5 exon abolishes their regulatory effectsin vivo (29König H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Upon silver staining of the RNA-affinity precipitates separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 B), several protein bands were detectable that were specifically bound to the CD44 v5 exon sequences. Of these proteins, some bind to all three exon sequences (L, M, and R), whereas others bind only to one sequence (Fig. 1 B). In an approach to identify the proteins in the RNA-affinity precipitates, we screened the separated proteins by immunoblotting for the presence of two groups of proteins, which can affect splice site selection in mammalian cells: SR proteins and hnRNPs. Using an antibody recognizing a conserved phosphoepitope on all SR protein family members (mAb104 (37Roth M.B. Murphy C. Gall J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2217-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 38Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar)), we could not detect SR proteins in the precipitates (data not shown). The screen for hnRNP proteins, however, was successful. Although there were no hnRNP C proteins detectable in the precipitates (not shown), each of the three regulatory subdomains of the v5 exon, L, M, and R, were bound to hnRNP A1 (Fig. 1 C,lanes 3–5). No hnRNP A1 binding was detectable with the matrix alone (lane 1) or with the unrelated blue oligonucleotide (lane 2), suggesting a specific association of hnRNP A1 with the CD44 v5 exon sequences. To exclude that the interaction of hnRNP A1 with v5 sequences was merely an in vitro artifact, we employed a yeast three-hybrid system in which the binding of a bifunctional hybrid-RNA to each of two hybrid proteins activates transcription of reporter genes in yeast (35; see Fig.2 A). The yeast strain employed, L40uraMS2, contains a HIS3 gene and alacZ gene under the control of lexA-operator sites. In addition, it expresses the first hybrid protein in which the bacterial LexA DNA-binding domain is fused to the coat protein of the bacteriophage MS2 that recognizes an RNA-stem loop structure in MS2 RNA. For the expression of the second hybrid protein we generated a construct (pYESTrp2-A1) that gives rise to an hnRNP A1 protein fused to the B42 transcriptional transactivation domain. As hybrid-RNA supposed to bridge the two fusion proteins, we used the entire CD44 v5 exon sequence plus approximately 30 bp of upstream and downstream intron sequences fused to two tandemly repeated bacteriophage-MS2 RNA recognition sites (pRH5′-v5). A construct in which the v5 exon sequence (except for the four 5′-most and the three 3′-most nucleotides) had been replaced for a pBluescript-polylinker sequence, served as a negative control (pRH5′-blue). Co-transformation of the MS2-v5 hybrid-RNA-encoding plasmid and the B42-hnRNP A1 expression construct (pRH5′-v5+pYESTrp2-A1) resulted in L40uraMS2 yeast cells, which could grow on histidine-deficient plates (Fig. 2 B) and which expressed LacZ, as shown by X-gal staining (Fig. 2 C). The result resembled that obtained using the positive control: MS2-IRE (iron responsive element) hybrid-RNA and B42-IRP (iron regulatory protein) fusion protein (pRH3′-IRE+pYESTrp2-IRP; Fig. 2, Band C). In contrast, co-transformation with the empty B42-expression vector and the MS2-v5 hybrid-RNA construct failed to give rise to cells that could grow in the absence of histidine and that expressed LacZ (pRH5′-v5+pYESTrp2; Fig. 2, B andC). Similarly, co-transformation of the B42-hnRNP A1 expression construct together with the control hybrid-RNA construct, in which the v5 sequence had been replaced by the Bluescript-polylinker sequence, failed to generate HIS prototrophy or LacZ-positive cells (pRH5′-blue+pYESTrp2-A1; Fig. 2, B and C). The results indicate that activation of the yeast reporter genes was dependent on the presence of both the B42-hnRNP A1 fusion and the CD44 v5 exon sequences in the hybrid-RNA, strongly suggesting that hnRNP A1 interacted with v5 exon sequences in vivo. To examine whether the interaction of hnRNP A1 with CD44 exon v5 was functionally relevant, we transiently overexpressed hnRNP A1 and determined the behavior of a CD44 v5-minigene splice reporter. The minigene construct contains the murine CD44-v5 exon and adjacent intron sequences between pre-proinsulin exons 2 and 3 and their corresponding intron sequences. This construct had previously been shown to recapitulate cell type-specific and -inducible alternative splicing of the endogenous CD44-v5 exon (29König H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because hnRNP A1 is an abundant protein in most cell types (39Kamma H. Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we reasoned that it could be difficult to achieve overexpression. We therefore used the mouse erythroleukemia cell line CB3, which, due to loss of one hnRNP A1 allele and a proviral integration 3′ to the coding sequence of the second allele, shows no detectable expression of hnRNP A1 protein (30, 40; and Fig.3 A). After cotransfection of the v5 minigene (for scheme, see Fig. 3 B) with the empty expression vector, the majority of the minigene-derived mRNA included CD44 exon v5 (indicated by the larger PCR product of 361 bp; Fig. 3 C, lane 1). Cotransfection with increasing amounts of an hnRNP A1 expression vector, however, led to exon skipping in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2 and 3). An expression construct carrying the hnRNP A1 cDNA in antisense orientation did not repress v5 exon inclusion (Fig. 3 C, lane 4), suggesting that expression of hnRNP A1 protein is required for splice silencing. Expression of the antisense cDNA reproducibly enhanced v5 exon inclusion slightly. This result could be explained by the residual expression of hnRNP A1 mRNA in CB3 cells (40Yang X. Bani M.R. Lu S.J. Rowan S. Ben-David Y. Chabot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, inhibition of CD44 v5 exon inclusion by hnRNP A1 was not confined to the hnRNP A1-deficient CB3 erythroleukemia cells but could also be shown in NIH-3T3 murine fibroblasts and in KLN205 mouse carcinoma cells. Although endogenous hnRNP A1 was easily detectable in both cell lines (see Fig.3 A), they showed predominantly inclusion of exon v5 in the minigene mRNA in the absence of additional hnRNP A1 (Fig.3 D, lanes 1 and 3). Transient overexpression of hnRNP A1 shifted the splice pattern to skipping of the v5 exon (Fig. 3 D, lanes 2 and 4). To estimate the level of hnRNP A1 overexpression, we transfected NIH-3T3 cells with an epitope-tagged version of hnRNP A1. By Western blotting of cell extracts using an anti-hnRNP A1 antibody, we could determine the amount of epitope-tagged hnRNP A1 (which has a higher molecular weight due to the epitope tag) to be 35% of the endogenous hnRNP A1 level (data not shown). Taking into account the transfection efficiency of the cells under these conditions (13% cells transfected), it can be estimated that there is an approximately 3-fold overexpression of hnRNP A1 in the transfected cells. The repression of exon inclusion by overexpressed hnRNP A1 suggests that the endogenous levels of hnRNP A1 (and/or its functional state) in the two cell lines do not suffice for repression of v5 exon usage in the minigene pre-mRNA and that repression of CD44 v5 exon inclusion by overexpression of hnRNP A1 is not a peculiarity of the CB3 erythroleukemia cells. Using different combinations of variant exons, a multitude of variant CD44 isoforms can be generated under physiological conditions and in cancer (21Sherman L. Sleeman J. Dall P. Hekele A. Moll J. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 213: 249-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To assess whether hnRNP A1 is a general silencer of variant CD44 exons, or whether it regulates the usage of certain variant exons selectively, we used similar minigene constructs carrying either one of three other CD44 variant exons. When testing their splice patterns under the influence of hnRNP A1, inclusion of exon v6 was repressed similarly to exon v5 (Fig.4, lanes 1 and 2, and lanes 5 and 6) whereas inclusion of exons v4 (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4) and v7 (Fig. 4,lanes 7 and 8) were not, indicating that hnRNP A1 does not cause general skipping of variant exon sequences. Rather, hnRNP A1-mediated splice silencing is exon-specific. HnRNP A1 could be shown to associate with RNA sequences of CD44 exon v5 in vitro andin vivo (see Figs. 1 and 2). Moreover, hnRNP A1 can be cross-linked by UV irradiation to these sequences (data not shown). Thus, exon specificity in hnRNP A1-dependent splice silencing could be the result of sequence preference in RNA binding of hnRNP A1 itself or of an hnRNP A1-containing protein complex. To verify that exon silencing of the v5 exon by hnRNP A1 depended on the exon sequences to which it binds in vitro, we made use of minigene constructs containing mutant v5 exons. In the mutants, either the L or M exonic silencer subdomains or both had been replaced by blue polylinker sequences of the same length (29; see Fig.5 A). HnRNP A1 did not bind to the polylinker sequences either in vitro or in vivo (see Figs. 1 and 2). When we cotransfected the minigene constructs into NIH-3T3 cells together with the empty expression plasmid, the mutant v5 exon sequences were included in the minigene mRNA to a slightly higher level than with the wild-type v5 exon (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 1, 3,5, and 7). However, whereas cotransfection of the hnRNP A1 expression vector repressed inclusion of the wild-type v5 exon by 50.5% (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and 2), inclusion of the L and M mutants was affected only by 9.4% and 22.4%, respectively (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3–6) and remained virtually unaffected in the L/M double mutant v5bls7 (Fig.5 B, lanes 7 and 8). Thus, exon silencing by hnRNP A1 required the specific sequences in v5 subdomains L and M. As shown in Fig. 1 B above, subdomain"

BAH appears to be a type 2 integral membrane protein containing a short amino-terminal domain that projects into the cytoplasm. The amino-terminal domain is followed by a predicted transmembrane domain and a highly charged region that projects into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The COOH-terminal region of BAH, which corresponds to the 52- and 56-kDa polypeptides isolated from bovine liver, contains the aspartyl hydroxylase catalytic domain. This domain contains dibasic glycine and His2 motifs that have been shown to be critical for catalytic activity (13Jia S. McGinnis K. VanDusen W.J. Burke C.J. Kuo A. Griffin P.R. Sardana M.K.

Northern blotting of bovine liver mRNA with a 5′ bovineBAH cDNA probe revealed two mRNA species of ∼2.6 and 6.6 kb (12Jia S. VanDusen W.J. Diehl R.E. Kohl N.E. Dixon R.A.F. Elliston K.O. Stern A.M.

More recently, a 4.3-kb cDNA isolated by immunoscreening against highly expressed antigens in a human osteosarcoma cDNA expression library led to observations of two transcripts (2.6 and 4.3 kb) in a Northern analysis of eight human tissues (14Korioth F. Gieffers C. Frey J. Gene ( Amst .). 1994; 150: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At the time, the identity of the small (∼2.6-kb) transcript was unknown and was thought to represent an alternative splicing event of the BAH gene (14Korioth F. Gieffers C. Frey J. Gene ( Amst .). 1994; 150: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The larger transcript encodes a 757-amino acid protein with a predicted mass of 85 kDa. Interestingly, in vitro translation of the full-length cDNA yielded a band on Western blots migrating at 107 kDa (14Korioth F. Gieffers C. Frey J. Gene ( Amst .). 1994; 150: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Western analysis of human BAH from a variety of human cancer cell lines identified protein bands with masses ranging from 50 to 120 kDa (16Lavaissier L. Jia S. Nishiyama M. de la Monte S. Stern A.M. Wands J.R. Friedman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting that smaller forms represent proteolytic degradation products of the full-length protein. In order to better understand the organization and regulation ofBAH, we have cloned and characterized the BAHgenomic locus. Three major RNA forms of BAH-related sequences were cloned and analyzed. In addition to the full-length murine BAH cDNA, a novel, alternatively spliced, transcript was obtained. This transcript (humbug) encodes a protein identical to BAH through the NH2-terminal half of the protein, but completely lacks the catalytic domain of BAH. The genomic organization of BAH is described, and the transcription start site is mapped. Monoclonal antibody reagents that allow specific recognition of the catalytically active version of human BAH were produced, characterized, and used to definitively assign bands observed on Northern blots to those observed on Western blots from human tumor cells. A short region of homology between canine junctin, a 28-kDa calsequestrin-binding protein found in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and bovine BAH has been previously described (17Jones L.R. Zhang L.

To understand the relationship between BAH, humbug, and junctin, a mousejunctin cDNA was cloned from a mouse heart library and the sequence compared with that for BAH andhumbug. Mouse BAH, humbug, andjunctin were found to be identical in sequence over the 220 nucleotides spanning BAH exons 2 and 3. Further genomic analysis revealed three additional junctin exons contained within theBAH genomic locus. Analysis of mouse heart RNA definitively demonstrated that BAH/humbug is expressed as a chimera that results in fusion of the amino-terminal half of junctin to the lumenal domain of BAH/humbug. A possible function of this unusual chimera is discussed. A 580-bp fragment representing a partial murine BAH cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR using murine liver cDNA and primers designed from bovineBAH (12Jia S. VanDusen W.J. Diehl R.E. Kohl N.E. Dixon R.A.F.

The resulting clone was used to screen a murine liver cDNA library (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 5′ end of mouse BAH was amplified from a liver cDNA library using PCR primers designed from murine BAH and the library vector. 5′- and 3′-RACE were performed using commercially available systems as described by the manufacturers (LifeTechnologies, Inc.; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Sequences were analyzed using Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) and the GCG sequence analysis package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Drosophila β-aspartyl hydroxylase sequences were obtained by EST data base searching and degenerate PCR using cDNA from embryo. Primers were designed from the human, bovine, and Caenorhabditis elegans sequences; optimum PCR amplification was seen with a degenerate sense primer (CARAGRTCNCTNTAYAA) and an antisense primer designed usingDrosophila codon frequencies (CTCGTGCTCGAAGGAATCATC). A full-length cDNA was assembled by 5′- and 3′-RACE utilizing primers designed from the degenerate PCR products and ESTs. Splice variants were assessed by RT-PCR. A 129/SvJ ES cell BAC library was screened by both hybridization and PCR (InCyte Genomics, St. Louis, MO). cDNA sequences encoding the catalytic domain were used as a hybridization probe. PCR screening relied on primers from the 5′-UTR of the mouse cDNA. Three overlapping BAC clones containing the entire murine BAH gene were shotgun-subcloned essentially as described (19Povinelli C.M. Gibbs R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using nebulized BAC DNA. Shotgun clones containing coding regions were identified by hybridization using radiolabeled full-length cDNA. Vector primers were used to sequence coding region clones from both directions, with the sequence being assembled and analyzed using Sequencher (Gene Codes). In addition, specific restriction fragments from the BACs were subcloned and sequenced using the Primer Island transposition kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Murine junctin sequences were obtained from heart cDNA by RT-PCR using a sense primer designed from the 5′ end of the dog junctin open reading frame (17Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and an antisense primer containing thejunctin-like sequences from murine BAH. Primers were designed from this initial RT-PCR product for use in RACE, with the full-length sequence for murine junctin assembled using overlapping 5′- and 3′-RACE products. Southern analysis was used to map the mouse junctin sequences on the murine BACs containing the BAH locus. Appropriate fragments were subcloned and sequenced as described above. Northern blots containing total RNA and mRNA were hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes following standard protocols (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Real time PCR was performed essentially as described (20Gibson U.E. Heid C.A.

Primers and probes designed from the mouseBAH and junctin sequences were synthesized and purified by Biosearch Technologies, Inc. (Novato, CA). All probes, with the exception of the 18 S rRNA probe, were modified at the 5′ end with the reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein-aminohexylamidite, and at the 3′ end with the quencher dye 6-carboxytetramethyl rhodamine (Biosearch Technologies Inc.). The 5′ end of the 18 S rRNA probe was modified with VIC (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For detection of BAH exon 19/20, primers ACCCTGGCACGGATGATG and AAGTTCATACCACTTATATGCCTCTTTG and probe 5′-TTCCCGACCCTCTGCATGGCA were used. For BAH exon 14a, primers GGAATTCAGGGTGTATGAGAAACAG and CCAGTGTATAAAGGAAGAGGCTCATC and probe CCCAGAGTTTGCTGCTGGGTCCAA were used. For mouse junctin, primers ACCCATCAAAGAAGAGCTGAAGA and TCCTCCCCTTCCCTCTATCC and probe CCCTGCCTTCGCTCTTCATTCTTGCT were used. For 18 S rRNA, primers CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA and GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT and probe TGCTGGCACCAGACTTGCCCTC were used. Total RNA was prepared from murine tissues using the RNeasy purification system (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed with the Advantage RT-PCR kit (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer's instructions using random hexamers and 1 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA. Taqman-based real time PCR expression profiling was performed using 25 ng of each cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems) with real-time fluorescence being monitored with an ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression levels of the various transcripts were determined essentially as described (20Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). Briefly, standard curves were generated for each transcript using a serial dilution of mouse heart cDNA. Relative abundance was then determined by comparing the cycle threshold values for each reaction with this standard curve. Abundance levels calculated from negative control reactions performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase were then subtracted from experimental sample abundance. Input levels of cDNA were normalized to 18 S rRNA levels. All expression measurements were performed in duplicate using two independently generated cDNA samples. Recombinant human aspartyl β-hydroxylase 52-kDa catalytic fragment (11Wang Q. VanDusen W.J. Petroski C.J. Garsky V.M. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. J. Biol.

Purified protein was used to prepare monoclonal antibodies in the mouse by conventional techniques (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Two of these antibodies (HBOH-1 and HBOH-2) were characterized and used for Western analysis of human cell lines. Monoclonal antibodies HBOH-1 and HBOH-2 were biotin-labeled using NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) as follows. Approximately 50 μg of antibody were incubated with 2 μl of 3.9 mm NHS-LC-biotin in PBS buffer. After 2 h, 1 ml of 1 m ethanolamine was added to block unreacted biotin reagent. To minimize losses during washing, 20 μl of 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were added and the labeled antibody washed three times with 2 ml of PBS using a Centricon concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a 30-kDa cut-off. Phage displayed peptide libraries encoding seven or eight random amino acids (23, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) were screened to identify peptide-binding phage as follows. One microgram of biotinylated antibody was incubated with approximately 1011plaque-forming units of the library at 4 °C overnight. The phage antibody mixture was incubated for 10 min on streptavidin-coated dishes (0.5 mg/ml in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.0) that had been blocked with bovine serum albumin (29 mg/ml in 0.1 mNaHCO3). Plates were washed 10 times with 3 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 over 30 min. Bound phage were eluted with glycine buffer, pH 2.2, neutralized with 2m Tris, and titered for plaque-forming units on XL-1 Blue. Neutralized phage were amplified by infection of XL-1 Blue E. coli and used for additional rounds of selection. After three rounds of selection, individual plaques were picked and amplified to recover DNA for sequencing. FB-50 was the kind gift of Dr. Jack R. Wands (16Lavaissier L. Jia S.

A set of 90 peptides comprising the region between residues 82 and 354 of human BAH (16Lavaissier L. Jia S. Nishiyama M. de la Monte S. Stern A.M. Wands J.R. Friedman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes (Raleigh, NC). The fifteen residue peptides were synthesized covalently attached to pins to facilitate antibody screening in a 96-well format. The pins were used according to the manufacturer's instructions to identify peptide fragment(s) recognized by the antibodies in question. Oligonucleotides for antisense experiments were synthesized and purified using protocols previously described (24Ho S.-P. Britton D.H. Stone B.A. Behrens D.A. Leffet L.M. Hobbs F.W. Miller J.A. Trainor G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1901-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A549 cells were plated at a density of 5.5 × 105 cells/6-cm plate and cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin, for 24 h. The following day, the oligonucleotides (0.4 μm final concentration) were mixed with lipofectin (20 μg/ml final concentration, Life Technologies, Inc.) and the cells were incubated with this complex for 4 h. The oligonucleotide-lipofectin complex was washed off, and fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added to the cells. A second addition of the complex was carried out 48 h later. Cells were harvested for Western analysis 24 h after this second addition and resuspended in SDS lysis/gel-loading buffer to a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml buffer. Five μl of lysate solution was fractionated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 100 V in Tris-glycine buffer. Protein was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electrotransfer and probed with primary antibody (FB-50 or HBOH-1 at 1:5000 and 1:500 dilutions, respectively) at 4 °C overnight. Secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were applied according to manufacturer's instructions. Detection was accomplished using the Renaissance® Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Previous Northern analyses of human and bovine RNAs have demonstrated that multiple RNA species containBAH-related sequences (12Jia S. VanDusen W.J. Diehl R.E. Kohl N.E. Dixon R.A.F. Elliston K.O.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To clarify the relationship of BAH to these transcripts, a detailed RNA, cDNA, and genomic analysis of the murine BAH gene was undertaken. Northern analysis of poly(A)+ RNAs derived from multiple mouse tissues probed with a murine BAH cDNA, which includes the BAH intralumenal domain (probe A, Fig. 1 D), demonstrated the presence of three different size transcripts (2.8, 4.5 and 6.6 kb). These transcripts are expressed in a wide variety of normal murine tissues (Fig. 1 A). Seven BAH cDNA clones were isolated from a murine liver cDNA library. The largest clone included a polyadenylation signal and extended 5′ to include the transmembrane region of BAH, but stopped short of the translation start site. 5′-RACE was used to isolate a complete open reading frame forBAH and to define the transcription start site ofBAH, 174 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon (Fig. 1 D, 1). This full-length clone is 4,419 bp in length (GenBank™ accession no. AF289486) and is consistent with the middle transcript band detected in the Northern analysis. To examine the 3′ end of the BAH transcript, a 3′-RACE experiment was performed, priming from the 3′-UTR mouse BAH clone. Fragments isolated from this RACE experiment identified a second class of transcript which terminated after a second polyadenylation signal 6,629 bp downstream from the transcription start site (Fig. 1 D, 2, accession no. AF289487). This transcript is consistent with the largest size transcript, 6.6 kb, identified by Northern analysis. Both the 4.5- and 6.6-kb clones are identical in sequence through the cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane region, highly charged region and catalytic domain. They share a common 3′-UTR up to the first polyadenylation signal at 4.5 kb. The longer clone extends the 3′-UTR for another 2.1 kb until it terminates at a second polyadenylation signal. Characterization of additional murine BAH related cDNA clones identified a class whose homology with the full-lengthBAH clone terminated 1,094 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 1 D, 3, accession no. AF289488). This cDNA is consistent in size with the smallest (2.8 kb) transcript identified on the mouse tissue Northern blots (Fig. 1, A and D (3)). Comparison of the sequence of this truncated clone to BAH revealed that they are identical in the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, and diverge near the beginning of the BAH catalytic domain. The coding sequence of the truncated clone terminates at a stop codon two amino acids downstream of the break in identity (Fig. 2). This truncated form of theBAH transcript (humbug) does not include the catalytic domain and therefore is predicted to be catalytically inactive as an aspartyl hydroxylase.Figure 2Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of human, mouse, bovine, and Drosophila BAH. The putative TM region is overlined. Potential glycosylation sites are marked by asterisks above the human sequence. The epitopes of monoclonal antibodies FB-50, HBOH-1, and HBOH-2 are indicated. Arrowheads mark the putative NH2 terminus of the processed 52- and 56-kDa forms of bovine BAH. The His2 and dibasic Gly (DBG) motifs are indicated. Residues that are identical between all four species are shaded in black, and those with identity between only two or three species are shaded in gray. Arrows denote positions of the C termini in the truncated forms of the murine and human BAH (identical site and sequence) andDrosophila proteins, whereas the text followingarrows denotes COOH-terminal sequences that are unique to the truncated forms.

Northern blots of adult mouse liver RNA probed with a 5′ fragment (probe B) that is contained within all threeBAH-related transcripts (Fig. 1, B(lane 1) and C (lane 1)) identified all three bands (2.8, 4.5, and 6.6 kb) previously seen on Northern analysis (Fig. 1 A). Re-hybridization of this Northern with a BAH catalytic domain probe (probe C) recognized both of the larger transcripts (4.5 and 6.6 kb), but not the 2.8-kb band (Fig. 1 B,lane 2). In contrast, when the Northern blot depicted in Fig. 1 C (lane 1) was re-probed with a fragment from the 3′-UTR of the truncated clone (probe D), only the 2.8-kb transcript was identified (Fig. 1 C,lane 2). These results are consistent with the 2.8-kb transcript representing humbug, the truncated catalytically inactive form of BAH, and the two larger transcripts representing the full-length catalytically active version of BAH, differing only in their use of alternative polyadenylation signals. To determine if the catalytically inactive form of BAH (humbug) exists in humans, 3′-RACE was performed on a human liver cDNA library using a primer chosen from the highly charged region of human BAH. A 2.8-kb human ortholog of mouse humbug was obtained (accession no.AF289489). The deduced amino acid sequences of the mouse and humanhumbug transcripts indicate that protein truncation occurs at the identical position, 2 amino acids downstream of the break in homology with the full-length BAH sequence (Fig. 2). With the identification of a major alternatively splicedhumbug transcript in the mouse and human, and the knowledge that BAH activity has previously been demonstrated in insect cells (25Monkovic D.D. VanDusen W.J. Petroski C.J. Garsky V.M. Sardana M.K. Zavodszky P. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the existence of humbug in Drosophila was explored.Drosophila BAH sequences were obtained by degenerate PCR, EST data base searching, and 5′- and 3′-RACE. Two different cDNAs were identified. The first contained a contiguous open reading frame of 2,358 bp (786 amino acids) that included a putative cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane domain, a highly charged region, and a catalytic domain. The second cDNA, however, encoded a truncated open reading frame of 1149 bp (383 amino acids) whose structure and sequence are consistent with it being the Drosophila ortholog of humbug (Figs. 4 C and 2, accession nos. AF289493 and AF289494). Previously, a cross-species comparison of bovine BAH and dog junctin has shown that these genes share 95% amino acid identity over a 73-residue region, which includes the putative transmembrane domain of BAH (17Jones L.R.

Biochemical analysis revealed a limited proteolytic processing, which detaches the N-terminal heparin-binding domain from the rest of the molecule and confirmed the importance of the heptad-repeat domain for pentamerization. In electron microscopy the uncleaved TSP-4 was seen as a large central particle to which five smaller globules are attached by elongated linker regions. Binding of TSP-4 to collagens and to non-collagenous proteins could be detected in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-style ligand binding assays, by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and in rotary shadowing electron microscopy. Although the binding of TSP-4 to solid-phase collagens was enhanced by Zn2+, that to non-collagenous proteins was not. The interactions of TSP-4 with both classes of proteins are mediated by C-terminal domains of the TSP-4 subunits but do not require an oligomeric structure. Major binding sites for TSP-4 are located in or close to the N- and C-terminal telopeptides in collagen I, but additional sites are detected in more central regions of the molecule.

All TSPs except COMP also contain an N-terminal heparin-binding domain, and TSP-1 and TSP-2, in addition, contain procollagen-like domains and properdin-like TSP type I domains. Although TSP-1 and -2 form trimers via their coiled-coil domains, TSP-3, TSP-4, and COMP form pentameric coiled coils. TSP-1 is the best characterized family member. It is found in blood platelets but also in the extracellular matrix formed by many cell types. It has been proposed to bind other matrix proteins, proteolytic enzymes, growth factors, and cellular receptors (for review see Ref.10Adams J.C. Int. J. Biochem.

Using a polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the C-terminal domain, they could detect TSP-4 in the interstitial cells in both skeletal and heart muscle. The expression of TSP-4 was elevated after denervation of skeletal muscle, with the signal intensity increasing specifically in the interstitial cells. Using in situ hybridization as well as immunofluorescence localization of TSP-4 combined with α-bungarotoxin labeling, they could show that TSP-4-expressing cells were in the immediate vicinity of the neuromuscular junction. In addition, the expression of TSP-4 by a variety of neuronal cells was detected, andin vitro assays showed that TSP-4 possesses a neurite outgrowth-promoting activity (20Arber S. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our identification of TSP-4 as an abundant non-collagenous protein in tendon extracellular matrix (21Hauser N. Paulsson M. Kale A.A. DiCesare P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether TSP-4 plays a role in extracellular matrix structure and assembly. In the present work we have recombinantly expressed full-length and truncated forms of TSP-4 in mammalian cells, characterized their structure, and used them in interaction studies to demonstrate that TSP-4 binds with high affinity to both collagenous and non-collagenous extracellular matrix proteins via its C-terminal region and that the former interaction is enhanced by Zn2+ ions. Total RNA was isolated from the skin of 4-day-old rats by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed with Expand-Polymerase using the following primers: primer 1, 5′-TTAAACTAGTAGCGGGCGCCCAGGCCAC; primer 2, 5′-GTAAAGCTTCCAACACCGCACACACACG; primer 3, 5′-GCATGCGCAGTGCATTGAGG; primer 4, 5′-GCCAAGCTTAGAAGGCAGTTGTGAGATTGC; primer 5, 5′-GGACTAGTAAGTGAGCCGCTGGC; primer 6, 5′-TCAACATCAGTGCACACCTGC; primer 7, 5′-GGACTAGTACCTCTCAGCTTCCAG; primer 8, 5′-AAGTCAGTCGACTCATTAGCCACAAGCCTGGCACTCAGC; primer 9, 5′-TTGCGGCCGCTCATTACTGCTGCAGGAAACAGTCTTGTAGG. cDNA encoding the recombinant full-length TSP-4 was obtained by ligation of two shorter cDNAs amplified with the primer pairs 1/2 and 3/4, respectively, over a common FspI site in pCRII (Invitrogen). Fragment NT+CC was obtained with the primer pair 1/8 and NT with the pair 1/9. The cDNAs for CT and CT+CC were based on that for the full-length protein. For both fragments only the 5′-end was changed by using the primer pair 5/6 for CT+CC and 7/6 for CT. The primer combinations introduced a novel SpeI site at the 5′-end and a stop codon, a NotI or a BamHI site, respectively, at the 3′-end. The products were restriction-digested with NheI and NotI/BamHI and, after purification by agarose gel electrophoresis, were inserted in-frame with the BM40 signal peptide in the expression vector pCEP-Pu (24Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) digested with the same enzymes. DNA sequencing was performed on the ALF- express DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Cy5TM Auto Read sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant plasmids were introduced by electroporation into the human embryonic kidney cell line 293-EBNA (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin and grown to confluency. Secretion of full-length or truncated forms of TSP-4 into the medium was confirmed by comparison in SDS-PAGE of medium samples from transfected and wild-type cells. For purification of the full-length protein, serum-free culture medium was dialyzed against 2 murea, 75 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and applied to a column of DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted with a gradient of 75–500 mm NaCl. TSP-4-containing fractions were pooled, applied to a molecular sieve column of Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 75 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Final purification and concentration was achieved through binding of TSP-4 to a column of heparin-Sepharose CL6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the same buffer and stepwise elution with 0.3 m NaCl. The TSP-4 fragments CT and CT+CC were purified in an analogous manner, but because they lack the heparin-binding domain, final concentration was achieved by stepwise elution from a small column of DEAE-Sepharose FF. For the analogous purification of the smaller and more basic fragments NT and NT+CC, an ion exchanger of SP-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a molecular sieve of Sephadex G-75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. The purity and size of all purified proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE performed according to the protocol of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with or without prior reduction of disulfide bonds. Alternatively, full-length TSP-4 was isolated from cell culture medium in the absence of 2 m urea but with 1.8 mmcalcium chloride added to all buffers. Anion exchange and heparin affinity chromatographies were otherwise performed as described above. Final pools were dialyzed against TBS containing 1.8 mmcalcium (TBS-Ca). To analyze the effect of urea, TSP-4 purified in the presence of calcium was dialyzed extensively against 2 murea in the absence of calcium. The urea was then removed by dialysis against TBS-Ca. For visualization of complexes by rotary shadowing electron microscopy, full-length TSP-4, COMP, and collagen I were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.2 mammonium formate, containing 1 mm ZnCl2. When desired Na2EDTA was added to a final concentration of 5 mm followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. After addition of a 4-fold molar surplus of collagen I to the TSP-4 or COMP samples, the mixtures were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The samples were diluted 1:1 with 80% glycerol, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, dried in vacuum, and rotary-shadowed with platinum/carbon (26Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The replicas were floated off onto distilled water, picked up on 400-mesh copper grids, and examined in a Zeiss EM 902A electron microscope. Rat COMP was prepared recombinantly using EBNA 293 cells in a manner analogous to the preparation of TSP-4. 2J. Thur and P. Maurer, unpublished results. TSP-4 was also subjected to negative staining using 0.75% uranyl formate. All collagens used in ligand binding assays were purchased from Sigma. They had been isolated after pepsin digestion from the following tissues: collagen I from calf skin, collagen II from bovine tracheal cartilage, and collagens III, IV, and V from human placenta. Each collagen was dissolved in 0.1 macetic acid, pH 2.5. Murine laminin-1 (27Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5425-5430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine fibronectin (28Miekka S.I. Ingham K.C. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), human BM40, 3B. Kaufmann and P. Maurer, unpublished results. and murine matrilin-2 (29Piecha D. Muratoglu S.

Polyclonal antibodies specific for TSP-4 were generated at Eurogentec (Belgium) by immunizing rabbits with full-length TSP-4 and the TSP-4 fragment NT, respectively. The antiserum against TSP-4 was affinity-purified on a column of TSP-4 Sepharose CL4B prepared by CNBr coupling. Additionally, antisera against murine laminin-1, bovine fibronectin, human BM40, and murine matrilin-2 were raised in rabbits. Collagens were biotinylated for detection (30Meier T. Arni S. Malarkanna S. Poincelet M. Hoessli D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Inital ligand binding studies were performed in solid phase assays either with TSP-4 proteins as soluble ligands or coated to plastic. 96-well plates (Maxisorb, NUNC) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml collagens I, II, III, IV, and V, laminin-1, fibronectin, BM40, matrilin-2, or TSP-4 proteins. The collagens were coated from 0.5m acetic acid and the non-collagenous proteins from 0.15m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (TBS). After rinsing with 0.04% Tween 20 in TBS for 1 h, the wells were blocked with 200 μl of 1 mg/ml ovalbumin in TBS at room temperature. After rinsing as above, the coated wells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 10 μg/ml TSP-4 diluted in TBS containing either 1.25 mm CaCl2, 0.22 mmZnCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 0,02 mm MnCl2, or 10 mm EDTA. In separate experiments the zinc concentration was varied between 0 and 1 mm. For dose-response curves full-length TSP-4 was added at different concentrations between 0 and 4 μg/ml. Bound full-length TSP-4 and the recombinant fragments CT and CT+CC were detected using the polyclonal antibodies against full-length TSP-4. For the detection of the N-terminal TSP-4 fragments, the polyclonal antibodies against the fragment NT were used. The BIAcore 2000 biosensor system (BIAcore, Sweden) was used to further characterize the interactions between TSP-4 and other extracellular matrix proteins. Immobilization of proteins to the CM5 sensor chip was achieved byN-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccimide coupling procedure at a flow of 5 μl/min. The surface of the carboxymethylated sensor chip was activated by addition of 40 μl of 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccimide, 0.2 m N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride solution. TSP-4 (100 μg/ml) was coupled to the activated chip in 0.15 m sodium chloride, 10 mmsodium citrate, pH 3.2, for 8 min. The residual activated esters of the surface were deactivated by blocking with 1 m ethanolamine in 0.1 m sodium hydrogen carbonate, pH 5.3. One surface on each chip was activated and deactivated under identical conditions without coupling a protein and was used as a blank. Collagens or laminin-1 (10 μg/ml in TBS containing 0.5 mmZnCl2) were pumped over the TSP-4 sensor chip at a flow rate of 80 μl/min for 2 min. In separate experiments the concentration of collagen I was varied between 2.5 and 10 μg/ml. For other experiments collagens (100 μg/ml) were coupled on an activated sensor chip from 0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Similarly, laminin-1 (100 μg/ml) was coupled from 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0. Deactivation was performed as above. Binding of full-length TSP-4 (50 μg/ml) and fragment CT (25 μg/ml) as soluble ligands to surfaces with immobilized collagens or laminin-1 were performed at a flow of 50 μl/min. The BIAevaluation version 2.1 software was used to calculate dissociation constants. RNA was isolated from the skin of 4-day-old rats, and cDNA coding for TSP-4 was synthesized by reverse transcription. The primers used were based on the sequence derived from rat brain (20Arber S. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which lacks the 5′-region coding for the signal peptide. For this reason the amplified sequence started with the N-terminal, heparin-binding domain of TSP-4. Two overlapping cDNAs with lengths of 1305 and 1617 base pairs were amplified and ligated to obtain the full-length cDNA for TSP-4. Sequencing revealed four discrepancies to the published sequence of rat TSP-4 (20Arber S. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A deletion of three nucleotides1308GGC1310 and two single nucleotide alterations G1961 → C and C1978 → T occurred in our sequence. These changes were confirmed by repeated cDNA synthesis and sequencing. The deletion is also found in sequences for TSP-4 previously determined for X. laevis and humans (6Lawler J. Duquette M. Whittaker C.A. Adams J.C. McHenry K. DeSimone D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19Lawler J. McHenry K. Duquette M. Derick L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2809-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The single base changes produced nucleotide triplets encoding amino acid residues conserved at these sites in other species. Similarly, the sequence 1311GCG1313 instead of GAC was found repeatedly and appeared plausible, because it is identical with that in X. laevis and conserves the acidic nature of the amino acid residue coded for in the human sequence. A silent mutation G1115 → T was not further investigated. The full-length and four truncated cDNAs were inserted into the pCEP-Pu vector, utilizing the signal sequence of BM40 (24Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The constructs represented the full-length TSP-4 (TSP-4), the C-terminal domains together with the α-helical coiled-coil region (CT+CC), the C-terminal domains alone (CT), the N-terminal heparin-binding domain together with the coiled-coil region (NT+CC), and the N-terminal heparin-binding domain (NT) (Fig. 1). The plasmids were introduced into the human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cell line, where they were stably maintained in episomal form. The secreted recombinant proteins were purified chromatographically from serum-free culture media. All proteins were purified in a buffer containing 2m urea to increase solubility and purification yields. To demonstrate that the use of 2 m urea does not cause irreversible structural or functional changes, smaller amounts of the full-length TSP-4 were purified by a procedure avoiding all potentially denaturing agents and retaining divalent cations. All recombinant proteins were analyzed by automated amino acid sequencing, and in each case yielded a major sequence confirming the expected cleavage of the BM40 signal peptide. The TSP-4 proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2). In each case the reduced protein product, when compared with reference proteins of known mass, yielded a molecular mass equal to or somewhat higher than that predicted from the amino acid sequence (Fig. 2 B). The full-length TSP-4 gave a major band at 135 kDa and a minor one at 120 kDa. When not reduced, those proteins containing the coiled-coil domain migrated to positions compatible with the expected pentameric structure (Fig. 2 A).Figure 1Domain structure of the full-length TSP-4 and of the recombinant fragments produced.

The particles seen were comparatively homogenous with most showing up to five small globules extending via a thinner segment from a central accumulation of mass. Based on the proposed structure of TSP-4 (19Lawler J. McHenry K. Duquette M. Derick L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2809-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), each of the small external globules corresponds to the C-terminal part of one subunit and the central mass is made up by the five N-terminal heparin-binding domains, which are held at close distance from each other by the coiled coil and are not individually resolved. The accumulation of stain at the center of the particles was more extensive than in earlier images of bovine TSP-4 (21Hauser N. Paulsson M. Kale A.A. DiCesare P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A variety of purified extracellular matrix proteins were coated to plastic and after saturation of free binding sites, a solution of 10 μg/ml of full-length recombinant TSP-4 was incubated in the wells. Bound TSP-4 was detected by use of a specific antiserum raised against the full-length protein. The panel of potential ligands was chosen to include collagens I–V as well as laminin-1, fibronectin, matrilin-2, and BM40 as examples for non-collagenous proteins. All these proteins show an at least partial codistribution with TSP-4 as determined by immunohistochemistry on sections of mouse tissues. 4L. Narouz-Ott, unpublished results. Interactions were detected with all proteins in the panel with the exception of collagen IV and BM40 for which only low or insignificant binding was seen at the concentrations used (Fig. 4). Because many extracellular matrix proteins, including COMP with its close structural relationship to TSP-4 (17Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), are known to have specific requirements for divalent cations when binding ligands, the assay was performed in the presence of a variety of such ions. Zn2+enhanced binding of TSP-4 to collagens, in agreement with previous observations for COMP (17Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), whereas binding to non-collagenous proteins did not show a strong requirement for Zn2+ (Fig. 4) or other divalent cations that were used at their physiological plasma concentrations. In further ELISA-style assays the binding of TSP-4 to the various collagens was determined in the presence of varying concentrations of Zn2+. A plateau of maximal binding was reached in the range of 0.1–0.5 mm (results not shown). The interaction between TSP-4 and collagen I was investigated in greater detail. Incubation of increasing concentrations of TSP-4 with immobilized collagen I in the presence of Zn2+ showed a saturable binding with an apparent K d of 2 nm (Fig. 5 A). Independent determination of the color yield of TSP-4 coated directly to plastic allowed estimation that, at half-saturation, 18% of all TSP-4 molecules added were bound to collagen I. A sample that had been purified in the absence of urea and in the presence of divalent cations, dialyzed into the buffer with 2 m urea used for most purifications, and then back into a physiological buffer, gave a binding curve identical to that obtained for TSP-4, which had never been exposed to urea (Fig. 5 A). For both kinds of samples, binding occurring in the presence of 1 mm Zn2+was abolished when this cation was removed and replaced by 1 mm Ca2+ or 1 mm EDTA (Fig.5 B). Collagens I–IV were assayed for binding to full-length TSP-4 that had been immobilized to a BIAcore CM5 sensor chip (Fig.6 A). The collagens were used at 10 μg/ml in a buffer containing 0.5 mmZn2+. Collagens I–III showed binding, in agreement with the ELISA-style binding assays, whereas collagen IV again showed no or only weak association. The dissociation was biphasic for all bound collagens. Dissociation rate constants k disswere separately fitted for the fast and slow phases. The resultingk diss values differed between the two phases by a factor of less than seven. This difference was correspondingly also found in the calculated equilibrium dissociation constantsK d. Different binding sites for TSP-4 are present on collagens (see below) and could be the reason for the biphasic dissociation. Nonetheless, we give mean K d values for the binding of TSP-4 to collagens, because other causes of biphasic dissociation cannot be excluded. Thus dissociation constants of 8.5 ± 6.5 nm for collagen I, 4.4 ± 3.0 nm for collagen II, and 38.5 ± 4.0 nm for collagen III were obtained.

MIS up-regulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 through an MIS type II receptor-mediated mechanism and inhibited growth in the absence of detectable or inactive Rb protein. Prolonged treatment with MIS down-regulated the Rb-related protein p130 and increased the Rb family-regulated transcription factor E2F1, overexpression of which inhibited growth. These findings demonstrate that p16 is required for MIS-mediated growth inhibition in ovarian epithelial cells and tumor cells and suggest that up-regulation of E2F1 also plays a role in this process.

In the absence of MIS, differentiation of the Müllerian duct into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina in female embryos occurs autonomously (1Teixeira J. Donahoe P.K. J. Androl. 1996; 17: 336-341PubMed Google Scholar). The 140-kDa MIS homodimer is enzymatically cleaved into two distinct fragments. The carboxyl-terminal fragment composed of a dimer with subunits of M r 12,500 retains bioactivity, whereas a noncleavable mutant is devoid of biological function (2Ragin R.C. Donahoe P.K. Kenneally M.K. Ahmad M.F. MacLaughlin D.T. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MIS is produced at high levels by Sertoli cells of the testis even after the regression of the Müllerian duct and decreases at adolescence. In females, it is synthesized by granulosa cells of the ovary. Measurement of circulating serum MIS levels in females indicates that MIS in females is produced postnatally, increases at the onset of puberty, and is undetectable at menopause (3Hudson P.L.

It is hypothesized that binding of MIS ligand to the MIS type II receptor, a serine threonine kinase (5Baarends W.M. van Helmond M.J. Post M. van der Schoot P.J. Hoogerbrugge J.W. de Winter J.P.

The MIS type II receptor gene contains 11 exons and encodes a 63-kDa protein, which is expressed at very high levels in the uterus, testis, and ovary (5Baarends W.M. van Helmond M.J.

Male mice that lack both alleles of the MIS type II receptor have a persistent Müllerian duct, which differentiates into a uterus and oviducts, a phenotype reminiscent of MIS ligand null mice (8Behringer R.R. Finegold M.J. Cate R.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Imbeaud et al. (9Imbeaud S. Belville C. Messika-Zeitoun L. Rey R. di Clemente N. Josso N.

Transgenic female mice that overexpress MIS ligand, demonstrate complete ablation of the ovary, along with undeveloped uterus and oviducts (10Behringer R.R. Cate R.L. Froelick G.J. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Nature. 1990; 345: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In male mice overexpression of MIS ligand leads to feminized genitalia, undescended testes, and a poorly differentiated Wolffian duct (10Behringer R.R. Cate R.L. Froelick G.J. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Nature. 1990; 345: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of MIS levels in the serum probably plays an important role in development of the ovary and masculinization of male reproductive organs. In addition to its significant role in sexual development, several lines of evidence suggest that MIS is a multifunctional hormone (11Catlin E.A. Tonnu V.C. Ebb R.G. Pacheco B.A. Manganaro T.F.

Because epithelial ovarian tumors originate from the surface epithelium of the ovary, which is also the origin of the Müllerian duct (14Scully R.E. Hum.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2101-2106PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Masiakos et al. (18Masiakos P.T. MacLaughlin D.T. Maheswaran S. Teixeira J. Fuller Jr., A.F. Shah P.C. Kehas D.J. Kenneally M.K. Dombkowski D.M. Ha T.U. Preffer F.I. Donahoe P.K. Clin.

To uncover the molecular mechanism by which MIS inhibits the growth of ovarian cancer cells, we analyzed the MIS-sensitive human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR 8, which expresses significant levels of MIS type II receptor (18Masiakos P.T. MacLaughlin D.T. Maheswaran S. Teixeira J. Fuller Jr., A.F. Shah P.C. Kehas D.J. Kenneally M.K. Dombkowski D.M. Ha T.U. Preffer F.I. Donahoe P.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3488-3499PubMed Google Scholar). Because cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) play a key role in modulation of growth (19Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 20Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar), we first examined MIS-mediated CDKI regulation during growth inhibition. CDKIs are a family of molecules that inhibit the kinase activity of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes, whose targets such as the retinoblastoma family gene products, Rb, p107, and p130 modulate cell cycle progression (20Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar, 21Okuda T. Hirai H. Valentine V.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kidd V.J. Lahti J.M. Sherr C.J. Downing J.R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). There are two classes of CDKIs based on their specificity toward CDKs. The CIP family, which includes p21, p27, and p57, has a broader specificity toward CDKs than do members of the INK4 family, which includes p15, p16, p18, and p19 and specifically inhibits the kinase activity of CDK 4 and CDK 6 (20Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). The p16 locus 9p21 is mutated or silenced in a variety of human cancers and cell lines, and it encodes for two unrelated polypeptides p16 and p14ARF (23Kamb A. Gruis N.A. Weaver-Feldhaus J. Liu Q.

Although several reports describe aberrant regulation of p16 expression in human cancers and cell lines, very few growth inhibitory molecules induce p16 expression during growth inhibition (25Pedram A. Razandi M. Hu R.M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13966-13972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p16, in addition to interrupting cell cycle progression, also regulates apoptotic cell death (26Schreiber M. Muller W.J. Singh G. Graham F.L.

Although the effects of p16 on the cell cycle are mediated predominantly through inhibition of Rb, it is also known to influence apoptosis and senescence through pathways that are independent of Rb (26Schreiber M. Muller W.J. Singh G. Graham F.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1663-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 31DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that MIS-mediated inhibition of ovarian cancer cell growth is manifested by a block in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The growth inhibitory effects of MIS are mediated through specific induction of p16 protein expression and via regulation of p130 and E2F1 in the absence of detectable levels of Rb. OVCAR 8 and COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal female bovine serum. Human ovarian surface epithelial cells HOSE 6-3 (a gift from Dr. Samuel Mok, Brigham and Women's Hospital) were grown in a 1:1 mixture of M199 (Sigma) and MDCB 105 (Sigma) media supplemented with 10% fetal female bovine serum. Dominant negative MIS type II receptor (DN-MIS type IIR) expressing OVCAR 8 clones were generated by cotransfecting 0.5 μg of hygromycin resistance plasmid and 10 μg of CMV-FLAG-tagged rat dominant negative MIS type II receptor by calcium phosphate DNA precipitation technique. Clones were maintained in medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Binding studies with biotinylated MIS were done as described previously (18Masiakos P.T. MacLaughlin D.T. Maheswaran S. Teixeira J. Fuller Jr., A.F. Shah P.C. Kehas D.J. Kenneally M.K. Dombkowski D.M. Ha T.U. Preffer F.I. Donahoe P.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3488-3499PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit MIS type II receptor antibody was generated by injecting animals with the peptide CGTDFCNANYSHLPPSG, which corresponds to amino acids 111–127 of the receptor. The antibody was purified over a Protein A-Sepharose column before use. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against p16 (JC6), p57 (KP10), p21 (CP36), and E2F1 (KH95) were a kind gift from Dr. Ed Harlow. The rabbit anti-p27 (C-19), mouse anti-FLAG, and anti-RB (14001A) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Sigma, and PharMingen, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Bio-Rad, respectively. Proteins were harvested in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaC1, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane, and blocked in TBST (Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20; 25 mmTris, pH 7.4, 136 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween) containing 30% milk (for rabbit anti-MIS type II receptor antibody) or 5% milk (for all other antibodies). The type II receptor antibody was used at a dilution of 1:3000 in 10% milk/TBST solution, all mouse monoclonal culture supernatants (p16, p21, p57, and KH95) were used at a dilution of 1:10 in 1% milk/TBST, and anti-FLAG antibody and p27 antibodies were diluted to 1:3000 before use. Blots were incubated with the primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were washed (three times) with 10% milk/TBST (for rabbit MIS type II receptor antibody) or 1% milk/TBST (for all other antibodies) and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS cells were transfected with 3 μg of FLAG-tagged rat MIS type II receptor construct using 9 μl of FUGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and expression was detected by Western blot using antibodies to the type II receptor or FLAG. RNA was isolated from cells using an RNA STAT-60 total mRNA isolation kit (Tel-Test, Inc). 10 μg of total RNA was separated on a formaldehyde gel, transferred to HyBond membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and probed with full-length human p16 cDNA. To determine the half-life of p16 protein, cultures were treated with MIS for 24 h and cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Protein lysates were made from an equal number of cells and analyzed by Western blot using the p16 antibody. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized for 10 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked in buffer containing 5% goat serum, 5% horse serum, 2% fish skin gelatin, and 0.2% Tween in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation with mouse monoclonal anti-RB antibody (14001A) at a dilution of 1:2000 for 1 h at 37 °C, coverslips were washed in PBST (PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20) three times, 5 min each at room temperature, and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at a dilution of 1:100 in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed once in PBST and once in PBST containing DAPI and mounted on glass slides using VectaShield mounting medium (Vector). The cell cycle distribution of untreated and MIS-treated cells was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cells were detached with PBS/EDTA, fixed in 95% ethanol, and treated with propidium iodide and RNase A. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a Benton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. 2 × 106 cells from untreated and MIS-treated cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS. Lysates were incubated with proteinase K (100 μg) for 1 h at 50 °C, and the enzyme was inactivated at 70 °C. Following treatment with RNase A for 1–2 h at 50 °C, DNA was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. The growth of the human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR 8, which expresses MIS type II receptor mRNA, is inhibited following the expression of bioactive MIS ligand (18Masiakos P.T. MacLaughlin D.T. Maheswaran S. Teixeira J. Fuller Jr., A.F. Shah P.C. Kehas D.J. Kenneally M.K. Dombkowski D.M. Ha T.U. Preffer F.I. Donahoe P.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3488-3499PubMed Google Scholar). Western analysis using a rabbit MIS type II receptor antiserum demonstrated the presence of the 63-kDa endogenous receptor protein in OVCAR 8 cells (Fig. lA). Preimmune rabbit serum confirmed the specificity of anti-MIS type II receptor antibody. Antibody specificity was also confirmed using COS cells transfected with a CMV-driven FLAG-tagged rat MIS type II receptor construct (32Segev D.L. Ha T.U. Tran T.T. Kenneally M. Harkin P. Jung M. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Maheswaran S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28371-28379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). OVCAR 8 cells bound biotinylated MIS specifically with a concentration required to reach half saturation of approximately 12 nm, a measure of the dissociation constant of the MIS-receptor complex (Fig.1 B). Total binding of MIS-biotin approached saturation at a concentration of 75 nm and was specifically competed with a 10-fold molar excess of unconjugated MIS. These values were comparable to theK d and saturating concentration of MIS seen in several ovarian cancer cell lines that express the MIS type II receptor (18Masiakos P.T. MacLaughlin D.T. Maheswaran S. Teixeira J. Fuller Jr., A.F. Shah P.C. Kehas D.J. Kenneally M.K. Dombkowski D.M. Ha T.U. Preffer F.I. Donahoe P.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3488-3499PubMed Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that stable expression of a CMV-driven MIS construct in OVCAR 8 resulted in 87% inhibition of drug-resistant colony growth compared with cells transfected with the vector or the leaderless inactive form of MIS (18Masiakos P.T. MacLaughlin D.T. Maheswaran S. Teixeira J. Fuller Jr., A.F. Shah P.C. Kehas D.J. Kenneally M.K. Dombkowski D.M. Ha T.U. Preffer F.I. Donahoe P.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3488-3499PubMed Google Scholar) (see below). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed to determine whether inhibition of OVCAR 8 cell growth by MIS correlated with perturbation in the cell cycle. A 14–18% increase in the G1 phase was observed after 48 h of treatment with MIS (Fig.2 A). A difference in cell number became evident after 4–7 days of MIS treatment with increasing numbers of dying, poorly adherent cell bodies. Annexin V-FITC staining was used to detect early stage apoptosis in cells treated with MIS. Annexin V binds to phosphatidyl serine with high affinity and is translocated from the inner surface of the plasma membrane to the outside after initiation of apoptosis in most cell types. A progressive increase in annexin V staining with prolonged exposure of OVCAR 8 cells to MIS was observed; a 2-fold increase in annexin V-positive cells seen after 2 days of MIS treatment increased to 3–4 and 4- to 6-fold after 4 and 7 days, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, electrophoretic analysis of DNA from dying cells revealed fragmentation of chromatin into a nucleosomal ladder characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 2 C). This suggested that MIS-mediated growth inhibition of OVCAR 8 cells resulted from a block in cell cycle progression and ensuing cell death. Regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI), a family of molecules that inhibits the kinase activity of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes, plays a key role in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (20Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested whether MIS affects the expression of CDKIs. Western blot analysis was performed using protein lysates obtained from OVCAR 8 cells treated with MIS for various periods of time. Fig. 3 A shows that treatment with 35 nm MIS up-regulates the expression of p16 protein as early as 30 min, which persists for up to 24 h. Interestingly, the p16 protein in MIS-treated cells also appeared to have a slightly reduced mobility compared with that in untreated cells. A similar experiment performed to determine the lowest dose of MIS required to up-regulate p16 showed that a concentration as low as 7 nm (1 μg/ml) was sufficient (Fig. 3 A,lower panel). No change in levels of p27 or p57 was detected. A 2-fold induction of p21 protein and mRNA was observed in several experiments (Fig. 3 B). Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from cells treated with MIS for increasing periods of time indicated that the increase in p16 protein was not due to elevated p16 mRNA levels (Fig. 3 C, upper panel). p16 turnover calculated from cycloheximide-Western blot analysis demonstrated the half-life of p16 protein to be ∼10 h. Treatment with MIS slightly prolonged the half-life of p16 to >10 h (Fig. 3 C, lower panel). However, this increase in stability of p16 protein does not fully account for the increase in p16 protein, which is observed within 30 min of MIS treatment. It is thus likely that MIS increases the translation of p16 mRNA. This is consistent with an increase in p16 protein during squamous differentiation through mechanisms such as protein stability and increased translational activity (33Harvat B.L. Wang A. Seth P. Jetten A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111(Pt 9): 1185-1196PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β, which induces p15, p21, and p27 to inhibit the growth of different cell types (34Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar, 35Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J.

A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), failed to elevate p16 expression in OVCAR 8 cells but up-regulated the level of p21 protein (Fig. 3 D, upper and lower panels). This suggests that the signaling pathway utilized by MIS is distinct from that of TGF-β. A kinase-defective, dominant negative rat MIS type II receptor was stably transfected into OVCAR 8 cells to determine whether the increase in p16 protein is in fact mediated through the endogenous MIS type II receptor. Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated the expression of the kinase-defective receptor transgene in two OVCAR 8 cell clones (Fig. 3 E, upper panel). Failure of MIS to increase p16 in these cells indicated that this effect is mediated by the endogenous MIS type II receptor (Fig. 3 E, lower panel). Both clones demonstrated increased binding of biotinylated MIS compared with vector-transfected cells (data not shown). To determine whether up-regulation of p16 is responsible for MIS-induced inhibition of OVCAR 8 cell growth, colony inhibition assays were performed. As shown previously, stable expression of MIS in OVCAR 8 cells inhibited the growth of drug-resistant colonies by 75% compared with cells transfected with vector construct. The importance of p16 up-regulation in MIS-mediated growth inhibition is demonstrated by the ability of antisense p16 to rescue cells from MIS-mediated growth inhibition. Expression of antisense p16 alone did not increase colony numbers, suggesting that abrogation of MIS-mediated growth inhibition was not due to the enhanced proliferative potential of cells expressing it (Fig. 4 A). The ability of antisense p16 to block the translation of p16 protein was demonstrated by transient transfection of sense and antisense p16 constructs into COS cells. The presence of the antisense p16 construct inhibited the translation of p16 protein derived from a p16 expression construct (Fig. 4 B). The ability of p16 to inhibit the growth of OVCAR 8 cells was further demonstrated by expressing a CMV-driven p16 construct in OVCAR 8 cells. As seen in Fig. 4 C, expression of p16 inhibited drug-resistant colony growth by 80% compared with cells transfected with the vector. Approximately 80–90% of ovarian cancers originate from the surface epithelium of the ovary and malignant ovarian epithelial tumors have the potential to differentiate into epithelium similar to that of the Müllerian duct (14Scully R.E. Hum. Pathol. 1970; 1: 73-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 15Scully R.E. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1995; 23: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus we tested the effects of MIS on HOSE 6-3, a cell line derived from normal human ovarian surface epithelium. These laser-dissected cells were immortalized with the human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncoproteins for maintenance in vitro (37Tsao S.W. Mok S.C. Fey E.G. Fletcher J.A. Wan T.S. Chew E.C. Muto M.G. Knapp R.C. Berkowitz R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of proteins derived from HOSE 6-3 cells demonstrated the expression of MIS type II receptor (Fig.5 A). A 2- to 4-fold increase in annexin V-positive cells was seen in HOSE 6-3 cells treated with MIS for 4 days, indicating that MIS induces programmed cell death in these cells (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, MIS treatment of HOSE 6-3 cells for 24 h induced p16 protein expression (Fig.5 C). These observations suggested that MIS-mediated induction of p16 and growth regulation is also operational in the surface epithelial cells of normal ovary from which ovarian cancers derive. p16 has also been shown to modulate downstream pathways, which involve Rb, p107, p130, and members of the E2F family of transcription factors (20Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar, 38Dirks P.B. Patel K. Hubbard S.L. Ackerley C. Hamel P.A. Rutka J.T.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). OVCAR 8 cells did not express Rb protein when tested by either immunofluorescence (Fig. 6 A,upper panel) or Western blot (Fig. 6 A,lower panel) suggesting that the inhibitory effect of p16 on OVCAR 8 cell growth is mediated via an Rb-independent mechanism. Furthermore, MIS-mediated growth inhibition of HOSE 6-3 cells, immortalized with E7 and E6 oncoproteins (37Tsao S.W. Mok S.C. Fey E.G. Fletcher J.A. Wan T.S. Chew E.C. Muto M.G. Knapp R.C. Berkowitz R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), which inactivate Rb and p53, respectively, also indicates that MIS functions through a Rb, p53-independent pathway. Western blot analysis was performed to determine whether MIS regulates the expression of other members of the pocket protein family. Exposure of OVCAR 8 cells to MIS for 4 days down-regulated p130 protein levels by an estimated 5-fold with no detectable change in p107 protein (Fig. 6 B, upper panel). Difference in p130 expression could not be detected before 3 days of treatment in repeated experiments (data not shown). This suggests that the effect of MIS on p130 expression is indirect. TGF-β treatment of OVCAR 8 cells, however, had no effect on either p107 or p130 protein expression (Fig. 6 B, lower panel). Although TGF-β induced p21 expression, TGF-β treatment of OVCAR cells did not result in either an increase in the G1 phase of the cell cycle or apoptosis (data not shown). This corroborates reports that demonstrate that effects of TGF-β on growth are mediated predominantly through Rb. The ability of pRB, p107, and p130 to regulate the cell cycle depends"

This finding can be attributed to an artificial inflation of coauthors, to the exclusion of coinventors, or--more probably--to a mix of both causes. This article argues that the discrepancy between the numbers of coauthors and inventors can have significant legal consequences, as the exclusion of an inventor can render a U.S. patent invalid or seriously harm its value.

These functions are exemplified by the defining family of PDZ domain proteins (PSD-95,Dlg, and ZO-1), known as membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs).1MAGUK proteins include PSD-95/SAP-90 and the closely related PSD-93/chapsyn-110, SAP-97/hdlg, and SAP-102, all of which are found at synapses in brain; the Drosophila PSD-95/SAP-90 homolog, DLG A, which localizes to septate junctions and larval neuromuscular junctions; and ZO-1 and ZO-2, both of which associate with tight junctions between epithelial cells. MAGUKs share a common domain organization, with one or three N-terminal PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a C-terminal region homologous to guanylate kinases. PDZ domains mediate protein-protein interactions and typically bind to short amino acid motifs at the C termini of interacting proteins that include certain ion channels, adhesion molecules, and receptors.

Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while the C-terminal binding partner of CL1 is yet unknown. CL1 belongs to the large family of G protein-coupled receptors with seven-transmembrane regions (8Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It is one of the major receptors mediating the release of neurotransmitter from nerve terminals by α-latrotoxin action (10Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Kiyatkin N. Simpson L. Sugita S. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, a presynaptic localization of CL1 is very likely. Since CL1 antibodies did not function in immunocytochemical studies, the subcellular localization of CL1 remained unclear. However, latrotoxin binding studies in primary cultures of cerebellar neurons revealed that α-latrotoxin receptors are localized at pre- and postsynaptic sites (11Grasso A. Mercanti-Ciotti M.T. Neuroscience. 1993; 54: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Interestingly, homologs of CL1, termed CL2 and CL3, were identified (12Sugita S. Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32715-32724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The C-terminal ends of all CL isoforms contain the same PDZ domain recognition sequence (TSL). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that these receptors interact in vivo with a PDZ domain protein. Therefore we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the last 49 amino acids of CL1 as bait and a rat brain library as source of preys. A detailed analysis of the preys revealed that the yeast two-hybrid method is ideal to identify PDZ domain proteins. 86% of these clones encoded PDZ domain proteins, and 43% of the PDZ clones represented proteins of the Shank family (13Naisbitt S.

Shank proteins define a novel family of scaffold proteins recently identified through their interaction with a variety of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, such as GKAP or SAPAP (13Naisbitt S.

The Shank genes were independently cloned by several investigators and are hence known under different names, such as Shank (13Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J.

Here, we use the name Shank to refer to the family as a whole. This family shares a common domain organization, with ankyrin repeats near the N terminus, an SH3 (Src homology region 3) domain, a PDZ domain, proline-rich regions in the interior, and an SAM (sterile-α module) domain at the C terminus. The PDZ domain is highly conserved among the Shank family members, and significantly different from other known PDZ domains. In contrast to the MAGUKs, the PDZ domain of Shank is C-terminal of the SH3 domain,i.e. both domains have switched their relative positions. In the present study, we demonstrate that the C terminus of CL1 binds specifically to the Shank PDZ domain. We confirm this interaction using three independent methods: first, a genetic approach based on the yeast two-hybrid method; second, a co-sedimentation of Shank1 and GST-CL1 fusion protein; and third, a co-localization of CL1 and Shank1 in double-transfected HEK293 cells. Both proteins are primarily expressed in brain where they co-enrich in the postsynaptic density. Furthermore, in transfected HEK293 cells CL1 is clustered in the presence of full-length Shank1, strongly supporting an interaction of both proteinsin vivo. Yeast strain L40 (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) was sequentially transfected with the bait vector pLexN-CL1 encoding the C terminus of CL1 (amino acids 1423–1471) and a rat brain cDNA library (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) using lithium acetate (21Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on plates lacking histidine, uracil, tryptophan, lysine, and leucine. Positive clones were picked after 3 days at 30 °C, and the β-galactosidase activity of the clones was assayed by the filter method. Extrachromosomal DNA was isolated from clones that grew in the absence of histidine and were β-galactosidase positive using the glass bead method (22Ward A.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Prey plasmids were rescued in Escherichia coli HB101 cells by electroporation and selection on M9 plates containing 50 mg/liter proline and 0.1 g/liter ampicillin. For quantitation of β-galactosidase activity, yeast strains transfected with bait and prey vectors were grown in supplemented minimal medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, and leucine in a shaking incubator at 30 °C for 48 h. β-Galactosidase assays were performed on yeast extracts with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml per assay as described previously (23Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. A rat brain library in λ ZAP II was screened at high stringency (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with a 0.5-kilobase probe derived from the yeast two-hybrid screen (see above). In vivo excision of the inserts (26Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) and sequencing in pBluescript revealed that 4 clones overlapped with the clone used as probe. Overlapping clones containing the full-length coding region of Shank1 were isolated by rescreening λ phage libraries multiple times. Clones were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using fluorescently labeled primers and an ABI 370A DNA sequencer. An open reading frame of 6501 nucleotides was found for Shank1. Its start codon is in full agreement with Kozak's rules (CCACGATG (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar)). In addition, a stop codon located 36 nucleotides upstream from the start codon was identified. For Shank2 and -3 only partial clones were obtained. Sequences of Shank1, Shank2, and Shank3 have been submitted to GenBank under the names of Spank1, Spank3, and Spank2 (accession numbersAF159046, AF159048, and AF159047, respectively). Vectors for the bacterial expression of glutathioneS-transferase-Shank fusion proteins were constructed in pGEX-KG (28Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The following pGEX-Shank constructs were engineered: pGEX-Shank1 encoding residues 471–717 (referring to number AF159046); pGEX-Shank2 encoding residues 241–443 (referring to number AF159048); and pGEX-Shank3 encoding residues 1–469 (referring to numberAF159047). For CL1 expression the following pGEX constructs were generated: GST-CL1a encoding amino acids 1422–1471 of rat CL1 and its truncated version GST-CL1b encoding amino acids 1422–1468 (minus TSL construct). Constructs for expression of His6 fusion proteins were made as follows: His6 Shank1 (full-length), His6Shank1 encoding residues 480–662 (PDZ domain), and His6CASK. In detail, His6 Shank1 (full-length) was obtained by the following procedure: first, an EcoRI/BamHI fragment of Shank1 (nucleotides 1092–2065; see cloning of full-length Shank1) was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) predigested withEcoRI and BamHI. This pcDNA3 vector contains an insert encoding an N-terminal His6 tag. Second, aBamHI fragment of ShankI (nucleotides 10–1091) was generated by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI site of the construct described in step 1. Third, a Shank1 fragment containing nucleotides 4285–6504 was obtained by PCR using primers withKpnI and XbaI sites. Fourth, anEcoRI/KpnI fragment (nucleotides 2066–4284) and a KpnI/XbaI fragment (nucleotides 4285–6504) described in step 3 were subcloned into the pBluescript SKII vector (EcoRI/XbaI). Fifth, anEcoRI/XbaI fragment containing nucleotides 2066–6504 (see step 4) was cloned into the construct described in step 2. Constructs of His6 Shank1 encoding residues 480–662 (PDZ domain) and His6 CASK (full-length) were obtained by subcloning of the corresponding PCR products into pET-28a (Novagen). Full-length cDNAs of rat CASK and Shank1 (see above) were used as templates for amplification by PCR. Rat CASK cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. T. C. Südhof (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). A mammalian expression vector encoding full-length CL1 with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence inserted into its cytoplasmic tail was constructed in pCMV5 using an engineered PCR fragment of GFP that ensured reading frame conservation. For this purpose, a KpnI fragment of GFP was subcloned into the KpnI site of full-length CL1. This cloning strategy ensured that the N-terminal signal peptide essential for CL1 targeting and the C terminus essential for interaction with PDZ domain proteins remained unchanged. Full-length CL1 in pCMV5 was obtained from Dr. T. C. Südhof. All PCR-based constructs were verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing with dye terminators on an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). HEK293 and COS cells were transfected with mammalian expression vectors using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (29Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Proteins encoded by pGEX- and pET-vector constructs were expressed in E. coli and purified as described (28Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar, 30Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). For in vitro binding experiments, immobilized GST-CL1 fusion proteins were mixed with cell extracts from E. coli or HEK293 cells prior to being transformed or transfected with cDNA encoding His6Shank1. The cell extracts were obtained by solubilization with a Triton X-100 containing buffer (1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and subsequent centrifugation for 15 min at 100,000 ×g. Cell extracts with a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml were incubated with immobilized GST fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. After being washed three times with solubilization buffer, proteins bound to glutathione beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose. These proteins were analyzed with a monoclonal antibody specific for the His6 epitope (Qiagen). Subcellular fractionation was performed with minor modifications as described (31Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Brains of 2-month-old rats were homogenized in homogenization buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 320 mm sucrose) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell debris and nuclei were removed by 1000 × g centrifugation. The supernatant was spun for 20 min at 13,000 × g, resulting in supernatant S2 and pellet P2 (crude membrane fraction). S2 was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting supernatant was taken as cytoplasmic fraction. The P2 pellet was further fractionated by centrifugation in a sucrose step gradient as described (31Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). For isolation of PSD proteins, the synaptosomal fraction of the first gradient was diluted with 320 mmsucrose (60 ml/10 g wet tissue) and an equal volume of 1% Triton X-100, 320 mm sucrose, and 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. The suspension was kept on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged for 30 min at 32,800 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 320 mm sucrose, 1 mm NaHCO3 (6 ml/10 g wet tissue), and loaded onto a second sucrose gradient. The gradients were spun for 2 h at 201,800 × g. The PSD proteins banded between 1.5 and 2.0 m sucrose. The PSD proteins were further extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100, 75 mm KCl and spun for 20 min at 201,800 × g. The resulting pellet was taken as purified PSD fraction. All steps were performed at 4 °C. HEK293 cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with 0.5% gelatin (32Schnittler H.J. Franke R.P. Akbay U. Mrowietz C. Drenckhahn D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: 289-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected with a GFP expression vector encoding full-length CL1, a His6expression vector encoding full-length Shank1, or a combination of both vectors. A His6 CASK expression vector was used as a control. Coverslips were mounted onto slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) and observed with a MRC 1024 confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies to Shank1, Shank2, and Shank3 were raised against glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing residues 471–717 (Spank1, GenBank accession number AF159046), 241–443 (Spank3, GenBank accession number AF159048), and 1–469 (Spank2, GenBank accession number AF159047). A polyclonal antibody to CL1 was a gift from Dr. T. C. Südhof. Monoclonal antibodies to synaptophysin (cl. 7.2) and the NR1 subunit of theN-methyl-d-asparatate receptor (cl. 54.1) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Jahn (Max Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gšttingen, Germany). A monoclonal antibody specific for the His6 epitope was purchased from Qiagen. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed with minor modifications as described (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA blots were purchased from CLONTECH. The following probes were used: for Shank1, nucleotides 1337–1752 (referring to GenBank entry AF159046); for Shank2, nucleotides 529–933 (AF159048); and for Shank3, nucleotides 1406–2039 (AF159047). CL1 is a major α-latrotoxin receptor predominantly expressed in brain (8Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Interestingly, its C terminus contains a typical recognition sequence for PDZ domains (TSL). To identify PDZ domain proteins interacting with CL1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using its last 49 C-terminal residues as bait and a prey rat brain library of 85 million yeast clones. 110 were found to be positive in a β-galactosidase assay. 45 clones were characterized by sequencing and data base searches. Almost 90% of the sequenced clones encoded proteins with PDZ domains (Table I),e.g. PSD-95/SAP-90, SAP-102, Magi-1, S-SCAM, and ros1. Combinations of these preys with a bait devoid of the last three amino acids of CL1 did not show any positive β-galactosidase activity in a retransformation assay (Table I, column 5, values in brackets). Thus, we conclude that the measured β-galactosidase activities depend almost entirely on the existence of the last three amino acids of CL1, implying that PDZ domains mediate the interactions. Only one exception was found. The interaction with KIAA0229 protein was independent of the last three amino acids of CL1, suggesting that PDZ domains are not involved in mediating this interaction. Indeed, a detailed sequence analysis of KIAA0229 did not detect a PDZ domain.Table IAnalysis of a yeast two-hybrid screen performed with the C terminus of CL1 as baitName of cloneTotal number of clonesNumber of independent clonesAccession no.Specific activityShank1102AF159046950 (17)KIAA022963D869821420 (1355)PSD-95/SAP-9062M9685380 (12)Shank353AF1590471230 (25)KIAA014752D634811820 (35)ros141X51619345 (67)SAP-10232RNU5014785 (12)Shank221AF1590481034 (28)Magi-122AF027503ND 1-aND, not determined.S-SCAM11AF034863NDMAST205Σ4511MMU2313NDTo identify proteins interacting with CL1, we used its last 49 C-terminal residues as bait. 85 million yeast clones were co-transfected with the CL1 bait plasmid and plasmids from a rat brain library.

In this screen, almost 40% of all positive clones encoded proteins of the Shank family (13Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M.

Since the yeast two-hybrid clones contained only partial coding sequences, we used one of these as probe to screen a rat brain cDNA library. Multiple screens were necessary to obtain the entire reading frame. The full-length clone that we obtained by ligation of four overlapping subclones encoded a protein with 2167 residues. This protein was almost identical with Shank1. Minor differences to the Shank1 sequence (accession number AF131951) were obvious. Shank1 in comparison with our sequence was lacking 72 residues at the N terminus and an internal sequence of 8 residues (residues 797 to 804). Since Shank1 was unknown at that time, we submitted our sequence to GenBank under the name Spank1 (GenBank accession numberAF159046). The full-length clone of Shank1 that we constructed by ligation of four overlapping clones is composed of six ankyrin repeats near the N terminus, anSH3 domain, a PDZ domain, proline-rich regions in the interior and an SAM domain at the C terminus (Fig.1 A). Both clones,i.e. Shank2 and -3, show an identical domain composition in the regions available for sequence analysis (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, a sequence alignment showed unambiguously that they belong to a protein family. Since Shank2 and -3 represent only partial clones, some domains are missing (submitted to GenBank under the names of Spank3 and -2, respectively, GenBank accession numbers AF159048 andAF159047, respectively). Shank proteins contain one PDZ domain that is highly conserved within the family (Fig. 1 B). Compared with other PDZ domains,e.g. these of PSD-95/SAP-90, SAP-102, and Magi-1, striking differences were observed. In contrast to the MAGUKs, the PDZ domain of Shank is C-terminal of the SH3 domain, i.e. the positions of these domains are switched. The existence of a histidine residue located 23 residues upsteam from the PDZ domain end identifies the PDZ domain of Shank as a member of the PSD-95 group (group 1A according to (35Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar)). RNA blots loaded with poly(A)-enriched RNA from different rat tissues were hybridized at high stringency with probes specific for the Shank isoforms. mRNAs for all three Shanks were only detected in brain (Fig.2). The sizes of the mRNAs for the different isoforms vary from 9.0 (Shank1) to 7.5 (Shank3) and 8.5 kilobases (Shank2). Two other bands detected by cross-hybridization in kidney and lung are different in size compared with the respective Shank mRNAs in brain. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that these bands are due to additional Shank isoforms. Surprisingly, the distribution of Shank3 is different to its reported distribution (36Lim S.

In our hands, Shank3 mRNA is almost exclusively expressed in brain. At present, the reason for this discrepancy is unknown. It is possible that alternative splice variants of Shank3 are differentially expressed in various tissues. Indeed, such a mechanism is reported for Shank1 and -2 but not for Shank3 (36Lim S.

https://openalex.org/W2012236903,"Heparin is an intracellular product of vertebrate mast cell currently used as exogenous anticoagulant. Despite of the potent biological activities of exogenous heparin, its physiological function has not been clearly established yet. Here, a heparin with similar structure and anticoagulant properties to the mammalian counterpart was shown to occur as the intracellular product of test cells, a cell monolayer that surrounds egg of the invertebrateStyela plicata (Chordata-Tunicata). As in the case of mammalian mast cells, heparin from the ascidian test cells is removed from the intracellular granules after incubation with compound 48/80. Following fertilization, the test cells surrounding the developing larva still retain heparin as metachromatic granulation. In the adult invertebrate, heparin occurs as intracellular granules at the apical tip of epithelial cells surrounding the lumen of both intestine and pharynx, in close contact with the external environment. This is the first description of the presence of heparin in cytoplasmic granules of epithelial-like cells around the lumen of sites exposed to external agents. This arrangement may reflect the participation of heparin in defense mechanisms in this invertebrate. Heparin is an intracellular product of vertebrate mast cell currently used as exogenous anticoagulant. Despite of the potent biological activities of exogenous heparin, its physiological function has not been clearly established yet. Here, a heparin with similar structure and anticoagulant properties to the mammalian counterpart was shown to occur as the intracellular product of test cells, a cell monolayer that surrounds egg of the invertebrateStyela plicata (Chordata-Tunicata). As in the case of mammalian mast cells, heparin from the ascidian test cells is removed from the intracellular granules after incubation with compound 48/80. Following fertilization, the test cells surrounding the developing larva still retain heparin as metachromatic granulation. In the adult invertebrate, heparin occurs as intracellular granules at the apical tip of epithelial cells surrounding the lumen of both intestine and pharynx, in close contact with the external environment. This is the first description of the presence of heparin in cytoplasmic granules of epithelial-like cells around the lumen of sites exposed to external agents.

The heparin molecules are made up of a heterogeneous mixture of polymers with a similar backbone, which results from variations of sulfation on the d-glucosamine (N-acetylated, N-sulfated, O-sulfated at C6 and/or C3) and on the uronic acid residue (O-sulfated at C2) (1Lane D.A. Lindhal U. Heparin: Chemical and Biological Properties, Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989Google Scholar). So far, heparin has been found exclusively as an intracellular product in the secretory granules of mast cells, and is released only when mast cells degranulate in response to extracellular signals (2Straus A.H. Nader H.B. Dietrich C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 717: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 3Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 4Conrad H.E. Heparin Binding Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). Because of its unique binding to antithrombin, involving a specific pentasaccharide sequence containing a 3-O-sulfated glucosamine, heparin is endowed of a potent anticoagulant activity (1Lane D.A. Lindhal U. Heparin: Chemical and Biological Properties, Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989Google Scholar,5Lindhal U. Lindholt K. Spillman D. Kjellén L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, apparently, its physiological function is not to regulate blood coagulation. This function is mostly achieved by endothelial cell-derived heparan sulfate proteoglycan of the syndecan family (6Kojima T Leone C.W. Marchildon G.A. Marcum J.A. Rosemberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4859-4869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent publications suggest that the physiological roles of heparin are more likely related to the regulation of the activity and release of mast cell proteases (7Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S.

In some species of invertebrates, coagulation of blood fluid has some analogy to blood clotting in vertebrates, but involving totally different proteins (9Young N.S. Levin J. Prendergast R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 1790-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Barwig B. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1985; 155: 135-143Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Coagulation prevents the loss of hemolymph from a wound and also immobilizes microorganisms that invade the body. In tunicates, however, hemolymph coagulation does not occur, and the prevention of body fluid loss and the defense against microorganism invasion involves aggregation of hemocytes (12Ratclife N.A. Rowley A.F. Fitzgerald S.W. Rhodes C.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1985; 97: 183-350Crossref Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 13Wright R.K. Ratcliffe N.A. Rowley A.F. Invertebrate Blood Cells. Academic Press, London1981: 565-626Google Scholar). The hemagglutinating activity of hemocytes is inhibited by heparin and is mediated by hemagglutinin, a 160-kDa membrane glycoprotein that binds heparin and various bacteria (14Takahashi H. Azumi K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 233: 778-783Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, no physiological role has been reported for heparin in invertebrates, besides the report of the occurrence of a heparin-like glycosaminoglycan (denoted as mactin) in some species of mollusk (15Dietrich C.P. Paiva J.F. Morais C.T. Takahashi H.K. Porcionato M.A. Nader H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 843: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A possible clue concerning the physiological roles of heparin has come from an apparently unrelated project. In the course of our extensive studies about sulfated polysaccharides from different species of ascidians (16Pavão M.S.G. Albano R.M. Lawson A.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27848-27857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we found that one of the species possesses high amounts of heparin. In contrast to the mammalian and mollusk counterparts, heparin occurs in the ascidan as the intracellular product of cell monolayer that surrounds egg and the lumen of both intestine and pharynx of the invertebrate Styela plicata(Chordata-Tunicata). This arrangement of heparin-rich cells may reflect the participation of heparin in defense mechanisms in this invertebrate. Adult specimens of S. plicata were collected at Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Animals were maintained in an aerated aquarium at 20 °C until use. The gonads of several ascidians were carefully separated from other tissues, under magnifying lenses, and the eggs isolated by filtrating the gonads several times through a 0.5-mm-diameter net in sea water (pH 6.0). The eggs collected in the filtrate, free of contaminating tissues, were washed with 500 ml of filtered sea water (pH 6.0) and 500 ml of sulfate-free artificial sea water (pH 8.0). These procedures are important to remove contaminating tissues rich in sulfated polysaccharides, which may be present in preparations from ascidian eggs. For histochemical preparations, the eggs were fixed in 5% formaldehyde in sea water for 2 h at room temperature. After fixation, the eggs were washed with water, dehydrated in graded ethanol, cleared in xylol and embedded in Para-plast (melting point, 55.6 °C). Approximately 7-μm sections from the egg were cut longitudinally on a Spencer Microtone. Sections were stained with 0.05 m1,9-dimethyl-methylene blue in 0.1 m HCl, containing 0.04 mm glycine and 0.04 m NaCl. For immunofluorescence analysis, ascidian eggs or tissues were embedded in OCT (Miles Inc.) and cut into 8-μm sections. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),1 the sections were incubated with phosphate buffer/artificial sea water solution, mixed with 0.1% skim milk, 150 mm NH4Cl, and 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) for 30 min, washed in 15 mmNH4Cl and 0.1% skim milk in phosphate buffer/artificial sea water. This incubation avoided nonspecific binding of antibody. The sections were then submitted to the following treatments: (a) primary anti-heparin monoclonal antibody ST-1 (22Straus A.H. Travassos L.R. Takahashi H.K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) for 12 h; (b) four washes for 15 s each in PBS; (c) secondary anti-mouse Ig antibody conjugated to biotin, diluted 1:100 times in 5% goat serum + bovine serum albumin for 1.5 h; (d) four washes for 15 s each in PBS; (e) fluorescein isothiocyanate/streptavidin, diluted 1:50 times in Tris/HCl, containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h; (f) four washes for 15 s each in PBS. The sections were then mounted in N-propyl gallate and examined under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Axioplan). The ascidian eggs were immersed in acetone and kept for 24 h at 4 °C. The dried eggs (1 g) were suspended in 20 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), containing 100 mg of papain, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm cysteine and incubated at 60 °C during 24 h. The incubation mixture were then centrifuged (2000 × g for 10 min at room temperature) and another 100 mg of papain in 20 ml of the same buffer, containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm cysteine was added to the precipitate and incubated for another 24 h. The clear supernatant from the two extractions were combined and the polysaccharides precipitated with two volumes of 95% ethanol and maintained at 4 °C for 24 h. The precipitates formed were collected by centrifugation (2000 × g for 10 min at room temperature), freeze dried and dissolved in 2 ml of distilled water (“pool 1”). The preponderant sulfated polysaccharides obtained after these procedures have a non-glycosaminoglycans structure (23Cavalcante M.C.M. Mourão P.A.S. Pavão M.S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In order to solubilize heparin, it is necessary to repeat the extraction procedure with papain two more times (“pool 2”). The glycosaminoglycans (∼20 mg) obtained from the third and fourth extractions with papain (pool 2, see above) were applied to a Mono Q-FPLC column, equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The glycosaminoglycans were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–2.0m NaCl (10 ml) at a flow rate of 0.45 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and checked by metachromatic assay using 1,9-dimethyl methylene blue (24Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Banet A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2865) Google Scholar). The fractions containing heparin were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. Ascidian heparin and standard mammalian heparin (50 μg as dry weight of each) were incubated with 0.005 unit of either heparan sulfate-lyase or heparin-lyase (25Linhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.-M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) in 100 μl of 100 mmsodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0), containing 10 mm calcium acetate for 17 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, the mixtures were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (26Dietrich C.P. Dietrich S.M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) in order to determine digestion of the glycosaminoglycan with heparan sulfate- or heparin-lyase. In order to determine the disaccharide composition, the ascidian and mammalian heparins were incubated simultaneously with both heparin- and heparan sulfate-lyases, as described in the previous paragraph. Disaccharides were recovered by a Superdex peptide column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) linked to a HPLC system from Shimadzu (Tokyo, Japan). The column was eluted with distilled water:acetonitrile:trifluoroacetic acid (80:20:0.1,v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected and monitored for UV absorbance at 232 nm. Fractions corresponding to disaccharides (>90% of the degraded material) were pooled, freeze-dried, and stored at −20 °C. This disaccharide preparation and standard compounds were subjected to a SAX-HPLC analytical column (250 × 4.6 mm, Sigma-Aldrich), as follows. After equilibration in the mobile phase (distilled water adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl) at 0.5 ml/min, samples were injected and disaccharides eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1.0 m over 45 min in the same mobile phase. The eluant was collected in 0.5-ml fractions and monitored for UV absorbance at 232 nm for comparison with lyase-derived disaccharide standards. 1H and 13C spectra were recorded using a Bruker DRX 600 with a triple resonance probe. About 2 mg each of invertebrate and mammalian heparins were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 99.9% D2O (CIL). All spectra were recorded at 60 °C with HOD suppression by presaturation. COSY, TOCSY, and1H/13C heteronuclear correlation (HMQC) spectra were recorded using states-time proportion phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the indirect dimension. TOCSY spectra were run with 4,096 × 400 points with a spin-lock field of about 10 kHz and a mixing time of 80 ms. HMQC were run with 1,024 × 256 points and globally optimized alternating phase rectangular pulses for decoupling. Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra were run with a mixing time of 100 ms. All chemical shifts were relative to external trimethylsilylpropionic acid and [13C]methanol. Activated partial thromboplastin clotting time assays were carried out as following: normal human plasma (100 μl) was incubated with 10 μl of a solution of heparin (0.01–1 μg) at 37 °C for 1 min. Then 100 μl of APTT reagent (Celite -Biolab) were added and incubated at 37 °C. After 2 min of incubation, 100 μl of 0.25 m CaCl2 were added to the mixtures and the clotting time recorded in a coagulometer (Amelung KC4A). These effects were evaluated by the assay of amydolytic activity of thrombin using chromogenic substrate, as described (21Pavão M.S.G. Aiello K.R.M. Werneck C.C. da Silva L.C.F. Valente A.P. Mulloy B. Clowell N.S. Tollefsen D.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27848-27857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Incubations were preformed in disposable UV semi-microcuvettes. The final concentrations of reactants included 50 nm antithrombin or 68 nm heparin cofactor II, 15 nm thrombin, and 0–10 μg/ml heparin in 100 μl of 0.02 m Tris/HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1.0 mg/ml polyethylene glycol (pH 7.4) (TS/PEG buffer). Thrombin was added last to initiate the reaction. After a 60-s incubation at room temperature, 500 μl of 100 μm chromogenic substrate S-2238 (Chromogenix AB, Molndal, Sweden) in TS/PEG buffer was added and the absorbance at 405 nm was recorded for 100 s. The rate of change of absorbance was proportional to the thrombin activity remaining in the incubation. No inhibition occurred in control experiments in which thrombin was incubated with antithrombin or heparin cofactor II in the absence of heparin. Nor did inhibition occur when thrombin was incubated with heparin alone over the range of concentrations tested. Ascidian eggs surrounded by test cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with 0.2 mm compound 48/80 (27Chahdi A. Fraundorfer P.F. Beaven M.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 122-130PubMed Google Scholar) in filtered sea water (pH 8.0) for 15 min at 37 °C, centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min and staining with 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue for 5 min at room temperature. After degranulation, the cells were immediately examined under microscope (Olympus, BH-2). The sulfated polysaccharide (pool 2) extracted from the eggs of the ascidian S. plicata with protease digestion eluted from a Mono Q-FPLC column as a symmetric peak at 1.5m NaCl, as mammalian heparin (Fig.1 A). The invertebrate glycosaminoglycan is not degraded by heparan sulfate lyase, but completely disappears from the gel after degradation with heparin lyase (Fig. 1 B).Figure 1Purification of the ascidian heparin on a Mono Q-FPLC column (A) and analysis of its susceptibility to heparin or heparan sulfate lyase (B). A, about 20 mg of ascidian (●) or mammalian (○) heparin were applied to a Mono Q-FPLC column and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions were assayed for metachromasia and NaCl concentration. The fractions indicated by horizontal bar were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. B, purified ascidian heparin (10 μg), before (intact) and after incubation with heparan sulfate lyase or heparin lyase were applied to a 0.5% agarose gel and run for 1 h at 110 V in 1,3-diaminopropane/acetate (pH 9.0). The glycosaminoglycans in the gel were fixed with 0.1%N-acetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide solution. After 12 h, the gel was dried and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in acetic acid/ethanol/water (0.1:5:5, v/v).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the disaccharides produced by digestion with heparin lyase on a Spherisorb SAX-HPLC, reveals that the invertebrate glycosaminoglycan yields mainly the disaccharide ΔUA(2SO4)-1→4-β-d-GlcN(SO4)-6(SO4), originated from the trisulfated units (Fig.2 and TableI). The disaccharide ΔUA-1→4-d-GlcN(SO4)-6(SO4) was also detected (∼30% of the total products). This disaccharide composition is close to those reported for heparin preparation from mammalian tissues and by far more sulfated than heparan sulfate samples (4Conrad H.E. Heparin Binding Proteins.

Thus, one-dimensional1H NMR spectra show two main anomeric resonances at 5.39 and 5.19 ppm, assigned as α-d-glucosamine and α-l-iduronic acid residues, respectively (Fig.3 A). Two additional anomeric protons at 5.29 and 4.96 ppm are also present in a 1:1 ratio in the spectrum of the ascidian heparin (Fig. 3 B). These anomeric signals are easily recognized by the 1H/13C HMQC spectrum (Fig. 4).Figure 41 H/13C HMQC spectrum of the ascidian heparin. The assignment was based on TOCSY and COSY spectra except for H6, which was based on comparison with mammalian heparin.

Open table in a new tab Based on literature data, we concluded that the two extra spin systems in the ascidian heparin corresponds to a disaccharide unit in which α-d-glucosamine is linked to a non-sulfated α-l-iduronic acid unit (Tables II and III). Glucosamine residues linked to either 2-O-sulfated or non-sulfated α-l-iduronic acid units have approximately the same chemical shifts for H2, H3, H5, and H6 (see TOCSY spectrum in Fig. 5), but differ in the chemical shifts of H1 and H4. The α-l-iduronic acid residues from the two types of disaccharide units have the same chemical shifts for H4 and H5, but the H2 is 0.76 ppm downfield in the 2-O-sulfated unit, as expected. The integrals of the four anomeric resonances in the 1H spectrum of ascidian heparin (Fig. 3 B, inset) suggests a 7:3 ratio of disaccharide units containing 2-O-sulfated and non-sulfated α-l-iduronic acid residues. The anomeric resonance of non-sulfated iduronic acid unit can be seen in the 1H spectrum of mammalian heparin (Fig. 3 A), but the signal intensity is much smaller than in ascidian heparin. The corresponding glucosamine anomeric resonance appears as a shoulder in the predominant unit. The NMR spectra are in agreement with the analysis of the disaccharides produced by heparin lyase digestion, since both confirm the occurrence of ∼30% of non-sulfated α-l-iduronic acid units in the invertebrate heparin, which are undetected in the mammalian heparin standard we used. 2During the biosynthesis of mammalian heparin, the 2-O-sulfation occurs first and then the 6-O-sulfotransferase will act on IdoA(2SO4)-GlcN(SO4) residues (34Ofuso F.A. Danishefsky I. Heparin and Related Polysaccharides. New York Academy of Sciences, New York1989Google Scholar, 35Salmivirta M. Lindholt K. Lindhal U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). At the end, the major disaccharide unit of heparin is IdoA(2SO4)-GlcN(SO4)-(6SO4). However, if some regulatory mechanism led to the 6-O-sulfation to occur first, the 2-O-sulfotransferase cannot act and the end product is IdoA-GlcN(SO4)-(6SO4). During the biosynthesis of the invertebrate heparin, this later mechanism is more relevant than in mammalian tissues. The invertebrate heparin has an anticoagulant activity of 19 units/mg, as determined by the APTT assay using a parallel standard curve based on Standard Heparin (193 units/mg), 4th International Standard (Fig. 6 a). The IC50 for thrombin inhibition in the presence of antithrombin is 0.01 and 0.0005 μg/ml for the invertebrate and mammalian heparins, respectively (Fig. 6 b). When antithrombin is replaced by heparin cofactor II, both heparins have approximately the same IC50 for thrombin inhibition (Fig.6 c). These coagulation assays demonstrate that the invertebrate heparin has a lower anticoagulant activity than the mammalian standard. Lower activity may be related to the relative paucity of the high affinity pentasaccharide (28Björk I. Lindhal U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 48: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 29Lindhal U. Bäckström G. Höök M. Thunberg L. Fransson -Å L. Linker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3198-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) in the invertebrate heparin. The heparin cofactor II activity, on the other hand, does not show significant variation, as expected, since the activation of heparin cofactor II by heparin is charge-dependent and does not involve a specific structure sequence (30Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Overall, these experiments demonstrated the parallel between the anticoagulant action of heparin extracted from the ascidian eggs and standard heparin preparation from mammalian tissue. We attempted to identify the cell type in the ascidian eggs that contains heparin. InS. plicata, the oocytes are surrounded by somatic test cells that reside at the surface of zygotes during development. The function of these cells during embryogenesis is unknown (31Cloney R.A. Acta Zool. 1990; 71: 151-159Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Histochemical analysis of the ascidian eggs, using the cationic dye 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (24Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Banet A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2865) Google Scholar), revealed a strong metachromatic staining associated with intracellular granules in the test cells around the oocyte (Fig. 7 a), suggesting the occurrence of heparin. Immunofluorescence staining with anti-heparin monoclonal antibody ST-1 confirmed that antibody labeling was restricted to the test cells (Fig. 7,b–e). 3Histamine was also detected in the ascidian test cells using anti-histamine monoclonal antibody and the enzyme histamineN-methyltransferase. No specific labeling was detected in the oocyte. Following fertilization, the test cells continue to surround the developing larvae, and still retain the metachromatic granulation (data not shown). Thus, the presence of heparin in these cells is not related with the fertilization process. A rather interesting aspect of the test cells, which may reflect their function, is the fact that compound 48/80, a potent stimulator of mast cell degranulation, also promote degranulation of test cells (Fig. 8), as suggested by the loss of metachromasia of the test cells after incubation with 48/80. Preliminary experiments, in which tryptase activity was measured in the supernatants of pure preparations of test cells after degranulation with compound 48/80, indicated that degranulation is associated with protease release (data not shown). However, future experiments are required to further address this issue.Figure 8Degranulation of the test cell-heparin-containing granules with compound 48/80. The test cell-containing ascidan eggs were incubated with compound 48/80, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After incubation, the cells were stained with 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue and immediately examined under microscope.

Bars, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we investigated whether the tissues of the adult ascidian still retain heparin. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans were extracted from the adult invertebrate by protease digestion and purified by anion exchange chromatography. Again, we detected heparin eluted from Mono Q-FPLC column at 1.5m NaCl, but, in contrast to the ascidian eggs, we also detected dermatan sulfate in adult tissues. Heparin from the adult invertebrate produces the same types and proportions of disaccharides after digestion with heparin lyase (data not shown), indicating that both adult and egg heparin have the same structure. In order to investigate the localization of heparin in the adult invertebrate, we stained sections of intestine and pharynx with 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue and with anti-heparin monoclonal antibody (Fig. 9). A strong metachromatic staining is associated with cytoplasmic granules at the apical tip of epithelial cells, surrounding the lumen of both intestine (Fig. 9 a) and pharynx (Fig. 9 d), in close contact with the external environment of the animal. The metachromatic staining co-localizes with anti-heparin immune staining in both intestine (Fig. 9 b) and pharynx (Fig. 9 e). This is a similar arrangement as observed in the test cells, surrounding the oocyte (Fig. 7). The metachromatic staining of the cells resists incubation with chondroitin ABC lyase, excluding the occurrence of high amounts of dermatan and chondroitin sulfate in these cells (data not shown). This is the first report of the occurrence of heparin in cytoplasmic granules of epithelial-like cells around the lumen of sites exposed to external agents. A glycosaminoglycan similar to heparin was described previously in invertebrates (mostly in species of mollusk) and denoted as “mactin” (15Dietrich C.P. Paiva J.F. Morais C.T. Takahashi H.K. Porcionato M.A. Nader H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 843: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in this case, heparin occurs again as the intracellular product of connective tissue cell similar to mast cells, with a diffuse distribution as in vertebrates (32Oliani S.M. Freymuller E. Takahashi H.K. Straus A.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We can speculate that the arrangement of heparin-containing cells around the lumen of sites exposed to the exterior may reflect the participation of heparin in defense mechanisms in the invertebrate. In ascidians, the defense against microorganism invasion and the prevention of body fluid loss involves aggregation of hemocytes that migrate from the hemolymph. The hemagglutinating activity is inhibited by heparin and is mediated by hemagglutinin, a 160-kDa membrane glycoprotein that binds heparin and various bacteria (33Ratcliffe N.A. Rowley A.F. Invertebrate Blood Cells. Academic Press, London1981Google Scholar). Perhaps, heparin released from the epithelial cells act as a regulator of the hemagglutinating activity of hemocytes during microorganism invasion. We are grateful to Adriana A. Piquet for technical assistance, to Dr. George A. dos Reis for help in the preparation of this manuscript, and to Dr. Marco A. Martins (Fundação Fio Cruz) for help in the experiments with the enzyme histamine N-methyltransferase."

Hausmann R.E. J. Exp. Zool. 1969; 171: 15-24Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In 1961, Fawcett (2Fawcett D.W. Lenhoff H.M. Loomis W.F. The Biology of Hydra and of Some Other Coelenterates. University of Miami Press, Miami, FL1961: 65Google Scholar) first noticed the physical similarities between mesoglea and vertebrate basement membrane, the specialized sheets of ECM1 composed mainly of type IV collagen, laminin, nidogen/entactin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan that underlie or surround cells. Although the mesoglea lies between two organized epithelial cell layers and has an obvious role in physical support of the organism, this ECM is also implicated in several cellular processes. In vitro studies showed that epithelial cells (3Day R.M. Lenhoff H.M. Science. 1981; 211: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and nematocysts (4Agosti C.G. Stidwill R.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1991; 20: 215-227Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) could attach to and migrate along isolated mesoglea or substrata coated with purified ECM components such as collagen IV and laminin. Zhang and Sarras (5Zhang X. Sarras Jr., M.P. Development. 1994; 120: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that in addition to cell-cell interactions and chemotactic gradients, cell migration also depends on cell-matrix interactions. Using two modified grafting procedures, in which normal cell-matrix interactions were perturbed, they showed that interstitial cell migration is sensitive to alterations in collagen structure and that migration is inhibited by molecules that can compete with cell-fibronectin interactions. The relation of mesoglea to higher metazoan connective tissue has been speculated on for at least the past century. By the early 1950s it was recognized that mesoglea was structurally and chemically similar to vertebrate connective tissues. Since then several biochemical studies have provided evidence of collagen-like molecules in isolated hydra mesoglea (6Shostak S. Patel N.G. Burnett A.L. Dev. Biol. 1965; 12: 434-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Hausman R.E. Burnett A.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1971; 177: 435-446Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Barzansky B. Lenhoff H.M. Amer. Zool. 1974; 14: 575-581Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). More recent studies on mesoglea by Sarras et al. (9Sarras Jr., M.P. Madden E.M. Zhang X. Gunwar S. Huff J.K. Hudson B.G. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Sarras Jr., M.P. Meador D. Zhang X. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using indirect immunocytochemistry suggested the presence of molecules similar to type IV collagen, laminin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein (all characteristic of vertebrate BM) in mesoglea, as well as fibronectin, a component of interstitial ECM. In frozen sections, antibodies to ECM components appeared localized to the mesoglea layer between the epithelial bilayer. The presence of a hydra laminin in mesoglea was confirmed when cDNA clones encoding a β1 chain of laminin were isolated (11Sarras Jr., M.P. Yan L. Grens A. Zhang X. Agbas A. Huff J.K. St. John P.L. Abrahamson D.R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A fibrillar collagen has also recently been isolated from mesoglea and characterized (12Deutzmann R. Fowler S. Zhang X. Boone K. Dexter S. Boot-Handford R.P. Rachel R. Sarras Jr., M.P. Development. 2000; 127: 4669-4680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), providing further evidence that mesoglea represents a primitive ECM exhibiting composite basement membrane and interstitial matrix properties. So far six genetically different mammalian type IV α chains, α1(IV) to α6(IV), have been identified which interact to form various heterotrimeric triple-helical isoforms (13Johansson C. Butkowski R. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24533-24537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kühn K. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 439-445Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Type IV α chains have also been characterized in invertebrates includingDrosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, sea urchin, and sponge (15Blumberg B. MacKrell A. Fessler J.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 88: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The primary structure of all the α(IV) chains is similar, each chain having a short noncollagenous sequence at the N terminus, a central collagenous region consisting of Gly-X-Y repeats, and a highly conserved C-terminal noncollagenous (NC1) domain (20Leinonen A. Mariyama M. Mochizuki T. Tryggvason K. Reeders S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26172-26177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike fibrillar collagens, the long collagenous domain is interrupted at several sites by short, noncollagenous, sequences that are thought to impart flexibility on the molecule (21Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Type IV collagen molecules interact to form a complex, irregular network that provides the BM with a high level of stability. Zhang et al. (22Zhang X. Huff J.K. Hudson B.G. Sarras Jr., M.P. Diabetologia. 1990; 33: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) produced hydra cell aggregates and exposed the regenerating hydra to levels of glucose that mimic those in human diabetic patients (15 mm). Regeneration occurred as normal although within 72 h, glucose-treated reaggregating animals synthesized mesoglea twice the normal thickness, suggesting that the hydra may be a nonmammalian and temporally rapid model for the study of the much longer term glucose-induced basement membrane thickening seen in diabetic microangiopathy. In this study, using a hydra fibrillar collagen cDNA as a probe in a low stringency screen, overlapping clones were isolated that encode a complete hydra collagen IV α chain. In addition, type IV collagen protein was purified from hydra mesoglea and partially sequenced. All of the peptide sequences obtained are present within the primary sequence deduced from the cDNAs. The importance of collagen IV in hydra development is demonstrated using antisense thio-oligonucleotides, which block head regeneration. In addition, we show that the mesoglea of adult (rather than the previously demonstrated regenerating) hydra is rapidly thickened and collagen IV expression is up-regulated upon exposure to glucose. H. vulgaris were maintained at 18 °C in hydra medium (HM) as described previously by Sarraset al. (9Sarras Jr., M.P. Madden E.M. Zhang X. Gunwar S. Huff J.K. Hudson B.G. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cultures were washed regularly and fedArtemia salina (brine shrimp) three times a week. ECM-enriched segmented hydra were prepared (9Sarras Jr., M.P. Madden E.M. Zhang X. Gunwar S. Huff J.K. Hudson B.G. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and allowed to regenerate for 24 h. Poly (A+) RNA was extracted and used as template for cDNA synthesis with either oligo(dT) or random primers. The randomly primed cDNA was cloned into Stratagenes λZAPII vector (the HZAPII library), whereas the 3′-biased oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was directionally cloned into Stratagenes UniZAP vector (the HUZAP library). 3 × 105recombinant clones of the HZAPII library were screened with a32P-labeled 2.3-kb hydra fibrillar collagen probe, HC1, which encodes the 5′ half of hydra type I/II collagen (12Deutzmann R. Fowler S. Zhang X. Boone K. Dexter S. Boot-Handford R.P. Rachel R. Sarras Jr., M.P. Development. 2000; 127: 4669-4680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and washed first at low stringency (45 °C, 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) then at high stringency (65 °C, 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS). After each wash, filters were exposed to x-ray film for 16 h. Plaques that hybridized only at low stringency were chosen for secondary and tertiary screening.In vivo excised (ZAPPED) clones were cycle sequenced using an ABI PRISM XL 377 DNA sequencer in combination with a Big Dye terminator chemical kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The DNA clones were sequenced in both directions using a primer walking strategy shown in Fig. 1. Comparisons of DNA sequences were conducted using the Blastn and Blastx programs and the GenBankTM data base (NCBI, National Institutes of Health). Protein alignments were obtained using the Blastp, GCG, and MacVector 5.0 For isolation of collagen, stocks of H. vulgaris were used that had been stored at −78 °C after shock freezing at −196 °C in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10 μg/ml of the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and p-chloromercuribenzoate. For preparative extractions typically polyps from 20 plastic dishes (20 × 20 cm) grown to a density of about 6000 hydranths/tray were used. All preparations were done at 4 °C. After thawing, the hydras were washed with the same buffer as used for freezing until the supernatant was colorless. This procedure removed most of the cellular proteins. To remove cell surface proteins still bound to the mesoglea, the material was washed once more with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the same protease inhibitors as above. Subsequently, the mesoglea collagens were extracted with 10 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer containing 1m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 5 h at 4 °C. This fraction contained the majority of the type IV collagen and in addition a fibrillar collagen (12Deutzmann R. Fowler S. Zhang X. Boone K. Dexter S. Boot-Handford R.P. Rachel R. Sarras Jr., M.P. Development. 2000; 127: 4669-4680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate denatured collagen chains for sequence analysis, the EDTA extract was made 1% in mercaptoethanol and separated by reversed phase chromatography on a Vydac C-18 column (Separations Group, 250 × 2.2 mm) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using a gradient of 5–70% acetonitril in 50 min. Two major peaks at 21 and 35% of the organic modifier were obtained, the latter of which contained the type IV collagen. After lyophilization, the isolated chains were dissolved in 70% formic acid or 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate for digestion with cyanogen bromide and trypsin, respectively. The peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography and sequenced on a Procise 492A sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with on-line detection of the PTH amino acids according to the manufacturer's instructions. To isolate the type IV collagen under nondenaturing conditions, the EDTA extract, supplemented with mercaptoethanol, was centrifuged at 45000 rpm in a Beckman 50 TI rotor. The supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and separated on a HiTrap Q column (1 ml) using a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 40 min. Hydra collagen IV eluted as a broad peak in the range of 0.2–0.4m NaCl. Samples were analyzed on 4–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For electron microscopy, samples (about 50 μg/ml) were mixed with an equal volume of glycerol and, after spraying onto mica discs, rotary shadowed with carbon/platinum (23Engel J. Odermatt E. Engel A Madri J.A. Furthmayr H. Rohde H. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The replicas were viewed with a Philips CM 12 electron microscope. Whole mount in situlocalization of mRNA was performed using a digoxygenin-labeled RNA probe generated from clone 194.1 encoding the most 3′ 2505 bp presented in Fig. 2. The probe is made by EcoRV linearization and T3 promoter transcription of the entire insert including 2078 bp of the open reading frame and 427 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. Fixation, processing, hybridization, and visualization of the riboprobe in whole mount preparation was performed as described previously by Grenset al. (24Grens A. Mason E. Marsh J.L. Bode H.R. Development. 1995; 121: 4027-4035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Grens A. Shimizu H. Hoffmeister S.A.H. Bode H.R. Fujisawa T. Development. 1999; 126: 517-524PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hydra were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after relaxation of the polyps with 2% urethane. Specimens were subsequently treated with ethanol and proteinase K to facilitate diffusion of the probes into the epithelial bilayer. To stabilize digested tissues, specimens were refixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then prehybridized in hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's, 200 mg/ml tRNA, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% CHAPS, 100 mg/ml heparin) to block nonspecific hybridization sites. This was followed by a 48 h hybridization with the digoxygenin-labeled RNA probe and a subsequent wash in hybridization solution and 1× SSC. Specimens were next washed in MAB (100 mm maleic acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and preblocked (2–6 h) in MAB with 20% sheep serum and 1% bovine serum albumin. This was followed by the 16-h incubation at 4 °C in the same solution with anti-digoxygenin antibody (1:2000). Animals were washed eight times with MAB and then briefly in alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 50 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Specimens were then stained with BM purple alkaline phosphatase substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), dehydrated with ethanol, and mounted in euparal (Asco Laboratories).Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of full-length cDNA, as shown in Fig. 1, and deduced amino acid sequence ofH. vulgaris α1(IV) polypeptide.2 The overlapping cDNAs correspond to a 5855-nucleotide mRNA, including 159-nucleotide 5′-UTR and 521-nucleotide 3′-UTR.

This approach utilizes a localized electroporation technique (LEP) to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into the apical or basal pole of hydra. This procedure has been applied to the functional analysis of a number of hydra genes (26Yan L. Fei K.Y. Zhang J.S. Dexter S. Sarras Jr., M.P. Development. 2000; 127: 129-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yan L. Leontovich A. Fei K.Y. Sarras Jr., M.P. Dev.

Applying the LEP procedure, we tested the hypothesis that de novo biosynthesis of hydra collagen IV is required for normal head morphogenesis following decapitation. Based on the work of Dr. Richard W. Wagner (29Wagner R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 30Wagner R.W. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 1116-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Flanagen R.W. Kothavale A. Wagner R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2936-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a series of 20-mer oligonucleotides with phosphorothioate linkages were designed. Six oligonucleotides were synthesized to include four antisense sequences to portions of the 5′-UTR, initiation site, coding sequence, and 3′-UTR; a sense strand of the 5′-UTR; and a mismatch construct (the sequence of these molecules is given in the legend of Fig. 9). The oligonucleotides were introduced into hydra cells using electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser) with a micropipette drawn on a pipette puller. The ends of the micropipettes brought in contact with the hydra were polished with a micro-forge. Because hydra collagen IV is expressed in the ectoderm layer of cells, LEP was performed on the surface of the organism at the apical pole. Based on preliminary experiments, we found that decapitation had to be performed 2–4 h after LEP. This was necessary because if decapitation was performed prior to electroporation, an extensive loss of electroporated cells would occur at the cut edge of the apical pole. To maximally retain the oligonucleotides within the area where the electroporation was performed and also to reduce movement of the animal during LEP, hydra were chilled in a 10% heptanol solution (heptanol in hydra medium) for a maximum of 1 h. A 100 μmstock solution of 20-mer thiolated oligonucleotide (Genset Corp.) was mixed with FITC-dextran with aMr 10,000 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in a ratio of 3:1 (typically 6 μl of DNA + 2 μl of FITC-dextran). After fitting the micropipette over the microelectrode (World Precision Instruments, Inc.), the oligonucleotide/FITC-dextran mixture was loaded into the micropipette. The Bio-Rad gene pulser was set at 100 ohms, 25 μFD, and 50 V, and the average time for the pulse was 3.6 ms. Hydra were placed on a Nytex net attached to a plastic Petri dish with soft wax. The dish was placed on an incline to facilitate positioning of the micropipette. The micropipette was placed in contact with the ectoderm at the apical pole. After charging the gene pulser to 50 V, the pulse was initiated for a 3.6-ms period. An additional pulse could be applied if the width of the ectoderm area at the pole was greater than the micropipette diameter. To ensure that the DNA/FITC mixture was retained in cells at the apical pole after decapitation, electroporation was performed with two pulses on the ectoderm just inferior to the mouth region to make sure that a more extensive area of the apical pole received the construct. In this way, cells with the DNA/FITC mixture composed the apical pole following decapitation. The hydra were then placed in hydra medium, and at 24 h all animals were screened on a Leitz fluorescent microscope to ensure that each specimen had retained the DNA/FITC-dextran mixture at its regenerating apical pole. Electroporated hydra were observed every 24 h, and the degree of regeneration was compared with mock electroporated controls. In the current study animals were cut in the neck region just inferior to the mouth and tentacle ring. The degree of head regeneration was monitored by (i) observing the morphology of the head process under a dissection microscope and determining the degree of tentacle eruption and hypostome formation and (ii) analyzing the cellular morphology of cells of the hypostome and tentacles using Normarski optics. In controls, head regeneration is normally completed within 72 h, and, therefore, experimental groups in which blockage was observed were monitored for an additional 5 days to determine whether recovery from blockage occurred. Control animals were treated with mismatched thio-oligonucleotide 20-mer constructs (randomized sequence) or sense constructs if a particular antisense construct was found to block morphogenesis. Control and experimental groups were statistically compared using a Chi squared test and an analysis of variance test. Hydra were cultured in normal HM or in HM supplemented with either 15 mm glucose or 15 mm sorbitol for 14 days prior to being anesthetized with 10 mg/ml sodium pentobarbital to prevent body column contraction. Anesthetized organisms were fixed in 2.5% gluteraldehyde, post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide, stained with 2% uranyl acetate and 0.3% osmium tetroxide, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Animals were sectioned exactly perpendicular to the axis of the body column to produce circular rather than oval cross-sections. The body columns were sectioned near the head, at the middle, and near the base. Eight randomly selected regions from the circumference of each section were photographed, and the data from these micrographs were used to calculate the mean mesoglea thickness at each of the three locations in the body column. RNA was isolated from adult hydra that had been incubated for 48 h in HM or HM supplemented with 15 mm glucose. 2–10 hydra were added to an Eppendorf tube and 400 μl solution D (4 m guanidine thiocyanate; 0.5% sarkosyl; 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, and 0.1m β-mercaptoethanol added). The tube was vortexed for 30 s. 40 μl of 2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 400 μl of phenol, and 40 μl of chloroform were added, and the tube was briefly vortexed before incubation on ice for 15 min and centrifugation at 6,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The upper layer was transferred to a fresh tube and an equal volume of ice-cold isopropanol (propan-2-ol) was added. The tube was vortexed, incubated at −70 °C for 1 h, and spun for 30 min at 4 °C at 10,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of solution D, and 100 μl ice-cold isopropanol was added. The tube was incubated for a further hour at −70 °C and centrifuged (10,000 -g, 5 min), and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol to remove any residual salt. After air drying, the pellet was resuspended in 10–20 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. The concentration and purity of the RNA was determined by measuringA260 nm andA280 nm. Northern blotting and probing were performed as described previously (32Boot-Handford R.P. Kurkinen M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12475-12478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The previously described hydra fibrillar type I/II collagen cDNA clone HC1 (12Deutzmann R. Fowler S. Zhang X. Boone K. Dexter S. Boot-Handford R.P. Rachel R. Sarras Jr., M.P. Development. 2000; 127: 4669-4680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to screen a regenerating hydra cDNA library at low and high stringency. A clone, G4.1.2, was identified that hybridized to the fibrillar collagen probe only under conditions of low stringency. The clone was purified and found to contain 1.7 kb of interrupted collagenous sequence. Using an EcoRI restriction fragment of G4.1.2 to rescreen the library, several overlapping clones were isolated and purified that together cover the entire coding sequence of a H. vulgaris type IV collagen chain. The relationship of these clones to each other is shown in Fig. 1. The complete nucleotide sequence of hydra type IV collagen chain together with its deduced amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 2. There is a 5′-untranslated region of 159 bp, an open reading frame of 5,169 bp, and a 504 bp 3′-untranslated region. The deduced translation product of 1723 residues with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 160,000 comprises a 24-residue putative signal peptide, a short 5′ noncollagenous domain of 16 residues, a 1455-residue collagenous domain, and a 228-residue 3′ NC1 domain. The triple helical domain (residues 41–1495) contains 450 Gly-X-Y repeats interspersed with 24 noncollagenous interruptions of 1–15 residues. The primary sequence and domain sizes (TableI) are similar to other reported type IV collagen chains. The locations of three-quarters of the interruptions in the hydra collagenous domain are conserved across species (data not shown). As in other species, twice as many long imperfections (5 or more residues) occur in the N-terminal half of the hydra type IV collagenous domain. The hydra type IV collagen chain also has the single N-linked glycosylation site (Fig. 2, amino acids 122–124) conserved in other species and type IV chain types. Cysteine residues are particularly highly conserved. The 4 cysteines in the 16-residue 5′ noncollagenous domain (Fig. 2, amino acids 25–40) are also found in all other type IV chains and are required for N-terminal association of collagen IV molecules into tetramers to form the ‘7S domain'. There are five cysteine residues in the triple helical domain, mostly located in imperfections, with four being in the N-terminal half of the collagenous domain. This is comparable with other vertebrate and invertebrate chains (Table I). The C-terminal NC1 domain of hydra is the most conserved region of the molecule (Table I). The number and relative position of the cysteine residues in the NC1 domain is identical to all other type IV chains (Fig. 3) regardless of species.Table IComparison of the hydra with other vertebrate and invertebrate type IV collagen α chainsHydra α1Human α1 1-aRef. 38.Human α2 1-bRef. 39.Drosophila α1 1-cRef. 15.Drosophila α2 1-dAccession number AAB6408.C. elegansα1 1-eRef. 16.C. elegansα2 1-fRef. 40.Urchin α1 1-gRef. 17.Urchin α2 1-hRef. 18.A. suumα2 1-iRef. 41.Translation product1723166917121775176117581758175217521763Signal peptide242736232428262827265′ noncollagenous16153270161415141516Collagenous domain1455141314491456146114871486148414831487NCl domain228229227231259229231226227234Interuptions in collagenous domain24212321241715231917Cys in 5′ noncollagenous domain4443344444Cys in collagenous domain5456393433Cys in NCl domain12121212131212121212Percentage of identity in NCl domain compared to hydra α chain10058.150.445.144.655.353.558.450.554.1Domain sizes are given as numbers of amino acid residues.1-a Ref. 38Brazel D.

https://openalex.org/W2156687541,"Four members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family have been identified (GDNF, neurturin, persephin, and enovin/artemin). They bind to a specific membrane-anchored GDNF family receptor as follows: GFRα-1 for GDNF, GFRα-2 for neurturin, GFRα-3 for enovin/artemin, and (chicken) GFRα-4 for persephin. Subsequent signaling occurs through activation of a common transmembrane tyrosine kinase, cRET. GFRα-4, the coreceptor for persephin, was previously identified in chicken only. We describe the cloning and characterization of a mammalian persephin receptor GFRα-4. The novel GFRα receptor is substantially different in sequence from all known GFRαs, including chicken GFRα-4, and lacks the first cysteine-rich domain present in all previously characterized GFRαs. At least two different GFRα-4 splice variants exist in rat tissues, differing at their respective COOH termini. GFRα-4 mRNA is expressed at low levels in different brain areas in the adult as well as in some peripheral tissues including testis and heart. Recombinant rat GFRα-4 variants were expressed in mammalian cells and shown to be at least partially secreted from the cells. Persephin binds specifically and with high affinity (KD = 6 nm) to the rat GFRα-4 receptor, but no cRET activation could be demonstrated. Although the newly characterized mammalian GFRα-4 receptor is structurally divergent from previously characterized GFRα family members, we suggest that it is a mammalian orthologue of the chicken persephin receptor.

In summary, GDNF, NTN, EVN/ART, and PSP are part of a neurotrophic signaling system whereby specific high affinity ligand-binding subunits (GFRα-1 to GFRα-4) can interact with the same tyrosine kinase subunit (cRET) to elicit functional responses in neuronal cells. Persephin shares many of the neurotrophic effects previously described for GDNF and NTN (5Milbrandt J. de Sauvage F.J. Fahrner T.J. Baloh R.H. Leitner M.L. Tansey M.G. Lampe P.A. Heuckeroth R.O.

It supports the survival of motor neurons in culture and in vivo after sciatic nerve axotomy. It also promotes the survival of ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons in culture and prevents their degeneration after in vivo6-hydroxydopamine treatment. PSP further affects kidney morphogenesis, since it is able to promote ureteric bud branching. However, PSP does not support peripheral neurons from the superior cervical, dorsal root, nodose, trigeminal, or enteric ganglia. Due to the extremely low expression levels of PSP, its tissue distribution has been studied by reverse transcription PCR only (5Milbrandt J. de Sauvage F.J. Fahrner T.J. Baloh R.H. Leitner M.L.

Low level PSP mRNA expression is found throughout the embryonic and adult central nervous system and in all peripheral tissues examined (including heart, kidney, liver, skin, and muscle). The GFRα-4 coreceptor has been identified in chicken only (19Thompson J. Doxakis E. Piñón L.G.P. Strachan P. Buj-Bello A. Wyatt S. Buchman V.L. Davies A.M. Mol. Cell.

However, a functional mammalian persephin receptor has not been identified. In this paper, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel mammalian GDNF family receptor substantially different from previously described GFRαs, and we show that it is a mammalian persephin receptor GFRα-4. Similarity searching using cDNA or cDNA-derived protein sequences was carried out on the EMBL human expressed sequence tag (EST) and genomic data bases or on the proprietary LifeSeqTM and ZooSeqTM data bases (Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, CA) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST version 1.4, see Ref. 34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). The percentage identity and percentage similarity between members of the GFRα family were calculated by pairwise comparison of the sequences using the BESTFIT program (Wisconsin Package Version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI). Prediction of signal peptide cleavage was done using the SPScan program (SeqWeb version 1.1 with the Wisconsin Package Version 10.0). Gene prediction analysis on a genomic mouse GFRα-like sequence was performed with GeneHunt (Compugen, Tel Aviv, Israel) and with HMMgene (version 1.1, Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Denmark). All oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Insert-specific sequencing primers (15- and 16-mers) and primers for use in PCRs were designed manually. Sequencing reactions were done on both DNA strands using the ABI prism BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and were run on an Applied Biosystems 377XL sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The SequencherTMsoftware was used for sequence assembly and manual editing (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI). Based on novel rat GFRα EST sequences identified in a proprietary data base, oligonucleotide primers were developed for PCR amplification and 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). PCRs were performed on MarathonReadyTM cDNA (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) derived from rat brain, heart, or kidney. Since the coding sequence of the novel rat GFRα turned out to have a high GC content, a GC-rich PCR kit (CLONTECH Laboratories) was used for all amplification reactions according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR fragments were cloned (TOPO-TA cloning, Invitrogen BV, Leek, The Netherlands) and the cloned inserts sequenced. A consensus coding sequence was derived by assembling all partial sequences obtained and by excluding putative intron sequences still present in some PCR fragments but absent in others. A DNA fragment containing the full-length rat GFRα-4 coding sequence was then amplified from cDNA using primers designed at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the consensus sequence. The rat GFRα-4 coding sequence of variant A was subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen). A FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) was inserted by recombinant PCR between the predicted signal sequence and the mature coding sequence (positions 33/34 of the amino acid sequence in Fig. 1 B) for expression of a FLAG-tagged rat GFRα-4. Since both these rat GFRα-4 constructs could not be expressed at detectable levels, constructs with an improved signal sequence were made for variants A and B by recombinant PCR. Construct rGFRa4AhumsigFLAG/pcDNA3 encodes a protein containing the predicted human GFRα-4 signal sequence (amino acid residues 1–22 of the human sequence in Fig. 1 B) followed by a FLAG tag and the rat GFRα-4 variant A mature protein sequence (amino acid residues 34–273 of sequence rGFRα-4(A) in Fig. 1 B). Construct rGFRa4BhumsigFLAG/pcDNA3 encodes a protein with the same signal sequence, FLAG tag and rat GFRα-4 variant B mature protein sequence (amino acid residues 34–258 of sequence rGFRα-4(B) in Fig. 1 B). Constructs for the expression of soluble GFRα-IgGFc fusion proteins were made as follows. cDNA regions of human GFRα-1, GFRα-2, and GFRα-3, chicken GFRα-4, and rat GFRα-4 variant A (coding for amino acid residues 27–427, 20–431, 28–371, 20–399, and 29–252, respectively), excluding the sequences coding for the signal peptide and for the COOH-terminal hydrophobic region involved in GPI anchoring, were cloned in-frame in the expression vector Signal pIg plus (R & D Systems Europe Ltd, Abingdon, UK). The inserts of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The resulting proteins expressed from these constructs contain a 17-amino acid residue NH2-terminal CD33 signal peptide, the respective GFRα protein region, and a 243-amino acid residue COOH-terminal human IgG1-Fc fusion domain. Fusion proteins were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and purified as described (24Cik M. Masure S. Lesage A.S.J. Van der Linden I. Van Gompel P. Pangalos M.N. Gordon R.D. Leysen J.E.

Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)-rich RNA derived from different rodent tissues (mouse MTNTM blot, mouse embryo MTNTM blot, and rat MTNTM blot; CLONTECH Laboratories) were hybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions with an α-[32P]dCTP random priming labeled (HighPrime kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) 948-base pair (bp) fragment derived from the rat GFRα-4 coding sequence. Stringency washes were performed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C (for the mouse blots) or at 55 °C (for the rat blot). In order to check for mRNA quality and equal sample loading, blots were rehybridized with a 2-kb human β-actin cDNA control probe. The blots were exposed to Biomax-MR Scientific Imaging Film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 month (GFRα-4) or for 16 h (β-actin). A 0.45-kb DNA fragment from mouse GFRα-4 (common to all splice variants) was subcloned in vector pBS-SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the resulting vector was linearized with EcoRI. An antisense riboprobe was synthesized by in vitro transcription with T3 polymerase in the presence of 35S-UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In situ hybridization was performed on fresh-frozen 14-μm transverse sections of adult mouse (Balb/c) brain. Sections were made using a cryostat and stored at −20 °C until used. Sections were thawed at room temperature, fixed for 5 min in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and twice in distilled water, delipidated with 0.2 m HCl for 10 min, acetylated for 20 min with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m ethanolamine, and dehydrated with ethanol. After drying, the sections were prehybridized for 5 h in buffer A (50% formamide, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1m dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.1 mg/ml poly(A)-rich RNA, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 10% dextran sulfate) and then incubated overnight in a humidified chamber with 180 μl of buffer A containing 2.25 × 106 cpm/ml of mouse GFRα-4 antisense riboprobe or an unrelated control riboprobe. After hybridization, the sections were washed once in 1× SSC at 48 °C for 40 min, treated with RNase (10 mg/ml) in 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 30 min, and washed twice with 0.5× SSC and twice with 0.1× SSC for 10 min each at 37 °C. Finally, sections were dehydrated with ethanol, dried, and then dipped in Kodak NTB2 emulsion (Kodak). After a 6-week exposure at −20 °C, the slides were developed, stained lightly with cresyl violet, and mounted in Permount. A 0.95-kb rat GFRα-4 cDNA fragment (containing the full rat GFRα-4 coding sequence of variant A) and a 2.3-kb genomic fragment were used as probes in fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on rat chromosomes. A mixture of the two probes (1 μg of total DNA) was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by nick translation (Life Technologies, Inc.) producing a final probe fragment size of 200–400 bp. The labeled probe was mixed with hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate). After denaturation, the mixture was placed on metaphase rat chromosome slides (35Islam M.Q. Levan G. Hereditas. 1987; 107: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Helou K. Walther L. Günther E. Klinga-Levan K. Levan G. Immunogenetics. 1998; 47: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) denatured at 72 °C for 2 min in 70% formamide, 2× SSC. After hybridization for 48 h at 37 °C, preparations were washed for 15 min in 50% formamide, 2× SSC. Detection of labeled chromosomes was done by standard fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-digoxigenin. Chromosome spreads were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Results were derived from micrographs of 100 different cells. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed at 25 °C using a BIACORE 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Sensor chip CM5, the amine coupling kit, and buffers used were also obtained from Biacore AB. Recombinant PSP, NTN, EVN/ART, and GDNF were used as immobilized ligands. Recombinant human GDNF was obtained from R & D Systems Europe Ltd. (Abingdon, UK). NH2-terminally 6His-tagged recombinant human NTN, rat PSP, and human EVN/ART were produced inEscherichia coli as described previously (6Masure S. Geerts H. Cik M. Hoefnagel E. Tuytelaars A. Harris S.

The carboxylated matrix of a CM5 sensor chip was first activated with a 1:1 mixture of 400 mm N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 100 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide for 10 min. Recombinant neurotrophic factors were applied onto the activated surface in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5 at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Unreacted carboxyl groups were blocked with 1m ethanolamine HCl. For binding experiments, soluble GFRα-IgGFc fusion proteins were superfused using the kinject program at 30 μl/min. Concentrations of GFRα-IgGFc used in kinetic experiments were between 1 and 120 nm in Hepes-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm EDTA sodium salt, 0.005% polysorbate 20, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). The association of the GFRα receptors to the immobilized ligands was monitored for 3 min and the dissociation for 1 min, followed by regeneration with 10 mm glycine buffer. Dissociation was initiated by superfusion with Hepes-buffered saline. To improve the quality of sensor data, double referencing was used (38Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using a global analysis with the BIACORE evaluation software (version 3.0.1). Global analysis calculates the association rate (ka) and dissociation rate (kd) simultaneously, and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) is then calculated askd/ka. A simple 1:1 Langmuir model was used to fit the data. CHO cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mix F-12 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected with GFRα-4 expression constructs rGFRa4AhumsigFLAG/pcDNA3 or rGFRa4BhumsigFLAG/pcDNA3 using an optimized LipofectAMINE Plus method (24Cik M. Masure S. Lesage A.S.J.

One day post-transfection, cells were subcultured onto poly-l-lysine-coated 96-multiwell plates in 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 48 h. Cell culture supernatants were collected and concentrated 3-fold using chloroform/methanol precipitation. Cells were collected by scraping directly into Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. Concentrated supernatants and cell pellets were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–12% Bis-Tris acrylamide mini-gels under reducing conditions in MES-SDS running buffer (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C in NaCl/Pi containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk.

Here, we report a novel interaction between Cdk7 and a histidine triad (HIT) family protein, Hint/PKCI-1. This interaction was initially observed in a yeast two-hybrid study and subsequently verified by co-immunoprecipitation and subcellular localization studies, where overexpression of Cdk7 leads to partial relocalization of Hint to the nucleus. The physical association is independent of cyclin H binding or Cdk7 kinase activity and is conserved between the relatedSacharomyces cerevisiae CTD kinase Kin28 and the HIT protein Hnt1. Furthermore, combination of a disruption ofHNT1 and a KIN28 temperature-sensitive allele in S. cerevisiae led to highly elongated cell morphology and reduced colony formation, indicating a genetic interaction between KIN28 and HNT1.

Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It activates Cdks1 by phosphorylating a threonine residue in the T-loop and thus functions as the catalytic subunit of the Cdk-activating kinase (CAK). Cdk7 also regulates the functions of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) through phosphorylation of its C-terminal domain (CTD) as a part of the basal transcription factor TFIIH. The two functions of Cdk7 may be mediated via specific protein complexes, because a trimeric complex containing Cdk7 together with cyclin H and Mat1 is efficient as a CAK, whereas CTD phosphorylation is mediated more efficiently by Cdk7 within TFIIH. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the CAK and the TFIIH-associated CTD kinase activities reside in two distinct proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Kaldis P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The Kin28 kinase forms a complex with a cyclin H homologue, Ccl1, and a Mat1 homologue, Tfb3/Rig2, and functions as a TFIIH kinase phosphorylating CTD. In contrast to the mammalian complex, Kin28·Ccl1·Tfb3/Rig2 does not possess CAK activity, but instead, a monomeric CAK Cak1/Civ1 phosphorylates and activates budding yeast Cdc28 and Kin28 Cdks. The role of Cdk7/Kin28 in TFIIH appears to be involved in facilitating the processing of nascent transcripts (capping, splicing, and polyadenylation) through CTD phosphorylation (2McCracken S.

A FLAG epitope tag (Eastman Kodak Co.) was placed into pYES expression vector (Promega Biosciences, Inc., Madison, WI) between HindIII-EcoRI sites using appropriate primers introducing additional restriction sites and resulting in pYF. Other expression plasmids were generated by placing the corresponding open reading frames into p426 (19, CCL1/p426, a kind gift from D. Hermand), pYES (TFB3/RIG2/pYES, KIN28/pYES; kind gifts from D. Hermand), or pYF (HINT/pYF was subcloned from HINT/pJG4–5. HNT1/pYF was PCR-cloned with primers conferring nucleotides 13048–13034 and 12475–12461 from phage clone 70057 from ATCC, Manassas, VA). Immunoprecipitations from yeast lysates with the indicated proteins and the subsequent kinase assays and Western blotting analysis were performed as described (20Damagnez V. Makela T.P. Cottarel G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6164-6172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using monoclonal α-HA (12CA5, Babco Inc., Berkeley, CA) or α-FLAG (M5, Kodak) antibodies. For bacterial expression, an EcoRI-XhoI insert from HINT/pJG4–5 was cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate recombinant protein as described (16Mäkelä T.P. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1994; 371: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Subsequently 1.5 mg of U2OS human osteosarcoma cell extracts in ELB lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 5 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) were incubated with 5 μg of GST or GST-Hint for 1 h at 4 °C, bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h, and washed four times with ELB. Bound proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with polyclonal α-Cdk7 antibody (21Mäkelä T.P. Parvin J.D. Kim J. Huber L.J. Sharp P.A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5174-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). U2OS osteosarcoma cells were cultured using standard protocols and transfected with the calcium phosphate transfection method (22Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.33-16.36Google Scholar) using plasmids with CDK7 or HA-tagged HINT cDNAs in pCINeo (Promega). Transfected cells were fixed on coverslips with 3.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Double immunofluorescence was performed using rabbit polyclonal α-Cdk7 or mouse monoclonal α-HA (12CA5) followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat α-rabbit and fluorescein-conjugated goat α-mouse secondary antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma; 0.5 μg/ml), and the immunostainings were viewed and documented with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. We were interested in characterizing novel proteins interacting with the Cdk7 kinase. For this purpose, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using LexA-Cdk7 bait with the same strategy that had previously led to the identification of cyclin H (16Mäkelä T.P. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1994; 371: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Screening of both HeLa and human keratinocyte cDNA libraries consistently led to the observation of characteristic small, intensely blue colonies (ignored in a previous screen (16Mäkelä T.P. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1994; 371: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)) that were found at a higher frequency than cyclin H. A streak from a representative clone is shown in Fig.1 A. Subsequent sequencing of the corresponding cDNAs indicated that these clones represented independent cDNAs of a gene termed either PKCI-1(protein kinase C inhibitor-1 (23Pearson J.D. DeWald D.B.

Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As PKCI-1/Hint apparently is not a protein kinase C inhibitor (25Fraser E.D. Walsh M.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Klein M.G. Yao Y. Slosberg E.D. Lima C.D. Doki Y. Weinstein I.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it is referred to here as Hint. All identified HINT clones contained the entire open reading frame, suggesting that a full-length Hint is required for the interaction. To date, Hint is the only other characterized human HIT protein in addition to the tumor suppressor FHIT (27Ohta M. Inoue H. Cotticelli M.G. Kastury K. Baffa R. Palazzo J. Siprashvili Z. Mori M. McCue P. Druck T. et al.Cell. 1996; 84: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Likewise, the budding yeast genome has only two HIT proteins, where HNT1 (28Frohlich K.U. Fries H.W. Rudiger M. Erdmann R. Botstein D. Mecke D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) andHNT2/APH1 (29Brevet A. Chen J. Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5275-5279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) represent homologues of HINT andFHIT, respectively. FHIT proteins have been shown to be involved in nucleotide metabolism (30Barnes L.D.

J. 1997; 326: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and to hydrolyze ADP in vitro(34Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). 2N. Korsisaari and T. P. Mäkelä, unpublished results. As S. cerevisiae genes KIN28 and HNT1represent apparent homologues of CDK7 and HINT, respectively, we subsequently tested whether the two-hybrid interaction was conserved from man to yeast. To this end, we used LexA-Kin28 and B42-Hnt1 proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system, noting that expression of these proteins also activated the lacZreporter (Fig. 1 A). We next investigated whether the HIT proteins could be detected in Cdk7 or Kin28 immunocomplexes (Fig. 1 B). We expressed HA epitope-tagged HA-Cdk7, HA-Kin28, HA-Hint, or HA-Hnt1 together with FLAG epitope-tagged FLAG-Hint or FLAG-Hnt1 in yeast cells in the combinations indicated in Fig. 1 B. Complex formation was subsequently assessed by immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged proteins followed by Western blotting with α-FLAG antibodies. The results demonstrate that FLAG-Hint and FLAG-Hnt1 co-immunoprecipitate with HA-Cdk7 (Fig. 1 B, lane 5) and HA-Kin28 (Fig.1 B, lane 6), respectively. Structural studies have demonstrated that Hint forms homodimers (24Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Weinstein I.B. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5357-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This was also noted in our co-immunoprecipitation studies, where both FLAG-Hint and FLAG-Hnt1 efficiently co-precipitated with the corresponding HA-tagged proteins (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). The yeast and human HIT orthologues were also able to form a complex with each other (data not shown), indicating structural conservation between Hint and Hnt1 with 34% identity at the amino acid level. An association between Hint and endogenous mammalian Cdk7 could also be demonstrated, as Cdk7 specifically co-purified with a GST-Hint protein from mammalian cell lysates (Fig. 1 C). The evolutionary conservation of the interactions on one hand between human Cdk7 (a CAK and a CTD kinase) and Hint and on the other hand between yeast Kin28 (exclusively a CTD kinase) and Hnt1 suggests that the interaction is functionally significant. To address this possibility, we initially characterized the ability of Hint to associate with Cdk7 mutants using the two-hybrid assay (Fig.2 A). Using the well characterized interaction between Cdk7 and cyclin H as a comparison, it was first noted that the Cdk7-Hint interaction appeared to be stronger based on lacZ expression (Fig. 2 A,top panels). As previously noted for cyclin H (16Mäkelä T.P. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1994; 371: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), Hint also efficiently associated with a kinase-deficient Cdk7 (Cdk7-K41M), although Hint did not associate with an N-terminally deleted Cdk7 (Cdk7Δ1–132). Hint association was also observed with a Cdk7 in which the T-loop activation site threonine had been mutated to glutamic acid (Cdk7-T170E) in an attempt to mimic phosphorylation of this site. As cyclin H was previously demonstrated not to associate with the T170E mutant (16Mäkelä T.P. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1994; 371: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), the results indicate that the Hint-Cdk7 interaction is independent of cyclin H binding. On the other hand, Hint-associated Cdk7 retained its kinase activity (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the association of Hint with Cdk7 does not exclude cyclin binding, which is required for Cdk7's kinase activity. This was further supported by the demonstration of Hint in cyclin H immunocomplexes in yeast cells also expressing Cdk7 (Fig. 2 C). Thus, Hint apparently does not represent a Cdk inhibitor; rather it may be associated with modifying Cdk7 substrate specificity, as suggested by the preferential phosphorylation of a RNA Pol II CTD substrate by Hint-associated Cdk7 (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Cdk7-Hint interaction is independent of Cdk7 kinase activity and cyclin H binding.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or a nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in rat basophilic leukemic cells (37Razin E. Zhang Z.C. Nechushtan H. Frenkel S. Lee Y.N. Arudchandran R. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34272-34276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas Cdk7 is exclusively a nuclear protein (38Tassan J.P. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Hint and Cdk7 could be detected in the same subcellular compartments, U2OS human osteosarcoma cells were transfected with an HA-Hint-expressing plasmid alone or together with a Cdk7-expressing plasmid and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 3). In both cases, HA-Hint protein was detected throughout the cell including nuclei with a prominent perinuclear staining (Fig. 3 A). However, in some cells also overexpressing Cdk7, HA-Hint staining was more prominent in the nuclei, where it co-localized with Cdk7 (Fig. 3 D). This result demonstrates that overexpression of Cdk7 leads to redistribution of Hint in mammalian cells, perhaps because of the formation of direct complexes between these proteins. The results also demonstrate that in addition to the co-localization of Hint with Cdk7 in the nucleus, a significant fraction of Hint is cytoplasmic, suggesting that Hint is likely to be involved in additional functions not related to Cdk7. This suggestion is in line with previous studies identifying interactions between Hint and the ATDC(ataxia telangiectasia group D -complementing) gene product (18Brzoska P.M. Chen H. Zhu Y. Levin N.A. Disatnik M.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Murnane J.P. Christman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34272-34276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The extension of the association of Cdk7 and Hint to the S. cerevisiae Kin28 and Hnt1 proteins, together with the availability of temperature-sensitive alleles of KIN28 (15Valay J.G. Simon M. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), prompted us to investigate whether KIN28 and HNT1 displayed genetic interactions. This analysis was initiated by generating yeast strain NKK1 in which a HIS3 selection cassette replaced amino acids 14–146 (of 158) of HNT1 (Fig.4 A). The haploid disruptant strain proved to be viable and exhibited no apparent phenotype, indicating that HNT1 is not an essential gene. Subsequently, a double mutant haploid strain, NKK2, was generated harboring the disruption of HNT1 together with a KIN28temperature-sensitive allele kin28-ts3 (JGV4, a kind gift from G. Faye (15Valay J.G. Simon M. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). Analysis of the double mutant haploid indicated decreased colony formation compared with either parental strain at 30 °C (Fig.4 B). Microscopic examination of the double mutant cells at 30 °C revealed highly elongated cells forming clusters or filaments in which daughter cells had apparently remained attached to mother cells (Fig. 4 C). This morphology was suppressed by ectopic expression of Hnt1 or Kin28 (Fig. 4 C, lower panels). Also, expression of the human Hint completely suppressed the phenotype (Fig. 4 C, lower right panel) strongly suggesting complementation of HNT1 byHINT. The earlier observation that Hint and Hnt1 can form physical complexes is in agreement with this notion. Partial suppression was noted by expression of the Ccl1 cyclin, but expression of Tfb3/Rig2 did not rescue the morphology (data not shown). These results provide genetic evidence to support the interaction between Kin28 and Hnt1. The morphology of the double mutant strain is somewhat reminiscent of diploid pseudohyphal growth (39Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), but the cells did not display invasive properties (data not shown). In addition, the morphology was more prominent when galactose was used as a carbon source, suggesting that the phenotype is related to metabolic stress and may involve improper control of the Ras/cyclic AMP pathway function (40Stanhill A. Schick N. Engelberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7529-7538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Further studies to investigate this possibility are under way. The identification of physical and genetic interactions between the Cdk7 and Kin28 CTD kinases with the Hint and Hnt1 HIT proteins is interesting in the light of a recent report indicating that Hint associates with and negatively regulates the microphthalmia transcription factor mi (37Razin E.

It raises the possibility that HIT proteins may bridge the interactions between basal transcription factors and transcription activators.

https://openalex.org/W2088553469,"Synthesis of the minus strand of viral DNA by human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase is accompanied by RNase H degradation of the viral RNA genome. RNA fragments remain after synthesis and are degraded by the polymerase-independent mode of RNase H cleavage. Recently, we showed that this mode of cleavage occurs by a specific ordered mechanism in which primary cuts are first, secondary and 5-nucleotide cuts are next, and second primary cuts occur last (Wisniewski, M., Balakrishnan, M., Palaniappan, C., Fay, P., J., and Bambara, R., A. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.97, 11978–11983). Ultimately the RNAs are cleaved into small fragments that can dissociate from the DNA template. Because the cleavage mechanism is an ordered series of events, we determined in this study whether any earlier cut is required for a later cut. By precisely inhibiting cleavage at each site, we examined the dependence of later cuts on cleavage at that site. We found that each cut is independent of the other cuts, demonstrating that the order of this stepwise mechanism is based on the rates of each cut. A mechanism for unlinked ordered cleavage consistent with these results is presented."

This work describes the second unique structure of a thrombin-substrate complex, reveals conserved structural features as well as conformational differences in substrate and enzyme, and extends understanding of thrombin-substrate interactions. Factor XIII is a transglutaminase and the last enzyme to be activated in the blood coagulation cascade. The zymogen circulates in human plasma as a heterotetramer of two catalytic A-subunits and two carrier B-subunits and is found intracellularly in platelets, megakaryocytes, and macrophages as an A2 dimer (17Folk J.E.

Res. 1999; 94: 271-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Factor XIII is activated by thrombin, which cleaves the A-subunit between Arg37 and Gly38, releasing the N-terminal activation peptide in the presence of Ca2+ ions (21Lorand L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 485: 144-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Hornyak T.J. Bishop P.D. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7326-7332Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The activated enzyme catalyzes the formation of γ-glutamyl-ε-lysyl amide cross-links between polypeptide chains in adjacent fibrin molecules, rendering the blood clot mechanically stable and resistant to fibrinolysis. The residues surrounding the thrombin cleavage site in factor XIII are of particular interest. Val34 has drawn much recent attention, because a common Leu34 polymorphism has been associated with a lower incidence of myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease (23Kohler H.P.

In addition, the Val34Leu polymorphism was found to be more common in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage in one study (28Catto A.J. Kohler H.P. Bannan S. Stickland M. Carter A. Grant P.J. Stroke. 1998; 29: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and to be less common in patients with brain infarction in another (29Elbaz A. Poirier O. Canaple S. Chedru F. Cambien F.

Recombinant and purified factor XIII Leu34variant has a significantly higher specific activity than the Val form (30Kangsadalampai S. Board P.G.

The proximity of Val34 to the thrombin cleavage site at Arg37suggests that the Leu34 substitution may affect thrombin cleavage and be responsible thus for the difference in activation and specific activity (33Ariens R.A.S.

Crystal structures of factor XIII A2 in zymogen, thrombin-cleaved, and Ca2+-bound forms have been determined (35Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl.

In all structures, the 37-residue N-terminal activation peptide remains in the same position and conformation with respect to the rest of the molecule, even after thrombin cleavage or cation binding. As well, in all structures the activation peptide near the Arg37 cleavage site is highly disordered and poorly defined in the electron density maps. The present crystal structure of the factor XIII-(28–37) decapeptide bound to human α-thrombin reveals the detailed atomic level interactions between the activation peptide and thrombin and provides the first high resolution view of this functionally important part of the factor XIII molecule. Human α-thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc., South Bend, IN) and the factor XIII (fXIII1) peptide as a chloromethylketone derivative (Thr28-Val29-Glu30-Leu31-Gln32-Gly33-Val34-Val35-Pro36-Arg37-CMK, AnaSpec, Inc., San Jose, CA) were obtained from commercial sources. The enzyme was concentrated to 8 mg/ml and mixed with a 10-fold molar excess of peptide dissolved in water. Crystals of the thrombin-peptide complex were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at room temperature, from 24% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 200 mm sodium chloride in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.5. Typically crystals grow to full size in about 2 weeks, to maximum dimensions of 0.1 × 0.2 × 0.4 mm. A crystal stabilized in a cryoprotectant containing 15% glycerol was cooled in a stream of cold nitrogen (−180 °C) for data collection. Diffraction data were collected on an in-house Rigaku R-AXIS IV imaging plate system using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) from a Rigaku H3R rotating anode x-ray generator operated at 50 kV, 100 mA and equipped with Yale focusing mirrors. A total of 127 images was collected with 60-min exposure, 1.5° oscillation step, and a crystal-detector distance of 100 mm. Data to 2.0-Å resolution were processed using the HKL program suite (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar); data processing statistics are listed in Table I. The unit cell parameters are a = 54.07, b = 81.26, c = 85.46 Å, and β = 101.62° with space group P21. The calculated Matthews number of 2.7 (39Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar) corresponds to a solvent content of 55% and Z = 4, indicating that there are two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit.Table IData collection and final refinement statisticsData collection Resolution range (Å)20.0–2.0(2.07–2.0) 1-aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution bin.

Open table in a new tab The structure was solved by molecular replacement (40Rossmann M.G. Blow D.M. Acta Crystallogr. 1962; 15: 24-31Crossref Google Scholar) using the program AMoRe (41Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar), with human α-thrombin coordinates from the 1.6-Å resolution crystal structure of its complex with hirugen and p-amidinophenylpyruvate, and Protein Data Bank code 1AHT (10Chen Z. Li Y. Mulichak A.M. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as the search model. The cross rotation calculation showed two peaks with correlation coefficients 34.5% and 28.3%, respectively, which were significantly higher than the rest. Translation function calculations for these peaks gave two clear solutions and the overall correlation coefficient increased to 61.3% with an R factor of 37.0%. Rigid body refinement gave a correlation coefficient and R factor of 69.9% and 33.4%, respectively, for 10.0- to 3.5-Å resolution data and indicated the solution was correct. A rigid body refinement with the two molecules in the asymmetric unit treated as independent rigid groups was then carried out using X-PLOR (42Brunger A.T. XPLOR version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The model was refined further by the gradual extension of data to 2.0-Å resolution, alternating with manual model fitting to the 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ and ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ electron density maps using the program O (43Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). A molecular dynamics refinement using the simulated annealing technique was also carried out. The fXIII-(28–37) residues initially built into 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ and ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ omit electron density contoured at 1.0 and 2.5 ς, respectively (Fig. 1), before being included in the refinement. Water molecules were selected from ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ peaks higher than 4ς; the sodium ions were selected from positive ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ peaks, which corresponded to the binding site characterized elsewhere (44Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 45Zhang E. Tulinsky A. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 63: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These positions were checked after each cycle of refinement and retained only if the electron density remained clear in the 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ map. The final R and free R values are 19.3% and 25.6%, respectively, for 10- to 2.0-Å resolution data. The model quality was checked using PROCHECK (46Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and DDQ (47van den Akker F. Hol W.G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All the main-chain torsion angles for non-glycine and non-proline residues are within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (48Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). The refinement and geometric parameters are given in Table I. The asymmetric unit consists of two thrombin molecules (MOL1 and MOL2), two peptide molecules (PEP1 and PEP2), 479 waters, and 2 sodium ions. The residue numbering in thrombin is based on that of chymotrypsin (7Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Peptide residues are numbered 28 to 37 to conform to the intact factor XIII sequence. Terminal residues 1H–1B and 14L–15 in the thrombin light chain and residues 245–247 and 148–149E in the heavy chain lack continuous and well defined electron density, and were not included in the model. Well defined electron density was observed for PEP1 (Fig. 1) and the C-terminal portion of PEP2. However the electron density for N-terminal residues 28–30 of PEP2 was found be relatively weak, as reflected in high B factors (Table I). The structures of the two thrombin molecules observed in this complex crystal are quite similar to other thrombin crystal structures reported in the literature. The r.m.s. deviation for the Cα atoms of the first and second molecules from those of the initial search model are 0.59 and 0.46 Å, respectively, whereas the r.m.s. deviation between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit is 0.51 Å. The two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit of this crystal structure participate in substantially different crystal packing interactions. MOL1 participates in 323 intermolecular contacts (≤4.0 Å) with its 6 surrounding protein molecules, whereas only 175 such contacts with 4 surrounding protein molecules are observed for MOL2. The tight packing of MOL1 compared with MOL2 in the crystal structure is also reflected in the different average B factors for the two molecules of 22.6 and 35.5 Å2, respectively (Table I). The fXIII-(28–37) peptides PEP1 and PEP2 are bound to thrombin molecules MOL1 and MOL2, respectively. The two peptides have roughly the same backbone conformation: the r.m.s. deviation of the ten Cα atoms after superposition of the two peptides is 0.75 Å. Side-chain atoms of N-terminal residues show considerable conformational differences between the two peptides, as evidenced by a high r.m.s. deviation for all atoms between the two peptides of 1.80 Å. The C-terminal segment Val34-Arg37 of the peptides adopts an extended β-sheet arrangement with main-chain hydrogen bonds with thrombin and runs anti-parallel to the Ser214-Glu217 segment of the enzyme (Fig.2). The peptide N-terminal residues Thr28 to Gln32 form a short stretch of irregular α-helix with main-chain hydrogen bonds between residues Thr28-Leu31, (Thr28-Gln32 in the case of PEP2), Val29-Gln32, and Glu30-Gly33. The N-terminal segment folds back toward the active site cleft and Gly33 facilitates this folding, bringing Val29 and Val34, rather distant along the peptide chain, close enough to form main-chain hydrogen bonds. The hydrophobic side chains of both these valine residues are in close proximity and point in the same direction. The side chains of residues Thr28, Glu30, and Leu31 are clustered together and point in the opposite direction. This arrangement gives a compact structure for the segment Thr28-Val34 (Fig. 1). TableII lists the hydrogen bond interactions between the peptide and thrombin in each complex; MOL1-PEP1 interactions are illustrated in Fig. 2. Arg37 makes a number of hydrogen bonds with the thrombin residues constituting the active site cleft. It forms main-chain hydrogen bonds with thrombin residues Ser214, Gly193, and Ser195; its side chain participates in hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly219 and side-chain oxygen atoms of Asp189. Glu192 of MOL2 swings in to interact with both Arg37 and Pro36 in PEP2. The peptide structure is stabilized also by two water hydrogen bonds in the specificity pocket. These hydrogen bonds are made by N-ε and N-H1 of Arg37. Other interactions include Val35in the peptide forming main-chain hydrogen bonds with Gly216 of thrombin, and the terminal nitrogen of Thr28 hydrogen bonding to thrombin's carbonyl oxygen of Arg97. A large number of van der Waals interactions (≤4.0 Å) also are observed between the peptide and the enzyme molecule, as schematically represented in Fig. 3.Table IIPeptide-thrombin hydrogen bondsPeptide atomThrombin atomDistanceMolecule 1Molecule 2ÅThr28NArg97O3.113.01Thr28NGln38O-ε23.26 2-aHydrogen bonds between PEP1 and MOL2, resulting from the crystal packing.

Both the peptides make hydrogen bonds with the enzyme to which it is attached. Significant differences in crystal contacts involving the N-terminal regions of the two fXIII-(28–37) peptides are observed. In PEP1, the peptide nitrogen of Thr28 and terminal nitrogen of Gln32 hydrogen bond to O-ε1 of Gln38 in MOL2; Gln32 also hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of Lys36 in MOL2. In addition, a number of van der Waals interactions are observed between PEP1 and MOL2. Thr28, Glu30, Leu31, and Gln32 in PEP1 make contacts with Lys36, Gln38, Leu65, Arg67, Tyr76, and Ile82 in MOL2. In contrast, no intermolecular interactions are observed between PEP2 and MOL1. The lack of these stabilizing crystal contacts partially explains the high B factors for PEP2. It should be noted that MOL2 also has a higher average B factor than MOL1. The carbonyl carbon atom of fXIII-(28–37)'s P1 residue Arg37 makes a hemiketal bond with the active site residue Ser195 O-γ, and is also linked to His57N-ε2 through a methylene, because the original peptide was derivatized with a reactive chloromethylketone group. The Arg37 side chain occupies the S12 specificity pocket, whereas Pro36 fills the S2 subsite. The side chain of the P3 residue Val35 points toward the bulk solvent, away from the apolar binding site. Instead, the aryl binding site of thrombin is occupied by fXIII-(28–37)'s hydrophobic residues Val34 and Val29. The final structure contains 489 water molecules and two sodium ions. Each sodium ion coordinates with carbonyl oxygen atoms of Arg221A and Lys224 in a thrombin molecule. The waters which surround each sodium ion are part of a solvent cluster that occupies an internal cavity enclosed by residues Tyr184A-Gly188, Asp221-Tyr224, and Asp189, as reported earlier (44Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 45Zhang E. Tulinsky A. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 63: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This cluster and its linkage to the bulk water has previously been suggested as a route to expel water molecules through the back of the specificity pocket upon insertion of a P1 side chain during substrate/inhibitor binding. Among the many other water clusters also observed in the current structure is a large clustering of solvent molecules between the two thrombin molecules in the asymmetric unit. Many of these water molecules are hydrogen bound to exosite II residues Arg126, Asp178, and Arg233 of MOL1 and Lys135, Glu164, Asp186A, Glu186B, and Lys186D of MOL2. The structure of this thrombin-fXIII-(28–37) complex can be compared with that of the only other substrate complexes studied, those of fibrinopeptide A-(7–16) (FPA) bound to α-thrombin (15Stubbs M.T. Oschkinat H. Mayer I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The fXIII-(28–37) and FPA follow roughly the same backbone conformation (Fig. 4) despite the fact that the sequence identity between the two peptides is only 20%. The r.m.s deviations of the Cα atoms between FPA and PEP1, and between FPA and PEP2, are 1.00 and 0.57 Å, respectively. Although PEP1 and PEP2 show similar r.m.s deviations from FPA for P1–P5 residues after superposition of this segment (0.47 and 0.52 Å), the PEP1 shows a larger deviation (0.69 Å) than PEP2 (0.33 Å) in the case of N-terminal residues. The difference in similarity between the two fXIII-(28–37) peptides and FPA may not be significant given the higher B-factors and likely greater positional uncertainty for the atoms in PEP2. A comparison of the fXIII-(28–37) with PPACK bound to thrombin (7Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) shows that residues P1–P3 superimpose well. This indicates that the C-terminal residues, which are bound to the active site cleft and also involved in the hydrogen bonding with the enzyme, have essentially the identical conformation in fXIII-(28–37), FPA, and PPACK. The arginine side chain of PPACK fills the specificity pocket, and the proline is encapsulated in a hydrophobic cage. The same mode of interaction is observed between the P1 Arg37 residue and thrombin in the FPA and fXIII-(28–37) complexes. The P2 residues, Pro36 in fXIII-(28–37) and Val15 in FPA, occupy the same position as proline in PPACK. Thus the conformations of the C-terminal residues in fXIII-(28–37) and in FPA are determined mainly by the active site geometry of thrombin, because this region has direct, specific interactions with the enzyme. The N-terminal residues, however, have only weak van der Waals interactions with thrombin and are not engulfed by thrombin molecules to give a tight packing. One probable reason for the observed folding of the substrate peptides is the stability offered by the clustering and burial of hydrophobic residues, rather distant along the peptide chain, in the apolar binding site. In PPACK, the benzyl side chain of D-Phe fills the residual part of the hydrophobic cavity called the aryl binding site (6Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The side chain of a substrate's l-amino acid at the P3 position would interact with a different thrombin site as compared with that of PPACK. In the fXIII-(28–37), the side chain of P3 residue Val35 points toward the bulk solvent, and the side chain of P4 residue Val34 occupies the aryl binding site instead. Based on modeling studies, it has been suggested that the side chain of anl-stereoisomer at P3 would extend into bulk solvent due to steric hindrance by the P2 side chain and the Trp60D indole group of thrombin (7Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), and probably the side chain of the P4 residue in a polypeptide substrate would point toward the apolar binding site (6Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Because the P3 and P4 residues in FPA are glycines, this fXIII-(28–37) structure provides the first experimental confirmation for this prediction of substrate conformation when bound to thrombin. The aryl binding site in the fXIII-(28–37) complex is occupied by the aliphatic side chains of P9 residue Val29 and P4 residue Val34 and is bordered by the side chains of thrombin residues Tyr60A, Ile174, Trp215, and Glu217, and main-chain atoms of residues Arg97-Asn98 and Gly216. In the case of FPA, the P9 residue Phe8 occupies almost the same relative position as Val29, and the P8 residue Leu9 is displaced from both the Val29 and Val34 positions in fXIII-(28–37) (Fig.5). The crystal structure of the thrombin-hirudin complex (8Rydel T.J. Ravichandran K.G. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. Roitsch C. Fenton J.W., II Science. 1990; 249: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) shows that the phenolic side chain of the inhibitor's Tyr3 is located in the aryl binding site (Fig.5). Finally, the naphthyl and tosyl moieties of benzamidine-derived inhibitors, and other aromatic groups in synthetic inhibitors interact in a similar favorable manner with this apolar site (6Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 49Matsuzaki T. Sasaki T. Okumura C. Umeyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 949-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 50Bode W. Turk D. Sturzebecher J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 51Turk D.

J. 1997; 326: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present crystal structure, Ile174 shows side-chain conformational differences and a shift of about 1 Å compared with thrombin in complexes with FPA or PPACK (Fig.6). This may be due to the steric bulk of the Val34 side chain in the aryl binding site. In addition, Trp215 shows a slight shift in its position. Therefore, a bulkier side chain at P4 position may not be a favorable condition for the observed conformation of the substrate peptides. We have modeled a leucine residue in place of Val34 and have calculated distances to surrounding atoms. This calculation showed that the Leu34 side chain in various orientations makes unfavorable short contacts with either thrombin or N-terminal segments of the peptide or both. Thrombin residues that are involved in these short contacts are Glu217, Ile174, Trp215, and Gly216, and peptide residues involved are Val29 and Gln32. The short contacts between the modeled Leu34 and Val29 of the peptide indicate that the Val34Leu mutation likely leads to a different peptide conformation. Eventually this may affect properties of factor XIII as a substrate. For example, in the crystal structure of thrombin bound to fibrinopeptide A with phenylalanine replaced by the larger tyrosine at P9, a disordered peptide conformation results (52Malkowski M.G. Martin P.D. Lord S.T. Edwards B.F.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The observed peptide conformation is incompatible with nucleophilic attack by the catalytic Ser195 and explains how the bulkier tyrosine mutation renders the peptide a less susceptible substrate. Finally, the side-chain arrangement of Glu30 in fXIII-(28–37) is different from that of the corresponding Leu9 in FPA. Although the hydrophobic side chain of leucine in FPA folds toward the apolar binding site, the charged Glu30 side chain in fXIII-(28–37) points toward the bulk solvent (Fig. 4). In FPA Glu11 makes salt bridges with Arg173 of thrombin. This interaction has been thought of as an important factor for the binding of fibrinogen to thrombin (15Stubbs M.T. Oschkinat H. Mayer I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Martin P.D. Robertson W. Turk D. Huber R. Bode W. Edwards B.F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7911-7920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fXIII-(28–37), the corresponding residue Gln32 adopts a different side-chain conformation and makes only a few van der Waals interactions with thrombin. The loss of binding energy due to the absence of this peptide-thrombin electrostatic interaction may be at least partially compensated by the dual hydrophobic insertions into the aryl binding site in the fXIII-(28–37) complex. It has been observed that glycine at P5 position is conserved in fibrinogen, and a non-glycine residue would be unfavorable to the observed peptide folding (15Stubbs M.T. Oschkinat H. Mayer I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Martin P.D. Robertson W. Turk D. Huber R. Bode W. Edwards B.F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7911-7920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fXIII-(28–37) also, the P5 position is occupied by a glycine and adopts a similar main-chain conformation. This confirms an important role for glycine at P5 for substrate conformation and thus for substrate-thrombin interaction. The fXIII-(28–37)- and FPA-bound thrombin crystal structures, along with those for inhibitor complexes, highlight the several important determinants of thrombin substrate structure. First, the P1 and P2 residues must be compatible with the geometry and chemistry of the S1 and S2 specificity sites in thrombin. Second, a glycine in the P5 position is necessary for the conserved substrate conformation seen in both fXIII-(28–37) and FPA. Finally, the hydrophobic residues, which occupy the aryl binding site determine the substrate conformation further away from the catalytic residues. In FPA, the P8 residue Leu9 occupies the aryl binding site and interacts with thrombin's apolar binding site, but a similar interaction was not observed for the corresponding Glu30 in fXIII-(28–37). In the case of fibrinopeptide A, a hydrophobic P9 residue is crucial for thrombin cleavage; a bulkier residue in this position disrupts the geometry necessary for nucleophilic attack by Ser195 and makes the peptide a less favorable substrate (52Malkowski M.G. Martin P.D. Lord S.T. Edwards B.F.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the case of fXIII-(28–37), the aryl binding site is shared by hydrophobic residues P4 (Val34) and P9 (Val29)."

For this purpose, we designed a mutant for ε subunit similar to the one constructed by Schulenberg and Capaldi (Schulenberg, B., and Capaldi, R. A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 28351–28355). We introduced two cysteine residues at the interface of N-terminal β-sandwich domain (S48C) and C-terminal α-helical domain (N125C) of ε subunit. The α3β3γε complex containing the reduced form of this mutant ε subunit showed suppressed ATPase activity and gradual activation during the measurement. This activation pattern was similar to the complex with the wild type ε subunit. The conformation of the mutant ε subunit must be fixed and similar to the reported three-dimensional structure of the isolated ε subunit, when the intramolecular disulfide bridge was formed on this subunit by oxidation. This oxidized mutant ε subunit could form the α3β3γε complex but did not show any inhibitory effect. The complex was converted to the activated state, and the cross-link in the mutant ε subunit in the complex was efficiently formed in the presence of ATP-Mg, whereas no cross-link was observed without ATP-Mg, suggesting the conformation of the oxidized mutant ε subunit must be similar to that in the activated state complex. A non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate, could stimulate the formation of the cross-link on the ε subunit. Furthermore, the cross-link formation was stimulated by nucleotides even when this mutant ε subunit was assembled with a mutant α3β3γ complex lacking non-catalytic sites. These results indicate that binding of ATP to the catalytic sites induces a conformational change in the ε subunit and triggers transition of the complex from the suppressed state to the activated state.

In the case of F0F1 complex from eukaryotic organella, several regulation systems are known (24Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol.

Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 269-291Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, mitochondrial F0F1 has a specific ATPase inhibitor protein and its cooperative proteins (24Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3762-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,25Hashimoto T. Yoshida Y. Tagawa K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When the activity of respiratory chain decreases, these proteins prevent ATP synthesis/hydrolysis activity of F0F1 and thus maintain both the electrochemical potential across the membrane and the ATP level in the cell (26Hashimoto T. Shiroiwa M. Ichikawa N. Yoshida Y. Tagawa K. Seikagaku. 1996; 68: 775Google Scholar). In chloroplast F0F1, the activity is controlled both by the electrochemical potential of protons which activates the enzyme and by the redox state in the chloroplast which controls the activity of the enzyme through the formation and the cleavage of a disulfide bond on the γ subunit (reviewed in Ref. 27Ort D.R. Oxborough K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 269-291Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). InEscherichia coli F0F1, ε subunit is a unique endogenous inhibitor of the ATPase activity (22Laget P.P. Smith J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 197: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the function is more obvious in the partial complex, F1(23Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Recently, we found that the ε subunit of thermophilic F1(TF1)1modulates the activity of TF1 (28Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and further the holoenzyme, TF0F1 (29Kato-Yamada Y. Bald D. Koike M. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33991-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). From these results, we concluded that F0F1 has two different states that are mutually convertible by a function and/or a certain conformational change of the ε subunit. This finding led us to propose the possible role of the ε subunit in a regulatory system of F0F1. However, there is no direct evidence for the movement or the conformational change in the ε subunit in the complex accompanying this conversion, and the molecular mechanism of the inhibition by the ε subunit is still unclear.The structure of the isolated ε subunit of E. coliF1-ATPase has been solved both by NMR and by x-ray crystallography (30Wilkens S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28351-28355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have suggested from the biochemical studies that the structure of the ε subunit in F0F1 is essentially the same as that of the isolated ε subunit. In the recently reported partial structure of F0F1 from yeast mitochondria (34Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), the δ subunit (equivalent to the ε subunit of bacterial F0F1) lies on the top of the 10 c subunit ring which is far from the bottom part of the α3β3 ring including the DELSEED region of the β subunit. Although the resolution of this structure is limited to 3.9 Å, the electron density from the δ subunit fits well with the reported structure of the isolated ε subunit from E. coliF1-ATPase (30Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M.

On the contrary, the interaction between DELSEED region of β subunit and C-terminal domain of ε subunit has been suggested from cross-linking studies (21Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Taken together, a rearrangement of the ε subunit in the complex and/or drastic conformational changes in F0F1or ε subunit itself is supposed to occur during the conversion from the suppressed state to the activated state. Actually, the change in the position of the ε subunit in the complex and the conformational change in this subunit itself during the catalytic turnover are also suggested (21Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A.

Similar mutant ε subunits of E. coli F1 were already constructed by Schulenberg and Capaldi (33Schulenberg B. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28351-28355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). By using these mutants, they have concluded that the structure of the ε subunit in the intact F0F1 should resemble that determined for the isolated ε subunit. They also discussed that the relative movement of the domains in the ε subunit is not required for the functioning of F0F1, although they have pointed out the modulation of the activity of F0F1 by the ε subunit.Our results indicate that the ε subunit should be in different conformation from the reported structure (30Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M.

The latter must be similar to that of the isolated ε subunit. Furthermore, we concluded that the ATP binding to the catalytic site(s) is a trigger for the transition from the suppressed state to the activated state.

Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 269-291Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, mitochondrial F0F1 has a specific ATPase inhibitor protein and its cooperative proteins (24Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3762-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,25Hashimoto T. Yoshida Y. Tagawa K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When the activity of respiratory chain decreases, these proteins prevent ATP synthesis/hydrolysis activity of F0F1 and thus maintain both the electrochemical potential across the membrane and the ATP level in the cell (26Hashimoto T. Shiroiwa M. Ichikawa N. Yoshida Y. Tagawa K. Seikagaku. 1996; 68: 775Google Scholar). In chloroplast F0F1, the activity is controlled both by the electrochemical potential of protons which activates the enzyme and by the redox state in the chloroplast which controls the activity of the enzyme through the formation and the cleavage of a disulfide bond on the γ subunit (reviewed in Ref. 27Ort D.R. Oxborough K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 269-291Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). InEscherichia coli F0F1, ε subunit is a unique endogenous inhibitor of the ATPase activity (22Laget P.P. Smith J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 197: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the function is more obvious in the partial complex, F1(23Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that the ε subunit of thermophilic F1(TF1)1modulates the activity of TF1 (28Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and further the holoenzyme, TF0F1 (29Kato-Yamada Y. Bald D. Koike M. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33991-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). From these results, we concluded that F0F1 has two different states that are mutually convertible by a function and/or a certain conformational change of the ε subunit. This finding led us to propose the possible role of the ε subunit in a regulatory system of F0F1. However, there is no direct evidence for the movement or the conformational change in the ε subunit in the complex accompanying this conversion, and the molecular mechanism of the inhibition by the ε subunit is still unclear. The structure of the isolated ε subunit of E. coliF1-ATPase has been solved both by NMR and by x-ray crystallography (30Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28351-28355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have suggested from the biochemical studies that the structure of the ε subunit in F0F1 is essentially the same as that of the isolated ε subunit. In the recently reported partial structure of F0F1 from yeast mitochondria (34Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), the δ subunit (equivalent to the ε subunit of bacterial F0F1) lies on the top of the 10 c subunit ring which is far from the bottom part of the α3β3 ring including the DELSEED region of the β subunit. Although the resolution of this structure is limited to 3.9 Å, the electron density from the δ subunit fits well with the reported structure of the isolated ε subunit from E. coliF1-ATPase (30Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M.

On the contrary, the interaction between DELSEED region of β subunit and C-terminal domain of ε subunit has been suggested from cross-linking studies (21Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Taken together, a rearrangement of the ε subunit in the complex and/or drastic conformational changes in F0F1or ε subunit itself is supposed to occur during the conversion from the suppressed state to the activated state. Actually, the change in the position of the ε subunit in the complex and the conformational change in this subunit itself during the catalytic turnover are also suggested (21Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Acta. 2000; 1458: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In order to investigate a conformational change in the ε subunit on the occasion of the conversion from the suppressed state to the activated state of the complex, we introduced two cysteines each into the C-terminal helical domain and the faced region in the N-terminal β-barrel domain of the ε subunit of TF1. Similar mutant ε subunits of E. coli F1 were already constructed by Schulenberg and Capaldi (33Schulenberg B. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28351-28355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). By using these mutants, they have concluded that the structure of the ε subunit in the intact F0F1 should resemble that determined for the isolated ε subunit. They also discussed that the relative movement of the domains in the ε subunit is not required for the functioning of F0F1, although they have pointed out the modulation of the activity of F0F1 by the ε subunit. Our results indicate that the ε subunit should be in different conformation from the reported structure (30Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M.

The latter must be similar to that of the isolated ε subunit. Furthermore, we concluded that the ATP binding to the catalytic site(s) is a trigger for the transition from the suppressed state to the activated state.

Although 5-foU has been reported to be removed from DNA by Escherichia coli AlkA protein in vitro, its repair mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we used the borohydride trapping assay to detect and characterize repair activities for 5-foU in E. coli extracts with site-specifically designed oligonucleotides containing a 5-foU at defined sites. The trapping assay revealed that there are three kinds of proteins that form covalent complexes with the 5-foU-containing oligonucleotides. Extracts from strains defective in thenth, nei, or mutM gene lacked one of the proteins. All of the trapped complexes were completely lost in extracts from the nth nei mutM triple mutant. The introduction of a plasmid carrying the nth,nei, or mutM gene into the E. colitriple mutant restored the formation of the corresponding protein-DNA complex. Purified Nth, Nei, and MutM proteins were trapped by the 5-foU-containing oligonucleotide to form the complex in the presence of NaBH4. Furthermore, the purified Nth, Nei, and MutM proteins efficiently cleaved the oligonucleotide at the 5-foU site. In addition, 5-foU was site-specifically incorporated into plasmid pSVK3, and the resulting plasmid was replicated in E. coli. The mutation frequency of the plasmid was significantly increased in theE. coli nth nei mutM alkA mutant, compared with the wild-type and alkA strains. From these results it is concluded that the Nth, Nei, and MutM proteins are involved in the repair pathways for 5-foU that serve to avoid mutations in E. coli. 5-Formyluracil (5-foU) is a potentially mutagenic lesion of thymine produced in DNA by ionizing radiation and various chemical oxidants.

These observations led us to examine whether E. coli has another DNA glycosylase(s) that recognize and remove 5-foU from DNA.

The stable DNA-protein complex is called a “trapped complex.” Detection of the trapped complex is useful for identifying DNA glycosylases accompanying AP lyase activity. In this study, we used the NaBH4 trapping assay to detect and characterize repair activities for 5-foU in E. coli extracts with site-specifically designed oligonucleotides containing a 5-foU at defined sites (28Zhang Q.-M.

Overnight cultures of E. coli (50 ml) were centrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and stored at −80 °C. The cells were sonicated in an ice water bath and then centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 min and subsequently at 15,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C. pACYCnth (43Saito Y. Uraki F. Nakajima S. Asaeda A. Ono K. Kubo K. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3783-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR to amplify the nth gene. One primer (Pmet-1) contained aBamHI site followed by the sequence around the putative start codon (5′-TAGGGATCCCGTCTGATGAATAAAGCAA-3′), and the other (Pter-1) contained an EcoRI site followed by the sequence around the stop codon (5′-CCCGCGAATTCACCATGTCAAC-3′). PCR was performed in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm of each dNTP, 0.5 μm of the primer, and 5 units of TaqDNA polymerase. The amplified fragment was digested withBamHI and EcoRI, and then theBamHI/EcoRI fragment containing the whole coding region of the nth gene was subcloned intoBamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-4T-1. The resulting plasmid was designated pGEX-Nth. The DNA sequence encoding the whole open reading frame of themutM gene was amplified by PCR from λ2A6 DNA (44Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) using the following primers: Pmet-2 (5′-TAATGAATTCGGAGATGCTATGCCTGAA-3′) and Pter-2 (5′-TAATTAAGC TTAGCGTAGCGTTTATGCC-3′). PCR was performed as described above. The PCR product was subcloned into the plasmid pKK223-3 at theEcoRI/HindIII site. The recombinant plasmid was designated pKK-MutM. pACYCnei (43Saito Y. Uraki F. Nakajima S. Asaeda A. Ono K. Kubo K. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3783-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR to amplify the whole open reading frame of the nei gene. Two PCR primers were used: Pmet-3 (5′-ATGG AATTCACCATGCCTGAAGGC-3′) and Pter-3 (5′-TAATAAGCTTGCTGACAGG GCCTG-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into the pKK223-3 at HindIII/EcoRI sites. The resulting plasmid was designated pKK-Nei. The sequences were checked to verify that no mutations had been introduced by the PCR. E. coli BL21 carrying pGEX-Nth was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.4. After the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), the culture was incubated at 37 °C for 6.5 h. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and then sonicated on ice. After centrifugation of the cell lysate at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. After washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.6), the GST-Nth fusion protein was eluted with 15 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.6) and dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 6.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl). The GST-Nth fusion protein was then cleaved by thrombin by incubation for 20 h at 4 °C, and the Nth protein was purified using a spin column to remove the GST tag. The purified Nth protein was stored at −80 °C. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel eletrophoresis (PAGE). The concentration of protein was determined using a BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. E. coli KSR7 (nth nei mutM) carrying pKK-MutM was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.3. After IPTG was added at a final concentration of 0.2 mm, the culture was incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C, unless otherwise stated. The cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm PMSF) supplemented with 1 mg/ml of lysozyme. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then disrupted by sonication on ice after freezing and thawing (5 cycles). The lysate was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 60 min and subsequently at 21,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After fractional precipitation of the supernatant with 65% saturation of ammonium sulfate, the precipitate was dissolved and dialyzed in buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 13 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5% glycerol) containing 150 mm NaCl. The dialysate was clarified by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 30 min and loaded on a HiTrap Q Anion Exchange column. The active fractions eluted with 150–200 mm NaCl were pooled, concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (75% saturation), and dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 6.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5% glycerol) containing 100 mm NaCl. The dialysate was applied to a HiTrap SP Cation Exchange column, which had been equilibrated with buffer D. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (100–1000 mm). The active fractions eluted between 550–650 mm NaCl were pooled and concentrated. After dialysis against buffer D containing 100 mm NaCl, the fraction was loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin column. The active fractions eluted between 600 and 700 mm NaCl were concentrated and dialyzed against buffer D containing 300 mm NaCl. The dialysate was applied to a HiLoad Superdex 75 Gel Filtration column. The active fractions eluted with buffer D containing 300 mmNaCl were subsequently applied to a Mono S column. The active fractions eluted between 800 and 900 mm NaCl were pooled and stored at −80 °C. Crude extracts were prepared from E. coli KSR7/pKK-Nei as described above. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. After fractional precipitation of the supernatant with 20–65% saturation of ammonium sulfate, the precipitate was dissolved and dialyzed against buffer D containing 200 mm NaCl. The dialysate was applied to a HiTrap Q column equilibrated with buffer D containing 200 mm NaCl. The flow-through fractions were concentrated using Amicon filtration and dialyzed against buffer D containing 100 mm NaCl. The dialysate was applied to a HiTrap SP column equilibrated with buffer D containing 100 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (100–1000 mm). The active fractions eluted between 400 and 550 mm NaCl were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D containing 100 mmNaCl. The dialysate was applied to a HiTrap Heparin column and eluted with a linear gradient of 100–1000 mm NaCl. The active fractions eluted between 600 and 800 mm NaCl were dialyzed against buffer D containing 200 mm NaCl and applied to a HiLoad Superdex 75 column. The active fractions were then applied to a Mono S column. The active fractions were eluted between 400 and 600 mm NaCl. Purified Nei protein was stored at −80 °C Oligonucleotides containing a 5-foU at defined sites were synthesized as described previously (41Sugiyama H. Matsuda S Zhang Q.-M. Yonei S. Saito I. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 9067-9070Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brief, oligonucleotides (17- and 22-mer) containing 5-(1,2-dihydroxyethyl)uracil were synthesized by the phosphoramidite chemistry using an ABI 381A DNA synthesizer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Saturated NaIO4 was added to a solution of the oligonucleotide containing the precursor of 5-foU, and the reaction mixture was vortex-mixed for 1 min at room temperature to convert 5-(1,2-dihydroxyethyl)uracil to 5-foU (41Sugiyama H. Matsuda S Zhang Q.-M. Yonei S. Saito I. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 9067-9070Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides containing 5-foU were verified by HPLC and HPLC/mass spectrometry analyses. The nucleotide sequences are shown in Fig.1. DNA trapping assays were performed at 37 °C for 30 min in a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 10∼40 fmol of32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotides (Oligo 1/Oligo 4, Oligo 3/Oligo 4, Oligo 5/Oligo 7, or Oligo 6/Oligo 7) with crude extracts or purified Nth, Nei, or MutM protein in 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% glycerol, 0.5 mg of bovine serum albumin in the presence of 100 mm NaBH4. The aqueous solution of NaBH4 (1 m) was prepared just before use. The reaction was terminated by heating at 95 °C for 5 min after the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer. Trapped complexes were analyzed by 10, 12, or 15% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and autoradiographed using Fuji RX film at −80 °C. DNA nicking assays were carried out at 37 °C in a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 20 fmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (Oligo 1/Oligo 4 or Oligo 3/Oligo 4) and purified Nth, Nei, or MutM protein in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl. The reaction was terminated by the addition of stop solution (95% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 20 mm EDTA). After heating at 95 °C for 5 min, the samples were cooled and then loaded onto 20% polyacrylamide gels in 90 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3) containing 7m urea and 2 mm EDTA. After electrophoresis at 1,300 V, the gels were dried and autoradiographed using Fuji RX film at −80 °C. Oligo 2 and Oligo 3 were phosphorylated at the 5′-end by T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 30 min and annealed with the phosphorylated Oligo 8 strand. Vector plasmid pSVK3 was digested with KpnI and SalI, and the large fragment was isolated by electroelution and dissolved in distilled water. The double-stranded oligonucleotide containing 5-foU/A or T/A (1.75 pmol) was ligated to the large fragment (0.35 pmol) by T4 DNA ligase in 66 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 6.6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 200 μm ATP at 16 °C for 24 h. The constructed plasmid DNA was introduced into E. coliAB1157, MS23 (alkA), and KSR8 (nth nei mutM alkA) by the calcium chloride method (45S"

During development, tissue remodeling, and tumorigenesis, matrix components are modified by enzymatic digestion with subsequent effects on integrin binding and signaling. We are interested in understanding the mechanisms by which broad spectrum proteinases such as plasmin are targeted to their extracellular matrix protein substrates. We have utilized plasmin-mediated cleavage of the epithelial basement membrane glycoprotein laminin-5 as a model to evaluate molecular events that direct plasmin activity to specific structural domains. We report that plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) exhibit high affinity, specific binding to the G1 subdomain of the N terminus of the laminin-5 α3 subunit, with equilibrium dissociation constants of 50 nm for plasminogen and 80 nm for tPA. No high affinity binding to the G2, G3, and G4 subdomains was observed. As a result of binding to the G1 subdomain, the catalytic efficiency of tPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation is enhanced 32-fold, leading to increased matrix-associated plasmin that is positioned favorably for cleavage within the G4 subdomain as we have reported previously (Goldfinger, L. E., Stack, M. S., and Jones, J. C. R. (1998) J. Cell Biol. 141, 255–265). Thus, physical constraints dictated by interaction of proteinase and matrix macromolecule control not only enzymatic activity but may regulate substrate targeting of proteinases.

We have utilized plasmin-mediated cleavage of the epithelial basement membrane glycoprotein laminin-5 as a model to evaluate molecular events that direct plasmin activity to specific structural domains. Laminin-5 secreted by epithelial cells is a heterotrimeric protein with an α3β3γ2 subunit composition and promotes epithelial cell migration (11Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 12Zhang K. Kramer R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 309-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, we have previously demonstrated that proteolytic processing of the 190-kDa α3 subunit within the C-terminal globular (G) domain renders laminin-5 competent to induce formation of hemidesmosomes, cell matrix anchorage structures formed in part via binding of laminin-5 to the α6β4 integrin (Fig.1) (13Baker S.E.

In cultured cells, this functional and structural modification of the laminin-5 α3 subunit occurs as a result of limited plasmin proteolysis within the G4 subdomain and requires tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-catalyzed plasminogen (Pg) activation (Fig. 1) (14Goldfinger L.E.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2509-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of the α3 subunit forms a compact globular domain, called the G domain, which is divided into subdomains G1–G5 (16Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VanDevanter D.R. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22779-22787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putative plasmin cleavage site in the G4 subdomain, identified by Goldfingeret al. (14Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S.

Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Further, previous studies with the laminin-1 isoform demonstrated that Pg and tPA binding is localized to the G domain at the C terminus of the laminin α1 subunit (15Moser T.L. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18917-18923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because these data suggest that the G domain of laminin isoforms may function in proteinase targeting, we have evaluated the interaction of Pg and tPA with the G domain of the α3 subunit of laminin-5. Our results demonstrate high affinity binding of both Pg and tPA to the G1 subdomain of the laminin-5 α3 subunit. As a functional consequence of G1 binding, the catalytic efficiency of Pg activation is enhanced, resulting in increased plasmin activity. These data suggest that binding of Pg and tPA to the α3 G1subdomain may function in part to focus cleavage site specificity by positioning Pg and tPA in close proximity to the processing site within the G4 subdomain (14Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).

DNA was transfected into BL21(DE3) or LMG bacteria, and cells containing vector with insert were selected with ampicillin antibiotic. Expression of recombinant protein was induced with either isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside or arabinose. To confirm expression of the appropriate sized recombinant protein, cells were suspended in gel sample buffer. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blotting by standard procedures (see below). Recombinant proteins were identified using a His-HRP probe (Pierce, Rockford, IL). To prepare protein from the bacteria, cells were extracted in a buffer containing 40 mm imidazole, 4m NaCl, and 160 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. The His-tagged proteins were then purified from the cell extracts over a Ni2+-Sepharose column according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Novagen). Protein concentrations were determined by standard Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Purified laminin-5 and recombinant G domain and subdomain proteins were solubilized in 8 m urea, 1% SDS sample buffer in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, with 15% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were processed for SDS-PAGE on 6–12% acrylamide gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). For silver staining, gels were fixed in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid followed by secondary fix in a solution of 10% ethanol, 5% acetic acid. Proteins were oxidized and silver stained using reagents from Bio-Rad, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In addition, separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting by standard procedures (19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 92-121Google Scholar). For ligand blotting, protein was spotted onto nitrocellulose, and the spot was then allowed to dry. The nitrocellulose was treated with a blocking buffer (0.1% Tween, 0.9% NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% fish gelatin, 0.2% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) for 2 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated Pg diluted in the same buffer. After extensive washing the nitrocellulose was incubated in a streptavidin-HRP conjugate, bound proteins were detected with ECL chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), and images were captured on X-Omat Imaging Film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Protein-protein interactions and equilibrium binding constants were studied by surface plasmon resonance using an IAsys evanescent wave biosensor (Affinity Sensor, Paramus, NJ). We used either biotin-coated cuvettes or aminosaline cuvettes, provided by the manufacturer. Streptavidin (100 μg/ml; Sigma) in PBS-0.05%Tween (PBST) was added to the biotin-coated cuvette, and subsequently, either biotinylated Pg (20 μg/ml) or biotinylated tPA (200 μg/ml) in PBST was immobilized on the cuvette surface by incubation for approximately 20 min at room temperature. In the case of aminosaline cuvettes, the cuvette was first washed with 10 mm HCl for 5 min. After extensive washing with PBS, laminin-5, recombinant G domain, and subdomains were suspended in PBS at a concentration of 200 μg/ml, added to the cuvette, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The cuvettes were washed with PBS to remove unbound protein. In all cases, refraction of the biosensor laser was used as a measure of the affinity of binding of soluble polypeptides incubated at increasing concentrations in the cuvette coated with the immobilized protein under test. All binding experiments were evaluated by nonlinear regression analysis. All curves fit the equation for a rectangular hyperbola with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 or greater. Purified laminin-5, recombinant G domain, and G subdomain proteins were coated at 5 μg/ml in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4 buffer onto the surfaces of wells of a 96-well plate (Sarsdedt, Arlington Heights, IL) at 4 °C for 14 h. Wells were blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed with 20 mm HEPES. The effect of laminin-5 and recombinant fragments of laminin-5 on the rate of Pg activation was determined by a coupled reaction in which the amidolytic activity of generated plasmin was monitored colorimetrically. Pg (0–0.3 μm) was incubated in coated wells for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of 0.3 mm of the plasmin substrate VLK-pNA at 37 °C in a total volume of 175 μl. Activation of Pg was initiated by the addition of 0.55 nm tPA (20 IU/ml). Hydrolysis of VLK-pNA by the resulting plasmin was recorded as a change in absorbance at 405 nm over time using a Molecular Devices Thermomax microtiter plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA). Kinetic constants were extrapolated from the data by nonlinear regression analysis using Sigmaplot (SPSS Inc., Richmond, CA). Pg and tPA are co-localized with laminin-5 in the extracellular matrix of many epithelial cells, and the presence of both zymogen and activator are necessary for limited plasmin proteolysis of laminin-5 and subsequent hemidesmosome assembly (14Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Moreover, both purified Pg and tPA have been shown to interact with laminin-5 in a ligand blot assay (14Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Because plasmin is a broad spectrum proteinase, these results imply that targeting of cleavage to a distinct domain of the laminin-5 substrate may be regulated by specific protein-protein interactions that position plasmin in close proximity to its cleavage site. To test this hypothesis, the affinity of Pg and tPA binding to laminin-5 was quantified by surface plasmon resonance in an evanescent wave biosensor. Purified laminin-5 was added stepwise in increasing concentrations (0–150 nm) to immobilized Pg or tPA, and the degree of refraction of a light beam crossing the surface of the immobilized protein was used to measure the affinity of protein-protein interaction (20Jönsson U. Malmqvist M. Adv. Biosensors. 1992; 2: 291-336Google Scholar, 21Gase K. Gase A. Schirmer H. Malke H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Laminin-5 binds to immobilized Pg and tPA in a concentration-dependent, saturable fashion with dissociation constants (K d) of 40 and 35 nm, respectively (Fig. 2,A and B). In control experiments, laminin-5 shows no obvious specific binding to biotinylated control proteins, including biotinylated BSA (Fig. 2 C) and biotinylated lactoperoxidase (not shown). To confirm the bindings are at equilibrium, in control experiments, Pg and tPA were coated at approximately half-saturation, and binding of laminin-5 was evaluated as described above. Although the plateau of laminin-5 binding was reduced, the overallK d for binding was unchanged (not shown). Additional controls demonstrated that the binding of laminin-5 with Pg was rapid and reversible (Fig. 3). To mimic more accurately binding interactions likely to occur in the environmentin vivo, laminin-5 was passively absorbed onto aminosaline cuvettes and tPA or Pg binding was evaluated as described above. These data confirmed concentration-dependent, saturable binding between Pg or tPA and laminin-5 with dissociation constants (K d) of 25 and 40 nm, respectively (Fig.2, D and E). Soluble uPA failed to bind immobilized laminin-5, confirming the specificity of tPA and Pg binding to laminin-5 (Fig. 2 F).Figure 3Kinetics and reversibility of laminin-5 and Pg interaction. Binding of laminin-5 to immobilized Pg was initiated by the addition of 400 nm laminin-5 into the cuvettes, and the binding was monitored using surface plasmon resonance. Dissociation was induced by replacing laminin-5 solution with blank buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether Pg and tPA binding sites are localized proximal to the plasmin cleavage site in the G domain of the α3 subunit of the laminin-5 molecule (Fig. 1), binding to recombinant G domain and subdomain polypeptides was also evaluated. Sequences corresponding to the entire laminin-5 G domain or the individual G1, G2, G3, and G4 subdomains were generated from MCF-10A cell mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and then cloned into bacteria expression vectors. The latter were transfected into bacterial cells and recombinant proteins with a C-terminal His6 tag were purified from cell lysates over a Ni2+-Sepharose column. Protein recovery was typically approximately 1 mg of purified protein/liter of induced bacterial culture. Purity of recombinant proteins was confirmed by silver staining following separation by SDS-PAGE (Fig.4). These same polypeptides are recognized by a His-HRP probe (results not shown). Surface plasmon resonance binding experiments were then performed with the recombinant α3 subdomain polypeptides. Similar to intact laminin-5, both Pg and tPA bound to immobilized α3 laminin G domain in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner (K d = 12 and 10 nm, respectively; Fig.5). In the reverse experiment, recombinant G domain bound to immobilized Pg or tPA with similar affinities (K d = 2 and 4 nm, respectively) (not shown). Similar K d values were obtained when Pg or tPA were immobilized at half-saturation concentration (not shown).Figure 5Pg and tPA bind to the G domain of the α3 subunit of laminin-5. Pg or tPA (0–50 nm) was added to immobilized recombinant α3 G domain protein and binding evaluated by surface plasmon resonance as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because these results demonstrated high affinity of Pg and tPA binding to the α3 G domain, interaction specificity was further delineated using recombinant G1, G2, G3, and G4 subdomain polypeptides. Pg and tPA bind to immobilized G1 with a K d of 50 and 80 nm, respectively (Fig.6, A and B). Conversely, when tPA and Pg are immobilized at saturated or half-saturated level, the respective K d (25 and 40 nm for Pg and tPA, respectively) for the binding of purified G1 to these proteins are comparable (not shown). Pg and tPA showed little binding to immobilized G4 (Fig. 6,C and D). In additional experiments, no binding of Pg or tPA to purified recombinant G2 or G3subdomain proteins was observed (not shown). Pg has been shown to bind to matrix molecules via interaction with lysine residues (22Stack M.S. Madison E.L. Pizzo S.V. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 479-494Google Scholar). To determine whether Pg interacts with the G1 subdomain in a lysine-dependent manner, G1 subdomain protein and, as a control, G4subdomain protein were spotted onto nitrocellulose at 1 μg/ml and incubated with purified biotinylated Pg at 10 μg/ml. Pg bound G1 but not G4 protein, consistent with results presented above. The lysine analog, EACA, inhibited Pg binding to the G1 protein (Fig.7 A). These results were confirmed using surface plasmon resonance, where binding interactions between laminin-5, G domain, or G1 subdomain with Pg were effectively blocked by EACA (Fig. 7 B). Specific localization of Pg and tPA to the G1 subdomain of laminin-5 may direct subsequent proteolysis within the G4 subdomain (14Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition to substrate targeting, proteinase binding to immobilized matrix may also influence zymogen activation kinetics (23Stack M.S. Gonzales-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 30: 2073-2077Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that both Pg and tPA bind to the same α3 G subdomain. To evaluate the effect of laminin-5 binding on Pg activation kinetics, tPA catalyzed Pg activation was evaluated in the presence of immobilized G domain or subdomain polypeptides. Michaelis-Menten curves for the activation reactions are shown in Fig. 8, and kinetic constants are summarized in Table I. Whereas activation on G2, G3, or G4subdomain coated surfaces was similar to that observed in solution, activation on G1 was significantly enhanced (by a 32 folds increase in Kcat/K m). These data suggest that colocalization of Pg and tPA to laminin-5 containing matrix surfaces via interaction with the α3 G1subdomain may result in increased concentration of plasmin properly positioned laminin-5 processing.Table IKinetic parameters of Pg activation by tPA in the presence of recombinant laminin-5 subdomain fragmentsα3 subdomain fragmentK mK catK cat/K mFold change in K cat/K mμms −1μm⋅s −1G10.0293.93135.532.3G20.0822.1125.76.1G30.2412.048.52.0G40.1342.7220.34.8BSA0.090.384.21Kinetic constants were determined from the initial velocity data shown in Fig. 8 using nonlinear regression analysis.

Laminin G domains contain binding sites for cells and other ECM molecules and thus contribute significantly to laminin function. The G domains of both the α1 and α2 laminin subunits have high affinity binding sites for a variety of extracellular matrix molecules such as perlecan, heparin, and sulfatides, as well as for cell surface receptors including α-dystroglycan (24Yurchenco P.D. Sung U. Ward M.D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8356-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sung U. O'Rear J.J. Yurchenco P.D. Eur. J.

Fibulin-1 and -2 and nidogen-2 also bind to the laminin α2 G domain but with somewhat lower affinity (26Talts J.F. Andac Z. Gohring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In the case of laminin-5, the α3β1integrin binding site has been reported to lie within the G2 subdomain, whereas laminin-5 apparently interacts with heparin and other macromolecules via its G4 and G5 subdomains (27Mizushima H. Takamura H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 979-987PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have demonstrated that both Pg and tPA bind specifically and with high affinity to the G1 subdomain, the first proximal region of the laminin-5 α3 chain G domain. The functional significance of these interactions is apparent, because we have previously shown that plasmin cleavage of laminin-5 has a profound impact on epithelial cell behavior (14Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The G1 subdomain of the laminin α3 subunit shows little homology with the corresponding domains of the α1 and α2 laminin subunits (16Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VanDevanter D.R. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22779-22787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sasaki M. Kleinman H.K. Huber H. Deutzmann R. Yamada Y. J. Biol.

Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18917-18923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, Pg and tPA appear to bind the laminin α1 G4 domain, whereas we detect no such binding to the analogous domain of the α3laminin subunit (15Moser T.L. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18917-18923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G1 subdomain of the laminin α3 subunit shows 58% similarity with that of the laminin α4 chain and 53% similarity to that of the human laminin α5 chain (16Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VanDevanter D.R.

Biochem. 1997; 246: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the α subunit G1 domains of other laminin isoforms may also bind Pg and tPA. Further, the G4 subdomain of the human α3 chain, which contains the plasmin cleavage site we have identified previously, has 53% similarity to that of the human α4 laminin chain, suggesting that the α4chain may also be subject to plasmin proteolytic processing (14Goldfinger L.E.

Our data support the idea that Pg binds the laminin α3subunit G1 subdomain in a lysine-dependent manner. Lysine binding site-dependent association of Pg with fibrin or other matrix molecules induces a dramatic conformational change in Pg, resulting in a 15 Å increase in its Stoke's radius. As a result of this conformational change, the Arg561–Val562 peptide bond is more readily accessible to tPA, thus enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the activation (23Stack M.S. Gonzales-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 30: 2073-2077Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Castellino F.J. Chem. Rev. 1981; 81: 431-436Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 34Mangel W., BH., L. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 1990; 248: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the current study, a significant increase in k cat/Km is observed in following Pg and tPA interaction with either intact G domain or G1 subdomain. Taken together, our data suggest a model for the regulation of plasmin cleavage of laminin-5. High affinity association of Pg and tPA with the G1 subdomain of intact laminin-5 enhances the catalytic efficiency of tPA-catalyzed Pg activation, resulting in generation of plasmin. Because recent data suggest a close association of the G1 and G4subdomains in intact laminin, the newly generated plasmin is thus properly positioned for proteolytic cleavage within the G4subdomain (Fig. 1) (14Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 35Andac Z. Sasaki T. Mann K. Brancaccio A. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is a precedent for this because it has been shown previously that in endothelial cells, Pg and tPA bind the annexin II tetramer, a calcium- and phospholipid-binding protein, with high affinity (36Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Mirza U.A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. J. Biol.

Moreover, the formation of the Pg, tPA, and annexin II complex facilitates tPA-dependent conversion of Pg to plasmin (38Kassam G. Le B.-H. Choi K.-S. Kang H.-M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M.

Unprocessed laminin-5 in the extracellular matrix promotes migration of epithelial cells, whereas plasmin-cleaved laminin-5 blocks cell migration by inducing formation of hemidesmosomes, which anchor the cells to the cleaved laminin-5 substrate (14Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of cells to efficiently generate plasmin and to specifically localize the enzyme to a distinct subdomain of the 460-kDa macromolecular laminin-5 substrate may represent key regulatory steps that control the divergent cell processes of migration and adhesion (14Goldfinger L.E.

Initially, Gln2 in the N-terminal domain of α2AP becomes cross-linked to each fibrin α-chain by plasma transglutaminase, which is also termed FXIIIa. Then, the C-terminal domain of α2AP interacts with the kringle structures of plasmin so that the reactive-site Arg364 in the third domain aligns and forms a covalent bond with the active-site Ser in plasmin to give an inactive protease-inhibitor complex.

FXIII is a heterotetramer proenzyme composed of paired A and B chains and is activated to FXIIIa by thrombin plus Ca2+. Tissue transglutaminase (tTG), a single-chain enzyme that is widely distributed in cells and tissues, does not require activation by proteolysis. The substrate specificity of FXIIIa for β-casein, fibrin/fibrinogen, or their peptide derivatives differs from that of tTG (7Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 419-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2712-2715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shainoff J.R. Urbanic D.A. DiBello P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6429-6437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the plasma proteins that have Gln substrate site(s) for FXIIIa, α2AP is recognized as having the highest kinetic efficiency (k cat/K m(app)), with its substrate site being the second Gln from the N terminus (10Carmassi F. Chung S.I. Prog. Fibrinolysis. 1983; 6: 281-285Google Scholar,11Tamaki T. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14767-14772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the kinetic efficiency of tTG for α2AP and the identity of the substrate site(s) involved have not been established. tTG is believed to catalyze the cross-linking of α2AP to fibrinogen in vitro (12Greenberg C.S. Achyuthan K.E. Borowitz M.J. Shuman M.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 702-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the cross-link formation in fibrin-fibrinogen complexes in human atherosclerotic plaques (13Valenzuela R. Shainoff J.R. DiBello P.M. Urbanic D.A. Anderson J.M. Matsueda G.R. Kudryk B.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 861-880PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, α2AP has been found in fibrin-rich matrix and granulation tissue of human skin wounds (14Schaefer B.M. Maier K. Eickhoff U. Bechtel M. Kramer M.D. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1996; 288: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and tTG has been suggested to promote wound healing (15Haroon Z.A. Hettasch J.M. Lai T.S. Dewhirst M.W. Greenberg C.S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1787-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Given these observations, we compared the Gln cross-linking sites in α2AP for the tTG isolated from guinea pig liverversus FXIIIa using both wild-type α2AP (WT-α2AP) and mutant α2AP in which Gln2 was replaced with Ala (Q2A-α2AP). Although a previous report suggested that only the Gln2site in α2AP participates in cross-link formation catalyzed by FXIIIa (11Tamaki T. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14767-14772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mass spectrometric analysis of 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (BPA)-labeled WT-α2AP (16Lee K.N. Maxwell M.D. Patterson Jr., M.K. Birckbichler P.J. Conway E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed four such Gln substrate sites for FXIIIa. We report here the expression and purification of WT-α2AP and Q2A-α2AP, the identification and reactivity of their respective Gln substrate sites, and the rates of FXIIIa- and tTG-mediated cross-linking for each α2AP species. Native plasma α2AP was either purified from citrated plasma as described previously (17Lee S.C. Lee K.N. Schwartzott D.G. Jackson K.W. Tae W.-C. McKee P.A. Prep. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1997; 27: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or purchased from Calbiochem. Human FXIII was prepared from human plasma using a published procedure (18Folk J.E. Chung S.I. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 358-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Guinea pig liver transglutaminase was purchased from Sigma and further purified (19Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson Jr., M.K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 162: 1370-1375Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 0.670 (20Wiman B. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), 1.38 (21Schwartz M.L. Pizzo S.V. Hill R.L. McKee P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1395-1407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 1.58 (22Folk J.E. Cole P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5518-5525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for a 1 mg/ml solution of α2AP, FXIII, and guinea pig liver transglutaminase, respectively. Molecular masses of 320 kDa (heterotetramer) and 80 kDa (monomer) were used to determine the concentrations for zymogen FXIII and guinea pig liver transglutaminase, respectively. Both FXIIIa and guinea pig liver transglutaminase showed ∼95% of the reported specific activities (18Folk J.E. Chung S.I. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 358-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 19Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson Jr., M.K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 162: 1370-1375Google Scholar) when assayed by [14C]putrescine uptake by casein. Human thrombin was supplied by Dr. D. L. Aronson (Division of Biological Standards, National Institutes of Health). [14C]Methylamine (51.8 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and human fibrinogen was from Kabi (Stockholm, Sweden). Other reagents were obtained from the following suppliers: Escherichia coli expression vector pLEX andE. coli strain GI724, Invitrogen (San Diego, CA); plasmin and the chromogenic plasmin substrate S-2251 (VLK-p-nitroanilide), Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden); l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, Sigma; and BPA, Pierce. Human α2AP cDNA withNdeI and NotI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was amplified as described previously (23Rashtchian A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using two oligonucleotide primers (5′-CUACUACUACUACATATGAACCAGGAGCAGGTGTCCCCAC for the NdeI site and 5′-CAUCAUCAUCAUGCGGCCGCTCACTTGGGGCTGCCAAAC for the NotI site) and the template α2AP cDNA (5Lee K.N. Tae W.-C. Jackson K.W. Kwon S.H. McKee P.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 164-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified DNA was subcloned into the plasmid pAMP1 using uracil-DNA glycosylase. α2AP cDNA was excised from pAMP1 with NdeI and NotI and cloned into the E. coli pLEX expression vector containing the tryptophan-inducibleP L promoter from bacteriophage λ (24Mieschendahl M. Petri T. Hänggi U. Bio/Technology. 1986; 4: 802-808Google Scholar). The resulting clone as a WT-α2AP expression vector was termed pLEX/AP. The Q2A-α2AP expression vector, pLEX/APQ2A, was prepared using the polymerase chain reaction and a synthetic primer (5′-CUACUACUACUACATATGAACGCGGAGCAGGTGTCCCCAC for the NdeI site). The construct was authenticated by double-strand DNA sequencing using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Model ABI-373A Sequencer and a fluorescent dye-labeled dideoxy terminator kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After sequence verification, the pLEX/AP and pLEX/APQ2A vectors were transformed into E. colistrain GI724. E. coli GI724 cells containing the pLEX/AP or pLEX/APQ2A expression vector were grown overnight at 30 °C in RM medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Ten ml of the overnight culture were added to 6 × 500 ml of induction medium (Invitrogen) in 2-liter baffled flasks. When each culture reached A 550 = 0.5–0.8, tryptophan was added to 100 μg/ml final concentration. After a further 3-h growth at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation; and α2AP, expressed as an inclusion body, was solubilized, refolded, and purified using a published procedure (25Lin X.L. Wong R.N. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4482-4489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following slight modifications: (a) instead of 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm DTT was used as a reducing agent during solubilization and denaturation; and (b) in the final purification step, a PerSeptive Biosystems workstation (BioCad 700 E) with an anion-exchange HQ/H column was used instead of an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech instrument and a Mono Q column. In brief, after refolding by rapid dilution, active α2AP-containing fractions from Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column (2.5 × 100 cm) chromatography were pooled and applied at 10 ml/min to an HQ/H column (10 × 100 mm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/Bistris (pH 7.5). Subsequent to complete washing of non-bound components, a 50-ml salt gradient was developed (0–0.3m NaCl) at 20 ml/min while collecting 2.5-ml fractions. Fractions with plasmin inhibitory activity were pooled, concentrated using a Centricon-30 (Amicon, Inc.), and stored at −80 °C. The plasmin inhibitory activity of recombinant α2AP was analyzed by a published method (5Lee K.N. Tae W.-C. Jackson K.W. Kwon S.H. McKee P.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 164-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters of FXIIIa and tTG for native and recombinant α2AP proteins were determined using a modification of a published [14C]methylamine incorporation assay (26Lee K.N. Fesus L. Yancey S.T. Girard J.E. Chung S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14689-14694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, assays were carried out at 37 °C in Tris-buffered saline (40 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5)) containing selected amounts of native or recombinant α2AP, 2 mm [14C]methylamine, 31 nm FXIII or tTG, 0.1 unit/ml thrombin (not included in the tTG reaction), and 5 mm CaCl2. Measurement of [14C]methylamine incorporation into α2AP and analysis of kinetic data were performed as previously reported (5Lee K.N. Tae W.-C. Jackson K.W. Kwon S.H. McKee P.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 164-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transglutaminase-catalyzed BPA incorporation into α2AP was assessed by modification of a published method (16Lee K.N. Maxwell M.D. Patterson Jr., M.K. Birckbichler P.J. Conway E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson Jr., M.K. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 μm α2AP was incubated at 37 °C for selected times in Tris-buffered saline with 130 nm tTG or FXIIIa, 10 mm BPA, 1 unit/ml thrombin (not included in the tTG assay), and 5 mmCaCl2. Each reaction was terminated by adding 10 mm EDTA. As a control, EDTA replaced CaCl2; and as a second control, tTG and FXIII were omitted. BPA-labeled α2AP was detected by reaction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin after SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (16Lee K.N. Maxwell M.D. Patterson Jr., M.K. Birckbichler P.J. Conway E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). BPA-labeled α2AP (1 mg) was dissolved in 300 μl of 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.2m Tris, and 1.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.5). The protein was reduced by incubation at 37 °C for 60 min after the addition of 150 μl of 45 mm DTT. Alkylation was initiated by adding 300 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide, and the mixture was then incubated under argon for 1 h at 37 °C. The reduced and alkylated sample was then immediately desalted by injection onto a 1 × 50-mm PLRP-S reversed-phase HPLC column (Polymer Labs, Inc.) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 2% acetonitrile/water. The alkylation reagents passed directly through the column, whereas the protein was eluted at 18 min with a linear gradient to 68% acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After removal of HPLC solvents by vacuum centrifugation, the protein was digested with trypsin (1:50, w/w) in 0.1 mNH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) at 37 °C for 15 h. Approximately 90% of each tryptic digest was applied to an avidin affinity column (Pierce), which captured BPA-labeled peptides while allowing unlabeled peptides to pass through. BPA-labeled peptides were eluted according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer and then fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC as previously reported (5Lee K.N. Tae W.-C. Jackson K.W. Kwon S.H. McKee P.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 164-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify BPA-labeled Gln residues in α2AP, each peak was manually collected and applied to a Polybrene-treated glass-fiber filter for microsequencing using a Procise Model 492 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). For LC/MS analysis of the remaining 10% of each digest, a Model UMA-600 HPLC system (Michrom BioResources, Inc., Auburn, CA) equipped with a Magic C18 column (1.0 × 150 mm, 20-nm pores) was utilized. The column was equilibrated with 2% acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Upon sample injection, the solvent composition was increased to 13.5% acetonitrile, and then a linear gradient was performed to 45% acetonitrile over 60 min. Peptides were detected at a 215-nm wavelength. The HPLC system was connected to an electrospray mass spectrometer (Sciex Model API III, Applied Biosystems) equipped with an articulated ion spray source operated in the positive ion mode. It was scanned over anm/z range of 400–2000, with a step size of 0.4 Da and a dwell time of 1.5 ms/step. Labeled and unlabeled peptides were located by reconstructed ion current analysis of data for each peptide over a 2.0-atomic mass unit window for both the singly and doubly charged forms of each peptide based upon the peptide's predicted monoisotopic molecular mass. Labeling efficiencies of peptides were expressed as percent modification determined by division of the labeled peptide area by the combined area of unlabeled and labeled forms of each peptide. Cross-linking reactions were carried out at 37 °C for selected times in Tris-buffered saline containing 6 μm fibrinogen, 1 μm α2AP, 50 nm FXIII or tTG, 5 units/ml thrombin(not included in the tTG reaction), and 10 mm CaCl2. Each reaction was terminated by adding 9 m urea, 3% SDS, and 10 mg/ml DTT and solubilized by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C before electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was performed on a Novex precast 10–20% acrylamide gradient gel using a Novex Xcell apparatus. Gels were stained for protein with GELCODE Blue stain (Pierce). For Western immunoblotting, proteins from unstained gels (10–20%; Novex) were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the Novex blot module and detected using a monoclonal antibody to the C-terminal region of α2AP (American Diagnostica) and horseradish peroxidase labeling. In a yeast expression system, recombinant α2AP is expressed at low levels with its N terminus blocked (5Lee K.N. Tae W.-C. Jackson K.W. Kwon S.H. McKee P.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 164-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to circumvent this problem, an E. coli expression vector containing a P Lpromoter (24Mieschendahl M. Petri T. Hänggi U. Bio/Technology. 1986; 4: 802-808Google Scholar) and α2AP cDNA was constructed. With this construct, α2AP with a free N terminus was expressed as ∼10% of total cellular proteins, with ∼5% as soluble and ∼95% as an insoluble inclusion body. To obtain active soluble α2AP from the insoluble form, inclusion bodies were solubilized, refolded, and purified according to a published method (25Lin X.L. Wong R.N. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4482-4489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except for the following minor modification. In the solubilizing step, 10 mm DTT was added because when 2-mercaptoethanol was used, recombinant α2AP showed three peaks in electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS) spectra. One peak corresponded to the calculated non-glycosylated molecular mass of 50,583 Da, and the other peaks corresponded to the addition of one or two molecules of 2-mercaptoethanol (76–79 Da). Therefore, 2-mercaptoethanol was replaced by DTT to obtain a homogenous purified α2AP preparation. Once solubilized, recombinant α2AP was diluted rapidly to minimize aggregation and to promote refolding; it was then applied to a gel filtration column. In Fig. 1, the size-exclusion chromatogram shows that the first major protein peak did not have plasmin inhibitory activity, but the second minor protein peak contained active α2AP that was ∼25% of the total α2AP as judged by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (data not shown). The three most active fractions withA 405 = 0 (Fig. 1) were pooled and further purified using anion-exchange HQ/H column chromatography (Fig.2). By SDS-PAGE analysis, purified recombinant α2AP showed a single band with a molecular mass of 51 kDa, which is the expected size for non-glycosylated α2AP (Fig. 2, inset). Approximately 5 mg of active purified α2AP were obtained from each liter of culture. Purified recombinant WT-α2AP displayed a single peak of 50,583 Da in ES-MS spectra (Fig.3 A), which corresponded to its calculated molecular mass. The first 12 amino acids of its N-terminal sequence were determined to be MNQEQVSPLTLL, indicating an additional Met residue. Mutant α2AP (Q2A-α2AP), purified using the above procedure, had an N-terminal amino acid sequence of MNAEQVSPLTLL, in which Gln, the third amino acid from the N terminus (equivalent to Gln2 (28Lijnen H.R. Holmes W.E. Van Hoef B. Wiman B. Rodriguez H. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) of native plasma α2AP), was replaced by Ala.Figure 1Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography of recombinant α2AP. Ten ml of solubilized and refolded sample were applied to a 2.5 × 100-cm column and eluted with 20 mm Tris and 0.4 murea (pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 27 ml/h, and 8-ml fractions were collected. Each fraction was monitored at A 280for protein concentration and at A 405 for plasmin inhibitory activity of α2AP. For plasmin inhibitory activity, 5-μl aliquots of each fraction were incubated with plasmin and a chromogenic substrate (S-2251) for 20 min, and then hydrolysis of S-2251 was measured at A 405.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2Anion-exchange chromatography (PerSeptive Biosystems HQ/H column) of active α2AP fractions obtained from Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration.

As shown in Fig.4, all three α2AP proteins inhibited plasmin activity with the same rapidity. These observations are in accord with previous reports that non-glycosylated recombinant α2AP (5Lee K.N. Tae W.-C. Jackson K.W. Kwon S.H. McKee P.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 164-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), α1-antitrypsin (29Kwon K.S. Lee S. Yu M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and α1-chymotrypsin (30Rubin H. Wang Z.M. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have activities essentially the same as their glycosylated native counterparts. Despite our recombinant α2AP having the additional Met residue (at the N terminus compared with the native form), it possessed full plasmin inhibitory activity. Similarly, Q2A-α2AP, prepared by replacing Gln2 with Ala, inhibited plasmin as effectively as native α2AP or WT-α2AP. Hence, non-glycosylation, the extra N-terminal Met, and the Gln2mutation did not affect plasmin inhibition by α2AP. Both native and recombinant α2AP proteins were assessed as transglutaminase substrates by comparing kinetic parameters of transglutaminase-catalyzed [14C]methylamine incorporation into α2AP (26Lee K.N. Fesus L. Yancey S.T. Girard J.E. Chung S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14689-14694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a saturating concentration of methylamine (2 mm) and selected concentrations of native α2AP, WT-α2AP, or Q2A-α2AP. As shown in Table I, tTG gaveK m(app) values of 15.8, 14.9, and 41.2 μm for native α2AP, WT-α2AP, and Q2A-α2AP, respectively. Hence, tTG showed full affinity for WT-α2AP, but a dramatic loss of affinity for Q2A-α2AP. FXIIIa also showed a similar trend of affinities, with K m(app) values of 5.35, 5.02, and 39.5 μm for native α2AP, WT-α2AP, and Q2A-α2AP, respectively. However, the overall kinetic efficiencies (k cat/K m(app)) of native α2AP (716 min−1/mm) and WT-α2AP (780 min−1/mm) for FXIIIa were ∼3-fold higher than those of native α2AP (260 min−1/mm) and WT-α2AP (274 min−1/mm) for tTG, thereby demonstrating that α2AP is a better substrate for FXIIIa.Table IEvaluation of α2AP as a substrate of TG and FXIIIaα2AP substrateEnzymeK m(app)k catk cat/K m(app)μmmin −1min −1 /mmNativetTG15.84.11260NativeFXIIIa5.353.83716Wild-typetTG14.94.08274Wild-typeFXIIIa5.023.92780Q2A mutanttTG41.20.9021.8Q2A mutantFXIIIa39.50.8822.2Assays were performed using substrate concentrations of 2–8 μm for native and wild-type α2AP proteins and 10–50 μm for Q2A-α2AP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Assays were performed using substrate concentrations of 2–8 μm for native and wild-type α2AP proteins and 10–50 μm for Q2A-α2AP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unexpectedly, [14C]methylamine was incorporated by tTG or FXIIIa catalysis into Q2A-α2AP despite its lack of Gln2, which has been suggested as the only FXIIIa substrate site (11Tamaki T. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14767-14772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the kinetic efficiencies (k cat/K m(app)) of Q2A-α2AP were ∼12- and 35-fold lower than those of WT-α2AP for tTG and FXIIIa, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, another amine substrate, BPA (31Jeon W.M. Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Conway E. Patterson Jr., M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), could also be incorporated into both WT-α2AP and Q2A-α2AP by tTG and FXIIIa catalysis. However, Q2A-α2AP was labeled by BPA and either transglutaminase at much lower efficiencies than WT-α2AP, which was consistent with [14C]methylamine data. These results indicate that α2AP has more than one Gln substrate site, but that Gln2 is clearly the primary substrate site for both tTG and FXIIIa. To determine how many molecules of BPA can be incorporated into an α2AP molecule by transglutaminase catalysis, we analyzed ES-MS spectra of BPA-labeled products. BPA labeling was performed with intact protein under nondenaturing conditions to ascertain that sites labeled were those that are physiologically available. Fig. 3 shows representative ES-MS spectra of products from tTG-mediated BPA labeling of WT-α2AP. Fig.3 A represents a 1-h incubation without tTG (control) and shows only one 50,583-Da peak, which corresponds to the calculated mass of unlabeled WT-α2AP. Fig. 3 B shows a 1-h incubation with tTG and shows three peaks in the mass spectrum, one corresponding to the calculated non-glycosylated molecular mass of 50,583 Da and two others corresponding to the addition of one and two BPA molecules (∼310 Da each). Fig. 3 C depicts a 2-h incubation with tTG and shows four peaks, one corresponding to a molecular mass of 50,583 Da and the three others to the addition of one, two, and three BPA molecules. These data indicate that during the 2-h incubation, at least three BPA molecules were incorporated into WT-α2AP by tTG catalysis. WT-α2AP labeled with FXIIIa and BPA for 2 h also showed four peaks with molecular masses comparable to the addition of one, two, and three BPA molecules (data not shown). Q2A-α2AP labeled with tTG or FXIIIa and BPA showed three peaks, one corresponding to the calculated molecular mass of 50,526 Da and the two others to the addition of one and two BPA molecules. Viewed together, these results indicate that WT-α2AP and Q2A-α2AP have at least three and two Gln substrate sites, respectively, for both tTG and FXIIIa. To locate Gln substrate sites, α2AP was labeled with BPA and then reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. As a first step, BPA-labeled tryptic peptides were isolated from the tryptic digest by avidin affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The labeled peptides were further purified by reversed-phase HPLC and then subjected to ES-MS analysis. As shown in Table II, none of the four peptides (T1, T2, T31, and T35) isolated by avidin affinity chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC matched the calculated mass of any predicted tryptic peptide from WT-α2AP.

https://openalex.org/W2127142192,"Cytochrome P450eryF (CYP107A1), which hydroxylates deoxyerythronolide B in erythromycin biosynthesis, lacks the otherwise highly conserved threonine that is thought to promote O–O bond scission. The role of this threonine is satisfied in P450eryF by a substrate hydroxyl group, making deoxyerythronolide B the only acceptable substrate. As shown here, replacement of Ala245 by a threonine enables the oxidation of alternative substrates using either H2O2 or O2/spinach ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase as the source of oxidizing equivalents. Testosterone is oxidized to 1-, 11α-, 12-, and 16α-hydroxytestosterone. A kinetic solvent isotope effect of 2.2 indicates that the A245T mutation facilitates dioxygen bond cleavage. This gain-of-function evidence confirms the role of the conserved threonine in P450 catalysis. Furthermore, a Hill coefficient of 1.3 and dependence of the product distribution on the testosterone concentration suggest that two testosterone molecules bind in the active site, in accord with a published structure of the P450eryF-androstenedione complex. P450eryF is thus a structurally defined model for the catalytic turnover of multiply bound substrates proposed to occur with CYP3A4. In view of its large active site and defined structure, catalytically active P450eryF mutants are also attractive templates for the engineering of novel P450 activities. Cytochrome P450eryF (CYP107A1), which hydroxylates deoxyerythronolide B in erythromycin biosynthesis, lacks the otherwise highly conserved threonine that is thought to promote O–O bond scission. The role of this threonine is satisfied in P450eryF by a substrate hydroxyl group, making deoxyerythronolide B the only acceptable substrate. As shown here, replacement of Ala245 by a threonine enables the oxidation of alternative substrates using either H2O2 or O2/spinach ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase as the source of oxidizing equivalents. Testosterone is oxidized to 1-, 11α-, 12-, and 16α-hydroxytestosterone. A kinetic solvent isotope effect of 2.2 indicates that the A245T mutation facilitates dioxygen bond cleavage. This gain-of-function evidence confirms the role of the conserved threonine in P450 catalysis. Furthermore, a Hill coefficient of 1.3 and dependence of the product distribution on the testosterone concentration suggest that two testosterone molecules bind in the active site, in accord with a published structure of the P450eryF-androstenedione complex. P450eryF is thus a structurally defined model for the catalytic turnover of multiply bound substrates proposed to occur with CYP3A4. In view of its large active site and defined structure, catalytically active P450eryF mutants are also attractive templates for the engineering of novel P450 activities. cytochrome P450 iron protoporphyrin IX independent of the iron ligation and oxidation state 6-deoxyerythronolide B spinach ferredoxin reductase high pressure liquid chromatography thin layer chromatography kinetic solvent isotope effect P450eryF1(CYP107A1) catalyzes the stereospecific 6(S)-hydroxylation of deoxyerythronolide B (6-DEB) in the biosynthesis of erythromycin bySaccharopolyspora erythraea (Fig.1) (1Shafiee A.

Science. 1991; 252: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The genetic manipulation of macrocyclic antibiotic biosynthetic pathways, including that of erythromycin, is currently under investigation as a route for the production of novel antibiotics (4Jacobsen J.R. Hutchinson C.R. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Science. 1997; 277: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Hydroxylations catalyzed by P450 enzymes play key roles in these biosynthetic pathways, and modification of the substrate and regiospecificity of appropriate P450 enzymes is therefore of considerable interest. In an early example, targeted disruption of the gene encoding P450eryF in S. erythraea yielded a strain that was unable to hydroxylate 6-DEB and which therefore produced 6-deoxyerythromycin (3Weber J.M. Leung J.O. Swanson S.J. Idler K.B. McAlpine J.B. Science. 1991; 252: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). P450eryF, a soluble 45-kDa protein, has been crystallized, and its structure has been determined in complexes with both the natural substrate 6-DEB and alternative ligands (5Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 6Cupp-Vickery J. Anderson R. Hatziris Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Two endogenous proteins able to provide electrons for turnover of P450eryFhave been cloned and expressed (7Shafiee A. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1548-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zotchev S.B. Hutchinson C.R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), although spinach ferredoxin and FNR function as acceptable surrogate electron donors (9Andersen J.F. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 725-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of P450eryF reveals two particularly interesting features of the enzyme. One is that the active site is much larger than the active sites of the other structurally defined bacterial P450 enzymes, as expected from the size of its macrocyclic substrate. The second is that the highly conserved threonine, Thr252 in P450cam (CYP101), is replaced in P450eryF by Ala245 (5Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 6Cupp-Vickery J. Anderson R. Hatziris Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The conserved threonine is thought to be required for dioxygen bond cleavage in the activation of molecular oxygen (10Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Mueller E.J. Loida P.J. Sligar S.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 83-142Crossref Google Scholar). The crystal structure of P450eryF shows that the hydrogen bonding interactions normally satisfied by the threonine residue are replaced by hydrogen bonding interactions with the 5-hydroxyl group of the substrate (10Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The resulting requirement for substrate-assisted catalysis in the 6-hydroxylation of 6-DEB makes P450eryF an ineffective catalyst for the oxidation of alternative substrates, even of closely related 6-DEB analogues (2Andersen J.F. Tatsuta K. Gunji H. Ishiyama T. Hutchinson R.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Replacement of Ala245 by a serine or threonine reportedly decreases the rate of 6-DEB hydroxylation to 10% and 1%, respectively, of the wild-type activity (10Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This decrease in activity is thought to reflect disruption of the hydrogen bonding interactions involved in substrate-assisted catalysis by the new side-chain hydroxy group. In P450cam, the most thoroughly characterized P450 enzyme (11Mueller E.J. Loida P.J. Sligar S.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 83-142Crossref Google Scholar, 12Schlighting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar), the conserved threonine (Thr252) clearly plays a critical catalytic role. Replacement of Thr252 by amino acids with non-hydrogen bonding sidechains virtually suppresses camphor hydroxylation in favor of the uncoupled reduction of O2 to H2O2 and H2O (13Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 14Kimata Y. Shimada H. Hirose T. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 208: 96-102Google Scholar, 15Aikens J. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 1143-1144Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In a key experiment, a threonine with a methylated hydroxyl group was introduced and the modified protein was shown to retain high catalytic activity (14Kimata Y. Shimada H. Hirose T. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 208: 96-102Google Scholar). This experiment showed that the threonine may function by hydrogen bonding to a water molecule rather than by directly serving as a proton donor to the distal oxygen atom of the ferrous dioxy complex. This inference is supported by the crystal structure of the P450cam ferrous dioxygen complex (11Mueller E.J. Loida P.J. Sligar S.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 83-142Crossref Google Scholar). In accord with the proposed role for a hydrogen bond in oxygen activation, solvent isotope effect studies of the catalytic cycle have demonstrated that a KSIE of 1.8 is expressed during the second electron transfer step associated with O–O bond cleavage (15Aikens J. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 1143-1144Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). No other step in the catalytic cycle exhibited a significant solvent isotope effect. Studies of the role of the conserved threonine in P450 enzymes have generally provided loss-of-function evidence for its catalytic role, with the exception of the P450cam mutants in which the threonine was replaced by a methyl ether derivative or a serine (14Kimata Y. Shimada H. Hirose T. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 208: 96-102Google Scholar). Here, we carry out a gain-of-function study in which the missing threonine is introduced into P450eryF. This change of an alanine to a threonine makes it possible to oxidize substrates that, unlike 6-DEB, are unable to contribute to substrate-assisted catalysis. The results refine our understanding of the role of the threonine in catalysis. Furthermore, the P450eryF A245T mutant is a good model for the multiple-ligand binding observed with enzymes like CYP3A4, and is a potentially important framework for the design of tailored P450 catalysts. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega. The primers were either purchased from Life Sciences (Manassas, VA) or the Biomolecular Resource Center (University of California, San Francisco, CA). All reagents, testosterone, and 2α-hydroxytestosterone were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. The 2β-, 6α-, 6β-, 7α-, 7β-, 11α-, 11β-, 14α-, 16α-, 18-, and 19-hydroxytestosterone standards were gifts from the Steroid Reference Collection (Medical Research Council, London, United Kingdom). 15α− and 16β-Hydroxytestosterone were purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI). DEAE (DE-52) cellulose was obtained from Whatman (Clifton, NJ) and Red Sepharose CL-6B from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Spinach ferredoxin was purchased from Sigma and was used without further purification. The plasmid pMBPFNR containing the ferredoxin NADP+ reductase (FNR) gene linked to the C terminus of the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein was provided by Dr. A. Aliverti (16Aliverti A. Corrado M.E. Zanetti G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed intoE. coli XL-1 Blue competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and was expressed as described (17Aliverti A. Jansen T. Zanetti G. Ronchi S. Herrmann R.G. Curti B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). FNR was purified as described by Apley et al. (18Apley E.C. Wagner R. Engelbrecht S. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with the modification that only the DEAE and Red Sepharose CL-6B column chromatographies were used. The protein was purified to homogeneity, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and was used without cleavage of the fusion maltose-binding protein. The plasmid pKOS180–125e containing the P450eryF gene was a gift from Kosan Bioscience (Hayward, CA). NdeI and XbaI sites were introduced by overhang polymerase chain reaction at the N and C termini, respectively. The forward primer (start codon in boldface andNdeI site underlined) and reverse primer (stop codon in boldface and XbaI site underlined) were: 5′-G GAA TTCCATA TG A CGA CCG TTC-3′, and 5′-CTA GTCTAGA TT ATC CGT CGA GCC GCAC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NdeI andXbaI restriction enzymes and ligated to the pCWori + (His)6 vector (19Rodriguez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The resulting clone was transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue cells. Insertion of the correct gene was verified by DNA sequencing (Biomolecular Resource Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA) and restriction analysis. The E. coli XL-1 Blue cells containing the pCWori plasmid and expressing P450eryF were grown overnight in 2× YT medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. One liter of 2× YT with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 5 ml of the saturated overnight culture and grown in a 2.8-liter flask at 37 °C to anA 600 of 1.0 (5–6 h). δ-Aminolevulinic acid was added to a final concentration of 80 mg/liter, and the cells were grown at 37 °C for another 1.5 h. The temperature was then lowered to 30 °C, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were grown for an additional 18 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min, resuspended, and then lysed by stirring for 1 h at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 2 mg/ml lysozyme. The cells were sonicated on ice for 5 min (1 min on, 1 min off, 50% power), and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 45,000 ×g for 20 min. The cell-free extract was loaded onto a 10-ml Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) 2.5-cm-diameter column that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole (binding buffer). The column was then washed with 10 volumes of binding buffer followed by 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 20 mm imidazole (wash buffer). The protein was eluted by washing the column with 10 volumes of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m imidazole (eluant buffer). The protein was >90% pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Coomassie Blue staining and was dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) overnight. The enzyme was divided into aliquots and was stored at −70 °C. The yield was 80 mg/liter culture. The P450eryF A245T, A245S, and A245V mutants were constructed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the wild-type P450eryF-(His)6 gene as the template. The specific base substitutions of GCG were ACC for the A245T, TCT for the A245S, and GTT for the A245V mutant. The sequence of the mutant was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the plasmid was transformed into competent E. coli XL-1 Blue cells. The protein was expressed and purified under the same condition as the wild-type protein. The yields were 38, 30, and 12 mg/liter of culture for the A245T, A245S, and A245V mutants, respectively. The steady-state kinetic constants V max and K m were measured in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5, 25 °C) for the hydroxylation of testosterone catalyzed by the A245T mutant. The reaction mixture contained 10 μm A245T P450eryF, 10 mm H2O2, and testosterone (55–700 μm). At selected times, aliquots were quenched with 340 units of catalase, the reaction mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2, and the organic layer was evaporated to dryness at room temperature under a stream of argon. The dried sample was dissolved in the mobile phase before loading onto the HPLC column. The HPLC analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard HP 1090 liquid chromatograph equipped with a C-18 reverse-phase column (Beckman Ultrasphere, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm). The column was eluted isocratically with 70% methanol containing 0.1% triethylamine (pH adjusted to 7.0). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, and the UV detector was set at 254 nm. The retention time for testosterone under these conditions was 10.2 min. Catalysis by P450eryF and its A245T mutant in the presence of electron transport proteins was monitored using an HPLC-based fixed-time assay. The conditions were as follows: 10 μmP450, 20 μm ferredoxin, 5 μm FNR, 250 μm NADP+, 1.7 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 2 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 170 units of catalase, and 100 units of superoxide dismutase in a total volume of 200 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h before they were quenched and subjected to HPLC analysis. The binding constants of wild-type P450eryF and its A245T mutant toward testosterone were determined using difference UV-visible spectroscopy at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm EDTA. The enzyme concentration was 2 μm for wild-type P450eryF and 0.85 μm for the A245T mutant. The reference spectrum was subtracted from the spectrum measured after the addition of testosterone concentrations ranging from 166 to 990 μm. The difference between the peak at 390 nm and the trough at 416 nm was used to calculate the spectroscopic dissociation constantKs (see below). HPLC, TLC, mass spectrometry, and chemical oxidation were used to identify the testosterone metabolites. For mass spectrometric analysis, the testosterone metabolites were separated by HPLC on a preparative C-18 reverse-phase column, the products were collected and dried, and the samples submitted for mass spectrometric analysis by the UCSF Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry Facility. For HPLC analysis, the hydroxylated testosterone standards were profiled by C-18 reverse phase column HPLC with the following gradient: 50% solvent B to 100% solvent B in 30 min, followed by 100% solvent B for 10 min, where solvent A is H2O and solvent B is 50% (v/v) 2-propanol in water. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, and the UV detector was set at 254 nm. Authentic hydroxylated testosterone standards were compared with the testosterone metabolites by co-elution on HPLC using the same elution conditions. Finally, in the case of TLC, the analysis and separation of metabolites were performed on (a) reverse-phase (RP-18) TLC plates with methanol/acetonitrile/H2O (33:33:33) as the mobile phase, and (b) normal phase silica gel plates with hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol (50:50:2.5) as the mobile phase. Further identification of the metabolites was performed by co-elution of the ketone products from oxidation of both the metabolites and the authentic standards with Jones reagent (chromic acid in sulfuric acid and water), which oxidizes disubstituted alcohols to ketones (20Smith S.J. Korzekwa K.R. Aoyama T. Gonzalez F.J. Darbyshire J.F. Sugiyama K. Gillette J.R. Drug Metab. Dis. 1992; 20: 566-571PubMed Google Scholar). Complexed with Testosterone and 6-DEB in the Presence of CO —The UV-visible spectra of reduced wild-type P450eryF and its reduced A245T mutant complexed with 6-DEB were measured in the presence of CO. The incubations contained 2 μm P450, 40 μm6-DEB for the wild-type and 10 μm 6-DEB for the mutants, 8 μm ferredoxin, 2 μm FNR, and 250 μm NADPH. The reduced CO spectra of the enzyme complexed with testosterone (392 μm) were similarly measured. The turnover rate for testosterone hydroxylation catalyzed by the A245T mutant was measured in parallel in H2O and D2O buffers. The reaction mixture contained 10 μm A245T, 10 mmH2O2, and 30–540 μm testosterone in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5 (pD 7.1), and the reaction was carried out at 25 °C (21Glasoe P.K. Long F.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1960; 64: 188-191Crossref Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken at 2, 4, 6, and 8 min, and the reaction was quenched with 340 units of catalase. The unreacted substrate and products were extracted into CH2Cl2 and were analyzed on a C-18 reversed phase column as described earlier. For steady state kinetic analyses, initial velocities were calculated from the slopes of the plots of product or substrate concentration versus reaction time. The kinetic constants were calculated using Equation 1 and the Enzyme Kinetics suite of programs (22Trinity Software Enzyme Kinetics, Version 1.4. Trinity Software, Campton, NH1993Google Scholar). Vo=Vmax[A]/(Km+[A])Equation 1 [A] is the substrate concentration,Vo is the initial velocity,V max is the maximum velocity, andK m is the Michaelis constant. Thek cat was calculated from theV max, and the enzyme concentration was calculated from the difference absorbance of the reduced P450-CO complex at 450 nm versus 490 nm (Δε = 91 mm−1cm−1, values for P450cam) (23Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The Hill coefficient was determined both by nonlinear regression fit (KaleidaGraph, Abelbeck Software) of the data to the Hill equation (Equation 2) and by a linear fit of the data to the logarithmic form of the Hill equation (Equation 3).v=VmaxSn/(K′+Sn)Equation 2 log[v/(Vmax−v)]=nlogS−logK′Equation 3 n is the number of substrate binding sites per enzyme active site, and K′ is a constant comprising interaction factors and intrinsic dissociation constants. For spectral binding assays, the binding constantKs was calculated using Equation 4.ΔA=ΔAmax[A]/(Ks+[A])Equation 4 [A] is the substrate concentration, ΔAis the absorbance change upon substrate binding, ΔA max is the maximum absorbance change, andK s is the dissociation constant. For analysis of substrate inhibition, nonlinear regression (KaleidaGraph, Adelbeck Software) was used to fit the data to a modified two-substrate binding equation (Equation 5) (24Korzekwa K.R.

P450eryF in the original pKOS180–125e vector was expressed in E. coli DH5α cells, and the protein was purified using Q-Sepharose, Mono Q, and Superose 6 chromatographies in a yield of ∼1 mg/liter of culture (2Andersen J.F. Tatsuta K. Gunji H. Ishiyama T. Hutchinson R.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In order to improve the expression level and to simplify the purification, we put a sequence coding for a 6-His tag at the N terminus of the gene and subcloned the gene into the pCWori+ vector. By adding δ-aminolevulinic acid before the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction step, the expression level was greatly improved, so that we obtained ∼80 mg of protein/liter of culture. The activity of wild-type P450eryF-(His)6 toward 6-DEB, measured as reported previously (9Andersen J.F. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 725-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14937-14942Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), showed that the turnover rate of the tagged protein was comparable to that reported earlier for the untagged protein (103 min−1) (2Andersen J.F. Tatsuta K. Gunji H. Ishiyama T. Hutchinson R.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The expression levels of the A245T, A245S, and A245V mutants were somewhat lower than that of the wild-type protein. The purified A245T protein had anA 418/280 ratio of 1.63 and an absorption maximum at 449 nm when reduced with sodium dithionite under an atmosphere of CO (Fig. 2). The absorption maxima of the A245S and A245V Fe2+-CO complexes were also at 449 nm (data not shown). The protein concentration was estimated using the extinction coefficients reported for the P450cam reduced CO-bound form relative to the base-line absorbance at 490 nm (23Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The absorption spectra of the ferric A245T, A245S, and A245V mutants had a maximum at 418 nm that shifted to a small extent to approximately 392 nm when 6-DEB was bound, a spectroscopic shift characteristic of a low to high spin shift similar, albeit smaller, than that observed when 6-DEB binds to wild-type P450eryF (10Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The binding of testosterone to P450eryF and its A245T, A245S, and A245V mutants was determined by difference spectroscopy, a method that reflects the spin state change that accompanies the binding of most ligands within the P450 active site (data not shown). The spectroscopic dissociation constants for the binding of testosterone to P450eryF and its A245T and A245S mutants were nominally 410, 560, and 1500 μm (TableI). No binding of testosterone to the A245V mutant was spectroscopically detected. Due to the limited water solubility of testosterone, Ks values greater than 200 μm, such as these, are approximate. These values are to be compared with the binding of 6-DEB, the natural substrate, which exhibits a Ks value of 2 μm(2Andersen J.F. Tatsuta K. Gunji H. Ishiyama T. Hutchinson R.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Table ISpectroscopic dissociation constants and substrate consumption rates for the oxidation of testosterone by P450eryF and its mutants measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 25 °CEnzymesK sk catH2O2Product ratio H2O2(A:B:C:D)k cat ferredoxin/FNRProduct ratio Ferredoxin/FNR (A:B:C:D) 1-aA zero indicates the value is not detectable.μmmin −1min −1P450eryF410<0.01ND1-bND, not detectable.A245T5600.481:0.14:0.13:0.550.00271:0:0:0.88A245S15000.301:0.38:0.21:0.370.0011:0:0:1A245VNDNDND1-a A zero indicates the value is not detectable.1-b ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab The oxidation of testosterone by P450eryF has been evaluated using two catalytic systems, one supported by spinach ferredoxin and FNR, and the other by H2O2. Spinach ferredoxin and FNR have been used as surrogates for the endogenous electron donor partners of P450eryF (9Andersen J.F. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 725-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic rate for the oxidation of 6-DEB by wild-type P450eryF using the spinach ferredoxin system is reportedly 103 min−1 (2Andersen J.F. Tatsuta K. Gunji H. Ishiyama T. Hutchinson R.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but the enzyme has no detectable ferredoxin-dependent testosterone oxidation activity (Table I). The wild-type enzyme also does not support the H2O2-dependent oxidation of testosterone, as only a negligible turnover of < 0.01 min−1 was observed. In contrast, testosterone is oxidized by the P450eryF A245T and A245S mutants using either O2/ferredoxin/FNR or H2O2 as the source of oxidizing equivalents (Fig.3). The rates of these reactions were estimated by integrating the HPLC areas of the substrate and the four principal products (see below) as a function of time (Table I). For the A245T mutant, these rates were 0.48 and 0.0027 min−1, respectively, for the H2O2 and ferredoxin-dependent reactions, and for the A245S mutant they were 0.30 and 0.001 min−1, respectively. The A245V mutant exhibited no detectable activity in either system. The consumption of testosterone by the A245T mutant, with a k cat of 0.48 min−1, correlates well with the rates of product formation, with product A being formed at a rate of 0.20 min−1 and product D at a rate of 0.13 min−1 (TableII). The two minor products, whose rates could not be accurately determined, presumably account for the remaining 0.12 min−1 rate of testosterone consumption.Table IIRates of consumption of testosterone and formation of metabolites A and D by P450eryF A245TSubstrateA k catD k catk catK mmin −1μmmin −1min −1A245T0.482520.200.13 Open table in a new tab HPLC analysis shows that four major products are formed in the H2O2-dependent oxidation of testosterone by the P450eryF A245T and A245S mutants (Fig.3). The HPLC elution times of the four metabolites were A (4.3 min), B (4.7 min), C (5.3 min), and D (5.6 min). The identities of the four metabolites were established by chromatographic, spectroscopic, and chemical comparisons with a set of authentic hydroxytestosterone standards consisting of 2β-, 6α-, 6β-, 7α-, 7β-, 11α-, 11β-, 14α-, 15α-, 16α-, 16β-, 18-, and 19-hydroxytestosterone. Thus, the mass spectrum of each of the four metabolites exhibited a molecular ion peak at m/z 304, as expected for a monohydroxylated testosterone (data not shown). Coinjection of hydroxylated testosterone standards with the product mixture obtained from the A245T reaction suggested that compound A might be 6β- or 19-hydroxytestosterone, compound B might be 16α-hydroxytestosterone, compound C might be 11α-hydroxytestosterone, and compound D might be 2α-hydroxytestosterone.

Among these, rad52 mutants show the most severe phenotypes, indicating RAD52 has a central role in DSB repair by HR (3Malkova A. Ivanov E.L. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rad52 protein by itself has a single-strand annealing (SSA) activity of two complementary DNA strands, which comprises an alternative pathway to DSB repair by HR (9Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C.

The rad22 + gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe was identified based on its ability to complement the mating type switching defect of a rad22–67 mutant, which has been originally selected by radiation sensitivity (11Schlake C. Ostermann K. Schmidt H. Gutz H. Mutat. Res. 1993; 294: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Ostermann K. Lorentz A. Schmidt H.

The rad22 deletion mutant is inviable in a homothallic background, in which DSB occurs frequently due to mating type switching. The rad22–67 mutant also frequently gives rise to deletions in the mating type region, suggesting that Rad22 protein might be involved in DSB repair (12Ostermann K. Lorentz A. Schmidt H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5940-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of RAD52 in vivo, the biochemical studies have revealed only limited roles for Rad52 as an accessory protein of strand exchange reaction and as a component required in SSA. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that human RAD52 protein (hRAD52) is able to bind to the end of linear duplex DNA in vitro (13Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This suggested a new role of RAD52 as a “gate-keeper” between non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and HR via competition with Ku, another end-binding protein, at the DSB (13Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14Haber J.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 665-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the end-binding property of Rad22 and have provided direct evidence that the Rad52 homologue in S. pombe indeed binds to DSB in vivo. The open reading frame ofrad22 + gene was placed under the control of T7 promoter in pET28b plasmid (Novagen) and was named pET22. For the purification, Rad22 protein was induced by 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in a 1.6-liter culture of BL21(DE3) harboring pET22 for 6 h at 30 °C. The resulting 7.2 g of cells were treated with 560 μg of lysozyme in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) for 30 min on ice and sonicated. The cell lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 30 min and precipitated with 35% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The precipitates were resuspended in 50 ml of buffer K (20 mm KHPO4, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 50 mm KCl and passed through 20 ml of Q Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The flow-through was applied to 20 ml of SP Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the proteins were eluted with 100 ml of a 0.04–0.8m linear gradient of KCl. The Rad22 fractions (around 0.2–0.3 m KCl) were applied to a 5-ml hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad). The proteins were eluted with 25 ml of a 0.02–0.5m linear gradient of KHPO4. Fractions containing Rad22, which were eluted at 0.1–0.2 mKHPO4 were loaded onto a 1-ml denatured DNA cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, and then eluted with 1m KCl. The fractions containing Rad22 were collected and fractionated in 1 ml of Mono Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 20 ml of a 0.04–0.5 m linear gradient of KCl. The fractions at 0.1–0.2 m were pooled, dialyzed against buffer K containing 0.2 m KCl, and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 26,860m−1cm−1. The Plasmid pBluescript SK(+) was prepared using the Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit. φX174 RF I DNA was purchased from New England Biolabs. A 199-base pair rad22 + DNA fragment was radiolabeled by PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The labeled DNA fragment was digested byEcoRI to generate cohesive termini. The concentration of DNA was expressed as moles of nucleotides. ExoIII and RQ1 DNase were purchased from Promega. HaeIII and other restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs or Takara. Electron microscopic analysis was performed according to Griffth et al (15Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Rad22 protein was incubated with 15.4 μm PstI-digested φX174 DNA in 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmMgCl2 for 5 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde (v/v) for 5 min and filtered through 2-ml columns of Bio-Gel A5m (Bio-Rad). The fractions containing the complexes were mixed with a mounting buffer (2 mm spermidine, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.15m NaCl, 0.1 m KCl), and directly mounted to charged carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids. The grids were washed with series of water/ethanol rinses and were tungsten-shadowed. The protein-DNA complexes were visualized on Phillips EM 400 or Hitachi TEM. Linearized pBluescript SK(+) DNA digested with EcoRI (15 μm) was pre-incubated with various amounts of Rad22 at 37 °C for 15 min in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm DTT and subsequently treated with 0.5 unit of restriction endonucleaseHaeIII or exonuclease ExoIII supplemented with appropriate buffers at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were deproteinized with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.5% SDS at 37 °C for 30 min, and the products were resolved in 0.9% agarose gels. The experiment using a 199-base pair PCR product (13 nm) was performed by the same method except that 0.5 unit of RQ1 DNase was used instead of HaeIII and the reaction products were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Experiments were performed as described elsewhere (16Hecht A. Grunstein M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 339-414Google Scholar, 17Ekwall K. Olsson T. Turner B.M. Cranston G. Allshire R.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 1021-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Briefly, for cross-linking of proteins and DNA, exponentially growing cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were harvested and lysed in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate) by vortexing with glass beads. Chromosomes were sheared by sonication to generate DNA of 0.5–1 kilobase pair in length. For immunoprecipitation (IP), 0.5 mg of cell lysate in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer was incubated with immunoaffinity-purified polyclonal anti-Rad22 antisera at 4 °C for 3 h with rotation. The anti-Rad22 antisera were raised from rabbit using glutathioneS-transferase-Rad22 fusion protein as antigen. Then a 10-μl slurry of protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated for another 3 h. The precipitated materials were deproteinized by 100 μg of proteinase K and co-precipitated DNAs were recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. To detect the co-precipitated DNA by PCR, 2 μl of 1/10 diluted DNA recovered from the crude lysate and 2 μl from IP was used as template. Suitable PCR reactions were performed to amplify short fragments ofmat1-M, L region, rhp51 +, andrad22 +. The resulting PCR products were analyzed by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The primers and S. pombe cell strains used in these experiments are listed in TablesI and II, respectively.Table IPCR primers for detection of chromatin IPNameGene amplifiedSequence (5′ to 3′)P1 (upper)mat1-MCCTTCACATTGGATCAATGTP2 (bottom)mat1-MATAACTCAACGCAAATGGGGP3 (upper)L regionCTTCCCCTTCCCTCTAACGP4 (bottom)L regionGCTCTATGGTTGAGGAGGTGG51–315F (upper)rhp51 +CCTATGGGATTTACCACCGC51–495R (bottom)rhp51 +GGTTACCGCAAGTGTATGGCr22–1098 (upper)rad22 +GCGGATCCTTCTATTAGGAAAACCr22–1397 (bottom)rad22 +GCCTTAAGTTTTATCCTTTTTTGG Open table in a new tab Table IIS. pombe strains used for chromatin IPNameCharacteristicsGenotypeJY879Wild type (homothallic)h90 ade6–210 leu1–32 ura4-D18AP136smt-0 (non-switchable)mat1-Msmt-0L(sac1)::ade6+ ade6–210 leu1–32 ura4-D18 his2 Open table in a new tab Chromatographic purification of recombinant Rad22 protein is described under “Experimental Procedures.” The final step of purification yielded a 59.2-kDa protein of over 95% homogeneity, and this protein was used in all subsequent biochemical analyses (Fig. 1 A). Since the observed molecular mass of Rad22 was slightly larger than the expected 52 kDa, the bacterially expressed and the endogenous Rad22 were compared by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the results showed no difference between the two proteins. The DNA binding property of Rad22 protein was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Rad22 formed large protein-DNA complexes at protein to nucleotide ratios higher than 1 to 2,000, which were often lost during the EM preparation processing. We found that at ratios below 1 to 2,000, single multimeric Rad22 protein complex predominantly bound on one molecule of DNA (∼30%, n= 60) on each EM field. As shown in Fig.2, Rad22 bound preferentially to the end of the duplex DNA (∼70% of the Rad22-DNA complexes; Fig. 2,A and B) and sometimes induced recircularization of the linear DNA (Fig. 2 C). Internal binding of Rad22 was also found to a lesser extent than end binding. In this case, Rad22-DNA complex always formed multiple loops (Fig. 2, D–F). Various sizes of Rad22 (ranging from 10 to 35 nm in diameter) were found, suggesting the protein would exist as multimeric forms. Such multimerized Rad22 mediated by self-interaction may explain the recircularization (Fig. 2 C) and loop formation (Fig. 2,D–F). The data above indicate that Rad22 preferentially binds to the end of linear duplex DNA as multimers, although it could also bind internally to the DNA strand. In order to investigate preferential binding of Rad22 to the end of duplex DNA, nuclease protection experiment was performed. Linear plasmid DNA was pre-incubated with various amounts of Rad22 and then digested by the endonuclease HaeIII or the exonucleaseExoIII. The resulting protected DNA was visualized on agarose gel. As shown in Fig.3 A, HaeIII digested most of DNA, implying that Rad22 does not protect DNA fromHaeIII. In contrast, DNA digestion by ExoIII was not observed at the same range (data not shown). Since Rad22 preferentially binds to the end of DNA, Rad22 could protect DNA fromExoIII digestion even at low concentration (Fig.3 B, lanes 6 and 7). Compared with the EM experiment, the protein/nucleotide ratio for DNA protection increased about 100-fold, suggesting that Rad22 would dissociate from the DNA ends over the time course of the experiment. Due to the large size of plasmid DNA, protein/nucleotide ratio could not exceed ∼1 in the experiment above. To rule out the possibility that the failure of endonuclease protection experiment was caused by insufficient supply of protein, we used radiolabeled short 199-base pair DNA as substrate and increased the ratio between protein and nucleotide. Rad22 protected the short DNA from ExoIII digestion as it did with plasmid DNA (Fig. 3 E). In contrast, the digestion of DNA by RQ I DNase could not be avoided even with a 670-fold molar excess of Rad22 to nucleotides (Fig. 3 D,lane 7). In case of ExoIII digestion with the same small DNA fragment, more than 50% of DNA was protected by Rad22 (above 100 nm). The retarded band seen at the highest concentration of Rad22 seemed to result from the incomplete removal of DNA-bound Rad22 by proteinase K (Fig. 3 E,lane 7). These results suggest that Rad22 preferentially binds to the duplex end and partially protects DNA from exonuclease digestion. In order to determine whether Rad22 is able to bind to DSB in vivo, mating type locus was investigated by use of chromatin IP analysis. Mating type switching is preceded by DSB formation in the chromosomal DNA close to the right-hand border of themat1 cassette, designated smt. About 20% of exponentially growing population of homothallic strain contains a DSB at smt (18Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar). In vivo Rad22 binding to DSB atsmt was examined by in vivo DNA-protein cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation. Two sets of PCR primers 214 bp upstream (mat1-M, primers P1 and P2) or 125 bp downstream (L region, primers P3 and P4) of smt were designed and used as primers for PCR amplification (Fig.4 A). After DNA-protein complexes were cross-linked by formaldehyde, Rad22-DNA complexes were isolated by IP with anti-Rad22 antisera. The presence ofmat1-M and L DNA fragments in the complex precipitated by anti-Rad22 antiserum or by pre-immune serum was compared between homothallic wild type strain and smt-0 mutant background. Because the smt-0 mutant does not have a DSB due to an ∼200-bp deletion around smt (19Heim L Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Ayoub N. Goldshmidt I. Cohen A. Genetics. 1999; 152: 495-508PubMed Google Scholar), which also includes P3 primer binding site, amplification of L fragment failed (Fig.4 A) in this strain. Both mat1-M and L fragments were enriched in the Rad22 IP complex from the wild type strain but not in the control IP using pre-immune sera (Fig. 4 B,lanes 2–4, upper panel). In contrast, the same fragments were not observed from the Rad22 IP complex from the smt-0 mutant, while themat1-M fragment was normally amplified from the input DNA recovered from total extract as it was in wild type strain (lanes 5–7, upper panel). Together, these results indicate that a DSB is required for Rad22 binding to smt. In comparison, there is little enrichment of the control DNAs (rhp51 + andrad22 +) from all IP complexes (Fig.4 B, middle and lower panels), showing that the enrichment of mat1-Mand L fragments by anti-Rad22 antisera is highly specific. Western blot analysis indicated that nearly equal amounts of Rad22 protein were expressed and precipitated from both strains (Fig. 4 C). Quantitation analysis revealed that mat1-M and L fragments were enriched in the IP complexes of anti-Rad22 antisera by about 7- and 23-fold respectively, when compared with the IP complex formed by pre-immune sera in wild type strain. However, mat1-M in thesmt-0 strain had no significant change (Fig. 4 D). Together, the data suggest that Rad22 specifically associates with the DSB itself in vivo. In the present study, we demonstrated that Rad22 directly binds to the end of linear duplex DNA and protects DNA from exonuclease digestion in vitro. In addition, we found that Rad22 associates with a DSB at the mating type region. These in vitro and in vivo data suggest that Rad22 protein recognizes and directly associates with DSB in the process of DNA repair. For appropriate DNA repair, DSB should be initially resected by the Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex (21Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Therefore, a very important question is whether Rad52 homologues bind to DSB before or after the resection. Several observations argue that at least prior resection may not be necessary for Rad22 and Rad52 binding to DSB in vitro. hRad52 could bind not only to the end with long single-strand DNA tail, which mimics resected DSB, but also to the blunt end, albeit with lower affinity (13Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Rad22 protected both blunt- or cohesive-ended DNA from exonuclease digestion to the same extent. 2W. J. Kim, S. Lee, M. S. Park, Y. K. Jang, J. B. Kim, and S. D. Park, unpublished observation. These data suggested that a long single-strand tail might not be essential for Rad52 binding to DSB, and Rad52 homologues could act as an initial sensor of DSB before the resection of the ends. Of course, it is conceivable that Rad22 binding to DSB is mating type-specific because rad22 + gene was originally isolated by compensation of switching defect of rad22–67mutant. However, it is unlikely because the rad22 deletion mutant showed phenotypes of impaired DSB repair as well as defect in mating type switching (22Muris D.F.R. Vreeken K. Schmidt H. Ostermann K. Clever B. Lohman P.H.M. Pastink A. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether Rad22 can associate with DSBs incurred by other means such as ionizing radiation. Regarding the biological significance of Rad52 homologues-DSB complex, our results support the idea that Rad52 acts as a gate-keeper between HR and NHEJ, as proposed by Van Dyck et al. (13 ). In this model, DSB binding of hRad52 directs DSB into HR by competing with another end-binding protein Ku, which directs DSB into NHEJ. Since no homologue of Ku has been identified in fission yeast, it is difficult to predict whether the gate-keeping role of Rad22 in recombination is the same as that of hRad52. However, a recent study measuring NHEJ activity in various S. pombe mutants provides a clue that Rad22 would compete with NHEJ components (23Wilson S. Warr N. Taylor D.L. Watts F.Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2655-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Among these mutants, the rad22 deletion mutant showed more than 3-fold increase in NHEJ activity compared with the wild type strain, while little change in NHEJ activity was observed in rhp51 orrhp54 deletion mutants. In addition, the length of nucleotide deletion around the re-joined junction region was slightly increased in the rad22 deletion mutant. These results suggest that Rad22 might bind to the DSB, partially protect the ends from exonuclease digestion, and inhibit the NHEJ by competing with NHEJ components at DSB. Recent biochemical studies proposed the role of Rad52 as a mediator between the single-strand binding protein RPA and the strand-exchange protein Rad51 (4Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 5Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

In this model, Rad52 may bind to RPA, which is located on the single-strand tail at DSB and recruits Rad51 to replace RPA. Rad52 might also be involved in SSA. However, genetic studies ofS. cerevisiae have revealed that, unlike other members of the RAD52 epistasis group, RAD52 is required for all HR events studied so far including Rad51-independent events (reviewed in Ref. 24Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a role as a mediator of Rad51-dependent HR or a component of SSA seems to be insufficient to explain the pleiotrophic phenotypes of rad52deletion mutant. Rather, it is more likely that Rad52 and its homologues may be initial sensors of DSB and act as directors of the DSB repair system. After initial recognition of a DSB, Rad22 and other Rad52 homologues may determine which sub-pathway of HR will be addressed by recruiting proper components depending on the context of substrates. Comparison of functional conservation among Rad52 homologues from different species would be useful to understand the in vivofunction of this family. Unlike RAD52 in S. cerevisiae, its homologues in both S. pombe and vertebrates may not be essential for HR and DSB repair since their deletion mutants do not show severe defects in those processes. BothS. pombe rad22 mutant and vertebrate RAD52knockout cells show only a small reduction of HR and moderate sensitivity to ionizing radiation (22Muris D.F.R. Vreeken K. Schmidt H. Ostermann K.

The gene, named rti1 + (for rad22 isogene 1), was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of temperature-sensitive cell division cycle mutant phenotype ofrad22-H6. rti1 + not only exhibits 65% amino acid identity in the N-terminal half to Rad22 but also suppresses UV and bleomycin sensitivity and sterility of arad22 deletion mutant. Most intriguingly, therad22/rti1 double mutant is inviable (28Suto K. Nagata A. Murakami H. Okayama H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3331-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), indicating that Rad22, together with Rti1, may play the role of Rad52 in S. cerevisiae. Therefore, we suggest that the role of Rad52 in S. cerevisiae may be carried out by several proteins, such as Rad22 and Rti1, in higher eukaryotes. We thank Drs.

[Ca2+]m was measured by loading the cells with the membrane-permeant Ca2+ indicator fluo-3/AM and subsequent removal of cytoplasmic fluo-3 by surface membrane permeabilization with digitonin. An elevation of extramitochondrial Ca2+ resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the rate of Ca2+accumulation into mitochondria (k 0.5 = 3 μm) via the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter. In the presence of 10 mm extramitochondrial Na+([Na+]em), repetitive application of brief pulses of high Ca2+ (2–10 μm) to simulate cytoplasmic [Ca2+] oscillations caused transient increases of [Ca2+]m characterized by a fast rising phase that was followed by a slow decay. Removal of extramitochondrial Na+ or inhibition of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange with clonazepam blocked mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux and resulted in a net accumulation of Ca2+ by the mitochondria. Half-maximal activation of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange occurred at [Na+]em = 4.4 mm, which is well within the physiological range of cytoplasmic [Na+].

Elevations of [Ca2+]i mediate the signal transduction from the plasma membrane agonist receptors to the Ca2+-sensitive intracellular targets, modulating a variety of cellular functions, including secretion, enzyme activation, gene expression, and proliferation. At submaximal agonist concentrations the elevation of [Ca2+]i often occurs in the form of [Ca2+]i oscillations propagating throughout the cell as calcium waves (2Clapham D.E.

A. 1999; 96: 13807-13812Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and to compensate for increased ATP utilization by processes that are regulated by Ca2+(e.g. muscle contraction and secretion) or regulate [Ca2+]i itself, such as Ca2+ ATPases for example. Conversely, the accumulation of Ca2+ by mitochondria affects cytosolic Ca2+ levels; thus mitochondria participate actively in cytosolic Ca2+signaling (for reviews see Refs. 25Babcock D.F. Hille B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar and 26Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). There are two independent pathways for Ca2+ transport in and out of mitochondria (for reviews see Refs. 27Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gunter T.E.

Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondria occurs via an electrogenic uniporter driven by the mitochondrial membrane potential. Ca2+ efflux is mediated by either Na+/Ca2+ (e.g. in heart and brain cells) or H+/Ca2+ exchange (e.g. in liver and smooth muscle). The activity of both Ca2+ influx and efflux mechanisms determines how spatio-temporal patterns of cytoplasmic [Ca2+] would be translated into mitochondrial [Ca2+] and metabolic responses. It has been established previously that agonist stimulation of endothelial cells results in an increase of [Ca2+]i, which leads to subsequent accumulation of Ca2+ by mitochondria (14Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 31Donnadieu E. Bourguignon L.Y.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10753-10759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The mechanisms, however, that are involved in mitochondrial Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]m) regulation in endothelial cells are not well characterized. In the present study we have used permeabilized calf pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells to examine the role of cytoplasmic Na+ in mitochondrial calcium signaling and to test the hypothesis that mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange plays a crucial role in endothelial [Ca2+]mregulation. The results of our experiments show that 1) the mitochondria of permeabilized CPAE cells rapidly accumulate Ca2+ in response to an increase in extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration, 2) the extrusion of Ca2+from mitochondria is primarily mediated by Na+/Ca2+ exchange and is thereby controlled by cytoplasmic [Na+], and 3) inhibition of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange shapes the mitochondrial calcium transients and converts oscillatory changes of [Ca2+]m into sustained increases of [Ca2+]m. The results indicate the important role of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange as well as cytoplasmic [Na+] for the translation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals into the mitochondrial matrix and the regulation of Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial processes. A previous account of this work has been presented in abstract form (33Sedova M. Hüser J. Blatter L.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The CPAE cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CCL-209, Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 mml-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Once a week the cells were dispersed using a Ca2+-free (0.1% EDTA) 0.25% trypsin solution and plated onto glass coverslips for further experiments. Cells from passages 2–6 were used. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C) on single cells in non-confluent cultures. Spatially averaged photometric [Ca2+] measurements from single endothelial cells were performed with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-3. Cells were loaded with 25 μm membrane-permeant acetoxymethyl ester of the dye (fluo-3/AM; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 40 min at 37 °C in standard Tyrode solution containing (in mm concentrations) 135 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, andN-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.3). The fluo-3 fluorescence was excited at 485 nm, and emitted fluorescence was recorded at 535 nm. Fluorescence signals were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 5 Hz. [Ca2+]m is expressed as F/F0,i.e. as fluo-3 fluorescence (F) normalized to the basal fluorescence levels (F0) measured after permeabilization of the surface membrane. Cells were permeabilized by exposure to 10 μm digitonin (see Fig. 1) added to the “intracellular” solution consisting of (in mm concentrations) 135 KCl, 10 NaCl, 20 HEPES, 5 pyruvate, 2 glutamate, 2 malate, 0.5 KH2PO4, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, and 1.86 CaCl2 to yield a free [Ca2+] of ∼100 nm. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM 410, Carl Zeiss, Germany) was used for the co-localization of mitochondrial marker (TMRE) and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals (fluo-3). The potentiometric fluorescent cationic dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, Molecular Probes) was added to the extracellular solution in a concentration of 0.2 μm. Both indicators were excited with the 488 nm line of the argon ion laser, and the emitted fluorescence signals were measured simultaneously at 510–525 nm (fluo-3) and >610 nm (TMRE). The protonophore carbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), ruthenium red, and clonazepam were obtained from Sigma. To measure mitochondrial Ca2+ signals we took advantage of the fact that the acetoxymethyl ester form of fluorescent Ca2+ indicators sequester into intracellular organelles, including mitochondria. For our experiments we exposed intact CPAE cells to fluo-3/AM and subsequently used the non-ionic detergent digitonin to permeabilize the plasma membrane and to remove fluo-3 from the cytosol and nucleus. The effect of digitonin and elevation of extramitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]em) on the time course of the spatially averaged fluo-3 signal from a single cell is shown in Fig. 1 A. After digitonin treatment fluo-3 fluorescence decreased to 20.0 ± 1.3% of the initial level (mean ± S.E., n = 40). This remaining level of fluorescence represents the contribution of mitochondria to the total fluorescence signal. This fluorescence level (F0) was used to normalize the fluo-3 signal. An increase of [Ca2+]em from 0.1 to 2 μm resulted in an increase in fluo-3 fluorescence, suggesting Ca2+ accumulation into the mitochondria. We have used laser scanning confocal microscopy in combination with the potentiometric fluorescent dye TMRE to visualize the mitochondria in CPAE cells. The large potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane results in the accumulation of this cationic dye within the matrix compartment and allows mitochondrial labeling (34Hüser J. Rechenmacher C.E. Blatter L.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2129-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 35Scaduto Jr., R.C. Grotyohann L.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). TMRE was added to extramitochondrial solution in a concentration of 0.2 μm. In Fig. 1 B simultaneously acquired TMRE (red) and fluo-3 (green) images of CPAE cells are shown, following digitonin treatment and the increase of [Ca2+]em to 2 μm. These images are overlaid in the right panel. The TMRE signal is highly co-localized with fluo-3 fluorescence, indicating that the measured fluo-3 signals originated from the mitochondria and report [Ca2+]m. Fig.2 A shows the effect of the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ψ) with FCCP on mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was initiated by elevating [Ca2+]em from 0.1 to 2 μm and measured with fluo-3 trapped inside mitochondria of permeabilized CPAE cells. In the presence of 1 μm FCCP the amplitude of F/F0 measured at 100 s after the elevation of [Ca2+]em amounted to 1.9 ± 0.5versus 8.5 ± 1.2 in control (n= 6; p < 0.0005, Student's t test). In the presence of 10 μm ruthenium red, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, there were no changes in [Ca2+]m following the increase in [Ca2+]em (Fig. 2 B, trace I;n = 4). Ruthenium red applied during the rising phase of the [Ca2+]m transient (arrow) caused the F/F0 signal to decline to the basal level, presumably due to inhibition of Ca2+ uptake and active Ca2+ extrusion (Fig. 2 B, trace II;n = 4). These data indicate that the increase of the fluo-3 signal following the elevation of [Ca2+]emrepresents a Ca2+ uniporter-mediated, Δψ-dependent Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondria. To examine the [Ca2+]em dependence of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, permeabilized cells were exposed to various concentrations of extramitochondrial Ca2+ in the absence of Na+ (Fig. 3 A). At the end of each experiment ionomycin (2 μm) together with high Ca2+ (100 μm) were applied (arrow) to obtain a maximum response and to normalize mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Fig. 3 shows an overlay of normalized traces of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake obtained at [Ca2+]em of 0.8, 1, 1.2, and 10 μm, indicating that increasing [Ca2+]em resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation. We used the rate of increase of the normalized [Ca2+]mtransients to characterize the dose-dependence of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in CPAE cells (Fig. 3 B). To minimize potential problems arising from the non-linear relationship between [Ca2+] and fluo-3 fluorescence, the rate of Ca2+ uptake was determined from the initial linear phase (Fig. 3 B, inset) of the [Ca2+]m increase. Data were fitted with the Hill equation, yielding a Hill coefficient (n H) of 2.7. The [Ca2+]em resulting in a half-maximal rate (k 0.5) of Ca2+ accumulation was 3 μm. There was no activation of the Ca2+uniporter at [Ca2+]em < 0.8 μm. n H > 1 suggested cooperativity of the Ca2+ uptake process. Stimulation of endothelial cells with a low concentration of agonists has been reported to generate [Ca2+]i oscillations (36Jacob R. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Carter T.D. Bogle R.G. Bjaaland T. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 38Sedova M. Klishin A. Hüser J. Blatter L.A. J. Physiol. 2000; 523: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To simulate these oscillatory changes of [Ca2+]i, brief (5–10 s) pulses of high extramitochondrial Ca2+(2–10 μm) were applied to the cells every 100–200 s. Fig. 4 shows the pattern of [Ca2+]m following repetitive exposure to 2 μm Ca2+ for 5 s. In the presence of 10 mm extramitochondrial Na+, repetitive increases of [Ca2+]em caused transient elevations of [Ca2+]m characterized by a fast rising phase followed by a slow decay. Removal of extramitochondrial Na+abolished the decay of [Ca2+]m, suggesting an inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux that resulted in a net accumulation of Ca2+ into mitochondria with each [Ca2+]em pulse. The data from the above experiments (Fig. 4) indicate that Ca2+ removal from endothelial mitochondria is a Na+-dependent process. Fig.5 directly shows the effect of extramitochondrial Na+ concentration ([Na+]em) on [Ca2+]mrecovery. Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondria was activated by increasing [Ca2+]em from 0.1 to 2 μm for 10 s, and the decline of [Ca2+]m was recorded in the presence of different [Na+]em (Fig. 5 A). The value of 1/t ½ (t ½ is the time required for the fluo-3 signal to decrease to half-maximal amplitude) was used to characterize the rate of decline of [Ca2+]m. Ca2+ removal in the presence of 20 mm Na+ was determined to be maximal and served as the reference for normalization, i.e. for each cell the rates of [Ca2+]m decrease for various values of [Na+]em were normalized to the maximal rate of decline recorded in 20 mm Na+. An increase in [Na+]em resulted in a sigmoidal increase in the rate of Ca2+ efflux (Fig. 5 B). The concentration of Na+ giving a half-maximal rate of decrease of [Ca2+]m was 4.4 mm, and the Hill coefficient was 2.2. To determine the effect of inhibition of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange on Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria, [Ca2+]m recovery was studied in the presence of 10 mm extramitochondrial Na+ and increasing concentrations of clonazepam, an inhibitor of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange (39Cox D.A. Matlib M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 938-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 A, cell treatment with 50 μm clonazepam significantly slowed Ca2+extrusion from the mitochondria. The decline of [Ca2+]m during the 5-min time interval after the decrease in [Ca2+]em back to 0.1 μmwas fitted with the monoexponential function. The time constant τ was used as a measure of the rate of Ca2+ extrusion. Dose-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+efflux by clonazepam is shown in Fig. 6 B. Data for each cell are presented as percent inhibition of Ca2+ extrusion (percent inhibition = 100·(1 − τcontrol/τ)). Half-maximal inhibition of Ca2+ extrusion was observed at clonazepam concentrations of ∼5 μm. 50 μm clonazepam almost completely (>95%) abolished Ca2+ extrusion. The inhibition of the [Na+]em-dependent decrease of [Ca2+]m by clonazepam supports the hypothesis that Na+-mediated efflux of Ca2+ from endothelial mitochondria occurs via the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism. Mitochondria are capable of sequestering Ca2+resulting from agonist-induced cytosolic Ca2+ elevations. This accumulation of Ca2+ by mitochondria has 2-fold consequences for cellular processes. It modulates the dynamics of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals (40, 41; for reviews see Refs.25Babcock D.F. Hille B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar and 26Duchen M.R. J.

For example the stimulated production of endothelial-derived relaxing factors (42Palmer R.M. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S.

Henderson A.H. Cardiovasc. Res. 1986; 20: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ accumulation by mitochondria has also been observed in endothelial cells (14Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 31Donnadieu E. Bourguignon L.Y.W.

The membrane-permeant acetoxymethyl ester form of a variety of fluorescent Ca2+ indicators tends to compartmentalize into cellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and mitochondria. Although this is considered a disadvantage for cytosolic [Ca2+] measurements, this property can be used to measure ion concentrations in cellular subcompartments and organelles (e.g. Ref. 45Blatter L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C503-C512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quenching of the cytosolic portion of the dye with Mn2+ or removal of the cytosolic indicator by permeabilization of the plasma membrane has been used for fluorescence measurements originating solely from the mitochondrial matrix. For example, permeabilized cells were used to study the interaction between IP3-sensitive Ca2+ release channels and mitochondria (17Csordás G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We used this approach to investigate the kinetics of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release and to characterize the role of extramitochondrial Na+ for the regulation of [Ca2+]m in vascular endothelial (CPAE) cells. Under physiological conditions the only relevant pathway of Ca2+ entry into mitochondria is the Ca2+ uniporter located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Therefore, the rate of mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation directly reflects the activity of the Ca2+ uniporter. Fig. 3 shows that raising extramitochondrial Ca2+ led to a dose-dependent increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake rates. The [Ca2+]em resulting in a half-maximal Ca2+ influx rate (k 0.5) was 3 μm. The sigmoidal dependence of the Ca2+uptake rate with an n H > 1 (Fig. 3 B) indicates positive cooperativity of the uptake mechanism. Quantitative parameters of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (V max, k 0.5,n H) reported in the literature vary with the experimental conditions and techniques used (for review see Ref. 27Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental approaches similar to ours applied to permeabilized HeLa cells with mitochondrially targeted aequorin (15Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) and rat basophilic leukemia cells loaded with the low affinity Ca2+ dye fura-2FF (17Csordás G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) yielded values for k 0.5 of ∼4 and 10 μm, respectively. We found that mitochondria of permeabilized CPAE cells can sequester large amounts of Ca2+ very rapidly at [Ca2+]em ≥ 5 μm. Exposure to 10 μm Ca2+ led to a rapid rise of [Ca2+]m, which reached a new steady state within 0.5 s (Fig. 3 B). There was no further increase in fluo-3 signal upon subsequent addition of ionomycin and 100 μm Ca2+, indicating saturation of the dye (F max, maximum fluorescence signal). Assuming that F max corresponds to ∼10 μmfree Ca2+, we can estimate a rate of Ca2+accumulation of about 20 μm/s. This value is clearly higher than the uptake rate of 0.8 μm/s (15Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) measured in HeLa cells with wild-type aequorin, a Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein that reliably reports changes of [Ca2+] between 0.3 and ≤ 100 μm (48Blatter L.A. Blinks J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 1141-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Using a mutated low affinity aequorin (Ca2+ sensitivity, 20 μm–1 mm), however, Montero et al.(18Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) measured a Ca2+ uptake rate of ∼35 μm/s (with [Ca2+]em = 10 μm) in chromaffin cells, similar to the value found in our study. A rapid increase of [Ca2+]m following elevations of [Ca2+]i was also found in intact bovine vascular endothelial cells expressing aequorin targeted to mitochondria (14Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). In that study it was shown that an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+, induced by stimulation with ATP, was paralleled by a very rapid increase in [Ca2+]m to over 5 μm. Possible explanations for this rapid accumulation of Ca2+ into the mitochondria were either 1) a close physical association of mitochondria with Ca2+ release sites, exposing these organelles to microdomains of high Ca2+ (15Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar,17Csordás G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 49Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar) or 2) a rapid mode (RAM) of Ca2+ uptake originally described in liver mitochondria (50Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27510-27515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This rapid mode of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was activated by small (<0.4 μm) but fast elevations of extramitochondrial Ca2+. Because we did not see any accumulation of Ca2+ into mitochondria at [Ca2+]embelow 0.5 μm, it seems unlikely that in our experiments Ca2+ uptake occurred via RAM. The experiments illustrated in Fig. 2 B show that mitochondria from vascular endothelial cells possess an efficient mechanism to extrude accumulated Ca2+. Inhibition of Ca2+entry via Ca2+ uniporter by ruthenium red not only stopped mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation but resulted in a decrease of [Ca2+]m, suggesting that mitochondria are capable of extruding accumulated Ca2+. Two mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux mechanisms have been described that differ by their Na+ dependence. Both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent transport exist in a variety of cell types (51Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Favaron M. Azzone G.F. Biochem.J. 1987; 246: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 52Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. Berkoff H.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17983-17989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Na+-dependent Ca2+ extrusion mechanism is predominant in heart, brain, adrenal cortex, and skeletal muscle mitochondria (54Crompton M. Capano M. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 69: 453-462Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 55Crompton M. Moser R. Lüdi H. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and occurs via Na+/Ca2+ exchange (53Li W. Shariat-Madar Z. Powers M. Sun X. Lane R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17983-17989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Crompton M. Künzi M. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 79: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Na+-independent Ca2+ extrusion dominates in liver, lung, and kidney tissue and is carried by H+/Ca2+ exchange, whereas the Na+-dependent mechanism is strongly inhibited by physiological (0.5–1 mm) levels of cytosolic Mg2+ (51Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Favaron M. Azzone G.F. Biochem.J. 1987; 246: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 57Wingrove D.E. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15166-15171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our study shows that the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism is the major pathway for Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria in the vascular endothelium (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6; see also Ref. 58Jornot L. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Junod A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1013-1022PubMed Google Scholar). Lowering extramitochondrial Na+ concentration or pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange turned [Ca2+]m signals from transient or oscillatory into prolonged and continuous elevations. In that sense the activity of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange directly determines the time during which Ca2+-sensitive mitochondrial targets, such as Ca2+-dependent enzymes controlling mitochondrial metabolic activity, are exposed to elevated [Ca2+]. Under the premise that Ca2+ extrusion from endothelial mitochondria occurs solely via mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange, it becomes obvious that [Na+]i plays a crucial role in the regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis in endothelial cells. Whether changes in Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity occur in intact cells in response to changes in cytosolic [Na+] depends on the affinity (k m) of the exchanger for extramitochondrial Na+ and the concentration of free cytosolic Na+. In our study the [Na+]em that resulted in a half-maximal rate of Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria was 4.4 mm. This [Na+] is comparable with k m values of 2.6–9.4 mm for the Na+ dependence determined for heart and liver mitochondria (39Cox D.A. Matlib M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 938-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Favaron M. Azzone G.F.

The level of cytosolic free Na+ in a variety of non-excitable cells was estimated to be in the range of 4–12 mm (60Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P. Eckert B.K. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19458-19467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Sage S.O. Rink T.J. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14632-14636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These levels of [Na+]i together with the measured [Na+] dependence of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange suggest that the exchanger actively controls [Ca2+]m and that relatively small changes of [Na+]i (as they may occur under a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions) might be significant enough to alter mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity and [Ca2+]m. We found that Ca2+ extrusion via Na+/Ca2+ exchange was maximal at [Na+]em of 20 mm, a value very similar to that found in liver, kidney, and lung mitochondria (52Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. Berkoff H.A. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 59Heffron J.J. Harris E.J. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The dependence of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+exchange on [Na+]i further emphasizes the role of cellular mechanisms that regulate [Na+]i itself (i.e. the plasmalemmal Na+/Ca2+ and Na+/H+ exchange mechanisms, the Na+/K+ pump, and Na+-permeable channels) for mitochondrial function. Control of Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria might be a physiological role of the [Na+]i increase seen in agonist-stimulated cells (60Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P. Eckert B.K. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19458-19467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Sage S.O. Rink T.J. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J.

Physiol. 2000; 524: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it becomes apparent that [Na+]i plays a critical dual role in the regulation of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial [Ca2+]. For example, it has been demonstrated that [Na+]igradients are important for the regulation of the Ca2+-dependent nitric-oxide synthase activity and agonist-evoked Ca2+ oscillations through local increases of [Ca2+]i mediated by the plasmalemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism (63Paltauf-Doburzynska J.

The present study established further evidence for the importance of intracellular sodium for the regulation of both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca2+ levels and the control of Ca2+-dependent processes in both of these cellular compartments.

GST-5 has recently been characterized as a novel GalNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase termed chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase-2 (Kitagawa, H., Fujita, M., Itio, N., and Sugahara K. (2000) J. Biol.

All mucin-associated [35S]sulfate was incorporated as GlcNAc-6-sulfate or Galβ1→4GlcNAc-6-sulfate. GST-5 was also expressed in soluble epitope-tagged form and found to catalyze 6-O-sulfation of GlcNAc residues in synthetic acceptor structures. In particular, GST-5 was found to catalyze 6-O-sulfation of β-benzyl GlcNAc but not α- or β-benzyl GalNAc. In the mouse genome we have found a homologous ORF that predicts a novel murine GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase with 88% identity to the human enzyme. This gene was mapped to mouse chromosome X at band XA3.1-3.2.

Further diversity is generated by the covalent attachment of sulfate (−SO3−) to distinct hydroxyl and amino groups in these saccharides (2Hooper L.V. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As sulfate modifications can be extensive and tend to occur in clusters in glycoproteins, they can have a profound effect on the physicochemical character of the glycoconjugate, at least in part by conferring a negative charge at physiological pH (3Bowman K.G. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R9-R22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, regioselective sulfation of carbohydrates frequently generates specific epitopes that can be recognized by hormones, extracellular matrix proteins, cell surface receptors, and viruses (2Hooper L.V.

In this context, sulfation of carbohydrates has been shown to be a critical structural requirement of the ligand determinants recognized by the leukocyte adhesion molecule L-selectin (5Rosen S.D.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). L-selectin is a lectin-like cell adhesion molecule that mediates tethering and rolling of lymphocytes along high endothelial venules (HEV),1 which is the first requisite step in the process of lymphocyte extravasation into lymph nodes (7Butcher E.C.

Leffler H. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12035-12047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These observations prompted considerable interest in the molecular identification of the sulfotransferase enzymes that facilitate 6-O-sulfation at Gal or GlcNAc within mucin-type acceptor saccharides. Habuchi and colleagues (10Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol.

These workers then showed that the same enzyme can also add sulfate to the 6-hydroxyl group of Gal in sialyl N-acetyllactosamine, a structure known to occur in HEV-associated ligands (11Habuchi O.

In order to identify novel Gal or GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferases in human and mouse, we performed homology searches (BLAST) on appropriate data bases for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) homologous to avian C6ST. The ESTs retrieved in our searches mapped to four separate genes, which we have termed GST1 through GST4 (GST = Gal/GalNAc or GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase).

The identity of a putative high endothelial cell galactose 6-O-sulfotransferase that is predicted to be functional in biosynthesis of 6′-sulfosialy N-acetylactosamine or 6′-sulfosialyl Lewis X in HEV-associated L-selectin ligands has remained obscure. We have therefore continued to screen data bases for ESTs that may map to novel GST genes. In this search we have found an open reading frame predicted to code for a novel member of the GST family on a human genomic DNA clone from chromosome Xp11 (GenBankTM accession number AL022165). A human cDNA containing the same open reading frame has very recently been reported to encode a novel N-acetylgalactosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase termed chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase-2 (C6ST-2) (26Kitagawa H. Fujita M. Ito N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21075-21080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number AB037187). We have named the novel enzyme GST-5 and characterized its enzymatic activity and acceptor specificity on synthetic oligosaccharide substrates as well as by co-transfection with the recombinant mucin GlyCAM-1. In our hands GST-5 catalyzes 6-O-sulfation at GlcNAc in oligosaccharide substrates as well as GlyCAM-1 and does not act on simple GalNAc glycosides. We have also identified a GST-5 homologous open reading frame in the mouse genome and mapped it to mouse chromosome X at band XA3.1–3.2. The following commercial materials were used: carrier-free [35S]PAPS was either synthesized as described previously (27Bowman K.G. Hemmerich S. Bhakta S. Singer M.S. Bistrup A. Rosen S.D.

Restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and Taqpolymerase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals unless specified otherwise. Pfu-polymerase was from New England Biolabs.

The benzylglycosides examined for suitability as substrates (Fig. 7) except for GalNAcβ1→OBn were all purchased from Sigma. The latter was synthesized as described below. Our disaccharide neoglycolipid substrate for sulfotransferases, GlcNAcβ1→6Galα1→N-octylpropanamide (disaccharide), was synthesized as described elsewhere (21Cook B.N. Bhakta S. Biegel T. Bowman K.G.

All three neoglycolipid substrates (including GlcNAcβ1→O(CH2)7CH3, see below) were purified by C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Varian Dynamax 100A) using a water acetonitrile gradient (10–60% CH3CN) at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 300, 400, or 500 MHz on a Bruker AMX or DRX NMR spectrometer, and 13C spectra were recorded at 75, 100, or 125 MHz on the same spectrometers at the University of California, Berkeley NMR facility. Spectral data are tabulated as chemical shifts in ppm (δ) downfield from tetramethylsilane, followed by multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets, t, triplet; m, multiplet), integration, and coupling constant(s) (J) in Hz.

The solution was heated to 50 °C and stirred overnight under argon. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and 4-Å sieves were added. After 30 min, 100 ml of 1-octanol (82.7 g, 635 mmol) was added, and the solution was stirred for 48 h at room temperature under argon. The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite, rinsing with 1:1 CHCl3/MeOH. After concentration and dilution in CH2Cl2, the organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO3, water, and brine. The organic layer was dried over Mg2SO4 and concentrated. The resulting residue was recrystallized from boiling ethyl acetate/hexanes.

A kanamycin-resistant Escherichia coli stab culture harboring a P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) containing human genomic clone 71L16 (GenBankTM accession numberAL022165) from genomic library RPCI-1 was obtained from the Sanger Center, Cambridge, United Kingdom. PAC-DNA was prepared using the KB100 plasmid kit (Genome Systems) according to the manufacturer's specifications. An ampicillin-resistant E. coli glycerol stock harboring a plasmid containing IMAGE clone 2106380 (GenBankTM accession number AI419198) in the vector pT7T3D-Pac was obtained from Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiaprep 500 plasmid kit (Qiagen). A 368-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 238–605 in the human GST5 ORF (Fig. 1) was labeled with [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to probe Northern blots of various human tissue RNAs (Human Multiple Tissue Northern blots,CLONTECH) as described previously (16Bistrup A.

The blot was then stripped and rehybridized with a probe for actin mRNA as described (16Bistrup A. Bhakta S. Lee J.K. Belov Y.Y. Gunn M.D. Zuo F.R. Huang C.C. Kannagi R. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. J.

The incomplete GST-5 cDNA (2061 bp) contained in the above IMAGE plasmid (AI419198) was excised withNotI and EcoRI and ligated into pCDNA3.1(+) between NotI (5′) and EcoRI (3′). For 5′ complementation of this cDNA as predicted by the genomic ORF (GenBankTM accession number AL022165) the following complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized: 5′-GGCCGCAAGCTTATGAAGGGCCGGCGGCGGCGACGCCGAGAGTACTGCAAGTTCGCGCTGCTGTTGGTGCTGTACACGCTGGTGCTGTTGCTCGTCCCCTCCGTATTGGACGGC-3′, 5′-GGCCGCCGTCCAATACGGAGGGGACGAGCAACAGCACCAGCGTGTACAGCACCAACAGCAGCGCGAACTTGCAGTACTCTCGGCGTCGCCGCCGCCGGCCCTTCATAAGCTTGC-3′. These oligonucleotides were annealed, 5′-phosphorylated, and ligated into the NotI site of above plasmid pCDNA3.1(+)AI419198, using established techniques (28Sambrook J. Ftisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The resulting expression plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)FLhuGST5 was sequenced on both strands between the 5′ NotI site and the 3′ EcoRI site. The sequence of the 2152-bp full-length human GST-5 cDNA contained in this expression plasmid is identical to the sequence reported by the Sugahara team (26Kitagawa H. Fujita M. Ito N. Sugahara K. J.

In order to direct secretion of recombinant soluble GSTs bearing N-terminal His6 tags, a modified pSecTagHis vector was constructed that possessed a His6 epitope tag encoding sequence immediately following the IgK secretion signal and preceding the multiple cloning site. This design provided for the expression of a secreted protein with an N-terminal His6 tag. The pSecTagHis vector was derived from the commercial pSecTag2A vector as follows: a PCR product was amplified from the commercial vector using primers, 5′-CGGGAGATCTCCCGATCCCCTATGG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGGATCCATGATGATGATGATGATGGGCCGCGTCACCAGTTGGAACCTGGAACC-3′. This amplicon as well as the template vector pSecTag2A were digested with BglII and BamHI, then the amplicon was ligated back into the vector yielding the modified expression vector pSecTagHis. A cDNA fragment encoding residues 32 through 486 of human GST5 was amplified from the 71L16 PAC DNA using primers 5′-CAGCCCAGTGTGGTGGGACGGCGGCCGCGACGGGGAC-3′ and 5′-GCTGCCACTGTGCTGGCTACGTGGCGCCGTCGGCATC-3′. PCR amplification was carried out with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) at 94 °C for 3 min, with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 in 7% (v/v) Me2SO. The resulting amplicon was purified using MoBio Ultraclean PCR Cleanup kit, digested withBstX (New England BioLabs), and ligated into theBstX site of the modified expression vector pSecTagHis (described above). The final construct pSecTagHis6 GST5 was sequenced along both strands and found to encode a fusion protein in which the peptide METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTGDAAHHHHHHGSTPVWW was fused to the N terminus of the luminal domain of human GST-5 (amino acids 32–486).

Inactivation was accompanied by an increase in absorbance at 240 nm with no change in absorbance at 280 nm, and treatment of the inactivated enzyme with hydroxylamine restored 95% activity, results that indicated diethylpyrocarbonate inactivates the enzyme by the specific modification of histidine. The substrates ATP, ADP, acetate, and acetyl phosphate protected against inactivation suggesting at least one active site where histidine is modified. Correlation of residual activity with the number of histidines modified, as determined by absorbance at 240 nm, indicated that a maximum of three histidines are modified per subunit, two of which are essential for full inactivation.

In subsequent steps of the pathway, the methyl group is reduced to methane with electrons gained from oxidation of the carbonyl group to carbon dioxide. ATP synthesis is coupled to methane production through an electrochemical ion gradient generated by a membrane-bound electron transport chain.Acetate kinase has been purified from numerous prokaryotes (2Fox D.K.

The E. coli acetate kinase is phosphorylatedin vitro by ATP or acetyl phosphate, and the phosphoenzyme is competent to transfer its phosphate group to either ADP or acetate, suggesting a covalent mechanism involving a phosphoenzyme intermediate (2Fox D.K.

The phosphoenzyme intermediate is a phosphoryl donor to enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system of both E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium (2Fox D.K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13487-13497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, phosphorylation of acetate kinase may not be a consequence of the kinase mechanism but may instead play a role in other cellular processes. Furthermore, stereochemical studies reveal that the reaction catalyzed by acetate kinase proceeds with net steric inversion of the phosphate group (15Blattler W.A. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3927-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because participation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate would result in net retention of the phosphate configuration, this result suggests a direct in-line transfer of the phosphoryl group from the donor to the acceptor. Alternatively, a covalent triple displacement mechanism involving two phosphoenzyme intermediates and three in-line phosphate transfers has been proposed to reconcile the apparent conflicting observations of a phosphoenzyme and net steric inversion of the phosphate group (16Spector L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Histidine residues have a high probability of serving as phosphorylation sites in the triple displacement mechanism; thus, the identification of active site histidines and the role they play in catalysis is important for distinguishing between the proposed direct in-line and covalent triple displacement mechanisms.It was concluded that an unspecified histidine in theAcinetobacter calcoaceticus acetate kinase (4Kim Y.S. Park C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 956: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) is essential for catalysis based only on DEP1 inactivation studies. Preliminary chemical modification studies have suggested that one or more unspecified histidines play a role in the enzymatic mechanism of the acetate kinase from Methanosarcina thermophila (17Latimer M.T. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6822-6829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We combined chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis approaches to further investigate the role of histidine residues in the catalytic mechanism of the M. thermophila enzyme. We identified two active site histidines (His-123 and His-180) whose modification by DEP inactivates the enzyme. The results show that His-123 has no role in catalysis and that phosphorylation of His-180 is not essential for catalysis. The results presented here, combined with recently published results, favor a direct in-line mechanism.DISCUSSIONThe identification of active site residues essential for catalysis is critical to resolving which of the two proposed phosphoryl transfer mechanisms, direct in-line transfer or covalent triple displacement, apply to acetate kinase. The triple displacement mechanism requires phosphorylation of two residues. Potential candidates are three histidines (His-123, His-180, and His-208) present in the M. thermophila enzyme that are perfectly conserved among 56 acetate kinase homologs; indeed, these residues are located in the vicinity of the active site as determined by the crystal structure of the M. thermophila enzyme complexed with ATP. 2M. Hasson and D. Sanders, personal communication. A previous report based only on DEP inactivation studies concluded that an unspecified active site histidine is essential for catalysis by the A. calcoaceticus acetate kinase (4Kim Y.S. Park C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 956: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). However, inactivation studies alone can be misleading; thus, we combined both DEP inactivation and site-directed mutagenesis approaches to determine whether histidine is essential for catalysis by the acetate kinase from M. thermophila.Three lines of evidence support that DEP inactivation of the M. thermophila acetate kinase is specific for histidine: (i) a robust second order rate constant for inactivation, (ii) increased absorbance at 240 nm correlated with decreased activity, and (iii) restoration of activity by hydroxylamine. Either two or three histidines are modified as determined by absorbance at 240 nm and correlation of the rate of inactivation to the number of histidines modified. A statistical treatment of these data indicated that three histidines are modified, two of which fully inactivate the enzyme. This conclusion is supported by the biphasic plot of residual activity versus the number of modified histidines and the fact that only two variants (H180A and H123A) were less sensitive to DEP inactivation compared with the wild type enzyme. The plot of modified residues versus residual activity of the wild type enzyme, when protected by acetyl phosphate, suggested that one histidine is modified that is incompetent to inactivate the enzyme. This result further suggests a total of three histidines is modified, assuming that the modification of two histidines is necessary for full inactivation of the unprotected enzyme. Substrate protection of the wild type enzyme from DEP inactivation indicated that at least one of the modified histidines is located in the active site. Indeed, acetyl phosphate protected both the H180A and H123A variants from DEP inactivation, which indicates that His-123 and His-180 are in the active site as suggested by the crystal structure.The combined results indicate that His-123 and His-180 are two active site residues that, when modified, fully inactivate the M. thermophila acetate kinase. Two observations for the wild type enzyme are in apparent conflict with this conclusion: (i) the protection of only one histidine by acetyl phosphate correlated with 100% protection of wild type activity and (ii) a reaction order of 0.96 was determined with respect to DEP. The simplest explanation for these observations is that modification of one histidine is dependent on prior modification of the other. This explanation is consistent with the biphasic plot of residual activity versus the number of modified histidines. This explanation is, however, only partly consistent with DEP inactivation patterns obtained for the H123A and H180A variants. It was expected that one of the variants would be insensitive to inactivation whereas the other would be partially inactivated and 100% protected by acetyl phosphate. The H123A variant was partially inactivated by DEP and 100% protected by acetyl phosphate, results suggesting that His-180 is the first residue modified. It was unexpected, however, that H180A was also partially inactivated. Apparently, either replacement of His-180 induces a conformational change such that His-123 becomes susceptible to modification without prior modification of His-180 or His-208 is modified by DEP and repositioned in the active site to inactivate the enzyme. These possibilities were examined with double and triple variants in which His-123 and His-180 or His-123, His-180, and His-208 were replaced; however, these variants were inactive, which leaves this issue unresolved.Kinetic analysis of variants obtained by alanine replacement of the eight conserved histidines revealed that, except for His-180, no other histidines are essential for catalysis. The Km values for acetate and ATP were only slightly altered for the H180A variant but the k cat was reduced over 100-fold. The question of a catalytic role for this residue was addressed by replacing it with six residues containing diverse functional groups. Remarkably, all six variants had k cat values that were greater than 50% of the wild type value, except H180R which had a lower, albeit substantial, k cat relative to the wild type enzyme. Although glutamine and asparagine are potential phosphorylation sites in the H180E and H180D variants, the other residues examined at position 180 (Lys, Arg, Gln, and Asn) are unlikely to be phosphorylated; thus, the uniformly robustk cat values for all six variants strongly indicate that phosphorylation of His-180 is not essential for catalysis. Although these results cannot rule out the possibility that either His-123 or His-208 is repositioned in the variants and rescues an essential catalytic function of His-180, it is unlikely that thek cat of all six His-180 variants would be rescued to the extent observed. None of the His-180 variants hadKm values for acetate or ATP that were significantly changed from the wild type value, suggesting that His-180 is not involved in binding these substrates. TheKm values for the H123A and H208A variants were also not significantly changed from the wild type value, suggesting that the active site His-123 and His-208 residues are not involved in binding acetate or ATP.Singh-Wissmann et al. (35Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3671-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) recently reported the identification of two active site arginine residues (Arg-91 and Arg-241) in the M. thermophila acetate kinase that are essential for catalysis. They proposed that these residues play a role in stabilization of a pentacoordinate transition state. The identification of only two catalytically essential arginine residues is more consistent with a direct in-line transfer than a covalent triple displacement mechanism because the latter would presumably involve three pentacoordinate transition states and as many as nine residues for their stabilization. Evidence has also been obtained for a transition state analog of MgADP-AlFx-acetate for the acetate kinase from M. thermophila, 3R. D. Miles and J. G. Ferry, manuscript in preparation. which further argues for a direct in-line mechanism. His-208, in addition to His-123 and His-180, is located in the vicinity of the active site in the crystal structure of the M. thermophila acetate kinase. All three of these histidines are perfectly conserved among the 56 acetate kinase sequences available in the data bases; thus, if the covalent mechanism were operable it is very likely that one or more of these three histidines would be essential for catalysis by serving as sites for phosphoenzyme intermediates. The finding that none of the three active site histidines in the M. thermophila enzyme is essential for catalysis is inconsistent with the triple displacement mechanism.Although the results indicate that phosphorylation of His-180 is not essential for catalysis, it cannot be ruled out that this histidine is essential for other functions. His-180 could potentially function as a hydrogen bond donor or provide a positive charge for stabilization of the pentacoordinate transition state proposed for the direct in-line mechanism (15Blattler W.A. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3927-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Romaniuk and Eckstein (36Romaniuk P.J. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7322-7328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed a similar direct in-line mechanism in which hydrogen bonding interactions and Mg2+ play an important role in delocalizing the negative charge of the transition state. Except for H180A, all other His-180 variants had replacement residues that could potentially serve as hydrogen bond donors or provide a positive charge to stabilize the transition state. His-180 may also be essential for spatial packing to maintain the correct conformation of the active site. Spatial packing is of added importance for kinases because exclusion of water in the active site is critical to prevent hydrolysis of phosphate groups (37Anderson C.M. Zucker F.H. Steitz T.A. Science. 1979; 204: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although further experimentation is necessary to draw firm conclusions, the results presented here combined with recent published (35Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3671-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and unpublished results favor the direct in-line mechanism. Acetate kinase is of major importance in the metabolism of prokaryotes, especially in the energy-yielding metabolism of anaerobes.

This conclusion is supported by the biphasic plot of residual activity versus the number of modified histidines and the fact that only two variants (H180A and H123A) were less sensitive to DEP inactivation compared with the wild type enzyme. The plot of modified residues versus residual activity of the wild type enzyme, when protected by acetyl phosphate, suggested that one histidine is modified that is incompetent to inactivate the enzyme. This result further suggests a total of three histidines is modified, assuming that the modification of two histidines is necessary for full inactivation of the unprotected enzyme. Substrate protection of the wild type enzyme from DEP inactivation indicated that at least one of the modified histidines is located in the active site. Indeed, acetyl phosphate protected both the H180A and H123A variants from DEP inactivation, which indicates that His-123 and His-180 are in the active site as suggested by the crystal structure. The combined results indicate that His-123 and His-180 are two active site residues that, when modified, fully inactivate the M. thermophila acetate kinase. Two observations for the wild type enzyme are in apparent conflict with this conclusion: (i) the protection of only one histidine by acetyl phosphate correlated with 100% protection of wild type activity and (ii) a reaction order of 0.96 was determined with respect to DEP. The simplest explanation for these observations is that modification of one histidine is dependent on prior modification of the other. This explanation is consistent with the biphasic plot of residual activity versus the number of modified histidines. This explanation is, however, only partly consistent with DEP inactivation patterns obtained for the H123A and H180A variants. It was expected that one of the variants would be insensitive to inactivation whereas the other would be partially inactivated and 100% protected by acetyl phosphate. The H123A variant was partially inactivated by DEP and 100% protected by acetyl phosphate, results suggesting that His-180 is the first residue modified. It was unexpected, however, that H180A was also partially inactivated. Apparently, either replacement of His-180 induces a conformational change such that His-123 becomes susceptible to modification without prior modification of His-180 or His-208 is modified by DEP and repositioned in the active site to inactivate the enzyme. These possibilities were examined with double and triple variants in which His-123 and His-180 or His-123, His-180, and His-208 were replaced; however, these variants were inactive, which leaves this issue unresolved. Kinetic analysis of variants obtained by alanine replacement of the eight conserved histidines revealed that, except for His-180, no other histidines are essential for catalysis. The Km values for acetate and ATP were only slightly altered for the H180A variant but the k cat was reduced over 100-fold. The question of a catalytic role for this residue was addressed by replacing it with six residues containing diverse functional groups. Remarkably, all six variants had k cat values that were greater than 50% of the wild type value, except H180R which had a lower, albeit substantial, k cat relative to the wild type enzyme. Although glutamine and asparagine are potential phosphorylation sites in the H180E and H180D variants, the other residues examined at position 180 (Lys, Arg, Gln, and Asn) are unlikely to be phosphorylated; thus, the uniformly robustk cat values for all six variants strongly indicate that phosphorylation of His-180 is not essential for catalysis. Although these results cannot rule out the possibility that either His-123 or His-208 is repositioned in the variants and rescues an essential catalytic function of His-180, it is unlikely that thek cat of all six His-180 variants would be rescued to the extent observed. None of the His-180 variants hadKm values for acetate or ATP that were significantly changed from the wild type value, suggesting that His-180 is not involved in binding these substrates. TheKm values for the H123A and H208A variants were also not significantly changed from the wild type value, suggesting that the active site His-123 and His-208 residues are not involved in binding acetate or ATP. Singh-Wissmann et al. (35Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3671-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) recently reported the identification of two active site arginine residues (Arg-91 and Arg-241) in the M. thermophila acetate kinase that are essential for catalysis. They proposed that these residues play a role in stabilization of a pentacoordinate transition state. The identification of only two catalytically essential arginine residues is more consistent with a direct in-line transfer than a covalent triple displacement mechanism because the latter would presumably involve three pentacoordinate transition states and as many as nine residues for their stabilization. Evidence has also been obtained for a transition state analog of MgADP-AlFx-acetate for the acetate kinase from M. thermophila, 3R. D. Miles and J. G. Ferry, manuscript in preparation. which further argues for a direct in-line mechanism. His-208, in addition to His-123 and His-180, is located in the vicinity of the active site in the crystal structure of the M. thermophila acetate kinase. All three of these histidines are perfectly conserved among the 56 acetate kinase sequences available in the data bases; thus, if the covalent mechanism were operable it is very likely that one or more of these three histidines would be essential for catalysis by serving as sites for phosphoenzyme intermediates. The finding that none of the three active site histidines in the M. thermophila enzyme is essential for catalysis is inconsistent with the triple displacement mechanism. Although the results indicate that phosphorylation of His-180 is not essential for catalysis, it cannot be ruled out that this histidine is essential for other functions. His-180 could potentially function as a hydrogen bond donor or provide a positive charge for stabilization of the pentacoordinate transition state proposed for the direct in-line mechanism (15Blattler W.A. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3927-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Romaniuk and Eckstein (36Romaniuk P.J. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7322-7328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed a similar direct in-line mechanism in which hydrogen bonding interactions and Mg2+ play an important role in delocalizing the negative charge of the transition state. Except for H180A, all other His-180 variants had replacement residues that could potentially serve as hydrogen bond donors or provide a positive charge to stabilize the transition state. His-180 may also be essential for spatial packing to maintain the correct conformation of the active site. Spatial packing is of added importance for kinases because exclusion of water in the active site is critical to prevent hydrolysis of phosphate groups (37Anderson C.M. Zucker F.H. Steitz T.A. Science. 1979; 204: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although further experimentation is necessary to draw firm conclusions, the results presented here combined with recent published (35Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3671-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and unpublished results favor the direct in-line mechanism."

This paper describes new studies with the E. coli enzyme that are strongly supportive of the proposed radical mechanism (SchemeFS1 A). The product of the reaction with the inhibitor (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP has been identified, allowing the formation of the stable flavin semiquinone radical in the presence of dithionite to be rationalized. The formation of a flavin semiquinone radical during turnover of (6S)-6-fluoro-EPSP has been observed in the presence of dithionite. In addition, the lack of activity of the monofunctional E. coli enzyme with 5-deaza-FMN has been demonstrated. All chemicals and biochemicals were of the highest grade available and, unless stated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma. Sodium dithionite was purchased from BDH (Poole, Dorset, U K). The potassium salt of EPSP was prepared as described previously (17Bornemann S. Balasubramanian S. Coggins J.R. Abell C. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Both (6S)- and (6R)-6-fluoro-shikimate (18Sutherland, J. K., Watkins, W. J., Bailey, J. P., Chapman, A. K., and Davies, G. M. (1989) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1386–1387.Google Scholar) were supplied by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals. The 6-fluoro-shikimates were converted to the corresponding 6-fluoro-EPSPs using shikimate kinase and EPSP synthase as described previously (19Balasubramanian S. Davies G.M. Coggins J.R. Abell C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 8945-8946Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with modifications. The reactions were monitored using HPLC. The products were purified using FPLC without the need for the degradation of ATP and ADP by apyrase. The purified products were freeze-dried directly without the need for barium precipitation and quantified by HPLC using EPSP as a standard. 5-Deaza-FAD was obtained from Prof. Sandro Ghisla, University of Konstanz, Germany. All spectrophotometric measurements were obtained with a 1.0-cm path length. All experiments with chorismate synthase were performed at 25 °C, and solutions were buffered using 50 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.5, unless otherwise stated. Recombinant E. coli chorismate synthase was purified as reported previously (17Bornemann S. Balasubramanian S. Coggins J.R. Abell C. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and enzyme concentration was determined using ε280 = 21,440 m−1cm−1 per subunit (20Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The enzyme was assayed directly by UV spectrophotometry as described previously (21Ramjee M.K. Coggins J.R. Thorneley R.N.F. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and substrate concentrations were determined using this method. Anaerobic assay mixtures contained substrate (50 μm), FMN (10 μm), potassium oxalate (1 mm), and buffer. The FMN was photoreduced for 3 min with a 250-watt halogen bulb light source with oxalate being the electron source, before the addition of the enzyme to give a final volume of 500 μl. The addition of analogues and the order of addition of assay components was altered where indicated. One unit of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 1 μmol of substrate to product in 1 min. Chorismate synthase (1.9 μmol in 8 ml of MOPS buffer containing 20% glycerol) was combined with FMN (1.9 μmol) and made anaerobic using repeated vacuum/N2 flush cycles. (6R)-6-Fluoro-EPSP (1.9 μmol in 0.33 ml of water) was separately made anaerobic in the same way. MOPS buffer and methanol were made anaerobic by sparging with N2 for >1 h. All solutions were subsequently handled in an anaerobic glove box maintained at <1 ppm O2 (Belle Technology, Portesham, Dorset, UK). A sodium dithionite solution (10 mm) was made up in the glove box and added in excess (0.85 ml) to the bright yellow enzyme/FMN mixture to reduce completely the flavin giving a pale yellow solution. Finally, the (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP was added to generate the purple semiquinone flavin radical. After 7.5 min, methanol (19 ml) was added to precipitate the enzyme. The suspension was transferred to a capped centrifuge tube, and the tube was removed from the glove box before being centrifuged (17,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). All solutions were subsequently handled with exposure to air. The first supernatant (26 ml) was removed and retained. It became yellow on exposure to air. The purple pellet was dissolved in a fresh urea solution (8 m, 9.5 ml) with vigorous agitation to give a yellow solution. The addition of methanol (19 ml) gave a precipitate that gave a white pellet and a second yellow supernatant (27 ml) after centrifugation. The first and second supernatants were subjected to FPLC, and the product-containing fractions from both supernatants were pooled and exhaustively freeze-dried to give an off-white solid. A MonoQ HR10/10 FPLC column was used for preparative and analytical separations. Compounds were eluted with a 0–1 m, pH 7.7, ammonium bicarbonate gradient at a flow rate of 5 ml min−1 and monitored by absorbance at 256 nm as follows: shikimate (100 mm ammonium bicarbonate), shikimate 3-phosphate (325 mm), EPSP (500 mm), chorismate (410 mm), (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP (540 mm), FMN (320 mm), ATP (350 mm), ADP (300 mm), and AMP (210 mm). Inorganic phosphate was determined using a modified molybdate/malachite green method (22Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Remack P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar) using Triton N-101 instead of Sterox detergent. UV-visible spectra were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard HP8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Spectra of anaerobic samples were obtained using cuvettes that were prepared and sealed in an anaerobic glove box. Kinetic measurements were initiated by adding the final component of reaction mixtures from a side arm fitted to the cuvette. NMR spectra were obtained using a JEOL JNM LA400 spectrometer. 1H spectra were obtained in2H2O at 5 °C with a 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propane sulfonate reference. Coupling constants (J) are in Hz. Chorismate was produced from (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP: δH (399.65 MHz, literature (23Copley S.D. Knowles J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 5008-5013Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar)) 6.56 (1H, broad s, 6-CH), 6.31 (1H, d,J 2,3 10.0, 2-CH), 5.96 (1H, dd,J 2,3 10.0, J3,4 2.4, 3-CH), 5.20 (1H, d, J E8,Z8 2.8, pro-E 8-CH), 4.90 (5-CH, partially obscured by HOD), 4.57 (1H, dJ E8,Z8 2.8, pro-Z 8-CH) and 4-CH obscured by HOD. COSY experiments confirmed the connectivities between the C2–3, 5–6 and 8–8 protons. 5-Deaza-FAD was converted to 5-deaza-FMN using Crotalus adamanteus phosphodiesterase I (24Spencer R. Fisher J. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Anaerobic assay mixtures contained chorismate synthase (between 54 and 245 milliunits), EPSP (50 μm), 5-deaza-FMN (between 20 and 50 μm), sodium dithionite (1 mm), and MOPS buffer. Reactions were started with the addition of either enzyme or substrate and incubated for between 2.5 and 10 min before HPLC analysis of chorismate using a SAX column as described previously (11Bornemann S. Ramjee M.K. Balasubramanian S. Abell C. Coggins J.R. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22811-22815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9907-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As reported previously (16Ramjee M.N. Balasubramanian S. Abell C. Coggins J.R. Davies G.M. Hawkes T.R. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3151-3153Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the addition of stoichiometric (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP (40 μm) to the dithionite-reduced holoenzyme with its FMN bound in the monoanionic form (Fig. 1 b) led to the formation of a neutral flavin semiquinone radical (λmax584 nm) that reached a maximum after about 4 min (Fig. 1 c). By using an extinction coefficient independently determined for a chorismate synthase-bound flavin semiquinone radical with similar spectroscopic properties (4,700m−1 cm−1(25Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), 93% of the enzyme was estimated to be in this form. The flavin radical decayed slowly to a reduced form after 20 h (Fig.1 d). This reduced flavin species exhibited a spectrum reminiscent of the enzyme-bound neutral form (26Macheroux P. Bornemann S. Ghisla S. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25850-25858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), rather than the monoanionic form. Subsequent exposure of the enzyme to air led to the rapid formation of a mixture of semiquinone and oxidized flavin (data not shown). Control experiments with the omission of either enzyme, flavin, substrate analogue, or dithionite gave no formation of flavin semiquinone. When chorismate synthase was added last to an UV assay mixture that contained (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP as well as EPSP, it was inhibited (Fig.2). The concentration that gave 50% inhibition (IC50) was about 250 μm. Since the reaction that occurs between (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP and the enzyme occurs on the minute time scale and the K mfor EPSP is 1.3 μm (21Ramjee M.K. Coggins J.R. Thorneley R.N.F. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), it is possible that EPSP out-competes the analogue when they are presented simultaneously to the enzyme. When the enzyme was preincubated in assay mixtures with (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP in the presence of reduced FMN for 5 min before the final addition of EPSP, the enzyme was inhibited more strongly (Fig. 3). In this case, the IC50 was 2 orders of magnitude lower at 0.5 μm. This result shows that the analogue is a more potent inhibitor after it has oxidized the flavoenzyme to the semiquinone form. When the preincubation time before the final addition of EPSP was extended to 2 h, the enzyme recovered full activity only when the (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP concentration was <1 μm. This indicated that the inhibition of the enzyme is not absolutely irreversible. However, at concentrations of >2.4 μm, the enzyme was fully inhibited for at least 14 h, suggesting that the decay of the inhibited form of the enzyme is extremely slow.Figure 3Inhibition of chorismate synthase after preincubation with (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP.(6R)-6-Fluoro-EPSP was added to assay mixtures containing enzyme (47 nm) and all assay components other than EPSP (50 mm), which was added last after 5 min preincubation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to identify whether (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP is consumed during the oxidation of the flavin and inhibition of the enzyme, small scale reactions were set up where the substrate analogue was added last to a mixture containing enzyme and dithionite-reduced FMN. Since inhibition is essentially irreversible, the analogue, enzyme, and FMN were added stoichiometrically (200 μm). HPLC and FPLC analyses of these reactions, where the mixtures were injected directly onto the columns after incubation between 5 and 60 min, showed that the analogue was completely consumed in each case. A single new peak appeared in each with a retention time similar to that of chorismate but not of shikimate 3-phosphate. This suggested that the substrate analogue had lost its phosphate group but not its enolpyruvyl side chain. When the reaction mixtures were incubated for longer periods of up to 8 h, the product appeared to have become partially decomposed, giving several new breakdown products. No conversion of the analogue was observed in control experiments where either enzyme, flavin, substrate analogue or dithionite was omitted. Therefore, chorismate was only formed under conditions where the flavin semiquinone was formed. When similar reactions using photoreduced-FMN, rather than dithionite-reduced FMN, were analyzed by HPLC, several peaks was obtained. Although some of the chorismate-like compound was observed, there were substantial amounts of starting material left as well as a new peak with an unusually long retention time and other minor peaks. The characterization of the main product required a larger scale reaction and a purification protocol that allowed its isolation from the other components of the reaction mixture. Moreover, the product required removal from an enzyme complex with denaturants. Given the essentially quantitative conversion of the analogue to a single chorismate-like product in the presence of dithionite, this system was chosen for scale up. Trial experiments involving the denaturation and precipitation of the enzyme using either trichloroacetic acid or HClO4, followed by neutralization with either sodium hydrogen carbonate or potassium acetate, appeared to remove the protein successfully. However, the product of the reaction was not stable to acidic treatments. The observation that the enzyme precipitated in 67% methanol provided the key step to a milder protocol. After 7.5 min incubation of a complete reaction mixture on a large scale (200 μm; 1.9 μmol; 75 mg of protein), the intense purple color of the flavin semiquinone radical was fully formed. The anaerobic addition of methanol allowed the isolation of a purple enzyme complex by centrifugation, giving a supernatant that was pale yellow until exposure to air, when it became bright yellow. The pellet dissolved in 8 m urea with vigorous agitation to give a bright yellow solution on exposure to air. The addition of methanol once again allowed the isolation of the protein giving a second bright yellow supernatant and a white protein pellet. Visible spectroscopy of the first and second air-exposed supernatants gave normal oxidized FMN spectra with yields of 55 and 40%, respectively, with no indication of other FMN-derived species. Both supernatants were subjected to FPLC (Fig.4). The performance of the MonoQ column was not affected by the methanol. Furthermore, the presence of uncharged urea, unlike guanidine, did not preclude its use either. Only a small amount of starting material, present solely in the first supernatant, was left unreacted. The majority of the substrate analogue was converted to the single chorismate-like product that was present in both supernatants. UV-visible spectroscopy of the main product-containing fraction from the second supernatant gave a spectrum with an absorbance maximum at about 276 nm with a trough at about 256 nm. A similar spectrum was obtained with the first supernatant. Both spectra are similar to those of chorismate (λmax 274 nm (27Gibson F. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) indicating that the product was most probably a diene rather than an allylic, aliphatic, or aromatic compound. The product-containing fractions from both supernatants were combined and exhaustively freeze-dried to give an off-white solid. The purified product exhibited no detectable 31P (between 60 and −65 ppm) or 19F (between −150 and −210 ppm) NMR spectra, indicating that both phosphate and fluorine were eliminated from the substrate analogue. The 1H NMR spectrum of the product gave dominant resonances in the sp 2carbon region that were identical to those of chorismate (Fig.5). Further confirmation that the product was chorismate came from COSY experiments that showed connections between the C2–3, C5–6, and C8–8 resonances. The isolated yield of chorismate from the first and second supernatants was estimated to be about 40 and 25%, respectively, from its UV spectrum (ε275 = 2630 m−1cm−1) and by comparison of the areas under the FPLC peaks. Therefore, chorismate was the product of the reaction. Additional complex and overlapping signals were also observed in the aliphatic sp 3 region of the 1H NMR spectrum (3.6–1.7 ppm) that bore no resemblance to either shikimate derivatives or other components of the experimental system. Since chorismate was the only product of the reaction according to HPLC and FPLC and its final concentration in the final sample was low (theoretical maximum of 0.6 mg ml−1), it is likely that impurities such as plasticizers could be responsible for these peaks. Over a period of days at 5 °C, new signals were observed that were indicative of the aromatization of chorismate by oxidative 4,5-dehydrogenation (δH 8.44 (1H, s), 7.69 (1H, d, J 7.5 Hz) and 6.63 (1H, d, J 7.5 Hz)). Over this time scale, the aliphatic peaks did not change. It was not possible to detect the release of inorganic phosphate in either of the supernatants from the large scale experiment due to the high background level of phosphate originating primarily from the enzyme preparation. Similar small scale experiments using enzyme that was exhaustively dialyzed with MOPS buffer containing 50 mmK2SO4 allowed the detection of inorganic phosphate in 52 and 13% yields in the first and second supernatants, respectively. The low yield in the second supernatant may have reflected a greater difficulty of denaturing the complex on the small scale with urea. The recovery of FMN from such small scale experiments was similarly lower than expected. In any case, the net formation of at least 65% inorganic phosphate is entirely consistent with the analogue forming chorismate as the main product. It has previously been shown that (6S)-6-fluoro-EPSP is slowly but quantitatively converted to 6-fluoro-chorismate by chorismate synthase under steady-state conditions whether the flavoholoenzyme is reduced by dithionite or by photoirradiation before the addition of the substrate analogue (11Bornemann S.

We now report that the enzyme forms a transient semiquinone flavin radical during multiple turnover experiments in the presence of dithionite- but not photo-reduced flavin. The transient formation of a neutral reduced flavin is observed during turnover of the normal substrate (17Bornemann S. Balasubramanian S. Coggins J.R. Abell C. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem.

Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22811-22815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the addition of an 18-fold excess of (6S)-6-fluoro-EPSP to the enzyme-bound monoanionic dithionite-reduced FMN (Fig.6 b), the enzyme-bound neutral reduced FMN species (Δλmax 386 nm, Fig. 6 c) was rapidly formed within 15 s (Fig.7, circles). It was estimated that about 90% of the active sites were converted to this form (ε386 ∼6000 m−1cm−1 (11Bornemann S. Ramjee M.K. Balasubramanian S. Abell C. Coggins J.R. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9907-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). Unusually, a little semiquinone radical had also formed within 15 s, which accounted for the remaining 10% of the active sites. The amount of the radical increased to a maximum of 44% (ε ∼5200m−1 cm−1(25Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) after 3 min and remained at the same concentration during the remainder of the period of turnover (Fig. 6 d and Fig. 7,squares). This neutral semiquinone radical absorbs at longer wavelengths (λmax ∼606 nm,Fig. 6 d) than that formed with (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP (λmax 584 nm, Fig. 1 c). Since the extinction coefficients of both the neutral reduced flavin and this form of the radical are very similar at 386 nm (12Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9907-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the absorbance at this wavelength changed little as about half of the former was converted to the latter (Fig. 7,circles). Both of these flavin forms decayed after about 7 min (Fig. 7), when the substrate was exhausted, to give the monoanionic reduced flavin spectrum again (data not shown but similar to Fig.6 b). Similar results were obtained when the initial concentration of the substrate analogue was lower. However, with fewer than 5 turnovers, proportionately less semiquinone radical was formed from the neutral reduced flavin such that it accounted for less than 2% of the active sites during a single turnover. By contrast, when the flavin was photoreduced before the addition of the analogue, all of the active sites transiently formed the neutral reduced flavin form only, whatever the analogue concentration. Furthermore, with more than 5 turnovers, they were completed within half the time observed with dithionite-reduced flavin on basis of the longevity of the spectral changes. It is therefore clear that dithionite is somehow involved in the formation of the semiquinone in half of the active sites during turnover with this analogue and that the semiquinone form of the enzyme is not catalytically active. Reconstitution of the enzyme with 1,5-dihydro-5-deaza-FMN gave 0.2 ± 0.1% the activity determined with reduced FMN. Control assays without any added flavin gave 0.3 ± 0.2% the activity and those without any enzyme gave none. This suggests that the purified recombinant E. coli apoenzyme contains 0.3% holoenzyme and exhibits <0.3% activity when reconstituted with 5-deaza-FMN. Similar results were obtained with 1,5-dihydro-5-deaza-FAD, where reduced FAD-reconstituted enzyme gave 70% the activity of the reduced FMN-containing holoenzyme. The holoenzyme content could not be lowered using either gel filtration or dialysis. This paper describes three pieces of experimental evidence for the radical mechanism in the chorismate synthase reaction (SchemeFS1 A) as follows: the formation of chorismate from (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP, the interception by dithionite of the turnover of (6S)-6-fluoro-EPSP, and the lack of activity of the E. coli enzyme with 5-deaza-FMN. Each is discussed in turn below. It is clear that the major product of the reaction between (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP and the dithionite-reduced holoenzyme was chorismate, according to HPLC, FPLC, and both NMR and UV spectroscopies. This unexpected reaction must therefore involve the loss of phosphate, which was detected as inorganic phosphate, and fluoride. Chorismate was produced from the analogue only under conditions where the flavin semiquinone was formed, strongly indicating the involvement of radical chemistry in this transformation. The most likely mechanism for this chemistry is shown in Scheme FS2. Once a ternary complex is formed between the reduced holoenzyme and the analogue, a single electron is transferred from the low potential flavin to the analogue. This promotes the elimination of the phosphate group to generate an allylic radical. This intermediate is incapable of transferring an electron and proton to the flavin from the 6R position due to its (6R)-fluoro group. The longevity and solvent exposure of this potentially reactive allylic intermediate appears to be sufficient to allow its one electron reduction by dithionite. The resulting allylic anion would then undergo facile fluoride elimination to generate chorismate as the final product. Although the flavin semiquinone appears to be protected by the enzyme, it too is eventually reduced by dithionite. Since it is very difficult to conceive of a mechanism for this transformation that does not involve the initial electron transfer from the flavin to the substrate analogue, it can be concluded that this result provides strong evidence for such an initial step during normal catalysis. When (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP reacts with the photoreduced holoenzyme, chorismate is one of several products formed according to HPLC. It would therefore appear that in the absence of the one electron reductant dithionite, the reactive allylic radical formed from this analogue breaks down in several different ways. This is consistent with the more complicated spectral changes observed during the reaction under these conditions. Although only 50% of the active sites form the flavin semiquinone, an as yet unidentified species which absorbs at long wavelengths (λmax 650 nm) is also transiently formed (29Macheroux P. Bornemann S. Thorneley R.N.F. Stevenson K.J. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1996. University of Calgary Press, Calgary, Canada1997: 113-122Google Scholar). (6R)-6-Fluoro-EPSP is clearly a slow acting and essentially irreversible inhibitor of chorismate synthase giving IC50values of 0.5 and 250 μm, depending on whether the enzyme was preincubated with the analogue or not. There is no evidence for the covalent modification of the protein or the flavin. There is every indication that it is a stable enzyme complex, with flavin semiquinone, chorismate, and probably phosphate-bound, that is the inhibited form. These results therefore imply that the enzyme has a low affinity for (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP (∼250 μm) when in the reduced flavin form and a relatively high affinity for chorismate (<0.5 μm) when in the flavin semiquinone form. The enzyme is known to undergo a large conformational change after the sequential binding of oxidized flavin and then substrate (30Macheroux P. Schonbrunn E. Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Koch M.H.J. Bornemann S. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to know whether the inhibited complex has also undergone such a conformational change. The formation of the inhibited chorismate synthase complex is most probably the basis for the mode of action of the antibiotic (6R)-6-fluoroshikimate (31Davies G.M. Barrettbee K.J. Jude D.A. Lehan M. Nichols W.W. Pinder P.E. Thain J.L. Watkins W.J. Wilson R.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For comparison, the K i value for this analogue with the N. crassa enzyme is 3.0 μm (19Balasubramanian S. Davies G.M. Coggins J.R. Abell C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 8945-8946Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the monoanionic reduced flavin initially becomes protonated as normal in all of the active sites during multiple turnovers with (6S)-6-fluoro-EPSP, 50% of the flavin becomes transiently oxidized to a semiquinone in the presence of dithionite. This is best rationalized as the one-electron reduction of the corresponding allylic radical intermediate by dithionite, similar to that described above for (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP, in 50% of the active sites. Although electron and proton transfer between the radical intermediate and the flavin semiquinone would not be blocked by the (6S)-fluoro group, it would appear that the intermediate is sufficiently solvent-exposed and long lived for its reduction by dithionite in 50% of the active sites during multiple turnovers. The resulting allylic anion is very likely to eliminate fluoride leading to the formation of chorismate is this case also. The only product detected (>99%) in steady-state assay mixtures containing dithionite is 6-fluoro-chorismate (11Bornemann S. Ramjee M.K. Balasubramanian S. Abell C. Coggins J.R. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22811-22815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would appear that the active sites that undergo this chemistry are blocked with regard to the catalytic formation of chorismate, as is the case with (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP. During turnover of (6S)-6-fluoro-EPSP in the presence of photoreduced flavin, none of the flavin forms the semiquinone, and the total reaction time is halved. This is entirely consistent with the interception by dithionite of the allylic radical in 50% of the active sites and their subsequent dead-end inhibition, analogous to that with (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP. These results therefore provide additional support to the proposed radical mechanism of normal turnover. An intriguing feature of chorismate synthase is the divergent course of the chemistry at half of the active sites with substrate analogues under specific circumstances. These include the transient formation of ∼1:1 neutral reduced and semiquinone flavin with (6S)-6-fluoro-EPSP and dithionite as described above and the transient formation of ∼1:1 semiquinone and a species with long wavelength absorbance with (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP and photoreduced flavin (29Macheroux P. Bornemann S. Thorneley R.N.F. Stevenson K.J. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1996. University of Calgary Press, Calgary, Canada1997: 113-122Google Scholar). Another feature of the reaction with (6R)-6-fluoro-EPSP and dithionite-reduced flavin is the release of about 50% of the flavin, chorismate, and phosphate from the enzyme complex on precipitation with methanol. Given the fact that 100% of the enzyme was in the semiquinone form prior to the treatment with solvent, it is likely that the methanol directly promoted the release of these ligands. Nevertheless, only 50% of the active sites were sensitive to this treatment. Although these results suggest some sort of cooperativity of the tetrameric enzyme, there is no evidence of it with the normal substrate. Although it is difficult to rationalize these phenomena without detailed structural information, it implies asymmetry within the enzyme tetramer. The flavin semiquinones formed with the two fluorinated substrate analogues have different absorbance spectra and different rates of reduction by dithionite. The existence of two spectrally distinct neutral flavin semiquinones with chorismate synthase has been documented previously (25Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the semiquinone with absorbance at longer visible wavelengths probably experiences a more hydrophobic environment (32Müller F. Brüstlein M. Hemmerich P. Massey V. Walker W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is still not clear what causes the environment, reactivity, and spectroscopic properties of the flavin semiquinones to be different. The lack of activity with 1,5-dihydro-5-deaza-FMN described here strongly indicates the involvement of flavin in catalysis by theE. coli enzyme (33Hemmerich P. Massey V. Fenner H. FEBS Lett. 1977; 84: 5-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A similar result has previously been reported for the bifunctional N. crassa enzyme (15Lauhon C.T. Bartlett P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14100-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which possesses an additional NADPH:FMN oxidoreductase activity (3Welch G.R. Cole K.W. Gaertner F.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The possibility that the flavin analogue does not bind to the E. coli enzyme can be ruled out because it has been shown to do so in both its oxidized and reduced forms in the presence of EPSP (26Macheroux P. Bornemann S. Ghisla S. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25850-25858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The lack of activity of the enzyme with reduced 5-deaza-FMN provides additional support for the proposed radical mechanism. This paper provides strong evidence for the radical mechanism in the conversion of EPSP to chorismate by chorismate synthase. A key question is how the enzyme substantially lowers the reduction potential of the FMN in order to allow this unusual chemistry to occur in a controlled way, particularly when model electrochemical systems indicate decarboxylation, rather than phosphate elimination, is possible (34Theoclitou M.E. Duggan P.J. Abell C. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 1285-1288Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of this enzyme should provide further information about how this radical chemistry is achieved. We thank Prof. Sandro Ghisla for the 5-deaza-FAD, Prof. John R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), demonstrate that the number of phosphorylated FcεRI and their lifetime is influenced both by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. In RBL-2H3 cells, a widely used line of rat mast cells, the aggregation-induced phosphorylation of FcεRI is mediated by p53/56 lyn (6Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases; the identity of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) (PTP) responsible for dephosphorylating the IgE receptors remains uncertain. Alternative, although not mutually exclusive, mechanisms, by which the formation of receptor aggregates promotes phosphorylation of FcεRI, have been proposed. One model posits that aggregates that include at least one IgE receptor constitutively associated with a molecule of the kinase enable a “transphosphorylation” of the juxtaposed receptors (7Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It proposes that the constitutive protein:protein interaction between the kinase and the receptor are essential regardless of where in the membrane they occur. A second model proposes that aggregation drives receptors into specialized regions of the membrane, variously called lipid rafts or detergent-resistant membranes (DRM), which are enriched in the initiating kinase (8Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 9Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 82: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Exposure to the high local concentrations of Lyn is thought sufficient to account for the phosphorylation of the immigrant receptors. How PTP fit into these models remains unclear. It has been suggested that in T-cells some PTP, notably the transmembrane PTP, CD45, are excluded from DRM (11Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In the latter instance, however, this was thought to lead to decreased activity of Src family kinases within the DRM, rather than to prolong the phosphorylation of resident proteins. In another instance, evidence was presented that phosphoproteins corralled in DRM by co-aggregation of CD3 and CD28 on T cells remained phosphorylated longer than those not so confined (12Viola A. Schroeder S. Sakakibara Y. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1999; 283: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Prior studies by our group showed that FcεRI, presumptively located within DRM, were nevertheless rapidly dephosphorylated when the kinase was inhibited (5Mao S.-Y. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). That result argued against protection from PTP within these domains, but alternative interpretations of those data are possible. Our laboratory has presented evidence that a “kinetic proof-reading” regimen (13Hopfield J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 14McKeithan T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5042-5046Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) governs the capacity of aggregates of FcεRI of varying stability to initiate downstream signals (15Torigoe C. Inman J.K. Metzger H. Science. 1998; 281: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In such a regimen, the likelihood that downstream signals are propagated depends not only on the concentration but also on the lifetime of the “activated” receptor. Therefore, the notion that rafts would protect phosphoproteins from deactivation by phosphatases raises the possibility that the domains not only increase the intensity of the signals but also their potential to stimulate later, “downstream,” events. We have now explored this possibility in greater detail. Specifically, we examined the distribution of PTP activity in cellular compartments fractionated on sucrose gradients to assess the level of PTP activity in DRM directly. In addition, we compared the distribution of the initiating kinase Lyn and of SHP-1, a PTP mooted as a potential negative regulator of the IgE receptor (16Kimura T. Zhang J. Sagawa K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4426-4434PubMed Google Scholar). We also examined a protein constitutively associated with the rafts, the linker foractivation of T cells (LAT) (17Stephan V. Seibt A. Körholz D. Wahn V. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 18Lin J. Weiss A. Finco T.S. J. Biol.

A biotin moiety was attached to the N-terminal lysine, and phosphotyrosines were substituted for the canonical tyrosines at positions 47 and 58. Covalent oligomers of mouse IgE were prepared as described (25Fewtrell C. Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 701-710PubMed Google Scholar); the RBL cells used were from clone RBL-2H3 (26Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Performing all procedures at 0–4 °C, 6–8 × 107 RBL cells were suspended at 2 × 107/ml in buffer A described by Smart et al. (27Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, all at 10 μg/ml), and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl- fluoride and sonicated with a microtip probe (Ultrasonic Processor XL; Heat Systems, Farmingdale, NY) for 5 s, at maximum power. This sonicate was centrifuged at 800 × g, for 10 min, to get a post-nuclear supernatant (PNS). A portion of the latter was then centrifuged in a 70Ti fixed angle rotor (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) at 100,000 × g, for 60 min. The supernatant of the latter centrifugation is referred to as “cytosol”; the pellet as “crude membrane.” Our method followed closely that of Smartet al. (27Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). A PNS was prepared as above from 0.5–1 × 108 RBL cells, except that a second sonication of the initial pellet was performed and the supernatant added to the initial PNS. Two-ml aliquots of this pooled supernatant containing approximately 3–4 × 107 cell eq were layered on top of a 23-ml cushion of 30% Percoll and centrifuged for 30 min, at 84,000 × g. The fractions containing a visible band (fractions 8–13) were pooled. They typically contained 70–90% of the radioactive IgE, but only 20–30% of the total protein. After addition of some diluent, the plasma membrane fractions were concentrated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The loose pellet was aspirated with a Pasteur pipette in approximately 0.5 ml, 0.8 ml TNE buffer (see below) was added, and the solution was made 0.1% in Triton X-100. After 40 min, the solution was centrifuged on a step gradient of sucrose as described below with the omission of orthovanadate and iodoacetate from all buffers. An aliquot of the unfractionated Triton X-100 extract and of the PNS was retained for use in the PTP assay and protein analysis. We prepared lipid rafts using the method described by Rodgers and Rose (11Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In short, 1–2 × 107 adherent RBL cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of a buffer containing 0.1% (≈1.6 mm) Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm sodium iodoacetate and protease inhibitors as described above (TNEV). (In experiments to assess PTP activity, the vanadate and iodoacetate were omitted (TNE buffer).) At these concentrations, the value of ρ (= ([detergent] − cmceff)/[phospholipid]) is ≈2–3 (28Rivnay B. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12800-12808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The suspension was then transferred to a Dounce homogenizer and subjected to 15 strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant mixed in an Ultra-clear™ centrifuge tube (Beckman) with an equal volume of 85% sucrose made up in water. This mixture was successively overlaid with 6 ml of 30% sucrose and 3.5 ml of 5% sucrose, neither of which contained Triton X-100. The tubes were then centrifuged at 200,000 × gat 4 °C, in a Beckman SW40Ti rotor for either 4 or 16 h. Sequential 1-ml fractions were harvested from the top of the gradient. An opaque band at the interface between the 5% and 30% layers was routinely harvested in fraction 4 and contained the lipid rafts. All fractions were counted in a γ counter, and aliquots were analyzed by the bicinchoninic acid method for total protein (29Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18702) Google Scholar) with reagents from Pierce, and by Western blotting for specific proteins that had been separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in SDS, as described previously (30Alber G. Kent U.M. Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2428-2436PubMed Google Scholar). Sucrose fractions were diluted with TNEV so that the final concentration of sucrose was approximately 15% in all cases. Triton X-100 was added to give a final concentration of 0.2% in all fractions. Anti-IgE (2 μg/ml) and a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl/ml) were added to each tube and incubated overnight or for 4 h. In a few instances, the time for immunoprecipitations was reduced by incubating the protein A-Sepharose beads with goat anti-mouse IgE for 4 h, at 4 °C, washing them, and then adding them to the fractions from the sucrose gradient. Aliquots (0.6 ml) of diluted cell extracts or of fractions from sucrose gradients were adjusted to contain 2 mmdithiothreitol and 0.5% Triton X-100. They were warmed to 37 °C, and either the nonspecific or specific biotinylated phosphopeptide substrate (above) was added to a final concentration of 294 nm. Duplicate samples were removed after 1 min to 18 h., and assayed for residual phosphotyrosine with a tyrosine phosphatase assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; catalog no. 1 534 153) using the instructions provided. Briefly, 34-μl aliquots (10 pmol of substrate) were added to the wells of a streptavidin-coated, 96-well microtiter plate containing 16 μl of 0.1 morthovanadate to quench the reaction. For any given sample, at least four time points were taken. Duplicate standards, prepared in the same buffer used for the test samples and comprising sequential 2-fold dilutions containing between 10 and 0.01 pmol of the substrate peptide, were added to the same microtiter plate. We observed no effect on peptide binding to the plate even at concentrations of up to 40% sucrose, a concentration higher than any present in the assays on the gradient fractions. After the biotinylated substrate had been allowed to bind for at least 1 h at room temperature, the wells were washed and HRP-conjugated monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10-HRP) was added. After 1 h at 37 °C, the wells were washed and a chromogenic substrate for HRP (ABTS®) was added. Ten minutes later, the absorbance at 405 nm was read on a MR5000 plate reader (Dynatech). Our standard curve data consistently showed a linear relationship between absorbance and the amount of substrate added between 0.01 and 0.3 pmol/well and was convincingly able to detect 2-fold differences in PTP activity as assessed by sequential dilutions of whole cell extracts. Adherent cells (≈2 × 106/well) sensitized with anti-DNP IgE were rinsed three times with activation buffer and then incubated at 37 °C with or without antigen (0.3 μg/ml DNP25–30-HSA). After 4 min, the cells were either solubilized immediately in 0.5% Triton X-100 or first reacted with 100 μm DNP-caproate for 10–80 s. Lysates from four replicate wells were pooled and duplicate aliquots prepared. Octylglucoside (final concentration, 60 mm) was added to one set of lysates. After solubilization (30 min at 4 °C), lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and aliquots removed for later analysis. LAT was immunoprecipitated from the lysates containing octylglucoside; IgE-bound FcεRI were immunoprecipitated from corresponding lysates prepared in the absence of octylglucoside, using an affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgE. After overnight incubations, the beads were washed three times with ice-cold solubilization buffer and reacted with an approximately equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and placed in a boiling water bath for a few minutes. Likewise, whole cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and heated. All samples were separated by electrophoresis on 12% Tris-glycine gels. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and the latter incubated overnight in a Tris buffer containing 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% Tween detergent. The membranes were blotted with biotin-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine and then with avidin-conjugated HRP. The bound enzyme was quantitated using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and autophotographs scanned on a computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Previous studies of the RBL-2H3 mast cell line demonstrated that when detergent lysates are subjected to centrifugation on sucrose density gradients, unaggregated FcεRI localize to the lower (denser) fractions containing Triton X-soluble proteins from the cytoplasm and membranes, whereas aggregates of the receptors accumulated in the more buoyant fractions containing the Triton X-100 DRM or “lipid rafts” (8Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 9Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We were readily able to reproduce these findings. Adherent RBL-2H3 cells were passively sensitized with 125I-labeled mouse anti-DNP IgE (or covalent oligomers of IgE), and then challenged or not with DNP25–30-HSA. In resting cells only a small fraction of the recovered radioactivity, generally 2–4%, was associated with the Triton X-100-resistant lipid rafts. Following challenge with antigen, 10–50% of the counts were recovered in the fractions containing the lipid rafts. In three successive experiments in which antigen increased the percent of receptors in the DRM by an average of 29%, the increase was reversed to just over 2% by subsequent addition of hapten. This demonstrates that the ligand-induced aggregation of the receptors must be maintained in order for the association with the rafts to persist. Although smaller aggregates of receptors translocated into the DRM, their association was weaker than that exhibited by larger aggregates. Thus as shown in the results of a comparative study in TableI, dimers of IgE remained largely in the denser gradient fractions when the Triton X-100 concentration was increased to 0.2%, whereas the larger covalent aggregates or aggregates induced by the multivalent antigen continued to float in the fractions containing the DRM.Table ITranslocation of aggregated FcɛRI to Triton X-100-resistant domainsStimulusConcentration of Triton X-1000.1%0.2%Ag 1-aAg, antigen.DimerTrimerOligomerNoneAgDimerTrimerOligomerμg/ml0.30.50.751.00.30.50.751.0Time (min)430303044303030% cpmDRM182532302.4275.33.67.8Soluble6659505295599295911-a Ag, antigen. Open table in a new tab In addition to FcεRI, we examined the distribution of several plasma membrane proteins previously reported to reside within lipid rafts (Fig. 1). The Src family kinase, Lyn, the glycosylphosphoinositide-tethered protein, Thy 1, and LAT (17Stephan V. Seibt A. Körholz D. Wahn V. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) each resided predominantly and constitutively within Triton X-100-resistant lipid rafts as had been described (18Lin J. Weiss A. Finco T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28861-28864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Syk kinase and SHP-1 were virtually absent from the fractions containing the lipid rafts as expected, given their predominantly cytosolic location. Unlike the IgE receptor (Table I), neither those two enzymes nor any other proteins we observed migrated to the DRM in response to antigen-induced aggregation of FcεRI as judged by this assay (Fig. 1). It has been proposed that the preferential localization of the initiating Lyn kinase within lipid rafts makes these domains favored sites at which the β and γ chains of FcεRI become phosphorylated after the receptors are aggregated (9Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility further, we measured the phosphotyrosine content of antigen-aggregated FcεRI recovered from the different portions of the gradient. Appropriately pooled fractions were incubated with anti-IgE, and the protein-bound phosphotyrosine on the immunoprecipitated FcεRI was quantitated by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. Using this methodology, it appeared that only those receptors in the lipid rafts were detectably tyrosine-phosphorylated, as has been reported (9Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, upper blot(with anti-PY)). Notably, when the same immunoprecipitates were re-probed with an antibody to the β chain of FcεRI, the subunit was virtually undetectable in the fractions from the denser part of the gradient which contain the Triton X-100-soluble proteins, even though the IgE in those fractions had been efficiently precipitated (Fig. 2,lower blot (with anti-β)). When unstimulated cells were similarly analyzed, we observed that, likewise, over 75% of the receptors had dissociated during the gradient centrifugation of the detergent extracts (data not shown). Whereas in mild detergent IgE remains stably bound to the α chain, the β and γ subunits of FcεRI dissociate from the α chain unless adequate lipids are present (28Rivnay B. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12800-12808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rivnay B. Wank S.A. Poy G. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6922-6927Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Kinet J.-P. Alcaraz G. Leonard A. Wank S.A. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4117-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Under the conditions we used for solubilization, ρ, which is a function of the detergent:lipid concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”) was in the range where the FcεRI is relatively stable. Therefore, it appeared that the centrifugation was depleting the denser part of the gradient of lipid and thereby inducing dissociation of the receptors in those fractions. Addition of ethanol to these fractions precipitated most of the β and γ subunits that had dissociated from the α-IgE complexes retained in those fractions (data not shown). Because the disruption of the receptors is gradual (32Kinet J.-P. Alcaraz G. Leonard A. Wank S.A. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4117-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we sought to minimize the time of centrifugation, and found that 4 h were sufficient to separate the low density, Triton X-100-resistant fraction (Fig. 3). The profile of total proteins from similar fractions of a gradient prepared in parallel, but centrifuged for 16 or 4 h alternatively, were also virtually indistinguishable (data not shown). Even with the more rapid isolation procedure, the amount of β chain associated with the IgE-bound α chain was on average 5-fold less (range, 2–10-fold) in anti-IgE immunoprecipitates from the denser fractions than in immunoprecipitates from the fractions containing the DRM (TableII, 6th column of data). Shortening the time of the immunoprecipitation did not substantially further improve the relative yield (data not shown).Table IIDistribution of intact and phosphorylated receptors in gradientsFraction 4 (Triton X-resistant)Fraction 12 (Triton X-soluble)Fraction 4/fraction 12PY/ββ/IgEPY/ββ/IgEPY/ββ/IgEAverage“1.00”“1.00”0.160.235.175.42S.E.0.570.240.0420.0671.051.20 Open table in a new tab With the more rapid fractionation, we recovered sufficient intact receptors from the critical fractions to determine their content of phosphotyrosine reliably. The receptors located in the denser fraction (fraction 12) contained substantial tyrosine-phosphorylated FcεRI. However, in the nine experiments summarized in Table II, the receptors that had translocated to the lipid rafts after aggregation contained on average 5-fold more phosphotyrosine per β subunit (range, 2–13-fold), (Table II, 5th column of data). We investigated the distribution of PTP activity within RBL-2H3 cells. We were particularly interested in gauging the localization of PTP activity capable of dephosphorylating the subunits of the IgE receptor itself. To this, end we prepared a bis-phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the ITAM sequence of the γ chain of FcεRI (33Reth M.

A tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide derived from human gastrin served as a control, nonspecific substrate in parallel assays.Table IIIDistribution of specific and nonspecific phosphatase activity in discrete cellular compartmentsFractionSubstrate peptideAverage (ITAM/nonspecific)ITAMNonspecificnAverageS.E.PNSnAverageS.E.PNS%%Post-nuclear supernatant78.422.52100780.820.321000.104Cytosol91.240.2715928.95.42360.043Total membrane97.231.8986957.69.95710.126Plasma membrane62.980.4635626.14.49320.1 Open table in a new tab The sum of the activities measured in the crude membrane and cytosol agreed well with the activity measured in the unfractionated post-nuclear supernatant. As documented in Table III, PTP activity toward the ITAM substrate was 10–20-fold lower than that detected in the same fractions toward the nonspecific peptide. A significant majority of the PTP activity against both substrates was located in the crude membrane fraction of RBL cells consistent with previously reported data (5Mao S.-Y. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Table III also shows that the activity toward the ITAM relative to that toward nonspecific peptide was highest in the plasma membrane and lowest in the cytosolic fraction. It was of interest to examine the presence of PTP activity within detergent-resistant lipid rafts, specifically. We prepared sucrose gradients of whole cell extracts identical to those used in the analyses above. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity, as well as the content of total protein and Lyn kinase, was then assessed for each gradient fraction and compared with the unfractionated whole cell extract. The sum of PTP activity, total protein (data not shown), and Lyn kinase detected in individual gradient fractions accounted almost exactly for the values measured in the unseparated cell extract.

Ba2+ block involves an interaction with the same residues. guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio) triphosphate Rectification of the constitutively active classical inward-rectifying K+ channels, such as Kir2.1, has been extensively studied and much is known about the underlying mechanisms. However, rectification of the cardiac muscarinic K+ channel (Kir3.1/Kir3.4) is less understood. Rectification of Kir2.1 is due to intracellular block of the channel pore at potentials positive to the K+ equilibrium potential, E K, by intracellular Mg2+ and positively charged aliphatic amines, such as spermine, spermidine, and putrescine (polyamines) (1Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 2Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Henley C.M. Brown A.M.

Cell. 1995; 80: 149-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Upon hyperpolarization to potentials negative to E K, current through Kir2.1 activates via instantaneous and time-dependent (time constant, <10 ms) phases. These components are thought to reflect rapid unblock of the channel by Mg2+ and putrescine followed by a slower unblock by spermine and spermidine (2Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Henley C.M. Brown A.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1068-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 4Shyng S.L. Sha Q. Ferrigni T. Lopatin A.N. Nichols C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12014-12019Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Kinetically, activation of Kir3.1/Kir3.4 is different. On hyperpolarization, again an instantaneous activation of current is observed followed by a time-dependent phase, but in this case the time-dependent phase is best described by a double exponential function with time constants of tens and hundreds of milliseconds (5Simmons M.A. Hartzell H.C. Pflügers Arch. 1987; 409: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, whereas the time constant of activation of Kir2.1 shows steep voltage dependence (6Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. 1985; 366: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), that of Kir3.1/Kir3.4 is only weakly voltage-dependent (7Doupnik C.A. Lim N.F. Kofuji P. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The slow component of activation is only observed in heteromultimeric Kir3 channels containing the subunit Kir3.1 (such as the cardiac muscarinic K+ channel, which is a heterotetramer of two Kir3.1 and two Kir3.4 subunits (Refs. 8Krapivinsky G.

Doring F. Spauschus A. Thomzig A. Veh R. Karschin A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 194-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The difference in kinetics between Kir2.1 and Kir3.1/Kir3.4 has been suggested to be the result of an intrinsic gating mechanism in Kir3.1/Kir3.4 (11Pessia M. Bond C.T. Kavanaugh M.P. Adelman J.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1039-1045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Dascal N. Doupnik C.A. Ivanina T. Bausch S. Wang W. Lin C. Garvey J. Chavkin C. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc.

Physiol. 1996; 490: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), possibly involving the C terminus of Kir3.1 in a manner analogous to N-type inactivation of voltage-gated K+ channels (14Lim N.F. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Luchian T. Dascal N. Dessauer C. Platzer D. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Schreibmayer W. J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this case, slow activation would involve the slow unblock of the pore of the channel by the C terminus of Kir3.1. However, the time-dependent activation of Kir3.1/Kir3.4, even though it is approximately 2 orders of magnitude slower than that of Kir2.1, may also be the result of the unblock of the channel by polyamines. Upon depolarization, there is a time-dependent decay (or “relaxation”) of the cardiac muscarinic K+ current. In inside-out patches from rabbit atrial cells, this relaxation has been shown to be the result of block by intracellular polyamines (16Yamada M. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9289-9294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). If slow activation on hyperpolarization is the converse of the decay on depolarization (as has been suggested by Simmons and Hartzell (Ref. 5Simmons M.A. Hartzell H.C. Pflügers Arch. 1987; 409: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)), it follows that it is the result of dissociation of polyamines from the channel, rather than an additional intrinsic gating mechanism. One aim of this study was to test this. Block of the pore of Kir3.1/Kir3.4 by positively charged polyamines (or any other blocking particle, such as the C terminus of Kir3.1) could possibly be the result of an interaction with negatively charged residues within the pore of the channel. This is the case in Kir2.1 and mutation of two negatively charged residues in Kir2.1, Asp-172 and Glu-224, is known to reduce polyamine sensitivity and consequently reduce rectification (17Stanfield P.R. Davies N.W. Shelton P.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Khan I.A. Brammar W.J. Conley E.C. J. Physiol. 1994; 478: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Another aim was to seek equivalent residues in Kir3.1/Kir3.4. It is well known that inward-rectifying K+ channels, such as Kir3.1/Kir3.4, are blocked by Ba2+ and it is possible that this is also the result of interaction with negatively charged residues within the pore of the channel (19Zang W.J., Yu, X.J. Boyett M.R. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 430: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In Kir2.1, at least, there is an overlap between polyamine and Ba2+ interaction sites (20Shieh R.C. Chang J.C. Arreola J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2313-2322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The final aim of this study was to identify residues involved in Ba2+ block of Kir3.1/Kir3.4. Oocytes were injected with cRNA encoding wild-type or mutant Kir3.1 subunit, wild-type or mutant Kir3.4 subunit, and the hD2 receptor (the latter permits activation of the channel). When cRNA for a mutant subunit was injected, cRNA for the wild-type second subunit was injected (except in one case when cRNA for mutant forms of both subunits was injected). Site-directed mutations were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with oligonucleotides supplied by Sigma-Genosys (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Mutations were verified by fluorescent cycle sequencing using Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In vitro transcription of Kir 3.1, Kir 3.4, and hD2 cRNAs was performed using SP6 RNA polymerase (RiboMAX; Promega, Madison, WI). All cDNA templates were subcloned into a Xenopus high expression vector. Stock solutions of cRNA were diluted in nuclease-free water to give the appropriate concentrations prior to injection. Oocyte preparation, injection of RNA, and two-microelectrode voltage clamp recordings were performed as described previously (21Owen J.M. Quinn C.C. Leach R. Findlay J.B. Boyett M.R. Exp. Physiol. 1999; 84: 471-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The bath solution contained (in mm): KCl 90, HEPES 5, CaCl2 2, pH 7.4 (KOH). In some experiments the solution also contained 3 mmMgCl2; the absence or presence of MgCl2 did not affect the results obtained. Microelectrodes were filled with 3m KCl and were ∼1 megohm in resistance. In the majority of recordings, oocytes were held at 0 mV and 750-ms pulses were applied to potentials ranging between −130 and +40 mV. In some experiments on Kir3.1/Kir3.4, pulses were 1.5 s in duration, and, in experiments on Kir3.1/Kir3.4-N179D, pulses were 3 s in duration. Control oocytes were injected with nuclease-free water; recordings from oocytes showing significant endogenous currents were rejected. Giant patch experiments were carried out using the technique described by Hilgemann and Lu (22Hilgemann D.W. Lu C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The bath solution contained (in mm): KCl 96, NaCl 20, MgCl2 4.5, MgATP 2.5, EGTA 5, HEPES 10, pH 7.35 (KOH) (total free Mg2+, ∼5 mm). In some experiments the bath solution contained (in mm): KCl 90, HEPES 5, EDTA 5, pH 7.35 (KOH). To maintain channel activity in detached inside-out patches, 10 μmGTPγS1 was also included in the bath solution. Pipette solution contained (in mm): KCl 96, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1, dopamine 10 μm, ascorbic acid 1, HEPES 10, pH 7.35 (KOH). Pipettes had resistances between 90 and 200 kilohms; this allowed recording of currents of the order of 0.5–10 nA/patch. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. (number of oocytes). Data comparisons were made by one-way analysis of variance, unless stated, followed by comparisons with control data using Dunnett's test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant if p < 0.05. A typical recording of currents from an oocyte expressing wild-type Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 subunits is shown in Fig. 1 A. The recording illustrates the strong rectification of the channel with little outward current being present at potentials positive toE K (∼0 mV). The currents in response to hyperpolarizing pulses demonstrate the rapid and slow components of activation of the current. As a measure of the slow activation of the current, we have expressed the current developed after 50 ms of a pulse to −100 mV as a percentage of the steady-state current (at the end of the pulse). For the wild-type channel, this parameter was 83 ± 1% (n = 6).Figure 1Residues in the H5 region of Kir3.1 are involved in slow activation. A–D, currents recorded from oocytes expressing the wild-type (WT) channel (Kir3.1/Kir3.4) (A), Kir3.1-F137S/Kir3.4 (B), Kir3.1-E139Q/Kir3.4 (C), and Kir3.1-E141Q/Kir3.4 (D).

Data are fitted by the Boltzmann equation:g/g −130 = 1/(1 + exp(V − V 12/k)), whereV is the membrane potential, V 12 is the membrane potential at which g/g −130is half-maximum, and k is the slope factor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the mechanism underlying the slow activation, we mutated residues within the pore region of the channel that could potentially act as a binding site for a positively charged gating particle (see Introduction). First, the H5 pore region was targeted. Previously, Kofuji et al. (13Kofuji P. Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) identified the residue F137 in the H5 region of Kir3.1 as having an important effect on channel activation; the mutation Kir3.1-F137S abolished slow activation. However, Kofujiet al. (13Kofuji P. Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) expressed Kir3.1-F137S alone. This means the recordings were either made from homotetrameric channels or heterotetrameric Kir3.1-F137S/Kir3.5 channels (Kir3.5 is expressed at a low level endogenously in Xenopus oocytes (Ref. 23Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)). We expressed Kir3.1-F137S along with Kir3.4. This leads to enhanced currents compared with expression of Kir3.1-F137S alone; therefore, the majority of current recorded is likely to be from Kir3.1-F137S/Kir3.4 rather than homotetramers or Kir3.1-F137S/Kir3.5. Expression of Kir3.1-F137S and wild-type Kir3.4 resulted in currents with kinetics of activation comparable to those previously reported by Kofuji et al. (13Kofuji P. Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as illustrated in Fig. 1 B; current activated rapidly at the start of the pulse and then inactivated (the nature of the inactivation is considered under “Discussion”). Slow activation was, therefore, abolished. Current at 50 ms was 147 ± 4% (n = 5) of steady state. Phenylalanine (Phe), although neutral, can potentially act as a cation-binding site due to the presence of a cloud of delocalized electrons surrounding the aromatic ring of this residue. It is feasible, therefore, that mutation of this residue changes gating because it disrupts interaction with a positively charged gating particle. Other likely residues that could interact with a positively charged gating particle are negatively charged aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu) residues. Kir3.1/Kir3.4 contains eight glutamate residues within the H5 region of the channel, two per subunit, in two closely juxtaposed rings. The negatively charged glutamate residues were systematically mutated to neutral glutamine residues. Each mutation removes two negative charges from the channel (assuming a stoichiometry of two Kir3.1:two Kir3.4). Fig. 1 C shows currents from an oocyte expressing Kir3.1-E139Q (and wild-type Kir3.4). This novel mutation, like the mutation Kir3.1-F137S, abolished slow activation of the current; current at 50 ms was 141 ± 3% (n = 6) of steady state (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, Kir3.1-E139 is only two residues away from Kir3.1-E141, but the mutation Kir3.1-E141Q produced a current similar to that of the wild-type channel (Fig.1 D). The equivalent residues to Glu-139 and Glu-141 in Kir3.1 are Glu-145 and Glu-147 in Kir3.4. In a manner comparable to the mutations in Kir3.1, the mutation Kir3.4-E145Q abolished slow activation and the mutation Kir3.4-E147Q failed to alter slow activation. A summary of the activation properties of the wild-type and mutant channels is shown in Fig. 2; current at 50 ms during a pulse to −100 mV as a percentage of steady-state current is shown. In Kir2.1 two negatively charged residues have been implicated in polyamine binding, time-dependent activation on hyperpolarization and rectification: an aspartate residue in the M2 domain (Asp-172) and a glutamate residue in the C terminus (Glu-224) (17Stanfield P.R. Davies N.W. Shelton P.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Khan I.A. Brammar W.J. Conley E.C. J. Physiol. 1994; 478: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 24Wible B.A. Taglialatela M. Ficker E. Brown A.M.

Because Kir2.1 forms homomeric channels, there are four Asp-172 and four Glu-224 residues per channel. In Kir3.1/Kir3.4 there are only two negatively charged residues in the M2 region equivalent to Kir2.1-D172, because whereas Kir3.1 has an aspartate residue at the equivalent position (Kir3.1-D173), Kir3.4 has a neutral asparagine residue (Kir3.4-N179). In Kir3.1/Kir3.4 there are only two negatively charged residues in the C terminus equivalent to Kir2.1-E224, because whereas Kir3.4 has a glutamate residue at the equivalent position (Kir3.4-E231), Kir3.1 has a serine residue (Kir3.1-S225). These negatively charged residues in Kir3.1/Kir3.4 have been mutated to neutral residues. The effect of mutating Asp-173 of Kir3.1 to a neutral glutamine residue (Gln) is shown in the first column of Fig.3 A (upper traces show currents from wild-type channel for comparison). The mutation Kir3.1-D173Q abolished slow activation (current at 50 ms, 99 ± 0.3%, n = 6, of steady state; see also Fig.2), as did mutation to a neutral alanine residue (Kir3.1-D173A; Fig.2). It was not possible to obtain recordings after mutation of Kir3.1-D173 to a neutral asparagine residue (Asn), because of the absence of measurable currents. Interestingly, the mutation Kir3.1-D173S failed to produce a significant effect on gating kinetics (Fig. 2). This may be due to the polar nature of the serine (Ser) side chain (the side chain could potentially form an interaction site for a positively charged blocking particle). The mutation Kir3.4-E231Q produced channels with kinetic properties illustrated in the second column of Fig. 3 A; slow activation was reduced (current at 50 ms, 95 ± 1%, n = 6, of steady state; see also Fig. 2), but not as markedly as with many of the other mutations discussed above. With Kir2.1, mutation of Asp-172 and Glu-224 together reduces rectification, such that significant outward currents may be observed at potentials positive to E K (18Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). With Kir3.1/Kir3.4, the combination of the two analogous mutations (Kir3.1-D173Q/Kir3.4-E231Q) reduced slow activation as illustrated in the second column of Fig. 3 A (see also Fig. 2). However, the effects of the two mutations on slow activation were not additive, and the effect of the double mutation was no greater than that of Kir3.1-D173Q alone (Fig. 2; t test,p > 0.05). Furthermore, the double mutation did not reduce rectification (outward currents were still small; Fig.3 A). Direct sequence comparison may not identify equivalently positioned residues. There may be structural differences between Kir2.1, Kir3.1, and Kir3.4 such that other residues in Kir3.1 (or Kir3.4) may have a more prominent role than Kir3.4-E231. In Kir3.1, the nearest negatively charged residues by sequence alignment are Glu-198 and Asp-206. The mutation Kir3.1-E198Q produced a modest reduction in slow activation (Fig. 2); the effect was less marked than that of other mutations studied. Kir3.1-D206N failed to produce a significant alteration in gating kinetics (Fig. 2). Thus far, we have considered the effects on activation of removing negatively charged residues. As noted above, Kir2.1 has a ring of four negatively charged residues within the channel pore formed by Asp-172, whereas Kir3.1/Kir3.4 has only two negatively charged residues (Kir3.1-D173) at the equivalent position. By mutating the neutral asparagine residue, Asn-179, of Kir3.4 to an aspartate residue, the heteromultimer formed upon assembly with Kir3.1 will also have such a ring of four negatively charged residues at the equivalent position. Currents recorded from an oocyte expressing Kir3.4-N179D are shown in Fig. 3 B. Note the change in time scale from previous traces; a set of currents on the same time base from an oocyte expressing the wild-type channel is shown in Fig. 3 B for comparison. Addition of the extra negatively charged residue produced an enhancement of slow gating (current at 50 ms, 71 ± 1%,n = 6, of steady-state; see also Fig. 2). As shown by the summary in Fig. 2, mutations in the H5 region produced the largest alterations of slow activation, mutations in the M2 region the next largest changes, and mutations in the C terminus had the smallest effects. During the course of this study it was noted that the mutations Kir3.1-F137S and Kir3.1-E139Q altered the activation curve of Kir3.1/Kir3.4 as shown in Fig. 1 (E andF). Activation curves were constructed from data like that in Fig. 1 A by plotting conductance against membrane potential. Conductance was calculated from the current at the end of the pulse and assuming E K is 0 mV. The activation curves in Fig. 1 (E and F) have been fitted with the Boltzmann equation. Wild-type Kir3.1/Kir 3.4 had a half-maximal activation potential, V ½, of −39 ± 3 mV and a slope factor, k, of 13 ± 1 mV. The activation curves for Kir3.1-F137S/Kir 3.4 and Kir3.1-E139Q/Kir 3.4 are significantly less steep (k of 25 ± 1 and 22 ± 1 mV, respectively; p < 0.01, ttest), although V ½ (−42 ± 4 and −38 ± 3 mV, respectively) is comparable to that of the wild-type channel. Kofuji et al. (13Kofuji P. Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) failed to observe this change in the activation curve with the mutation Kir3.1-F137S; however, in their experiments Kir3.1-F137S was expressed alone, whereas in the present study it was expressed with Kir3.4 (see above). Block of wild-type and mutant Kir3.1/Kir3.4 is shown in Fig. 4. Currents shown in Fig. 4 A were obtained under control conditions, whereas those in Fig. 4 B were recorded in the presence of 30 μm Ba2+ (with the exception of Kir3.4-E145Q, which was obtained in the presence of a higher concentration). The dotted lines show the steady-state wild-type current (far left) recorded upon a pulse to −130 mV either in the absence or presence of Ba2+. Currents from mutant channels have been scaled so that the steady-state current at −130 mV in the absence of Ba2+ is the same as that for the wild-type channel. This scaling procedure allows the Ba2+ sensitivity of the wild-type and mutant channels to be compared. Fig. 4 C shows current-voltage relationships for the steady-state current plotted for different concentrations of Ba2+. From the data in Fig.4 C, dose-response curves were generated for each potential. Fig. 5 A shows the dose-response curves at −130 mV for the wild-type and mutant channels (dose-response curve for wild-type channel shown in every case). These have been fitted by the Hill equation (assuming a Hill coefficient of 1, i.e. one Ba2+ interacts with one channel to cause block).Figure 5Dose-response curves and voltage dependence of Ba2+ block. A, dose-response curves for steady-state Ba2+ block at −130 mV. Current remaining in the presence of Ba2+ as a percentage of the control current is plotted against the Ba2+ concentration. Steady-state current at the end of the pulse (duration: Kir3.1/Kir3.4-N179D, 3 s; other channels, 750 ms) was measured. Means ± S.E. are shown for wild-type channel (Kir3.1/Kir3.4) (n = 8), Kir3.1-F137S/Kir3.4 (n = 5), Kir3.1-E139Q/Kir3.4 (n = 6), Kir3.1/Kir3.4-E145Q (n = 6), and Kir3.1/Kir3.4-N179D (n = 5). Note the change in concentration range for Kir3.1/Kir3.4-E145Q. Data are fitted with the Hill equation: y = 100 − 100([Ba2+]/(Kdn + [Ba2+] n)), where y is the percentage current remaining, [Ba2+] is the Ba2+ concentration, and n is the Hill co-efficient (assumed to be 1).

The data have been fitted with Equation 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dissociation constant, K d, at −130 mV for Ba2+ block of the wild-type channel is 14 ± 1 μm (n = 5) (Fig. 5 A). The mutation Kir3.1-F137S produced a reduction of Ba2+ block as illustrated by the current records in Fig. 4 B and the current-voltage relationships in Fig. 4 C (compare with those for the wild-type channel). The K d at −130 mV for Ba2+ block of Kir3.1-F137S is 53 ± 4 μm(n = 5), higher than that of the wild-type channel (Fig. 5 A). The mutation Kir3.1-E139Q also produced a reduction of Ba2+ block (Fig. 4). The K dat −130 mV for Ba2+ block of Kir3.1-E139Q is 30 ± 5 μm (n = 5) (Fig. 5 A). The largest effect on Ba2+ block was observed with the mutation Kir3.4-E145Q. This mutation reduced Ba2+ sensitivity ∼500 fold. The currents for Kir3.4-E145Q in Fig. 4 B were recorded in the presence of 10 mm Ba2+ (rather than 30 μm Ba2+ as in the other cases). Note also the changed concentration range for the current-voltage relationships and the dose-response curves in Figs. 4 C and 5 A as compared with those for other channels. The K d at −130 mV for Ba2+ block of Kir3.4-E145Q was increased to 7 ± 1 mm (n = 12) (Fig.5 A). The effect of adding a potential Ba2+binding site is shown by the mutation Kir3.4-N179D. This mutation increased Ba2+ sensitivity (Fig. 4). TheK d at −130 mV for Ba2+ block of Kir3.4-N179D was reduced to 4 ± 1 μm(n = 5) (Fig. 5 A). A summary of the effect of all mutations investigated on theK d at −130 mV for Ba2+ block is shown in Fig. 6 A. TheK d for the wild-type channel is highlighted by thedotted line. Mutations in the H5 region had the biggest effect, mutations in the M2 region had smaller effects, and mutations in the C terminus had no effect. The effect of Kir3.4-E145Q was ∼100 fold larger than that of any other mutation and in this respect is in a special category (see “Discussion”). The effects of the mutations on Ba2+ sensitivity are comparable to the effects on slow activation (cf. Figs. 2 and 6 A). Fig. 6 B shows the K d at −130 mV plotted against the measure of slow activation used (current at 50 ms as a percentage of steady state) for each Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel (wild-type and mutant). Kir3.4-E145Q has been excluded as it is perhaps a special case (see above). Fig. 6 B shows that there is a significant correlation between the two sets of measurements (p = 0.0004). Therefore, in Kir3.1/Kir3.4 residues involved in slow activation also influence Ba2+ block. From dose-response curves at different potentials,K d was calculated for each potential, and theK d has been plotted against the membrane potential in Fig. 5 B for the wild-type and mutant channels (data for wild-type channel shown in every case). The plots ofK d versus membrane potential in Fig.5 B have been fitted by an exponential function of voltage according to the Woodhull model of channel block (26Woodhull A.M. J. Gen.

Sequence and mass spectrometry analysis were used to identify the chemically modified groups. Taken together, our data reveal the involvement of Arg-134 and Arg-204 in oxaloacetate coordination, suggest an indirect role for Arg-140 in substrate binding and catalysis, and clearly confirm that Arg-87 is implicated in cofactor binding. In contrast with NAD-malate dehydrogenase, no lactate dehydrogenase activity could be promoted by the R134Q mutation. The decreased susceptibility of the activation of the R204K mutant to NADP and its increased sensitivity to the histidine-specific reagent diethylpyrocarbonate indicated that Arg-204 is involved in the locking of the active site.

Miginiac-Maslow M. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The activation is the direct consequence of the reduction of specific disulfides located at the N- and C-terminal ends of each monomer of the homodimeric enzyme. In the oxidized form of the enzyme, the C-terminal end is trapped inside the active site cleft, where it acts as an internal inhibitor (2Johansson K. Ramaswamy S. Saarinen M. Lemaire-Chamley M.

The three-dimensional structure of the oxidized enzyme shows these Arg, and particularly Arg-204, to be situated in proximity of the negatively charged C-terminal residues (2Johansson K. Ramaswamy S.

However, there is no functional evidence so far about the involvement of these residues in blocking of the active site and in catalysis. Mutagenesis studies performed on NAD-MDH showed Arg-81, corresponding to Arg-134 of NADP-MDH, to be responsible for the specificity of the dehydrogenase for oxaloacetate; indeed, its mutation for a Gln, the corresponding residue in lactate dehydrogenases, conferred on the enzyme the ability to use pyruvate, thus transforming it into a bifunctional malate/lactate dehydrogenase (8Nicholls D.J.

Conversely, lactate dehydrogenase can be converted into a malate dehydrogenase by the mutation of the conserved Gln into an Arg (10Wilks H.M. Hart K.W. Feeney R. Dunn C.R. Muirhead H. Chia W.N.

In the present study, we focused on the evaluation of the roles of the conserved Arg of NADP-MDH to address the aforementioned points by using two complementary approaches: chemical derivatization and site-directed mutagenesis. In recent years great progress has been made toward understanding the mechanism of the reductive activation of chloroplastic NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.82) by reduced thioredoxin (1Ruelland E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The activation is the direct consequence of the reduction of specific disulfides located at the N- and C-terminal ends of each monomer of the homodimeric enzyme. In the oxidized form of the enzyme, the C-terminal end is trapped inside the active site cleft, where it acts as an internal inhibitor (2Johansson K. Ramaswamy S. Saarinen M. Lemaire-Chamley M.

It is released upon the thioredoxin-dependent reduction of the disulfide, thus opening the access for substrate oxaloacetate (5Krimm I. Goyer A. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Lancelin J.M.

The reduction of the N-terminal disulfide loosens the interaction between subunits and triggers a conformational change or/and an increased flexibility of the active site toward an improved catalytic efficiency. The catalytic His and Asp residues responsible for the acid-base catalytic mechanism have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis and chemical derivatization (6Lemaire M. Schmitter J-M.

Cys-509 is located in a C-terminal domain that is 42% identical to the conserved core of adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (adenylylsulfate) (APS) kinase. This domain is believed to provide the binding site for the allosteric effector, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). Replacement of Cys-509 with either Tyr or Ser destabilizes the R state, resulting in an enzyme that is intrinsically cooperative at pH 8 in the absence of PAPS. The kinetics of C509Y resemble those of the wild type enzyme in which Cys-509 has been covalently modified. The kinetics of C509S resemble those of the wild type enzyme in the presence of PAPS. It is likely that the negative charge on the Cys-509 side chain helps to stabilize the R state. Treatment of the enzyme with a low level of trypsin results in cleavage at Lys-527, a residue that lies in a region analogous to a PAPS motif-containing mobile loop of true APS kinase. Both mutant enzymes were cleaved more rapidly than the wild type enzyme, suggesting that movement of the mobile loop occurs during the R to T transition.

Schultz T. Re E. Mazer J. Chandler C.J. Barron A. Segel I.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 674-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complete modification of SH-1 (six per hexamer) changes the initial velocity kinetics at pH 8 from normal-hyperbolic (Hill coefficient,n H = 1) to sigmoidal (n Happroximately 2) with a concomitant increase in the [S]0.5 values for MgATP and SO42− (or MoO42−);V max app at a fixed subsaturating cosubstrate level is reduced (2Renosto F.

A number of experimental approaches, including protection against chemical inactivation by reversibly bound ligands (2Renosto F. Martin R.L. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16279-16288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), direct binding measurements (3Martin R.L. Daley L.A. Lovric Z. Wailes L.M. Renosto F. Segel I.H. J. Biol.

The dramatic effect of in vitro modification of SH-1 suggested several possible scenarios, including that modification induces a conformational state in the enzyme that is normally inducedin vivo by a reversibly bound allosteric effector. The effector was subsequently shown to be PAPS (4Renosto F. Martin R.L. Wailes L.M. Daley L.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10300-10308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Biophys. 1991; 290: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) didnot respond in the same way to Cys modification or to PAPS. The cumulative results indicated that (a) fungal ATP sulfurylase possesses an allosteric PAPS binding site that is not present in the enzyme from other sources and (b) SH-1 is either in the region of, or in communication with, the PAPS binding site. Fungal sulfurylase was subsequently shown to possess a C-terminal region (approximately residues 396–539) that is 42% identical to the conserved core of APS kinase (9Foster B.A. Thomas S.M. Mahr J.A.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a protein with a high affinity for PAPS. SH-1 is Cys-509, which is located in the APS kinase-like C-terminal domain, a few residues upstream from a putative PAPS motif (12Satishchandran C. Hickman Y.N. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11684-11688Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is likely that residues 396–540 of P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase evolved from true APS kinase and that this region provides the allosteric binding site for PAPS. In effect, the C-terminal region of fungal ATP sulfurylase is a regulatory subunit that happens to be covalently linked to the catalytic subunit. 3For a while, the GenBank™ entry for P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase (accession number A53651) described the enzyme as a “probable PAPS synthetase” and suggested that the enzyme possesses APS kinase activity. This information (which was not submitted by us) is incorrect and contrary to published accounts. The homogeneous enzyme does not have measurable APS kinase activity (<0.001 units × mg of protein−1 under standard assay conditions where true APS kinase from P. chrysogenumexhibits about 25 units × mg of protein−1). Yeast ATP sulfurylase (GenBank™ accession number S55198) was described in similar terms. But this enzyme is even less likely to possess APS kinase activity, considering that it does not possess an APS kinase-like region. In contrast, the enzyme from Aquifex aeolicus (GenBank™ accession number AE000722), which also possesses a C-terminal APS kinase-like domain, may very well be bifunctional, considering the similarity of the P-loop and PAPS motif sequences to those of true APS kinases. Our preliminary hypothesis (in terms of the concerted transition model) was that covalent modification of Cys-509 promotes the same R to T allosteric transition (13Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6150) Google Scholar, 14Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1993: 421-464Google Scholar) as does PAPS binding. The inhibition of P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase by PAPS may be the way that fungi prevent PAPS accumulation to toxic levels. Another consideration is that in fungi, PAPS is a major branch point metabolite of sulfate assimilation. One branch leads to cysteine and other reduced sulfur compounds; the other branch to choline-O-sulfate, a sulfur storage compound and/or osmoprotectant (15Ballio A. Chain E.B. Dentice di Accadia F. Navizio F. Rossi C. Ventura M.T. Sel. Sci. Papers Istituto Superiore Sanita. 1959; 2: 343-353Google Scholar, 16Itahashi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1961; 50: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17Renosto F. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 416-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Hanson A.D. Rathinasabapathi B. Chamberlin B. Gage D.A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus the inhibition may be part of a more extensive sequential feedback process. In contrast, yeasts and most bacteria do not form large quantities of sulfate esters, whereas plants (and some bacteria) preferentially use APS (rather than PAPS) as the substrate for the reductive assimilation of sulfate. In other words, PAPS is not at a branch point in these other organisms. The objective of the present study was to establish the role of Cys-509 in stabilizing the R state. To this end, we investigated the kinetic consequences of replacing Cys-509 with either tyrosine or serine. Mutations in codon 509 were made by PCR amplification of the C-terminal 221 base pairs of the fungal ATP sulfurylase gene (codons 506–573). This sequence begins with an indigenous XhoI site 3 base pairs upstream from codon 509 and ends after the stop codon with an engineered XbaI site. Each PCR used a cloned cDNA copy of the native gene as the template, the C-terminal coding primer PcATS308 (5′-GGTCTAGATCTTACTGACGCTCCAGGAAACCC-3′), and an upstream primer containing the XhoI site and the desired mutation. Upstream primers with their respective produced mutations were as follows: PcATS315 (C059S), 5′-TCCCCTCGAGCACTCTGAGCAGTCCG-3′; PcATS317 (C509Y), 5′-TCCCCTCGAGCACTACGAGCAGTCCG-3′. All PCRs were carried out using the DNA polymerase Pfu (Stratagene). The resulting 221-base pair DNAs were subcloned as XhoI-XbaI fragments into a pBluescript KS(+) plasmid containing a cDNA clone of fungal ATP sulfurylase in which the wild type C-terminal 221 base pairs had been removed. All cloned PCR fragments were sequenced to ensure that the desired mutations were introduced. Sequenced ATP sulfurylase genes were cloned asNdeI-BglII fragments into the Novagen pET23a(+) plasmid and introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. About 0.2 ml of an 8-h culture was used to inoculate two 3-liter Fernbach flasks each containing 1000 ml of LB ampicillin medium. The cultures were grown aerobically at 37 °C for 8–10 h and then transferred to 15 °C. Upon transfer to 15 °C, 1 g of α-lactose was added per liter of culture to induce protein expression. After 8–10 h at 15 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. Approximately 4–8 ml of packed cells was obtained. The cells were then resuspended in about 50 ml of chilled 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and lysed in a single pass through a Watts Fluidair Microfluidizer (model B12–04DJC M3). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant fluid was applied to a blue dextran (19Ryan L.D. Vestling C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 160: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) column (2.5 × 10 cm) that had been equilibrated with 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. The column was then washed with the same buffer at 6 ml/min until the effluent had an A 280 nm of 0.005 or less. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.7m) in 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 (total volume 500 ml) at a flow rate of 2 ml per min. 7-ml fractions were collected, and their A 280 nm and ATP sulfurylase activity were measured. Fractions containing enzyme activity (coincident with the major protein peak) were pooled (total volume approximately 85 ml), dialyzed against 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and then applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. After a brief wash, protein was eluted at 1 ml per min with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.4 m) in 40 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0 (total volume, 400 ml). Seven fractions containing ATP sulfurylase activity (total volume 49 ml) were pooled, divided into 1-ml aliquots, and stored frozen. A typical preparation yielded about 25 mg of pure enzyme. TheA 280 nm/A 260 nm ratio of the enzymes ranged from 1.91 (for C509Y) to 2.01 (for C509S). SDS gel electrophoresis indicated that all the enzymes were at least 95% pure. The absence of Cys-509 in the mutant enzymes was confirmed by demonstrating their lack of reactivity with DTNB in the absence of SDS (1Renosto F. Schultz T. Re E. Mazer J. Chandler C.J. Barron A. Segel I.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 674-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most biochemicals, buffers, column media, and coupling enzymes were obtained from Sigma. PAPS was prepared as described previously (20MacRae I. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Concentrations of stock solutions were established by enzymatic analysis using Nuclease P1 coupled to ATP sulfurylase, hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the presence of excess PPi, MgCl2, NADP+, and 1 mm glucose. ATP sulfurylase concentrations were determined from the relationship: concmg × ml−1 =A 280 nm/0.871 (21Tweedie J.W. Segel I.H. Prep. Biochem. 1971; 1: 91-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). (In theory, this results in a 3% error in the assumed concentration of C509Y.) ATP sulfurylase activity was characterized by the continuous, coupled spectrophotometric molybdolysis assay (22Segel I.H. Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 334-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in the presence of NADH, P-enolpyruvate, KCl, excess adenylate kinase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, sulfate-free pyruvate kinase + lactate dehydrogenase, and approximately 0.5 μg (0.02 unit) of pure P. chrysogenum APS kinase (10MacRae I. Rose A.B. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28583-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Segel I.H. Renosto F. Seubert P.A.

The stoichiometry of the assay is 2 mol of NADH oxidized per mol of AMP formed. In addition to providing good sensitivity, this assay has the advantage in that both primary substrates, MgATP and MoO42−, are continuously regenerated. The APS kinase serves to remove traces of APS formed from contaminating inorganic sulfate during the preincubation period (20MacRae I. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). (APS is a potent product inhibitor of the enzyme, whereas the small increment of PAPS formed is innocuous.) Unless indicated otherwise, all assays were conducted at 30 °C, in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. The total MgCl2 present was always 5 mm greater than that of the total ATP. The specific activities of the wild type, C509S, and C509Y forms of the enzyme freshly purified from the E. coli expression system and assayed at 5 mm total ATP, 10 mm total Mg2+ (as MgCl2), and 10 mmMoO42− were, in order, 20, 17, and 14.5 units × mg of protein−1. 1 unit is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of primary product in 1 min. For each experimental velocity curve, theV max value and the Hill coefficient,n H, were determined by fitting the plottedv versus [substrate] data to the Hill equation: v=Vmax[S] nHK′+[S] nHEquation 1 Hill coefficients were also determined as the slope of the Hill plot,logvVmax−v=nHlog[S]−logK′,Equation 2 in the region corresponding to 50% saturation (i.e.where log [v/(V max −v)] = 0) or over the range corresponding to 10–90% saturation (14Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1993: 421-464Google Scholar). Curve-fits were obtained using DeltaGraph 4.05c (Macintosh) with all points weighted equally. Then H of a single plot determined by the three methods generally agreed to within 0.1. The n Hof replicate curves obtained at different times generally agreed to within <0.15. Although the Hill coefficient was useful for comparing the sigmoidicity of different velocity curves, ultimately, differences in n H need to be related to the complete velocity equation for an allosteric bireactant enzyme (see “”). Fig.1 shows the velocity curves of the C509Y mutant enzyme under standard assay conditions. The most striking feature of the curves is that they are sigmoidal in the absence of PAPS. In fact, the increase in n H with increasing concentrations of the fixed cosubstrate is the same trend displayed by the wild type enzyme after covalent modification of Cys-509 (data not shown). 4The native enzyme modified with NEM at Cys-509 yielded the following data: The n H of thev versus [MgATP] plots increased from 1.2 at 0.2 mm MoO42− to 2.0 at 5 mm MoO42−. Then H of the v versus[MoO42−] plots increased from 1.8 at 0.3 mm MgATP to 2.1 at 5 mm MgATP. Up to this point, the results suggested that cooperative behavior is induced by either (a) increasing the bulk of the side chain at position 509 or (b) eliminating the negative charge (R-S−) at this position. It was thought that replacing Cys-509 with the slightly smaller and uncharged Ser might help to distinguish between these two possibilities. Fig.2 shows the velocity curves of the C509S enzyme at several different fixed concentrations of cosubstrate. Despite the size similarity of Ser and Cys, the plots are again sigmoidal, although, compared with C509Y, C509S has a lower [S]0.5 for either substrate at any given concentration of cosubstrate. Also, unlike the curves shown in Fig. 1, then H values of the v versus[MgATP] plots for C509S do not change significantly with increasing [MoO42−]. At subsaturating MgATP, thev versus [MoO42−] curves are also sigmoidal, but n H approaches unity as the concentration of MgATP approaches saturation. This trend is consistent with the preferential binding of MgATP to free E of the R state. That is, as the fixed [MgATP] approaches saturation, the enzyme is driven far toward the R state, which binds MoO42−in a normal hyperbolic manner. At 5 mm MgATP, the K m for MoO42−is 0.1 mm, which is the same as that of the noncooperative wild type enzyme. In terms of Equation 9 (), L app for C509S at saturating MgATP (equivalent to Lc) must be very small, implying that c is less than unity. The sigmoidicity of thev versus MoO42−plot at subsaturating MgATP can be attributed, at least in part, to the synergism between MgATP and MoO42−. That is, even if K ibT =K ibR (e = 1), andK mbT = K mbR(j = 1), the v versus[B] plots can be sigmoidal at subsaturating [A] if (a) substrate A binds preferentially to the R state (c < 1), and (b) the substrates bind to the R state synergistically (f < 1). The last condition seems highly likely given that the R state should closely resemble the noncooperative wild type enzyme where theK m value for each substrate is smaller than the corresponding K i value (1Renosto F. Schultz T. Re E. Mazer J. Chandler C.J. Barron A. Segel I.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 674-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bireactant kinetics of C509S are similar to those of the wild type enzyme in the presence of PAPS. 5The wild type enzyme yielded the following data at 50 μm PAPS: The nH of the v versus [MgATP] plots varied from approximately 1.5 at 0.1 mm MoO42− to 1.7 at 1 mmMoO42−. The nH of the v veresus [MoO4] plots decreased from approximately 2 to 0.05 mm MgATP to approximately 1 at 2.5 mm MgATP. Comparing the above results with those of the C509Y enzyme leads to the conclusions that either (a) substituting a Tyr residue for Cys-509 drives the enzyme much further toward the T state than does substituting a Ser at this position or (b) the T state induced by substituting Tyr at position 509 is structurally different from that induced by substituting Ser (see “Discussion”). In either case, the results show that cooperative behavior is a not simply a result of increasing the bulk of the residue at position 509. Either the negative charge on the side chain of Cys-509 plays a critical role in stabilizing the R state, or the side chain size is extremely important and any change will favor a shift to the T state. Activation by a competitive inhibitor at low 6Exactly how “low” the competitive substrate must be to demonstrate activation is best established by trial and error. For a simple unireactant system where S and I bind exclusively to the R state, the peak velocity occurs at θ = n L(n−1) − α − 1, where θ = [I]/K iand α = [S]/K s. Thus as the fixed [S] is increased, the peak moves closer to the vertical axis and eventually disappears.competitive substrate concentrations is a hallmark of true cooperative binding. As shown in Fig. 3, inorganic thiosulfate, an inhibitor competitive with SO42− or MoO42− (24Seubert P.A. Hoang L. Renosto F. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), does exactly that. Activation by S2O32− is also seen with the wild type enzyme after chemical modification of Cys-509 (2Renosto F. Martin R.L. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16279-16288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or in the presence of PAPS (4Renosto F. Martin R.L. Wailes L.M. Daley L.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10300-10308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20MacRae I. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Note that the experimental level of the noncompetitive cosubstrate (MgATP) influences the effect of the competitive inhibitor. That is, the activation is eliminated by an MgATP concentration that is too low in the case of C509Y, or too high in the case of C509S. These opposite effects are consistent with the different effects of MgATP binding on the cooperativity of the two mutant enzymes as illustrated in Figs.1 b and 2 b. The side chain of a Ser residue is not much smaller than that of a Cys residue, but unlike Ser, a substantial fraction of the Cys side chain may be ionized at the standard assay pH of 8.0. The observation that C509S is intrinsically cooperative raised the possibility that the charge on residue 509 plays a major role in stabilizing the R state. If the side chain of Cys-509 behaves normally (i.e. has a pK a of 8.0–8.5), decreasing the assay pH from 8.0 to (e.g.) 6.5 would decrease the fraction of the residue in the Cys-S− form significantly. It was of interest then to determine whether protonating the Cys anion of the wild type enzyme had the same effect as substituting Ser for Cys. As shown in Table I, decreasing the pH did indeed induce sigmoidal v versus[MoO42−] curves. Lowering the pH also decreased V max,app and increased the [S]0.5. However, the wild type enzyme at pH 6.5 did not mimic C509S: First, the velocity curve remained sigmoidal at 5 mm MgATP (n H = 2.1). Second, the enzyme at pH 6.5 was activated by S2O32− only at high concentrations of MgATP (data not shown). In these respects, the enzyme behaved like C509Y rather than C509S. Surprisingly, then H of C509S also increased as the assay pH was decreased (n H was 1.8 at pH 8.0 and 2.3 at pH 6.5). Consequently, we cannot conclude that the sigmoidicity induced in the wild type enzyme was solely a response to protonating Cys-509. Considering the pH range studied, it is likely that protonating one or more His residues can contribute to an R to T transition. Several His residues are located in the C-terminal domain, including one adjacent to Cys-509 (His-508). His has been shown to be essential for ATP sulfurylase activity (5Yu M. Martin R.L. Jain S.

Lower pH values could not be studied because a protein precipitate would form in the assay mixtures. The experiments described in Table I were conducted in MES-Tris buffers in which the MES concentration increased as the pH was decreased. However, MES per se was not responsible for the sigmoidicity as evidenced by the hyperbolic velocity curves obtained in 0.05M MES (plus Tris to pH 8). It was of interest to determine whether PAPS had an additional effect on a mutant enzyme, or whether the mutation transformed the enzyme completely to the T state. As shown in Fig. 4, the n Hvalue of C509S increased further as the concentration of PAPS was increased. At 240 μm [PAPS], then H of the v versus [MgATP] plot was nearly 3. Thus the Cys to Ser mutation promoted only a partial shift toward the T state allowing the R to T equilibrium to be driven further toward the T state or back toward the R state by the appropriate ligand. In this respect, C509S resembles a typical allosteric enzyme. The apparent n H limit of 3 (instead of 6) is very likely a consequence of the nonexclusive binding of PAPS and/or substrates. However, the possibility that the enzyme behaves in an alternating “half-of-the-sites” manner cannot be immediately discarded. The effect of PAPS onV max,app indicates that either (a) the catalytic activity of the T state is much less than that of the R state, or (b) substrate binding to the T state is not highly synergistic, or (c) both conditions apply. In contrast to the results shown in Fig. 4, PAPS decreased the sigmoidicity of the v versus [MgATP] plot of C509Y: At 1 mm MoO42−in the absence of PAPS, n H andV max,app were, respectively, 2.3 and 12.2 units × mg of protein−1. At 240 μm PAPS, n H was 2.0;V max,app decreased to 6.8 units × mg of protein−1 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, tre"
