https://openalex.org/W2065417952,"TMEM16A (ANO1) functions as a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC). We developed pharmacological tools to investigate the contribution of TMEM16A to CaCC conductance in human airway and intestinal epithelial cells. A screen of ∼110,000 compounds revealed four novel chemical classes of small molecule TMEM16A inhibitors that fully blocked TMEM16A chloride current with an IC(50) < 10 μM, without interfering with calcium signaling. Following structure-activity analysis, the most potent inhibitor, an aminophenylthiazole (T16A(inh)-A01), had an IC(50) of ∼1 μM. Two distinct types of inhibitors were identified. Some compounds, such as tannic acid and the arylaminothiophene CaCC(inh)-A01, fully inhibited CaCC current in human bronchial and intestinal cells. Other compounds, including T16A(inh)-A01 and digallic acid, inhibited total CaCC current in these cells poorly, but blocked mainly an initial, agonist-stimulated transient chloride current. TMEM16A RNAi knockdown also inhibited mainly the transient chloride current. In contrast to the airway and intestinal cells, all TMEM16A inhibitors fully blocked CaCC current in salivary gland cells. We conclude that TMEM16A carries nearly all CaCC current in salivary gland epithelium, but is a minor contributor to total CaCC current in airway and intestinal epithelia. The small molecule inhibitors identified here permit pharmacological dissection of TMEM16A/CaCC function and are potential development candidates for drug therapy of hypertension, pain, diarrhea, and excessive mucus production."
https://openalex.org/W2126932378,"The mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) serves as the site for ATP production by hosting the oxidative phosphorylation complex machinery most notably on the crista membranes. Disruption of the crista structure has been implicated in a variety of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we characterize ChChd3, a previously identified PKA substrate of unknown function (Schauble, S., King, C. C., Darshi, M., Koller, A., Shah, K., and Taylor, S. S. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 14952–14959), and show that it is essential for maintaining crista integrity and mitochondrial function. In the mitochondria, ChChd3 is a peripheral protein of the IM facing the intermembrane space. RNAi knockdown of ChChd3 in HeLa cells resulted in fragmented mitochondria, reduced OPA1 protein levels and impaired fusion, and clustering of the mitochondria around the nucleus along with reduced growth rate. Both the oxygen consumption and glycolytic rates were severely restricted. Ultrastructural analysis of these cells revealed aberrant mitochondrial IM structures with fragmented and tubular cristae or loss of cristae, and reduced crista membrane. Additionally, the crista junction opening diameter was reduced to 50% suggesting remodeling of cristae in the absence of ChChd3. Analysis of the ChChd3-binding proteins revealed that ChChd3 interacts with the IM proteins mitofilin and OPA1, which regulate crista morphology, and the outer membrane protein Sam50, which regulates import and assembly of β-barrel proteins on the outer membrane. Knockdown of ChChd3 led to almost complete loss of both mitofilin and Sam50 proteins and alterations in several mitochondrial proteins, suggesting that ChChd3 is a scaffolding protein that stabilizes protein complexes involved in maintaining crista architecture and protein import and is thus essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function.

Mitochondria are ubiquitous and dynamic organelles that undergo frequent fission and fusion and are actively transported to specific cellular locations based on energy requirements. The highly organized structure of mitochondria and the nature of mitochondrial protein complexes enable them to sense the cellular environment and regulate ATP synthesis, metabolism, and other key physiological processes according to the energy requirements. In the past decade, several crucial regulators of mitochondrial structure, dynamics and function, have been identified and characterized in fungi, Drosophila, and mammals (1Chan D.C. Annu. Rev.

Although significant advances have been made in identifying the proteins involved in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, very little is known about the protein complexes that control the biogenesis of cristae and crista junctions (CJs).

Furthermore, OPA1 and mitofilin are suggested to be at the CJs and involved in CJ formation and control the CJ opening (10Frezza C. Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Micaroni M. Beznoussenko G.V.

Coiled-coil helix coiled-coil helix domain-containing protein 3 (ChChd3/FLJ20420/LOC54927/RIKEn cDNA 0610041L09) was previously identified in our laboratory as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) substrate in mitochondria (15Schauble S.

Proteomic studies and in situ hybridization experiments identified ChChd3 as a highly abundant protein at synaptic membranes and in neurons of rat brain throughout the gray matter, dorsal root ganglion, and spinal cord (16Dreger M. Mika J. Bieller A. Jahnel R. Gillen C. Schaefer M.K. Weihe E. Hucho F. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ChChd3 was found to be significantly down-regulated in mitochondrial proteomic analysis of a cell line model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis expressing SOD1 mutant G93A compared with the control cells expressing WT SOD1 (17Fukada K. Zhang F. Vien A. Cashman N.R. Zhu H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 1211-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), suggesting its possible role in the pathophysiology of human disease. ChChd3 is highly conserved in mammals with human and mouse protein sharing ∼92% sequence similarity. Orthologs of the protein are present throughout the metazoans, whereas no homologs are so far seen in fungi or plants. In humans, the ChChd3 gene maps on chromosome 7 (7q32.3-q33), and the coding sequence of the protein has 8 exons that can potentially generate nine splice variants. Full-length ChChd3 has 227 amino acids with an N-terminal myristoylation motif followed by a DUF737 domain (domain of unknown function), and a coiled-coil helix-coiled-coil helix (chch) domain (Fig. 1, A and B). DUF domain belongs to the large set of protein families in the data base whose function is not known. The C-terminal chch domain, on the other hand, is primarily seen in mitochondrial proteins and was known to be involved in the protein import and metal binding in the IMS (18Banci L. Bertini I.

Each helix in the chch domain contains two of the four conserved cysteines arranged in CX9C or CX3C manner, and in the functional mature protein the cysteines are known to be oxidized forming two intramolecular disulfide bonds, essential for the proper folding and structural stabilization of the protein. The mitochondrial disulfide relay system mediated by Mia40 and Erv1 has been proposed as the principal mechanism for the transport and subsequent folding of the cysteine-containing proteins in the IMS (22Mesecke N. Terziyska N. Kozany C. Baumann F. Neupert W. Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Although there is some evidence that ChChd3 is an abundant protein and localized to the mitochondria (15Schauble S. King C.C. Darshi M. Koller A. Shah K. Taylor S.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 115: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), the role of the protein has remained poorly understood with no systematic study describing its cellular localization and/or biological function. In this comprehensive study, we describe a potential role of this protein in regulating mitochondrial structure and function. We show that ChChd3 is localized to the IM facing the IMS and exists in a complex with the IM proteins mitofilin and OPA1 and the OM protein Sam50. Furthermore, we analyzed the consequence of down-regulation of ChChd3 in HeLa cells by using the RNAi method and demonstrate that ChChd3 plays an essential role in maintaining CJ architecture, crista morphology, and mitochondrial function. Polyclonal antibodies against internal peptide sequence corresponding to ChChd3 mouse (QAKKESEHQRRLKQARDLERER) and human (QAKKESEDQKRLKQAKELDRER) protein sequence were generated in rabbits (Invitrogen). The other commercial antibodies used are described in supplemental material. The mouse cDNA clone for ChChd3 (BC021941) in pCMV-SP6 vector was procured from Invitrogen (catalog no. 5124504) and subsequently subcloned into a modified C-terminally FLAG-tagged pCMV-SP1 vector by using EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. Point mutations G2A ChChd3 and K38A Drp1GFP were made by QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). ΔCT and ΔNT mutants were made by PCR amplification and subcloning by standard protocols. The cDNA clones for mitofilin (catalog no. SC320269, reference sequence NM_006839) in pCMV6-AC vector and Sam50 (catalog no. SC108289, reference sequence NM_015380) in pCVM6-XL5 vector were purchased from OriGene and subcloned into C-terminally FLAG tagged pCMV-SP1 vector. The cDNA clones for Drp1 GFP and mito-RFP were received as gifts from Dr. Stefan Strack at the University of Iowa and Dr. Luca Scorrano at Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, respectively. Mitochondria from mouse liver were isolated, and Histodenz gradient purified as described previously (24Pagliarini D.J. Wiley S.E. Kimple M.E. Dixon J.R. Kelly P. Worby C.A. Casey P.J. Dixon J.E.

Mitochondrial subfractions were obtained by swell-shrink procedure and purified by using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation method (24Pagliarini D.J. Wiley S.E. Kimple M.E. Dixon J.R. Kelly P.

For trypsin digestion experiments, mitochondria were isolated without protease inhibitors throughout the preparation. 100 μg of freshly isolated mitochondria, swollen mitochondria, and submitochondrial particles were incubated with 2.5 μg of trypsin in 0.125 m sucrose and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 5–30 min with or without 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature. 200 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to quench the reaction, and the samples were immediately boiled in the presence of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. 10 μg of the sample was separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot. A 29-mer short hairpin RNA (shRNA), 5′-TATCAGAAAGCTGCTGAGAGGTGGAAGC-3′ corresponding to the nucleotide sequence 489–516 of human ChChd3 in a pRS vector (OriGene) with U6 promoter and puromycin-resistant gene, was used to generate stable knockdown of ChChd3 in HeLa cells. Control stable cells were generated by using a scrambled sequence 5′-GCACTACCAGAGCTAACTCAGATAGTACT-3′ in pRS vector. HeLa cells maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% GlutaMAX grown to 40% confluency in 35 mm plates were transfected with ChChd3-shRNA or scrambled-control using Turbofectin (OriGene) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and stable cell lines were selected in 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). An XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences) was used to measure the rates of oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification in 24-well plates (Seahorse Biosciences) as described previously (25Wu M. Neilson A. Swift A.L. Moran R. Tamagnine J. Parslow D. Armistead S. Lemire K. Orrell J. Teich J. Chomicz S. Ferrick D.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C125-C136Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were plated in growth medium at 3 × 104 cells/well 16 h prior to experimentation. The assay medium was unbuffered DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 10 mm pyruvate, and 2 mm glutamine, pH 7.4, to which 10× additions were made from the cartridge injection ports. Assay cycles included 3 min of mixing and a 2 min waiting period, followed by 3 min of measurement. An updated algorithm that more accurately accounts for oxygen diffusion through the plastic plate was used for data analysis (26Gerencser A.A. Mark K.A. Hubbard A.E. Divakaruni A.S. Mehrabian Z. Nicholls D.G. Polster B.M. J. Neurochem. 2009; 110: 990-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cellular ATP levels were measured by using a CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). Briefly, control and ChChd3 knockdown cells were seeded in a 96-well plate with 35,000 cells per well in a 100 μl volume. After 6 h, 100 μl of CellTiter-Glo® reagent was added to each well and mixed for 2 min. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, luminescence was measured in a GENios microplate reader (Tecan). ATP levels were normalized to protein levels. Control and ChChd3 knockdown HeLa cells were grown to 60% confluency on poly-d-lysine-coated glass dishes (MatTek) and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 5 min at room temperature, followed by 30 min on ice for optimal cellular ultrastructural preservation. The cells were washed five times, 2 min each in ice-cold 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, with 3 mm calcium chloride. The cultured cells were post-fixed in ice-cold 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with 0.8% potassium ferrocyanide (Sigma) and 3 mm calcium chloride (Sigma). After 30 min, the cells were washed five times in double-distilled water for 2 min each and stained en block in ice-cold 2% uranyl acetate overnight to increase membrane contrast. The cultured cells were dehydrated in an ethanol series for 3 min each with 20, 50, 70, and 90% ethanol on ice followed by four changes of 100% ethanol at room temperature. The dehydrated cells were infiltrated in a 1:1 ratio of absolute ethanol to Durcupan ACM epoxy resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 30 min followed by three changes of Durcupan ACM epoxy resin for 1 h each. The dishes with epoxy resin infiltrated culture cells were then placed in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 48–72 h for the resin polymerization. After polymerization, the coverslips were removed from the dishes, and plastic blocks were sawed out and glued on to dummy blocks. 80 nm ultrathin serial sections were prepared using a Reichert-Jung Ultra-cut E ultramicrotome and Diatome diamond knife. The sections were supported on copper grids/75 mesh (Ted Pella). The 80-nm sections were post-stained in Sato lead for 1 min, and the stained sections were imaged onto negatives using a JEM-1200EX I electron microscope operated at 80 kV. The negatives were digitized at 1800 dpi using a Nikon CoolScan system, giving an image size of 4033 × 6010 pixel array and a pixel resolution of 1.77 nm. For electron tomography, sections were cut from the same blocks used for conventional transmission electron microscopy at a nominal thickness of 0.5 μm and collected on 100:100 clamshell grids. These sections were poststained for 15 min in a 2% uranyl acetate solution followed by 15 min in Sato lead solution. Two sizes of colloidal gold particles, 15 and 20 nm in diameter, were deposited on opposite sides of the section to serve as fiducial cues. For stability in the beam, the section was coated with carbon. For each reconstruction, a single series of images was collected with a JEOL 4000EX intermediate high voltage electron microscope operated at 400 kV. The specimens were irradiated for about 30 min before initiating a tilt series to limit anisotropic specimen thinning during image collection. During data collection, the illumination was held to near parallel beam conditions. Single-tilt series were recorded using a 4 × 4k slow scan CCD camera controlled by serial EM at 12,000 magnification. Angular increments of 2° usually from −60 to +60° about an axis perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope were achieved using a computer-controlled goniometer to increment accurately the angular steps. The pixel resolution was 1.2 nm. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, each image was binned down two times by averaging adjacent pixels so that the final pixel resolution was 2.4 nm. The IMOD software package (27Kremer J.R. Mastronarde D.N. McIntosh J.R. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (3621) Google Scholar) was used for the complete image processing unless there were problems, and then TxBR software was used to refine the alignment and reconstruction (28Lawrence A. Bouwer J.C. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 154: 144-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Six reconstructed volumes were analyzed (three control and three ChChd3 knockdown). Volume segmentation was performed by manual tracing in the planes of highest resolution (X-Y) with the program Xvoxtrace (29Perkins G.A. Renken C.W. Song J.Y. Frey T.G. Young S.J. Lamont S. Martone M.E. Lindsey S. Ellisman M.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The reconstructions were visualized using Analyze (Mayo Foundation) and the surface-rendering graphics of Synu (National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research) as described by Perkins et al. (29Perkins G.A. Renken C.W. Song J.Y. Frey T.G. Young S.J. Lamont S. Martone M.E. Lindsey S. Ellisman M.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These programs allow one to step through slices of the reconstruction in any orientation and to model and display features of interest in three dimensions. Measurements of mitochondrial outer and inner boundary and crista membrane surface areas and volumes were made within segmented volumes by the programs Synuarea and Synuvolume, respectively (National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research, University of California San Diego). Crista junction opening sizes and crista junction densities were measured with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) using the tomographic volumes. For immunoprecipitation of transiently expressed FLAG-tagged proteins, HEK293 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) by following the manufacturer's protocols. Approximately 20 h post-transfection, cells were harvested in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) with a protease inhibitor mixture set (Calbiochem), and the cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with buffer A (four times) and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot. For immunoprecipitating ChChd3 from mouse liver mitochondria, gradient-purified mitochondria was lysed in buffer A with protease inhibitor mixture set and pre-cleared on protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C to prevent any nonspecific binding. Pre-cleared samples were incubated with ChChd3 antibody or the corresponding preimmune serum at 4 °C for 5 h and immunocaptured with protein A-agarose beads. After overnight incubation, the beads were washed five times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, with a protease inhibitor mixture, eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed on the SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot. Soluble/cytoplasmic and insoluble/mitochondrial fractions were isolated from the control and ChChd3 knockdown HeLa cells as described earlier (30Sun M.G. Williams J. Munoz-Pinedo C. Perkins G.A. Brown J.M. Ellisman M.H. Green D.R. Frey T.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed with the lysis buffer (80 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 50 μg/ml digitonin, and 1 mm DTT) with a protease inhibitor mixture, and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) and the pellet containing mitochondrial fraction were used for Western blot analysis. Data from populations of mitochondria from EM micrographs are represented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise mentioned. Comparisons between the two groups were made using a Student's t test unless otherwise stated. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism. ChChd3 has a well conserved myristoylation site at the N-terminal Gly-2 and a PKA phosphorylation site at Thr-11 (Fig. 1A). N-Myristoylation is a co-translational modification known to promote membrane binding that is essential for proper protein localization or biological function (31Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). To determine whether ChChd3 is myristoylated, we immunoprecipitated transiently expressed FLAG-tagged ChChd3 from HEK293 cells and separated it by SDS-PAGE, and tryptic peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of m/z 859.5251, corresponding to the myristoylated N terminus (myrGGTASTR). Fragmentation of this peptide unequivocally showed that the N-terminal glycine is myristoylated (supplemental Fig. S1). We initially identified ChChd3 in purified mouse liver mitochondrial fractions and later showed that both endogenous and transiently expressed ChChd3 is localized to mitochondria (15Schauble S.

To further define the submitochondrial location of ChChd3, we fractionated purified mouse liver mitochondria into OM, IMS, IM, and matrix compartments as described previously (24Pagliarini D.J.

Equal amounts of protein from each of these fractions were analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies against ChChd3 and known marker proteins. ChChd3 was primarily enriched in the IM fraction along with trace amounts associated with the OM (Fig. 1C). To further dissect the orientation of ChChd3 on the IM, we performed limited trypsinolysis on intact mitochondria, mitochondria swollen in hypotonic media (swollen mitochondria, with ruptured OM and intact IM), and submitochondrial particles (inside-out mitochondrial vesicles that expose the matrix face of the IM). Immunoblotting of the trypsin-digested samples revealed that ChChd3 in swollen mitochondria is susceptible to more rapid trypsinolysis compared with that of submitochondrial particles and pure mitochondria (Fig. 1D) suggesting that ChChd3 is located on the IM facing the IMS. When submitochondrial particles and mitochondrial membranes were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, ChChd3 was digested completely. Proteolysis of ChChd3 was similar to that of OPA1 (Fig. 1D), an IM protein facing the IMS (4Olichon A. Emorine L.J. Descoins E. Pelloquin L. Brichese L. Gas N. Guillou E. Delettre C. Valette A. Hamel C.P. Ducommun B. Lenaers G. Belenguer P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that ChChd3 is localized on the IM facing IMS. To explore the functional role of ChChd3 in mitochondria, we silenced ChChd3 gene expression using RNAi. For this purpose, we generated a panel of HeLa clonal cell lines that stably express shRNA specific for ChChd3 or a scrambled control sequence. The mitochondrial morphology in the scrambled control (control-shRNA) and from two independent clones of ChChd3 knockdown cells was assessed by using transiently expressed matrix-targeted RFP (mito-RFP). Interestingly, ∼70% of the cells lacking ChChd3 showed fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and clustering of the mitochondria around the nucleus (Fig. 2, A and B) compared with the control-shRNA and control-HeLa cells, which displayed elongated and evenly distributed mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Because it appeared that loss of ChChd3 results in an imbalance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, we next examined these cells for changes in protein levels of the key players of mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1) and fission (Drp1) processes (1Chan D.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 79-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). We found a significant increase in DRP1 and a decrease in both the long and short isoforms of OPA1 protein levels in ChChd3 knockdown cells (Fig. 2C). No changes in levels of Mfn1 and Mfn2 were observed (data not shown). The increased fragmentation observed in ChChd3 knockdown cells could indicate either increased fission or decreased fusion in the absence of ChChd3. To distinguish these possibilities, we used the dominant negative mutant of the fission component DRP1, DRP1K38A. GFP-tagged DRP1 or D"
https://openalex.org/W2028191845,"FTY720 is a novel immunomodulating drug that can be phosphorylated inside cells; its phosphorylated form, FTY720-P, binds to a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor, S1P(1), and inhibits lymphocyte egress into the circulating blood. Although the importance of its pharmacological action has been well recognized, little is known about how FTY720-P is released from cells after its phosphorylation inside cells. Previously, we showed that zebrafish Spns2 can act as an S1P exporter from cells and is essential for zebrafish heart formation. Here, we demonstrate that human SPNS2 can transport several S1P analogues, including FTY720-P. Moreover, FTY720-P is transported by SPNS2 through the same pathway as S1P. This is the first identification of an FTY720-P transporter in cells; this finding is important for understanding FTY720 metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1966509827,"Protein arginine methylation plays a critical role in differential gene expression through modulating protein-protein and protein-DNA/RNA interactions. Although numerous proteins undergo arginine methylation, only limited information is available on how protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) identify their substrates. The human PRMT5 complex consists of PRMT5, WD45/MEP50 (WD repeat domain 45/methylosome protein 50), and pICln and catalyzes the symmetrical arginine dimethylation of its substrate proteins. pICln recruits the spliceosomal Sm proteins to the PRMT5 complex for methylation, which allows their subsequent loading onto snRNA to form small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. To understand how the PRMT5 complex is regulated, we investigated its biochemical composition and identified RioK1 as a novel, stoichiometric component of the PRMT5 complex. We show that RioK1 and pICln bind to PRMT5 in a mutually exclusive fashion. This results in a PRMT5-WD45/MEP50 core structure that either associates with pICln or RioK1 in distinct complexes. Furthermore, we show that RioK1 functions in analogy to pICln as an adapter protein by recruiting the RNA-binding protein nucleolin to the PRMT5 complex for its symmetrical methylation. The exclusive interaction of PRMT5 with either pICln or RioK1 thus provides the first mechanistic insight into how a methyltransferase can distinguish between its substrate proteins."

One such macro PARP, PARP-14 alters interleukin 4 (IL-4) and Stat6-dependent transcription. Stat6, activated by IL-4 plays an important role in T helper cell immunity and B cell responses. Here we define the mechanism by which PARP-14 regulates Stat6-activated transcription. Under non-stimulating conditions, PARP-14 recruits HDAC 2 and 3 to IL-4 responsive promoters. In the presence of IL-4, PARP-14 promotes efficient binding of Stat6 to its target genes.

The HDACs and PARP-14 get replaced by coactivators containing HAT activity. Based on these observations we put forth a mechanism in which PARP-14 functions as a transcriptional switch for Stat6-dependent gene induction. Thus, in the absence of a signal PARP-14 acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting HDACs.

Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). These proteins are implicated in a number of cellular processes including, DNA damage repair, transcription regulation, telomere cohesion, and energy metabolism (1Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 2Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The PARP domain catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose moieties from NAD to protein acceptors (1Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Recently, a new nomenclature for this family of proteins was proposed based on the structure of the catalytic domain, termed the ADP-ribosyltransferases diphtheria toxin-like (ARTD) family of proteins (3Hottiger M.O. Hassa P.O. Luscher B. Schuler H. Koch-Nolte F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 208-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Within the PARP/ARTD family, there are three members that contain macro domains. These domains were originally found in the non-classical histone macroH2A (mH2A) (4Ladurner A.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). One of these proteins, PARP-14/ARDT8/CoaSt6/BAL2 was shown to regulate interleukin-4 dependent transcription (6Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in both T and B cell function. IL-4 promotes naïve T cells to differentiate into the Th2 phenotype, which plays an important role in immunity against extracellular parasites, humoral immunity, and allergy. IL-4 also acts as growth factor for B cells and promotes immunoglobulin class switching (7Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). IL-4 uses the Jak-Stat pathway to mediate these functions, specifically it activates the transcription factor Stat6 (8Schindler C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Stat6 is found in the cell in its latent form, upon cytokine stimulation it is phosphorylated by the Jak kinases, this leads to dimerization and translocation of Stat6 to the nucleus where it binds to canonical DNA elements to induce transcription (9Wurster A.L. Tanaka T. Grusby M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In B cells, the targets of Stat6 include the germline epsilon (Iϵ, precursor for IgE) promoter and the gene for low affinity IgE Fc receptor (Fcer2a) (10Tinnell S.B. Jacobs-Helber S.M. Sterneck E. Sawyer S.T. Conrad D.H. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Stat6 recruits a number of coactivators at the promoter to activate transcription efficiently. These include HATs (histone acetyl transferase) such as, CBP/p300 and the nuclear coactivators (NCoA) (11Gingras S. Simard J. Groner B. Pfitzner E. Nucleic. Acids.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31105-31112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The protein p100 (TSN) has been shown to enhance Stat6-dependent transcription by bridging Stat6 to RNA polymerase II (16Yang J. Aittomäki S. Pesu M. Carter K. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Kieff E. Silvennoinen O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that PARP-14 potently and specifically enhances Stat6 dependent transcription (6Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The PARP catalytic domain found in PARP-14 is enzymatically active, and it uses NAD as a substrate to transfer ADP-ribose onto itself and p100 (17Goenka S. Cho S.H. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that this enzymatic activity of PARP-14 is required for its enhancement of Stat6-mediated transcription (17Goenka S. Cho S.H. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanism by which the ADP-ribosyl transferase reaction impacts Stat6 dependent transcription is not known. Here we provide evidence that PARP-14 is important for the binding of Stat6 to the promoter it activates. In addition to containing the PARP catalytic domain, PARP-14 contains three copies of the macro domains that were first identified in the non-classical histone macroH2A (mH2A) (5Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Like core histone H2A, mH2A is also associated with nucleosomes and replaces H2A in three percent of vertebrate nucleosomes (4Ladurner A.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). mH2A participates in the inactivation of the X chromosome (Xi) and depletion of mH2A in female cells results in the reactivation of genes on Xi (18Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 19Chadwick B.P. Valley C.M. Willard H.F. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2699-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that macro domains associate with histone deacetylases (HDACs). Thus, mH2A may participate in transcriptional repression by recruiting HDACs (20Chakravarthy S. Gundimella S.K. Caron C. Perche P.Y. Pehrson J.R. Khochbin S. Luger K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7616-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). All of these observations indicate that macro domains are transcription repressors rather than activators. It is possible that the macro domains found in PARP-14 may also function to repress transcription. However, we have shown that PARP-14 enhances Stat6-dependent transcription instead of repressing it (6Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To reconcile this paradox here we present evidence that PARP-14 does function as a repressor first by recruiting HDAC 2 and 3. However, in the presence of IL-4 the ADP-ribosyl transferase activity of PARP-14 is activated, which results in relieving its repressive function. 293T and M12 B cells were cultured in DMEM and RPMI, respectively, supplemented by 10% FBS as previously described (6Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Parp14−/− mice on a C57BL/6 background were a kind gift from Dr. Mark Boothby. 6–8-week-old mice were used for the entire study. Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free condition, and all studies were approved by Indiana University School of Medicine and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. B cells were isolated from spleens using the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer's protocol and cultured in IMDM-10% FBS. The cells were treated with 5–10 ng/ml of IL-4 (PeproTech), 10 or 50 μm PJ34 (Alexis Biochemicals) and 5 nm TSA (Sigma-Aldrich) as indicated in the figures. For the ChIP and expression analysis of the Iϵ gene, the cells were treated with 2 μg/ml anti-CD40 (BD Biosciences). The cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and quenched by adding 0.125 m glycine. The chromatin was sonicated to average length of 200–1000 bp. Samples were precleared with protein A beads and immunoprecipitated with anti-Stat6 (Santa Cruz Biotech), anti-PARP-14 (6Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), anti-HDAC2 (Santa Cruz Biotech), anti-HDAC3 (Santa Cruz Biotech), anti-acetyl H3 (Upstate Biotech), anti-acetyl H4 (Upstate Biotech), anti-p300 (Santa Cruz Biotech), anti-NCoA1 (Santa Cruz Biotech), anti-NCoA3 (Santa Cruz Biotech), or isotype control (Upstate Biotech). The immune complexes were collected on protein A beads, and the beads were washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer. Samples were treated with proteinase K and cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform and ethanol and analyzed for Fcer2a and ~Iϵ gene fragments by SYBR green qPCR. The specific primers used for PCR analysis are listed in supplemental Table S1. The immunoprecipitated fragments were expressed as a percentage of the total chromatin used in the sample. Cell extracts were prepared from M12 cells or 293T cells transfected with PARP-14 cDNA. 500 μg of protein extract were incubated with double-stranded biotinylated oligonucleotides corresponding to the Fcer2a and Iϵ promoter regions (supplemental Table S1) immobilized on streptavidin-agarose beads (Millipore) and 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA. The reaction was carried out for 2 h in pull-down buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 15 mm NaCL, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with pull-down buffer to remove nonspecific binding. The proteins bound to the oligonucleotides were then identified by Western blotting. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared using the SuperScript First-Strand cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) for Fcer2a and Iϵ transcripts was performed by the comparative threshold cycle method and normalized to Gapdh or Hprt. The primers used for these analyses are listed in supplemental Table S1. 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and whole cell extracts were prepared. 5 μg of the indicated antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation along with protein G beads. The immunoprecipitates were equally divided, resolved on SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes and probed with the indicated antibodies. GST-tagged proteins were expressed in the BL-21 bacterial strain and immobilized onto glutathione beads. These were then incubated with extracts from cells that were transfected with the indicated HDAC constructs. After 1 h of binding the beads were washed and the proteins bound to the beads were eluted in SDS-PAGE-loading dye and analyzed by Western blotting or Coomassie staining as indicated. M12 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids by electroporation as described previously (6Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells were divided and were untreated or treated with IL-4 for 24 h, and both luciferase and β-galactosidase assays (Promega) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. PARP assays were performed essentially as described earlier (17Goenka S. Cho S.H. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was performed with immunoprecipitated PARP-14 or its variants on protein G beads and in PARP reaction buffer (20 μl) containing 10 μCi of 32P-labeled NAD (800 Ci/mmol) (Perkin Elmer), 50 μm cold NAD, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by washing the beads with PBS and adding loading dye. To evaluate ADP-ribosylation, the proteins were then resolved on SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. Cells were fixed with 1.5% formaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 100% cold methanol for 10 min. The cells were then stained with PE-conjugated anti-pStat6 and FITC-conjugated anti-B220 (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry. It has been previously demonstrated that Stat6-dependent transcription is enhanced by PARP-14 and the enzymatic activity associated with it (6Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Goenka S. Cho S.H. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To further investigate the exact molecular mechanism by which ADP-ribosylation promotes Stat6 transcription, we tested the binding of Stat6 to IL-4-responsive promoters in the presence of a PARP inhibitor. The M12 B cell line was pretreated with PJ34, a PARP inhibitor for 30 min before incubation with IL-4. The binding of Stat6 to two IL-4 responsive promoters (Fcer2a and Iϵ) was then determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) at different intervals after IL-4 treatment. Stat6 binding to the Fcer2a promoter region was observed as early as 5-min post-IL-4 treatment. The maximum response was observed 30 min after the addition of IL-4. Importantly, pretreatment of cells with PJ34 resulted in reduced Stat6 binding to the Fcer2a promoter (Fig. 1A). A similar trend was observed for the Iϵ promoter (Fig. 1A). It is possible that the reduced binding of Stat6 to its promoter elements in the presence PJ34 was due to decreased Stat6 phosphorylation. To test the effect of inhibition of PARP activity on Stat6 phosphorylation we treated M12 cells similar to the ChIP experiments outlined above, and performed flow cytometric analysis with an antibody specific for phospho-Stat6. We did not observe any changes in the phosphorylation of Stat6 when the cells were treated with PJ34 (supplemental Fig. S1a). Taken together, these data indicate that PARP activity promotes the binding of Stat6 to targets genes independent of the proximal signaling events that activate Stat6. To evaluate if reduced Stat6 binding to the Fcer2a and Iϵ promoters in the presence of PJ34 resulted in a corresponding decrease in the expression of these genes, we performed quantitative RT-PCR for the Fcer2a and Iϵ transcripts. When cells were treated with IL-4, with increasing amounts of PJ34, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of Fcer2a and Iϵ induction (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that the maximal binding of Stat6 to the promoters it activates requires PARP activity, and this correlates to the level of transcription induced by Stat6. We have previously shown that ectopic expression of PARP-14 in M12 B cells results in the increased expression of CD23 (6Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To test whether the increase in CD23 expression in these M12 cell lines was due to increased Stat6 binding to its promoter element, we performed Stat6 ChIP experiments in the absence and presence of IL-4. Consistent with the increase in CD23 expression (6Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) we observed that there was increased binding of Stat6 to both Fcer2a and Iϵ promoters in cell lines overexpressing PARP-14 (C6-1 and C6-2) as compared with the controls (Fig. 1C and Ref. 6Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that the expression level of PARP-14 and the enzyme activity associated with it play an important role in the binding efficiency of Stat6 to its cognate promoter elements. PJ34 is a broad spectrum inhibitor of PARP catalytic activity and, thus, from the above experiments we are unable to determine the role PARP-14 specifically plays in the binding of Stat6 to the promoters it activates. Therefore, to determine if PARP-14 affects Stat6 binding to its cognate promoters, we performed ChIP experiments on B cells isolated from PARP-14 deficient animals (21Cho S.H. Goenka S. Henttinen T. Gudapati P. Reinikainen A. Eischen C.M. Lahesmaa R. Boothby M. Blood. 2009; 113: 2416-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and littermate controls with intact PARP-14 expression. As expected the binding of Stat6 to both the Fcer2a and Iϵ promoter region was observed after IL-4 treatment in B cells isolated from wild type mice (Fig. 1D). Similar to our observation with PJ34 treatment, lack of PARP-14 expression resulted in a significant decrease in the binding of Stat6 to both the Fcer2a and Iϵ promoters (Fig. 1D). Particularly, the binding of Stat6 to the Iϵ promoter was completely lost in the absence of PARP-14 expression (Fig. 1D, right panel). The IL-4-dependent phosphorylation of Stat6 in B cells with and without PARP-14 expression was compared by flow cytometric analysis and no differences were observed (supplemental Fig. S1b). These data are consistent with our previous results with PJ34 indicating that, neither PARP activity nor PARP-14 influences Stat6 phosphorylation. We further tested the expression of Fcer2a and Iϵ transcripts in WT and Parp14−/− mice that were left untreated or treated with the PARP inhibitor. As expected the expression of both transcripts were decreased in PARP-14-deficient animals as compared with WT (supplemental Fig. S2). Consistent with our Stat6 binding data, the Iϵ gene expression was more dependent on PARP-14. Fcer2a expression was more affected by the presence of PJ34 than the absence of PARP-14 suggesting that other PARP enzymes may also play a role in regulating Fcer2a. However, it seems unlikely that other PARPs are involved in regulating Iϵ, as PJ34 was unable to significantly reduce the expression of Iϵ in Parp14−/− B cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Taken together, these data indicate that the efficient binding of Stat6 to its promoter elements and therefore, the transcription competence is dependent on both the expression of PARP-14 and the enzyme activity associated with it. We have shown thus far that PARP-14 and the catalytic activity associated with it dictates the efficiency by which Stat6 binds to the promoter element it activates. However, it is not known whether PARP-14 regulates Stat6 mediated transcription indirectly or directly by binding to the same promoter DNA sequence as Stat6. To test the DNA binding capacity of PARP-14 we first performed DNA affinity precipitation assays (DAPA) with 50 bp biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the Fcer2a and Iϵ promoter region flanking the Stat6 binding site. Cell extracts from M12s treated in the presence or absence of IL-4 were incubated with the oligonucleotides immobilized on beads. After extensive washing of the beads, proteins bound to the oligonucleotides were probed with anti-Stat6. Treatment with IL-4 increased binding of Stat6 to both oligonucleotides (supplemental Fig. S3a). We performed similar experiments with 293T cell extracts transfected with PARP-14 or a vector control. A robust association of PARP-14 to both the promoter fragments was observed (supplemental Fig. S3b). These data indicate that PARP-14 associates with DNA that contains a Stat6 binding element. To investigate whether PARP-14 associates with native Stat6 responsive promoters we performed ChIP experiments with an antibody directed against PARP-14. M12 cells were treated with IL-4 for varying lengths of time and ChIPs were performed using anti-PARP-14 antibody, followed by qPCR to quantify DNA sequences corresponding to either, the Fcer2a and Iϵ promoters, or the coding sequences of these genes. We observed that under non-stimulating conditions PARP-14 associated with both of the Stat6 responsive promoters tested. Moreover, this association was lost when the cells were treated with IL-4 (Fig. 2A, black bars). PARP-14 was bound only to the promoter region of Fcer2a and Iϵ and not the coding region of these two genes (Fig. 2A, gray bars). These results indicate that PARP-14 regulates Stat6-mediated transcription by using a mechanism in which it is bound to the promoter in the absence of IL-4 and is no more required at the promoter in the presence of IL-4. To validate the specificity of the anti-PARP-14 antibody for our ChIP experiments, we isolated B cells from PARP-14-deficient animals and their wild-type littermates and performed similar ChIP experiments. Our data are consistent with our M12 studies where we observed that PARP-14 was associated with DNA in the absence of IL-4 and this association was lost upon IL-4 treatment (Fig. 2B, gray bars). Importantly, we observed no positive ChIP signal in PARP-14-deficient samples (Fig. 2B, black bars). Previously, we have shown that PARP-14 specifically enhances Stat6 but not Stat1-dependent gene induction (6Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next tested whether the association of PARP-14 under non-stimulating conditions was specific for Stat6-responsive promoters. Similar PARP-14 ChIP experiments were performed and the immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed for the presence of DNA elements corresponding to the Stat1-responsive Irf1 promoter and Stat4-responsive Il18r1 promoter (22Yu Q. Thieu V.T. Kaplan M.H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2052-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Thieu V.T. Yu Q. Chang H.C. Yeh N. Nguyen E.T. Sehra S. Kaplan M.H. Immunity. 2008; 29: 679-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous finding the association of PARP-14 was specific for Stat6-responsive genes and no association was observed for either, Stat1 or Stat4 responsive promoters (supplemental Fig. S3). Taken together, these results suggest that PARP-14 specifically participates in regulating Stat6 but not Stat1- or Stat4-responsive promoters. PARP-14 is bound to the promoter in the absence of a signal, and then in the presence of an activating signal, PARP-14 exits the promoter before transcription initiates. In the previous section we have shown that the PARP enzyme activity plays an important role in Stat6-dependent gene expression and, now we present evidence that PARP-14 disassociates from Stat6-responsive promoters upon IL-4 stimulation. Therefore, next we wanted to determine if the disassociation of PARP-14 from DNA was dependent on the PARP catalytic activity. To test this, cells were treated with a combination of IL-4 and PJ34 as indicated (Fig. 2C) and PARP-14 ChIPs were performed as before. PARP-14 was unable to disassociate from both the Fcer2a and Iϵ promoters upon IL-4 treatment in the presence of PJ34 (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that to regulate Stat6-dependent transcription PARP-14 uses a mechanism in which it leaves the promoter with a cytokine signal, and this function requires PARP enzymatic activity. Our finding that PARP-14 is associated with Stat6-responsive promoters in the absence of IL-4, and is disassociated following stimulation, suggests that PARP-14 may initially act as a repressor or recruit repressors to prevent transcription under non-stimulating conditions. However, in the presence of an appropriate signal the repressive function of PARP-14 may no longer be required and thus, it may need to disassociate from the promoter for transcription to be activated. As outlined in the introduction, PARP-14 contains three iterations of the macro domains, and similar macro domains found in macroH2A are known to associate with HDACs (20Chakravarthy S. Gundimella S.K. Caron C. Perche P.Y. Pehrson J.R. Khochbin S. Luger K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7616-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated if the class I HDACs, that are predominantly nuclear, associate with PARP-14. We co-expressed Flag-tagged HDAC and Myc-tagged PARP-14 in 293T cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. When the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag or an isotype control antibody we observed positive signals for HDAC 2 and 3 only with anti-Flag. Importantly, when the same immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-Myc we observed positive signals corresponding to the molecular weight of PARP-14 only in the anti-FLAG IPs (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that PARP-14 associates with HDAC 2 and 3. To test which regions of PARP-14 associated with HDAC 2 and 3, we performed pull-down experiments with the N (aa 1–813), middle (aa 800–1395), or C (aa 1389–1817) portion of PARP-14 (17Goenka S. Cho S.H. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) tagged with GST and HDAC 2 and 3. Bacterially expressed regions of PARP-14 tagged with GST or GST alone were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with cell extracts transfected with Flag-tagged HDAC 2 or 3. After extensive washing of the beads the bound proteins were subjected to Western blotting and probed with antibodies specific for the Flag epitope. GST by itself was unable to pull-down either HDAC 2 or 3. However, HDAC2 showed association with all three regions of PARP-14, and HDAC3 was brought down by the middle and C-terminal of PARP-14 (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data indicate that PARP-14 associates with HDAC 2 and 3 and the N-terminal and middle portion of PARP-14 participate in its ability to bind the two HDACs. Thus far, our data are consistent with a hypothesis that HDAC 2 and 3 through PARP-14 may repress Stat6-dependent transcription under non-stimulating conditions. If this was truly the case then we should observe the regulation of IL-4- and Stat6-dependent transcription by HDAC 2 and 3. To test this, M12 cells were co-transfected with a Stat6-responsive reporter construct and either, an empty vector, or one encoding HDAC 2 or 3. The transfected cells were treated with IL-4 or nothing and the reporter activity was determined. In the presence of both HDAC 2 and 3, the IL-4-mediated induction of the reporter was decreased by at least 50% (supplemental Fig. S4a). To further evaluate if HDACs play a role in IL-4-dependent gene induction we used an alternate approach. M12 cells were treated with a HDAC inhibitor, TSA (trichostatin A), the expression of Fcer2a and Iϵ transcripts was evaluated by qRT-PCR after IL-4 treatment. Both the Fcer2a and Iϵ transcripts were significantly increased in the presence of TSA (supplemental Fig. S4b). Our reporter assays along with the experiments with TSA strongly indicate that HDAC 2 and 3 regulate IL-4- and Stat6-dependent transcription. If HDAC 2 and"

PAP is phosphorylated at multiple Ser and Thr residues and is dephosphorylated for in vivo function by the Nem1p-Spo7p protein phosphatase complex localized in the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In this work, we characterized seven previously identified phosphorylation sites of PAP that are within the Ser/Thr-Pro motif. When expressed on a low copy plasmid, wild type PAP could not complement the pah1Δ mutant in the absence of the Nem1p-Spo7p complex. However, phosphorylation-deficient PAP (PAP-7A) containing alanine substitutions for the seven phosphorylation sites bypassed the requirement of the phosphatase complex and complemented the pah1Δ nem1Δ mutant phenotypes, such as temperature sensitivity, nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane expansion, decreased triacylglycerol synthesis, and derepression of INO1 expression. Subcellular fractionation coupled with immunoblot analysis showed that PAP-7A was highly enriched in the membrane fraction. In fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, the PAP-7A showed tighter association with phospholipid vesicles than wild type PAP. Using site-directed mutagenesis of PAP, we identified Ser(602), Thr(723), and Ser(744), which belong to the seven phosphorylation sites, as the sites phosphorylated by the CDC28 (CDK1)-encoded cyclin-dependent kinase. Compared with the dephosphorylation mimic of the seven phosphorylation sites, alanine substitution for Ser(602), Thr(723), and/or Ser(744) had a partial effect on circumventing the requirement for the Nem1p-Spo7p complex."

The mature form of the protein encompasses 616 amino acids, including 48 cysteine residues, which form the disulfide bridges responsible for its complex three-dimensional structure. THGP contains three epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains which mediate protein-protein interaction and a zona pellucida-like domain (2Devuyst O. Dahan K. Pirson Y. Nephrol.

Detailed studies on membrane trafficking and secretion of defective THGP have clearly established that THGP mutations cause a delayed export of mutant THGP to the plasma membrane, with increased storage of THGP in the ER. To date, about 40 distinct mutations have been reported in association with these so-called THGP storage disorders (15Bernascone I. Vavassori S. Di Pentima A. Santambrogio S. Lamorte G. Amoroso A.

More recently, in a genome-wide association study, the UMOD locus was identified as a major genetic susceptibility locus for chronic kidney disease (CKD), further emphasizing the importance of THGP in renal physiology (17Köttgen A.

Despite various advancements in the genetics of THGP, several physiological aspects, including the possible link between THGP and ion transport in TAL as suggested by salt wasting and hyperuricemia observed in patients with THGP mutations, remain enigmatic. One of the key players in the process of NaCl reabsorption along the TAL is the potassium channel ROMK, which resides in the apical membrane of TAL cells. Via recycling of potassium ions into the tubular lumen it forms a functional unit with the apical sodium potassium chloride co-transporter (NKCC2), the rate-limiting transport protein for NaCl reabsorption along the TAL. Disturbed ROMK function thus limits TAL salt reabsorption resulting in severe renal salt wasting as observed in Bartter syndrome type II (18Simon D.B. Karet F.E. Rodriguez-Soriano J. Hamdan J.H. DiPietro A. Trachtman H. Sanjad S.A. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Here we show that ROMK function is activated by THGP. Reduced ROMK activity thus might explain renal salt wasting in patients suffering from FJHN/MCKD-2/GCKD. Full-length hROMK2 was cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT/V5-His-TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Full-length hTHGP was cloned into pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) using HindIII and EcoR I sites. All full-length genes used for yeast two hybrid screening and direct interactions were cloned into membrane yeast two hybrid bait (pBT3C and pBT3N) and prey (pPR3C and pPR3N) vectors (MoBiTec Molecular Biotechnology, Göttingen, Germany) using SfiI sites, such that the insert is in-frame to the downstream and upstream reporter cassette respectively. All constructs (hROMK2, hTHGP, and hKir2.1), used for studies in Xenopus oocyte were cloned between the 5′- and 3′-UTR of the Xenopus β-globin gene in the modified pOG1 vector to increase expression efficiency. Chimeras were generated using overlap extension PCR method (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). For surface luminescence measurements, pOG1 vector with ROMK2 containing an external hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was used. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Strategene, Germany) was used to introduce HA epitope tag into the extracellular loop of ROMK2 at position 112. Both ends of the epitope were flanked by PGG residues to enhance accessibility and flexibility of the extracellular HA tag, creating a sequence, which reads E111PGGYPYDVPDYAGGP. Flp-In-293 cells (Invitrogen) were co-transfected with the recombinant pcDNA5/FRT/V5-His-TOPO TA vector containing the ROMK2 gene and the pOG44 plasmid expressing the Flp recombinase gene, as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated for 24 h to allow for expression of the hygromycin resistance gene, then selected and maintained in DMEM supplemented by fetal bovine serum (10%) and penicillin/streptomycin (1%) and hygromycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The resulting cells are described hereinafter as Flp-In-293/ROMK2 cells. ROMK2 expression in these cells was determined by electrophysiological measurements and Western blotting using anti-ROMK antibody (1:500) (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). The m-YTH screening assay (MoBiTec Molecular Biotechnology, Göttingen, Germany), was performed to identify proteins that interact with ROMK2. The pBT3N-ROMK2 and ROMK2-pBT3C bait vectors were used for screening. For direct interaction studies, prey vectors containing THGP were used. Identification of positive clones, recovery of library plasmids and identification of prey sequences were performed following the manufacturer's guidelines. In brief, Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain NMY51 was transformed with bait plasmids and the correct expression of the baits was verified by Western blot using LexA mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Verification of correct topology of the bait was performed using pAI-Alg5 and pDL2-Alg5 control preys, and the upper limit of selection stringency for screening was determined as SD -leu/-trp/-his/-ade (SD-LWHA) selection medium. The yeast strains expressing the baits were transformed with human kidney cDNA library (MoBiTec Molecular Biotechnology, Göttingen, Germany) for screening or with prey vectors for direct interaction studies. Protein-protein interaction was determined by growth on SD-LWHA plates. Positive colonies were further verified using the second marker β-galactosidase. The nucleotide sequence of the screened positives were determined by sequencing, and the identity of the encoded putative interacting protein was determined by database search (BLASTX). Immunoprecipitations were carried out using Immunoprecipitation kit, Dynabeads® protein G (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, protein G Dynabeads were coated with rabbit anti-THP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) under rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. Mouse kidneys were homogenized and subsequently lysed in 1× TBS Tween-20 buffer with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) for 30 min on ice. The lysates were then centrifuged, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. Alternatively, Triton X-100 lysates prepared from HEK-293 cells or Flp-In-293/ROMK2 cells, that stably express ROMK2, transfected with either GFP tagged THGP or empty GFP constructs, were used for immunoprecipitations. In order to eliminate antibody contamination in precipitated proteins, THGP antibody was cross linked to Dynabeads protein G using the cross linking agent BS3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody-coated beads were incubated with the lysates under rotation for 2–3 h at 4 °C. Dynabeads coated with antigen-antibody complex were washed extensively (4×) with the wash buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The proteins on Dynabeads were eluted by boiling at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS sample loading buffer and separated on a 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with either rabbit anti-THP antibody (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-ROMK2 antibody (1:500) (Almone). The membrane was washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000), and the bands were detected using the SuperSignal kit (Pierce). For Xenopus oocyte expression studies, complementary RNA (cRNA) was transcribed in vitro from Not1- or SacII-linearized plasmids containing the cDNA of interest using T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine T7 Kit, Ambion, Huntingdon, UK). cRNA was purified by LiCl/ethanol precipitation. Yield and concentration were quantified spectrophotometrically and the quality of RNA was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 50 nl of nuclease free water containing cRNA (10 pg/oocyte of ROMK2, Kir2.x, C1, or C2(R347A) alone or together with 10 ng/oocyte of THGP), and then stored at 16 °C in ND96 solution containing (mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1,8 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4), supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamycin and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate. 2–3 days following injection, two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements were performed at room temperature with a Gene Clamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City). To establish a resting membrane potential large enough to confirm oocyte viability and establishment of adequate voltage clamp, initial electrode impalements were made in standard ND96 solution. Membrane voltage was clamped over the range −100 to +60 mV in 20 mV steps. To obtain representative inward rectification, symmetrical potassium conditions were established by replacing the bath solution with KD96 solution containing (mm) 98 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1,8 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). K+ currents were recorded in bath solution containing KD96. Statistical analysis was performed on n = 10 oocytes derived from one preparation. The error bars in the diagrams indicate the S.E. Experiments were repeated in at least three different batches of oocytes derived from different frogs. Surface expression of HA-tagged ROMK2 in Xenopus oocytes was analyzed 2 days after injection with the cRNA (1 ng/oocyte of HA-tagged ROMK2 alone or together with 10 ng/oocyte of THGP). Oocytes were incubated for 30 min in ND96 solution containing 1% BSA at 4 °C to block nonspecific binding of antibodies. Subsequently, oocytes were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 1 mg/ml rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) in 1% BSA/ND96, washed 6× at 4 °C with 1% BSA/ND96 and incubated with 2 mg/ml peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified F(ab)2 fragment goat anti-rat immunoglobulinG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in 1% BSA/ND96 for 60 min. Oocytes were washed thoroughly, initially in 1% BSA/ND96 (at 4 °C for 60 min) and then in ND96 without BSA (at 4 °C for 15 min). Individual oocytes were placed in 20 μl SuperSignal Elisa Femto solution (Pierce, Chester, UK) and, after an equilibration period of 10 s, chemiluminescence was quantified in a luminometer (Lumat LB9507, Berthold Technologies, BadWildbad, Germany). For each construct surface expression of 15 oocytes was analyzed in one experiment, and at least three experiments (∼40 oocytes) were carried out. The luminescence produced by water injected oocytes or oocytes expressing WT-ROMK without HA epitope was used as a reference signal (negative control). Protein immunoblotting for oocyte experiments were performed to verify equal expression of all HA-tagged ROMK2 fusion proteins in Xenopus oocytes. Total protein was extracted from 10 oocytes for each construct as described previously (20Zuzarte M. Rinné S. Schlichthörl G. Schubert A. Daut J. Preisig-Müller R. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and subjected to protein electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked overnight at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% nonfat milk (NFM). Primary (rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:1000), Roche, Germany) and secondary (goat anti-rat HRP conjugate (1:5000), Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) antibodies were diluted in 5% NFM, incubated for 1 h each. Following each antibody incubation the membrane was washed for 10 min (3×) in TBS-T buffer. Bound antibodies were revealed using ECL plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences, UK). Wild-type C57/Bl6 mice and THGP−/− mice (n = 6) were bred in the local animal facility and kept on standard diet and tap water. For immunohistochemical studies, adult mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (0.06 mg/g body weight), their abdominal cavity was opened, and the kidneys were perfused retrogradely through the abdominal aorta using 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) dissolved in PBS. Kidneys were then removed and 5 μm-thick cryostat sections were prepared. Methods used were as described previously (21Schmitt R. Kahl T. Mutig K. Bachmann S. Histochem.

In brief, kidney cortices were excised and homogenized in buffer-I containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Diagnostics), and phosphatase inhibitors (phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1, Sigma) (pH 7.5). The homogenates were subjected to sequential centrifugation steps. Homogenates were centrifuged at 300 × g (10 min, 4 °C) to remove nuclei and whole cells. For preparation of membrane fractions, the resulting postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 17,000 × g (60 min, 4 °C) to obtain a pellet containing plasma membrane and membrane adherent vesicles (PM) and a supernatant (Ves+Cyt) containing the intracellular fraction with cytoplasmic and vesicular components. Following the removal of the large plasma membrane enriched pellet at 17,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h to obtain a vesicle-enriched pellet (Ves) and a supernatant containing cytoplasmic components (Cyt). Pellets containing the plasma membrane-enriched and vesicle-enriched fractions were dissolved in buffer-I and protein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 50 μg protein/lane were run on 8% polyacrylamide minigels. After electrophoretic transfer of the proteins, polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were incubated with the primary antibody against ROMK (1:500, Alomone) or flotillin-1 (1:1000, BD Biosciences) (Following stripping), each for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C and subsequent exposure to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected by exposure of x-ray films to chemiluminescence. The films were then scanned and evaluated densidometrically. ROMK immunoreactive signals obtained by analysis of plasma membrane-enriched fractions and vesicle-enriched fractions were normalized to flotillin-1 signals. Control blots containing PM, Ves+Cyt, Ves, and Cyt fractions were run and analyzed using primary antibodies against flotillin-1 (1:1000, BD Biosciences), β-actin (1:3000, Sigma), α-tubulin (1:2000, Sigma), and HSP-70 (1:3000, Sigma). Immunohistochemical double labeling procedures were performed using goat anti-THGP (1:500) (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa), rabbit anti-ROMK (1:500) (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel), and guinea pig anti-NKCC2 (1:1000) (kind gift from Dr. David Ellison, Portland, OR) primary antibodies. Cryosections were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min for better antigen retrieval and unspecific bindings were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS for 30 min. The primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk powder were sequentially applied for 1 h at room temperature, followed by application of appropriate secondary fluorescent Cy3-, Cy2-conjugated antibodies (1:300) (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) for 2 h. Sections were washed, coverslipped with PBS-glycerol, and analyzed in a Leica DMRB microscope equipped with a SPOT 32 camera and MetaView 3.6a software (Diagnostic Instruments; Universal Imaging) or a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM 5 Exciter). Data are reported as means ±S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. In the figures, statistically significant differences to control values are marked by asterisks (*, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.001; and ***, p < 0.0001); n.s indicates non-significant differences (p > 0.05). We performed a membrane yeast two-hybrid screen against a human kidney cDNA library, using ROMK2 as the bait with the C-terminal ubiquitin (Cub) fused to the N terminus of ROMK2 in one set and to the C terminus of ROMK2 in another set of screening (Fig. 1A, left). Screening over 1000 clones revealed THGP as a potential ROMK2-interacting protein. As expected, full-length THGP fused to the N-terminal ubiquitin (Nub) gave a positive interaction signal in the split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid assay upon expression with both the ROMK baits, yielding a his+/ade+/lacZ+ phenotype in the yeast NMY51 strain (Fig. 1A, right). To further verify ROMK2-THGP interaction, we performed co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As expected, immunostaining of mouse kidney sections revealed strong ROMK signal in the TAL and DCT and weak signal in CCD in both WT and THGP−/− animals (Fig. 6D). We observed a strong THGP signal in the TAL of wild-type mouse and absence of THGP signal in the THGP−/− mouse. Co-staining of mouse kidney sections resulted in partial co-localization of both ROMK and THGP signals in the luminal and ad-luminal membranes of wild-type mouse TAL-cells (Fig. 1B). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using total protein lysate extracted from mouse kidneys of both wild-type and THGP−/− animals. Indeed, we identified ROMK protein in the anti-THGP immunoprecipitate of wild-type animals, whereas no ROMK protein was detected in that of THGP−/− animals (Fig. 1C). In a separate batch of experiments we demonstrated that ROMK and THGP co-immunoprecipitated when heterologously expressed in mammalian cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using cell lysates from HEK-293 cell line stably expressing ROMK and transfected with either GFP tagged THGP or empty GFP (negative control). Furthermore, HEK-293 cell lysate was used to demonstrate anti-ROMK antibody specificity. We detected ROMK protein in the anti-THGP immunoprecipitate of HEK-293 cells expressing ROMK and GFP-tagged THGP whereas no ROMK protein was detected in the anti-THGP immunoprecipitate of HEK-293 cells expressing ROMK and empty GFP (Fig. 1D).FIGURE 6ROMK expression in THGP−/− mice. A, Western blots from the TAL cell extracts of WT and THGP−/− mice (n = 6 animals each) show specific bands for ROMK in the plasma membrane- and vesicle-enriched fractions. Corresponding control flotillin-1 blots for plasma membrane- and vesicle-enriched fractions are represented. B, representative Western blots from kidney homogenates of WT mouse (n = 6 animals) show specific bands for α-tubulin, β-actin, flotillin-1, and HSP-70 in the plasma membrane (PM; 17,000 × g, pellet), vesicle and cytosol- (Ves+Cyt; 17,000 × g, supernatant) cytosol (Cyt; 200,000 × g, supernatant) and vesicle-enriched fractions (200,000 × g, pellet). Note the nearly complete to absolute absence of signal for cytoskeleton (α-tubulin, β-actin) and cytosolic (HSP-70) proteins in membrane-enriched fractions, whereas membrane resident protein Flotillin-1 was mainly distributed in membrane-enriched fractions clearly demonstrating the purity of plasma membrane and vesicle preparations. C, densitometric analysis of Western blots with intensity values normalized to flotillin for plasma membrane- and vesicle-enriched fractions are plotted for both strains (n = 6, *, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.001 versus WT). D, confocal images show a sharp membrane staining of ROMK in the wild-type mice, whereas THGP−/− mice show a diffuse staining pattern of ROMK in the TAL tubules. TAL cells (*) were identified by co-staining for NKCC2, a sodium-potassium-chloride transporter specifically expressed along the TAL. ROMK staining in CCD cells (×) lacking expression of THGP and NKCC2 serves as a negative control. Phase contrast images of TAL and CCD for both WT and THGP−/− mice are provided in supplemental Fig. S3). All images are supplemented with scale bars (10 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the functional relevance of ROMK2 and THGP interaction we performed electrophysiological measurements in Xenopus oocytes with two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) analysis. In contrast to THGP, expression of ROMK2 induced measurable potassium currents with expected weak inward rectification. As shown in Fig. 2, A–C, expression of ROMK2 together with THGP significantly increased ROMK current amplitude in the order of ∼4-fold. Single channel recordings (see supplemental Fig. S1) suggested an increased surface expression of ROMK2 in the presence of THGP. We therefore investigated the effect of THGP on ROMK2 surface expression. To this end we employed hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ROMK2 to quantify ROMK surface expression in the absence and presence of THGP in Xenopus oocytes. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, HA-tagged ROMK2 yielded currents identical to those observed for the wild-type channel with comparable activation when expressed with THGP (data not shown). Expression of the extracellularly tagged ROMK2 construct in Xenopus oocytes revealed a robust luminescence signal when compared with oocytes expressing wild type ROMK2 without HA-epitope (data not shown). Upon co-expression with THGP we observed a nearly 3-fold increase in the surface expression of ROMK2 (Fig. 2, D and E). This increase in surface expression of ROMK2 protein therefore provided an explanation for the increased ROMK current amplitude in the presence of THGP. To check whether the effect of THGP is specific for ROMK2 (Kir"

Non-amyloidogenic processing of APP by α-secretases leads to proteolytic cleavage within the Aβ peptide sequence and shedding of the soluble APP ectodomain (sAPPα), which has been reported to be endowed with neuroprotective properties. In this work, we have shown that activation of the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) stimulates sAPPα release from mouse neuroblastoma cells expressing human APP, from human neuroblastoma cells and from mouse primary astrocytes or neural progenitor cells. sAPPα shedding is inhibited by P2X7R antagonists or knockdown of P2X7R with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and is not observed in neural cells from P2X7R-deficient mice. P2X7R-dependent APP-cleavage is independent of extracellular calcium and strongly inhibited by hydroxamate-based metalloprotease inhibitors, TAPI-2 and GM6001. However, knockdown of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-9 (ADAM9), ADAM10 and ADAM17 by specific siRNA, known to have α-secretase activity, does not block the P2X7R-dependent non-amyloidogenic pathway.

Although the drug has been assumed to act by preventing the up-regulation of proinflammatory enzymes, we probed here its direct chemical interaction with reactive oxygen species. The antibiotic did not react with superoxide or •NO radicals, but peroxynitrite (PON) was scavenged in the range of ∼1 μm minocycline and below. The interaction of pharmacologically relevant minocycline concentrations with PON was corroborated in several assay systems and significantly exceeded the efficacy of other antibiotics. Minocycline was degraded during the reaction with PON, and the resultant products lacked antioxidant properties. The antioxidant activity of minocycline extended to cellular systems, because it prevented neuronal mitochondrial DNA damage and glutathione depletion. Maintenance of neuronal viability under PON stress was shown to be solely dependent on direct chemical scavenging by minocycline. We chose α-synuclein (ASYN), known from Parkinsonian pathology as a biologically relevant target in chemical and cellular nitration reactions. Submicromolar concentrations of minocycline prevented tyrosine nitration of ASYN by PON. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that minocycline impeded nitrations more effectively than methionine oxidations and dimerizations of ASYN, which are secondary reactions under PON stress. Thus, PON scavenging at low concentrations is a novel feature of minocycline and may help to explain its pharmacological activity.

Since the mRen2.Lewis strain exhibits salt-dependent hypertension and early diastolic dysfunction, we assessed the effects of the GPER agonist (G-1, 40 nmol/kg/hr for 14 days) or vehicle (VEH, DMSO/EtOH) on cardiac function and structure.Intact female mRen2.Lewis rats were fed a normal salt (0.5% sodium; NS) diet or a high salt (4% sodium; HS) diet for 10 weeks beginning at 5 weeks of age.Prolonged intake of HS in mRen2.Lewis females resulted in significantly increased blood pressure, mildly reduced systolic function, and left ventricular (LV) diastolic compliance (as signified by a reduced E deceleration time and E deceleration slope), increased relative wall thickness, myocyte size, and mid-myocardial interstitial and perivascular fibrosis. G-1 administration attenuated wall thickness and myocyte hypertrophy, with nominal effects on blood pressure, LV systolic function, LV compliance and cardiac fibrosis in the HS group. G-1 treatment significantly increased LV lusitropy [early mitral annular descent (e')] independent of prevailing salt, and improved the e'/a' ratio in HS versus NS rats (P<0.05) as determined by tissue Doppler.Activation of GPER improved myocardial relaxation in the hypertensive female mRen2.Lewis rat and reduced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and wall thickness in those rats fed a high salt diet. Moreover, these advantageous effects of the GPER agonist on ventricular lusitropy and remodeling do not appear to be associated with overt changes in blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1988056003,"Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is a human pathogen that causes local suppurative infections and severe invasive diseases. Systemic dissemination of GAS is initiated by bacterial penetration of the epithelial barrier of the pharynx or damaged skin. To gain insight into the mechanism by which GAS penetrates the epithelial barrier, we sought to identify both bacterial and host factors involved in the process. Screening of a transposon mutant library of a clinical GAS isolate recovered from an invasive episode allowed identification of streptolysin S (SLS) as a novel factor that facilitates the translocation of GAS. Of note, the wild type strain efficiently translocated across the epithelial monolayer, accompanied by a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and cleavage of transmembrane junctional proteins, including occludin and E-cadherin. Loss of integrity of intercellular junctions was inhibited after infection with a deletion mutant of the sagA gene encoding SLS, as compared with those infected with the wild type strain. Interestingly, following GAS infection, calpain was recruited to the plasma membrane along with E-cadherin. Moreover, bacterial translocation and destabilization of the junctions were partially inhibited by a pharmacological calpain inhibitor or genetic interference with calpain. Our data indicate a potential function of SLS that facilitates GAS invasion into deeper tissues via degradation of epithelial intercellular junctions in concert with the host cysteine protease calpain."
https://openalex.org/W2015246310,"Septins belong to the GTPase superclass of proteins and have been functionally implicated in cytokinesis and the maintenance of cellular morphology. They are found in all eukaryotes, except in plants. In mammals, 14 septins have been described that can be divided into four groups. It has been shown that mammalian septins can engage in homo- and heterooligomeric assemblies, in the form of filaments, which have as a basic unit a hetero-trimeric core. In addition, it has been speculated that the septin filaments may serve as scaffolds for the recruitment of additional proteins.Here, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens with human septins 1-10, which include representatives of all four septin groups. Among the interactors detected, we found predominantly other septins, confirming the tendency of septins to engage in the formation of homo- and heteropolymeric filaments.If we take as reference the reported arrangement of the septins 2, 6 and 7 within the heterofilament, (7-6-2-2-6-7), we note that the majority of the observed interactions respect the ""group rule"", i.e. members of the same group (e.g. 6, 8, 10 and 11) can replace each other in the specific position along the heterofilament. Septins of the SEPT6 group preferentially interacted with septins of the SEPT2 group (p<0.001), SEPT3 group (p<0.001) and SEPT7 group (p<0.001). SEPT2 type septins preferentially interacted with septins of the SEPT6 group (p<0.001) aside from being the only septin group which interacted with members of its own group. Finally, septins of the SEPT3 group interacted preferentially with septins of the SEPT7 group (p<0.001). Furthermore, we found non-septin interactors which can be functionally attributed to a variety of different cellular activities, including: ubiquitin/sumoylation cycles, microtubular transport and motor activities, cell division and the cell cycle, cell motility, protein phosphorylation/signaling, endocytosis, and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2081929782,"In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the enzyme PafA is responsible for the activation and conjugation of the proteasome-targeting molecule Pup to protein substrates. As the proteasomal pathway has been shown to be vital to the persistence of M. tuberculosis, understanding the reaction mechanism of PafA is critical to the design of antituberculous agents. In this study, we have developed novel techniques to study the activity of PafA and have characterized fundamental features of the reaction mechanism. We show that PafA catalyzes a two-step reaction mechanism proceeding through a γ-glutamyl phosphate-mixed anhydride intermediate that is formed on the C-terminal glutamate of Pup before transfer of Pup to the substrate acceptor lysine. SDS-PAGE analysis of formation of the phosphorylated intermediate revealed that the rate of Pup activation matched the maximal steady-state rate of product formation in the overall reaction and suggested that Pup activation was rate-limiting when all substrates were present at saturating concentrations. Following activation, both ADP and the phosphorylated intermediate remained associated with the enzyme awaiting nucleophilic attack by a lysine residue of the target protein. The PafA reaction mechanism appeared to be noticeably biased toward the stable activation of Pup in the absence of additional substrate and required very low concentrations of ATP and Pup relative to other carboxylate-amine/ammonia ligase family members. The bona fide nucleophilic substrate PanB showed a 3 orders of magnitude stronger affinity than free lysine, promoting Pup conjugation to occur close to the rate limit of activation with physiologically relevant concentrations of substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2065865744,"BST-2/tetherin is a host antiviral molecule that functions to potently inhibit the release of enveloped viruses from infected cells. In return, viruses have evolved antagonists to this activity. BST-2 traps budding virions by using two separate membrane-anchoring regions that simultaneously incorporate into the host and viral membranes. Here, we detailed the structural and biophysical properties of the full-length BST-2 ectodomain, which spans the two membrane anchors. The 1.6-Å crystal structure of the complete mouse BST-2 ectodomain reveals an ∼145-Å parallel dimer in an extended α-helix conformation that predominantly forms a coiled coil bridged by three intermolecular disulfides that are required for stability. Sequence analysis in the context of the structure revealed an evolutionarily conserved design that destabilizes the coiled coil, resulting in a labile superstructure, as evidenced by solution x-ray scattering displaying bent conformations spanning 150 and 180 Å for the mouse and human BST-2 ectodomains, respectively. Additionally, crystal packing analysis revealed possible curvature-sensing tetrameric structures that may aid in proper placement of BST-2 during the genesis of viral progeny. Overall, this extended coiled-coil structure with inherent plasticity is undoubtedly necessary to accommodate the dynamics of viral budding while ensuring separation of the anchors."

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of nuclear receptors that act as transcription factors for regulating energy balance in lipid and glucose homeostasis (17Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). The receptor family is composed of three isotypes: α, γ, and δ. PPARα is expressed mainly in brown adipose tissue and liver, but it is also present in the heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle (18Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). PPARγ is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue where it plays key roles in adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis (18Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W.

Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). In relation to their DNA binding, ligand binding, and cofactor binding domains, the PPARs share a high degree of structural homology with other nuclear hormone receptors (20Michalik L. Auwerx J.

The PPARs function by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) and transduce intracellular signals when ligands bind to the dimerized complex. The PPARα/RXRα heterodimer activates gene expression by binding to a cis-element, known as peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE), in the target gene promoter. Studies from PPARα-null mice showed that PPARα regulates genes involved in lipid metabolism in the liver, including fatty acid uptake (21Hsu M.H. Savas U. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol.

Furthermore, PPARα-null mice show severe hypoglycemia following 24-h fasting, characterized by a 50% drop in blood glucose level, suggesting a potential role of PPARα in glucose homeostasis and metabolism (29Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Although the synergistic effect of PPARα with glucocorticoid receptor on PEPCK promoter has been studied in liver (30Cassuto H. Kochan K. Chakravarty K. Cohen H. Blum B. Olswang Y. Hakimi P. Xu C. Massillon D. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33873-33884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and several mechanisms accounting for reduced glucose production in PPARα-null mice were proposed (23Patsouris D. Mandard S. Voshol P.J. Escher P. Tan N.S. Havekes L.M. Koenig W. März W. Tafuri S. Wahli W. Müller M. Kersten S. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), little is known about direct role of PPARα on the regulation of the gene expression of G6Pase. In this study, we have identified and characterized PPRE in the promoter region of G6Pase gene using luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Additionally, we showed that G6Pase gene expression was down-regulated in the PPARα-null mice and up-regulated in livers of fasting and db/db mice. These findings indicate that G6Pase is a direct target of PPARα and that PPARα may be responsible for glucose production through the regulation of hepatic G6Pase gene expression during fasting as well as in T2DM. Mice were housed with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. All animals were fed a regular chow diet until the fasting and refeeding treatment started. For the dietary manipulation study, each group of four male C57BL/6J or PPARα-null mice was tested. For fasting group, mice were fasted for 24 h during a light and dark cycle. For the refeeding group, the mice fasted for 24 h were refed with a high carbohydrate meal for 12 h under the dark cycle. All mice were killed at the same time which is just after the finish time of the dark cycle. PPARα-null mice were a generous gift from Frank J. Gonzalez (31Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). C57BL/6J male mice for wild-type and db/db male mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratory. A standard diet and a high carbohydrate/fat-free diet were purchased from Harlem Teklad Co. (Madison, WI). The animal experiments were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Yonsei University College of Medicine. Wy14,643 (Sigma-Aldrich) and fenofibrate (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as PPARα ligands. Dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the glucocorticoid receptor ligand. Blood glucose drawn from mouse tail vein was analyzed using a glucose monitor, One Touch Sure Step (Lifescan). Plasma insulin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (ALPCO, Salem, NH). A HepG2 human hepatoma cell line was maintained in high glucose (25 mm) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Hyclone, South Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Hyclone). Cells were grown at 37 °C/5% CO2 humidified incubator. Primary hepatocytes isolated from C57BL/6J mice liver were plated and cultured for 6 h in DMEM high glucose containing 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 nm dexamethasone, and 10 nm insulin. And then, FBS, dexamethasone, and insulin were excluded from the medium and cultured for an additional 16 h in the presence or absence of Wy14,643, fenofibrate, dexamethasone, or cAMP. Total RNA was isolated from the mice liver using the easy spin RNA extraction kit (iNtRON) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription and qPCR analysis were performed as described in our previous study (32Kim T.H. Kim H. Park J.M. Im S.S. Bae J.S. Kim M.Y. Yoon H.G. Cha J.Y. Kim K.S. Ahn Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15071-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Relative gene expression was determined by the standard curve methods. Ribosomal protein, large, p0 (Rplp0) was used as an internal control for RNA quality and quantity. For qPCR amplification, the following gene-specific PCR primers were used: 5′-TGGTAGCCCTGTCTTTCTTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCCAGCATTCACACTTTCCT-3′ (antisense) for G6Pase; 5′-ACACACACACATGCTCACAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATCACCGCATAGTCTCTGAA-3′ (antisense) for PEPCK; 5′-TGCCAAGGAGTCGAGGATGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCGGCACCAGGAACCAA-3′ (antisense) for PPARα; 5′-CTGTTAGCAGGATGGCAGCTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTTCCTGGAGAGATGCTGTGG-3′ (antisense) for glucokinase (Gck); 5′-ATCTGGTGATTGTG GTGACAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGGTGTGGGTTGAAAGAAA-3′ (antisense) for liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK); 5′-ACAAACGATGACCCTCCTCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTGGGGTCAGAGGAAGAG-3′ (antisense) for PGC-1α; 5′-GCAGGTGTTTGACAACGGCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATGATGGAGTGTGGCACCGA-3′ (antisense) for Rplp0. Proteins isolated from the mice liver using the radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Whatman). The membrane was blocked with nonfat skim milk and agitated with PPARα, G6Pase, and GAPDH antibodies that were purchased from Millipore (mAb 3890), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-27198), and Cell Signaling (2118), respectively. The signals were detected with LAS-3000 (Fuji). Promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were constructed by amplifying the promoter region of pmG6Pase (−1188/+66) from mouse genomic DNA by PCR and inserting them into the pGL4.14 vector (pGL4.14; Promega). Serial deletion constructs from G6Pase promoter construct were prepared by amplifying the indicated regions and subcloned in the pGL4.14 vector. The PPRE point mutation was introduced into the putative PPARα binding site in pmG6Pase (−1188/+66) construct by displacing PPRE with EcoRV restriction sites to generate mutant PPRE. To exclude the length effects of individual promoters, luciferase activities of each promoter reporter which were co-transfected with pcDNA3 in the absence of ligand were artificially defined as 1. HepG2 cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 1 ml of medium. Transient transfections were performed as described previously (32Kim T.H. Kim H. Park J.M. Im S.S. Bae J.S. Kim M.Y. Yoon H.G. Cha J.Y. Kim K.S. Ahn Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15071-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were transiently co-transfected with firefly luciferase fusion genes containing each serially deleted mouse G6Pase promoter sequence from −1188 to +66 and expression vectors encoding Renilla luciferase and either empty pcDNA3 vector or the same vector encoding the murine form of Pparα. After 24 h, media were changed to medium with or without 20 μm Wy14,643. After ligand treatment, cells were incubated for 24 h and then harvested for luciferase activity measurements. The following primers were used for making PPRE mutation: sense, 5′-GTCGATATCTTTGGGCTGGATTGACCTACAG-3′; antisense, 5′-TGAGATATCGACTCAAAAAACCACTTTTGTC-3′. Human PEPCK (−599/+61) and Gck (−1000/+158) promoters were amplified from human genomic DNA, respectively. For the mouse ChIP assay, equal amounts of freshly isolated livers from mice were pooled and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin, 2.0 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA). The tissue was disrupted in IKA T10 basic homogenizer (WAG) at a low setting. Formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v), and samples were rotated for 8 min. A ChIP assay was performed on cells collected by centrifugation at 400 × g with an Upstate assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA was recovered from eluted DNA-protein complex and purified by using Qiagen PCR purification kit. The purified DNA was amplified by qPCR and determined by comparative ΔΔCT method in using primers appropriated for each set as follows: 5′-GCTGTTTTTGTGTGCCTGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGCTATCAGTCTGTGCCTTG-3′ (antisense) for G6Pase PPRE-ChIP; 5′-GATCGCTGACCTCAGAGACA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCACCAATGCACATGAGAT-3′ (antisense) for G6Pase outside PPRE-ChIP in mouse. The relative amount of the precipitated target sequence was determined via normalization to the 1% of purified total genomic DNA input. Three to five experiments of all studies were performed, using triplicate replications. The data are represented as mean ± S.E. All datasets were analyzed for statistical significance using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. All p values below 0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS (Version 11.5; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). PPARα-null mice are characterized by defects in fatty acid oxidation and hypoglycemia during fasting (29Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 31Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar, 33Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). To explore a molecular mechanism governing the PPARα and gluconeogenic gene expression, mRNA levels of PPARα, G6Pase, and PEPCK were measured in the mice subjected to fasting and/or refeeding. During the fasting period, PPARα mRNA levels were increased in the liver of wild-type mice and decreased by refeeding (Fig. 1A). PPARα protein was also increased by fasting and decreased by refeeding (Fig. 1B). PPARα protein was not increased in the liver of PPARα-null mice regardless of dietary condition. mRNA levels of G6Pase (Fig. 1C) and PEPCK (Fig. 1D) were elevated during fasting and returned to control levels in the livers of refed wild-type mice. However, mRNA levels of G6Pase and PEPCK were not increased by fasting in the PPARα-null mice, suggesting that PPARα could be involved in the up-regulation of G6Pase and PEPCK gene expression. Because PPARα is shown to mediate adaptive response to fasting (29Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), the serum blood glucose level may be lower in PPARα-null mice during fasting due to decreased gluconeogenesis in liver. Indeed, the serum glucose level was decreased in fasted PPARα-null mice compared with wild-type control mice (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, the serum insulin level was not increased in PPARα-null mice by refeeding (Fig. 1F), and this result is consistent with the report that PPARα plays a role in the insulin secretion in pancreas (34Bihan H. Rouault C. Reach G. Poitout V. Staels B. Guerre-Millo M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Analysis of diet-sensitive gene expression levels showed that Gck and L-PK were not affected in the livers of fasting wild-type and PPARα-null mice (Fig. 1, G and H). However, Gck and L-PK expression was not induced by refeeding due to decreased insulin secretion probably in PPARα-null mice (Fig. 1, G and H). This phenomenon might be closely associated with decreased plasma insulin level in the refed PPARα-null mice. PGC-1α, which acts as a co-activator of several transcription factors, is induced in fasting liver as well (35Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). To test whether a deficiency of PPARα could affect expression of the PGC-1α gene, we measured PGC-1α mRNA levels in each dietary condition. The mRNA level of PGC-1α in PPARα-null mice was similar to that of wild-type mice (Fig. 1I). To observe the effects of PPARα agonists on the gluconeogenic gene expression, primary cultured hepatocytes isolated from C57BL/6J mice were treated with Wy14,643 or fenofibrate. G6Pase mRNA levels were increased by Wy14,643 and fenofibrate treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and C). However, both PPARα agonists slightly increased the PEPCK mRNA level (Fig. 2, B and D), and mRNA levels of PPARα and PGC-1α were not affected by Wy14,643 and fenofibrate treatment (supplemental Fig. 1, A–D). Because glucocorticoid is known to up-regulate gluconeogenic genes (36Barthel A. Schmoll D. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E685-E692Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 37Bernal-Mizrachi C. Weng S. Feng C. Finck B.N. Knutsen R.H. Leone T.C. Coleman T. Mecham R.P. Kelly D.P. Semenkovich C.F. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we evaluated the effects of dexamethasone, cAMP, and/or Wy14.643 on G6Pase gene expression in the primary cultured hepatocytes (Fig. 2, E and F). Dexamethasone and Wy14,643 synergistically increased G6Pase and PEPCK expression. Time course experiments showed that the Wy14,643 effect on G6Pase gene expression was maximum at the 24-h incubation time (Fig. 2E). A computer search for putative PPRE in the G6Pase gene suggested that the cis-element could be located in the −76 bp/−64 bp region and the sequence is evolutionally conserved in human, mouse, and rat (Fig. 3A). To localize the putative PPRE in the G6Pase gene, serial deletion constructs were prepared, and their responsiveness to PPARα was tested. As shown in Fig. 3B, PPARα increased G6Pase promoter activity (pmG6Pase pro, −1188/+66) by 4.5-fold. The promoter activity was significantly decreased when the promoter was deleted down to −52 bp, suggesting that a putative PPRE could be present between −88 bp and −52 bp. To identify the PPRE site on the promoter, a PPRE mutation was introduced in the G6Pase promoter (−1188/+66) using site-directed mutagenesis. The promoter activity of mG6Pase-PPREmut by PPARα was significantly decreased (Fig. 3C), suggesting a direct participation of PPARα in the up-regulation of the G6Pase gene. In addition, PPARα also induced PEPCK promoter activity. However, Gck promoter activity was not affected by PPARα (supplemental Fig. 2A). To confirm that PPARα binds directly to the mouse G6Pase gene promoter region in vivo, a ChIP assay was performed. Fragmented chromatin was immunoprecipitated by anti-PPARα antibodies followed by qPCR amplifications, containing G6Pase-PPRE (Fig. 3D). The region outside the PPRE target region was chosen as a negative control (Fig. 3G). As shown in Fig. 3E, the binding of PPARα to the putative PPRE of the G6Pase promoter was increased in liver of the fasting group, consistent with data shown in Fig. 1C. In contrast, PPARα protein was not recruited in the fasted PPARα-null mice. These results indicate that PPARα binding to the putative PPRE of the G6Pase promoter is active under fasting condition. FoxO1 binding to G6Pase promoter, which is used as a positive control of transcription factor binding, was increased during the fasting state of both wild-type and PPARα-null mice (Fig. 3F). Gluconeogenesis occurs actively in the livers of patients with T2DM and in T2DM animal models (38Memon R.A. Tecott L.H. Nonogaki K. Beigneux A. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4021-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PPARα expression is known to be increased in the liver of diabetic animals (39Asayama K. Sandhir R. Sheikh F.G. Hayashibe H. Nakane T. Singh I. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 194: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because our data suggested that G6Pase might be a target of PPARα, we measured the mRNA levels of G6Pase and PEPCK in db/db mice. As shown in Fig. 4A, mRNA levels of G6Pase and PEPCK were significantly increased by 3.2-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively, in db/db mice compared with the control mice. To confirm that PPARα binding to the putative PPRE in the G6Pase promoter was increased in the diabetic db/db animal model, we performed a ChIP assay using an anti-PPARα antibody. PPARα binding to the putative PPRE is increased compared with control mice (Fig. 4B). To check PPARα and G6Pase protein levels in the diabetic mice model, an immunoblotting assay was performed using anti-PPARα and anti-G6Pase antibodies. PPARα as well as G6Pase protein levels were increased in liver of db/db mice (Fig. 4C). Glucose and insulin levels of db/db mice showed hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (Fig. 4, D and E). These results indicated that PPARα-mediated activation of G6Pase expression may contribute to the increased hepatic glucose production in db/db mice. Gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver of animals when they are subjected to long term fasting (40Cherrington A.D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1198-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) or in a diabetic state (41Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). Because PPARα plays an important role as a lipid sensor and regulator of cellular energy metabolism, fatty acid-mediated PPARα activation is critical in fatty acid and lipid metabolism (42Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar, 43Lefebvre P. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Although human inborn errors of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation are asymptomatic in a normal feeding condition, these patients show hypoketotic hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, intracellular accumulation of neutral lipid in liver and heart, and sudden death in a short term fasting condition (44Roe C.R. Coates P.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.I. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1501-1533Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of the symptoms is not well understood, however, possible causes include: 1) an inadequate energy supply in the heart, which uses mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids as the main source of energy, and 2) toxic effects of elevated intracellular concentrations of the intermediary metabolites of fatty acids (45Kelly D.P. Strauss A.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These characteristics are partially similar to PPARα-deficient mice subjected to dietary fasting (29Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-149"
https://openalex.org/W2077856783,"Polar auxin movement is a primary regulator of programmed and plastic plant development. Auxin transport is highly regulated at the cellular level and is mediated by coordinated transport activity of plasma membrane-localized PIN, ABCB, and AUX1/LAX transporters. The activity of these transporters has been extensively analyzed using a combination of pharmacological inhibitors, synthetic auxins, and knock-out mutants in Arabidopsis. However, efforts to analyze auxin-dependent growth in other species that are less tractable to genetic manipulation require more selective inhibitors than are currently available. In this report, we characterize the inhibitory activity of 5-alkoxy derivatives of indole 3-acetic acid and 7-alkoxy derivatives of naphthalene 1-acetic acid, finding that the hexyloxy and benzyloxy derivatives act as potent inhibitors of auxin action in plants. These alkoxy-auxin analogs inhibit polar auxin transport and tropic responses associated with asymmetric auxin distribution in Arabidopsis and maize. The alkoxy-auxin analogs inhibit auxin transport mediated by AUX1, PIN, and ABCB proteins expressed in yeast. However, these analogs did not inhibit or activate SCFTIR1 auxin signaling and had no effect on the subcellular trafficking of PIN proteins. Together these results indicate that alkoxy-auxins are inactive auxin analogs for auxin signaling, but are recognized by PIN, ABCB, and AUX1 auxin transport proteins. Alkoxy-auxins are powerful new tools for analyses of auxin-dependent development. Polar auxin movement is a primary regulator of programmed and plastic plant development. Auxin transport is highly regulated at the cellular level and is mediated by coordinated transport activity of plasma membrane-localized PIN, ABCB, and AUX1/LAX transporters. The activity of these transporters has been extensively analyzed using a combination of pharmacological inhibitors, synthetic auxins, and knock-out mutants in Arabidopsis. However, efforts to analyze auxin-dependent growth in other species that are less tractable to genetic manipulation require more selective inhibitors than are currently available. In this report, we characterize the inhibitory activity of 5-alkoxy derivatives of indole 3-acetic acid and 7-alkoxy derivatives of naphthalene 1-acetic acid, finding that the hexyloxy and benzyloxy derivatives act as potent inhibitors of auxin action in plants. These alkoxy-auxin analogs inhibit polar auxin transport and tropic responses associated with asymmetric auxin distribution in Arabidopsis and maize. The alkoxy-auxin analogs inhibit auxin transport mediated by AUX1, PIN, and ABCB proteins expressed in yeast. However, these analogs did not inhibit or activate SCFTIR1 auxin signaling and had no effect on the subcellular trafficking of PIN proteins. Together these results indicate that alkoxy-auxins are inactive auxin analogs for auxin signaling, but are recognized by PIN, ABCB, and AUX1 auxin transport proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2000613586,"The important roles of plant-soil microbe interactions have been documented in exotic plant invasion, but we know very little about how soil mutualists enhance this process (i.e. enhanced mutualism hypothesis). To test this hypothesis we conducted two greenhouse experiments with Solidago canadensis (hereafter Solidago), an invasive forb from North America, and Stipa bungeana (hereafter Stipa), a native Chinese grass. In a germination experiment, we found soil microbes from the rhizospheres of Solidago and Stipa exhibited much stronger facilitative effects on emergence of Solidago than that of Stipa. In a growth and competition experiment, we found that soil microbes strongly facilitated Solidago to outgrow Stipa, and greatly increased the competitive effects of Solidago on Stipa but decreased the competitive effects of Stipa on Solidago. These findings from two experiments suggest that in situ soil microbes enhance the recruitment potential of Solidago and its ability to outcompete native plants, thereby providing strong evidence for the enhanced mutualism hypothesis. On the other hand, to some extent this outperformance of Solidago in the presence of soil microbes seems to be unbeneficial to control its rapid expansion, particularly in some ranges where this enhanced mutualism dominates over other mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2059175123,"A lepidopteran insect cell-based expression system has been employed to express three Anopheles gambiae odorant receptors (ORs), OR1 and OR2, which respond to components of human sweat, and OR7, the ortholog of Drosophila's OR83b, the heteromerization partner of all functional ORs in that system. With the aid of epitope tagging and specific antibodies, efficient expression of all ORs was demonstrated and intrinsic properties of the proteins were revealed. Moreover, analysis of the orientation of OR1 and OR2 on the cellular plasma membrane through the use of a novel ‘topology screen’ assay and FACS analysis demonstrates that, as was recently reported for the ORs in Drosophila melanogaster, mosquito ORs also have a topology different than their mammalian counterparts with their N-terminal ends located in the cytoplasm and their C-terminal ends facing outside the cell. These results set the stage for the production of mosquito ORs in quantities that should permit their detailed biochemical and structural characterization and the exploration of their functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W2147409322,"We present here a study of a eukaryotic trans-prenylsynthase from the malaria pathogen Plasmodium vivax. Based on the results of biochemical assays and contrary to previous indications, this enzyme catalyzes the production of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) rather than farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Structural analysis shows that the product length is constrained by a hydrophobic cavity formed primarily by a set of residues from the same subunit as the product as well as at least one other from the dimeric partner. Furthermore, Plasmodium GGPP synthase (GGPPS) can bind nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) strongly with the energetically favorable cooperation of three Mg2+, resulting in inhibition by this class of compounds at IC50 concentrations below 100 nm. In contrast, human and yeast GGPPSs do not accommodate a third magnesium atom in the same manner, resulting in their insusceptibility to N-BPs. This differentiation is in part attributable to a deviation in a conserved motif known as the second aspartate-rich motif: whereas the aspartates at the start and end of the five-residue motif in FFPP synthases and P. vivax GGPPSs both participate in the coordination of the third Mg2+, an asparagine is featured as the last residue in human and yeast GGPPSs, resulting in a different manner of interaction with nitrogen-containing ligands.

Isoprenoids make up the largest family of natural products and drugs derived from the five-carbon isoprene subunit. As precursors to steroids and sterols, they are utilized by prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike to modify proteins, such as G proteins, kinases, and phosphatases, and facilitate their localization to membranes. The production of isoprenoids begins with the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) 2The abbreviations used are: IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate; A-BP, alkylbisphosphonate; CLD, chain length-determining; CpNPPPS, Cryptosporidium parvum nonspecific polyprenyl pyrophosphate synthase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; FARM, first aspartate-rich motif; FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; FPPS, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; GGPPS, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase; HsFPPS, human FPPS; HsGGPPS, human GGPPS; IBAN, ibandronate; N-BP, nitrogen-containing bisphosphate; PDB, Protein Data Bank; PvGGPPS, Plasmodium vivax GGPPS; RIS, risedronte; SARM, second aspartate-rich motif; ScGGPPS, Saccharomyces cerevisiae GGPPS; TCEP, 1,2,3-tris(2-cyanoethoxy)propane; ZOL, zoledronate. and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) via either the mevalonate or nonmevalonate pathway. In most organisms, the first functionally significant product is farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Condensation of FPP with another IPP molecule generates geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which in turn begets successively longer isoprenoids as products of similar reactions constituting a multistep biopolymerization process. Chemists have designed numerous pyrophosphate analogs, including bisphosphonates, which feature substitution of oxygen by carbon as a phosphate linker. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) have specifically been developed for bone diseases, targeting farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) (1Dunford J.E. Kwaasi A.A. Rogers M.J. Barnett B.L.

Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (Merck) spotted with reaction mixture were developed with propan-2-ol, ammonia, and water in a ratio of 9:3:1. Samples were identified by comparison with known standards and were visualized by staining with iodine vapor. PvGGPPS was crystallized in its apo form by mixing 1.5 μl of protein (at 16.5 mg/ml concentration in a buffer of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl) with 1.5 μl of reservoir solution consisting of 22% PEG 3350, 200 mm Li2SO4, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, in a hanging drop vapor diffusion setup with >350 μl of reservoir solution at 18 °C in VDXm plates (Hampton Research).

The data for ZOL-incubated crystals were collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS), beam F1. Complete datasets were collected using 0.5° oscillations, and a total of 180° were collected. Native crystals diffracted to a maximum of 2.1 Å. The GGPP and ZOL crystals both diffracted to 2.5 Å, respectively. The native structure solution was obtained by molecular replacement using the program PHASER and Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1UBV (Gallus gallus FPPS) as a model. Both ligand structures were subsequently solved using the original native PDB model as reference in PHASER. Initial maps from the molecular replacement for both sets showed obvious density for the ligands. All datasets and models were refined using REFMAC5 and the CCP4 package of programs.

These residues are both bulky in a specific FPPS and both small in GGPPS from humans, yeast, and Entamoeba. On the other hand, the reportedly bifunctional Toxoplasma FPPS (16Ling Y. Li Z.H.

Interestingly, both Plasmodium enzymes also have a similarly mixed pair in this position. Also distinctive is the asparagine in the fifth position in the SARM within HsGGPPS and ScGGPPS, where aspartate is present in all the other enzymes.

In the Plasmodium enzymes as well as all FPPSs, an aspartate occupies the fifth position of SARM, where both human and yeast GGPPS feature asparagine. We successfully expressed the P. vivax enzyme using an Escherichia coli-based expression platform proven to be effective for a significant number of apicomplexan proteins (19Vedadi M. Lew J. Artz J.

This discrepancy may be attributed to either cloning mutation or genome sequencing error but is not part of any functional motif. The activity of the recombinant protein was assayed using four potential allylic substrates, DMAPP, GPP, FPP, and GGPP. As indicated in Table 1 and Fig. 1, the enzyme catalyzed the conversion of all but GGPP. Among the productive substrates, the highest kcat value of 0.8 s−1 was obtained for FPP, with kcat = ∼0.5 s−1 for DMAPP and GPP (Table 1). These rate constants are comparable with the values of 0.42 and 0.204 s−1 obtained, respectively, for HsFPPS (3Kavanagh K.L. Guo K. Dunford J.E. Wu X. Knapp S. Ebetino F.H. Rogers M.J. Russell R.G.

All three productive substrates had Km values in the low micromolar range (from 1.9 to 7.3 μm), as did IPP (8.4 μm), as found also for human (8Kavanagh K.L. Dunford J.E. Bunkoczi G. Russell R.G.

Judging kcat/Km ratios in Table 1, the efficiency of the Plasmodium enzyme is lowest with FPP as the substrate (however, the differences vis-à-vis DMAPP and IPP are not significant) and roughly in the same range as that of human GGPPS (8Kavanagh K.L.

Most significantly, TLC analysis (Fig. 1) revealed GGPP to be the final product for each of the three allylic substrates. Based on this, we propose that, at least under the conditions tested, the Plasmodium enzyme is a GGPPS (traces of intermediate products were present due to premature stoppage of the reaction as also in product analysis of human FPPS and GGPPS assays) (3Kavanagh K.L.

Here, we identified a specific RXRα antagonist, danthron, from the traditional Chinese medicine rhubarb. Danthron repressed all tested RXRα-involved response element transcription, including the RXRE, PPRE, FXRE, and LXRE. Results from native PAGE and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based assays indicated that danthron bound to the tetrameric RXRα-LBD in a specific stoichimetric ratio, and such a binding could influence the corepressor SMRT affinity to the receptor. Additionally, a unique tetrameric structure of the apo-RXRα ligand-binding domain (LBD) was determined, which exhibited a larger tetramer interface and different ligand-binding pocket size compared with the one previously reported. Together with the biochemical and biophysical results, the determined crystal structure of danthron-soaked RXRα-LBD suggested a new mechanism for danthron antagonism to tetrameric RXRα. Moreover, the in vivo efficient improvement of insulin sensitivity by danthron was observed in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice.

Chambon P. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Lazar M.A. Leid M. De Lera A.R. Lotan R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Gronemeyer H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 760-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). RXR also self-associates into homodimer or homotetramer in the active or auto-repressed state (2Kersten S. Dong D. Lee W. Reczek P.R. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is involved in a broad spectrum of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, metabolism, morphogenesis, and embryogenic development (3Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A. Kakizuka A. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 99-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Giguère V. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, RXR has been considered as an important target for drug discovery in the treatment of cancer and metabolic syndromes (5Tanaka T. De Luca L.M.

In structure, RXR exhibits typical features of nuclear receptor family. It primarily consists of a central DNA-binding domain and a carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) (7de Lera A.R. Bourguet W. Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The multifunctional LBD is responsible for RXR dimerization, tetramerization, and ligand-induced activation (8Gronemeyer H. Gustafsson J.A. Laudet V. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 950-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). It is suggested that RXR exists predominately in inactive homotetramer in the absence of ligand in vivo and dissociates upon ligand binding to form homodimer or heterodimers with other NRs (9Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To date, crystal structures of apoRXRα-LBD have been determined both in dimeric and tetrameric conformations (10Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 11Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The tetramer is formed with two dimers packed in a bottom-to-bottom manner (11Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Binding of agonist such as RXR natural ligand 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA) induces notable conformational changes in which the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain rotates and moves to its active position to seal off the ligand-binding pocket (LBP), thus recruiting coactivators to initiate transcription (12Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Moras D. Mol.

Gronemeyer H. de Lera A.R. Bourguet W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17323-17328Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, ligand-induced dissociation of the tetramer is considered to be the first step for RXR activation, and tetramer formation serves to sequester excess RXR into an inactive pool within the cell (15Kersten S. Pan L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14263-14269Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the structural basis regarding RXR antagonist still remains elusive. Small molecules that selectively regulate RXR signaling pathways are useful for their therapeutic application (7de Lera A.R. Bourguet W. Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). RXR agonists have been reported to exhibit glucose-lowering, insulin-sensitizing, and anti-obesity efficiency in animal models of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (16Altucci L. Leibowitz M.D. Ogilvie K.M. de Lera A.R. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 793-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, undesirable side effects such as hypertriglyceridemia and suppression of the thyroid hormone axis also exist (6Pinaire J.A. Reifel-Miller A. PPAR Res. 2007; 2007: 94156Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Currently, there have been increasing numbers of reports on RXR antagonists, which are found to decrease body weight, plasma glucose, and insulin levels, while exhibiting few effects on food intake in vivo (17Sakaki J. Kishida M. Konishi K. Gunji H. Toyao A. Matsumoto Y. Kanazawa T. Uchiyama H. Fukaya H. Mitani H. Arai Y. Kimura M. Bioorg Med. Chem.

In the current work, we identified a novel RXRα antagonist danthron, 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone (see Fig. 1A), from the traditional Chinese medicine rhubarb. This natural product repressed all of the tested RXRα-involved response elements transcription, including RXRE, PPRE, FXRE, and LXRE, without binding to the corresponding nuclear receptors, except RXRα. Results from the native PAGE indicated that danthron bound to the tetrameric RXRα-LBD and transformed the 9cRA-induced RXRα-LBD dimer to tetramer. ITC-based assay revealed that danthron bound to RXRα-LBD with a stoichimetric ratio of 1:2 (two ligands bound to one RXRα-LBD tetramer). Furthermore, danthron binding could influnce the affinity of the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptor (SMRT) to the receptor. In addition, a unique homotetrameric structure of apoRXRα-LBD was discovered, which exhibited a larger tetramer interface and different ligand-binding pocket size, compared with the previously reported one. The danthron-interacting residues in LBP were determined by the crystal structure of danthron-soaked RXRα-LBD. These results have thus suggested a potential mechanism of RXRα-LBD tetramer stabilization by danthron. Furthermore, danthron exhibited an efficient improvement of insulin sensitivity in DIO mice, implying that danthron functioned as an insulin sensitizer in vivo. As a first report on RXRα-antagonist structural characterization, our work was expected to have provided a new insight of a novel antagonistic mode on the inactive RXR tetramer. All the cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. The UAS-TK-Luc reporter was generously donated by Dr. Daniel P. Kelly (Washington University School of Medicine). The fusion constructs of pGAL4-RXRα-LBD, pGAL4-LXRα-LBD, pGAL4-FXR-LBD, and pGAL4-PPARγ-LBD were generated using pGBKT7-RXRα-LBD, pcDNA3.1-LXRα, pET22b-FXR-LBD, and pcDNA3.1-PPARγ (kindly provided by Dr. Gordon Hager, National Cancer Institute) as templates, respectively. The pGL3-pro-RXRE-Luc vector was constructed by inserting four DR1 sequences with XhoI-BglII sites. The pGL3-pro-LXRE-Luc plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Peter A. Edwards (The Medicine Institute at University of California, Los Angeles), and pGL3-pro-FXRE-Luc vector was kindly provided by Dr. Majlis Hermansson (AstraZeneca, Mölndal, Sweden). The corepressor SMRT peptide was synthesized with the sequence NMGLEAIIRKALMGKY based on the published results (19Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D.

Mammalian one-hybrid test and transactivation experiment of RXRα-involved response element were performed using luciferase assay. HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Transient transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 h after transfected with luciferase reporter vector and Renilla luciferase vector pRL-SV40 (50 ng/well), cells were incubated with varied concentrations of compounds for another 24 h. Luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega). Preparation of RXRα-LBD was performed according to the previously published approach (14Nahoum V. Pérez E. Germain P. Rodríguez-Barrios F. Manzo F. Kammerer S. Lemaire G. Hirsch O. Royer C.A. Gronemeyer H. de Lera A.R. Bourguet W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17323-17328Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, the coding sequence of human RXRα-LBD (residues 221–458) was cloned to the vector pET15b, and Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was used for protein expression. The culture was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated at 25 °C for 6 h. His-tagged RXRα-LBD was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), and the tag was then removed by thrombin (Novagen). The protein was further purified with Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Binding affinity of danthron toward RXRα-LBD was assayed with a BIACORE 3000 instrument (BIACORE) based on our previous report (20Zhang L. Liu W. Hu T. Du L. Luo C. Chen K. Shen X. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5370-5379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All agents were purchased from GE Healthcare. Briefly, RXRα-LBD was immobilized onto a CM5 sensor chip according to the standard primary amine-coupling procedures. Danthron was serially diluted and injected into the channels at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 60 s, followed by disassociation for 120 s. BIAevaluation software (version 3.1; Biacore) was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of the compound. The separating gel was prepared by mixing 4.8 ml of water, 2.7 ml of 30% acrylamide/0.8% bisacrylamide, 2.5 ml 5 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 0.05 ml of 10% (w/v) ammonium persulfate, and 0.005 ml of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine. The stacking gel was prepared by mixing 3.3 ml of water, 0.67 ml of 30% acrylamide/0.8% bisacrylamide, 1 ml 0.5 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.03 ml of 10% (w/v) ammonium persulfate, and 0.005 ml of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine. Phosphate gel buffer was prepared with 100 mm sodium phosphate and adjusted to pH 6.5. Albumin from bovine serum (66 kDa for monomer and 132 kDa for dimer) was purchased from Sigma and used as a native PAGE marker. A constant current of 30 mA was used for the 5-h polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All experiments were performed at 4 °C. The thermodynamic properties of danthron binding to RXRα-LBD, corepressor SMRT peptide binding to apo-, or danthron-bound RXRα-LBD were determined using a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (MicroCal) in phosphate buffer at 25 °C. The heat of dilution was obtained by injecting danthron or SMRT into the same buffer and subtracted from the reaction before the fitting process. RXRα-LBD crystals grew in the condition of 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.5, 10% PEG4000, 5% glycerol. The complex crystal was obtained by soaking the RXRα-LBD crystal in the danthron-containing mother liquor with a mass ratio of 1:50. Diffraction data were collected at BL17U of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility in China and integrated with HKL2000 (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab C57/BL6 male mice were obtained from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. Mice were fed with a high fat diet for 3 months and treated with danthron (5 mg/kg) or vehicle orally for 8 weeks. The animals were then fasted for 6 h and then given intraperitoneal injection of insulin at 1.5 units/kg. Blood samples were analyzed at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min using Accu-Chek active blood sugar test meter (Roche Diagnostics). All of the animals received humane care, and the procedures in these experiments were performed according to the institutional ethical guidelines. According to the SPR technology-based assay, danthron dose-dependently bound to RXRα-LBD with a KD value of 6.2 μm (Fig. 1B). To further explore the effect of danthron on the transactivation of RXRα, a mammalian one-hybrid test was employed. As shown in Fig. 1C, danthron inhibited 9cRA-induced RXRα transactivation by IC50 at 0.11 μm. Moreover, danthron repressed the transactivation of RXRE mediated by the RXRα:RXRα homodimer (Fig. 1D). Also, we examined the selectivity of danthron to several kinds of RXRα-involved heterodimers. The results showed that danthron dose-dependently repressed the transactivation of the relevant RXRα-involved response elements, including PPRE, FXRE, and LXRE, which are mediated by RXRα:PPARγ, RXRα:FXR, and RXRα:LXRα heterodimers, respectively (Fig. 1, E–G). However, danthron exhibited no activities to these nuclear receptors in mammalian one-hybrid test (Fig. 1, H–J). These results thus suggested that danthron exerted its transrepression activities on the RXRα homodimer and RXRα-involved heterodimers just through targeting RXRα, further addressing its selectivity to RXRα over other nuclear receptors. Currently, a few complex structures of antagonist-bound NRs have been reported, including the estrogen receptor (27Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Ohman L.

Nature. 2002; 415: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), glucocorticoid receptor (28Schoch G.A. D'Arcy B. Stihle M. Burger D. Bär D. Benz J. Thoma R. Ruf A. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 395: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and retinoic acid receptor (29Bourguet W. Vivat V. Wurtz J.M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). All of these structures revealed a conserved dimeric fold, in which antagonists induced H12 adopting an alternative position to recruit corepressor. Here, we wondered whether danthron could induce dissociation of tetrameric RXRα-LBD to dimer. The results from size exclusion chromatogram and native PAGE assays suggested that purified RXRα-LBD existed in equilibrium of tetramer and dimer (Fig. 2, A and B). As an agonist, 9cRA changed this equilibrium to dimer (Fig. 2B), in accord with the crystal structure of 9cRA-induced dimeric RXRα-LBD (12Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, danthron was found to induce this equilibrium preferring to tetramer as indicated by the fact that the danthron-bound RXRα-LBD was mostly in tetrameric form (Fig. 2B). Moreover, danthron inhibited the 9cRA-induced RXRα-LBD dimer formation to tetramerization in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). These results thus suggested that danthron binding could stabilize RXRα-LBD tetramer. Different from other nuclear receptor antagonists that bound to dimeric NRs, danthron played its role on tetrameric RXRα. To further clarify the stoichimetric ratio of danthron binding to RXRα-LBD, ITC experiment was performed. The KD value of danthron bound to RXRα-LBD by ITC experiment was determined at 7.5 μm (Fig. 2D), in a good agreement with the SPR result. However, danthron was found to bind to the receptor in a ratio of 1:2 (Fig. 2D), different from the previously published reports on the equal ratio of receptor-ligand binding (12Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Moras D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Nahoum V. Pérez E. Germain P. Rodríguez-Barrios F. Manzo F. Kammerer S. Lemaire G. Hirsch O. Royer C.A. Gronemeyer H. de Lera A.R. Bourguet W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17323-17328Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It was postulated that binding of the corepressor like the SMRT to nuclear receptors could be stabilized by antagonists (30Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 31Jackson T.A. Richer J.K. Bain D.L. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Here, we evaluated the potential effects of danthron binding on SMRT peptide affinity to RXRα-LBD by ITC-based assay. As indicated in Fig. 2, E and F, SMRT peptide bound to unliganded RXRα-LBD in a ratio of 1:1, whereas danthron binding changed this ratio to 1:2. Therefore, the biochemical and biophysical results from the native PAGE and ITC experiments showed that danthron bound to the tetrameric RXRα-LBD in a specific stoichimetric ratio, and danthron binding could stabilize this tetramer and influenced the corepressor SMRT affinity to RXRα-LBD. To further elucidate the structural basis of danthron as a specific RXRα antagonist, we tried co-crystallization of RXRα-LBD with danthron but failed to get the crystals either in the presence or absence of corepressor SMRT peptide. Unexpectedly, we determined a unique homotetramer structure of apo-RXRα-LBD. As shown in Fig. 3A, the analyzed crystal structure of apo-RXRα-LBD generally adopted a similar homotetrameric packing with two symmetric dimers combined in a bottom-to-bottom fashion compared with the previously reported one (11Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, superposition of these two tetrameric structures gave different packing modes (Fig. 3B). The two upper dimers overlapped well, whereas the lower dimer in our structure rotated along the tetramer axis (Fig. 3B). Further alignment among the symmetric dimers in these two tetramers and the previously reported RXRα-LBD dimer (10Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 11Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) showed a conserved core structure and variable C-terminal helices H11 and H12 (Fig. 3C). Moreover, unlike the dimeric RXRα-LBD with two identical chains, chains A and B in these two tetramers exhibited different conformations (Fig. 3D). It seemed that C-terminal swinging conformations existed in the apo-RXRα-LBD. As shown in Fig. 3D, in chain B of our structure, H11 moved apart from the core LBD and was shortened by half a turn, whereas H12 moved 9.5Å horizontally and rotated 60° counterclockwise. Chain A also behaved similar movement and rotation, but to a lesser extent. Although H11 and H12 in different structures seemed to be in a swinging manner, their conformations were actually not flexible, considering that H12 positioned itself into the groove between H3′ and H4′ from its neighbor dimer (Fig. 3A). The changes in C-terminal conformation for the apo-RXRα-LBD resulted in different sizes of LBP (Fig. 3E). The previously reported tetrameric RXRα-LBD had a slightly larger pocket on one side and a smaller one on the other compared with the dimeric RXRα-LBD (10Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 11Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, chain B in our structure had an even larger pocket size, and chain A had the smallest size. It seemed that as the LBP in one side was enlarged, the pocket in the other may adjust itself by shrinking. In addition, there were significant conformational changes on the tetramer interface, comparing our apo-RXRα-LBD structure with the reported structure (11Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the published structure, the H3/H3 interface was composed of the residues 264–269 of chain B and the residues 269–273 of chain A, the H11/H11 interface was constituted of Leu436 and Phe439 from each chain, and the AF-2/coactivator binding site interface was made up of Leu451, Met45, and Leu455 with helices 3 and 4 (11Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our results revealed that Leu436 and Phe439 in chain A and Phe438 in chain B constituted the H11/H11 interface (Fig. 3F). H11 of chain A also made additional hydrophobic interactions with Arg302 in H4 and Trp305 in H5 of chain B. The AF-2 residues 451LMEML455 in chain A resembled the LXXLL motif of coactivators (underlined residues indicate a conserved sequence (11Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)) and interacted with Phe277, Lys284, and Val298 in chain B (Fig. 3G). These conformational changes in our structure made the two symmetric dimers adhere to each other burying 1475.8Å2 of their surface, much larger than the previously reported tetramer (1242.8Å2) (11Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These results thus indicated that our determined apo-RXRα-LBD might be in a more stable state. Although we failed to get the co-crystal of RXRα-LBD with danthron, the determined danthron-soaked crystal structure of tetrameric RXRα-LBD seemed to be valuable for elucidation of the ligand interacting information in the LBP. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the clear electron density was indicative of danthron existence. In addition, the binding stoichimetric ratio observed in the structure was in good accordance with the ITC results, where two ligands bound to one tetrameric RXRα-LBD. Danthron was found to bind to the hydrophobic LBP by interacting with Phe313 in H5, Ile324 and Leu326 in S1, Val332 in S2, Val342 and Phe346 in H7, and Phe437 in H11 (Fig. 4A). Danthron binding was further stabilized by forming hydrogen bonds with Lys440 (Fig. 4C). Interaction with danthron made Lys440 closer to the compound and induced an overturning of Phe439 in H11. Mutation of the conserved residue Phe439 on the tetramer interface was reported to abolish the ability of RXR to form tetramer (32Kersten S. Reczek P.R. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29759-29768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Upon danthron binding to RXRα-LBD, Phe439 might play an essential role in stabilizing this homotetramer. The residues involved in the hydrophobic interaction also adjusted themselves after danthron binding. As shown in Fig. 4C, the most significant conformational changes occurred on the β-sheets S1 and S2. To approach danthron, Leu326 in S1 and Val332 in S2 moved toward the ligand. This movement made the neighbor residues His331 and His333 alter their conformations to get the whole β-sheet closer to danthron. Phe313 and Arg316 in H5 also shifted greatly. Arg316 was the essential residue in the active RXRα-LBD structure by forming hydrogen bonds with RXR agonist 9cRA (12Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these conformational changes of the hydrophobic residues led to the changes on the LBP electrostatic surface (Fig. 4D). Because danthron was an anthraquinone type of compound with strong hydrophobic features in structure, changes on the LBP electrostatic surface were expected to facilitate danthron binding to the pocket. Moreover, the N-terminal part of H3 failed to bend toward the ligand as it did in the agonist-induced activation state, due to the steric hindrance from danthron (Fig. 4E). Although the LBP on both sides were open to solvent, danthron was found to bind to merely two chains of the tetramer as indicated in our determined crystal structure of danthron-soaked RXRα-LBD. The pocket of chain A was shrunken and not large enough for danthron binding. The binding stoichimetric ratio in the structure is in good accord with the ITC results (Fig. 2D). The insulin tolerance test result showed that danthron-treated diet-induced obesity mice exhibited lower glucose levels after insulin challenge, compared with the control vehicle-treated group (Fig. 5). Our results thereby suggested that danthron functioned as an insulin sensitizer in vivo. Structural comparison of our determined apo-RXRα-LBD structure with the previously reported tetramer (11Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) clearly showed that the conformational changes of C-terminal H12 in our structure were more substantial, which resulted in a larger tetramer interface and different LBP size (Fig. 3). It is tentatively suggested that our unique crystal packing might possibly attribute to the different crystallization conditions. As indicated, our crystals grew in a lower pH value of 6.5, different from that of 7.5 for the previous tetramer (11Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dimeric RXRα-LBD crystal grew in a neutral pH of 7.0 (10Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of these different conformations might be related to the competence of RXR for different ligands. RXR is known to distribute widely in various tissues with variable intracellular pHs (16Altucci L. Leibowitz M.D. Ogilvie K.M. de Lera A.R. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 793-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Therefore, RXR might probably adopt different conformations to accept different ligands, consequently forming heterodimers with different nuclear receptors to mediate different genes transcription, which was in accordance to the central position of RXR in the signaling pathways (1Germain P. Chambon P. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Lazar M.A. Leid M. De Lera A.R. Lotan R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Gronemeyer H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 760-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). RXR was previously expected to exhibit similar antagonistic features to other nuclear receptors (7de Lera A.R. Bourguet W. Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, in our work, the specific RXR antagonist danthron employs an alternative antagonistic mechanism on RXRα. By interacting with the residues on the essential helices H5 and H11, and β-sheets S1 and S2, danthron stabilizes RXRα-LBD in its inactive tetramer state, where the essential residue Phe439 on the tetramer interface might play an important part. Mutation of this conserved residue Phe439 on the tetramer interface was reported to abolish the ability of RXR to form tetramer (32Kersten S. Reczek P.R. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29759-29768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RXR exists predominately in inactive homotetramer in vivo, which is different from the other NRs (9Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); thus, it was not surprising to find an antagonist acting on this inactive tetramer. Because the agonist-induced dissociation of the tetramer is considered to be the first step of RXR activation, danthron plays its role at the initial stage. Danthron arrests RXRα from rearrangement for transactivation, and the autorepression by homotetramer maintains RXRα in its inactive state. Therefore, the antagonism on the tetrameric RXR makes danthron distinguished from other antagonists on dimeric NRs. In addition, our results from ITC-based assay for the first time indicated that the corepressor SMRT peptide had a binding affinity to the unliganded RXRα-LBD in vitro, although the mechanism involved in RXR repression by this corepressor is still not revealed. Moreover, binding of danthron was found to affect the corepressor SMRT affinity to the receptor. Cell-based assays showed that danthron could inhibit RXR capability to transactivate reporter constructs driven by response elements for RXRα homodimer and all of the tested RXRα-containing heterodimers. Also, reversion of 9cRA-induced RXRα-LBD dimerization to tetramerization by danthron was observed in native PAGE (Fig. 2C). These results suggested that danthron-bound RXRα-LBD, as an inactive tetramer for transactivation, had no activity on the RXR-regulated gene transcriptions. Therefore, by stabilizing the tetrameric RXRα-LBD, danthron takes its effects on repressing all of the RXRα-involved transcriptions. Danthron is an anthraquinone-type of compound isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine rhubarb. Rhubarb extracts have been proved to process promising antidiabetic and anticancer properties, although their detailed mechanisms remain unclear (33Huang Q. Lu G. Shen H.M. Chung M.C. Ong C.N. Med. Res. Rev. 2007; 27: 609-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). One of the rhubarb extracts is rhein, which has an additional carboxyl group at the C3 site of danthron. Rhein was proved effective in the treatment of experimental diabetic nephropathy (34Gao Q. Qin W.S. Jia Z.H. Zheng J.M. Zeng C.H. Li L.S. Liu Z.H. Planta Med. 2010; 76: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Emodin, another main component of rhubarb, is an analog of danthron with the C3 and C6 sites substituted for methyl and hydroxyl groups, respectively. It was reported to have the competency to activate PPARγ (35Liu Y. Jia L. Liu Z.C. Zhang H. Zhang P.J. Wan Q. Wang R. Exp. Mol. Med. 2009; 41: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and emodin-treated diabetic mice showed improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (36Xue J. Ding W. Liu Y. Fitoterapia. 2010; 81: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Possessing a similar chemical structure to other components from rhubarb, danthron was thereby expected to display similar biological activities. Our insulin tolerance test experiment in DIO mice treated with danthron has revealed that this natural product functioned as an efficient insulin sensitizer in vivo. Our results are expected to have provided new insights into the structural basis of RXR antagonists for their potential therapeutic application. The ability to improve insulin sensitivity has made danthron a promising lead compound for the development of antidiabetic drugs and supplied useful information for understanding the pharmacological mechanisms of rhubarb.

https://openalex.org/W1969213466,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of renal cancer. One of the processes disturbed in this cancer type is alternative splicing, although phenomena underlying these disturbances remain unknown. Alternative splicing consists of selective removal of introns and joining of residual exons of the primary transcript, to produce mRNA molecules of different sequence. Splicing aberrations may lead to tumoral transformation due to synthesis of impaired splice variants with oncogenic potential. In this paper we hypothesized that disturbed alternative splicing in ccRCC may result from improper expression of splicing factors, mediators of splicing reactions.Using real-time PCR and Western-blot analysis we analyzed expression of seven splicing factors belonging to SR proteins family (SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp20, SRp75, SRp40, SRp55 and 9G8), and one non-SR factor, hnRNP A1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1) in 38 pairs of tumor-control ccRCC samples. Moreover, we analyzed splicing patterns of five genes involved in carcinogenesis and partially regulated by analyzed splicing factors: RON, CEACAM1, Rac1, Caspase-9, and GLI1.We found that the mRNA expression of splicing factors was disturbed in tumors when compared to paired controls, similarly as levels of SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 proteins. The correlation coefficients between expression levels of specific splicing factors were increased in tumor samples. Moreover, alternative splicing of five analyzed genes was also disturbed in ccRCC samples and splicing pattern of two of them, Caspase-9 and CEACAM1 correlated with expression of SF2/ASF in tumors. We conclude that disturbed expression of splicing factors in ccRCC may possibly lead to impaired alternative splicing of genes regulating tumor growth and this way contribute to the process of carcinogenesis."

In conclusion, by inhibiting osteoblast function and inducing bone resorption, HES1 is an intracellular determinant of bone mass and structure."
https://openalex.org/W2062480336,"NKT cells contribute to the modulation of immune responses and are believed to be important in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and infectious diseases, as well as cancer. Variations in the composite NKT cytokine response may determine individual disease susceptibility or severity. Due to low frequencies in peripheral blood, knowledge of the breadth of ex vivo human NKT cell functions has been limited. To bridge this gap, we studied highly purified NKT cells from PBMC of healthy donors and assessed the production of 27 effector functions using sensitive Elispot and multiplex bead assays. We found the ex vivo human NKT cell response is predominantly comprised of the chemokines MIP1-α, and MIP1-β as well as the Th1 cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α. Although lower in magnitude, there was also significant production of IL-2, IL-4, and perforin after mitogen stimulation. Surprisingly, little/no IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, or IL-13 was detected, and no subjects' NKT cells produced IL-17. Comparison of the NKT functional profiles between age-matched male and female subjects revealed similar IL-4 responses, but higher frequencies of cells producing IFN-γ and MIP1-α, from males. There were no gender differences in the circulating NKT subset distribution. These findings implicate chemokines as a major mechanism by which NKT cells control responses in humans. In addition, the panoply of Th2 and Th17 cytokine secretion by NKT cells from healthy donors may not be as pronounced as previously believed. NKT cells may therefore contribute to the gender bias found in many diseases."

As such, (de)regulated Taspase1 function is expected not only to be vital for ordered development but may also be relevant for disease. However, the full repertoires of Taspase1 targets as well as the exact biochemical requirements for its efficient and substrate-specific cleavage are not yet resolved. Also, no cellular assays for this protease are currently available, hampering the exploitation of the (patho)biological relevance of Taspase1. Here, we developed highly efficient cell-based translocation biosensor assays to probe Taspase1 trans-cleavage in vivo. These modular sensors harbor variations of Taspase1 cleavage sites and localize to the cytoplasm. Expression of Taspase1 but not of inactive Taspase1 mutants or of unrelated proteases triggers proteolytic cleavage and nuclear accumulation of the biosensors. Employing our assay combined with scanning mutagenesis, we identified the sequence and spatial requirements for efficient Taspase1 processing in liquid and solid tumor cell lines. Collectively, our results defined an improved Taspase1 consensus recognition sequence, Q3(F/I/L/V)2D1↓G1′X2′D3′D4′, allowing the first genome-wide bioinformatic identification of the human Taspase1 degradome. Among the 27 most likely Taspase1 targets are cytoplasmic but also nuclear proteins, such as the upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2) or the nuclear RNA export factors 2/5 (NXF2/5). Cleavage site recognition and proteolytic processing of selected targets were verified in the context of the biosensor and for the full-length proteins. We provide novel mechanistic insights into the function and bona fide targets of Taspase1 allowing for a focused investigation of the (patho)biological relevance of this type 2 asparaginase.

By cleaving proteins, proteases are involved in the control of a large number of key physiological processes such as development, metabolism, tissue remodeling, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (1Overall C.M. Dean R.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006; 25: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 2Knauer S.K. Moodt S. Berg T. Liebel U. Pepperkok R. Stauber R.H.

Protease signaling therefore differs from the majority of other signaling pathways by being mostly irreversible (3Turk B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Protease signaling is strictly regulated, and the deregulation of protease activity can contribute to various pathologies, including cancer (3Turk B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). The human Taspase1 gene encodes a protein of 420 amino acids (aa), 4The abbreviations used are: aaamino acidαantiDoxdoxycyclineMLLmixed lineage leukemiaNESnuclear export signalNLSnuclear import signal. which is the proenzyme of Taspase1. It belongs to a family of enzymes possessing an asparaginase-2 homology domain. In the MEROPS database, Taspase1 is found as T02.004, classifying this protein as a class PB, subclass PB(T), and T2 family protease. In contrast to the other cis-active type 2 asparaginases, such as amidohydrolases, l-asparaginase, and glycosylasparaginase, only Taspase1 is able to cleave other substrates in trans (4Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2003; 115: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, Taspase1 represents a distinct class of proteolytic enzymes. Taspase1-mediated cleavage of proteins follows distinct aspartate residues, suggesting that Taspase1 evolved from hydrolyzing asparagines and glycosylasparagines to recognize a conserved peptide motif with an aspartate at the P1 position (4Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2003; 115: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, the discovery of Taspase1 founded a new class of endopeptidases that utilize the N-terminal threonine of its mature β-subunit as the active site (4Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2003; 115: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The N-terminal threonine (Thr234) is generated by autoproteolysis of the Taspase1 proenzyme (referred to as cis-cleavage) into the two subunits α and β, which assemble into an asymmetric α2/β2-heterotetramer, representing the active protease (5Khan J.A. Dunn B.M. Tong L. Structure. 2005; 13: 1443-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutation of the catalytic nucleophile, Thr234, significantly attenuates the catalytic activity of Taspase1 (4Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Korsmeyer S.J.

Recent data indicate also that other essential proteins, such as the precursor of the transcription factor IIA (TF2A) (13Zhou H. Spicuglia S. Hsieh J.J. Mitsiou D.J. Høiby T. Veenstra G.J.

However, the molecular mechanisms of how Taspase1 affects TF2A or MLL protein function through site-specific proteolysis and what other (patho)physiological pathways are regulated in humans by Taspase1 remain to be determined. Besides genetic instruments, chemical decoys allowing the targeted inhibition/activation of proteins are powerful tools to dissect complex biological pathways in general. Unfortunately, catalytic activity of Taspase1 is not affected by common protease inhibitors, and no small molecule inhibitors of this enzyme are currently available (4Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H.

Consequently, we developed and employed here cell-based assays combined with bioinformatic approaches to provide novel insights into Taspase1 (patho)biological functions. The Ab used are as follows: α-GFP (sc-8334; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany); α-Myc tag and α-ClevCasp3 (New England Biolabs); α-Taspase1 (AP1330b, directed against the C terminus; BioCat GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany); α-GAPDH (sc-47724), α-TF2A-β (sc-5315), and α-Casp3 (sc-7272) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Appropriate HRP-, Cy3-, or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and α-USF2 (sc-81645) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and α-NXF5 (sc-133860) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Reagents were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Cell lines used in the study (supplemental Table S2) were maintained and transfected as described previously (12Gaussmann A. Wenger T. Eberle I.

Twelve-bit black and white images were captured using a digital Axiocam CCD camera (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Quantitation, image analysis, and presentation were performed as described previously (2Knauer S.K. Moodt S. Berg T. Liebel U. Pepperkok R. Stauber R.H.

Nuclei were marked by Hoechst 33258 staining as described previously (2Knauer S.K. Moodt S. Berg T. Liebel U. Pepperkok R. Stauber R.H.

To determine the average intracellular protein localization, at least 200 fluorescent cells from three separate images were examined in three independent experiments. The number of cells exhibiting cytoplasmic (cytoplasmic signal >75% of the total cellular signal), cytoplasmic and nuclear, or nuclear (nuclear signal >75% of the total cellular signal) fluorescence was counted. To generate plasmid p_NLS-GFP/GST-CS2-NESRev (p_BioTasp), encoding a fusion composed of the SV40 large T-antigen NLS, GST, and GFP, the Taspase1 cleavage site from MLL (CS2; aa 2713KISQLDGVDD2722), and a Myc epitope-tagged NES from the HIV-1 Rev protein (NESRev) (20Heger P. Lohmaier J. Schneider G. Schweimer K. Stauber R.H. Traffic. 2001; 2: 544-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the CS2 coding sequence was inserted into vector pNLS-GFP/GST-CS3-RevNES (p_BioCasp3), replacing CS3. p_BioCasp3 encodes a biosensor harboring the cleavage site for caspase3 (CS3: aa KRKGDEVDGVDE) (2Knauer S.K.

Moodt S. Berg T. Liebel U. Pepperkok R. Stauber R.H. Traffic. 2005; 6: 594-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for BioTasp variants, in which CS2 was mutated (p_BioTaspmut; see supplemental Table S2 and supplemental Table S1 for oligonucleotides used), were generated by oligonucleotide-annealing and cloning into the NotI/XhoI restriction sites of p_BioTasp as described previously (2Knauer S.K. Moodt S. Berg T. Liebel U. Pepperkok R. Stauber R.H. Traffic. 2005; 6: 594-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Likewise, the coding sequences for full-length TF2A (p_BioTaspTF), its cleavage site (p_BioTaspTFCS), full-length USF2 (p_BioTaspUSF2), or the cleavage site from myosin1F (aa 152–268) (p_BioTaspMyo) or NXF5 (aa 626–692) (p_BioTaspNXF5) were inserted into p_BioTasp, thereby replacing the CS2. pTRE-NLS-GFP/GST-CS2-NESRev (p_BioTaspi) allows the inducible expression of the biosensor (“Tet-Off”) and was constructed by inserting the NLS-GFP/GST-CS2-NESRev coding sequence into pTRE-NLS-GFP/GST-NESRev (2Knauer S.K. Moodt S. Berg T. Liebel U. Pepperkok R. Stauber R.H. Traffic. 2005; 6: 594-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

Cloning of the Taspase1 coding sequence into expression vectors pc3, pc3-GFP, pc3-BFP, and pc3-mCherry using BamHI/EcoRI or BamHI/NheI restriction sites, respectively, allowed the expression of Taspase1, alone or as a fusion with fluorescent proteins as described previously (17Knauer S.K.

Transfectants were selected by G418 (800 μg/ml) and puromycin (2 μg/ml) selection, as well as by fluorescence-activated cell sorting as reported previously (15Fetz V. Knauer S.K. Bier C. Kriess J.P.

For the in silico identification of potential human Taspase1 targets, ScanProsite searches were performed using the patterns Q(FILV)DGXDD, Q(FILV)DGXXD, and Q(FILV)DGXDX as queries. Searches were performed in the human taxon of the UniProtKB/SwissProt database, and all other parameters were used at default settings. Pathway analysis was performed using GeneSpringGX11.0.2 (Waldbronn, Germany) and MAPPFinder, a component of the software package GenMAPP version 2.1 (31Dahlquist K.D. Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2004; 7.5: 1-26Google Scholar). For experiments stating p values, a paired Student's t test was performed. Unless stated otherwise, p values represent data obtained from three independent experiments done in triplicate. p values <0.05 were considered as significant. Previous studies employed mainly in vitro assays to analyze Taspase1 function. As biochemical data must be verified at the cellular level, we here focused on the most relevant test tube, the living cell. To develop such a cell-based assay, we first cloned Taspase1 from a human head and neck tumor. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame (ORF) identical to the one described by Hsieh et al. (4Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2003; 115: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The same ORF could be amplified from the BCR-Abl+ chronic myeloic leukemia cell line K562. Upon ectopic expression as a Taspase1-GFP, -BFP, or -mCherry fusion, the protease localized predominantly to the nucleus, accumulating at the nucleoli in living cells (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Localization was confirmed by staining with α-Taspase1 Ab (Fig. 1a). A similar localization, although with less prominent nucleolar accumulation, was observed for a Taspase1 mutant, in which the catalytic nucleophile, Thr234, was changed into Val or Ala (TaspTV, TaspTA) (Figs. 1d, 2, and 4 and supplemental Fig. S1a, and data not shown). These mutations abolished the enzymatic activity of Taspase1 (4Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Korsmeyer S.J.

BioTasp is composed of GST, GFP, combinations of a nuclear import (NLS), and a Myc epitope-tagged export (NES) signal, combined with the Taspase1 cleavage site from MLL (CS2; aa 2713KISQLDGVDD2722). BioTasp localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm but is continuously shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Coexpression of Taspase1-BFP (Tasp-BFP) results in the removal of the NES by proteolytic cleavage of the biosensor, allowing nuclear accumulation of the green fluorescent fusion.▶, NLS; ◀, NES. c, expression of Taspase1 triggers nuclear accumulation of BioTasp in living HeLa transfectants. The autofluorescent biosensor is predominantly cytoplasmic (upper panel), and coexpression of Taspase1-BFP results in the proteolytic cleavage of the Myc-NESRev and nuclear accumulation of BioTasp (lower panel).

Hence, we generated a Taspase1 protease biosensor by integrating the Taspase1 cleavage site from MLL (CS2; aa 2713KISQLD↓GVDD2722) into a biosensor backbone composed of GST, GFP, the SV40 large T-antigen nuclear import signal (NLS), and a Myc epitope-tagged nuclear export signal from the HIV-1 Rev protein (NESRev) (Fig. 1b). The resulting NLS-GFP/GST-CS2-NESRev fusion protein (BioTasp) localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1c), but it is continuously shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, as confirmed by treatment with the export inhibitor leptomycin B (supplemental Fig. S3). Importantly, cotransfection of either Taspase1-BFP (Tasp-BFP) or red fluorescent Taspase1-mCherry (Tasp-mCherry) fusions resulted in the proteolytic cleavage of NESRev and the subsequent nuclear accumulation of BioTasp in various epithelial and liquid cancer cell lines (Fig. 1, c and f; supplemental Fig. S1b; supplemental Table S2). As a control, a construct containing a nonfunctional Taspase1 cleavage site (BioTaspmut, aa 2713KISQLAAVDD2722) or a cleavage site for caspase3 (BioCasp3) remained cytoplasmic under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 1d). Also, no nuclear accumulation was observed upon coexpression of the inactive TaspTV-BFP fusion, the nucleolar HIV-1 Rev-BFP protein, or the unrelated proteases caspase3 or -9, further confirming the specificity of the assay (supplemental Fig. S1c) (data not shown). Proteolytic processing of the biosensor upon expression of untagged or tagged Taspase1 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1e) (data not shown). In contrast to the high amounts of Taspase1 required for cleavage in vitro (14Lee J.T. Chen D.Y. Yang Z. Ramos A.D. Hsieh J.J. Bogyo M. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W1968387088,"Studies on the role of neutrophils in Leishmania infection were mainly performed with L. (L) major, whereas less information is available for L. (L) amazonensis. Previous results from our laboratory showed a large infiltrate of neutrophils in the site of infection in a mouse strain resistant to L. (L.) amazonensis (C3H/HePas). In contrast, the susceptible strain (BALB/c) displayed a predominance of macrophages harboring a high number of amastigotes and very few neutrophils. These findings led us to investigate the interaction of inflammatory neutrophils with L. (L.) amazonensis-infected macrophages in vitro.Mouse peritoneal macrophages infected with L. (L.) amazonensis were co-cultured with inflammatory neutrophils, and after four days, the infection was quantified microscopically. Data are representative of three experiments with similar results. The main findings were 1) intracellular parasites were efficiently destroyed in the co-cultures; 2) the leishmanicidal effect was similar when cells were obtained from mouse strains resistant (C3H/HePas) or susceptible (BALB/c) to L. (L.) amazonensis; 3) parasite destruction did not require contact between infected macrophages and neutrophils; 4) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), neutrophil elastase and platelet activating factor (PAF) were involved with the leishmanicidal activity, and 5) destruction of the parasites did not depend on generation of oxygen or nitrogen radicals, indicating that parasite clearance did not involve the classical pathway of macrophage activation by TNF-α, as reported for other Leishmania species.The present results provide evidence that neutrophils in concert with macrophages play a previously unrecognized leishmanicidal effect on L. (L.) amazonensis. We believe these findings may help to understand the mechanisms involved in innate immunity in cutaneous infection by this Leishmania species."
https://openalex.org/W2043862725,"Non-coding RNA polymerase II transcripts are processed by the poly(A)-independent termination pathway that requires the Nrd1 complex. The Nrd1 complex includes two RNA-binding proteins, the nuclear polyadenylated RNA-binding (Nab) 3 and the nuclear pre-mRNA down-regulation (Nrd) 1 that bind their specific termination elements. Here we report the solution structure of the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) of Nab3 in complex with a UCUU oligonucleotide, representing the Nab3 termination element. The structure shows that the first three nucleotides of UCUU are accommodated on the β-sheet surface of Nab3 RRM, but reveals a sequence-specific recognition only for the central cytidine and uridine. The specific contacts we identified are important for binding affinity in vitro as well as for yeast viability. Furthermore, we show that both RNA-binding motifs of Nab3 and Nrd1 alone bind their termination elements with a weak affinity. Interestingly, when Nab3 and Nrd1 form a heterodimer, the affinity to RNA is significantly increased due to the cooperative binding. These findings are in accordance with the model of their function in the poly(A) independent termination, in which binding to the combined and/or repetitive termination elements elicits efficient termination."

The precise subcellular localization and regulation of Ca(v)3.2 channels in native cells is unknown. Caveolae containing scaffolding protein caveolin-3 (Cav-3) localize many ion channels, signaling proteins and provide temporal and spatial regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) in different cells. We examined the localization and regulation of the Ca(v)3.2 channels in cardiomyocytes. Immunogold labeling and electron microscopy analysis demonstrated co-localization of the Ca(v)3.2 channel and Cav-3 relative to caveolae in ventricular myocytes. Co-immunoprecipitation from neonatal ventricular myocytes or transiently transfected HEK293 cells demonstrated that Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.2 channels co-immunoprecipitate with Cav-3. GST pulldown analysis confirmed that the N terminus region of Cav-3 closely interacts with Ca(v)3.2 channels. Whole cell patch clamp analysis demonstrated that co-expression of Cav-3 significantly decreased the peak Ca(v)3.2 current density in HEK293 cells, whereas co-expression of Cav-3 did not alter peak Ca(v)3.1 current density. In neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes, overexpression of Cav-3 inhibited the peak T-type calcium current (I(Ca,T)) and adenovirus (AdCa(v)3.2)-mediated increase in peak Ca(v)3.2 current, but did not affect the L-type current. The protein kinase A-dependent stimulation of I(Ca,T) by 8-Br-cAMP (membrane permeable cAMP analog) was abolished by siRNA directed against Cav-3. Our findings on functional modulation of the Ca(v)3.2 channels by Cav-3 is important for understanding the compartmentalized regulation of Ca(2+) signaling during normal and pathological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2021748101,"There is increasing interest in multi-allele vaccines to overcome strain-specificity against polymorphic vaccine targets such as Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1). These have been shown to induce broad inhibitory antibodies in vitro and formed the basis for the design of three Diversity-Covering (DiCo) proteins with similar immunological effects. The antibodies produced are to epitopes that are shared between vaccine alleles and theoretically, increasing the number of component AMA1 alleles is expected to broaden the antibody response. A plateau effect could however impose a limit on the number of alleles needed to achieve the broadest specificity. Moreover, production cost and the vaccine formulation process would limit the number of component alleles. In this paper, we compare rabbit antibody responses elicited with multi-allele vaccines incorporating seven (three DiCos and four natural AMA1 alleles) and three (DiCo mix) antigens for gains in broadened specificity. We also investigate the effect of three adjuvant platforms on antigen specificity and antibody functionality. Our data confirms a broadened response after immunisation with DiCo mix in all three adjuvants. Higher antibody titres were elicited with either CoVaccine HT™ or Montanide ISA 51, resulting in similar in vitro inhibition (65-82%) of five out of six culture-adapted P. falciparum strains. The antigen binding specificities of elicited antibodies were also similar and independent of the adjuvant used or the number of vaccine component alleles. Thus neither the four extra antigens nor adjuvant had any observable benefits with respect to specificity broadening, although adjuvant choice influenced the absolute antibody levels and thus the extent of parasite inhibition. Our data confirms the feasibility and potential of multi-allele PfAMA1 formulations, and highlights the need for adjuvants with improved antibody potentiation properties for AMA1-based vaccines."

Both yeast and mammalian eIF6 are phosphorylated at Ser-174 and Ser-175 by the nuclear isoform of casein kinase 1 (CK1). The molecular basis of eIF6 phosphorylation, however, remains elusive. In the present work, we show that subcellular distribution of eIF6 in the nuclei and the cytoplasm of mammalian cells is mediated by dephosphorylation and phosphorylation, respectively. This nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling is dependent on the phosphorylation status at Ser-174 and Ser-175 of eIF6. We demonstrate that Ca2+-activated calcineurin phosphatase binds to and promotes nuclear localization of eIF6.

Nuclear export of eIF6 is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser-174 and Ser-175 by the nuclear isoform of CK1. Mutation of eIF6 at the phos-phorylatable Ser-174 and Ser-175 to alanine or treatment of cells with the CK1 inhibitor, D4476 inhibits nuclear export of eIF6 and results in nuclear accumulation of eIF6.

https://openalex.org/W2089910171,"Fibronectin is a principal component of the extracellular matrix. Soluble fibronectin molecules are assembled into the extracellular matrix as insoluble, fibrillar strands via a cell-dependent process. In turn, the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix form of fibronectin stimulates cell functions critical for tissue repair. Cross-talk between cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion complexes is essential for the organization of cells into complex, functional tissue during embryonic development and tissue remodeling. Here, we demonstrate that fibronectin matrix assembly affects the organization, composition, and function of N-cadherin-based adherens junctions. Using fibronectin-null mouse embryonic myofibroblasts, we identified a novel quaternary complex composed of N-cadherin, β-catenin, tensin, and actin that exists in the absence of a fibronectin matrix. In the absence of fibronectin, homophilic N-cadherin ligation recruited both tensin and α5β1 integrins into nascent cell-cell adhesions. Initiation of fibronectin matrix assembly disrupted the association of tensin and actin with N-cadherin, released α5β1 integrins and tensin from cell-cell contacts, stimulated N-cadherin reorganization into thin cellular protrusions, and decreased N-cadherin adhesion. Fibronectin matrix assembly has been shown to recruit α5β1 integrins and tensin into fibrillar adhesions. Taken together, these studies suggest that tensin serves as a common cytoskeletal link for integrin- and cadherin-based adhesions and that the translocation of α5β1 integrins from cell-cell contacts into fibrillar adhesions during fibronectin matrix assembly is a novel mechanism by which cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions are coordinated."
https://openalex.org/W2068053590,"Acylaminoacyl peptidase from Aeropyrum pernix is a homodimer that belongs to the prolyl oligopeptidase family. The monomer subunit is composed of one hydrolase and one propeller domain. Previous crystal structure determinations revealed that the propeller domain obstructed the access of substrate to the active site of both subunits. Here we investigated the structure and the kinetics of two mutant enzymes in which the aspartic acid of the catalytic triad was changed to alanine or asparagine. Using different substrates, we have determined the pH dependence of specificity rate constants, the rate-limiting step of catalysis, and the binding of substrates and inhibitors. The catalysis considerably depended both on the kind of mutation and on the nature of the substrate. The results were interpreted in terms of alterations in the position of the catalytic histidine side chain as demonstrated with crystal structure determination of the native and two mutant structures (D524N and D524A). Unexpectedly, in the homodimeric structures, only one subunit displayed the closed form of the enzyme. The other subunit exhibited an open gate to the catalytic site, thus revealing the structural basis that controls the oligopeptidase activity. The open form of the native enzyme displayed the catalytic triad in a distorted, inactive state. The mutations affected the closed, active form of the enzyme, disrupting its catalytic triad. We concluded that the two forms are at equilibrium and the substrates bind by the conformational selection mechanism."

This antioxidant activity is thought to result from the HO-1 enzymatic activity, manifested by a decrease in the concentration of the pro-oxidant substrate heme, and an increase in the antioxidant product bilirubin. Using a global transcriptional approach, and yeast as a model, we show that HO-1 affords cellular protection via up-regulation of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in cellular antioxidant defense, rather than via its oxygenase activity. Like mammalian cells, yeast responds to oxidative stress by expressing its HO-1 homolog and, compared with the wild type, heme oxygenase-null mutant cells have increased sensitivity toward oxidants that is rescued by overexpression of human HO-1 or its yeast homolog. Increased oxidant sensitivity of heme oxygenase-null mutant cells is explained by a decrease in the expression of the genes encoding γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and methionine sulfoxide reductase, because overexpression of any of these genes affords partial, and overexpression of all four genes provides complete, protection to the null mutant. Genes encoding antioxidant enzymes represent only a small portion of the 480 differentially expressed transcripts in heme oxygenase-null mutants.

Choi A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 583-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). The constitutively expressed HO-2 is implicated in oxygen sensing (5Williams S.E. Wootton P. Mason H.S. Bould J. Iles D.E. Riccardi D. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Science. 2004; 306: 2093-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and contains heme regulatory motifs that act as a thiol/disulfide redox switch, regulating the Kd for ferric heme (6Yi L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21056-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In most tissues HO-1 expression is induced in response to different types of stress, including oxidative stress, heat shock, and iron starvation (4Ryter S.W. Alam J. Choi A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 583-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). Increased expression of HO-1 is associated with a range of different cellular properties, including increased antioxidant protection and altered cell growth and signaling (4Ryter S.W. Alam J. Choi A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 583-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). In addition, there is mounting evidence suggesting that induction of HO-1 protects against various diseases (7Stocker R. Perrella M.A. Circulation. 2006; 114: 2178-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8Abraham N.G. Kappas A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 79-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar).Prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes possess homologs of mammalian HO-1. In the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the homolog Hmx1p was identified as a stress protein in response to iron deprivation (9Protchenko O. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36582-36587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and in a genome-wide transcriptional investigation of the activator of ferrous transport (AFT1) regulon (10Shakoury-Elizeh M. Tiedeman J. Rashford J. Ferea T. Demeter J. Garcia E. Rolfes R. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Aft1p is an iron-dependent transcription factor (11Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) that induces the expression of several genes, including HMX1, in response to iron limitation. Several lines of evidence support a role for Hmx1p in the regulation of heme and iron homeostasis in yeast. Deletion of HMX1 leads to the accumulation of heme and depletion of iron, as well as to the expression of FET3, a known Aft1p target gene that encodes a multi-copper oxidase (12Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and that forms part of a high affinity iron transport complex (13Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Loss of HMX1 also leads to the induction of CYC1 via the oxygen-sensing transcription factor Hap1p that itself is activated by heme (14Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heme acts as a positive and negative modulator of the transcription of aerobic and hypoxic genes, respectively (14Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It was recognized only recently that Hmx1p possesses classical heme oxygenase activity (15Kim D. Yukl E. Moënne-Loccoz P. Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14772-14780Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that in addition to regulating cellular heme and iron levels, Hmx1p may also share some of the additional activities of mammalian HO-1. Here, we show that Hmx1p indeed is induced in response to different stresses in addition to iron starvation, and that it protects yeast cells against oxidant challenge in a glutathione-dependent manner and via transcriptional regulation of genes encoding known enzymes involved in cellular antioxidant defense.DISCUSSIONThe ability of cells to respond to changes in environmental conditions, such as nutrient availability, determines their survival. Until now, Hmx1p, the yeast homolog of HO-1, was believed to be involved only in the cellular response to iron limitation (9Protchenko O. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36582-36587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that an additional role of Hmx1p is in the cellular response to and protection against oxidative stress. Our studies, for the first time, show that this antioxidant activity of heme oxygenase is dependent on the up-regulation of several genes encoding known antioxidant enzymes.Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that Hmx1p affords cellular antioxidant protection, and that this is via the transcriptional regulation of known antioxidant genes rather than its oxygenase activity. First, the expression of Hmx1p, like that of HO-1, is induced in cells exposed to different oxidants. Secondly, deletion of HMX1 renders cells more sensitive to oxidant challenge while overexpression of HMX1, like human HO-1, restores oxidant resistance of the hmx1-null mutant to that of wild-type cells. Thirdly, microarray analyses revealed GSH1, GPX1, CTT1, and MXR1 that encode well-established antioxidant defense enzymes to be down-regulated in the hmx1-null mutant compared with wild-type cells. Fourthly, overexpression of each of the down-regulated antioxidant genes partially rescues oxidant sensitivity of the hmx1-null mutant, while overexpression of all four down-regulated antioxidant genes provides complete protection to the null mutant. Furthermore, the levels of HMX1 transcript mirrored (at least in the case of total glutathione, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) the antioxidant activities of the genes down-regulated in the hmx1-null mutant. Therefore, changes to cellular glutathione and GSH-related antioxidant activities are likely key mechanisms by which Hmx1p protects cells against oxidants. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that in human cells one general mechanism of HO-1 induction is via modulation of cellular glutathione status (34Lautier D. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).It is now well established that HO-1 protects mammals against oxidative stress. For example, mice deficient in HO-1 have increased susceptibility to oxidative stress (35Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), and their cells are less capable to withstand an oxidative challenge than the corresponding wild-type cells (36Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), while HO-1 overexpression increases cellular resistance to oxidants (37Hori R. Kashiba M. Toma T. Yachie A. Goda N. Makino N. Soejima A. Nagasawa T. Nakabayashi K. Suematsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10712-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying the antioxidant protection provided by HO-1 is not well understood. Early studies ascribed the antioxidant action to the HO-1 ability to simultaneously decrease the concentrations of the pro-oxidant heme and increase the levels of the antioxidant bilirubin (38Stocker R. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1990; 9: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Bilirubin is an efficient oxidant scavenger in vitro (39Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2890) Google Scholar), and when added at micromolar concentrations both bilirubin and the HO-1 substrate hemin protect cells against oxidants (40Clark J.E. Foresti R. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, there is little direct evidence that bilirubin produced from endogenous heme as a consequence of increased HO-1 activity acts as a cellular antioxidant (41Stocker R. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and the amounts and sources of cellular heme available for degradation by HO-1 remain unknown. Indeed, addition of the products of heme oxygenase, biliverdin, and CO, had no measurable effect on the sensitivity of the hmx1-null mutant to H2O2 challenge (Fig. 9). Together, our results indicate that the antioxidant protection afforded by the yeast homolog of HO-1 is via an adaptive response that involves the transcriptional control of antioxidant genes, rather than directly via its oxygenase activity (Fig. 11). Transcriptional regulation by Hmx1p was observed with millimolar concentrations of H2O2, raising the question of physiological relevance. However, extrapolating oxidant concentrations from yeast to mammalian cells is complicated because of several species differences, including the oxidant resistance of the cell wall compared with plasma membrane (42Sousa-Lopes A. Antunes F. Cyrne L. Marinho H.S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and redundancies in H2O2 metabolism (29Grant C.M. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).In addition to catalyzing heme degradation and providing antioxidant protection, it is increasingly appreciated that HO-1 participates in the regulation of many biological processes, including inflammation, cell growth, vascular tone, and angiogenesis (4Ryter S.W. Alam J. Choi A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 583-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar) that can translate into protection against various diseases (7Stocker R. Perrella M.A. Circulation. 2006; 114: 2178-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 43Yachie A. Niida Y. Wada T. Igarashi N. Kaneda H. Toma T. Ohta K. Kasahara Y. Koizumi S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 44Deshane J. Chen S. Caballero S. Grochot-Przeczek A. Was H. Li Calzi S. Lach R. Hock T.D. Chen B. Hill-Kapturczak N. Siegal G.P. Dulak J. Jozkowicz A. Grant M.B. Agarwal A. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This raises the intriguing question of how HO-1 achieves these various activities. Using a global microarray analysis approach and yeast as a model, our studies revealed an unexpectedly large number of heme oxygenase-dependent, differentially expressed genes, the products of which are involved in several previously unrecognized processes, such as RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, transcriptional regulation, and membrane transport (Fig. 4). In fact, of the differentially expressed genes, only a small number, corresponding to ∼1%, relate to antioxidant defense. This indicates that at least in yeast, antioxidant protection may represent a relatively minor function of heme oxygenase, and that the enzyme likely participates in many presently unappreciated processes. For example, consistent with a regulatory role of HO-1 in the growth of mammalian cells, loss of HMX1 increased the growth of yeast cells, and this was abrogated by overexpression of HMX1 (not shown). This may relate to the differentially expressed genes involved in RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (supplemental Tables S3 and S4). The down-regulation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in sulfur metabolism has been linked to increased oxidative stress (45Wu C.Y. Roje S. Sandoval F.J. Bird A.J. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27544-27556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and hence may help explain the oxidant sensitivity of the hmx1 mutant. Likewise, mammalian HO-1 has been reported to affect the activity of transcription factors (32Lin Q. Weis S. Yang G. Weng Y.H. Helston R. Rish K. Smith A. Bordner J. Polte T. Gaunitz F. Dennery P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20621-20633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), so that the down-regulation of transcription factors may help explain the inability of the hmx1 mutant to mount an adequate response to oxidative stress.Our microarray analyses also raise the question of how an ER protein can participate in transcriptional regulation. One possibility is that diffusible product(s) of heme oxygenase activity are involved. Indeed, a recent report suggested that in cardiomyocytes HO-1-derived CO regulates mitochondrial biogenesis via transcriptional regulation of nuclear respiratory factor-1 (46Piantadosi C.A. Carraway M.S. Babiker A. Suliman H.B. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 1232-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Inconsistent with this notion, however, transfection of cells with a mutant HO-1 that lacks enzymatic activity still increased cellular resistance to H2O2 (37Hori R. Kashiba M. Toma T. Yachie A. Goda N. Makino N. Soejima A. Nagasawa T. Nakabayashi K. Suematsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10712-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and we observed no protective effect of CO on the sensitivity of the hmx1-null mutant to H2O2 challenge (Fig. 9). We note however that our experimental design may not have adequately reflected local production of biliverdin/CO, perhaps close to or within the nucleus. An alternative explanation for the ability of HO-1 to regulate gene transcription has been provided by Dennery and co-workers (32Lin Q. Weis S. Yang G. Weng Y.H. Helston R. Rish K. Smith A. Bordner J. Polte T. Gaunitz F. Dennery P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20621-20633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) who reported that a C terminus truncated form of HO-1 migrates to the nucleus in response to hypoxia, hemin, and heme-hemopexin. We observed that in oxidant-stressed yeast cells, Hmx1p localized to the (peri)nuclear region where it could conceivably participate in the transcriptional regulation. We observed greater (peri)nuclear localization with N terminus than C terminus tagged Hmx1p, suggesting that translocation to the perinuclear region may precede cleavage. However, our results do not unambiguously establish nuclear localization or cleavage of Hmx1p. Indeed, integral ER proteins can enter the nucleus without a need for proteolytic cleavage (33King M.C. Lusk C.P. Blobel G. Nature. 2006; 442: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Clearly, additional studies are required to elucidate the mechanism by which Hmx1p affects transcriptional regulation.In summary, our data show that in yeast the HO-1 homolog provides antioxidant protection to cells indirectly via the differential expression and activities of several known antioxidant enzymes. Our findings challenge the paradigm that the cellular/biological effects of HO-1 are explained solely by its enzymatic activity. Instead, they suggest that at least some of the HO-1 cellular/biological effects are the result of an adaptive response by the cells (Fig. 11). Clearly, HMX1 regulates the expression of a large number of genes involved in numerous functions unrelated to heme oxygenase or antioxidant activities. Elucidating the relationship of heme oxygenase with these differentially expressed genes will likely unravel a multitude of novel functions of HO-1. IntroductionHeme oxygenase degrades heme to CO, Fe2+, and biliverdin (1Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) 3The abbreviations used are: HO-1heme oxygenase-1CTT1gene encoding cytosolic catalaseGPX1gene encoding a glutathione peroxidase that acts on phospholipid hydroperoxides/non-phospholipid and other organic peroxidesGPX2gene encoding an atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxinGSH1gene encoding γ-glutamylcysteine synthetaseHA-HMX1pN-terminus HA-tagged Hmx1pHmx1pyeast heme oxygenase proteinHMX1gene encoding yeast heme oxygenaseHMX1-HApC terminus tagged Hmx1pMXR1gene encoding peptide methionine sulfoxide reductaseH2O2hydrogen peroxide. and HO-2 that share 43% amino acid sequence homology (2Cruse I. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3348-3353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with HO-2, HO-1 has a lower apparent Km-value for heme (3Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Kutty R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the two enzymes are regulated differently and exhibit different physiological properties (4Ryter S.W. Alam J. Choi A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 583-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). The constitutively expressed HO-2 is implicated in oxygen sensing (5Williams S.E. Wootton P. Mason H.S. Bould J. Iles D.E. Riccardi D. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Science. 2004; 306: 2093-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and contains heme regulatory motifs that act as a thiol/disulfide redox switch, regulating the Kd for ferric heme (6Yi L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21056-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In most tissues HO-1 expression is induced in response to different types of stress, including oxidative stress, heat shock, and iron starvation (4Ryter S.W. Alam J. Choi A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 583-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). Increased expression of HO-1 is associated with a range of different cellular properties, including increased antioxidant protection and altered cell growth and signaling (4Ryter S.W. Alam J. Choi A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 583-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). In addition, there is mounting evidence suggesting that induction of HO-1 protects against various diseases (7Stocker R. Perrella M.A. Circulation. 2006; 114: 2178-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8Abraham N.G. Kappas A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 79-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar).Prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes possess homologs of mammalian HO-1. In the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the homolog Hmx1p was identified as a stress protein in response to iron deprivation (9Protchenko O. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36582-36587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and in a genome-wide transcriptional investigation of the activator of ferrous transport (AFT1) regulon (10Shakoury-Elizeh M. Tiedeman J. Rashford J. Ferea T. Demeter J. Garcia E. Rolfes R. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Aft1p is an iron-dependent transcription factor (11Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) that induces the expression of several genes, including HMX1, in response to iron limitation. Several lines of evidence support a role for Hmx1p in the regulation of heme and iron homeostasis in yeast. Deletion of HMX1 leads to the accumulation of heme and depletion of iron, as well as to the expression of FET3, a known Aft1p target gene that encodes a multi-copper oxidase (12Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and that forms part of a high affinity iron transport complex (13Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Loss of HMX1 also leads to the induction of CYC1 via the oxygen-sensing transcription factor Hap1p that itself is activated by heme (14Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heme acts as a positive and negative modulator of the transcription of aerobic and hypoxic genes, respectively (14Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It was recognized only recently that Hmx1p possesses classical heme oxygenase activity (15Kim D. Yukl E. Moënne-Loccoz P. Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14772-14780Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that in addition to regulating cellular heme and iron levels, Hmx1p may also share some of the additional activities of mammalian HO-1. Here, we show that Hmx1p indeed is induced in response to different stresses in addition to iron starvation, and that it protects yeast cells against oxidant challenge in a glutathione-dependent manner and via transcriptional regulation of genes encoding known enzymes involved in cellular antioxidant defense."
https://openalex.org/W2168710841,"In the absence of x-ray structures of sodium and calcium channels their homology models are used to rationalize experimental data and design new experiments. A challenge is to model the outer-pore region that folds differently from potassium channels. Here we report a new model of the outer-pore region of the NaV1.4 channel, which suggests roles of highly conserved residues around the selectivity filter. The model takes from our previous study (Tikhonov, D. B., and Zhorov, B. S. (2005) Biophys. J. 88, 184-197) the general disposition of the P-helices, selectivity filter residues, and the outer carboxylates, but proposes new intra- and inter-domain contacts that support structural stability of the outer pore. Glycine residues downstream from the selectivity filter are proposed to participate in knob-into-hole contacts with the P-helices and S6s. These contacts explain the adapted tetrodotoxin resistance of snakes that feed on toxic prey through valine substitution of isoleucine in the P-helix of repeat IV. Polar residues five positions upstream from the selectivity filter residues form H-bonds with the ascending-limb backbones. Exceptionally conserved tryptophans are engaged in inter-repeat H-bonds to form a ring whose π-electrons would facilitate passage of ions from the outer carboxylates to the selectivity filter. The outer-pore model of CaV1.2 derived from the NaV1.4 model is also stabilized by the ring of exceptionally conservative tryptophans and H-bonds between the P-helices and ascending limbs. In this model, the exceptionally conserved aspartate downstream from the selectivity-filter glutamate in repeat II facilitates passage of calcium ions to the selectivity-filter ring through the tryptophan ring. Available experimental data are discussed in view of the models."
https://openalex.org/W1986470380,"Although bile acids are crucial for the absorption of lipophilic nutrients in the intestine, they are cytotoxic at high concentrations and can cause liver damage and promote colorectal carcinogenesis. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which is activated by bile acids and abundantly expressed in enterohepatic tissues, plays a crucial role in maintaining bile acids at safe concentrations. Here, we show that FXR induces expression of Akr1b7 (aldo-keto reductase 1b7) in murine small intestine, colon, and liver by binding directly to a response element in the Akr1b7 promoter. We further show that AKR1B7 metabolizes 3-keto bile acids to 3β-hydroxy bile acids that are less toxic to cultured cells than their 3α-hydroxy precursors. These findings reveal a feed-forward, protective pathway operative in murine enterohepatic tissues wherein FXR induces AKR1B7 to detoxify bile acids."
https://openalex.org/W1992568804,"DNA polymerases catalyze the incorporation of deoxynucleoside triphosphates into a growing DNA chain using a pair of Mg(2+) ions, coordinated at the active site by two invariant aspartates, whose removal by mutation typically reduces the polymerase activity to barely detectable levels. Using two stopped-flow fluorescence assays that we developed previously, we have investigated the role of the carboxylate ligands, Asp(705) and Asp(882), of DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) in the early prechemistry steps that prepare the active site for catalysis. We find that neither carboxylate is required for an early conformational transition, reported by a 2-aminopurine probe, that takes place in the open ternary complex after binding of the complementary dNTP. However, the subsequent fingers-closing step requires Asp(882); this step converts the open ternary complex into the closed conformation, creating the active-site geometry required for catalysis. Crystal structures indicate that the Asp(882) position changes very little during fingers-closing; this side chain may therefore serve as an anchor point to receive the dNTP-associated metal ion as the nucleotide is delivered into the active site. The Asp(705) carboxylate is not required until after the fingers-closing step, and we suggest that its role is to facilitate the entry of the second Mg(2+) into the active site. The two early prechemistry steps that we have studied take place normally at very low Mg(2+) concentrations, although higher concentrations are needed for covalent nucleotide addition, consistent with the second metal ion entering the ternary complex after fingers-closing."
https://openalex.org/W2062008127,"The epithelial Na(+) channel ENaC is a key player in the maintenance of whole body Na(+) balance, and consequently of blood pressure. It is tightly regulated by numerous signaling pathways including ubiquitylation via the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2. This mechanism is itself under the control of several kinases, which phosphorylate Nedd4-2, thereby interfering with ENaC/Nedd4-2 interaction, or by Usp2-45, which binds to and deubiquitylates ENaC. Another, different regulatory mechanism concerns the proteolytic activation of ENaC, during which the channel is cleaved on its luminal side by intracellular convertases such as furin, and further activated by extracellular proteases such as CAP-1. This process is regulated as well but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Previously, evidence was provided that the ubiquitylation status of ENaC may affect the cleavage of the channel. When ubiquitylation of ENaC was reduced, either by co-expressing Usp2-45, or mutating either the ENaC PY-motifs (i.e. the binding sites for Nedd4-2) or intracellular lysines (i.e. ubiquitylation sites), the level of channel cleavage was increased. Here we demonstrate that lysine-mutated ENaC channels are not ubiquitylated at the cell surface, are preferentially cleaved, and Usp2-45 does not affect their cleavage efficiency. We further show by limited proteolysis that the intracellular ubiquitylation status of ENaC affects the extracellular conformation of αENaC, by demonstrating that non-ubiquitylated channels are more efficiently cleaved when treated with extracellularly added trypsin or chymotrypsin. These results present a new paradigm in which an intracellular, post-translational modification (e.g. ubiquitylation) of a transmembrane protein can affect its extracellular conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2057987076,"Mdm2 and Mdmx are oncoproteins that have essential yet nonredundant roles in development and function as part of a multicomponent ubiquitinating complex that targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. However, in response to DNA damage, Mdm2 and Mdmx are phosphorylated and protect p53 through various mechanisms. It has been predicted that Mdm2-Mdmx complex formation modulates Mdm2 ligase activity, yet the mechanism that promotes formation of Mdm2-Mdmx complexes is unknown. Here, we show that optimal Mdm2-Mdmx complex formation requires c-Abl phosphorylation of Mdm2 both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, Abl phosphorylation of Mdm2 is required for efficient ubiquitination of Mdmx in vitro, and eliminating c-Abl signaling, using c-Abl(-/-) knock-out murine embryonic fibroblasts, led to a decrease in Mdmx ubiquitination. Further, p53 levels are not induced as efficiently in c-Abl(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts following DNA damage. Overall, these results define a direct link between genotoxic stress-activated c-Abl kinase signaling and Mdm2-Mdmx complex formation. Our results add an important regulatory mechanism for the activation of p53 in response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2116718060,"G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) plays a fundamental role in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and changes in GRK2 expression levels can have an important impact on cell functions. GRK2 is known to be degraded by the proteasome pathway. We have shown previously that β-arrestins participate in enhanced kinase turnover upon GPCR stimulation by facilitating GRK2 phosphorylation by c-Src or by MAPK or by recruiting the Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase to the receptor complex. In this report, we have investigated how such diverse β-arrestin scaffold functions are integrated to modulate GRK2 degradation. Interestingly, we found that in the absence of GPCR activation, β-arrestins do not perform an adaptor role for GRK2/Mdm2 association, but rather compete with GRK2 for direct Mdm2 binding to regulate basal kinase turnover. Upon agonist stimulation, β-arrestins-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2 at serine 670 by MAPK facilitates Mdm2-mediated GRK2 degradation, whereas c-Src-dependent phosphorylation would support the action of an undetermined β-arrestin-recruited ligase in the absence of GPCR activation. The ability of β-arrestins to play different scaffold functions would allow coordination of both Mdm2-dependent and -independent processes aimed at the specific modulation of GRK2 turnover in different signaling contexts."

Plasmodium blood stages translocate newly synthesized proteins outside the parasitophorous vacuole and direct them to various erythrocyte compartments, including the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. Here, we show that the remodeling of the host cell directed by the parasite also includes the recruitment of dematin, an actin-binding protein of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton and its repositioning to the parasite. Internalized dematin was found associated with Plasmodium 14-3-3, which belongs to a family of conserved multitask molecules. We also show that, in vitro, the dematin-14-3-3 interaction is strictly dependent on phosphorylation of dematin at Ser(124) and Ser(333), belonging to two 14-3-3 putative binding motifs.

These compounds represent chemical matter that may provide essential scaffolds that could be altered with modern medicinal chemical approaches or may be suitable to be reintroduced into the clinic in this current era of pressing need. For example, the lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin (Cubicin®) was discovered in the 1980s by Eli Lilly but was not brought to the clinic until 2003 because of the efforts by Cubist Pharmaceuticals, which resulted in Food and Drug Administration approval of this older drug (1Eisenstein B.I. Oleson Jr., F.B. Baltz R.H. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2010; 50: S10-S15Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Currently analogs of the known aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin and kanamycin are not seen as favorable drug candidates by the pharmaceutical industry. Discovered in the 1950s, these compounds were acclaimed for their broad spectrum and potent bactericidal activity. However, they lost favor as front line drugs as a result of toxicity and poor oral availability and as newer agents with improved pharmacology entered the market. Furthermore, the emergence of resistance provided an additional challenge to the clinical utility of these drugs. Resistance to these antibiotics is most frequently conferred by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes encoded by transferable gene cassettes. Nevertheless, in this era of acute antibiotic need, the aminoglycoside compounds, particularly the ones that were clinically “underused” in the past, are re-emerging as promising drug leads. This in turn necessitates the detailed analysis of mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycosides as an essential part of developing antimicrobial therapies involving this class of antibiotics. Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes act through three major chemical mechanisms: acetyltransfer, nucleotidyltransfer, and phosphoryltransfer. Each of these classes of enzymes is highly diverse, with numerous representatives featuring different substrate profiles and regiochemical selectivities resulting in a plethora of enzymes with varied and distinct features. The ∼30 enzymes within the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase class of enzymes typically show less than 35% pairwise identities (2Wright G.D. Thompson P.R. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D9-D21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hygromycin B (hygB), 4The abbreviations used are: APHaminoglycoside phosphotransferasehygBhygromycin BAMPPNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateAMPPCPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphateNPLnucleotide positioning loop. isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus (3Pittenger R.C.

It has atypical chemical features in comparison with more common representatives of this antibiotic class. A key structural feature of these common aminoglycosides is the 2-deoxystreptamine core, which is substituted by two amino sugar rings at the 4 and 6 positions (as in gentamicin or tobramycin), or the 4 and 5 positions (as in neomycin or butirosin). hygB is unique in that it is comprised of an N-methyl 2-deoxystreptamine ring (hyosamine), linked through the C5-OH to a talose sugar, which in turn forms an orthoester with the unusual amino acid destomic acid (Fig. 1), resulting in a distinctive fused ring structure. This unique structure translates into a novel mode of action. Where antibiotics like gentamicin bind to the 30 S ribosomal subunit, resulting in mistranslation of mRNA, hygB binding to this subunit primarily blocks mRNA and tRNA translocation (4Borovinskaya M.A. Shoji S.

Like all antibiotics, resistance to hygB has emerged. Plasmid-encoded hygB resistance in Escherichia coli was reported some 30 years following its introduction (7Gritz L. Davies J.

This resistance was linked to the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-(4)-Ia (APH(4)-Ia) enzyme, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the hydroxyl moiety on C4 of the hyosamine ring (Ring I) of hygB (Fig. 1) (8Rao R.N.

This mechanism differs from the self-protection one described in the hygB-producing S. hygroscopicus, which involves phosphorylation at the 7″-OH of the destomic acid ring (Ring IV) (9Pardo J.M.

This implies that APH(4)-Ia may have evolved distinctly from self-resistance in the producing organism. The three-dimensional structures of a number of APHs have been reported (11Fong D.H. Lemke C.T.

These structures have demonstrated that despite their sequence diversity, APH enzymes share a common fold that is similar to that of eukaryotic protein kinases. This common fold features a bilobed structure comprised of a primarily β-sheet-containing N-terminal domain and a mixed α+β C-terminal domain, with the two domains connected by a linker region. Relative to eukaryotic protein kinases, APH enzymes contain an insertion in the C-terminal domain, which plays an important role in aminoglycoside binding (12Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Despite structural information about a number of APH enzymes and advances in understanding the mechanism of phosphorylation reaction (16McKay G.A. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8680-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the basis of different substrate specificity toward diverse aminoglycosides between the representatives of APH enzymes remains poorly understood. Low sequence similarity between APH enzymes precludes effective modeling of uncharacterized APH family members and necessitates further structural studies of diverse members of this family. Given the importance of hygB as a potential scaffold for new drug discovery, we embarked on structural characterization of the APH(4)-Ia·hygB binary complex and investigated the enzymatic properties of this enzyme. The three-dimensional structure shows that although the APH(4)-Ia enzyme adopts the general features of other APH enzymes, such as the overall eukaryotic protein kinase-like fold and the location of the hygB ligand-binding site, it reveals unique structural features that explain its selectivity for this atypical aminoglycoside. The aph(4)-Ia gene (NCBI accession number V01499) from the retroviral protein expression vector pQCXIH (Clontech) was used as the template for preparation of an overexpressing construct. An internal NdeI restriction endonuclease site was removed by creating a silent mutation at the site using the Stratagene QuikChange strategy (oligonucleotide primers are shown in supplemental Table S1). The gene was then amplified with oligonucleotide primers that introduced flanking 5′ NdeI and 3′ HindIII sites that were used to clone the gene into vector pET28a to create the expression plasmid pET-APH(4)-Ia. APH(4)-Ia was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and grown overnight in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin A in Luria Bertani (LB) broth. A 10-ml overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh LB broth with antibiotic selection and was grown to OD600 ∼0.6 at 37 °C. It was then induced for 16 h at 16 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 15 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pancreatic bovine DNase. The resuspended pellet was passed through a T-S series cell disrupter (Constant Systems Inc.) twice at 35,000 p.s.i. to create a lysate. The insoluble and soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was then applied to a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) equilibrated in 10 column volumes of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole (Buffer A). A stepwise gradient over five column volumes of each 10, 25, 50, and 100% Buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole) was used to elute the enzyme. The APH(4)-Ia-containing fractions were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were subsequently pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, overnight at 4 °C with stirring. The protein was then quantified using the Bradford protein assay and was either concentrated or diluted to 0.5 mg/ml and stored in 15% glycerol at −20 °C. For crystallographic purposes, the aph(4)-Ia gene was subcloned from pET-APH(4)-Ia into the vector p15Tv-LIC, which codes for a N-terminal His6 tag, a TEV protease cleavage site, and an ampicillin resistance gene and allows ligase-independent cloning. The expression vector was utilized for expression of selenomethionine-substituted protein using standard M9 high yield growth procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions (Shanghai Medicilon; catalog number MD045004-50), with E. coli BL21(DE3) codon plus cells. The cells were lysed by sonication in 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine, and 0.25 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Protein was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin at 4 °C for 2 h, washed with lysis buffer with 30 mm imidazole, and then eluted with lysis buffer with 250 mm imidazole. Eluted protein was supplemented with 1 mm EDTA. The His6 tag was removed by cleavage with TEV protease overnight at 4 °C in dialysis with the buffer 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine, followed by binding to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and capture of flow-through. Protein was concentrated to at least 10 mg/ml. Protein was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. APH(4)-Ia crystals were grown at 22 °C using the hanging drop method, by mixing 1 μl of protein at 6.5 mg/ml with 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.2 m diammonium hydrogen citrate, 16% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 2 mm hygB. The crystals were cryo-protected with reservoir solution supplemented with 20% paratone prior to flash freezing. Diffraction data at 100 K at the wavelength corresponding to the anomalous scattering peak wavelength of selenomethionine (0.97915 Å) were collected at Beamline 19-BM at the Structural Biology Center, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction data were reduced with HKL2000 (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymology. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion using the AutoSol module of Phenix (18Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R. Read R.J. Richardson D.C. Richardson J.S. Terwilliger T.C. Zwart P.H. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16573) Google Scholar). Seven of the eight selenomethionine sites in the asymmetric unit were found as judged by occupancy values greater than 0.50. An initial model of the protein was built using Phenix AutoBuild, followed by rounds of manual model building and refinement with Coot (19Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar) and Phenix.refine. Final rounds of refinement were completed with BUSTER (20Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) with TLS parameterization (TLS groups were residues 8–99 and 100–301). The final atomic model includes residues 8–301 of APH(4)-Ia, all 25 atoms of hygB, 27 ammonium ions, one chloride ion, and seven polyethylene glycol molecules (with varying numbers of atoms per polyethylene glycol molecule visible in the electron density). Procheck (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was utilized for the Ramachandran analysis. An iterative composite omit map for verification of position of hygB was generated with Phenix.autobuild with default parameters. Structure similarity searches of the Protein Data Bank were performed using the Dali server (22Holm L. Kääriäinen S. Rosenström P. Schenkel A. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2780-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Structure superpositions were performed with the SSM algorithm in Coot or the Dali server as indicated in the manuscript. Interactions between the protein and hygB were identified in Coot and also using the LIGPLOT program (23Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4368) Google Scholar). Electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated using the APBS PyMOL plugin (24Petrey D. Honig B. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 492-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Red is negative, white is neutral, blue is positively charged, and surfaces were contoured between −20 and +20 kBT/e, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and e is the electronic charge. Protein structure images were produced with PyMOL (Delano Scientific). The structure of APH(4)-Ia has been submitted to the Protein Data Bank with the accession number 3OVC. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Stratagene QuikChange strategy in the pET-APH(4)-Ia plasmid. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers can be found in supplemental Table S1. DNA sequencing using primers for the T7 promoter and terminator were used to verify the success of the mutants. All of the mutants were purified as described previously above. The phosphorylation of antibiotics was monitored by coupling the release of ADP or GDP following antibiotic modification with pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (25Pon N.G. Bondar R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 19: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The oxidization of NADH (ϵ = 6220 m−1 cm−1) was monitored at 340 nm using a SpectraMax plate reader in a 96-well format. A typical reaction contained 195 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm NADH, 3.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.00125 units pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase, and ∼0.1 μm APH(4)-Ia). A 5-μl solution of the appropriate antibiotic was added to the reaction and allowed to incubate for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction was initiated with a 50-μl solution of nucleotide and monitored for 5 min at 340 nm. The initial rates (v) were determined by utilizing the linear portion of the progress curve and analyzed by nonlinear least squares fitting to Equation 1.v=VmaxS/(KM+S)(Eq. 1) Large scale preparation of phosphohygromycin B was carried out enzymatically using a 50-ml reaction comprised of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm hygB, 5.4 mm ATP, and 2.1 μm APH(4)-Ia. The reaction was monitored using thin layer chromatography with a mobile phase comprised of 5:2 MeOH:NH4OH and visualized with ninhydrin. The reaction mixture was passed through a 0.2-μm Millipore filter and a 10-kDa Millipore centrifugal filter to remove precipitated and soluble enzyme, respectively. The filtrate was then lyophilized overnight and resuspended in 4 ml of H2O and applied to a 48-ml AG50W × 8 200–400 mesh column (78 × 28 mm) that had been charged with 1% NH4OH. The product was recovered with a wash of 0.1% NH4OH and lyophilized. Previous enzyme-based assays indicated that APH(4)-Ia is highly specific for hygromycin B and close analogs (8Rao R.N. Allen N.E. Hobbs Jr., J.N. Alborn Jr., W.E. Kirst H.A. Paschal J.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1983; 24: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Using purified recombinant APH(4)-Ia, we screened a diverse panel of aminoglycoside antibiotics as potential substrates including the 4,6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamine-based aminoglycosides (amikacin, kanamycin A, gentamicin C complex, and tobramycin), the 4,5-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamine-based aminoglycosides (butirosin, neomycin B, paromomycin, ribostamycin, and lividomycin) and the atypical aminoglycosides (neamine, apramycin, streptomycin, spectinomycin, and hygromycin B). Only hygB was susceptible to phosphorylation by APH(4)-Ia (see Table 2). Such narrow substrate specificity is unusual for APHs, which often have very broad aminoglycoside substrate profiles (26Daigle D.M. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 99-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D.

In contrast, APH(4)-Ia demonstrated the ability to utilize both ATP and GTP as a phosphate donor with ∼5-fold preference toward ATP based upon the kcat/Km values of 5.42 × 104 and 1.04 × 104, respectively. Similar nucleotide promiscuity has been previously observed for the APH(2″) class of enzymes (31Shakya T. Wright G.D. Antimicrob.

In eukaryotic protein kinases, the capacity to utilize GTP is rare, and this difference could be exploited in the development of specific inhibitors.TABLE 2Kinetic constants of APH(4)-Ia mutantsEnzymeSubstrate testedKmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1s−1 m−1Wild-typehygB6.8 ± 1.13.184.68 × 105ATP57.2 ± 7.23.105.42 × 104GTP339 ± 433.531.04 × 104R49AhygB3.7 ± 0.30.371.00 × 105ATP1708 ± 6770.844.93 × 102Q101AhygB34.5 ± 1.84.211.22 × 105ATP314 ± 115.111.63 × 104D126AhygB3.5 ± 0.71.363.89 × 105ATP31 ± 3.41.173.77 × 104D198AhygBNo activityATPNo activityS201AhygB15 ± 4.63.752.50 × 105ATP96.3 ± 6.73.733.88 × 104N203AhygBNo activityATPNo activityD216AhygBNo activityATPNo activityN231AhygB18 ± 2.42.131.18 × 105ATP73 ± 9.02.182.99 × 104W238LhygB7 ± 2.12.683.83 × 105ATP52.2 ± 6.22.404.59 × 104Q273AhygB11.2 ± 1.62.772.48 × 105ATP255 ± 153.281.29 × 104D285AhygB12.6 ± 13.222.55 × 105ATP70.5 ± 8.03.194.52 × 104 Open table in a new tab High resolution mass spectrometry of phosphorylated hygB gave a mass of 607.1990 consistent with monophosphorylation of hygB.

To gain further understanding of the unique substrate selectivity of this enzyme, the structure of APH(4)-Ia was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using selenomethionine-derivatized APH(4)-Ia protein co-crystallized with hygB. The final model contained one polypeptide chain in the asymmetric unit, with residues 8–301 resolved in the electron density, along with all atoms of the antibiotic (structure statistics are summarized in Table 1).TABLE 1X-ray diffraction data collection and structure refinement statisticsAPH(4)-Ia + hygB (3OVC)Data collectionWavelength (Å)0.9798 (peak)Resolution range (Å)50.0–1.95Space groupP 32 2a = b (Å)70.64c (Å)125.88Rmerge0.068 (0.697)aThe values in parentheses refer to highest resolution shell of 1.98–1.95 Å.<I>/σI52.2 (3.46)Completeness (%)99.9 (100)Redundancy10.3 (7.6)RefinementResolution range (Å)23.54–1.95Number of reflectionsWorking set25,785Test set1360Rwork/RfreebRfree was calculated by randomly omitting 5% of the observed reflections from the refinement.0.176/0.218Number of non-hydrogen atomsProtein2330Substrate25Ion/solvent131Water249Root mean square deviationBond length (Å)0.010Bond angle (°)0.98Average thermal factor (Å2)Protein38.6Substrate29.6Ion/solvent52.8Water48.2Ramachandran analysis (%)Most favored regions regions92.1Additionally allowed regions7.5Generously allowed regions0.4Disallowed regionscAccording to the Ramachandran plot in Procheck (21).0a The values in parentheses refer to highest resolution shell of 1.98–1.95 Å.b Rfree was calculated by randomly omitting 5% of the observed reflections from the refinement.c According to the Ramachandran plot in Procheck (21Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab The analysis of the APH(4)-Ia structure demonstrated that like previously characterized APH enzymes, APH(4)-Ia adopts a general eukaryotic protein kinase fold.

https://openalex.org/W2162502716,"Diabetic tissues are enriched in an “activated” form of human aldose reductase (hAR), a NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase involved in sugar metabolism. Activated hAR has reduced sensitivity to potential anti-diabetes drugs. The C298S mutant of hAR reproduces many characteristics of activated hAR, although it differs from wild-type hAR only by the replacement of a single sulfur atom with oxygen. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements revealed that the binding constant of NADPH to the C298S mutant is decreased by a factor of two, whereas that of NADP+ remains the same. Similarly, the heat capacity change for the binding of NADPH to the C298S mutant is twice increased; however, there is almost no difference in the heat capacity change for binding of the NADP+ to the C298S. X-ray crystal structures of wild-type and C298S hAR reveal that the side chain of residue 298 forms a gate to the nicotinamide pocket and is more flexible for cysteine compared with serine. Unlike Cys-298, Ser-298 forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr-209 across the nicotinamide ring, which inhibits movements of the nicotinamide. We hypothesize that the increased polarity of the oxidized nicotinamide weakens the hydrogen bond potentially formed by Ser-298, thus, accounting for the relatively smaller effect of the mutation on NADP+ binding. The effects of the mutant on catalytic rate constants and binding constants for various substrates are the same as for activated hAR. It is, thus, further substantiated that activated hAR arises from oxidative modification of Cys-298, a residue near the nicotinamide binding pocket. Diabetic tissues are enriched in an “activated” form of human aldose reductase (hAR), a NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase involved in sugar metabolism. Activated hAR has reduced sensitivity to potential anti-diabetes drugs. The C298S mutant of hAR reproduces many characteristics of activated hAR, although it differs from wild-type hAR only by the replacement of a single sulfur atom with oxygen. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements revealed that the binding constant of NADPH to the C298S mutant is decreased by a factor of two, whereas that of NADP+ remains the same. Similarly, the heat capacity change for the binding of NADPH to the C298S mutant is twice increased; however, there is almost no difference in the heat capacity change for binding of the NADP+ to the C298S. X-ray crystal structures of wild-type and C298S hAR reveal that the side chain of residue 298 forms a gate to the nicotinamide pocket and is more flexible for cysteine compared with serine. Unlike Cys-298, Ser-298 forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr-209 across the nicotinamide ring, which inhibits movements of the nicotinamide. We hypothesize that the increased polarity of the oxidized nicotinamide weakens the hydrogen bond potentially formed by Ser-298, thus, accounting for the relatively smaller effect of the mutation on NADP+ binding. The effects of the mutant on catalytic rate constants and binding constants for various substrates are the same as for activated hAR.

https://openalex.org/W2170295393,"Heparosan synthase catalyzes the polymerization of heparosan (-4GlcUAβ1-4GlcNAcα1-)(n) by transferring alternatively the monosaccharide units from UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc to an acceptor molecule. Details on the heparosan chain initiation by Pasteurella multocida heparosan synthase PmHS2 and its influence on the polymerization process have not been reported yet. By site-directed mutagenesis of PmHS2, the single action transferases PmHS2-GlcUA(+) and PmHS2-GlcNAc(+) were obtained. When incubated together in the standard polymerization conditions, the PmHS2-GlcUA(+)/PmHS2-GlcNAc(+) showed comparable polymerization properties as determined for PmHS2. We investigated the first step occurring in heparosan chain initiation by the use of the single action transferases and by studying the PmHS2 polymerization process in the presence of heparosan templates and various UDP-sugar concentrations. We observed that PmHS2 favored the initiation of the heparosan chains when incubated in the presence of an excess of UDP-GlcNAc. It resulted in a higher number of heparosan chains with a lower average molecular weight or in the synthesis of two distinct groups of heparosan chain length, in the absence or in the presence of heparosan templates, respectively. These data suggest that PmHS2 transfers GlcUA from UDP-GlcUA moiety to a UDP-GlcNAc acceptor molecule to initiate the heparosan polymerization; as a consequence, not only the UDP-sugar concentration but also the amount of each UDP-sugar is influencing the PmHS2 polymerization process. In addition, it was shown that PmHS2 hydrolyzes the UDP-sugars, UDP-GlcUA being more degraded than UDP-GlcNAc. However, PmHS2 incubated in the presence of both UDP-sugars favors the synthesis of heparosan polymers over the hydrolysis of UDP-sugars."
https://openalex.org/W2038613283,"Low extracellular pH (pHe) occurs in a number of clinical conditions and sensitizes to the development of pancreatitis. The mechanisms responsible for this sensitization are unknown. Because abnormal Ca(2+) signaling underlies many of the early steps in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis, we evaluated the effect of decreasing pHe from 7.4 to 7.0 on Ca(2+) signals in the acinar cell. Low pHe significantly increased the amplitude of cerulein-induced Ca(2+) signals. The enhancement in amplitude was localized to the basolateral region of the acinar cell and was reduced by pretreatment with ryanodine receptor (RYR) inhibitors. Because basolateral RYRs also have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis, we evaluated the effects of RYR inhibitors on pancreatitis responses in acidic conditions. RYR inhibitors significantly reduced the sensitizing effects of low pHe on zymogen activation and cellular injury. These findings suggest that enhanced RYR-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in the basolateral region of the acinar cell is responsible for the injurious effects of low pHe on the exocrine pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W2072006267,"Integrin transmembrane (TM) and/or cytoplasmic domains play a critical role in integrin bidirectional signaling. Although it has been shown that TM and/or cytoplasmic α and β domains associate in the resting state and separation of these domains is required for both inside-out and outside-in signaling, the role of TM homomeric association remains elusive. Formation of TM homo-oligomers was observed in micelles and bacterial membranes previously, and it has been proposed that homomeric association is important for integrin activation and clustering. This study addresses whether integrin TM domains form homo-oligomers in mammalian cell membranes using cysteine scanning mutagenesis. Our results show that TM homomeric interaction does not occur before or after soluble ligand binding or during inside-out activation. In addition, even though the cysteine mutants and the heterodimeric disulfide-bounded mutant could form clusters after adhering to immobilized ligand, the integrin TM domains do not form homo-oligomers, suggesting that integrin TM homomeric association is not critical for integrin clustering or outside-in signaling. Therefore, integrin TM homo-oligomerization is not required for integrin activation, ligand binding, or signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1966264233,"The nidogen-laminin interaction is proposed to play a key role in basement membrane (BM) assembly. However, though there are similarities, the phenotypes in mice lacking nidogen 1 and 2 (nidogen double null) differ to those of mice lacking the nidogen binding module (γ1III4) of the laminin γ1 chain. This indicates different cell- and tissue-specific functions for nidogens and their interaction with laminin and poses the question of whether the phenotypes in nidogen double null mice are caused by the loss of the laminin-nidogen interaction or rather by other unknown nidogen functions. To investigate this, we analyzed BMs, in particular those in the skin of mice lacking the nidogen binding module. In contrast to nidogen double null mice, all skin BMs in γ1III4-deficient mice appeared normal. Furthermore, although nidogen 1 deposition was strongly reduced, nidogen 2 appeared unchanged. Mice with additional deletion of the laminin γ3 chain, which contains a γ1-like nidogen binding module, showed a further reduction of nidogen 1 in the dermoepidermal BM; however, this again did not affect nidogen 2. This demonstrates that in vivo only nidogen 1 deposition is critically dependent on the nidogen binding modules of the laminin γ1 and γ3 chains, whereas nidogen 2 is independently recruited either by binding to an alternative site on laminin or to other BM proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2082686635,"Metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), the founding member of the MTA family of genes, can modulate transcription by influencing the status of chromatin remodeling. Despite its strong correlation with the metastatic potential of cancer cells, MTA1 can also regulate crucial cellular pathways by modifying the acetylation status. We have previously reported the presence of MTA1/MTA1 in human and mouse testes, providing the evidence for its involvement in the regulation of testicular function during murine spermatogenesis. The objective of present study was to further assess the localization of MTA1 in mouse epididymis on both transcriptional and translational level, and then to explore whether MTA1 expression is regulated by androgens and postnatal epididymal development.Mice were deprived of circulating androgen by bilaterally castration and were then supplemented with exogenous testosterone propionate for one week. MTA1 was immunolocalized in the epithelium of the entire epididymis with the maximal expression in the nuclei of principal cells and of clear cells in proximal region. Its expression decreased gradually after castration, whereas testosterone treatment could restore the expression, indicating that the expression of this gene is dependent on androgen. During postnatal development, the protein expression in the epididymis began to appear from day 7 to day 14, increased dramatically from postnatal day 28, and peaked at adulthood onwards, coinciding with both the well differentiated status of epididymis and the mature levels of circulating androgens. This region- and cell-specific pattern was also conservative in normal human epididymis.Our data suggest that the expression of MTA1 protein could be regulated by androgen pathway and its expression level is closely associated with the postnatal development of the epididymis, giving rise to the possibility that this gene plays a potential role in sperm maturation and fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2143867974,"Anticipation of resource availability is a vital skill yet it is poorly understood in terms of neuronal circuitry. Rodents display robust anticipatory activity in the several hours preceding timed daily access to food when access is limited to a short temporal duration. We tested whether this anticipatory behavior could be generalized to timed daily social interaction by examining if singly housed male mice could anticipate either a daily novel female or a familiar female. We observed that anticipatory activity was moderate under both conditions, although both a novel female partner and sexual experience are moderate contributing factors to increasing anticipatory activity. In contrast, restricted access to running wheels did not produce any anticipatory activity, suggesting that an increase in activity during the scheduled access time was not sufficient to induce anticipation. To tease apart social versus sexual interaction, we tested the effect of exposing singly housed female mice to a familiar companion female mouse daily. The female mice did not show anticipatory activity for restricted female access, despite a large amount of social interaction, suggesting that daily timed social interaction between mice of the same gender is insufficient to induce anticipatory activity. Our study demonstrates that male mice will show anticipatory activity, albeit inconsistently, for a daily timed sexual encounter."
https://openalex.org/W1980605766,"A growing body of evidence points toward activated fibroblasts, also known as myofibroblasts, as one of the leading mediators in several major human pathologies including proliferative fibrotic disorders, invasive tumor growth, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis. Niemann-Pick Type C2 (NPC2) protein has been recently identified as a product of the second gene in NPC disease. It encodes ubiquitous, highly conserved, secretory protein with the poorly defined function. Here we show that NPC2 deficiency in human fibroblasts confers their activation. The activation phenomenon was not limited to fibroblasts as it was also observed in aortic smooth muscle cells upon silencing NPC2 gene by siRNA. More importantly, activated synovial fibroblasts isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis were also identified as NPC2-deficient at both the NPC2 mRNA and protein levels. The molecular mechanism responsible for activation of NPC2-null cells was shown to be a sustained phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which fulfills both the sufficient and necessary fibroblast activation criteria. All of these findings highlight a novel mechanism where NPC2 by negatively regulating ERK 1/2 MAPK phosphorylation may efficiently suppress development of maladaptive tissue remodeling and inflammation."
