https://openalex.org/W2160777888,"The adult appendages of Drosophila are formed from imaginal discs, sheets of epithelial cells that proliferate during larval development and differentiate during metamorphosis. wingless (wg, DWnt-1) protein, a putative signaling molecule, is expressed only in prospective ventral cells in each of the leg discs. To test the role of wg, we have generated randomly positioned clones of cells that express wg protein constitutively. Clones that arise in the prospective ventral portions of the leg discs develop normally. In contrast, dorsally situated clones give rise to ventrolateral patterns and exert a ventralizing influence on neighboring wild-type tissue. We propose that wg protein organizes leg pattern along the dorsoventral axis by conferring ventral positional information within the disc."
https://openalex.org/W1980286364,"The developmental fates of subventricular zone (SVZ) cells of the postnatal rat forebrain were determined by retroviral-mediated gene transfer and immunolabeling for glial antigens. A beta-galactosidase-containing retrovirus injected stereotactically into the SVZ infected small, immature cells. By 28 days post-injection labeled cells had appeared in both gray and white matter of the ipsilateral hemisphere. White matter contained labeled oligodendrocytes, but few astrocytes, while neocortex and striatum contained both glial types, often appearing in tightly knit clusters. An analysis after simultaneously injecting alkaline phosphatase- and beta-galactosidase-containing retroviruses showed that cells in each cortical cluster were related. Most clusters contained a single cell type, but approximately 15% contained both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These observations strongly suggest that a single SVZ cell can differentiate into both glial types."
https://openalex.org/W2090162429,"Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcriptional activator, and IRF-2, its antagonistic repressor, have been identified as regulators of type I interferon and interferon-inducible genes. The IRF-1 gene is itself interferon-inducible and hence may be one of the target genes critical for interferon action. When the IRF-2 gene was overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells, the cells became transformed and displayed enhanced tumorigenicity in nude mice. This transformed phenotype was reversed by concomitant overexpression of the IRF-1 gene. Thus, restrained cell growth depends on a balance between these two mutually antagonistic transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2067669919,"The properties of many ligand-gated ion channels are altered during development. We have characterized a developmental switch in the sensitivity of NMDA receptors to the novel antagonist ifenprodil using ligand binding assays with rat brain membranes and voltage-clamp recording of Xenopus oocytes expressing NMDA receptors after injection of RNA from rat brain and from cloned subunits of the receptor. In neonatal rat brain, NMDA receptors have a uniformly high affinity for ifenprodil. During postnatal development, a second population of receptors having a 100-fold lower affinity for ifenprodil is expressed and represents 50% of NMDA receptors in adult rat brain. This developmental change also occurred in cortical neurons maintained in primary culture. Ifenprodil potently inhibited responses of homomeric NR1 and heteromeric NR1/NR2B receptors but not NR1/NR2A receptors expressed in oocytes, suggesting that inclusion of different NR2 subunits in native NMDA receptors can control the sensitivity to ifenprodil."
https://openalex.org/W2055952888,"One of the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in human leukemia and myelodysplasia is an interstitial deletion within chromosome 5q. A tumor suppressor gene has been hypothesized to lie in 5q31, the smallest commonly deleted region. IRF-1, a gene whose product manifests anti-oncogenic activity, was mapped to 5q31.1. IRF-1 lies between IL-5 and CDC25C and is centromeric to IL-3 and GM-CSF. Among these genes, only IRF-1 was consistently deleted at one or both alleles in 13 cases of leukemia or myelodysplasia with aberrations of 5q31. Inactivating rearrangements of one IRF-1 allele, accompanied by deletion of the second allele, were also identified in one case of acute leukemia. Thus, IRF-1 may be a critically deleted gene in human leukemia and myelodysplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2059524152,"The importance of intrinsic commitments and epigenetic influence to the development of mature neural cell phenotypes was assessed using embryonic day 10 murine neuroepithelial cells, isolated from telencephalon and mesencephalon. Two types of clones were generated with fibroblast growth factor: type-A clones consisted of large, amorphous cells, and type-B clones contained epithelial-like cells. In many type-B clones, very large numbers of precursor cells were produced. Twenty-four percent of type-B clones contained small numbers of neurons, and 59% of clones containing neurons also contained astrocytes, indicating that this clonal type was derived from a bipotential precursor cell. Neuronal differentiation was enhanced by culturing precursor cells with conditioned medium derived from an immortalized astroglial-like cell line. These results indicate that neuroepithelial precursors have discrete epigenetic requirements for their proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2136024488,"The protein-tyrosine kinases Trk, TrkB, and TrkC are signal-transducing receptors for a family of neurotrophic factors known as the neurotrophins. Here we show that seizures induced by hippocampal kindling lead to a rapid, transient increase of trkB mRNA and protein in the hippocampus. TrkB is a component of a high affinity receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). No change was detected in mRNAs for Trk or TrkC, components of the high affinity nerve growth factor or neurotrophin-3 receptors, respectively. trkB mRNA was also transiently increased in the dentate gyrus following cerebral ischemia and hypoglycemic coma; these treatments had no effect on trk and trkC mRNAs. The increase in trkB mRNA and protein showed the same time course and distribution as the increase in BDNF mRNA. These data suggest that BDNF and its receptor may play a local role within the hippocampus in kindling-associated neural plasticity and in neuronal protection following epileptic, ischemic, and hypoglycemic insults."
https://openalex.org/W2162695832,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) selectively induce mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) production in various cell types. We have evaluated the capacity of tumor cells that overexpress MnSOD to recover from the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of cytokines (IL-1 and TNF), chemotherapeutic agents, and ionizing irradiation. Clones of human melanoma cell line, A375, which overex-pressed MnSOD after sense MnSOD cDNA transfection, showed increased recovery from treatment with cytostatic and cytotoxic doses of IL-1α and TNFα, whereas clones of A375 cells that were transfected with anti-sense MnSOD cDNA recovered less well than normal cells from IL-1α and TNFα. In addition, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with sense MnSOD cDNA showed increased survival after treatment with doxorubicin, mitomycin C, and gamma (7) radiation in vitro. It is hypothesized that mitochondrial MnSOD, by scavenging oxygen radicals induced by cytokines, some cytotoxic drugs, and ionizing radiation, is protective and promotes the survival of cells from the lethal effects of these treatments.— Hirose, K., Longo, D. L., Oppenheim, J. J., and Matsushima, K. Overexpression of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase promotes the survival of tumor cells exposed to interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, selected anticancer drugs, and ionizing radiation.

https://openalex.org/W2067961064,"Upon activation, B lymphocytes can change the class of the antibody they express by immunoglobulin class switch recombination. Cytokines can direct this recombination to distinct classes by the specific activation of repetitive recombinogenic DNA sequences, the switch regions. Recombination to a particular switch region (s gamma 1) was abolished in mice that were altered to lack sequences that are 5' to the s gamma 1 region. This result directly implicates the functional importance of 5' switch region flanking sequences in the control of class switch recombination. Mutant mice exhibit a selective agammaglobulinemia and may be useful in the assessment of the biological importance of immunoglobulin G1."
https://openalex.org/W2123750058,"Cell lines from rhabdomyosarcomas, which are tumors of muscle origin, have been used as models of CD4-independent HIV infection. These cell lines can be induced to differentiate in vitro. We report here that the vpr gene of HIV1 is sufficient for the differentiation of the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE671. Differentiated cells are characterized by great enlargement, altered morphology, lack of replication, and high level expression of the muscle-specific protein myosin. We have also observed the morphological differentiation and inhibition of proliferation of two other transformed cell lines. vpr-transfected cells remain fully viable in culture for extended periods. These observations elucidate a potential role for vpr in the virus life cycle and raise the possibility that some aspects of HIV-induced pathologies may be caused by a disturbance of cells by vpr."
https://openalex.org/W1968428725,"Pyruvate oxidase from Lactobacillus plantarum is a tetrameric enzyme that decarboxylates pyruvate, producing hydrogen peroxide and the energy-storage metabolite acetylphosphate. Structure determination at 2.1 angstroms showed that the cofactors thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are bound at the carboxyl termini of six-stranded parallel beta sheets. The pyrophosphate moiety of TPP is bound to a metal ion and to a beta alpha alpha beta unit corresponding to an established sequence fingerprint. The spatial arrangement of TPP and FAD suggests that the oxidation of the oxyethyl intermediate does not occur by hydride displacement but rather by a two-step transfer of two electrons."
https://openalex.org/W2039451581,"In human neutrophils, as in other cell types, Ras-related guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins are directed toward their regulatory targets in membranes by a series of posttranslational modifications that include methyl esterification of a carboxyl-terminal prenylcysteine residue. In intact cells and in a reconstituted in vitro system, the amount of carboxyl methylation of Ras-related proteins increased in response to the chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). Activation of Ras-related proteins by guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) had a similar effect and induced translocation of p22rac2 from cytosol to plasma membrane. Inhibitors of prenylcysteine carboxyl methylation effectively blocked neutrophil responses to FMLP. These findings suggest a direct link between receptor-mediated signal transduction and the carboxyl methylation of Ras-related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2039109795,"The pelle gene is required for the nuclear import of dorsal protein that establishes dorsoventral polarity in Drosophila embryos. We report here the genetic mapping and molecular characterization of pelle. DNA sequence analysis revealed that pelle encodes a protein of 501 amino acids, the last 292 of which comprise a protein kinase catalytic domain. Microinjection of in vitro synthesized transcripts containing site-directed mutations indicates that the kinase catalytic domain is required for biological activity. This domain is most similar to that of the rat and mos protein kinases and is predicted to have a serine and threonine specificity. These results provide direct evidence for the role of phosphorylation in the in vivo regulation of a rel-like transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W1975298116,"Since the inflammatory process develops after transplantation to the brain, we sought to determine the presence of cytokines following a surgical trauma to the brain of an adult mouse. We report the early and marked presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 alpha in neuronal somata of the striatum following a surgical injury to the hippocampus. The expression of cytokines later extends to neuronal cells of the hippocampus, thalamus, cerebral cortex, brain stem, and cerebellum and to glial cells of the corpus callosum. By contrast, these cytokines are not expressed by neuronal cells following injury to other regions, such as the striatum, cerebellum, and cortex. This study suggests a possible role for certain neurons in the brain's early reaction to a penetrating injury."
https://openalex.org/W1972865565,"Founder cells for most early lineages of the sea urchin embryo are probably specified through inductive intercellular interactions. It is shown here that a complete respecification of cell fate occurs when 16-cell stage micromeres from the vegetal pole of a donor embryo are implanted into the animal pole of an intact recipient embryo. Animal pole cells adjacent to the transplanted micromeres are respecified from presumptive ectoderm into vegetal plate founder cells. These induced vegetal plate cells express the entire battery of genes characteristic of the endogenous vegetal plate cells. The ectopic vegetal plate invaginates during gastrulation to form a second archenteron which differentiates properly into a tripartite gut, as shown by the spatial pattern of expression of an endoderm-specific marker gene. Thus, transplanted micromeres can signal neighboring cells to induce them to change their fate."
https://openalex.org/W2054643844,"Synaptotagmin, a major intrinsic membrane protein of synaptic vesicles that binds Ca2+, was purified from bovine brain and immobilized onto Sepharose 4B. Affinity chromatography of brain membrane proteins on immobilized synaptotagmin revealed binding of alpha- and beta-neurexins to synaptotagmin in a Ca(2+)-independent manner. Using a series of recombinant proteins in which glutathione S-transferase was fused to the cytoplasmic domains of three different neurexins or of control proteins, it was found that synaptotagmin specifically interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of neurexins but not of control proteins. This interaction is dependent on a highly conserved, 40 amino acid sequence that makes up most of the cytoplasmic tails of the neurexins. Our data suggest a direct interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of a plasma membrane protein (the neurexins) and a protein specific for a subcellular organelle (synaptotagmin). Such an interaction could have an important role in the docking and targeting of synaptic vesicles in the nerve terminal."
https://openalex.org/W2164941141,"The most common class of activation domains, the so-called acidic activators, has been proposed either to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical structure or to exist as unstructured ""acid blobs."" However, genetic analysis of an acidic activation domain in the yeast GAL4 protein has suggested that the structure of the activation region is a beta sheet. To distinguish between these models, we conducted a biophysical analysis of peptides corresponding to the yeast GAL4 and GCN4 acidic activation domains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy shows that the peptides are not alpha helical, but that they can undergo a transition to a structure that is almost 100% beta sheet in character in slightly acidic solution. We also show that the artificial acidic activator AH has structural properties that are markedly different from the natural GAL4 and GCN4 domains and does not adopt a beta-rich structure at reduced pH."
https://openalex.org/W2013747720,"Regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes relies on intricate protein-protein interactions. Transcription of the galactose genes in yeast has been a productive model for this type of interaction. The positive activator in this system, GAL4, has a bifunctional C-terminus. It contains both a prototypic acidic activation domain and a region that binds the negative regulator, GAL80. We have taken advantage of this colocalization of functions to subject the region to a constrained mutagenesis analysis: one function was maintained, while the other one was altered. This analysis and the experiments it suggested have led us to two conclusions: first, the acidic amino acids are not, as commonly thought, required for activation; second, this region is not unstructured or alpha helical, but its function may require a beta sheet."
https://openalex.org/W1498617433,"Staining of thymus tissue with the plant lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) is a classic technique for defining the cortical (PNA+) and medullary (PNA-) regions of this tissue. These two regions are primarily composed of immature and mature thymocytes, respectively. Conversion of the PNA+ to the PNA- phenotype has been attributed to masking of the cell surface carbohydrate receptors of PNA by sialic acid during the intrathymic maturation of these cells. We present evidence that the regulated expression of a single glycosyltransferase, a Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 2,3-sialyltransferase, can account for this glycosylation change. This enzyme sialylates the preferred ligand of PNA, Gal beta 1,3GalNAc, forming the sequence NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,3GalNAc, thus masking PNA binding sites. Expression of the enzyme is inversely proportional to expression of the PNA receptor, as evidenced by analysis of T-lymphoblastoid cell lines and by in situ hybridization experiments in human thymic tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2038665174,"The secretory granule matrix is a miniature biopolymer that consists of a charged polymer network that traps peptides and transmitters when it condenses and releases them on exocytotic decondensation. Models of exocytotic fusion have treated this matrix as a short circuit and have neglected its electrical contributions. This matrix responded to negative voltages by swelling, which was accompanied by a large increase in conductance, and to positive voltages by condensing. Thus, the matrix resembled a diode. The swollen matrix exerted large pressures on the order of 12 bar. The responses took place within milliseconds of the application of the electric field. These findings suggest that matrix decondensation, and therefore product release, is controlled by potential gradients."
https://openalex.org/W1972877871,"Biomolecular membranes display rich statistical mechanical behavior. They are classified as liquid in the absence of shear elasticity in the plane of the membrane and tethered (solid) when the neighboring molecules or subunits are connected and the membranes exhibit solid-like elastic behavior in the plane of the membrane. The spectrin skeleton of red blood cells was studied as a model tethered membrane. The static structure factor of the skeletons, measured by small-angle x-ray and light scattering, was fitted with a structure factor predicted with a model calculation. The model describes tethered membrane sheets with free edges in a flat phase, which is a locally rough but globally flat membrane configuration. The fit was good for large scattering vectors. The membrane roughness exponent, zeta, defined through h alpha L zeta, where h is the average amplitude of out-of-plane fluctuations and L is the linear membrane dimension, was determined to be 0.65 +/- 0.10. Computer simulations of model red blood cell skeletons also showed this flat phase. The value for the roughness exponent, which was determined from the scaling properties of membranes of different sizes, was consistent with that from the experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2072328369,"Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are present in the blood of some marine fishes and inhibit the growth of ice crystals at subzero temperatures by adsorption to the ice lattice. The solution structure of a Type III AFP was determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These measurements indicate that this 66-residue protein has an unusual fold in which eight beta strands form two sheets of three antiparallel strands and one sheet of two antiparallel strands, and the triple-stranded sheets are packed orthogonally into a beta sandwich. This structure is completely different from the amphipathic, helical structure observed for Type I AFPs."
https://openalex.org/W2059938663,The squid giant synapse was used to test the hypothesis that guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins regulate the local distribution of synaptic vesicles within nerve terminals. Presynaptic injection of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS irreversibly inhibited neurotransmitter release without changing either the size of the calcium signals produced by presynaptic action potentials or the number of synaptic vesicles docked at presynaptic active zones. Neurotransmitter release was also inhibited by injection of the nonhydrolyzable guanosine diphosphate (GDP) analog GDPβS but not by injection of AIF4-. These results suggest that a small molecular weight GTP-binding protein directs the docking of synaptic vesicles that occurs before calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release. Depletion of undocked synaptic vesicles by GTPγS indicates that additional GTP-binding proteins function in the terminal at other steps responsible for synaptic vesicle replenishment.

https://openalex.org/W1529326564,"Nitric oxide has been implicated as the effector molecule that mediates interlcukin-1β (IL-1β)-in-duced inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by rat islets. Brief exposures of islets (1 h) to IL-1β have been shown to inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion at 8 or 18 h after removal of this cytokine. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if brief exposures of islets to IL-1β are sufficient to induce the formation of nitric oxide and to examine the signaling process associated with IL-1β-induced expression of nitric oxide synthase. We demonstrate that a 1-h pretreatment of islets with IL-1β followed by an 8-h incubation in the absence of this cytokine results in inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (50%), which is completely prevented by pretreatment of islets with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA). The production of nitric oxide by islets under these pulse conditions is demonstrated by IL-1β-induced nitrite and electron paramagnetic resonance-detectable iron-nitrosyl complex formation, both of which are prevented by NMMA. IL-1β initiates a signal transduction process resulting in the expression of nitric oxide synthase. The signaling process appears to require the activation of a tyrosine kinase, since the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein prevents both IL-1β-induced inhibition of insulin secretion by islets and formation of nitric oxide by the insulinoma cell line RINm5F. These results show that short exposures of islets to IL-1β are sufficient to induce the formation of nitric oxide resulting in inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and that a tyrosine kinase may participate in the early signaling events required for IL-1β to induce the expression of nitric oxide synthase.— Corbett, J. A.; Sweetland, M. A.; Lancaster, J. R., Jr.; McDaniel, M. L.

https://openalex.org/W1964726593,"We have used IacZ reporter gene constructs to study the promoter/enhancer regions of the Drosophila FMRFamide neuropeptide gene in germ line transformants. FMRFamide is normally expressed ∼60 diverse neurons of the larval CNS that represent ∼15 distinct cell types. An 8 kb FMRFamide DNA fragment (including 5 kb of 5′ upstream sequence) was sufficient to direct a pattern of IacZ expression that mimicked nearly all spatial aspects of the normal pattern. This result indicates that the cell-specific regulation of FMRFamide expression is largely generated by transcriptional mechanisms. Reporter gene expression was lost from selected cell types when smaller fragments were tested, suggesting that multiple control regions are included in the FMRFamide promoter. One region (a 300 by fragment from −476 to −162) acted as an enhancer for 1 of the ∼15 FMRFamide-positive cell types, the OL2 neurons. These results suggest that, in the mature nervous system, the complex pattern of FMRFamide neuropeptide gene expression derives from the activity of discrete, cell type-specific enhancers that are independently regulated."

https://openalex.org/W1738677520,"Laminins are trimeric glycoproteins composed of A, B1, and B2 chains that play important roles in cell adhesion and differentiation and in the assembly of basement membranes. There is evidence that multiple independent gene products can be used to supply the A, B1, and B2-like chains, thereby generating diverse laminin molecules. The set of A chain-like polypeptides are the most divergent. The amino-terminal portion of each chain, called the short arm, is composed of alternating cysteine-rich and globular domains. The amino-terminal two-thirds of the newly characterized Drosophila laminin A chain appears to encode a novel structure, but the analysis presented here shows that substantial portions of its amino acid sequence are related to sequences found in other A, B1, and B2 chains. A portion of the Drosophila A chain is composed of sequences like those found in B2 chains. These sequences parallel a portion of the vertebrate A chains, suggesting a structure for a shared ancestral A chain. However, unlike vertebrate A chains, the Drosophila A chain also contains sequences typical of B1 chains, suggesting that its gene must have arisen by recombination of segments from different primordial laminin genes.— MacKrell, A. J.; Kusche-Gullberg, M.; Garrison, K.; Fessler, J. H. Novel Drosophilia laminin A chain reveals structural relationships between laminin subunits. FASEB J. 7: 375-381; 1993."
