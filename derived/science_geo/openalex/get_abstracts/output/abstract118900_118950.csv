https://openalex.org/W1995379683,"Transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB have been implicated in the inducible expression of a variety of genes in response to oxidative stress. Recently, based on the observation that butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) induce AP-1 binding activity and AP-1-dependent gene expression and assuming that these compounds exert an antioxidant effect, it was claimed that AP-1 is an antioxidant-responsive factor. To determine whether AP-1 can be responsive to both oxidant and antioxidant, we examined the nature of BHA and PDTC inducing activity. Using EPR spectroscopy to detect semiquinone radicals, we demonstrate the autoxidation of BHA metabolite tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) to tert-butylquinone. The kinetics of TBHQ-mediated generation of ·OH radicals were monitored in intact hepatoma HepG2 cells by EPR spin trapping technique. Exogenous catalase inhibited the rate and amount of ·OH radical formation and the induction of AP-1-mediated glutathione S-transferase (GST) Ya gene expression by BHA and TBHQ, thus indicating the intermediate formation of H2O2 in the metabolism of these chemicals. Furthermore, we show that the induction of AP-1 and NF-κB activities and GST Ya gene expression by BHA and TBHQ is due to a pro-oxidant activity, since this induction was inhibited by thiol compounds N-acetyl cysteine and GSH. Similarly, induction of AP-1 and GST Ya gene expression by PDTC was inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine and GSH. The present findings do not support the notion that the induction of AP-1 by BHA, TBHQ, or PDTC is an antioxidant response and demonstrate that both AP-1 and NF-κB activities are induced by oxygen radicals.

The present findings do not support the notion that the induction of AP-1 by BHA, TBHQ, or PDTC is an antioxidant response and demonstrate that both AP-1 and NF-κB activities are induced by oxygen radicals. Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide anion O2, H2O2, hydroxyl radical ·OH, organic peroxides, and radicals, are generated endogenously by all aerobic cells as byproducts of a number of metabolic reactions (1Fridovich I. Science. 1978; 201: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress, which is an excess production of reactive oxygen species, can damage cells by lipid peroxidation and alteration of protein and nucleic acid structure. To prevent oxidative damage and allow survival in an oxygen environment, mammalian cells have developed an elaborate antioxidant defense system that includes nonenzymatic antioxidants (e.g. glutathione and vitamins C and E) as well as enzymatic activities such as superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase, and other hemoprotein peroxidases (2Sies H. Am. J. Med. 1991; 91: 315-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In addition, drug-metabolizing enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases, glucuronosyl transferases, and NAD(P)H:quinone reductase, by removing compounds capable of generating reactive oxygen species, decrease the level of oxidative stress and are also part of the antioxidant defense (2Sies H. Am. J. Med. 1991; 91: 315-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Recent findings indicate that oxidative stress conditions enhance the expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzyme activities such as glutathione S-transferase (3Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V.

Kugelman A. Iwamoto T. Tian L. Forman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26512-26517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and heme oxygenase (6Lautier D. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species were also shown to be responsible for the inducible expression of genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses (7Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells enhanced production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress conditions are induced by a variety of stimuli, which include ionizing radiation, exposure to drugs and xenobiotics, or binding of cytokines to cell surface receptors (10Cerutti P.A. Science. 1985; 227: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that the different stimuli use reactive oxygen species as signaling messengers to activate transcription factors and induce gene expression. Recently it was shown that the activation of transcription factor NF-κB by different stimuli, such as cytokines TNF 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorBHA3(2)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisoleBHTbutylated hydroxytolueneDDTCdiethyldithiocarbamateDMPO5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyroline N-oxideGSTglutathione S-transferaseNACN-acetyl cysteinePDTCpyrrolidine dithiocarbamateQbc2-phenyl-4-(butylamino)naphthol[2,3-h]-quinoline-7,12-dioneQn2-phenyl-5-nitronaphthol[2,3-g]-indole-6,11-dioneTBHQtert-butylhydroquinoneTBQtert-butylquinoneTEMPO2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-one. and interleukin-1, phorbol ester, cycloheximide, lipopolysaccharide, and in some cell types H2O2, is inhibited by antioxidant compound NAC and metal chelators (7Schreck R.

Based on these observations it was concluded that the activation of NF-κB, which occurs by a posttranslational mechanism involving dissociation of inhibitory protein IκB (13Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar), is controlled by reactive oxygen species and the intracellular redox state. Furthermore, using cell lines stably overexpressing H2O2-degrading enzyme, catalase, or cytoplasmic copper/zinc-dependent superoxide dismutase, which enhances H2O2 production from superoxide, Schmidt et al. (14Schmidt K.N. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Baeuerle P.A. Chem.

Transcription factor AP-1 is an ubiquitous regulatory protein complex that interacts with AP-1 binding sites of target genes to regulate transcription in response to environmental stimuli (15Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3266) Google Scholar). The AP-1 factor is composed of protein products of members of fos and jun proto-oncogene families, which form homodimeric (Jun-Jun) or heterodimeric (Fos-Jun) complexes. The expression of fos and jun genes was shown to be induced by a variety of extracellular stimulatory agents (e.g. serum, growth factors, phorbol esters, calcium ionophore, neurotransmitters, and ionizing radiation) that promote cell proliferation and transformation and neuronal excitation (15Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3266) Google Scholar, 16Morgan J.L. Curran T. Annu. Rev.

A. 1990; 87: 5663-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the induction of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme glutathione S-transferase Ya gene expression by a variety of structurally unrelated chemical agents have indicated the involvement of AP-1 in the cellular response to chemical stress. It was shown that the induction of a mouse glutathione S-transferase (GST) Ya gene expression, is mediated by a regulatory element, EpRE, composed of two adjacent AP-1-like binding sites that binds and is transactivated by the AP-1 complex (19Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 20Friling R.S. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Regulatory elements with similar structure were observed to mediate the inducible expression of several other genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes (21Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of hepatoma cells to chemical inducers of GST Ya gene expression such as β-naphthoflavone, 3-methylcholanthrene, tert-butylhydroquinone, trans-4-phenyl-3-butene-2-one, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, dioxin, phenobarbital, hydrogen peroxide, arsenite, arsenate, and heavy metals was found to induce an increase in AP-1 binding activity (21Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar, 22Puga A. Nebert D.N. Carrier F. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 23Pinkus R.

Structure and Function of Glutathione S-Transferases. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 129-136Google Scholar). The finding that chemical agents of diverse structure all activate GST Ya gene expression through the induction of AP-1 transcription factor that interacts with the EpRE enhancer, led to the assumption that the various chemicals may produce a common transduction signal responsible for AP-1 induction. It was observed that chemical inducers of GST Ya gene expression can generate by metabolism reactive oxygen species or can modify thiol compounds, both of which may cause depletion of reduced GSH and a change of intracellular redox equilibrium toward a more oxidizing environment (25Daniel V. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 173-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Recent studies support the hypothesis that the cellular redox state plays an important role in the induction of AP-1 and AP-1-mediated activation of GST Ya gene expression and indicate that this induction is associated with an increase in intracellular oxidant level (3Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 36-40PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pinkus R. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The role of reactive oxygen species in the induction of AP-1 activity and GST Ya gene expression and their effect on intracellular GSH levels were recently studied by exposing hepatoma cells to quinones with different capacities to generate oxygen radicals (4Pinkus R. Weiner L.M. Daniel V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The findings indicate a correlation between quinone-mediated production of ·OH radicals, a decrease in GSH levels, and the induction of AP-1 binding activity and GST Ya gene expression. In view of the regulatory role played by the AP-1 transcription factor in the inducible expression of GST Ya and other drug-metabolizing enzymes by oxidants and thiol reagents (3Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 36-40PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar), the induction of AP-1 appears to be part of a general mechanism of regulation of gene expression by oxidative stress. Recent studies, however, based on the assumption that the inducible effect of 2(3)tert-butyl-4 hydroxyanisole (BHA) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) on the AP-1 binding activity and AP-1-mediated reporter gene expression is due to their antioxidant activities, have concluded that AP-1 is an antioxidant-responsive factor (26Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 27Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrügger W. Dröge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Thus, AP-1 activity would be induced by antagonistic signals, by both oxidative stress and antioxidants. The answer to this apparently paradoxical situation may be found, in our opinion, in a reconsideration of the chemical and biological features of BHA, its metabolite tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), and PDTC. Phenolic compounds such as BHA and BHT, termed phenolic antioxidants due to their chain-breaking action during autoxidation of lipids, are utilized for food preservation and suppression of lipid peroxidation in biological materials. However, these phenolic antioxidants were found to exhibit also tumor-promoting activity in rodents, an activity that seems to be related to the formation of oxidized metabolites (28Kahl R. Sies H. Oxidative Stress: Oxidants and Antioxidants. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1991: 245Google Scholar). Indeed, BHA is oxidatively demethylated in mammalian tissues to TBHQ, which by autoxidation to tert-butylquinone (TBQ) may produce reactive oxygen species by redox cycling (29Kahl R. Weinke S. Kappus H. Toxicology. 1989; 59: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, BHA may have the potential to act both as oxidant and antioxidant. This raises the question of which of the two activities is involved in the induction of AP-1-mediated gene expression. In the present study we investigated whether the induction of AP-1 activity and GST Ya gene expression by BHA and its metabolite TBHQ is due to generation of reactive oxygen species or to an antioxidant activity. The formation of semiquinone by auto-oxidation of TBHQ both in vitro and in intact cells was detected by EPR spectroscopy. The generation of ·OH radicals by TBHQ metabolism was monitored by DMPO-·OH spin trapping and EPR spectra measurements. In this report we present evidence that the induction of AP-1 and NF-κB activities and GST Ya gene expression by phenolic antioxidants BHA and TBHQ is due to oxidation and quinone-mediated generation of oxygen radicals. Adriamycin hydrochloride, 5′,5′-dimethyl-1-pyroline N-oxide (DMPO), N-acetylcysteine, reduced glutathione, dimethyl sulfoxide, 3(2)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and bovine liver catalase (1540 units/mg) were obtained from Sigma; 2,2,6,6,tetra-methylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-one (TEMPO) and tert-butylhydroquinone were from Aldrich. Quinones 2-phenyl-4-(butylamino)naphthol[2,3-h]quinoline-7,12-dione (Qbc) and 2-phenyl-5-nitronaphthol[2,3-g]indole-6,11-dione (Qn) and S-S nitroxide biradical were synthesized by Dikalov et al. (30Dikalov S.I. Rumyantseva G.V. Piskunov A.V. Weiner L.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8947-8953Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Khramtsov et al. (31Khramtsov V.V. Yelinova V.I. Weiner L.M. Berezina T.A. Martin V.V. Volodarsky L.B. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), respectively. Human HepG2 and rat H4II (a differentiated cell line that still expresses GST Ya gene) hepatoma cells were grown in F12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) with 10% fetal calf serum (32Daniel V. Sharon R. Bensimon A. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HepG2 and H4II cells have been previously found to yield similar results concerning AP-1 binding of nuclear extracts, transient expression of GST Ya gene constructs, intracellular measurements of GSH levels, and quinone-mediated generation of ·OH radicals (3Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 36-40PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pinkus R. Weiner L.M. Daniel V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar). The EpRE Ya-cat plasmid construct, containing the EpRE 41-base pair enhancer of GST Ya gene ligated into the −187 site of its promoter driving the expression of CAT gene (32Daniel V. Sharon R. Bensimon A. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was transfected for transient expression into HepG2 cells as described (3Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 36-40PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were grown on 100-mm plates and, after exposure to chemicals, nuclear extracts were prepared (33Schreiber E. Matthias P. Mueller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acid Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar) and assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay for 32P-labeled AP-1 or NFκB oligonucleotide binding (21Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides 5′-GATCAA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTCCGCTGAGGC-3′ containing the AP-1 and NF-κB binding sites, respectively, were prepared by O. Goldberg (Weizmann Institute). Total cellular RNA was prepared by the guanidium thiocyanate extraction method (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63167) Google Scholar) and was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose filters. The RNA blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled probes for GST Ya cDNA and rRNA. Total -SH groups were measured in intact HepG2 cells by the EPR spectroscopy method of Weiner (35Weiner L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as described previously by Pinkus et al. (4Pinkus R. Weiner L.M. Daniel V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and in cell extracts by optical methods, as described by Bergelson et al. (3Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 36-40PubMed Google Scholar), using the Ellman reagent (36Boyne A.F. Ellman G. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 46: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and by the Griffith (37Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4027) Google Scholar) procedure. HepG2 cells grown to log phase were harvested by scraping, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), and suspended in the same buffer at a density of 1 × 105 to 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. ·OH radical formation was followed by EPR of spin adduct DMPO-·OH (38Buettner G.R. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A typical 200-µl incubation mixture for trapping ·OH radicals contained 2.5 × 105 cells, 100 mM DMPO, and 2 µM to 1 mM TBHQ dissolved in Me2SO. For DMPO-·OH radical measurements the Me2SO final concentrations were not higher than 0.005% and were obtained by serial dilutions with phosphate-buffered saline of 1 M TBHQ solution in 50% Me2SO. The DMPO in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) was purified before use by passing it twice through a syringe containing activated charcoal. The EPR spectra of DMPO-·OH, semiquinone, and TEMPO radicals were recorded in a Brucker electron spin resonance ER200D-SRC spectrometer in a quartz capillary of 150 µl. The standard instrumental parameters were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.7 GHz; incident microwave power, 10 mW; center of the field, 3480; scan range, 100 G; field modulation, 1 G; receiver gain, 6.3 × 105; and time constant, 640 ms. The EPR spectrum of DMPO-·OH consisted of a quartet (1:2:2:1) with hyperfine splitting constants of aN=aH = 14.9 G. The amplitude of the second peak in the quartet of the EPR spectrum of DMPO-·OH (Fig. 1b) was used for further calculations. The EPR spectrum of TEMPO consisted of a triplet (1:1:1) with hyperfine splitting constants of aN = 14.9 G. For computer simulation of EPR spectra the Public EPR Software Distribution developed by D. R. Duling (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health) was used. In order to quantitate the TBHQ-mediated formation of ·OH radical in cultured cells, we have used the spin trapping of ·OH by DMPO and measured the EPR spectrum of the resulting DMPO-·OH spin adduct. Fig. 1b shows that incubation of intact HepG2 cells with 2 µM TBHQ in the presence of 100 mM DMPO for 15 min before the EPR spectrum was measured, resulted in the formation of an EPR spectrum consisting of a quartet (1:2:2:1) with hyperfine splitting of 14.9 G, which is characteristic for the DMPO-·OH spin adduct (39Buettner G.R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1987; 3: 259-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). An EPR spectrum consisting of six components was observed to be equally produced during incubation of 10 mM TBHQ in phosphate-buffered saline in the presence or absence of HepG2 cells (Fig. 1, c and d). Similar sextet spectra were registered during incubation of TBHQ in phosphate-buffered saline by Schilderman et al. (40Schilderman P.A.E.L. van Maanen J.M.S. Smeets E.J. ten Hoor F. Kleinjans J.C.S. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, using a flat cell and varying the conditions of spectra registration of 10 mM TBHQ solution and the scan range to 25 G we obtained a well resolved EPR spectrum consisting of eight lines of equal intensity (Fig. 1e). This spectrum corresponds to the known EPR spectrum of the semiquinone of TBHQ (41Pedersen J.A. Pedersen J.A. CRC Handbook of EPR Spectra from Quinones and Quinols. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 69Google Scholar). Computer simulation of the experimental spectrum (Fig. 1f) yielded the hyperfine splitting constants a2 = 0.08 G, a3 = 1.65 G, a5 = 2.13 G and a6 = 2.82 G, which are close to those estimated for the semiquinone of TBHQ in aqueous solution by Asworth (42Asworth P. Mol. Phys. 1975; 30: 313-317Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the EPR sextet spectra observed in Fig. 1 (c and d), which were ascribed by others to the semiquinone of TBHQ (40Schilderman P.A.E.L. van Maanen J.M.S. Smeets E.J. ten Hoor F. Kleinjans J.C.S. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) are actually the result of inadequate experimental conditions for ESR spectra registration. The kinetics of ·OH formation in TBHQ-treated cells were studied by measuring the amplitude of the EPR signal of DMPO-·OH spin adduct (Fig. 1b) produced by exposure for different time periods to TBHQ concentrations from 2 µM to 1 mM. The results presented in Fig. 2 indicate that for each TBHQ concentration used there is an increase in the amount of DMPO-·OH production as a function of time of incubation. However, both the kinetics of ·OH radical formation and the maximum amplitude of the spin adduct EPR signal are found to decrease with the increase in TBHQ concentration being almost abolished at 1 mM. BHA, under conditions similar to those described for TBHQ in Fig. 2, did not produce any DMPO-·OH spin adduct signal (data not shown). We should observe that in order to prevent Me2SO interference and formation of DMPO-·CH3 radical spin adduct, all EPR measurements of the DMPO-·OH signal were carried out in the presence of Me2SO concentrations up to 0.005%. To study the involvement of H2O2 in ·OH formation by TBHQ and adriamycin, a quinone producer of ·OH radical previously studied by us (4Pinkus R. Weiner L.M. Daniel V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we have measured the effect of catalase on the kinetics of DMPO-·OH spin adduct formation by these chemicals. Fig. 3 shows that the addition of catalase to an incubation mixture of intact HepG2 cells containing 2 µM TBHQ or 100 µM adriamycin and 100 mM DMPO-·OH reduces both the kinetics and the maximal amplitude of the DMPO-·OH signal. The effect seems to depend on catalase concentration. Moreover, the addition of catalase (0.1 or 1.0 mg/ml) after the DMPO-·OH production reached steady-state levels is found to cause an immediate drop in DMPO-·OH concentrations followed by a continued decrease with kinetics dependent upon catalase concentrations (Fig. 3). Assuming that the decrease in ·OH radical production with the increase in TBHQ concentration observed in Fig. 2 may be due to an antioxidant effect of this chemical, we have studied the effect of TBHQ addition to an active ·OH radical producer such as adriamycin. Fig. 4A indicates that the addition of 1 mM TBHQ to HepG2 cells incubated with 100 µM adriamycin and 100 mM DMPO at the point where DMPO-·OH spin adduct formation has reached steady state levels causes an immediate drop in DMPO-·OH level. An inhibition of DMPO-·OH formation is observed in cells preincubated for 30 min with 1 mM TBHQ before the addition of adriamycin. Suspecting that TBHQ may inhibit DMPO-·OH spin adduct signal by reducing the DMPO-·OH spin adduct to diamagnetic hydroxylamine, we have studied the effect of TBHQ on a stable nitroxyl radical such as TEMPO. Aliquots of 100 µM TEMPO were incubated with increasing concentrations of TBHQ from 1 µM to 70 mM, and the TEMPO radical signal was measured from the amplitude of the middle component of the triplet in EPR spectrum. The results presented in Fig. 4B show a decrease in TEMPO radical signal as a function of TBHQ concentration, which indicates a direct reduction of the nitroxyl radical and production of EPR silent hydroxylamine. The intracellular -SH levels were measured in intact HepG2 cells exposed to TBHQ by the EPR spectroscopy method of Weiner (35Weiner L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and in cell extracts by optical methods using Ellman reagent as described previously (3Bergelson S. Pinkus R. Daniel V.

It was observed that 3-h exposure of cells to 100 µM TBHQ caused a decrease in total -SH levels of about 18% as measured by the different methods (Table I).Table I.Intracellular GSH levels in HepG2 cells following a 3-h treatment with 100 µM TBHQEPR methodGSH levels (nmol/106 cells)Optical methodsEllman (36Boyne A.F.

To determine whether this induction is the result of its antioxidant properties or is due to its oxidation to semiquinone/quinone and production of ·OH radicals by redox cycling, HepG2 cells were exposed for 3 h to 30 µM TBHQ in the absence of, or after a 60-min preincubation with, antioxidant NAC or GSH. Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay for AP-1 binding activity using an AP-1 binding site oligonucleotide probe.

https://openalex.org/W2037134815,"A method was developed for obtaining a homogeneous silkworm hemolymph protein (peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP) which has affinity for peptidoglycan and the ability to trigger the prophenoloxidase cascade upon its binding to peptidoglycan. The purified PGRP had a molecular mass of about 19 kDa and is composed of a single polypeptide with an isoelectric point of 6.5. It bound to peptidoglycan in the absence of divalent cation, whereas its binding to β1,3-glucan and chitin was not detected. N-Acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-(β1-4)-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine did not inhibit purified PGRP to bind insoluble peptidoglycan, but fragmented soluble peptidoglycan did. PGRP seemed to require peptidoglycan as a possible ligand to keep its glycan portion consisting of at least two or more of the repeating unit. PGRP did not have any detectable lysozyme activity, and its amino acid composition and amino-terminal sequence of 20 amino acid residues were shown to be different from those of silkworm lysozyme. PGRP seems to be a hitherto unknown protein. In the absence of PGRP, the prophenoloxidase cascade in the plasma fraction of hemolymph could not be triggered by peptidoglycan, indicating that some type of activity, capable of activating the cascade, is generated upon their binding. However, the exact nature of this activity is not yet known. The purified PGRP bound to peptidoglycan did not hydrolyze significantly any of the 26 commercially available peptidyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarins, substrates for various proteases.

Insects have effective defense mechanisms against microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The major defense mechanisms in the hemocoel are either cellular (phagocytosis, hemocyte aggregation (nodule formation) and formation of multicellular hemocytic capsules (encapsulation)) (1Lackie A.M. Adv. Insect Physiol. 1988; 21: 85-178Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar) or humoral effected by immune proteins, lectins, and the prophenoloxidase cascade (2Boman H.G. Faye I. Gudmundsson G.H.

Recognition of microorganisms as non-self is apparently involved when the insect defense mechanisms are set in motion. As stated by Janeway (7Janeway Jr., C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), clonally selected recognition molecules like immunogloblins in higher vertebrates have not evolved in insects, but molecules for nonclonal pattern recognition play a central role in discrimination of self from non-self. Thus, a number of molecules with affinity to particular structures of bacterial or fungal cell walls have been reported from insect hemolymph and they are thought to be potential recognition molecules for foreignness. It is reasonable that recognition molecules for foreignness have to be expressed constitutively and to be present in the plasma or cell surface before invasion by foreign objects. Hemolin (8Sun S.-C.

Chem. 1991; 266: 13318-13323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and peptidoglycan (18Yoshida H. Ochiai M. Ashida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have been suggested as recognition molecules. However, the biological activities of these proteins are far from being fully understood. Proteins with affinity to β1,3-glucan and peptidoglycan were originally discovered in the course of studies on prophenoloxidase cascade. The prophenoloxidase cascade is present in insect and crustacean hemolymph (5Ashida M. Yamazaki H.I. Ohnishi E. Ishizaki H. Molting and Metamorphosis. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo/Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 239Google Scholar, 6Johansson M.W. Söderhäll K. Parasitol. Today. 1989; 5: 171-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Very recently the chitinous cuticle of the insect exoskeleton was also found to contain a prophenoloxidase cascade (19Ashida M. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10698-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The hemolymph prophenoloxidase cascade consists of prophenoloxidase, serine protease zymogens, and proteins with specific affinity to bacterial or fungal cell wall components. It is activated by various non-self materials naturally or artificially introduced into the hemocoel. Under the conditions where the cascade is triggered, increased phagocytosis and hemocyte movement have been observed (20Ratcliffe N.A. Leonard C. Rowley A.F. Science. 1984; 226: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 21Takle G.B. Lackie A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 85: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar). After activation, phenol oxidase catalyzes melanin synthesis from phenolic substances. Melanization is thought to facilitate sequestration of pathogens in nodules or multicellular capsules (22Vey A Götz P. Gupta A.P. Hemocytic and Humoral Immunity in Arthropods. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986: 89Google Scholar), and more recently it has been speculated that intermediate compounds (quinones) in melanin synthesis from mono- or diphenols are highly toxic to living cells including infectious microorganisms (23Nappi A.J. Vass E. Pigment Cell Res. 1993; 6: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, the prophenoloxidase cascade is considered an integral part of insect defense mechanisms. Previously we predicted the presence of two kinds of hemolymph molecules which have specific affinity for peptidoglycan (a bacterial cell wall component) and β1,3-glucan (a fungal cell wall component), respectively (18Yoshida H. Ochiai M. Ashida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both molecules have been supposed to have ability to trigger prophenoloxidase cascade upon binding to their respective ligands. We proposed to name them β1,3-glucan recognition protein (βGRP) 1The abbreviations used are: βGRPβ1,3-glucan recognition proteinPGRPpeptidoglycan recognition proteinGMDPN-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-(β1-4)-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamineMDPN-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminepeptidyl-NH-Mecpeptidyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIEFisoelectric focusingHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidPipespiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). and peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) (14Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The postulated βGRP has been isolated from silkworm, cockroach, and crayfish (14Ochiai M. Ashida M. J.

Peptidoglycan has been shown to have various biological functions both in mammals (25Kotani S. Tsujimoto M. Koga T. Nagao S. Tanaka A. Kawata S. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 2534-2540PubMed Google Scholar) and insects (26Dunn P.E. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1986; 31: 321-339Crossref Google Scholar). Specific binding proteins or receptors have been reported from mammals (27Silverman D.H.S. Krueger J.M. Karnovsky M.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2195-2201PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dziarski R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2100-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but such molecules have not been isolated from invertebrates. Previously, a plasma fraction of silkworm hemolymph, which had been passed through Sepharose 4B coupled to peptidoglycan in the absence of divalent cation, was shown to have all prophenoloxidase cascade components except for the putative PGRP. This plasma fraction (referred to as plasma-PG) was proposed to be used for assaying PGRP in the course of its purification (18Yoshida H. Ochiai M. Ashida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We now describe a method for assaying PGRP by using plasma-PG and a procedure for obtaining homogeneous PGRP, as well as preliminary characterization of the molecule. Silkworm (Bombyx mori) larvae were reared on an artificial diet as described (30Yoshida H. Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 539-545Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Peptidoglycan was prepared from Micrococcus luteus cell walls according to the method of Araki et al. (31Araki Y. Nakatani T. Nakayama K. Ito E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6312-6322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of soluble fragmented peptidoglycan, peptidoglycan was digested with egg white lysozyme (chicken) and fractionated by chromatography on a Sephadex G-50 SF column as described (18Yoshida H. Ochiai M. Ashida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fractions (numbers 57 to 81) obtained in the chromatography were pooled and lyophilized. The lyophilized powder was dissolved in a small volume of distilled water and centrifuged at 89,000 × g for 30 min to remove flocculent materials and the supernatant was again lyophilized. The lyophilized powder thus obtained was dissolved in 10 mM Tris maleate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl (T-M buffer) at a concentration of 2 mg/ml and used as a soluble fragmented peptidoglycan preparation. The plasma fraction of hemolymph was prepared as described previously (30Yoshida H. Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 539-545Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1981; 11: 57-65Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The plasma fraction was passed through a peptidoglycan-Sepharose 4B column in the presence of EDTA according to Yoshida et al. (18Yoshida H. Ochiai M. Ashida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The effluent was named plasma-PG and used for assaying PGRP. The prophenoloxidase cascade in plasma-PG was triggered with β1,3-glucan but not with peptidoglycan (18Yoshida H. Ochiai M. Ashida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which indicates that PGRP had been removed. The sample to be assayed for PGRP was serially diluted, and 10 µl of each dilution was added to a mixture of 5 µl of 80 mM CaCl2, 50 µl of plasma-PG, and 5 µl of peptidoglycan (1 mg of peptidoglycan/ml distilled deionized water, prepared after Yoshida et al. (18Yoshida H. Ochiai M. Ashida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)), followed by incubation at 25°C for 120 min. At the end of the incubation, phenol oxidase activity of the reaction mixture was assayed spectrophotometrically (30Yoshida H. Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 539-545Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that the observed activation of prophenoloxidase was independent of peptidoglycan action, phenol oxidase activity of the reaction mixture devoid of peptidoglycan was always checked after incubation. The greatest dilution of PGRP giving more than 30 units of phenol oxidase activity in the reaction mixture during the incubation period of 120 min was determined, and the reciprocal of the dilution factor used as a tentative measure for quantifying the amount of PGRP. The reciprocal is expressed as the number of units of PGRP activity/ml of sample solution in the present study. Silkworm larvae on the 5th or 6th day of the fifth instar were bled by cutting abdominal legs with scissors. Hemolymph was immediately mixed with saturated ammonium sulfate, pH 6.5, under vigorous stirring. Two hundred-fifty ml of hemolymph from about 400 larvae was collected into 440 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate and stored at 4°C until use. All subsequent procedures were performed at 0-4°C and centrifugation was carried out at 12,000 × g for 20 min unless otherwise specified. The preparation was centrifuged and the precipitate was suspended in 390 ml of 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM phenylthiourea, and 1% ethanol. The suspension was stirred for 2 h, followed by centrifugation at 4,800 × g for 20 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant (69 g/500 ml of the supernatant) and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. Precipitated material was then collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 100 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing additives as above. The solution was dialyzed for 30 h against the same buffer (1.9 liter) followed by dialysis against two changes of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The dialyzed solution was applied at a flow rate of 20 ml/h to a peptidoglycan-Sepharose 4B column (5 × 2.5-cm inner diameter) according to the method of Yoshida et al. (18Yoshida H. Ochiai M. Ashida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) except that lysozyme-digested peptidoglycan was used without fractionation by column chromatography on Sephadex G-50. The column was then sequentially eluted at 20 ml/h with the following eluants: 50 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5; a linear gradient of KCl from 0 to 2 M in a total volume of 120 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5; 60 ml of 5 mM MES, pH 5.5, containing 2 M KCl. The final elution was carried out with 150 ml of 5 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 2 M KCl at a flow rate 220 ml/h. Thirty-ml fractions were collected in containers containing 1.2 ml of 0.5 M Pipes, pH 7.0. All of the fractions were dialyzed separately against 3 liters of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, for 18 h with a change of buffer. The following column chromatography was performed at room temperature on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (FPLC; Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.). The active fractions (numbers 8-12 in Table I) obtained in the previous step were applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min to a hydroxyapatite column (100 × 7.8-mm inner diameter; Koken Ltd., Tokyo) for high pressure liquid chromatography, previously equilibrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, followed by washing the column with 10 ml of the same buffer. The adsorbed proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with two consecutive linear gradients of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, from 10 to 144 mM and from 144 to 1 M with concentration incremental rates of 2.48 and 93 mM/min, respectively. Fraction volume was 1.5 ml. Fractions eluted between 190 and 198 min from the beginning of the application of phosphate gradient were pooled (Fig. 1) and dialyzed overnight against 2 liter of 10 mM triethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 7.5.Table I.PGRP activity in fractions from column chromatography on peptidoglycan-Sepharose 4BFraction numberaFraction numbers 1-7 were obtained by salt gradient elution, fraction numbers 8 and 9 by elution with pH 5.5 buffer, and fraction numbers 10-14 by elution with pH 4.5 buffer.VolumeActivityA280mlunits/ml11600.07321600.10631600.22241600.12051610.33061610.15072410.16683010.04793020.028103030.031113040.040123010.020133000.012143000.011a Fraction numbers 1-7 were obtained by salt gradient elution, fraction numbers 8 and 9 by elution with pH 5.5 buffer, and fraction numbers 10-14 by elution with pH 4.5 buffer. Open table in a new tab The dialyzed fractions were applied to a Mono Q column (HR 5/5) (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.), equilibrated with the same buffer as that used for dialysis. Adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient in the same buffer (Fig. 2). The flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min and 1.5-ml fractions were collected. The fraction with the highest PGRP activity (Fig. 2) was used as the PGRP preparation for study. For the amino acid sequence analyses, the purified PGRP was passed through a reversed phase cyanopropyl-derived silica high performance liquid chromatography column (4.6 mm inner diameter × 250 mm, pore size = 300 Å) as follows: 0.5 ml of PGRP solution (about 40 µg of protein/ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 M NaCl) was applied to the column which was then eluted with a gradient of CH3CN from 30 to 70% in 0.1% CF3COOH/H2O at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. It took 50 min to finish the gradient. The only protein peak appeared at 29.69 min from the beginning of the gradient elution. Protein contained in the peak was pooled and lyophilized. Lysozyme activity was assayed by measuring turbidity of Micrococcus lysodeikticus (Seikagaku Kogyo Ltd., Tokyo) suspension according to the manufacturer's instruction manual. The supernatant at 65% saturation of the ammonium sulfate fractionation of silkworm hemolymph during the first step of PGRP purification was dialyzed against 2.5 liters of 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, for 40 h with three changes of the buffer. The dialyzed solution was applied to a CM-cellulose column (180 × 21-mm inner diameter) equilibrated with the same buffer at a flow rate of 100 ml/h. Adsorbed proteins were eluted at a flow rate 10 ml/h with a linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 M KCl in 200 ml of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Active fractions eluted at about 0.5 M KCl were pooled and dialyzed against 3 liters of 3 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, for 24 h with a change of the buffer, followed by chromatography on hydroxyapatite column (100 × 7.8-mm inner diameter; Koken Ltd., Tokyo) in the fast protein liquid chromatography. A gradient with an incremental rate of phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, concentration, 1 mM/min was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min to the column. A major peak eluted at 0.28 M was used as purified silkworm lysozyme. The molecular weight of native PGRP was estimated with two methods. The PGRP (A280 nm = 0.5) in 40 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.2 M NaCl was subjected to sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation which was conducted by the method of Yphantis (33Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) using a Hitachi analytical ultracentrifuge (Model 282 equipped with a Hitachi ultracentrifuge processor (Model-7). The native PGRP (15 µg) was chromatographed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min on Superose 12 column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl. Egg white ovalbumin (chicken, 45 kDa), myoglobin (horse skeletal muscle, 17 kDa), and cytochrome c (horse heart, 12.4 kDa) were used as proteins for molecular mass standard. Two-hundred µl of each standard protein solution containing 200 µg of protein was subjected to chromatography on the Superose 12 column under the same conditions as PGRP. A plot of their retention times against logarithms of their molecular masses gave a straight line. The molecular mass corresponding to the retention time of PGRP was read from the line. SDS-PAGE was carried out in a 1-mm thick slab gel according to Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), with 12% acrylamide in the separation gel. IEF-PAGE was performed according to the method of Wrigley (35Wrigley C.W. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 559-564Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Gel containing 5% acrylamide, 0.25% bis-acrylamide, and 2% Ampholine pH 3.5-10, was prepared in a column (110 × 2.5-mm inner diameter). After 4 µg of PGRP had been electrofocused for 3 h at 200 V, the gel was treated with 12% trichloroacetic acid and then stained for protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The gel was calibrated with the following isoelectric point markers: amyloglucosidase (pI 3.50), glucose oxidase (pI 4.15), soybean trypsin inhibitor (pI 4.55), β-lactoglobulin A (pI 5.20), bovine carbonic anhydrase B (pI 5.85), human carbonic anhydrase B (pI 6.55), horse myoglobin (pI 6.85 and pI 7.35), lentil lectin (pI 8.15, pI 8.45, and pI 8.65), trypsinogen (pI 9.30). One mg of peptidoglycan was dispersed in 1 ml of T-M buffer and washed with 1 ml of this buffer by four cycles of sedimentation and suspension by centrifugation at 12,600 × g for 5 min. The sedimented peptidoglycan was suspended in 0.5 ml of T-M buffer. Forty-µl of purified PGRP (73 µg of protein/ml of 10 mM triethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.04 M NaCl) was mixed with 120 µl of T-M buffer and 160 µl of the peptidoglycan suspension, and incubated at 4°C for 30 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,600 × g for 5 min. The sedimented peptidoglycan was washed with 300 µl of T-M buffer as above except that sedimented peptidoglycan was transferred to a new vessel before the final washing. The washed peptidoglycan was extracted with 80 µl of solubilizing solution (0.0625 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 19% glycerol, and 5%β-mercaptoethanol). The supernatant (20 µl) of the mixture of PGRP and peptidoglycan suspension and extract (20 µl) of the sedimented peptidoglycan were subjected to SDS-PAGE together with a known amount of purified PGRP. Binding of purified PGRP to chitin (colloidal) and β1,3-glucan (insoluble beads of β1,3-glucan) was examined as above except that peptidoglycan was replaced with chitin and β1,3-glucan, respectively. To investigate the effect of N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-(β1-4)-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (GMDP), N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP), N-acetylmuramic acid, N-acetylglucosamine, and soluble fragmented peptidoglycan on ability of purified PGRP to bind to peptidoglycan was individually examined as above except that purified PGRP was preincubated for 30 min at 4°C with the compounds at 2.19 mM and the soluble fragmented peptidoglycan at 1.55 mg/ml for 30 min at 4° C in T-M buffer. The preincubated PGRP was then examined for its ability to bind to peptidoglycan as above, except that all procedures until the end of washing of peptidoglycan were performed in the presence of the constituents at 1.41 mM and soluble fragmented peptidoglycan at 1 mg/ml. A plasma fraction (0-50 fraction) was prepared from hemolymph of silkworm larvae as described (36Ashida M. Sasaki T. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 1037-1041Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The 0-50 fraction did not contain lysozyme activity which is known to be detected in silkworm hemolymph. One hundred-forty µl of 0-50 fraction (7.41 mg of protein/ml) was treated with 160 µl of peptidoglycan suspension in the presence of 1 mM of (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride. The mixture was then centrifuged and the sedimented peptidoglycan was washed with T-M buffer followed by extraction of proteins with 80 µl of solubilizing solution as described in the preceding section. The extract (20 µl) was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The reactivity was examined (37Kijimoto-Ochiai S. Katagiri Y.U. Ochiai H. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) using peroxidase-conjugated lectins. Briefly, purified PGRP (1.5 µg of protein) was run on SDS-PAGE as described above and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes which were subsequently blotted with peroxidase-conjugated lectins (concanavalin A, Lentil seed agglutinin A, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, Phaeaseolus vulgalis agglutinin E4, Arachis hypogaea agglutinin, Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1, and wheat germ agglutinin). The blots were visualized by incubation with 4-chloronaphtol and H2O2. PGRP preparation purified on cyanopropyl-derived silica HPLC column was analyzed for its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence by automated Edman degradation with a protein sequencer (model 477A, Applied Biosystems) (38Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence was verified by analyzing about 300 pmol of the PGRP 4 times. Amidase activity of PGRP, free or bound to peptidoglycan, was assayed using fluorogenic substrates, peptidyl-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarins (peptidyl-NH-Mec). Preincubation mixtures, comprising 5 volumes of PGRP solution (0.3 mg of protein/ml in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 150 mM NaCl) and 1 volume of peptidoglycan suspension (0.1 mg/ml distilled deionized water) or 5 volumes of the PGRP solution and 1 volume of distilled deionized water, were incubated at 25°C. After 10 min incubation, 10-µl samples of the preincubation mixtures were assayed for amidase activity. The reaction mixture for the assay consisted of 480 µl of T-M buffer containing 5 mM CaCl2, 10 µl of 5 mM fluorogenic substrate, and 10 µl of the above preincubation mixture. After incubation at 30°C for 120 min, 500 µl of 50% (v/v) acetic acid was added to terminate the enzyme reaction. The amount of liberated 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin was determined after Kojima et al. (39Kojima K. Kinoshita H. Kato T. Nagatsu T. Takada K. Sakakibara S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) from fluorescence at 460 nm with excitation at 380 nm, using a Hitachi 204-A fluorescence spectrophotometer. For controls the same preincubation mixtures except for the PGRP were prepared and their amidase activity was assayed as above. The peptidyl-NH-Mecs used were the same as those in our previous report (14Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

In this study, we explored the mechanisms by which ceramide induces its cellular effects. In Molt-4 cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) phosphorylation, and ceramide inhibited this effect, suggesting an inhibitory effect of ceramide on the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, the primary target of PMA. Molt-4 cells contained primarily PKCα and βII isoforms of PKC. To determine the effects of ceramide on PKC, we developed an immunoprecipitation assay for PKCα activity. Exposure of Molt-4 cells to C6-ceramide resulted in a concentration and time-dependent inhibition of immunoprecipitated protein kinase Cα (PKCα). Initial inhibition was observed as early as 4.5 h after treatment of cells with C6-ceramide, and the activity was completely lost by 13 h. Inhibition of PKCα activity was seen at concentrations of ceramide as low as 5 µM with maximal effects occurring at a concentration of 15 µM. Both C2 and C6-ceramide were inhibitory, but C2 and C6 dihydroceramides were not. Ceramide did not directly inhibit PKCα in vitro or modulate the levels of PKCα protein, suggesting that ceramide acted indirectly. Moreover, ceramide did not inhibit PMA-induced translocation of PKCα. Taken together, these results suggested that ceramide caused inactivation of PKCα. Since PKC requires phosphorylation for activity, we determined the effects of ceramide on phosphorylation of PKCα. C6-ceramide inhibited basal and PMA-induced phosphorylation of PKCα. In addition, okadaic acid, a potent phosphatase inhibitor, slightly stimulated PKC activity and blocked the effects of ceramide on PKCα inhibition.

The discovery of the existence of a sphingomyelin cycle has stimulated numerous studies of sphingolipids as potential mediators of signaling pathways. Activation of sphingomyelinase by extracellular agents such as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D3), tumor necrosis factor-α, and γ-interferon causes sphingomyelin hydrolysis and leads to the formation of ceramide and phosphocholine (1Okazaki T.

Ceramide then acts as a lipid second messenger to mediate the effects of extracellular agents on cell differentiation, growth inhibition, and programmed cell death. Despite the extensive studies demonstrating the biologic activity of ceramide in vivo, the direct targets of ceramide have not been established. Recently, a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (CAPP) 1The abbreviations used are: CAPPceramide-activated protein phosphatasePKCprotein kinase CDiC8dioctanoylglycerolFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineRbretinoblastomaPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePSphosphatidylserinePP2Aprotein phosphatase 2APAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. has been identified (4Dobrowsky R.T.

Studies have shown that CAPP belongs to the PP2A heterotrimeric subfamily of the serine/threonine protein phosphatases and is potently inhibited by okadaic acid with an IC50 of 1-10 nM (4Dobrowsky R.T.

In addition, activation of CAPP is important in ceramide-induced down-regulation of c-Myc in myeloid leukemia cells (5Wolff R.A. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Studies have also shown that ceramide induces dephosphorylation of Rb (7Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S. Schwarz J.K. Horowitz J.M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dephosphorylation of Rb has been correlated with growth inhibition in response to extracellular agents such as α-interferon, interleukin-6, transforming growth factor β, and serum withdrawal (7Dbaibo G.S.

Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). To date, the molecular mechanisms regulating Rb dephosphorylation/phosphorylation are largely unknown. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated as one of the critical components of signaling pathways regulating cell growth. Protein kinase C activation elicits a variety of cellular response by phosphorylating target proteins on serine/threonine residues. Recent studies have demonstrated that specific inhibitors of PKC block cell proliferation supporting a role for PKC in the proliferation pathway (11Carroll M.P. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1249-1256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms by which ceramide exerts its cellular effects. We show that C6-ceramide indirectly inhibits/inactivates PKCα activity, whereas dihydro-C6-ceramide does not have appreciable effects on PKC activity. Interestingly, C6-ceramide does not inhibit PKC translocation. In addition, we provide evidence that inhibition/inactivation of PKC activity by ceramide may be mediated by protein phosphatases (e.g. CAPP). The implications of these studies on the role of ceramide in signal transduction pathways are discussed. Molt-4 human leukemia cells and Jurkat T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. RPMI 1640 medium was from Life Technologies, Inc.

Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37°C in a humidified incubator. For treatment, Molt-4 cells and Jurkat T cells in log phase growth were washed once with PBS and seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 2% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium. To label phosphoproteins, Molt-4 cells were incubated with 150 µCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (9000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) for 1-2 h in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were washed once with Tris-buffered saline and seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% dialyzed FBS. Following a resting period of 90 min, cells were treated with C6-ceramide (20 µM) for 2 h. In some experiments, the cells were then treated with PMA (0.1 µM) for 20 min. Cells were washed twice with cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were cleared by a 10-min centrifugation at 4°C and then incubated with the indicated antibody for 60 min at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose. Protein A-Sepharose beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and followed by one more wash with kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The beads were boiled in electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described by Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204800) Google Scholar). The gels were stained in staining solution (10% acetic acid, 25% isopropanol, 0.03% Coomassie Brilliant Blue), followed by destaining in 10% acetic acid, 10% isopropanol solution. The gels were then dried and exposed to Fuji RX film at −70°C. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (14Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44561) Google Scholar). The filter was blocked in 5% dried milk in PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in 1 × PBS), incubated in rabbit antiserum against PKC isoenzymes (1:5000 dilution), followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:7500 dilution), washed four times with 1 × PBS, and then developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Corp.). Molt-4 cells were treated with 0.1 µM PMA for 20 min at 37°C. Cells were harvested on ice. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS, resuspended in homogenization buffer and sonicated three times for 10 s each, and centrifuged in a TL-100.3 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 40 min. The supernatant (cytosol) was removed and solubilized with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer. The membrane pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of homogenizing buffer, mixed 1:1 with 2 × sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Protein was measured with bovine serum albumin as the standard by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (209791) Google Scholar). For determination of kinase activity, immunocomplexes bound to protein A-Sepharose beads described above were washed three times with lysis buffer and then washed two more times with kinase buffer. The beads were resuspended in reaction buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 µM cold ATP, 0.4 mg/ml histone H1, and 2.5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN). In some experiments, purified PKC isoenzymes from baculovirus were used. The concentrations of Ca2+, phosphatidylserine (PS), and dioleoylglycerol (diC18:1) under standard mixed micellar conditions were 1.2 mM, 40 µg/ml, and 3.3 µM, respectively. In some experiments, 10 mM EGTA was used to determine the basal kinase activity. The reaction was started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP, and incubation was carried out at 30°C for 10 min (with linear kinetics of incorporation during the interval). The reaction was terminated by the addition of equal volume of 2 × sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel according to the method of Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204800) Google Scholar). The gels were stained, and destained before being dried down for autoradiography. Most studies on Rb phosphorylation status have been performed by evaluating the degrees of phosphorylation on shift in mobility of Rb on SDS-PAGE. It has been demonstrated that ceramide induces dephosphorylation of Rb in several cell lines including Molt-4 cells (7Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S. Schwarz J.K. Horowitz J.M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8Venable M.E. Lee J.Y. Smyth M.J. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30701-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In order to establish the effects of ceramide on Rb phosphorylation and to explore the mechanism(s) by which ceramide regulates Rb dephosphorylation, Molt-4 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and then treated with 20 µM C6-ceramide. Following immunoprecipitation by Rb antibody, the 110-kDa Rb phosphoprotein in Molt-4 cells was detected (Fig. 1). The intensity of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining indicated that the amounts of protein loaded in each lane were approximately equal (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, C6-ceramide inhibited Rb phosphorylation when compared to the control. These results confirmed the previous results that the effects of ceramide on Rb mobility are due to dephosphorylation. PMA, a potent PKC activator, stimulated the basal phosphorylation of Rb in Molt-4 cells. Pretreatment with ceramide inhibited the PMA-induced phosphorylation of Rb (Fig. 1). These studies demonstrate that activation of PKC results in Rb phosphorylation, and they suggest that one component of induction of Rb dephosphorylation by ceramide may be through inhibition of this PKC-dependent pathway. We next considered if ceramide, added to cells, modulated the activity of PKC. Western blot analysis established that the predominant PKC isozymes expressed in Molt-4 cells were α and βII, with trace amounts of βI, ε, and δ (data not shown). We investigated PKCα in our initial studies. In order to evaluate the status of PKCα“activation” in cells, we developed an immunoprecipitation assay for PKCα. In this assay, the Molt-4 extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The lysates were immunoprecipitated by PKCα antisera and collected by protein A-Sepharose beads. The calcium-dependent PKCα activity was then assayed using immunoprecipitates in the absence or presence of calcium and lipid activators: PS and diC18:1, using histone H1 as an exogenous substrate. Fig. 2 shows that extracts immunoprecipitated by PKCα antisera contained a basal level of histone H1 kinase activity and this enzyme activity was markedly enhanced in the presence of PS/diC18:1. Sphingosine was able to inhibit both basal and stimulated PKCα activity (Fig. 2). Therefore, results of these experiments showed that PKCα was indeed calcium-dependent and lipid-stimulated, as well as inhibited by sphingosine. To evaluate the effects of C6-ceramide on PKC activity, we treated Molt-4 cells with 10 µM C6-ceramide for 12 h, and the total extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated by PKCα antisera as before. PKCα activity was then measured in vitro. Fig. 2 shows that the basal and stimulated PKCα activities were dramatically decreased. When sphingosine was added to the kinase reaction mixture, in extracts from cells pretreated with C6-ceramide, it inhibited PKCα activities significantly (Fig. 2). In order to determine whether C6-ceramide specifically inhibited PKCα isoenzyme activity, other existing PKC isoenzymes in Molt-4 cells were examined utilizing the kinase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PKCβII, the other major calcium-dependent isoenzyme present in significant amounts in Molt-4 cells, was also inhibited by C6-ceramide. However, both the basal and stimulated levels of histone H1 kinase activity were approximately 50-fold lower than for PKCα. Other PKC isoenzymes including βI, ε, and δ did not show detectable levels of histone H1 kinase activity (data not shown). Therefore, we carried out our subsequent studies focusing on the PKCα isoenzyme. To further characterize the effects of ceramide on PKCα activity, Molt-4 cells were treated with various concentrations of ceramide for various lengths of time. PKCα inhibition occurred at ceramide concentrations as low as 5 µM, with maximal effects reached at a concentration of 15 µM (Fig. 3A). After 4.5 h of treatment, C6-ceramide (10 µM) significantly diminished calcium-dependent PKCα activity. By 13 h of treatment, both basal and stimulated PKCα activities were almost completely abolished (Fig. 3B). These results show that the inhibition of PKCα activity by ceramide is concentration- and time-dependent. In an attempt to define the specificity of ceramide's effect on PKC inhibition, we compared the effects of equimolar concentrations of several other related lipid molecules. The PKCα activity was markedly inhibited by C6-ceramide and C2-ceramide, whereas the structurally similar C6-dihydroceramide and C2-dihydroceramide were not effective; instead, they appear to slightly stimulate PKC activity. (Fig. 4). Dioctanoylglycerol, DiC8, also had minimal effect on PKCα activity (data not shown). Therefore, the effect of ceramide on inhibition of PKC activity was specific. To demonstrate that the effect of C6-ceramide on PKCα activity was not restricted to Molt-4 cells, we also examined ceramide's effect on PKCα activity using Jurkat T cell line. We found that C6-ceramide exerted a similar effect on PKCα activity in Jurkat cells comparable to Molt-4 cells (Fig. 5). Thus, inhibition of PKCα activity by ceramide observed in Molt-4 cells was not restricted to this cell type. In order to determine the mechanism(s) by which ceramide regulates PKCα activity, we first examined whether C6-ceramide directly affects PKCα activity using an in vitro kinase assay. Purified PKCα from baculovirus was incubated with the kinase reaction mixture including various amounts of C6-ceramide. As shown in Fig. 6A, C6-ceramide had no effect on PKCα activity in vitro as compared to control. This is in contrast to sphingosine, H7, or staurosporine, which inhibited PKCα activity directly (Fig. 6B). Thus, these data indicate that ceramide regulates PKCα activity indirectly. We then examined whether the inhibition of PKCα activity by ceramide was attributed to alteration of PKCα protein. Western blot analysis was carried out on cells treated with ethanol vehicle or 10 µM C6-ceramide using PKCα antisera. Lysates and immunoprecipitated pellets (Fig. 7) from control and ceramide-treated cells had approximately equal amounts of PKCα protein. Therefore, C6-ceramide regulates PKCα activity without altering PKCα protein levels, or the amounts recovered in the immunoprecipitation. To examine whether the effect of ceramide on PKCα is dependent on enzyme translocation, Molt-4 cells were treated with ceramide and followed by PMA stimulation. After 30 min of stimulation by PMA (0.1 µM), membrane and cytosolic fractions were analyzed for PKCα by Western blot. Fig. 8 shows that the addition of PMA caused PKCα translocation in both control and C6-ceramide-treated cells. These data demonstrate that ceramide does not inhibit PKCα translocation but rather inhibits another step required for activation of PKCα. Previous studies have shown that ceramide activates a cytosolic protein phosphatase (CAPP) in vitro (4Dobrowsky R.T. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5048-5051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether CAPP may mediate the cellular action of ceramide. In an attempt to determine the role of CAPP in ceramide's effect on PKCα activity, we investigated the ability of the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, to block the effect of ceramide on inhibiting PKCα activity. Molt-4 cells were treated with okadaic acid in the absence and presence of C6-ceramide (10 µM). PKCα activity was measured using histone H1 as the substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 9 shows that okadaic acid (1-50 nM) enhanced PKCα activity on its own. When Molt-4 cells were treated with okadaic acid and C6-ceramide simultaneously, okadaic acid effectively reversed the effect of C6-ceramide on PKCα inhibition at a concentration as low as 1 nM. The maximal effect of okadaic acid was seen at 10 nM and became less effective when okadaic acid concentration reached 50 nM (Fig. 9). Okadaic acid alone appeared to modestly increase basal and stimulated PKC activity, indicating that inhibition of a phosphatase may be important in PKC regulation. These results also demonstrate that the inhibition of PKCα activity by ceramide is blocked by okadaic acid and may be mediated by a protein phosphatase of the PP2A subfamily, to which CAPP belongs. Since C6-ceramide inhibits PKCα activity, and phosphorylation is an important mode of regulation of PKC activity, we next examined the effects of ceramide on the phosphorylation state of PKCα. Molt-4 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and then treated with 20 µM C6-ceramide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated using PKCα antisera. Subsequent Western blotting revealed the 80-kDa PKCα protein. The intensity of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining indicated that the amounts of protein loaded in each lane were approximately equal (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 10, C6-ceramide significantly inhibited PKCα phosphorylation as compared to the control. When Molt-4 cells were stimulated with 0.1 µM PMA for 30 min, PMA enhanced the basal phosphorylation of PKCα, and ceramide was able to inhibit the PMA-induced PKCα phosphorylation (Fig. 10). These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of PKCα may represent a target for ceramide action. Our data show that ceramide inhibits PKCα activity in Molt-4 and Jurkat T cells. The effects of exogenous ceramide are concentration- and time-dependent, and specific in that the closely related dihydroceramide is not effective. Importantly, our results show that ceramide inhibits PKCα activity indirectly. Alteration of PKCα activity is not due to changes in PKCα levels, since control and ceramide-treated cells had approximately equal amounts of PKCα protein as detected by Western blot. These results suggest that PKC is a downstream target of ceramide action. Membrane translocation of PKC has been observed in response to several PKC activators. PKC can participate in signaling pathways through direct translocation from cytosol to membrane, where it is activated by diacylglycerol. Therefore, a potential mechanism by which ceramide inhibits PKC activity is by inhibiting PKC translocation. Our study using Molt-4 cells demonstrates that inhibition of PKCα activity by C6-ceramide is independent of enzyme translocation (Fig. 8). This is in agreement with other studies from our laboratory using HL-60 cells where both PKCα and PKCβII translocation was not inhibited by C6-ceramide. 2M. E. Venable and L. M. Obeid, unpublished results. In contrast to our studies, Jones and Murray demonstrated that ceramide inhibits the translocation of PKCα but not PKCε using mouse epidermal (HEL-37) or human skin fibroblast (SF3155) cells (16Jones M.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5007-5013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The translocation of PKCα induced by DiC8 in HEL-37 cells was inhibited by sphingomyelinase treatment or C2-ceramide only in the absence of Triton X-100. The discrepancy between these studies may be due to differences in experimental procedure or may be attributed to different responses of cells used. A major conclusion of our study is that ceramide appears to “inactivate” PKCα. This is supported by the following lines of evidence. First, the effects of ceramide are not a result of direct interaction of ceramide with PKCα. Our in vitro studies show that sphingosine but not C6-ceramide is capable of inhibiting immunoprecipitated PKCα. This supports previous in vitro studies (17Merrill Jr., A.H. Nimkar S. Menaldino D. Hannun Y.A. Loomis C. Bell R.M. Tyagi S.R. Lambeth J.D. Stevens V.L. Hunter R. Liotta D.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) that C2-ceramide does not inhibit PKC in vitro. Second, the inhibition of PKCα by ceramide in cells is maintained when PKCα is immunoprecipitated. This suggests that ceramide either causes inactivation of PKCα or it induces the co-immunoprecipitation of an inhibitory protein. The studies on phosphorylation of PKCα support the first possibility, namely that ceramide causes inactivation of PKCα through dephosphorylation. In addition to regulation of protein kinase C by lipids such as phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol (18Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4195) Google Scholar, 19Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), phosphorylation has emerged as an additional and important mode of regulation for PKC. Protein kinase C is first synthesized as a dephosphorylated, membrane-bound inactive precursor with an apparent molecular mass of 74 kDa. The 80-kDa mature protein is probably formed via post-translational modification such as phosphorylation (21Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Wartmann M. Eppenberger U. Fabbro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13902-13909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several recent reports have revealed that phosphorylation at the activation loop activates the enzyme (22Cazaubon S.M. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17559-17563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 24Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation on PKC's activation loop leads to loss of its activity (24Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study utilizing the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) to dephosphorylate PKC revealed that PKC is phosphorylated at two different sites (25Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC is activated by trans-phosphorylation at the activation loop followed by autophosphorylation at the carboxyl terminus. This finding is consistent with the model that phosphorylation is an important modulator of PKC activity. Previous studies clearly demonstrated that the phosphorylation state of PKC and its subsequent activation is dynamically controlled by a variety of intracellular and extracellular agents. The foregoing results show that C6-ceramide inhibits phosphorylation of PKCα, suggesting that alteration of the phosphorylation state of PKC may be an important mechanism for ceramide action. How does ceramide induce dephosphorylation of PKCα? Previous studies have demonstrated that ceramide activates a cytosolic protein phosphatase (CAPP) in vitro (4Dobrowsky R.T. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5048-5051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAPP was found to share several properties with protein phosphatase 2A leading to the hypothesis that ceramide may be a specific lipid activator of PP2A (4Dobrowsky R.T. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5048-5051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PP2A is a heterotrimeric enzyme consisting of a catalytic (C) subunit and A and B regulatory subunits. The initial studies showed that ceramide activation requires the presence of the B subunit (26Dobrowsky R.T. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15523-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study, however, showed that the A and B′ subunits are not necessary for activation by ceramide (27Law B. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12808-12813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional subunits may be involved in the ceramide response. One study has shown that okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases and CAPP, prevents the effects of C2-ceramide on c-Myc down-regulation in HL-60 cells (5Wolff R.A. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19605-19609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we found that okadaic acid reverses the action of ceramide on inhibiting PKCα activity (Fig. 9). These studies suggest that the activation of PP2A by ceramide may account for subsequent intracellular events including the inhibition of PKCα. A cell-free kinase-phosphatase preparation from Molt-4 cells would enable us to test the link between ceramide-induced phosphatase activation and subsequent intracellular events. One other issue raised from these studies pertains to the specificity of PKC isoenzyme inhibition by C6-ceramide. The fact that C6-ceramide also inhibits/inactivates PKCβII activity (data not shown) suggests that inhibition/inactivation of PKC by ceramide is not limited to the α isoenzyme and is likely to be mediated by a common mechanism. These studies also raise important implications/suggestions as to the regulation of Rb dephosphorylation by ceramide. Previous studies have shown that Rb functions as a downstream target for ceramide in the regulation of cell growth (7Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S. Schwarz J.K. Horowitz J.M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which ceramide induces Rb dephosphorylation are unknown. The results from the present study suggest that one component of dephosphorylation of Rb by ceramide may be through inhibition of PKC. It is also conceivable that ceramide may inhibit/inactivate other (and more direct) Rb kinase such as cyclin/CDK2/4. Studies are under way to evaluate this possibility. Earlier studies have shown that both sphingosine and ceramide share some biologic effects such as inducing Rb dephosphorylation (7Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S. Schwarz J.K. Horowitz J.M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8Venable M.E. Lee J.Y. Smyth M.J. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30701-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 28Chao R. Khan W. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23459-23462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since sphingosine is a potent and reversible inhibitor of PKC (29Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an important point raised by these studies concerns whether ceramide's effects on inhibiting PKCα activity is dependent on its conversion to sphingosine. Several lines of evidence lead us to conclude that the effects of C6-ceramide on PKC inhibition are independent of sphingosine. First, in previous studies it was shown that C6-ceramide was rapidly taken up by Molt-4 cells, and very little metabolism of C6-ceramide was observed up to 20 h after treatment (7Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S. Schwarz J.K. Horowitz J.M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Second, in studies on the effects of serum deprivation on Rb dephosphorylation, it was found that endogenous sphingosine levels did not change significantly after prolonged serum deprivation. Ceramide levels, however, were markedly increased under the same condition. Most importantly, the elevation of ceramide levels correlated with Rb dephosphorylation (7Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S. Schwarz J.K. Horowitz J.M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Finally, in vitro studies show that the effects of sphingosine on PKC are reversible and due to competitive inhibition of the regulatory domain (29Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, ceramide resulted in dephosphorylation and “irreversible” inhibition of PKCα such that the immunoprecipitated PKC was still inhibited following exposure to ceramide. A final point raised by these studies concerns the mechanisms responsible for ceramide-induced programmed cell death. Ceramide has been demonstrated to be a potent inducer of apoptosis in many cell types including U937 cells (30Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar) and HL-60 cells (31Jarvis W.D. Kolesnick R.N. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Gewirtz D.A. Grant S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C activators abolish apoptosis (32Tomei L.D. Kanter P. Werner C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 33McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Jondal M. Orrenius S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9980-9987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study reported that PKC inhibitors block hyperphosphorylation of BCL2α and lead to apoptosis, whereas PKC activators mediate hyperphosphorylation of BCL2α and suppress apoptosis (35May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional findings from a recent study showed that protein kinase C activation blocks ceramide production and ceramide-induced apoptosis (36Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Our present studies provide further evidence for the potential role of PKC in the proliferation and/or the anti-cell death pathways. Blockade of this function by ceramide or other extracellular agents may be a potent inducer of cell death. In summary, ceramide emerges as an important lipid mediator capable of influencing cell growth and apoptosis. In light of the present findings, it is highly likely that PKC is a downstream target in the ceramide growth regulatory pathway. Our results also suggest the existence of cross-talk between the two important lipid-mediated pathways of signal transduction, namely the diacylglycerol/PKC pathway and ceramide/CAPP pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2106219094,"Distinct yet overlapping sets of STAT transcription factors are activated by different cytokines. One example is the differential activation of acute phase response factor (APRF, also called Stat3) and Stat1 by interleukin 6 and interferon-γ. Interleukin 6 activates both factors while, at least in human cells, interferon-γ recruits only Stat1. Stat1 activation by interferon-γ is mediated through a cytosolic tyrosine motif, Y440, of the interferon-γ receptor. In an accompanying paper (Gerhartz, C., Heesel, B., Sasse, J., Hemmann, U., Landgraf, C., Schneider-Mergener, J., Horn, F., Heinrich, P. C., and Graeve, L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 12991-12998), we demonstrated that two tyrosine motifs within the cytoplasmic part of the interleukin 6 signal transducer gp130 specifically mediate APRF activation while two others can recruit both APRF and Stat1. By expressing a series of Stat1/APRF domain swap mutants in COS-7 cells, we now determined which domains of Stat1 and APRF are involved in the specific recognition of phosphotyrosine motifs. Our data demonstrate that the SH2 domain is the sole determinant of specific STAT factor recruitment. Furthermore, the SH2 domain of Stat1 is able to recognize two unrelated types of phosphotyrosine motifs, one represented by the interferon-γ receptor Y440DKPH peptide, and the other by two gp130 YXPQ motifs. By molecular modeling, we propose three-dimensional model structures of the Stat1 and APRF SH2 domains which allow us to explain the different binding preferences of these factors and to predict amino acids crucial for specific peptide recognition.

Most interleukins, colony-stimulating factors, and interferons bind to plasma membrane receptors which are members of the hematopoietic receptor superfamily (1Bazan J.F. Immunol.

The transcription factors Stat1α, Stat1β, and Stat2, formerly known as p91, p84, and p113 components, respectively, of the IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 complex were shown to be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IFNα (3Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) and Stat1 also by IFNγ (4Shuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Subsequent to their phosphorylation, STAT factors homo- or heterodimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to regulatory DNA elements of target genes. STAT factors contain putative SH3 and SH2 domains in their carboxyl-terminal parts as well as potential leucine zipper-like α-helical structures toward their amino termini (6Fu X.Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The SH2 domains seem to be involved in both the activation process and the dimerization of the STATs (7Shuai K.

A centrally located portion of Stat1 has recently been demonstrated to represent its DNA-binding domain (8Horvath C.M. Wen Z.L. Darnell J.E. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs is most likely catalyzed by members of the JAK family of protein-tyrosine kinases (9Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F.

To date, four members of that family, Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2, have been cloned, of which Jak1 and Tyk2 have been shown to be essential for IFNα signaling while Jak1 and Jak2 are required in the IFNγ pathway (10Velazquez L.

Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that, in addition to APRF(Stat3), Stat1 is also activated in response to IL-6 (16Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G.

Further insight into the mechanisms of STAT activation originated from our observation that IL-6 induces the transient association of the STATs with the signal transducer gp130 (16Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that the phosphorylation of STAT factors occurs at the cytokine receptor cytoplasmic parts. In fact, recent data indicate that the activation of Stat1 by IFNγ relies on the interaction of its SH2 domain with a phosphotyrosine motif, Y440DKPH, of the IFNγ receptor α chain (IFNγR) (26Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 27Greenlund A.C. Morales M.O. Viviano B.L. Yan H. Krolewski J. Schreiber R.D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 677-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Similarly, the activation of IL-4-STAT (STAT6) by IL-4 requires specific phosphotyrosine motifs in the IL-4 receptor α subunit (28Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In the case of gp130, Stahl et al. (29Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) have reported that four tyrosine motifs conforming to the consensus sequence YXXQ are all able to independently mediate APRF(Stat3) activation. Recent studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that two of these YXXQ motifs (Y767RHQ and Y814FKQ) give rise to the specific activation of APRF(Stat3) while the other two (Y905LPQ and Y915MPQ) are capable of mediating the activation of both APRF(Stat3) and Stat1 (56Gerhartz C.

The sequences of the latter motifs, however, do not resemble the IFNγR Y440DKPH motif. This raised the question of how Stat1 can be activated through two distinct types of phosphotyrosine motifs. Is the Stat1 SH2 domain able to recognize different motifs on its own or are additional domains of Stat1 involved? By use of a series of Stat1/Stat3 chimeras we now demonstrate that the Stat1 SH2 domain is both required and sufficient to direct the activation through both the IFNγR Y440DKPH motif and the gp130 YXPQ motifs. A domain swap mutant in which the SH2 domain of APRF(Stat3) was replaced by the one of Stat1 exhibited the same activation specificity as wild-type Stat1. This finding demonstrates that solely the SH2 domain defines the interaction of STATs with gp130, and that the SH2 domain of Stat1 is able to interact with distinct types of phosphotyrosine motifs. Furthermore, we present three-dimensional model structures of the Stat1 and APRF(Stat3) SH2 domains which were built by using known SH2 domain structures as templates. Based on these models we are now able to explain the different specificities of the two STAT factors for receptor phosphotyrosine motifs. In addition, these models allow us to predict amino acids within the SH2 domains that are crucial for specific STAT factor/cytokine receptor interactions. Enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, DMEM and antibiotics from Life Technologies, Inc., and fetal calf serum from Seromed (Berlin, Germany). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium), Biometra (Göttingen, Germany), and MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Radiochemicals were from Amersham. Recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) was a generous gift of Boehringer Mannheim. Antisera to Stat1 and Stat3 have been described previously (24Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 30Schindler C. Fu X.Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7836-7839Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). A cDNA coding for the murine Epo receptor (EpoR) was provided by H. Lodish (Cambridge, MA). M2 monoclonal antibodies to the FLAG epitope (sequence DYKDDDDK) were from Kodak/ICI. SalI sites were introduced 3′ of the stop codons into murine APRF(Stat3) and human Stat1 cDNAs that were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) vectors through site-directed mutagenesis (U.S.E. Mutagenesis Kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) generating the plasmids pB-Stat3-Sal and pB-Stat1-Sal, respectively. The pSVL-Stat3 and pSVL-Stat1 expression vectors were then constructed by subcloning the coding sequences into a pSVL vector (Pharmacia) which had been modified by eliminating the unique SalI site in the vector backbone and instead introducing a SalI site into the polylinker region. For the construction of cDNAs coding for Stat1/Stat3 chimeric molecules, additional unique restriction sites were introduced into the STAT cDNAs by site-directed mutagenesis. BamHI sites were introduced into pB-Stat3-Sal and pB-Stat1-Sal changing APRF(Stat3) codons 697-699 into GCG GAT CCA (silent mutation) and Stat1 codons 693-695 into CTG GAT CCC (thereby replacing glycine 695 by proline), respectively. The introduction of an XbaI site into pB-Stat3-Sal changed codons 716-717 to TCT AGA and replaced threonines 716 and 717 by serine and arginine, respectively. The corresponding position in the Stat1 cDNAs (codons 715-716) already carries a unique XbaI site. By using the authentic SphI (codons 324-326 in Stat1 and 328-330 in Stat3), TaqI (Stat3 codons 569-570), and MseI (Stat1 codons 565-566) sites, and the newly introduced BamHI and XbaI sites, chimeric STAT cDNAs were constructed by exchanging the respective DNA fragments within the pBluescript vector context. The cDNAs were then subcloned into pSVL. All constructs were sequenced throughout chimeric and mutated regions. The “R602Q” point mutation in the Stat1 SH2 domain was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (U.S.E. kit, Pharmacia), changing Stat1 codon 602 from CGG (arginine) to CAG (glutamine). Further details on expression vector construction are available upon request. An expression vector coding for a chimeric receptor which consists of the murine Epo receptor (EpoR) extracellular part and the human gp130 transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts was constructed as follows. Murine EpoR cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript, and a unique EcoRI site was introduced into codons 246/247 by insertion of a linker oligonucleotide at the nearby NheI site. An XbaI-EcoRI fragment containing the portion of the cDNA coding for the EpoR extracellular part was then subcloned into the XbaI and EcoRI sites of pSVL-gp130 (31Dittrich E. Rose-John S. Gerhartz C. Müllberg J. Stoyan T. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19014-19020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) thereby fusing EpoR codon 245 in frame to gp130 codon 605. Construction of the expression vectors pSVL-Eg-FLAG, pSVL-EgYγ440, pSVL-EgY767, pSVL-EgY814, pSVL-EgY905, and pSVL-EgY915 is described elsewhere (56Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U.

COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 µg/ml), and penicillin (100 IU/ml). Cells were transfected by electroporation with a single pulse at 230 V and 960 µF using a Gene Pulser™ (Bio-Rad). Approximately 2 × 106 cells were cotransfected in 0.8 ml of medium with 10 µg and 20 µg of expression vectors for receptor chimeras and STAT proteins, respectively. After electroporation, the cells were grown to confluency (48 to 72 h) and stimulated by adding human recombinant Epo (7 units/ml) to the medium for 15 min. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described (32Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). DNA binding of STAT factors was analyzed by EMSA using a double-stranded 32P-labeled m67SIE-oligonucleotide derived from the sis-inducible element of the c-fos promoter region (33Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). EMSA was carried out as described previously (19Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5% glycerol in 0.25 TBE for 4 h. The gels were fixed for 30 min in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol in water, dried, and autoradiographed, or analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For supershift analysis of STAT/DNA complexes nuclear extracts were incubated in the gel shift mixture with antisera at a final dilution of 1:20 at room temperature for 30 min. The m67SIE-oligonucleotide probe was then added and the EMSA was performed. Cells were lysed as described previously (16Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of cellular protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred to polyvinyldifluoride membranes using a semi-dry electroblotting apparatus, and antigens detected by incubation with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. The membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham). For manipulation and graphic representation of protein structures, the programs Whatif (34Vriend G. J. Mol.

Energy minimizations were performed under vacuum conditions with the GROMOS program library (W.F van Gunsteren, distributed by BIOMOS Biomolecular Software B.V., Laboratory of Physical Chemistry, University of Groningen, The Netherlands). The following SH2 domain sequences and structures were used as templates: phospholipase C-γ1, Brookhaven data bank entry code 2pld (36Pascal S.M. Singer A.U. Gish G. Yamazaki T. Shoelson S.E.

Initial amino acid sequence alignments of Stat1 and APRF(Stat3) with sequences of known structures was according to Shuai et al. (7Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H.T. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) with minor changes due to structural requirements derived from the known SH2 structures. The sequential alignment of the known structures is based on the direct superposition of their backbone coordinates. The alignment implies a large insertion within the CD loops of both STAT SH2 domains (see Fig. 7) for which the template structures could not serve as a model. We therefore did not include this region in our models. Using the structures mentioned above as templates, residues were exchanged according to the alignment. For amino acid insertions or deletions in loop regions, data base searches implemented in the used software were performed. After exchanging all residues using a data base search approach (34Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar), graphical inspection showed an already good packing of side chains in the hydrophobic core of the domains which subsequently was optimized by side chain rotations and energy calculations. Binding of IFNγR and gp130 phosphotyrosine peptides to the STAT SH2 domains was modeled by using the coordinates of peptides pYIIPL (pY, phosphotyrosine) and pYVPML bound to the phospholipase C-γ1 and v-src kinase SH2 domains, respectively (36Pascal S.M.

Nature. 1992; 358: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In many cell types, IL-6 gives rise to the activation of both APRF(Stat3) and Stat1 while, at least in human cells, IFNγ activates Stat1 only. To determine which domains of Stat3 and Stat1 define this differential pattern of activation, we constructed expression vectors coding for a series of Stat3/Stat1 chimeric molecules 2Note that throughout this paper, chimeric molecules are referred to as Stat1/Stat3 or EpoR/gp130, for example, while STAT heterodimers are indicated as Stat1-Stat3. as schematically shown in Fig. 1A. Chimera Stat3/1 combined the amino-terminal half of Stat3 with the carboxyl-terminal half of Stat1α. In the other chimeras, internal parts of Stat3 were replaced by the respective Stat1 sequences. In Stat3/1[D, SH3 + 2, Y] and Stat3/1[D, SH3 + 2], the DNA-binding, SH3, and SH2 domains in combination with and without the Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation site, respectively, were from Stat1 while in Stat3/1[SH2] only the Stat3 SH2 domain was replaced by the one of Stat1 (Fig. 1A). COS-7 cells were used to overexpress wild-type and chimeric STAT proteins by transient transfection. Due to the presence of the IL-6 gp130 signal transducer in these cells, endogenous STAT factors can be activated by the addition of IL-6 plus soluble IL-6 receptor to the medium (56Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; : 12991-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To selectively target the transfected cells, an expression vector was cotransfected that coded for a chimeric receptor, Eg, combining the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gp130 (Fig. 1B). The cells were then stimulated by addition of erythropoietin (Epo) to the medium. Activation of endogenous STAT factors was monitored by EMSA using the high affinity mutant m67SIE of the c-fos promoter sis-inducible element as a probe (33Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Epo did not activate STAT binding in nontransfected COS-7 cells but triggered the appearance of a protein-DNA complex in Eg-expressing cells (Fig. 2). By supershift analysis using specific antisera to Stat1α and Stat3, this complex was demonstrated to be formed by Stat1α (Fig. 3). In contrast, only marginal activation of endogenous Stat3 was observed under the same conditions (Fig. 2). Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of high amounts of Stat1α but low levels of Stat3 in these cells (Fig. 2, lower panels) as reported earlier by Zhang et al. (42Zhang X.K. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Supershift analysis of wild-type and chimeric STAT proteins expressed in COS-7 cells. Human Stat1α, murine Stat3, and chimeric Stat1/Stat3 molecules were coexpressed with receptor hybrid Eg in COS-7 cells by transient transfection. Cells were stimulated for 15 min with 7 units/ml Epo, harvested, and nuclear proteins were extracted. Prior to the EMSA, the extracts were incubated in the EMSA mixture without or with polyclonal antisera to Stat1α (α1) or Stat3 (α3) at 1:20 final dilution, as indicated. The epitopes recognized by the antibodies are indicated in Fig. 1. Dots and lines indicate the positions of the three types of DNA-protein complexes formed, corresponding to Stat1α homodimers (lower band), heterodimers (middle band), and either Stat3 or chimera homodimers (top band).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the chimeric receptor Eg has the potential of activating both STAT factors in COS-7 cells, we next cotransfected Stat1α or Stat3 expression vectors. Coexpression of Stat1α yielded only slightly enhanced activation of the factor (Fig. 2). Overexpression of Stat3, however, which gave rise to strongly enhanced Stat3 levels as detected by immunoblotting, resulted in the appearance of three DNA-protein complexes upon Epo treatment (Fig. 2). Supershift analysis demonstrated that the predominant, slowest migrating band was only recognized by Stat3 antiserum and hence are formed by Stat3 homodimers whereas the middle and high-mobility bands represent complexes containing Stat3-Stat1α heterodimers, and Stat1α homodimers, respectively (Fig. 3). We conclude from these experiments that the chimeric receptor Eg can give rise to the activation of both Stat1α and Stat3 in COS-7 cells. We next asked whether usage of hybrid receptors allows us to reproduce the differential STAT activation in response to IL-6 and IFNγ. Activation of Stat1 by IFNγ has been shown to rely on phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 440 of the IFNγR (26Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D.

In a first, kinetically distinct step, the HA polypeptide chain 2 (HA2) is inserted into the target membrane bilayer. Using hydrophobic photolabeling with the phospholipid analogue 1-O-hexadecanoyl-2-O-[9-[[[2-[125I]iodo-4(trifluoromethyl-3H-diazirin-3-yl)benzyl]oxy]carbonyl]nonanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, we identified the segment within HA2 that interacts with the membrane. The sole part of the HA2 ectodomain that was labeled with the membrane-restricted reagent is the NH2-terminal fusion peptide (residues 1-22). No labeling occurred within the long coiled coil region generated during the acid-induced conformational transition (Bullough, P. A., Hughson, F. M., Skehel, J. J., and Wiley, D. C. (1994) Nature 371, 37-43). These data strongly suggest that the coiled coil region of HA2 does not insert into the lipid bilayer. This conclusion is at variance with the recent suggestion (Yu, Y. G., King, D. S., and Shin, Y.-K. (1994) Science 266, 274-276) that the coiled coil of HA may splay apart and insert into the target membrane, providing a mechanism by which the viral and the target membrane may come in close apposition."
https://openalex.org/W2035172570,"A mutant of Escherichia coli lacking phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and a monoclonal antibody (mAb 4B1) directed against a conformationally sensitive epitope (4B1) of lactose permease were used to establish a novel role for a phospholipid in the assembly of a membrane protein. Epitope 4B1 is readily detectable in spheroplasts and right-side-out membrane vesicles from PE-containing but not from PE-deficient cells expressing lactose permease. Lactose permease from PE-containing membranes, but not from PE-deficient membranes, subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis is also recognized by mAb 4B1. If total E. coli phospholipids or PE (but not phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, or cardiolipin) are blotted on nitrocellulose sheets (Eastern blot) prior to transfer of proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the permease from PE-deficient cells regains its recognition by mAb 4B1. Therefore, PE is required during assembly to form epitope 4B1, but, once formed, sufficient “conformational memory” is retained in the permease to either retain or reform this epitope in the absence of PE. Lactose permease lacking epitope 4B1 can be induced to form the epitope if partially denatured and then renatured in the presence of PE specifically. These results establish for the first time a role for PE as a molecular chaperone in the assembly of the lactose permease.

These results establish for the first time a role for PE as a molecular chaperone in the assembly of the lactose permease. Only a limited number of reports address the role of the native phospholipid environment in the function and assembly of membrane proteins. Clearly, the amphipathic environment of the membrane is an important determinant in the folding and maintenance of membrane protein structure. However, what has not been widely considered is a role for individual phospholipids in determining the folding pathway for membrane proteins independent from the maintenance of the final structure, i.e. to act in the capacity of a non-protein molecular chaperone. Mutants of Escherichia coli are available in which membrane phospholipid composition can be varied in a way that is difficult to achieve in vitro (DeChavigny et al., 8.DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N.

The lactose permease of E. coli is an extensively studied prototype of most secondary transport systems found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (Kaback et al., 1994). PE is not required for energy-independent downhill translocation of substrate mediated by lactose permease, but appears to be essential for H+-coupled active lactose accumulation in vivo (Bogdanov and Dowhan, 1995). These results parallel the earlier observation (Chen and Wilson, 7.Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol.

How phospholipids affect membrane protein assembly and function is still largely unknown. Do the properties of the target membrane phospholipids affect assembly and function? Do individual phospholipids act as conformational determinants? In the present work, we address the possibility that membrane phospholipid composition, and specifically PE, determines the conformation of the lactose permease. The experiments described here combine structural and functional information on the lactose permease with the use of a conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibody (Sun et al., 21.Sun J. Wu J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) directed against an epitope in the periplasmic loop [L(VII/VIII)] of the permease between helices VII and VIII (Fig. 1). Monoclonal antibodies have been used effectively to detect folding intermediates of soluble proteins in solution (Fedorov et al., 11.Fedorov A.N. Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Alakhov Y.B. Goldberg M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but have not been used extensively to follow folding of membrane proteins as described in this report. The proper assembly of lactose permease, as assessed by the presence of the conformational epitope, into the membranes of an E. coli mutant lacking PE (DeChavigny et al., 1991) was compared to assembly in wild type cells to establish a requirement for PE. We also introduce a novel adaption of the Western blot procedure termed an “Eastern-Western” in which phospholipids are applied to the surface of nitrocellulose sheets (Taki et al., 22.Taki T. Handa S. Ishikava D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) prior to transfer of proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gels by electroblotting. This combination of protein and ligand on a solid support allows the monitoring by a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody of the involvement of a specific phospholipid in the refolding of a denatured protein. The information gathered from these approaches indicate that PE plays an important role in facilitating the proper assembly of the lactose permease into the membrane and thereby demonstrates for the first time that a phospholipid can act as a molecular chaperone. E. coli strain AD93 (pss93::kan, PE-deficient) cannot make either PE or phosphatidylserine except when carrying plasmid pDD72 (pss+, PE-containing) (DeChavigny et al., 1991). All strains (mutant and wild type for PE formation) were grown at 30°C in LB medium containing 50 mM MgCl2 and, except as noted, carried multiple copies of the lacY gene on plasmid pT7-5/lacY (Bibi and Kaback, 1.Bibi E. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4325-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and IPTG (1 mM) were included in the growth medium to maintain plasmid pT7-5/lacY and induce lactose permease synthesis, respectively. A modification of the protocol of van Veen et al.(24.van Veen H.W. Abee T. Korstee G.J.J. Konings W.N. Zehnder A.J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19377-19383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to make spheroplasts. Midexponential phase cells were suspended in 10 mM potassium PIPES (pH 7.0), 0.75 M sucrose, 10 mM MgSO4, 2.5% (w/v) LiCl, and 50 mg/ml chloramphenicol. After addition of either 1 mg/ml or 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme to pss+ or pss- cells, respectively, cell suspensions were chilled to 2°C, warmed to room temperature, and subsequently incubated with gentle shaking at 30°C for 30 min or 5 min for pss+ cells or pss- cells, respectively. Intact spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation (3,000 × gav for 10 min) at room temperature and resuspended at 10 mg/ml total protein in the above buffer without LiCl. RSO membrane vesicles were made by diluting a pellet of spheroplasts into a 50-fold volume of 10 mM potassium PIPES buffer (pH 7.0). The solution was adjusted to 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 10 mg/ml deoxyribonuclease and incubated for 10 min on ice. Intact cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 4000 × gav for 5 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 30,000 × gav for 30 min at 4°C. Resulting RSO membrane vesicles were suspended to a final concentration of 2 mg of membrane protein/ml in 50 mM potassium PIPES (pH 7.0) containing 10 mM MgCl2. ISO membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (Bogdanov and Dowhan, 1995) and were resuspended at 10 mg/ml in ice-cold 100 mM potassium HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 125 mM sucrose, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA method as suggested by the supplier (Pierce). Aliquots (0.05 ml) of stock spheroplasts, RSO membrane vesicles, or ISO membrane vesicles were diluted 10-fold into suspension buffer (100 mM potassium HEPES (pH 8.0), 125 mM sucrose, 10 mM MgCl2) containing 5% bovine serum albumin followed by the addition of 5 μl of affinity-purified mAb 4B1 (5 mg/ml). After incubation at room temperature for 45 min, mixtures were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × gav for spheroplasts or 30 min at 30,000 × gav for RSO and ISO membrane vesicles. Pellets were washed twice with suspension buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin and resuspended in a final volume of 0.5 ml of suspension buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin. 35S-Protein A (2.5 μl, Amersham) was added and incubation was continued for 45 min. Samples were centrifuged as above, washed sequentially with suspension buffer first containing 5% bovine serum albumin and second without bovine serum albumin, and finally resuspended in suspension buffer without bovine serum albumin to the final protein concentration of 10.5 mg/ml for spheroplasts and 2.3 mg/ml for RSO or ISO membrane vesicles. Aliquots of membrane suspensions were adjusted to the concentration of SDS gel loading buffer (2.8% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mM DTT) and heated at 37°C for 15 min prior to being subjected to PAGE in 12.5% gels containing 0.1% SDS. Transfer of proteins from gels to nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schuell, pore size of 0.45 μm) using a semidry electroblotting system (Milliblot-SDE electroblotting apparatus) and detection by antibody were carried out as described previously (Bogdanov and Dowhan, 1995) except as follows. The gel was incubated for 10 min at room temperature in cathode buffer 1 (electroblotting system) prior to transfer. Bound antibody (mAb 4B1 or pAb) was visualized by either the ECL detection system (Amersham with supplied peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody, respectively) and exposure to x-ray film or 35S-protein A and analysis with a Betagene Imager as described previously (Bogdanov and Dowhan, 1995). In the Eastern-Western blot procedure, bands of phospholipids (0.05-0.10 mg) on silica gel thin layer plates were developed using chloroform/methanol/water/30% ammonium hydroxide (120:75:6:2, v/v); for total E. coli phospholipids, no chromatography was performed. Plates were dipped in isopropyl alcohol/0.2% aqueous CaCl2/methanol (40:20:7, v/v) for 20 s. A nitrocellulose sheet was placed on top of the silica gel surface followed by a glass microfiber sheet (Whatman, United Kingdom). Transfer of phospholipid was accomplished by pressing on the stack with a metallic heating block at 130°C for 10 s (modification of Taki et al.(1994)). Western blot transfer (phospholipid side facing the acrylamide gel) of proteins was accomplished as described above. The binding of mAb 4B1 to RSO membrane vesicles and spheroplasts was utilized to determine whether structural differences exist between lactose permease assembled in either PE-deficient or PE-containing membranes. As shown in Fig. 2A, binding of mAb 4B1 to spheroplasts and RSO membrane vesicles from PE-deficient cells is reduced to the level observed for binding to control membranes lacking the permease. High level binding to permease in membranes from PE-containing cells was observed as reported previously (Carrasco et al., 3.Carrasco N. Tahara S.M. Patel L. Goldkorn T. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6894-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4.Carrasco N. Viitanen P. Herzlinger D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3681-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar; Herzlinger et al., 13.Herzlinger D. Viitanen P. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar; Sun et al., 1996). The amount of permease in each membrane preparation was established using Western blot analysis with a site-directed pAb against the C terminus of the permease using either the ECL chemiluminescence-based method (Fig. 2B) or radiolabeled protein A (Fig. 2C) for qualitative or quantitative measurements, respectively. The specific content of permease in spheroplasts (500 and 600 cpm/mg of total membrane protein) and RSO membrane vesicles (6000 and 7000 cpm/mg of membrane protein) was comparable in samples prepared from PE-containing and PE-deficient cells, respectively. Therefore, the marked difference in mAb 4B1 binding to membranes is due specifically to differences in recognition of the epitope. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that membrane phospholipid composition is a determinant for the conformation of lactose permease. Membrane preparations from PE-containing and PE-deficient cells were then analyzed by Western blot analysis, comparing the sensitivity of SDS-denatured permease to detection with mAb 4B1 and pAb (Fig. 3A). As reported previously (Carrasco et al., 1982), mAb 4B1 binds to permease from PE-containing cells after being transferred to a solid support. Permease from PE-deficient cells exhibits greatly reduced binding of mAb 4B1, although probing with pAb verified the presence of ample amounts of permease (Fig. 3B). Therefore, permease assembled in PE-containing membranes retains sufficient “conformational memory” to reform the native structure of the epitope after removal of SDS. The results confirm the absence of the conformational epitope in PE-deficient membranes and also suggest that once the information is imparted to form the epitope in PE-containing cells, PE is no longer required to maintain the epitope. To further investigate the role of phospholipids in the formation of this conformational epitope, the Eastern-Western blot procedure was developed. By combining these two procedures (Fig. 4), denatured proteins are exposed to hydrated phospholipids on the surface of nitrocellulose sheets as they exit the polyacrylamide gel and begin to refold in the absence of SDS. The surprising finding is that lactose permease from PE-deficient membranes subjected to Eastern-Western blotting with either PE or E. coli phospholipids regains the ability to bind mAb 4B1. In marked contrast, neither the E. coli anionic phospholipids PG and CL nor PC, which is also zwitterionic but not present in E. coli, promote the formation of the epitope. This specificity for PE is consistent with the earlier results of Chen and Wilson(1984) who showed that only PE and not the other three phospholipids listed above could restore active transport to lactose permease reconstituted in proteoliposomes. Therefore, restoration of mAb 4B1 binding specifically by PE indicates that PE plays a positive role as a structural determinant, rather than acting to exclude a negative determinant in the form of anionic phospholipids. Subjecting membrane preparations to SDS-PAGE in the presence of 5 M urea eliminates detection by mAb 4B1 in both Western and Eastern-Western blots with permease from both PE-containing and PE-deficient cells (data not shown). Lactose permease retains about 70% of its helical structure in SDS as estimated from circular dichroism measurements, 2D. L. Foster, M. Boublik, and H. R. Kaback, unpublished data. and recent evidence indicates that denaturants such as SDS induce alterations in helical packing within the permease with little or no change in secondary structure (Jung et al., 15.Jung K. Jung H. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, urea disrupts the secondary structure of proteins by stabilizing the random coil state (Schein, 18.Schein C.H. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the case of the permease, urea appears to eliminate structural elements that either carry conformational memory after assembly in the presence of PE in vivo or have potential to form the 4B1 epitope. The possibility that residual PE is bound to permease from PE-containing cells was eliminated by labeling membrane phospholipids by growth in the presence of 32Pi, followed by SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography of the gel revealed no difference in the labeling pattern between samples from PE-containing cells with or without lactose permease. However, bands in other regions of the gel exhibited significant radioactivity, indicating that the 32Pi was of sufficiently high specific activity to detect low levels of protein-associated radiolabel such as tightly bound PE. Therefore, the 4B1 epitope once formed is maintained even in the absence of PE. Finally, when PE-deficient membranes are solubilized in the presence of PE-containing liposomes (12.5 mg of total membrane protein plus 50 mg of either PE or wild type E. coli phospholipid), no restoration of mAb 4B1 binding is observed (data not shown), indicating that formation of the epitope is dependent on removal of SDS in the presence of PE rather than simply exposure of the denatured protein to PE. The epitope recognized by mAb 4B1 (see Fig. 1) consists of Phe-247, Phe-250, and Gly-254 on one face of a short α-helical segment in the periplasmic loop between helices VII and VIII (Sun et al., 1996). Treatment of RSO membrane vesicles with mAb 4B1 inhibits all reactions catalyzed by the permease that involve net H+ translocation with no effect on ligand binding and either equilibrium exchange or counterflow of substrate (Carrasco et al., 1982, 1984). The “uncoupling” effect of mAb 4B1 is remarkably similar to the effects of site-directed mutations in Glu-325 (helix X) (Carrasco et al., 5.Carrasco N. Antes L.M. Poonian M.S. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4486-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6.Carrasco N. Puttner I.B. Antes L.M. Lee J.A. Larigan J.D. Lolkema J.S. Roepe P.D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2533-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), as well as the functional alterations observed in vivo with mutants devoid of PE (Bogdanov and Dowhan, 1995) and in reconstituted proteoliposomes lacking PE (Page et al., 1988; Seto-Young et al., 20.Seto-Young D. Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 84: 256-267Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is particularly interesting that helix VIII contains Glu-269, a residue that is essential for transport and interacts with another essential residue, His-322 (helix X), while helix VII contains Asp-237 and Asp-240 which interact with Lys-358 (helix XI) and Lys-319 (helix X), respectively (Kaback et al., 1994). Since helices VII and VIII interact with helix X which contains Glu-325 and mAb 4B1 mimics the effect of mutations at this position, torsional effects on either of these helices may alter the pKa of one or more residues in helices VII and/or VIII in such a manner as to increase the pKa of Glu-325, thereby limiting deprotonation of the permease at the surface of the membrane (Carrasco et al., 1986, 1989; Sun et al., 1996). Bogdanov and Dowhan(1995) postulated that lactose permease in PE-deficient membranes is unable to release a H+ on the inner surface of the membrane. Binding of mAb 4B1 also markedly alters the reactivity of a site-specific Cys replacement of Val-331 (helix X), as well as the fluorescence of this mutant after labeling the Cys with 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (Sun et al., 1996). Taken together, the data are consistent with a role for PE in either the folding of helices VII and VIII or their packing within the bilayer. The observation that sufficient conformational memory remains in the permease after removal of PE and renaturation on a solid support to reform the 4B1 epitope indicates that PE does not act per se to maintain the conformation within L(VII/VIII). Rather, PE plays a role in the folding of either the epitope itself or helices VII and VIII which may determine the conformation of the epitope. Further support for this conclusion comes from the ability of PE to direct the formation of the epitope during renaturation from SDS of permease originally assembled in the absence of PE. Therefore, PE functions as do protein molecular chaperones in guiding the folding pathway which is a new and novel role for a phospholipid. What are the special properties of PE which may be related to its specific role in determining protein conformation? PE, unlike PC, has a strong tendency to form nonbilayer structures (Thurmond et al., 23.Thurmond R.L. Dodd S.W. Brown M.F. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 108-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and, with its small head group, PE may interact at the interface between phospholipid and protein domains or intercalate within the packed helical structure of membrane proteins; helix VIII contains a region of low information content that has been postulated to be in contact with phospholipids (Hinkle et al., 14.Hinkle P.C. Hinkle P.V. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10989-10994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PE (as well as PC) also exhibits a dipole moment over the ionic head group which can respond to membrane potential (Seelig, 19.Seelig J. Wirtz K.W.A. Parker L. Evangelopoulos J.Å. Changeues J.P. New Developments in Lipid-Protein Interactions and Receptor Functions. Plenum Press, London1993: 441-448Google Scholar). Positive charges have been postulated to interaction with π electrons of aromatic side chains of amino acids (Dougherty, 9.Dougherty D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar). Not only are two Phe residues part of the determinant recognized by mAb 4B1, but the sequence in the region of L(VII/VIII), which is conserved among several other secondary transporters (Frillingos et al., 12.Frillingos S. Sahin-Tóth M. Persson B. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8074-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), contains 6 Phe residues. Therefore, head group size and electrical properties of PE coupled with the ability to assume nonbilayer structures may combine to influence the final helix structure and packing of the permease and ultimately its function. In conclusion, the use of monoclonal antibodies in an Eastern-Western blot analysis of other membrane proteins may reveal additional examples of phospholipid-dependent organization of protein structure, especially for those proteins that require the addition of lipids to regain function. Direct assay of enzyme activity after transferring proteins to a solid support in an Eastern-Western blot may prove to be a useful screening technique to survey the role of specific lipids in protein function. The method described here could have broad application for the study of renaturation of proteins from SDS in the presence of either surface-bound ligands or ligands introduced into the electroblotting buffers. Certainly the realization that specific phospholipids can determine the folding pathway of a protein should be taken into account in designing experiments aimed at understanding the mechanism for assembling proteins into membranes. We thank Drs. Finn Wold and John DeMoss for their thoughtful comments. Phil Heacock was also very helpful by first finding references that described methods for applying lipids to nitrocellulose which was instrumental in developing the Eastern-Western blot procedure."

We studied the role of protein phosphorylation in the regulation of cardiac NCX1 using CCL39 stably overexpressing the canine cardiac NCX1 and rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. In both cell types, the NCX1 protein immunoprecipitated with a chicken anti-NCX1 antibody exhibited a significant basal phosphorylation that was further enhanced by treatment with endothelin-1, acidic fibroblast growth factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or okadaic acid. In contrast, calphostin C, K252a, or EGTA inhibited the phosphorylation. The phosphorylation occurred on two major tryptic phosphopeptides (P1 and P2) exclusively on serine residues. Evidence is presented suggesting that P2 was derived from an N-terminal half (amino acids 240-475) of the central cytoplasmic domain of NCX1 and was phosphorylated directly by protein kinase C (PKC). The agents that increased NCX1 phosphorylation significantly enhanced both the forward and reverse modes of Na+/Ca2+ exchange. This exchange activation exhibited a very good correlation with the NCX1 phosphorylation. In NCX1-transfected cells, PKC down-regulation following prolonged exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate abolished the acidic fibroblast growth factor-induced activation of exchange activity. On the other hand, cell ATP depletion reduced the exchange activity and abolished the effects of the above agents on exchange activity.

In cytosols prepared from hormone-free mammalian cells, steroid receptors exist in multiprotein complexes that contain hsp90, 1The abbreviations used are: hspheat shock proteinGRglucocorticoid receptorPRprogesterone receptorFKBPFK506 binding proteinCyP-40the 40 kDa cyclosporin A-binding proteinTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethane sulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. an immunophilin (either FKBP52/hsp56 or CyP-40), a 23-kDa acidic protein, p23, and, often, substoichiometric amounts of hsp70 (for review see Refs. 1Smith D.F.

This multiprotein receptor heterocomplex can be assembled under cell-free conditions by incubating immunoadsorbed, hormone-free receptors (preincubated with salt to strip them free of associated proteins) with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (3Smith D.F.

This heterocomplex assembly system is versatile in that reticulocyte lysate has been used to assemble heterocomplexes containing the oncogenic protein kinases Src or Raf with hsp90 and p50 (5Hutchison K.A.

The heterocomplex assembly system appears to be ubiquitous, in that concentrated lysates from other mammalian, insect, and even plant cells are able to assemble the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) into a complex with hsp90 (7Stancato L.F. Hutchison K.A. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The GR must be associated with hsp90 for it to bind steroid (8Bresnick E.H. Dalman F.C. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Over the past five years, several conditions required for steroid receptor·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly by reticulocyte lysate have been defined. Assembly is an ATP/Mg2+-dependent process that requires the presence of a monovalent cation, such as K+ or NH+4 (9Hutchison K.A. Czar M.J. Scherrer L.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14047-14053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1350-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inactivates the assembly process, and the activity is restored by purified hsp70 (11Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proving that hsp70 is required to form complexes with hsp90. p23, a conserved, widely distributed protein that is neither a heat shock protein nor an immunophilin (12Johnson J.L. Beito T.G. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), binds directly to hsp90 in an ATP-dependent manner (13Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and is required for assembly of a functional GR·hsp90 heterocomplex (14Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hutchison K.A. Stancato L.F. Owens-Grillo J.K. Johnson J.L. Krishna P. Toft D.O. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18841-18847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is thought that a 60-kDa protein of reticulocyte lysate is also required for heterocomplex assembly. This p60 was originally observed in reconstituted progesterone receptor complexes when ATP was limiting (10Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1350-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or at early stages of assembly (16Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). p60 is a protein that was identified by Honoré et al. (17Honoré B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be up-regulated by viral transformation, and it is a homolog of the nonessential yeast heat shock protein, Sti1 (18Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3638-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It is established that p60, hsp90, and hsp70 interact with each other (19Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and they are thought to act in a cooperative manner in receptor heterocomplex assembly. The immune adsorption of hsp90 from reticulocyte lysate and other cell extracts copurifies several proteins, including hsp70, p60, p23, and the immunophilins FKBP52/hsp56 (also called p59) and CyP-40 (19Smith D.F.

The immunoadsorbed hsp90 with its coimmunoadsorbed proteins contains all the components of reticulocyte lysate required to reassociate the GR with hsp90 and to restore the receptor to its steroid binding state (22Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunophilin components of this foldosome machinery are not required for GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly (23Owens-Grillo J.K. Hoffmann K. Hutchison K.A. Yem A.W. Deibel M.R. Handschumacher R.E. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20479-20484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but a loosely associated component that is easily washed away is required to form a functional (i.e. steroid binding) GR·hsp90 complex (22Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This weakly bound component has been identified as p23 (15Hutchison K.A. Stancato L.F. Owens-Grillo J.K. Johnson J.L. Krishna P. Toft D.O. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18841-18847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is thought that the core complex for receptor heterocomplex assembly may be the hsp90·p60·hsp70 unit and that p60 dissociates after hsp70 and hsp90 bind to the receptor, with p23 becoming tightly bound to the receptor heterocomplex at that time. To define the mechanism of heterocomplex assembly in greater detail, the system must first be reconstituted from purified components. In this work, we have separated rabbit reticulocyte lysate into three fractions that contain the four identified components of the heterocomplex assembly system. When the fraction containing hsp70 and p60 is reconstituted with two other fractions containing hsp90 and p23, respectively, the heterocomplex assembly activity of reticulocyte lysate is reconstituted. Substitution of the reticulocyte lysate fractions with purified rabbit hsp90 and hsp70 and bacterially expressed human p23 and p60 yields a system that assembles a GR·hsp90 complex with steroid binding activity. Although it is likely that other proteins (e.g. rDnaJ, p48) are required for optimal heterocomplex assembly in intact cells, this work identifies a minimal system for receptor heterocomplex assembly under cell-free conditions. [6,7-3H]Triamcinolone acetonide (42.8 Ci/mmol) and 125I-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs were obtained from DuPont NEN. Untreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI). Protein A-Sepharose, Sepharose CL-6B, and goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugates were from Sigma. Phenyl-Sepharose was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The rabbit antiserum against hsp70 and hsp90 (24Erhart J.C. Duthu A. Ullrich S. Appella E. May P.

Gary Perdew (Pennsylvania State University) and Karen Leach (The Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Michigan), respectively. Rabbit antiserum (anti-YDJ1) against the yeast DnaJ protein (27Caplan A.J. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) also recognizes rabbit DnaJ (rDnaJ) and was kindly provided by Dr. Avrom Caplan (Mount Sinai Medical Center). Prior to immunoadsorption, the BuGR antibody was prebound to protein A-Sepharose pellets by incubating 40 µl of a 20% slurry of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C with 40 µl of antibody at a concentration of 100 µg/ml and 150 µl of TEG buffer (10 mM TES, 50 mM NaCl, 4 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.6), followed by centrifugation and washing with TEG. Glucocorticoid receptors were immunoadsorbed from 250-300-µl aliquots of L cell cytosol (11Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by rotation for 2 h at 4°C with 8 µl of protein A-Sepharose prebound with BuGR antibody. Prior to incubation with reticulocyte lysate, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet an additional 2 h at 4°C with 0.5 M NaCl followed by one wash with 1 ml TEG and a second wash with 1 ml of HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). BuGR immune pellets (8 µl of protein A-Sepharose) containing GR stripped of hsp90 were incubated with 50 µl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, with combinations of purified proteins, or with fractions A-C of reticulocyte lysate (each at 10 µl) and adjusted to 50 µl with HKD buffer (10 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.35). Dithiothreitol (1 µl) was added to each incubation to a final concentration of 5 mM, and 5 µl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mM ATP, 250 mM creatine phosphate, 20 mM MgOAc and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) were added to all assays to yield a final assay volume of 56 µl. The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30°C with resuspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 5 min. At the end of the incubation, one-fourth of the suspension was removed for assay of steroid binding as described previously (9Hutchison K.A. Czar M.J. Scherrer L.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14047-14053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the remainder was used for Western blotting of receptor and associated proteins. The portion of the immunopellet used for steroid binding assay was washed one time with 1 ml of iced TEGM (TEG buffer plus 20 mM sodium molybdate), whereas the portion used for Western blotting was washed four times with 1 ml of TEGM. As noted previously (9Hutchison K.A. Czar M.J. Scherrer L.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14047-14053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 100 µl of L cell cytosol contains ~60,000 cpm of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide binding capacity, and with 1 µg of BuGR/100 µl of L cell cytosol (the binding conditions employed here), we immunoadsorb about 50% of the glucocorticoid receptor. Thus, ~30,000 cpm represents 100% of receptors reactivated to the steroid binding form. For assay of GR and associated proteins, immune pellets were boiled in SDS sample buffer with 10%β-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were resolved on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12% for resolving p23) as described previously (22Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and probed with 2 µg/ml BuGR monoclonal antibody for the glucocorticoid receptor, 0.05% rabbit antiserum for hsp70 and hsp90, 0.1% F5 anti-p60 mouse ascites for p60, 0.1% UPJ56 rabbit antiserum for FKBP52/hsp56, 0.1% anti-CyP-40 antiserum for CyP-40, 0.1% anti-YDJ1 antiserum for rDnaJ, and 0.1% JJ3 mouse ascites for p23. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-labeled or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counterantibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (25 ml) was adsorbed to a 2.5 × 20-cm column of DE52 equilibrated with HE buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.35), the column was washed with 150 ml of HE buffer with 20 mM sodium molybdate followed by 150 ml of HE buffer alone, and the proteins were eluted with a 400-ml gradient of 0-0.5 M KCl. hsp90, hsp70, p60, FKBP52/hsp56, CyP-40, and p23 were detected by resolving an aliquot of each fraction by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with appropriate antibodies. Fractions were combined in three pools designated A-C (see Fig. 1). Pooled fractions were dialyzed against HKD buffer, concentrated to 1 ml (1/25 the original volume of lysate), and flash-frozen in small aliquots. ATP-agarose-treated lysate, which does not contain hsp70, was made as described previously (11Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial expression of human p23 and its purification have been described (14Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, p23 is soluble in bacterial lysates, and its abundance and high affinity for DEAE-cellulose allowed purification to 90% purity by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The protein was concentrated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 80% of saturation. It was dissolved and dialyzed into 10 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.4 and stored at −70°. Rabbit p23 was purified by adding solid ammonium sulfate to fraction pool C (see Fig. 1) from DE52 chromotography of rabbit reticulocyte lysate to achieve a final concentration of 1.5 M. After centrifugation, the p23-containing supernatant was applied to a small column containing 5 ml of phenyl-Sepharose, which was washed with 50 ml of 1.5 M ammonium sulfate in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The column was then eluted with 150 ml of a descending gradient of 1.5-0 M ammonium sulfate in phosphate buffer. Fractions containing p23 were identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with JJ3 antibody. p23-containing fractions were pooled, contracted to 1 ml, dialyzed against HKD buffer, flash frozen, and stored at −70°C. hsp70 was purified from the DE52 fraction pool A of rabbit reticulocyte lysate by chromatography on ATP-agarose and elution with ATP followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation exactly as described previously (11Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). hsp90 was purified from the DE52 fraction pool B of either rabbit reticulocyte lysate or rabbit brain cytosol by chromatography on hydroxylapatite followed by chromatography over ATP-agarose exactly as described in Hutchison et al. (11Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After removal of hsp70 by ATP-agarose, the hsp90-containing drop-through fractions were pooled, contracted to 1.0 ml, dialyzed against HKD buffer, flash frozen, and stored at −70°C. For bacterial lysates containing p60, cDNA for the 60-kDa human protein (IEF SSP 3521) cloned by Honoré et al. (17Honoré B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is the homolog of the rabbit p60 (19Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), was subcloned into a pET 23C vector (Novagen) using the EcoRI and NotI sites. 2W. P. Sullivan and D. O. Toft, unpublished observations. This construct was used to transform (Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3), which harbors an integrated T7 polymerase gene. Control E. coli and bacteria expressing p60 (kindly provided by Dr. David Smith) were grown to an A600 of 0.6, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 25°C, and harvested. Bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline, and aliquots were flash frozen and stored at −70°C. The elution of hsp90 and its associated proteins from a DE52 column is shown in Fig. 1. Fractions were combined into three pools designated A, B, and C, as indicated by the brackets shown under the Western blots of the individual proteins. The distribution of proteins in DE52 fraction pools A-C are shown in Fig. 2A, and the ability of each pool and combination of pools to assemble GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes is shown in Fig. 2B. When the stripped GR (lane 1) was incubated with DE52 pool A, B, or C (lanes 3, 4, and 5, respectively), there was no heterocomplex assembly, and very little assembly was seen with combinations of two fractions (lanes 6-8). However, when the stripped GR immune pellet was incubated with the combination of DE52 pools A, B, and C (lane 9), there was substantial GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly, comparable with the unfractionated lysate control in lane 2. It should be mentioned that immunoblots of larger volumes of the DE52 pools than that analyzed in Fig. 2A show that pool B always contains some hsp70 and trace amounts of p23, although as shown in Fig. 2A, the great majority of each of these proteins segregates to pools A and C, respectively. Also, DE52 pool C contains small amounts of hsp90. To determine the components of DE52 pool A required for reconstitution of GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly, we first asked whether the activity of pool A could be replaced by hsp70. As shown in Fig. 3A, removal of hsp70 by passing reticulocyte lysate through ATP-agarose inactivates heterocomplex assembly activity (cf. lane 3 with lane 2). The addition of the ATP-agarose-retained material (lane 5) or purified rabbit hsp70 (lane 4) restores the heterocomplex assembly activity. We have demonstrated previously that the hsp70 is purified to near homogeneity and that neither the purified hsp70 nor the ATP-agarose-retained fraction of lysate have any heterocomplex assembly activity when present alone (11Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig. 3B, the addition of purified hsp70 to the the combination of DE52 pools B and C (lane 9) produced a small increment in activity over that seen with the combination of B and C alone (lane 8), whereas addition of DE52 pool A to the combination of B and C (lane 6) yielded nearly the same heterocomplex assembly activity as unfractionated lysate (lane 2). Because the addition of larger amounts of purified hsp70 to the combination of B and C does not yield any greater activation than that seen in lane 9 (data not shown), it seems likely that another component (or components) of DE52 pool A is required for heterocomplex assembly. A likely candidate for this additional factor is p60, and we wanted to determine the effect of p60 depletion on the activity of pool A. To facilitate depletion, selected DE52 fractions were combined such that fractions from the half of pool A containing the majority of p60 were in one subfraction designated A1, and selected fractions from the other half of pool A containing a minority of p60 were in a subfraction designated A2. Half of A1 and A2 was extracted with nonimmune antibody, and the other half of A2 was extracted with protein A-Sepharose prebound with F5 antibody to extract the remaining p60. The distributions of selected proteins in the subfractions of pool A are shown in Fig. 4A, where it can be seen that the amount of p60 in A2 is low relative to A1 and p60 is eliminated from A2 by immunoextraction with F5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, the combination of subfraction A1 with B and C (lane 9) yields the same GR heterocomplex assembly as unfractionated reticulocyte lysate (lane 2), whereas subfraction A2 is less active (lane 10) and F5-extracted A2 (lane 11) has only a low activity comparable with that of hsp70 alone added to B and C (Fig. 3, lane 9). The experiment of Fig. 5 was performed to determine if bacterially expressed human p60 would restore heterocomplex assembly activity to the p60-depleted DE52 A2 subfraction of reticulocyte lysate. Fig. 5A shows the presence of p60 by Coomassie Blue staining (lane 2) and Western blotting (lane 4) in lysate of E. coli expressing p60 versus control bacterial lysate (lanes 1 and 3). In Fig. 5B, stripped receptors (lane 1) were incubated with various fractions of reticulocyte lysate and bacterial lysates. Neither the A2 subfraction alone (lane 3) nor the combined DE52 pools B and C (lane 4) had heterocomplex assembly activity, but the combination of A2, B, and C (lane 5) resulted in substantial activity. The combination of B and C with F5-extracted (p60-depleted) A2 yielded only a small amount of heterocomplex assembly (lane 6), and the addition of control bacterial lysate to the mixture was without effect (lane 7). However, addition of extract from p60-expressing bacteria to the mixture yielded a concentration-dependent increase in heterocomplex assembly (lanes 8-10). Fig. 6 shows that the receptor activating activity of the DE52 pool A of reticulocyte lysate can be replaced by the combination of highly purified rabbit hsp70 and lysate from p60-expressing E. coli. It can be seen that purified hsp70 alone (lane 6), bacterial lysate containing p60 alone (lane 7), and the combination of hsp70 and p60 (lane 8) were inactive at heterocomplex assembly. Also, the addition of either p60 alone (lane 9) or hsp70 alone (lane 10) to the combination of DE52 pools B and C was without effect. However, the addition of both purified rabbit hsp70 and bacterial lysate containing human p60 to the combined DE52 pools B and C (lane 11) yielded steroid binding activity that was close to that achieved with the combination of DE52 pools A, B, and C (lane 5). In the experiment shown in Fig. 7, DE52 pool B was substituted with purified rabbit hsp90. It can be seen in Fig. 7B that purified hsp90 does not bind to the GR or activate steroid binding activity when incubated alone with stripped receptors (lane 6). However, in the presence of DE52 pools A and C, which together yield only a small amount of heterocomplex reconstitution (lane 4), the addition of purified hsp90 (lane 7) yields GR·hsp90 complex formation and steroid binding activity comparable with that achieved with the combination of DE52 pools A, B, and C (lane 5). The addition of purified hsp90 to pool A alone does not yield steroid binding activity (lane 9). Fig. 8 shows that the activity of DE52 pool C can be replaced with purified p23. In preliminary experiments (data not shown) we found that rabbit p23 purified from the DE52 pool C of reticulocyte lysate could substitute for the activity of pool C in the recombined system. As shown in Fig. 8A, purified human p23 (shown in Fig. 8B, lane 1), which does not itself activate steroid binding activity (lane 6) produces a concentration-dependent activation when added to the combination of rabbit reticulocyte lysate DE52 pools A and B (lane 7-10). Fig. 8C shows that the incubation of GR with purified p23 and lysate pools A and B (lane 7) yields more GR·hsp90 heterocomplex (see Western blot) than pools A and B without p23 (lane 4), with both steroid binding activity and heterocomplex formation being equivalent to that achieved with the combination of DE52 pools A, B, and C (lane 5). To optimize the concentrations of the various components of the assembly system, concentration curves like that shown for p23 in Fig. 8A were performed for p60 (Fig. 9A), hsp70 (Fig. 9B), and hsp90 (Fig. 9C). The heterocomplex assembly system was then reconstituted in the experiment of Fig. 10, utilizing the optimal concentrations of components determined in Figs. 8A and 9. As shown in lanes 3-5 of Fig. 10, GR incubated with p60 and p70 (lane 3) or with purified hsp90 (lane 4) or with p23 (lane 5) are not converted to the steroid binding conformation. Incubation of receptors with p60, hsp70, and hsp90 (lane 7) or with p23 and hsp90 (lane 9) results in little GR·hsp90 heterocomplex formation and steroid binding activity. But the combination of all four components (lane 9) results in nearly the same level of heterocomplex formation and steroid binding activity as was obtained with unfractionated reticulocyte lysate (lane 2). The components of the rabbit reticulocyte receptor·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system were identified by analyzing the proteins that were bound to the chicken progesterone receptor (PR) at early and late stages of assembly of the PR·hsp90 heterocomplex (10Smith D.F.

Although there is evidence that hsp70, p60, and p23 are each required for PR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly (10Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1350-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Smith D.F.

Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), the proteins have not previously been reconstituted into a receptor·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system. Herein, we have divided rabbit reticulocyte lysate into three DE52 fraction pools (Fig. 1), each of which must be present in the incubation mixture for substantial assembly of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes and reactivation of steroid binding activity (Fig. 2). The ability of DE52 fraction pool A to activate the steroid binding activity of the mouse GR was replaced with purified rabbit hsp70 and bacterial lysate containing human p60 (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6), and pools B and C were replaced with purified rabbit hsp90 and purified human p23, respectively (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). When these four preparations are combined, the mixture assembles GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes and restores the receptors to the steroid binding conformation (Fig. 10). Reconstitution of the system with these p60, hsp70, hsp90, and p23 preparations does not establish that these are the only proteins required for receptor·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly. The Smith laboratory has shown that a 48-kDa protein of reticulocyte lysate is recovered with PR·hsp90 complexes at early times of assembly (16Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) or when assembly is blocked at an intermediate stage by geldanamycin (28Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), an hsp90-binding benzoquinone ansamycin (29Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). This 48-kDa protein appears to be the same as Hip, the hsc70-interacting protein identified by Hohfeld et al. (30Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and it could be present as a contaminant in the purified rabbit hsp70 and/or hsp90. Whether Hip is required for GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly or whether it facilitates assembly has not yet been determined. It is known that mammalian cells contain homologs of the bacterial DnaJ (31Ohtsuka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The DnaJ homolog Ydj1 has been found in GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes from yeast, and genetic experiments show that Ydj1 is required for the GR to be hormone-responsive in yeast (32Kimura Y. Yahara I. Lindquist S. Nature. 1995; 268: 1362-1365Google Scholar). DnaJ homologs could also be present as contaminants in our purified rabbit hsp70 and/or hsp90 preparations and might facilitate assembly. Two FK506-binding immunophilins, FKBP52 and p54, as well as a cyclosporin A-binding immunophilin, CyP-40, are present in receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes reconstituted with reticulocyte lysate (33Hutchison K.A.

We established by immunoblotting (data not shown) that the purified preparations of hsp70, hsp90, and p23 used in our reconstitution of the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system do not contain any of these mammalian immunophilins. These immunophilins all have peptidylprolyl isomerase activity (36Walsh C.T. Zydowsky L.D. McKeon F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13115-13118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but that activity does not seem to be required for GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly. Reticulocyte lysate also assembles the oncogenic protein kinases Src and Raf into heterocomplexes that contain hsp90 and a 50-kDa protein, p50 (5Hutchison K.A. Brott B.K. DeLeon J.H. Perdew G.H.

We have also demonstrated by immunoblotting (data not shown) that p50 is not present in the purified proteins we have used for GR·hsp90 heterocomplex reconstitution. Thus, like the immunophilins, it is not required for heterocomplex assembly. This work presents the first demonstration of p60 activity in a biochemical assay and the first reconstitution of the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system. The availability of a reconstituted system should greatly facilitate study of the mechanism of the assembly process.

https://openalex.org/W2039511300,"Survival or destruction of a pathogen following phagocytosis depends, in part, on fusion events between the phagosome and the endosomal or lysosomal compartments. Here we use an in vitro assay to show that phagosome-endosome fusion is regulated by the small GTPase rab5 and that fusion events are influenced by an internalized live organism, Listeria monocytogenes (LM). We compare the in vitro fusion of phagosomes containing heat-killed organisms (dead LM) with that of phagosomes containing a live nonhemolytic mutant (live LMhly−). Unlike the wild-type organism, LMhly− remains trapped inside the phagosome. Phagosome-endosome fusion was reconstituted using biotinylated organisms and endosomes containing horseradish peroxidase conjugated with avidin. With both live LMhly− and dead LM preparations, in vitro phagosome-endosome fusion was time-, temperature-, and cytosol-dependent. Live LMhly− phagosomes exhibited a faster rate of fusion. Fusion in both preparations was regulated by rab5 and possibly by other GTPases. Anti-rab5 antibodies and immunodepletion of cytosolic rab5 inhibited fusion. Addition of glutatione S-transferase-rab5 in the GTP form stimulated phagosome-endosome fusion, whereas addition of a dominant negative mutant of rab5 blocked fusion. Purified live LMhly− phagosomal membranes were enriched in rab5 as revealed by Western blotting, compared with dead LM phagosomes. Fusion of endosomes with dead LM containing phagosomes required ATP and was inhibited by ATP depletion and by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and anti-NEM-sensitive factor (NSF) antibodies. Unexpectedly, phagosome-endosome fusion with live LMhly−-containing phagosomes was not inhibited by ATP depletion nor by NEM or anti-NSF antibodies. Western blot analysis revealed that live LMhly−-containing phagosomes were enriched for membrane-bound NSF, while dead LM containing phagosomes contained low or undetectable quantities. Washing live LMhly−-containing phagosomes with 0.5 M KCl removed NSF associated with the membranes and rendered them NEM, ATP, anti-NSF antibody sensitive for fusion. We conclude that rab5 regulates phagosome-endosome fusion and that live microorganisms can up-regulate this process by recruiting rab5 to the membrane.

We conclude that rab5 regulates phagosome-endosome fusion and that live microorganisms can up-regulate this process by recruiting rab5 to the membrane. Phagocytosis, an important element of the host-defense system, is initiated by the attachment of a particle or organism to the phagocyte via cell surface receptors followed by ingestion and formation of a phagosome. Subsequently, a series of sequential intracellular membrane fusion and budding events occur that accommodate maturation of the phagosome and the delivery of hydrolytic enzymes and other molecules important for host defense. Proper orchestration of these events is thought to lead to the destruction of the pathogen and to the initiation of appropriate immunological responses.

After internalization, phagosomes containing LM are thought to fuse with lysosomes to form phagolysosomes (7Bouvier G. Benoiel A.M. Foa C. Bongrand P. J.

Studies with heat-killed LM (dead LM) indicate that phagosomes receive material from the trans-Golgi network and from lysosomes (10Harding C.V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Studies with Staphylococcus aureus phagosomes have rendered similar conclusions (12Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Schwartz A.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 126-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Virulent LM has been shown to lyse the phagolysosomal membrane and to escape into the cytoplasm where growth flourishes. Escape from the phagosome is mediated by listeriolysin O (also known as hemolysin). Listeriolysin O-defective mutants, i.e. nonhemolytic mutants (LMhly−) (13Portnoy D.A. Jacks P.S. Hinrichs D. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 14Cossart P. Vicente M.F. Mengaud J. Baquero F. Perez-Diaz J.C. Berche P. Infect.

Immun. 1994; 62: 5608-5613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are unable to escape from the phagolysosome and are degraded by the phagocyte. In this respect, LMhly− mutants behave as heat-killed bacteria (dead LM). Our goal was to analyze early phagosome-endosome fusion events with LM containing phagosomes using an in vitro fusion assay, where the role of different factors and the influence of the live microorganism could be examined. Over the past few years, there has been a substantial increase in our knowledge of vesicle budding and membrane fusion events along the endocytic pathway and the role of GTP-binding proteins as regulators of these processes (16Mayorga L.S. Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Goud B. McCaffrey M. Curr. Opin.

The GTPase rab5 plays a central role in early endocytic events. Although rab5 was found to be present on phagosomes isolated following phagocytosis of latex beads (21Desjardins M. Huber H. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), a functional role for rab5 in phagocytosis has not yet been described. Here, we show that in vitro fusion of phagosomes, containing both live and dead bacteria, with endosomes is regulated by rab5. Both fusion events require cytosolic proteins. However, the ATP requirement and the sensitivity of fusion to NEM are quite different for phagosomes containing live and dead organisms. These differences lead us to postulate that rab5-regulated early phagosome fusion is dependent on the status of the microorganism. Moreover, the data indicate that live L. monocytogenes directly affects and modulates the fusion process by recruiting rab5 to the phagosomal membranes. J774E clone, a mannose receptor-positive macrophage cell line, was grown as described previously (12Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Schwartz A.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Recombinant rab5 proteins were expressed in large quantity as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli strain JM 101 and were affinity-purified by glutathione-Sepharose resin (GST-rab5). Before prenylation, rab-geranylgeranyl transferase (REP-1) was partially purified following a protocol previously reported (29Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Briefly, rab5 substrate (10 µM) was incubated with the REP-1 in 50 µl of 50 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM Nonidet-P40, 1 mM DTT (buffer A) containing 12 µM geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) for 30 min at 37°C. After the reaction, the prenylated rab5 proteins were aliquoted at 4 mg/ml and stored at −80°C. Under these conditions, 70% of the rab5 was prenylated as measured by the incorporation of [3H]GGPP. Rab5 copurifies with rab escort protein as described by Andres et al. (33Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P. Goldstein S.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Rab escort protein has been shown to mediate rab5 binding to endosomal membranes (34Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Solubility of the purified proteins was checked as follows. Recombinant purified proteins (1 µg) were resuspended in 200 µl of the following solutions: (a) buffer B (50 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT); (b) buffer B containing 1 mM Nonident P-40; and (c) buffer B containing 0.1% BSA. The solubility of rab5 proteins was evaluated by the presence of a visible aggregate after 40 min at 37°C incubation under each of the conditions described above. Aggregates were found where the protein was resuspended in buffer B without detergent or BSA. Purified protein stocks contained 1-3% BSA, which resulted in a relatively small amount of BSA in our fusion reactions (less than 100 µmol of BSA/mol of prenylated rab5). BSA may affect the solubility and the appropriate targetting of prenylated rabs in the absence of appropriate escort proteins (35Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15427-15430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nonhemolytic L. monocytogenes mutant strain used in this study (DP-L2161) (LMhly−) (15Jones S. Portnoy D.A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5608-5613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) derived from the wild-type strain (10403S) was kindly provided by D. A. Portnoy (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The bacteria were grown in brain-heart infusion broth (Difco) at 37°C with aeration in the presence of 150 µg/ml streptomycin. The bacteria were harvested in the logarithmic phase of growth and were heat-killed by treatment at 60°C for 1 h. Heat-killed bacteria (dead LM) were confirmed dead by plating in blood agar plates. Bacteria were extensively washed and stored at 4°C. LMhly− and dead LM (109 bacteria) were biotinylated with ss-NHS-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and as described previously (36Kocks C. Gouin E. Tabouret M. Berche P. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Cell. 1992; 68: 521-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were washed three times in PBS (pH 7.4) and resuspended in PBS (pH 8.0) at 4°C. The bacteria were treated with ss-NHS-biotin at 0.5 mg/ml for 2 min with gentle shaking. They were washed sequentially in PBS, 50 mM NH4Cl, PBS, 0.1 mM CaCl2, PBS, 1 mM MgCl2 to quench free biotin, and resuspended in PBS. Biotinylation did not affect bacteria viability as determined by plating in blood agar plates. The number of biotin molecules per organism was estimated in every experiment using a colorimetric assay with the dye 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene)benzoic acid (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. While the numbers vary from experiment to experiment, routinely ~40 mol of ss-NHS-biotin/109 bacteria were incorporated, and no significant differences were found between dead and live LM. ss-NHS-biotin/dead LM were stored at 4°C and ss-NHS-biotin/live LMhly− were stored at −70°C until use. To identify biotinylated bacterial proteins, 109 biotinylated bacteria were extracted (36Kocks C. Gouin E. Tabouret M. Berche P. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Cell. 1992; 68: 521-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) by resuspension in 100 µl of PBS containing 1% SDS. Following centrifugation, SDS-PAGE, and transfer to nitrocellulose, blotting with avidin-HRP indicated that multiple proteins in both preparations of bacteria were biotinylated. The blots were essentially identical for the two preparations. The assay was performed essentially as previously reported (37Ziegler K. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1869-1875PubMed Google Scholar, 38Cluff C.W. Garcia M. Ziegler H.K. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3601-3612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LMhly− bacteria were grown overnight in brain-heart infusion broth. After extensive washing, bacteria were resuspended in RPMI (minus methionine and cysteine) with 1 mCi of [35S]methionine (ICN Tran35S-label). The bacteria were incubated with rotation for 6 h, washed with cold PBS, and resuspended in PBS. 35S-Labeled dead LM were prepared by heating as described above. Labeled bacteria incorporated 1-2 cpm/bacterium. Dead LM were also surface-labeled with 125I by the chloramine T method at 4°C (37Ziegler K. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1869-1875PubMed Google Scholar). For uptake assays, live 35S-labeled LMhly− and 125I- or 35S-labeled dead LM were added (3 × 105 cpm/well) to 2 × 106 cells (E-clone) in 24-well plates and centrifuged (2,000 rpm, 5 min, 4°C) to speed adherence and to synchronize the infection. Following incubation at 37°C for different times, cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. Experiments were performed in duplicate. J774E clone macrophages (108 cells) were incubated with ss-NHS-biotin/dead-LM or ss-NHS-biotin/live LMhly− (109 bacteria) (1 h, 4°C) and centrifuged to synchronize the infection (2,000 rpm, 5 min, 4°C). Uptake was initiated by addition of prewarmed HBSA (Hank's balanced salt solution buffered with 10 mM HEPES and 10 mM TES, pH 7.4, and supplemented with 1% BSA). After 10 min at 37°C, uptake was stopped by addition of ice-cold HBSA. Cells were sequentially washed with HBSA, PBS-EDTA, and HBE (250 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA, 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2) by centrifugation (300 × g for 4 min). Cells were resuspended with HBE (2 × 108 cells/ml) and homogenized in a ball bearing homogenizer (12Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Schwartz A.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 126-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged at 400 × g for 3 min to eliminate nuclei and intact cells. The postnuclear supernatants (PNS) were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Phagosomal fractions were obtained by diluting a quickly thawed PNS aliquot in 1 ml of HBE and centrifuging at 12,000 × g in a Microfuge for 10 s at 4°C, as previously reported (12Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Schwartz A.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 126-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Mayorga L.S. Bertini F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Invest. 1992; 90: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The supernatant was kept at 4°C and the pellet resuspended with HBE and centrifuged again. The resulting supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 6 min at 4°C. This pellet (phagosomal fraction) containing 70% of the total phagosomes in the sample was used for in vitro fusion assay. Early endosomes containing HRP-avidin conjugate were prepared as described previously with several modifications (41Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). J774E clone (108 cells) was incubated with HRP-avidin (200 µg/ml) for 1 h at 4°C. Under these conditions, HRP-avidin is essentially endocytosed via the mannose receptor (42Lang T. de Chastellier C. Biol. Cell. 1985; 53: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Uptake was initiated by the addition of prewarmed medium (1 ml) at 37°C and, after 10 min, terminated by adding ice-cold medium. Cells were washed and homogenized, and the PNS fraction was quickly frozen. To prepare endosomes, a thawed PNS (200 µl) was diluted up to 3 ml with HBE and pelleted for 1 min at 37,000 × g at 4°C. The supernatant was centrifuged for 5 min at 50,000 × g at 4°C. The pellet of the second centrifugation, enriched in 10-min endosomes (endosomal fraction) was used for in vitro fusion assays. The HRP-avidin was contained within intact vesicles by the criterion that greater than 90% of the HRP activity was sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Phagosomal fractions containing biotinylated dead LM or biotinylated live LMhly− and endosomal fractions containing HRP-avidin were mixed in fusion buffer (250 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA, 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, including an ATP-regenerating system, 1 mM ATP, 8 mM creatine phosphate, 31 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 0.25 mg/ml avidin as scavenger) supplemented with gel-filtered cytosol. After incubation for 60 min at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by chilling on ice. The HRP-avidin/biotin-bacteria complexes were recovered by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 6 min, at 4°C) after solubilization of membranes with solubilization buffer (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 containing 0.25 mg/ml avidin as scavenger). The enzymatic activity of HRP-avidin associated with the bacteria was then measured. The fusion activity was quantified as absorbance units/mg of protein (the HRP assay described below). Protein concentrations were determined in each experiment for all samples. Two controls were included in each experiment corresponding to (a) total activity and (b) background activity. Total activity is that which is particle associated when endosomes and phagosomes are mixed and then lysed with detergent. Total activity corresponds to the total fusion activity that could be achieved per experiment. Values around 480 absorbance units/mg were routinely recorded for both dead and live LM preparations. Background activity corresponds to particle-associated HRP when endocytic and phagocytic vesicles were mixed in fusion buffer lacking cytosolic proteins. These values were quite low and were subtracted from all other values. For measuring the fusion activity, each sample is compared to the fusion observed in the presence of complete fusion buffer containing the highest cytosol concentration which was normalized to a value of 1 after subtracting the background activity. The highest effective cytosol concentration was standarized for both fusion assays (with dead and live LM) and observed to be around 1 mg/ml for both assays. This fusion value corresponds to as much as 70% of the total activity depending on the experiment. The values obtained in each experiment are listed in table and figure legends. All reactions were incubated 60 min at 37°C. Antibodies (mAb 4F11 anti-rab5, anti-rab7, mAb 4A6 anti-NSF, mAb HDP-1 anti-DNP, and controls) were added at the concentration indicated and incubated for 45 min on ice before the fusion assay. For kinetic studies, samples were incubated for different times at 37°C and then cooled on ice. The protocol was essentially as previously reported (43Garret M.D. Zahner J.E. Cheney C.M. Novick P.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1718-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 44Soldati T. Rieder M.A. Pfeffer S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, phagocytic vesicles (100 µg) were preincubated in fusion buffer plus a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 20 µg/ml aprotinin) for 20 min at 30°C in the presence or absence of either GTPγS (1 mM) or GDP (1 mM). This incubation was followed by addition of 6 µg of purified GDI for 10 min at 30°C. Samples were washed twice in fusion buffer and resuspended either in sample buffer to be analyzed by SDS-PAGE or in fusion buffer and tested in a fusion reaction assay (the vesicles to be evaluated for fusion were pretreated with GDI in the presence of GDP). The enzyme assay was conducted in 96-well microplates (Costar Co.) using o-dianisidine as the chromogenic substrate (45Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was started by adding 20 µl of each sample to 100 µl of 0.5 N sodium acetate (pH 5.0) containing 0.342 mM o-dianisidine and 0.003% H2O2. The reaction was conducted at room temperature for 20 min and stopped by adding 100 µl of 0.1 N H2SO4. Absorbance was measured at A450 nm in a Bio-Rad microplate reader. Each value was expressed as absorbance units/mg of protein. For quantification, a standard curve with different concentrations of HRP-avidin was included in each experiment. J774E clone cells were grown to confluence on 35-mm tissue culture dishes. 5 × 107 dead or live LM were added per dish and centrifuged to synchronize the infection. Following 12 min of incubation at 37°C, unbound bacteria were washed out with PBS, 5 mM EDTA. Cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M Na-cacodylate buffer and prepared for electron microscopy as described previously (16Mayorga L.S. Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cryosection staining experiments, cells grown on 35-mm tissue culture dishes were incubated for 6 min with BSA-gold (10 nm), washed, and infected with dead or live LMhly− for 10 min, as described above. The cells were washed, scraped off, and fixed in suspension in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS, pH 7.2, for 2 h at room temperature. Tissue was embedded in 10% gelatin. After pelleting the tissue, the gelatin was solidified on ice. Blocks for ultracryotomy were prepared and immunolabeled as described by Slot et al. (46Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 10% goat serum was used in the blocking buffer in place of 1% BSA. Immunolabeling with primary antibody mAb 4F11 (anti-rab5) (65 µg/ml) was carried out overnight at 4°C. Incubation with secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs., West Grove, PA) 18 nm of goat anti-mouse IgG/gold (1:15) was carried out for 1 h. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and embedded in methyl cellulose according to a modification of the Tokuyasu method (47Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1980; 12: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 48Griffiths G. McDowall A. Back R. Dubochet J. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1984; 89: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). All electron microscopy specimens were viewed and photographed using a Zeiss 902 electron microscope. The phagosomal fractions described above were resuspended in HBE containing 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, and filtered through a 5-µm pore filter. The flow-through was loaded on top of a 12% sucrose cushion. Samples were centrifuged (1,700 rpm, 45 min, 4°C), and purified phagosomes were recovered in the last 100 µl at the bottom of the tube. This protocol is similar to one described pr"

Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar)). P-gp is an active transporter that utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pump cytotoxic drugs out of cells, reducing their intracellular concentrations and, hence, their toxicity. The P-gp molecule is composed of two halves, which share significant similarity to each other. Each half-molecule consists of a transmembrane domain, which participates in substrate binding and forms the pathway through which substrate crosses the membrane; and a nucleotide-binding domain, which couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport. Between the two halves of the molecule is a highly charged region, the “linker.” The linker appears to be the only region of P-gp that is phosphorylated, either in vivo or in vitro (Chambers et al., 9Chambers T.C.

However, all these studies are subject to alternative interpretations (see “Discussion”). In order to address the role of phosphorylation in a rigorous fashion, we mutated the phosphorylation sites such that P-gp could no longer be phosphorylated by PKC. Real-time measurement of drug transport following expression of the wild type and mutant P-gps in yeast and human cells showed that phosphorylation of the linker region has no significant effect on the rates of drug transport. Mutations introduced into the linker of the human MDR1 gene are shown in Fig. 1. Construction of mutant MDR1 genes that express P-gp8A and P-gp8E (the eight consensus serine/threonine residues mutated to alanine or glutamate, respectively) has been described previously (Hardy et al., 25Hardy S.P.

Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter as a 3.9-kilobase pair PvuII-XhoI fragment isolated from pMDR7S (Valverde et al., 47Valverde M.A. Diaz M. Sepulveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), generating plasmid pVTMDR. The mutant genes were introduced into pVTMDR as 2199-base pair EcoRI-PstI fragments to generate pVT737 (P-gp8A), pVT738 (P-gp8E), pVT739 (P-gp3A), and pVT740 (P-gp3E). These plasmids were then checked for introduction of the relevant mutations by DNA sequencing. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain SY1 (MATα, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, his4-619, sec6-4 GAL) was grown at 25°C on supplemented medium (0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.1 mM histidine, 0.2 mM leucine, 0.2 mM uracil) containing 2% glucose. Yeast strain SY1 carries a temperature-sensitive mutation and, at the restrictive temperature, accumulates secretory vesicles within the cytoplasm (Walworth and Novick, 51Walworth N.C. Novick P. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These vesicles are exclusively inside-out and of uniform size. Secretory vesicles were prepared and [3H]vinblastine (Amersham Corp.) accumulation measured as described (Ruetz and Gros, 40Ruetz S. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12277-12284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of valinomycin (20 µg/ml) on yeast growth was assessed by measurement of absorbance at 600 nm, using strain JPY201 transformed with each plasmid, grown at 30°C in YPD broth. GM0637 is an SV40-transformed lung fibroblast cell line expressing negligible levels of P-gp and was obtained from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund cell culture facility. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with derivatives of the expression plasmid pcDNA3 (InVitrogen Corp.). The MDR1 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3 as a 3.9-kilobase pair SmaI-XhoI fragment (nucleotides 425-4265 from pMDR7S (Valverde et al., 47Valverde M.A. Diaz M. Sepulveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) to give pcMDR, which expresses wild type P-gp. To construct an equivalent plasmid expressing P-gp8A, the 2199-base pair EcoRI-PstI fragment from pMDR737 (nucleotides 1601-3800) was cloned between the EcoRI-PstI sites of pcMDR to generate plasmid pcMDR737. These two plasmids were transfected into GM0637 cells grown to 50% confluence in 15-cm dishes. pcMDR or pcMDR737 DNA (30 µg) was mixed with DC-Chol lipid vesicles (150 µg) in 18 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) at room temperature for 10 min, added to the cells, and incubated for 3 h. Cells were washed once with PBS and then returned to normal media. When confluent, the cells were split 1:3 and replated in media containing Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) (400 µg/ml). Resistant colonies were allowed to reach confluence and then cultured sequentially in media containing increasing concentrations of vinblastine (10, 20, 40, 75, and 100 ng/ml). Cells transfected with pcMDR and pcMDR737 were designated GM.P-gp and GM.P-gp8A, respectively, and were maintained in media supplemented with vinblastine (100 ng/ml) and Geneticin (400 µg/ml). Transient expression of P-gp in S1 cells was carried out using the vaccinia-T7 hybrid expression system (Fuerst et al., 20Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The plasmids used were based on the wild type P-gp-expressing plasmid pMDR7, which has been described (Valverde et al., 47Valverde M.A. Diaz M. Sepulveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). pMDR712 is a derivative of pMDR7 in which Lys → Met changes have been introduced in the “Walker motif” of each of the nucleotide-binding domains. This mutant protein is severely impaired in its drug transport activity (Sardini et al., 42Sardini A. Mintenig G.M. Valverde M.A. Sepulveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. McNaughton P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3281-3290PubMed Google Scholar). pMDR737 and pMDR738 are derivatives of pMDR7, which express P-gp8A and P-gp8E, respectively. Cytotoxicity assays were based on published methods (Cano-Gauci and Riordan, 7Cano-Gauci D.F. Riordan J.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2115-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 24-well dishes at a density of 4 × 103 cells/well in 1 ml of DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. Drug was added at the indicated concentrations and cells grown until untreated cells reached confluence. Cell growth is expressed as a percentage relative to cells grown without drug. Verapamil, vinblastine, colchicine, and doxorubicin were from Sigma. Vinblastine accumulation by cell monolayers was measured as described previously (Callaghan and Riordan, 6Callaghan R. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16059-16064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells at 80-90% confluence in 60 × 15-mm tissue culture dishes were washed once with transport buffer (107 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 5.3 mM KCl, 1.9 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 7 mM glucose), and [3H]vinblastine (1 µCi; Amersham) added to a final concentration of 21.4 nM in 2 ml of transport buffer. Cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. Doxorubicin efflux from individual cells was measured by fluorescence confocal microscopy, as described previously (Sardini et al., 42Sardini A. Mintenig G.M. Valverde M.A. Sepulveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. McNaughton P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3281-3290PubMed Google Scholar). Calcein accumulation was measured in constantly stirred, detached cell suspensions (1 × 106 cells) in 1 ml of transport buffer (see above), as described previously (Homolya et al., 28Homolya L. Hollo Z. Germann U.A. Pastan P. Gottesman M.M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21493-21496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) was at 2.5 µM. Fluorescence was measured using a Shimadzu RF1001PC fluorimeter (37°C, λex 493 ± 1.5 nm; λem 515 ± 1.5 nm). Calcein fluorescence in individual cells was measured by epifluorescence confocal microscopy (Sardini et al., 42Sardini A. Mintenig G.M. Valverde M.A. Sepulveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. McNaughton P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3281-3290PubMed Google Scholar) with λex = 488 nm and λem > 515 nm. Fluorescence changes were detected as a function of time by collecting sequential images, usually at 20-s intervals, with the cells maintained in the presence of calcein-AM (2.5 µM). Cells were plated 48 h before experiments on coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine and were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS containing vinblastine (100 ng/ml) and Geneticin (400 µg/ml). Vinblastine was removed 24 h before coverslips were used. Experiments were performed at 37°C with a perfusion solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, 5.5 mMD-glucose, pH 7.3. Accumulation of calcein, measured by fluorescence increase, is directly related to the rate of transport by P-gp as follows. We define the influx of calcein-AM into the cell as I, and the concentrations of calcein-AM and its fluorescent product calcein to be [C-AM] and [C], respectively. Calcein-AM is either removed by transport from the cell, with rate constant α, or is hydrolyzed to calcein in the cytoplasm by endogenous esterases with rate constant β. Therefore, at equilibrium, I = α[C-AM] +β[C-AM] and Δ[C]/Δt = β[C-AM]. From these two equations, and with the assumption that α>β, the following relationship can be derived between the P-gp transport rate α and [C], which is proportional to cell fluorescence. α=Iβ/(d[C]/dt)(Eq.1) This argument is not changed if P-gp transports drug from the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer instead of from the cytoplasm (Higgins and Gottesman, 27Higgins C.F. Gottesman M.M. Trends Biol. Sci. 1992; 17: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar; Homolya et al., 28Homolya L. Hollo Z. Germann U.A. Pastan P. Gottesman M.M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21493-21496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), provided that partition of the drug between membrane and cytoplasm is rapid. The concentration of drug in the membrane, which determines the efflux rate by P-gp, is then a constant multiple of the concentration of drug in the cytoplasm, and the equations above are unchanged. Proteins were extracted from cell membranes in 2% SDS and protein quantified using the BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins was separated by electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Laemmli, 1972) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham) (Towbin et al., 45Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein was identified by probing with the monoclonal antibody C219 (1 µg in 10 ml) (Centocor Diagnostics) and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Anti-PKCα antibody was a kind gift of Peter Parker (Imperial Cancer Research Fund). Two monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the expression of P-gp: JSB1 (Boehringer Mannheim), which recognizes an internal epitope; and UIC2, which recognizes an external epitope. For JSB1, cells were fixed at −20°C for 4 min in methanol followed by 4 min in acetone. This treatment completely permeabilizes the cells, making the internal epitope accessible to the antibody. After three washes in PBS + 0.2% fish skin gelatin (Sigma), coverslips were incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature with antibody (5 µg/ml). For UIC2, cells were fixed in PBS plus 3% paraformaldehyde. The cell membrane is not permeabilized, and, on exposure to UIC2 (5 µg/ml), only surface membrane P-gp is detected. Cells were then washed three times with PBS + 0.2% fish skin gelatin. Antibody labeling was visualized by incubation with a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (5 µg/ml for 20 min at room temperature) raised against the specific class of primary antibody (anti-mouse IgG1 conjugated to Texas Red for JSB1, and anti-mouse IgG2a conjugated to rhodamine for UIC2; both from Euro-Path). After thorough washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted onto slides with anti-fading agent (Vectashield mounting medium H-1000) and images acquired using the confocal microscope. From confocal optical sections, it was verified that all UIC2 label was located on the surface membrane. Membranes were prepared as detailed by Cornwell et al. (16Cornwell M.M. Safa A.R. Felstead R.L. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 261: 7762-7770Google Scholar). The membranes were enriched for integral membrane proteins by sodium carbonate treatment as described by Fujiki et al. (21Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation of P-gp by PKC in membranes was as described (Chambers et al., 10Chambers T.C. Zheng B. Kuo J.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1008-1015PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (250 µg) in phosphorylation buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 25 mM sucrose, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 10 µM ATP, 100 µg/ml phosphatidylserine, 20 µg/ml 1,2-dioleolyl-sn-glycerol, 50 ng/ml calyculin A) and 10 µCi of [32P]orthophosphate (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) were incubated with PKC (0.1 unit) at 30°C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 × Laemmli buffer and proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylated proteins were detected and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). PKC (rat brain) was from Calbiochem. There are eight serine/threonine residues in the linker of P-gp that could, potentially, be phosphorylated (Fig. 1). However, it has been demonstrated that three of these, serines 661, 667, and 671, are the major sites of phosphorylation by PKC both in vivo and in vitro (Chambers et al., 11Chambers T.C. Pohl J. Raynor R.L. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4592-4595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chambers T.C. Pohl J. Glass D.B. Kuo J.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Chambers T.C. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Kuo J.F. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14156-14162Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change these three serine residues to alanines in order to prevent phosphorylation (P-gp3A). In a second mutant (P-gp3E), the serines were replaced by glutamate; this also prevents phosphorylation but, in addition, mimics the negative charge of phosphorylation. To exclude the possibility that secondary sites within the linker region might be phosphorylated when the primary sites were mutated, two additional mutations were generated in which all eight serine/threonine residues were changed, either to alanine (P-gp8A) or to glutamate (P-gp8E). The sequences of the linkers in these mutant proteins are presented in Fig. 1. Expression in yeast provides a convenient means of assessing the transport properties of mutant P-gps (Ruetz and Gros, 40Ruetz S. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12277-12284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast plasmids encoding the wild type or mutated P-gps (pVTU101, pVTMDR, pVT737, pVT738, pVT739, pVT740; see Fig. 1) expressed the respective proteins at identical levels, as assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). As expected, expression of wild type P-gp conferred resistance on yeast cells to 20 µg/ml valinomycin (Fig. 2B). The level of resistance conferred by the four mutant P-gps was indistinguishable from that of wild type P-gp. Thus, mutation of the phosphorylation sites had no effect on the ability of P-gp to confer valinomycin resistance on yeast. The rate of [3H]vinblastine transport by wild type and mutant P-gps was also assayed directly in yeast secretory vesicles (Fig. 2C). As expected, there was little [3H]vinblastine accumulation by vesicles isolated from cells transformed with the vector pVTU101 (14 ± 4 pmol/mg protein; reaching steady state after 1-2 min), while vinblastine was rapidly accumulated by vesicles isolated from cells expressing wild type P-gp (pVTMDR) (71 ± 9 pmol/mg protein; reaching a maximum after 4-5 min). The rate of drug transport by human P-gp expressed in yeast SVs was comparable to that determined previously for murine P-gp1A and P-gp1B (Ruetz and Gros, 40Ruetz S. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12277-12284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All four mutant P-gps confer rates of vinblastine uptake, and maximum levels of drug accumulation, indistinguishable from each other and from those of wild type P-gp (66-73 ± 14 pmol/mg protein). Verapamil (25 µM), a known blocker of P-gp function, abolished vinblastine uptake by the wild type and mutant P-gps. Thus, mutation of the phosphorylation sites of P-gp had no effect on its transport activity when expressed in yeast. To investigate the role of P-gp phosphorylation in human cells, a matched pair of cell lines was generated that express the wild type and P-gp8A proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). Western blotting and quantitation by densitometry showed that the two cell lines, GM.P-gp and GM.P-gp8A, express identical levels of wild type or mutant P-gp (Fig. 3A). The subcellular distribution of P-gp in the two cell lines was quantitated by fluorescence-linked immunocytochemistry. Two antibodies were used: UIC2, which binds to an external epitope; and JSB1, which binds to an internal epitope. In non-permeabilized cells, UIC2 assesses the amount of P-gp at the cell surface; in permeabilized cells, both JSB1 and UIC2 assess the total amount of P-gp. There was considerable heterogeneity of P-gp expression between individual cells (Fig. 3B) because the plasmids are maintained episomally and, consequently, the number of copies of the plasmid inherited by each daughter cell varies following cell division. However, the mean total fluorescence signals from large populations of individual permeabilized cells was similar for both cell lines. No significant difference in subcellular location of P-gp was detected between the two cell lines and the amount of P-gp in the cytoplasmic membrane, detected by UIC2 in non-permeabilized cells, was similar (Fig. 3B). Thus, phosphorylation of the linker of P-gp does not affect its subcellular localization or its trafficking to the plasma membrane. Previous studies have shown that the linker is the only site of P-gp phosphorylation (Chambers et al., 11Chambers T.C. Pohl J. Raynor R.L. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4592-4595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chambers T.C. Pohl J. Glass D.B. Kuo J.F. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25054-25062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the mutated protein was not phosphorylated in the linker, or elsewhere, membrane vesicles prepared from GM0637, GM.P-gp, and GM.P-gp8A cells were converted to sheets by carbonate treatment, and incubated with radiolabeled orthophosphate and purified PKC (Fig. 4). As expected, no phosphorylated P-gp was detected in membranes from the non-P-gp-expressing parental cells (GM0637), while P-gp from cells expressing wild type P-gp (GM.P-gp cells) was phosphorylated. Importantly, P-gp in membranes expressing the mutant P-gp (GM.P-gp8A cells) could not be phosphorylated, even though the amount of P-gp in the membranes was equivalent to that of the cell line expressing wild type P-gp (see Fig. 3). Autophosphorylation of PKC (the band at 82 kDa) and of other membrane proteins provides an internal control for the phosphorylation reaction. Thus, the mutant P-gp cannot be phosphorylated, either in the linker region or at alternative, secondary sites. It has been reported that expression of PKC may be increased in multidrug-resistant cells (Palyoor et al., 38Palyoor S.T. Vichi P. Tritton P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; Fine et al., 19Fine R.L. Patel J. Chabner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The levels of total PKC, and of the PKCα isoform that is believed to be responsible for P-gp phosphorylation (Yu et al., 52Yu G.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10313-10318Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), were unchanged following expression of the wild type mutant P-gp, as assessed by immunoblotting (data not shown). The cytotoxic effect of several different drugs was assayed for the three cell lines (Table I). The IC50 for vinblastine in untransfected GM0637 cells was 0.75 ng/ml. In GM.P-gp cells, expressing wild type P-gp, the IC50 for vinblastine was 318 ± 61 ng/ml (n = 3), a 425-fold increase in resistance. Cells transfected with the mutant P-gp8A (GM.P-gp8A cells) showed levels of resistance similar to those of wild type P-gp (IC50 = 283 ± 51 ng/ml; n = 3). The resistance to colchicine and doxorubicin conferred by wild type P-gp and P-gp8A was also indistinguishable (Table I). Thus, mutation of PKC phosphorylation sites in the linker region of P-gp has no effect on its ability to confer drug resistance or its drug resistance profile.Table IThe inhibitory effects of vinblastine, doxorubicin, and colchicine on growth of GM.P-gp and GM.P-gp8A cells expressed as IC50 values, the drug concentration at which growth is reduced to 50%Cell typeVinblastineDoxorubicinColchicineIC50Fold resistanceIC50Fold resistanceIC50Fold resistanceng/mlng/mlng/mlGM06370.75 ± 0.130.78 ± 0.20.21 ± 0.04GM.P-gp318 ± 61.2425196 ± 29.1252150.3 ± 11.5701GM.P-gp8A283 ± 51.3378164 ± 34.4211144.6 ± 11.2675 Open table in a new tab [3H]Vinblastine accumulation by cell monolayers was used as a direct assessment of P-gp transport activity. Vinblastine accumulation by the parental cells (GM0637), which do not express P-gp, was rapid, reaching a plateau of 40.5 nmol/µg protein after 60 min of incubation. In contrast, cells expressing wild type P-gp (GM.P-gp cells) or the mutant P-gp8A protein (GM.P-gp8A cells) showed identical, severely reduced rates of vinblastine accumulation (<2.5 nmol/µg protein). This reduced drug uptake for both cell lines was reversed by verapamil (50 µM). Doxorubicin efflux was measured by confocal fluorescence microscopy as described previously (Sardini et al., 42Sardini A. Mintenig G.M. Valverde M.A. Sepulveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F.

S1 cells were transiently transfected with wild type and mutant P-gps and preloaded with doxorubicin (see “Experimental Procedures”). In cells transfected with plasmid pMDR7, expressing wild type P-gp, the time constant for doxorubicin efflux was 827 ± 74 s (mean ± S.E.; n = 14). As a control, cells were transfected with pMDR712, which is mutated in the ATP-binding sites such that drug transport is impaired (Gill et al., 23Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F.

https://openalex.org/W2023312128,"The stimulation of the intracellular cholesterol esterification pathway by atherogenic lipoproteins in macrophages is a key step in the development of atheroma foam cells. The esterification pathway can also be stimulated by hydrolysis of cell-surface sphingomyelin by the enzyme sphingomyelinase (SMase). In both cases, intracellular cholesterol transport to the cholesterol esterifying enzyme, acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT), is thought to be critical, although the mechanism of cholesterol transport is not known. In this report, we explore two fundamental properties of the cholesterol esterification pathway, namely its dependence on energy and the effect of other treatments that block membrane vesicle trafficking. After the atherogenic lipoprotein, β-very low density lipoprotein (β-VLDL), was internalized by macrophages and hydrolyzed in lysosomes, the cells were depleted of energy by treatment with sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose or by permeabilization. Under these conditions, which allowed equal β-VLDL-cholesteryl ester hydrolysis, cholesterol esterification was markedly decreased in the energy-depleted cells. This effect was not due to blockage of lysosomal cholesterol export. In the permeabilized cell system, energy repletion restored β-VLDL-induced cholesterol esterification. Remarkably, stimulation of cholesterol esterification by SMase was not inhibited by energy depletion. Energy depletion also inhibited β-VLDL-induced, but not SMase-induced, cholesterol esterification in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Similar experiments were carried out using N-ethylmaleimide, low potassium medium, or inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, each of which blocks intracellular membrane vesicle trafficking. These treatments also inhibited β-VLDL-induced, but not SMase-induced, cholesterol esterification. Finally, we show here that SMase treatment of cells leads to an increase in plasma membrane vesiculation that is relatively resistant to energy depletion. In summary, the stimulation of cholesterol esterification by lipoproteins, but not by SMase, is energy-dependent, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive, and blocked by both low potassium and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors. The affected step or steps are distal to cholesterol export from lysosomes and not due to direct inhibition of the ACAT enzyme. Thus, the mechanisms involved in lipoprotein-induced versus SMase-induced cholesterol esterification are different, perhaps due to the involvement of energy-dependent vesicular cholesterol transport in the lipoprotein pathway and a novel, energy-independent vesicular transport mechanism in the SMase pathway. The stimulation of the intracellular cholesterol esterification pathway by atherogenic lipoproteins in macrophages is a key step in the development of atheroma foam cells. The esterification pathway can also be stimulated by hydrolysis of cell-surface sphingomyelin by the enzyme sphingomyelinase (SMase). In both cases, intracellular cholesterol transport to the cholesterol esterifying enzyme, acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT), is thought to be critical, although the mechanism of cholesterol transport is not known. In this report, we explore two fundamental properties of the cholesterol esterification pathway, namely its dependence on energy and the effect of other treatments that block membrane vesicle trafficking. After the atherogenic lipoprotein, β-very low density lipoprotein (β-VLDL), was internalized by macrophages and hydrolyzed in lysosomes, the cells were depleted of energy by treatment with sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose or by permeabilization. Under these conditions, which allowed equal β-VLDL-cholesteryl ester hydrolysis, cholesterol esterification was markedly decreased in the energy-depleted cells. This effect was not due to blockage of lysosomal cholesterol export. In the permeabilized cell system, energy repletion restored β-VLDL-induced cholesterol esterification. Remarkably, stimulation of cholesterol esterification by SMase was not inhibited by energy depletion. Energy depletion also inhibited β-VLDL-induced, but not SMase-induced, cholesterol esterification in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Similar experiments were carried out using N-ethylmaleimide, low potassium medium, or inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, each of which blocks intracellular membrane vesicle trafficking. These treatments also inhibited β-VLDL-induced, but not SMase-induced, cholesterol esterification. Finally, we show here that SMase treatment of cells leads to an increase in plasma membrane vesiculation that is relatively resistant to energy depletion.

https://openalex.org/W2074168049,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) transduces signals through two related serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type I and type II receptors, which have the ability to interact with each other. In the heteromeric complex, the type II receptor is the primary determinant of ligand binding and phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of the type I receptor. Using a chimeric receptor strategy, we and others have shown previously that a functional TGF-β receptor complex requires heteromerization of both extracellular and intracellular domains of type I and type II receptors. In the current study, we show that overexpression of two receptors carrying a heteromeric combination of cytoplasmic domains resulted in ligand-independent responses, further supporting the functional requirement of the two heterologous cytoplasmic domains in TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, coexpression of only the cytoplasmic domains of both the type I and II receptors or tethering the type II to the type I cytoplasmic domain activated TGF-β responses in a ligand-independent manner. In cotransfected COS-1 cells, both cytoplasmic domains are associated with each other. Our results indicate that the cytoplasmic domains of the type I and type II TGF-β receptors physically and functionally interact with each other in the heteromeric complex."

This may denote their role in templating the male genome prior to fertilization, thus ensuring the formation of a viable male pronucleus during early embryonic development. INTRODUCTIONFor many years the nuclear matrix received little attention, as it was thought to act merely as a structural element(1.Baskin Y. Science. 1995; 268: 1564-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It has now been suggested that the nuclear matrix may play a key role in genome organization and gene potentiation(2.Zlatanova J.S. van Holde K.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 211-224PubMed Google Scholar). As in the somatic nucleus, chromatin within the male gamete is organized into discrete loops, bound at the base by regions of attachment to the nuclear matrix(3.Ward W.S. Coffey D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These loops differ from their somatic counterparts with respect to the packaging of their DNA (4.Ward W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and their average size. Loops within the sperm nucleus are ∼27 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)SMARsperm nuclear matrix attachment regionMARsomatic nuclear matrix attachment regionPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s). in size (5.Barone J.G. De Lara J. Cummings K.B. Ward W.S. J. Androl. 1994; 15: 139-145PubMed Google Scholar) compared with ∼60 kb in all other types of cells studied to date(6.Vogelstein B. Pardoll D.M. Coffey D.S. Cell. 1980; 22: 79-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). We have termed these sperm nuclear matrix attachment regions (SMARs) (7.Kramer J.A. Krawetz S.A. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The somatic nuclear matrix has come under intense study, as actively transcribed genes have been shown to be associated with the nuclear matrix(8.Ciejek E. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1983; 306: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Somatic nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs) have been identified in or near introns(9.Jarman A.P. Higgs D.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3337-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), enhancers(10.Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1986; 46: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), origins of replication(11.Kalandadze A.G. Bushara S.A. Vassetzky Y.S. Razin S.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and sites of transcription initiation(12.Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5398-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), as well as other regulatory elements(9.Jarman A.P. Higgs D.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3337-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). MARs have also been identified at the ends of the DNase I-sensitive domain in numerous loci (13.Levy-Wilson B. Fortier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21196-21204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Loc P.-V. Strätling W.H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and shown to facilitate position-independent gene activity(15.Stief A. Winter D.M. Strätling W.H. Sippel A.E. Nature. 1989; 341: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The function of the sperm nuclear matrix is comparatively unknown.An ∼40-kb region of human chromosome 16p13.13 has recently been sequenced in its entirety and shown to contain the genes for the sperm-specific protamine 1, protamine 2, and transition protein 2 proteins(16.Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31067-31073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNase I sensitivity analysis has delineated the boundaries of the domain in the mature spermatozoan, and transgenic analysis has shown that this region of the genome contains all the elements necessary for the appropriate spatial and temporal expression of the genes of this cluster in a position-independent, copy number-dependent manner(17.Choudhary S.K. Wykes S.M. Kramer J.A. Mohamed A.N. Koppitch F. Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8755-8762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To characterize structural elements that mediate this response, we have identified regions of genomic interaction with the sperm nuclear matrix. Further, we demonstrate that a specific subset of both haploid-specific and constitutively expressed genes are associated with the mature sperm nuclear matrix. These genes assume an altered structural conformation as evidenced by their increased sensitivity to DNase I. Thus, the mature sperm genome is organized in a specific non-random manner. This could provide the means to template the male genome for ordered protamine replacement immediately subsequent to fertilization.MATERIALS AND METHODSPhysical characterization of each of the candidate MARs employed nuclei prepared from frozen sperm essentially as described(19.Ward W.S. Partin A.W. Coffey D.S. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nuclei were resuspended in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, buffer containing 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgOAc, and 25% glycerol, at ∼1 × 107/ml, and then used immediately or stored flash frozen at −80°C. DNA halos were prepared from fresh or frozen sperm nuclei as described(5.Barone J.G. De Lara J. Cummings K.B. Ward W.S. J. Androl. 1994; 15: 139-145PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, sperm nuclei were mixed with an equal volume of 2 M NaCl buffered with 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and then pelleted at 4°C for 30 min at 1,600 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, buffer containing 2 M NaCl and then adjusted to contain 10 mM dithiothreitol. The nuclei were then incubated on ice for 30 min. The resulting halos were centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min at 1,600 × g and then resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2. Aliquots were stained with propidium iodide and then visualized by fluorescent illumination using a Leitz DIAPLAN microscope. The remaining halo DNA was subsequently digested with BstXI, EcoRI, HindIII, or StyI for 4 h at 37°C. Successful restriction enzyme digestion was assayed by the inability to amplify across known sites. Following digestion, an equal aliquot of 4 M NaCl was added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 10 min at 37°C. The loop and matrix fractions were then separated by centrifugation for 30 min at 9,000 × g at 4°C. The fractions thus separated were subsequently purified using Prep-A-Gene matrix (Bio-Rad) and then resuspended in deionized water. PCR amplification was performed on both the loop and matrix-associated fractions utilizing primer pairs directed to the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 locus, many of which have been described previously. 2Primer sequences, PCR conditions, and the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 domain sequence will be made available at the internet address “http://compbio.med.wayne.edu/”. PCR was maintained within the linear range of amplification. DNA halos were prepared from HeLa cells essentially as described(21.Gerdes M.G. Carter K.C. Moen P.T. Bently-Lawrence J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), digested to completion with HindIII, and then treated as described above for sperm halos.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo begin to elucidate the elements necessary to potentiate this domain, candidate regions of sperm nuclear matrix association within the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 biological locus were identified utilizing a computational strategy. Characteristic MAR motifs were gathered from the literature (7.Kramer J.A. Krawetz S.A. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22.Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and then expressed as unique sequence patterns as described(18.Kramer, J. A., Singh, G. B., Krawetz, S. A. (1996) Genomics, in pressGoogle Scholar). In this manner, the ∼40-kb sequence containing the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 biological locus was queried for the presence of various sequence patterns indicative of MARs. Motifs were then weighted according to their expected frequency in a random sequence of the same base composition as that of the sequence queried. A weighted sum was subsequently applied to each region along the locus using a sliding window of 1000 bp with a 100-bp step size. The results are presented graphically in Fig. 1. Regions above a likelihood of 50% were considered as candidates to have strong nuclear matrix binding potential. This computer analysis predicted two SMARs centered at nucleotide positions 8,175 and 34,100 (Fig. 1). These potential SMARs were similar to those previously identified in this locus (7.Kramer J.A. Krawetz S.A. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and were used to guide their physical identification.DNA “halos” were prepared by extracting sperm nuclei with a high ionic strength reducing buffer(5.Barone J.G. De Lara J. Cummings K.B. Ward W.S. J. Androl. 1994; 15: 139-145PubMed Google Scholar). This displaced the histones and protamines from the chromatin, while leaving the DNA attached at discrete points to the intact nuclear matrix. The resulting halo structures were then stained with propidium iodide and visualized by fluorescence microscopy as shown in Fig. 2. The intact nuclei stained in a uniform manner, consistent with tightly packaged sperm chromatin, while the halo structures showed a more dispersed pattern of staining. Regions of the sperm chromatin that remained associated with the nuclear matrix possessed a brightly staining center, while the unassociated loop DNA stained dimly. This was manifested as a broad fibrous “halo” of fluorescence surrounding the brightly stained nuclear matrix.Figure 2:Fluorescence microscopy of human sperm nuclei and DNA halos. Panel a, sperm nuclei; panel b, the corresponding DNA halo. Non-matrix-associated chromatin loops out from the proteinaceous matrix upon the depletion of the protamines and histones. The non-matrix-associated DNA appears as a halo around the more brightly stained nuclear scaffold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To separate the nuclear matrix-bound and unbound DNA, halos were digested with various restriction endonucleases, and then the nuclear matrix-bound DNA was pelleted. Both fractions were purified and then subjected to PCR amplification using unique sets of primers targeted to discrete regions of the haploid-expressed PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 locus and the somatic expressed β-globin locus (Fig. 3). The distribution of each amplicon showed one of three patterns. The majority, i.e. at least 80% of the non-matrix-associated loop DNA, partitioned to the supernatant. Similarly, greater than 80% of the matrix-attached DNA partitioned with the nuclear pellet. In contrast, intermediately matrix-associated DNA partitioned into both the supernatant and pellet (30-70%). Regions that lay outside the DNase I-sensitive domain localized consistently to the non-matrix-associated loop fraction, as did the DNase I-insensitive β-globin locus. Regions within the domain were intermediately associated with the nuclear matrix. This intermediate affinity for the sperm nuclear matrix is similar to that observed for the human β-interferon locus(23.Mielke C. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Bode J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7475-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The region surrounding and including the potentiated β-interferon gene shows weak nuclear matrix association and is bounded by points of stronger contact with the nuclear matrix. Regions near the ends of the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 DNase I-sensitive domain were bound to the sperm nuclear matrix. These appear to be localized in a manner similar to the MARs of the chicken lysozyme (13.Levy-Wilson B. Fortier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21196-21204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human apolipoprotein B (14.Loc P.-V. Strätling W.H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) loci. The 5′ region of attachment to the sperm nuclear matrix was bounded by positions 8,818-9,760, while the corresponding 3′ region was bounded by positions 32,586-33,536. The strong attachment to the nuclear matrix of these ∼950-bp regions at the ends of the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 DNase I-sensitive domain suggests the presence of a sequence-dependent MAR-like element. However, these regions do not share extensive similarity.Figure 3:Loop and matrix-associated segments of the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 domain. The relative DNase I-sensitive profile that defined the human PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 domain is shown (adapted from (17.Choudhary S.K. Wykes S.M. Kramer J.A. Mohamed A.N. Koppitch F. Nelson J.E.

The PRM1, PRM2, and TNP2 genes are indicated as hatched boxes positioned along the corresponding sequence of human chromosome 16p13.13(20.Doggett N.A. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 335-365PubMed Google Scholar). DNA halos were prepared, digested with various restriction endonucleases, separated into their loop (supernatant) and nuclear matrix-bound (pellet) fractions, and purified. PCR primer pairs that span specific regions of the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 domain are shown below the ruler as small black boxes.2 Primer pairs delimit the corresponding amplicons within the loop and nuclear matrix fractions. A PCR primer set directed to the β-globin locus was used as a non-matrix-associated control. This same region of the β-globin locus contains a somatic MAR, as shown in HeLa nuclei. Nuclear matrix-bound restriction fragments in which greater than 80% of the amplicon partitioned with the matrix-bound fraction are identified as black boxes. Nuclear matrix-associated fragments are indicated by gray boxes for those amplicons that partitioned (30-70%) within both fractions. Non-matrix-associated fragments are demarcated by open boxes for those amplicons that comprised from 0 to 20% of the matrix fraction. Large restriction fragments that contain the SMARs often showed sterically reduced localization to the matrix fraction. Sites of attachment to the nuclear matrix are denoted as stars. Matrix association for the StyI-digested sample could not be ascertained for the β-globin locus, as there is a StyI site between the β-globin primers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Regions of intermediate nuclear matrix association are likely to reflect local differences in the organization of sperm chromatin. It has been shown that approximately 15% of the chromatin in human sperm remains histone-bound rather than undergoing protamine replacement (24.Gatewood J.M. Cook G.R. Balhorn R. Bradbury E.M. Schmid C.W. Science. 1987; 236: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The intermediate association that is observed (Fig. 3) may reflect differential affinity of the sperm nuclear matrix for histone-bound chromatin as compared with protamine-bound chromatin. This is consistent with previous DNase I-sensitivity data of the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 domain in human sperm(17.Choudhary S.K. Wykes S.M. Kramer J.A. Mohamed A.N. Koppitch F. Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8755-8762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), reflecting increased accessibility of this segment of the genome to the exogenous nuclease. Accordingly, DNase I sensitivity may be correlated with the degree of interaction of each gene with the sperm nuclear matrix. To test this hypothesis, mature spermatozoa loop and matrix-bound DNAs were subjected to PCR analysis using primer sets directed toward numerous well characterized loci throughout the human genome. As shown in Fig. 4, PCR analysis of the regions containing the PRM1, PRM2, and TNP2 genes showed that these genes were associated with the nuclear matrix. Similarly, amplification of regions of the α-globin HBA2 and β-actin genes, which are also DNase I-sensitive in mature spermatozoa, 3J. A. Kramer and S. A. Krawetz, unpublished observations. also showed an association with the sperm nuclear matrix. In contrast, the β-globin, acrosin, and PGK-1 and PGK-2 genes, all of which are DNase I-insensitive in terminally differentiated mature spermatozoa,3 showed no association with the sperm nuclear matrix. In somatic nuclei, DNase I sensitivity has been shown to correlate directly with the potentiation of genes for transcription. While there does not appear to be any transcription in mature sperm, the intermediate association of the DNase I-sensitive regions with the sperm nuclear matrix may represent a means by which the paternal genome is imprinted for activation and/or templated for postfertilization protamine replacement. Both processes are necessary for the formation of a viable male pronucleus.Figure 4:DNase I sensitivity and nuclear matrix association are coincident in the male haploid genome. BstXI-digested halos were separated into their loop (supernatant) and nuclear matrix-bound (pellet) fractions and then purified. Amplicon localization is characterized by the degree of localization to the loop or matrix fraction, represented by the percent scale. The DNase I-insensitive β-globin, PGK-1, PGK-2, and acrosin genes showed no association with the sperm nuclear matrix (open boxes). The DNase I-sensitive PRM1 gene, PRM2 gene, and TNP2 gene as well as the β-actin and α-globin genes were predominantly associated with the nuclear matrix fraction (gray boxes). Only β-globin and β-actin showed an interaction with the HeLa nuclear matrix (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is clear that MARs and SMARs share only limited sequence and organizational characteristics. For example, the mouse β-globin locus has been shown to contain a MAR that functions independently of the type of somatic cell(29.Greenstein R.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It always anchors that region of the genome to the somatic nuclear matrix. As shown for HeLa nuclei in Fig. 3, this property is shared with the human β-globin locus. However, unlike the organization within the somatic nucleus, this region clearly does not interact with the mature haploid sperm nuclear matrix. This is in corollary with that observed for the haploid sperm-specific PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 locus.In accord with the data presented above and that of others, there must be more than one type of association with the nuclear matrix. It is reasonable to assume that there are at least four classes of nuclear matrix association, i.e. regulatory element-associated MARs, somatic boundary elements, haploid boundary elements, and structurally associated elements. Class 1 regulatory element-associated MARs possess an innate ability to be bound by the nuclear matrix as they can be identified by an in vitro competition assay(26.Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). These MARs are not typically situated at the ends of the DNase I-sensitive domain. They have been localized to regions containing enhancers(10.Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1986; 46: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), origins of replication(11.Kalandadze A.G. Bushara S.A. Vassetzky Y.S. Razin S.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and other regulatory elements (9.Jarman A.P. Higgs D.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3337-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and may also represent regions where transcriptionally generated supercoiling is relaxed(2.Zlatanova J.S. van Holde K.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 211-224PubMed Google Scholar). Class 1 MARs likely contain specific consensus sequences recognized by cell-specific nuclear matrix proteins. In fact, the nuclear matrix protein NMP-1, which binds to specific sequences within the histone H4 gene, has recently been shown to be the transcription factor YY1(27.Guo B. Odgren P.R. van Wijnen A.J. Last T.J. Nickerson J. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10526-10530Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, most of these MARs probably do not act as promoters or enhancers themselves. Instead, proximity of the regulatory element to the matrix-associated region and the nuclear matrix may concentrate all of the diverse elements necessary for transcription. In light of the locus-specific regulatory sequence motifs and the array of cell-specific proteins within the nuclear matrix(28.Fey E.G. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), it is possible that no single consensus sequence for the class 1 MAR will be identified.Class 2 somatic boundary element MARs are localized to the ends of DNase I-sensitive domains and act as boundary elements in somatic nuclei. They may shield loci against inappropriate potentiation and silencing in multiple types of cells. The MARs of the chicken lysozyme locus that delimit the DNase I-sensitive domain have been shown to mediate position-independent expression(15.Stief A. Winter D.M. Strätling W.H. Sippel A.E. Nature. 1989; 341: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that end region MARs may regulate transcription by inducing negative superhelical torsional stress across the domains that they limit(2.Zlatanova J.S. van Holde K.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 211-224PubMed Google Scholar). A universal consensus sequence for this second class of MAR should become clear as more are identified and sequenced, since many loci possess cell type-independent end region MARs. The AT-rich MAR may be representative of this class.The regions of matrix association described above for the haploid-specific PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 domain are representative of class 3 haploid boundary element nuclear matrix attachment regions, i.e. SMARs. This report is the first identification of a haploid-specific MAR. Like the class 2 MARs, SMARs seem to act as boundary elements, attaching the ends of chromatin domains to the sperm nuclear matrix. The validation of the computational model suggests that SMAR sequences resemble those of the class 2 somatic boundary element MARs. However, MARs and SMARs are not identical. Unlike class 3 SMARs, class 2 somatic MARs have been shown to be cell type-independent. For example, MARs of three developmentally regulated Drosophila melanogaster genes have been shown to exhibit identical binding profiles regardless of tissue type or developmental stage(10.Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1986; 46: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Further, MARs from the β-globin locus remain constant throughout the induction of terminal differentiation of the erythroid progenitors(29.Greenstein R.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), while MARs of the chicken histone genes have been shown to be retained throughout the cell cycle(30.Dalton S. Younghusband H.B. Wells J.R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6507-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These differences among the class 3 SMARs and the class 1 and class 2 MARs are highlighted in Figure 3:, Figure 4:. Genes like β-globin that contain a somatic cell type-independent MAR (29.Greenstein R.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) do not partition with the sperm nuclear matrix, and SMARs of the haploid-expressed PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 domain do not attach to the HeLa nuclear matrix (Fig. 3). As with the class 2 MARs, identification of a consensus sequence for SMARs will depend upon the identification and sequencing of multiple SMARs.The intermediate association with the sperm nuclear matrix of those genes that exhibit DNase I sensitivity in mature spermatozoa can be considered to exemplify a class 4 structurally mediated nuclear matrix association. This intermediate affinity for the sperm nuclear matrix may be similar to that observed for the somatic expressed β-interferon gene. However, in haploid cells, this cannot be identified using an in vitro competition assay, and it appears that it is not dependent on the presence of a consensus sequence. It is not known if this type of association reflects a structural parameter specific to sperm chromatin.While the function of MARs has been discussed extensively, the biological role for nuclear matrix attachment and nuclear matrix association within the male haploid genome remains to be clarified. The class 3 end region SMARs, like the class 2 end region MARs discussed above, appear to act as boundary elements. It is not clear whether they shield from position effects, as has been shown for some class 2 MARs (15.Stief A. Winter D.M. Strätling W.H. Sippel A.E. Nature. 1989; 341: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Three independent lines of transgenic animals containing SMARs from the PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 locus have been shown to yield copy number-dependent, site of integration-independent expression(17.Choudhary S.K. Wykes S.M. Kramer J.A. Mohamed A.N. Koppitch F. Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8755-8762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, such expression can also be achieved by a locus control region, as exemplified by the β-globin locus(25.Philipsen S. Talbot D. Fraser P. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 7: 2159-2167Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Whether the human PRM1 → PRM2 → TNP2 locus contains an locus control region and/or utilizes the SMARs as a means of locus control remains uncertain.The haploid-specific SMARs and the intermediately associated regions described above represent two of at least four classes of nuclear matrix-associated regions. Further clarification of the classes and functions of various nuclear matrix-associated regions will prove both interesting and enlightening toward the study of the mechanisms of gene potentiation and paternal genome templating. INTRODUCTIONFor many years the nuclear matrix received little attention, as it was thought to act merely as a structural element(1.Baskin Y. Science. 1995; 268: 1564-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It has now been suggested that the nuclear matrix may play a key role in genome organization and gene potentiation(2.Zlatanova J.S. van Holde K.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 211-224PubMed Google Scholar). As in the somatic nucleus, chromatin within the male gamete is organized into discrete loops, bound at the base by regions of attachment to the nuclear matrix(3.Ward W.S. Coffey D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These loops differ from their somatic counterparts with respect to the packaging of their DNA (4.Ward W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and their average size. Loops within the sperm nucleus are ∼27 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)SMARsperm nuclear matrix attachment regionMARsomatic nuclear matrix attachment regionPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s). in size (5.Barone J.G. De Lara J. Cummings K.B. Ward W.S. J. Androl. 1994; 15: 139-145PubMed Google Scholar) compared with ∼60 kb in all other types of cells studied to date(6.Vogelstein B. Pardoll D.M. Coffey D.S. Cell. 1980; 22: 79-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). We have termed these sperm nuclear matrix attachment regions (SMARs) (7.Kramer J.A. Krawetz S.A. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The somatic nuclear matrix has come under intense study, as actively transcribed genes have been shown to be associated with the nuclear matrix(8.Ciejek E. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1983; 306: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Somatic nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs) have been identified in or near introns(9.Jarman A.P. Higgs D.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3337-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), enhancers(10.Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1986; 46: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), origins of replication(11.Kalandadze A.G. Bushara S.A. Vassetzky Y.S. Razin S.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and sites of transcription initiation(12.Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5398-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), as well as other regulatory elements(9.Jarman A.P. Higgs D.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3337-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). MARs have also been identified at the ends of the DNase I-sensitive domain in numerous loci (13.Levy-Wilson B. Fortier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21196-21204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Loc P.-V. Strätling W.H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and shown to facilitate position-independent gene activity(15.Stief A. Winter D.M. Strätling W.H. Sippel A.E. Nature. 1989; 341: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The function of the sperm nuclear matrix is comparatively unknown.An ∼40-kb region of human chromosome 16p13.13 has recently been sequenced in its entirety and shown to contain the genes for the sperm-specific protamine 1, protamine 2, and transition protein 2 proteins(16.Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31067-31073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNase I sensitivity analysis has delineated the boundaries of the domain in the mature spermatozoan, and transgenic analysis has shown that this region of the genome contains all the elements necessary for the appropriate spatial and temporal expression of the genes of this cluster in a position-independent, copy number-dependent manner(17.Choudhary S.K. Wykes S.M. Kramer J.A. Mohamed A.N. Koppitch F. Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8755-8762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To characterize structural elements that mediate this response, we have identified regions of genomic interaction with the sperm nuclear matrix. Further, we demonstrate that a specific subset of both haploid-specific and constitutively expressed genes are associated with the mature sperm nuclear matrix. These genes assume an altered structural conformation as evidenced by their increased sensitivity to DNase I. Thus, the mature sperm genome is organized in a specific non-random manner. This could provide the means to template the male genome for ordered protamine replacement immediately subsequent to fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2089629454,"We have investigated potential Gi and Gs coupling domains within the intracellular regions of the α2AAR subtype using a series of nine chimeric mutations. The second intracellular loop (ICL2, amino acids 133-149) and the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the third intracellular loop (ICL3, amino acids 218-235 and 355-371, respectively) of the cloned human α2AAR were substituted with the analogous sequence from either the Gs-coupled β2AR or the Gi-coupled serotonin type 1A receptor (5-HT1AR). Mutant and wild type α2AAR were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and functional coupling of each receptor to Gi and Gs was assessed in membrane adenylyl cyclase assays. Substitution of 5-HT1AR sequence into ICL2 ablated coupling to Gs but not to Gi, whereas substitution of β2AR sequence significantly depressed coupling to Gi but not to Gs. Thus, the ICL2 of the α2AAR contains elements essential for both signaling pathways. Substitution of either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal segments of ICL3 with 5-HT1AR sequence ablated agonist stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity (without affecting inhibition), suggesting that both domains are necessary for α2AAR coupling to Gs. In contrast, individual substitution of β2AR sequence into ICL3 amino or carboxyl termini had no appreciable effect on Gi coupling. Concomitant substitution of β2AR sequence into both regions substantially impaired Gi coupling, implying that each is capable of independently supporting functional coupling. Substitution of 5-HT1AR at either locus had no effect on Gi coupling. Thus, for Gs coupling, these two domains within ICL3 are both required for functional coupling. However, for Gi coupling, the α2AAR appears to have two distinct regions within ICL3 that are capable of supporting Gi coupling independently. There has been no previous elucidation of a receptor having redundant, fully competent domains for coupling to a single class of G-protein. Such duplicity of functional domains within α2AR may suggest strong evolutionary pressure to maintain Gi coupling. We have investigated potential Gi and Gs coupling domains within the intracellular regions of the α2AAR subtype using a series of nine chimeric mutations.

https://openalex.org/W1964812048,"We have theorized that a subset of PiZZ α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT)-deficient individuals is more susceptible to liver injury by virtue of second inherited trait(s) or environmental factor(s), which exaggerate the accumulation of mutant α1-AT Z within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of liver cells. Using a complementation approach in which cell lines from PiZZ individuals with liver disease (“susceptible” hosts) and from PiZZ individuals without liver disease (“protected” hosts) are transduced with the mutant α1-AT Z gene, we have recently shown that there is a delay in ER degradation of mutant α1-AT Z protein that is only present in cell lines from susceptible hosts and correlates with the liver disease phenotype.

The S mutant of α1-AT and H2a subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR H2a) were expressed in skin fibroblast cell lines from susceptible and protected hosts. The results showed in both susceptible and protected hosts that α1-AT S was associated with a delay in secretion as compared with wild type α1-AT.

There was, however, a significant increase in retention of α1-AT S in the ER of susceptible as compared with protected host cells. The same host cell lines were transduced to express an unassembled membrane protein, ASGPR H2a. There was no difference in the kinetics of ER degradation of ASGPR H2a in susceptible as compared with protected hosts. Taken together, the results show that α1-AT S is associated with a defect in biogenesis, intracellular retention, which is similar to but milder than α1-AT Z.

The purified His-tagged wild-type protein could be functionally reconstituted in the presence of detergent and sterol and behaved in black lipid bilayer membranes indistinguishably from native porin isolated from Neurospora crassa mitochondria. Mutants of porin lacking part of the N terminus (ΔN2-12porin, ΔN3-20porin), part of the C terminus (ΔC269-283porin), or both (ΔN2-12/ΔC269-283porin) also showed channel forming activity. The mutant porin lacking the C terminus had a smaller single channel conductance than the wild-type protein, but its other biophysical properties were identical. ΔN2-12porin and ΔN3-20porin formed noisy channels with decreased channel stability. These channels were still voltage-dependent. ΔN2-12/ΔC269-283porin lost channel stability and had altered gating characteristics. These results are discussed with respect to different models that have been proposed in the literature for the structure of mitochondrial porin channels. To investigate the role of the N and C termini in channel function and voltage-dependent gating of mitochondrial porin, we expressed wild-type and mutant porins from Neurospora crassa as His-tag fusion products in Escherichia coli. Large quantities of the proteins were purified by chromatography across a nickle-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column under denaturing conditions. The purified His-tagged wild-type protein could be functionally reconstituted in the presence of detergent and sterol and behaved in black lipid bilayer membranes indistinguishably from native porin isolated from Neurospora crassa mitochondria.

The mitochondrial outer membrane separates the internal compartments of the mitochondrion from the cytoplasm. To allow the exchange of the mostly anionic metabolites between cytosol and intermembrane space, it has to act as a molecular sieve for hydrophilic solutes (O'Brien and Brierly, 29Brien R.L.

Mitochondrial porins form water-filled channels that are slightly anion-selective in the open state and cation-selective in the voltage-induced ion-permeable “closed” states (Benz, 2Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). According to reconstitution experiments with planar lipid bilayers and liposomes (Colombini, 9Colombini M. J. Membr.

Reconstitution of water-soluble porin into artificial membranes requires a detergent, such as Triton X-100 (Pfaller et al., 32Pfaller R. Freitag H. Harmey M.A. Benz R. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8188-8193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cholesterol. In particular, sterols seem to be important for the formation of the channel unit in the aqueous phase before its insertion into the membrane, rather than for association with the membrane (Popp et al., 34Popp B.

The channel properties such as single channel conductance, voltage dependence, and selectivity are highly conserved among them. However, the overall identity of their primary structures is relatively low. Nonetheless there exists a high homology in their predicted secondary structures. Notably, all porins contain stretches of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, suggesting the formation of amphipathic β-strands (for review see Benz, 2Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Thus, the polypeptide chain of mitochondrial porins may be arranged in a β-barrel cylinder containing either 16 antiparallel, amphiphilic β-strands (De Pinto et al., 15De Pinto V. Prezioso G. Thinnes F. Link T.A. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10191-10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar; Benz, 2Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) or 12 β-strands and the amphiphilic N-terminal α-helix (Blachly-Dyson et al., 4Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As a result of these predictions, the models to explain the gating of the mitochondrial outer membrane channel differ to a great extent. The latter structural model suggests large scale rearrangements of the channel core during closing, including trans-membrane movement of the N terminus and/or β-strands (Peng et al., 30Peng S. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 123-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar; Thomas et al., 38Thomas L. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. Forte M. Proc.

Biol. 1995; 144: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The former model assumes that the movement of loops not embedded in the membrane is responsible for channel gating, as is the case in bacterial porins (Benz, 2Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To investigate the channel structure in more detail, we created deletion mutants of Neurospora crassa porin and analyzed the biophysical properties of the mutant channels. Specifically, we studied the role of the N terminus in channel formation and voltage dependence. In addition, we asked whether the C terminus contributes to the β-barrel structure. The plasmid pQE-9 and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose were obtained from Quiagen (Hilden, Germany). Ceramic HTP 1The abbreviations used are: HTPhydroxyapatiteDiphPCdiphytanoyl-phosphatidylcholineHis-taghexa-histidinyl tagPCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisnSnanosiemens. was bought from Bio-Rad (München, Germany) and ergosterol (cholest-5,7,22-trien-24-methyl-3β-ol) from Sigma.

All salts and buffers were of analytical grade and obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). hydroxyapatite diphytanoyl-phosphatidylcholine hexa-histidinyl tag polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nanosiemens. The standard laboratory strain of N. crassa, strain 74A, was grown and maintained as described (Davis and De Serres, 11Davis R.H. De Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 79-143Crossref Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from mycelia grown in liquid culture as previously outlined (Pfanner and Neupert, 33Pfanner N. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and porin was prepared from whole mitochondria and purified by chromatography over an HTP column essentially as described previously (De Pinto et al., 13De Pinto V. Ludwig O. Krause J. Benz R. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894 (a): 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14De Pinto V. Prezioso G. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905 (b): 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), except that Triton X-100 was exchanged by Genapol X-80 and normal HTP by ceramic HTP. The porin constructs used in this study were generated from the cDNA clone obtained by Kleene et al. (23Kleene R. Pfanner N. Pfaller R. Link T.A. Sebald W. Neupert W. Tropschug M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2627-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It was recloned in a pBluescript KS− vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To produce the coding sequence for ΔN2-12porin, the BamHI-NarI fragment containing the first 229 base pairs of the porin coding sequence was replaced with a PCR product generated with primers encompassing the corresponding coding region but lacking the first 12 amino acids. The upstream primer (5′AAAGGATCCATGGCCAACGACCTCCTCAACAAGG) incorporates sites for BamHI and NcoI and an in-frame start codon into the 5′-end of the PCR product. The second oligonucleotide (5′CCTGAAGTGGAGGTTGAACTTGGC) hybridized to a sequence just downstream of the endogenous NarI site. The resulting mutant genes in pBluescript were then cloned into pQE-9 as BamHI-EcoRI fragments encompassing the entire coding sequences. This strategy resulted in the addition of the amino acid sequence MRGSHHHHHHGS (single-letter code) upstream of the original initiation methionine (Fig. 8). The six histidine residues comprise a “His-tag” which allows purification of the protein as described below. In a similar manner, oligonucleotides 5′AAAGGATCCATGGCTGTTCCCGCTTC and 5′AAAGGATCCATGGCTTTCTACCACCTCGCTG were used as upstream primers to generate the coding sequences for a His-tagged, full-length porin and for ΔN3-20porin, respectively. The ΔC269-283porin and ΔN2-12/ΔC269-283porin clones were produced by digesting either ΔN2-12porin or the His-tagged, wild-type DNA (in pQE-9) with HindIII and religation. This resulted in the deletion of amino acids 269-283 and the addition of a single glutamine residue at the C terminus (Fig. 8). The stop codon was encoded by the vector. All PCR-derived DNA fragments were sequenced using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). No undesired alterations were found except for a silent mutation in codon 67 (GGC mutated to GGT) in ΔN2-12porin and its derivative ΔN2-12/ΔC269-283porin. An overnight culture in DYT medium (16 g of Bacto-tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl dissolved in 1 liter of distilled water) of the Escherichia coli strain M15 (Villajero and Zabin, 40Villajero M.R. Zabin I. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 466-474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the respective vector was diluted and grown to an A600 of 0.7-0.9. Expression was induced by adding isopropylthiogalactoside to a final concentration of 2 mM, and the culture was grown for an additional 4-5 h before harvesting the cells by centrifugation. The recombinant porins were purified from the total bacterial pellet under denaturing conditions (8 M urea) by adsorption to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column followed by extensive washing of the chromatographic material, as described by the supplier of the pQE-9 vector. The pure protein was eluted in 100 mM EDTA, 8 M urea and diluted 1:10 into 2% Genapol, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7, before dialysis against the same buffer. This stock solution was stored at −20°C. Sterol suspensions were prepared by evaporating a solution of ergosterol in chloroform and then suspending the sterol at a concentration of 1% (w/v) in 2% Genapol, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7. One volume of porin (10-20 µl containing 2-30 ng/ml protein) was mixed with 1 volume of a 1% (w/v) ergosterol suspension and vortexed for 10 s. The samples were then stored on ice until use. The methods used for the “black” lipid bilayer experiments have been described previously (Benz et al., 1978). In brief, membranes were formed from a 1% (w/v) solution of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DiphPC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in n-decane across circular holes (surface area about 0.1 mm2) in the thin wall of a Teflon cell separating the two aqueous compartments of 5-ml volume. The aqueous solutions were either unbuffered, pH 6, or were buffered with 10 mM Hepes, pH 7. Porin was added from the stock solutions to the aqueous phase of the cis compartment (the compartment to which the voltage was applied) after the membranes had turned optically black in reflected light. Previous studies of mutant mitochondrial porins utilized proteins that had been expressed in yeast (Blachly-Dyson et al., 6Blachly-Dyson E. Baldini A. Litt M. McCabe E.R. Forte M. Genomics. 1994; 20: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These mutant proteins had to be isolated and purified from yeast mitochondria. We chose an bacterial expression system, which allows the rapid and simple production of large amounts of mitochondrial porin. To ease purification, recombinant mitochondrial porin was expressed with an N-terminal hexa-histidinyl tag (His-tag). Full-length, His-tagged mitochondrial porin (which will be referred to as His6porin) and different deletion mutants could be obtained in high amounts from the E. coli cells. The expression level for all proteins was around 50 µg of recombinant protein/ml of bacterial culture. The purified protein samples were free of contaminating bacterial protein as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The denatured protein could be functionally renatured by dilution into a buffer that contains 2% Genapol X-80 to prevent aggregation of the protein. This protein stock could be used after further dilution and preincubation with ergosterol (the major sterol from fungi) for reconstitution experiments. We first compared the properties of wild-type porin carrying an N-terminal His-tag with those of “native” mitochondrial porin purified from N. crassa mitochondria. The recombinant His-tagged protein was added to the aqueous phase bathing a lipid bilayer membrane. Channel formation was not observed until ergosterol was added (see below). In similar experiments we added native porin (isolated from mitochondria) to the membranes. We did not observe any significant difference in the distribution of the single channel conductances (Fig. 2) of channels formed by the two types of porins. Furthermore, the voltage dependence, a characteristic feature of the mitochondrial porins, was identical for both porins (Fig. 3). Likewise, no difference was seen in the ion selectivity of the two preparations (see Table I). Thus, the purified His-tagged mitochondrial porin behaves indistinguishably from native porin isolated from mitochondria. Purified mutant porins carrying an N-terminal His-tag were used to study the roles of the N and C termini in porin structure and function. ΔN2-12porin and ΔN3-20porin lack part or all of the potentially amphipathic α-helix at the N terminus of the protein. ΔC269-283porin lacks the sequence predicted to form the final one or two β-strands (see Fig. 8), and ΔN2-12/ΔC269-283porin contains a combination of the deletions found in ΔN2-12porin and ΔC269-283porin. The N-terminal sequences deleted in the first two mutants are predicted to cross the membrane (Blachly-Dyson et al., 4Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) or to lie at the surface of the outer membrane facing either the cytoplasm (De Pinto et al., 15De Pinto V. Prezioso G. Thinnes F. Link T.A. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10191-10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) or the intermembrane space (Stanley et al., 37Stanley S. Dias J.A. D'Arcangelis D. Mannella C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16694-16700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Channels were observed when each of the deletion mutant porins was added to the salt solution bathing lipid bilayer membranes (Fig. 4). However, the channel forming activity, i.e. the conductance increase for a given protein concentration, was about 10-fold lower for all deletion mutants in comparison to the His6porin (data not shown). The reason for this is unknown, but it is possible that imperfect folding of part of the protein caused the reduced channel forming activity of the deletion mutants. As found for His6porin, the channel forming activity of the deletion mutants was dependent on preincubation of the protein with ergosterol. At low salt concentrations (50 and 150 mM KCl) or in 1 M LiCl, no channels could be observed without addition of ergosterol. Only at higher salt concentrations we observed channel formation, albeit with lower activity (data not shown). The single channel properties of the ΔN2-12porin and ΔN3-20porin were different from those of the His6porin (Fig. 4). Whereas the conductance increase produced by the native and the His6porins occurred in distinct steps, the N-terminal deletion mutants showed “noisy” single channel behavior (Fig. 4, data not shown for Δ2-12porin). Each single channel showed fast fluctuations on top of a stable state. After insertion of several channels into a lipid bilayer membrane, the fluctuations added up to noisy current recordings, in which single steps could no longer be discriminated. This current noise made it difficult to distinguish more than a few steps in a given membrane. Despite the current noise we observed conductance steps of about 4 nS for both the ΔN2-12porin and the ΔN3-20porin (Fig. 5). This indicates that the N-terminal mutants can generate pores of the same dimensions as the wild-type protein. The large number of low conductance steps in the histograms (Fig. 5, A and B) probably results from the instability of the pores rather than the insertion of smaller channels. The mutant ΔC269-283porin did not show a similar current noise as did all the N-terminal mutants (Fig. 4C). As with the wild-type porin, the conductance increase occurred in distinct steps, although they were significantly smaller than that of the wild-type and the His6porin. The histogram of the single channel conductances obtained with the ΔC269-283porin mutant had two maxima at 1.5 and 3 nS (Fig. 5C), instead of 2 and 4 nS for the wild type (Fig. 2B). The double mutant ΔN2-12/ΔC269-283porin produced very noisy current recordings. The histogram of the single channel distribution of this mutant contained two maxima at 1 and 2.5 nS, which were even smaller than those measured for the C-terminal mutant (data not shown). Thus, the characteristics of both single mutants are present in the double mutant. It has been proposed that the N-terminal α-helix is directly involved in the voltage-dependent gating of mitochondrial porins (Peng et al., 30Peng S. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 123-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar; Thomas et al., 38Thomas L. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. Forte M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5446-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, the voltage dependence of the channels formed by the N-terminal deletion mutant porins was examined. ΔN2-12porin had a slightly reduced voltage dependence (Fig. 6) as compared with wild-type and His6porins, but it was still voltage-dependent. GU/GO was about 0.60 at 50 mV in comparison to 0.40-0.50 for the wild type (Table I). This effect was even stronger for porin channels lacking the whole N-terminal part (ΔN3-20porin); for these channels the apparent conductance at high potential was only about 30% smaller than at 10 mV (G50 mV/GO = 0.66). Whereas the pore size was altered by the C-terminal deletion, the gating of this mutant was not changed. A comparison of Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 demonstrates that the voltage-dependent closure was not influenced by the deletion at the C terminus. The double mutant ΔN2-12/ΔC269-283porin showed no voltage dependence in 1 M KCl (Fig. 6). Only slight closure (about 20%) was observed in low salt (50-150 mM KCl). The closure of the native, the His6porin, and the other mutant channels occurred already at lower voltages in less concentrated salt solutions (data not shown). This has been observed previously for other mitochondrial porins (Troll et al., 39Troll H. Malchow D. Müller-Taubenberger A. Humbel B. Lottspeich F. Ecke M. Gerisch G. Schmid A. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21072-21079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N and C termini of porin contain charged residues and thus could influence the ion selectivity of the channel. Therefore we investigated the effect of the deletion of these parts of the porin by performing selectivity measurements with the different deletion mutants. The ion selectivity of the ΔN2-12porin mutant was not significantly different from that of the wild-type protein, whereas the ΔN3-20porin mutant had a slightly higher cation selectivity, probably because more channels were in a closed, cation-selective configuration. The double mutant ΔN2-12/ΔC269-283porin displayed slight anion selectivity. It is possible that it was not capable of switching into a closed configuration and remained in an anion-selective, open state most of the time. In ΔC269-283porin the ion selectivity was not influenced as measured by the application of a salt gradient (Table I). The determination of the voltage dependence in 1 M LiCl or 1 M potassium acetate supported this observation (see Fig. 7). The difference between the GU/GO curves in various salts is caused by the different ion selectivity of the open versus the closed states of the porins (Ludwig et al., 25Ludwig O. Benz R. Schultz J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 978: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The curves in Fig. 7, A and B, are very similar, and thus the relative ion selectivity of the different states of the ΔC269-283porin and the native porin seem to be essentially the same. Previously, mutational analysis was only performed on yeast mitochondrial porin (Hamajima et al., 20Hamajima S. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Ono S. Sato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar; Blachly-Dyson et al., 4Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) due to the availability of molecular biology techniques for this organism. In this article, we show that N. crassa porin can be expressed as a His-tagged protein very efficiently in E. coli. This expression system is not only valuable for obtaining mutant porins but also for producing the large amounts of protein that are necessary for most spectroscopic techniques. Overexpression of eukaryotic porins from other sources, e.g. porin from pea amyloplasts 2K. Fischer, personal communication. and different porins from potato, 3U. K. Schmitz, personal communication. is also possible in E. coli. Functional reconstitution of the recombinant porins was only possible in the presence of ergosterol and detergent. Native mitochondrial porins co-purify with sterols, such as ergosterol in the case of N. crassa (Freitag et al., 17Freitag H. Neupert W. Benz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and cholesterol in the case of porin from bovine heart mitochondria (De Pinto et al., 12De Pinto V. Benz R. Palmieri F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that sterols play a crucial role in the reconstitution of sterol-free, water-soluble mitochondrial porins (Pfaller et al., 32Pfaller R. Freitag H. Harmey M.A. Benz R. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8188-8193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Popp et al., 34Popp B. Schmid A. Benz R.

Possibly the sterols shield exposed charges and thus facilitate insertion into the bilayer or formation of a structure competent for membrane insertion. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that sterols are particularly essential in low salt concentrations (50 or 150 mM KCl), whereas in high salt concentrations channel formation can occur in the absence of sterol, albeit less efficiently. All the biophysical properties of reconstituted recombinant mitochondrial porin from N. crassa expressed in E. coli were indistinguishable from porin isolated from mitochondria. We have shown in previous studies that reconstitution of other sterol-free, water-soluble porins does not always result in channels with the same properties as the native channels (Popp et al., 34Popp B. Schmid A. Benz R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3352-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Carbonara et al., 7Carbonara F. Popp B. Schmid A. Genchi G. Palmieri F. Benz R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the additional six histidinyl residues attached to the N terminus had no detectable influence on the biophysical properties, viz. single channel conductance, channel gating, and channel selectivity of mitochondrial porin from N. crassa. This result indicates that the His-tag is not localized in a crucial position of the channel structure, and thus the His-tagged fusion products can be directly compared with the native porin. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the N terminus undergoes transmembrane movement during potential-induced gating, as suggested by others (Peng et al., 30Peng S. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 123-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar; Thomas et al., 38Thomas L. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. Forte M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5446-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Such a model would predict that the gating characteristics would be altered in porin molecules containing an altered N terminus. According to secondary structure predictions and comparison to mitochondrial presequences, the N-terminal part of the protein may form an α-helix (Fig. 8) (Mihara and Sato, 28Mihara K. Sato R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; Kleene et al., 23Kleene R. Pfanner N. Pfaller R. Link T.A. Sebald W. Neupert W. Tropschug M.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 1265-1278PubMed Google Scholar). This was confirmed by CD spectroscopy of peptides with a sequence corresponding to residues 1-20 of the N. crassa mitochondrial porin (Guo et al., 18Guo X.W. Smith P.R. Cognon B. D'Arcangelis D. Dolginova E. Mannella C.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 114: 41-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the N-terminal α-helix is part of the channel wall (Blachly-Dyson et al., 4Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar; Peng et al., 30Peng S. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 123-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar; Thomas et al., 38Thomas L. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. Forte M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 144: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). According to our experiments neither the addition of a His-tag nor the deletion of residues 3-20 prevented the formation of normal-sized channels. If either of these alterations were within sequences that form the wall, they would be expected to disturb the channel structure or result in smaller channels. Therefore, we suggest that the N terminus of porin is exposed to either the intermembrane space or the cytosol. Surprisingly, the mitochondrial porin seems to be quite insensitive to the deletion of its C terminus. The resulting channels had decreased single channel conductance but otherwise unchanged biophysical properties. Secondary structure predictions suggest that the deleted region consists of one or two of the β-strands that build the channel wall (Fig. 8). Assuming that the mitochondrial porin is a water-filled channel with a wall built by 16 β-strands, one would expect that the removal of 2 strands would result in a decrease of the cross-section by 23% and thus a reduction of the single channel conductance by a similar value. This is in good agreement with what we observed. The ΔC269-283porin channels had a conductance of about 3 nS, about 25% smaller than that obtained for the wild-type channels. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the removal of only one β-strand by the C-terminal deletion would result in a similar decrease of the conductance, even though the cross-section would be decreased by only 12%. The reduction in single channel conductance could be greater than predicted because the model of an undisturbed passage of the ions through a cylindrical channel is only a rough approximation. When the cross-section of the channel is smaller, more interactions of the permeating ions with the channel wall have to be taken into account. Furthermore, we have to consider that the geometry of the channel may not be a perfect cylinder. The crystal structures of several bacterial porins indicate that the β-barrel of these proteins is closed by a salt bridge between the N- and C-terminal amino acids (Cowan et al., 10Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Gosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial porins are predicted to have a similar β-barrel structure (for a review see Benz, 2Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Thus, it is expected that this structure would be destabilized in the ΔC269-283 porin, if a similar interaction is required to close the pore. However, the deletion of the C-terminal 15 amino acids and the introduction of a glutamine residue at the C terminus does not prevent channel formation. Possibly, other interactions are responsible for closing the barrel structure. The ΔC269-283porin forms stable open channels and displays normal voltage-dependent gating. Thus, this region of the protein is not directly responsible for gating. Furthermore, it does not seem to play any role in the ion selectivity. The double mutant ΔN2-12/ΔC269-283porin is still able to form channels in the bilayer but has lost the gating behavior. This could be caused by a drastic disturbance of the overall channel structure. The channels are slightly anion-selective as expected from their lack of closing behavior. The N terminus itself seems to be important for overall channel stability, rather than being directly involved in gating. The gating characteristics of the ΔN-channels were only slightly different from those of the wild-type channels, suggesting that the structures responsible for the gating process are still intact in these mutants. The higher value of G50 mV/GO for the ΔN-mutants is not likely due to a different gating mechanism but to the altered conformation of the channels at the initial low potential. If a larger fraction of the channels is already in a closed configuration at the initial low potential (GO = 10 mV) in 1 M KCl, then the total amount of closure that can be achieved at higher voltages would be lower. Thus, we think that the N-terminal α-helix is not part of the voltage sensor and not crucial for the gating process as suggested by others (Peng et al., 30Peng S. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 123-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar; Thomas et al., 38Thomas L. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. Forte M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5446-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Instead, this part of the protein may play some role in the stabilization of the open state. Porins lacking part or all of the N-terminal sequence produce noisy single channels. The fluctuations observed in channels created by the ΔN-porins could be rapid transitions between the open and one or more closed conformations. The observation that the ΔN3-20 channels are more cation-selective than all others also argues for this possibility. If the open state is no longer stabilized, a greater proportion of the channels are in closed cation-selective states. We plan to measure the biophysical properties of individual channels formed by the different deletion mutants and compare them with those of individual wild-type channels. These measurements should allow the determination of the respective properties of each of the different states. The secondary structure predictions for mitochondrial porins suggest the presence of several large loops that should be exposed to the aqueous phase. One or more of these loops could perform the gating function (Benz, 2Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), as this has been similarly described for bacterial porins (Bauer et al., 1Bauer K. Struyvé M. Bosch D. Benz R. Tommassen J. J.

Possibly, the N-terminal part of the mitochondrial porin plays a role in the stabilization of the pore by interacting with these flexible loop(s). Using the E. coli expression system developed here, it is possible to test the function of the predicted loops in the gating process."

The protein samples were separated by 7.5% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) after boiling in Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) buffer. Western blots were performed as described by Towbin et al. (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). After the transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked overnight at 4°C with 5% skim milk in PBST (PBS and 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies in PBST containing 1% skim milk for 1 h each. The bands were visualized either by using a chromogenic reaction (0.6 mg/ml 3′3′-diaminobenzidine, 0.03% hydrogen peroxide, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.03% cobalt chloride) or by using the Amersham ECL kit (Amersham International Plc, UK). The DNA fragments corresponding to the CNBr peptides of Egr-1 were amplified from pUC-Egr-1 by the polymerase chain reaction (28Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar), using oligonucleotides complementary to 5′ and 3′ ends of each fragment as primers (Table I) and cloned downstream of the T3, T7 promoters in pCRScript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or the SP6 promoter in pSP65 (Promega, Madison, WI). The oligonucleotides had an EcoRI site at the 5′ end and a SalI site at the 3′ end to facilitate cloning into the vectors mentioned, although blunt end ligation was also used. The oligonucleotides were designed with an extra ATG codon at the 5′ oligonucleotide to ensure ease of visualization of the corresponding peptides on synthesis in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega). The peptides produced were analyzed by 16.5% SDS-PAGE by the procedure of Schägger and Von Jagow (29Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) except that [32P]orthophosphate was used at a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl) with appropriate protease and phosphatase inhibitors as listed above. Egr-1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates and the immunoprecipitates were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. The proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The Egr-1 band, located after an overnight exposure to x-ray film, was excised from the membrane, cut into small pieces, and used for CNBr digestion. CNBr (70 mg/ml in 70% formic acid) digestion was carried out overnight in the dark at room temperature. The supernatant containing digested peptides was transferred to a new tube and lyophilized. The dried peptides were washed with distilled H2O twice and then resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by 16.5% SDS-PAGE as described above. The assays were carried out as described previously (25Cao X. Mahendran R. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16949-16957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the binding buffer contained 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM HEPES, 12% glycerol, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 µM ZnCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. GST-Egr-1 fusion protein, F-1 used in this assay was eluted from glutathione beads with 20 mM reduced glutathione in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The glutathione-Sepharose beads containing GST-Egr-1 fusion proteins (50 µl) were resuspended in 100 µl of CKII assay buffer (200 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 µM ATP) in the presence of 2-5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was started by adding 1 unit of CKII (Promega) and incubating samples at 37°C for 30 min. The beads were washed with the Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF) four times and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. For phosphoamino acid analysis the gel was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the Egr-1 band was excised. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described by Boyle et al. (30Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) and Kamps (31Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The assay was essentially similar to that described by Jin and Burakoff (17Jin Y.J. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7769-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). CKII (50 units) was allowed to autophosphorylate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the reaction was stopped by adding 50 mM EDTA. The volume was increased to 1.0 ml with Triton buffer. The labeled kinase was precleared with Sepharose beads containing GST alone (50 µl) for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was removed after centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min and divided into five tubes containing the three Egr-1 deletions, an almost full-length Egr-1, and GST alone (50 µl each). The volume was again increased to 1.0 ml with Triton buffer, and the samples were mixed for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed three times with Triton buffer and once with TBS (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl), resuspended in Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and exposure to x-ray film. The transfection experiment was performed as described previously (25Cao X. Mahendran R. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16949-16957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with pCMV-Egr-1 (0-10 µg), pCMVCKII α-subunit (1-5 µg), pCMV-β-galactosidase (2 µg), and 5 µg of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid containing three Egr-1 binding sites upstream of a minimal fos promoter (25Cao X. Mahendran R. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16949-16957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant at 40 µg/plate using salmon sperm DNA. Cellular extracts were prepared and assayed for CKII activity as described by Heller-Harrison and Czech (32Heller-Harrison R.A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14435-14439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 µg of protein extracts were assayed at 37°C in a total reaction volume of 30 µl in CKII assay buffer containing 1 mM synthetic substrate peptide RRREEETEEE (33Kuenzel E.A. Krebs E.G. Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), 100 µM ATP, and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Controls consisted of assays done in the absence of substrate peptide and were subtracted as background. Reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 0.01 mM ATP and 0.4 N HCl prior to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The samples (15 µl) were spotted on Whatman P81 paper and washed in 0.5% H2PO4 three times for 10 min each, and the samples were counted. A kinase activity was found to be associated with Egr-1 immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of serum induced NIH 3T3 and MRC5 cells. This activity was determined to be similar to that of CKII based on its ability to utilize GTP during phosphorylation and its inhibition by heparin (data not shown). To further investigate this, Egr-1 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts by a monoclonal Egr-1 antibody. Conversely, CKII was also precipitated from the same nuclear extracts by a monoclonal CKII antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with a polyclonal antibody to the CKII α-subunit. The polyclonal antibody recognizes the CKII α-subunit immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal CKII antibody (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) as well as that co-immunoprecipitated with Egr-1 (lane 2). CKII was also co-immunoprecipitated with other Egr-1 polyclonal antibodies 588 and 5232, but not with preimmune serum (data not shown). The converse was also true when CKII was immunoprecipitated from cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts with a monoclonal CKII antibody, and the immunoblot was probed with an anti Egr-1 polyclonal antibody. Egr-1 was found to be associated with CKII immunoprecipitated from nuclear extract (Fig. 1B, lane 2), but not from the cytoplasmic sample (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The association of Egr-1 and CKII in vitro and the localization of CKII binding domain on Egr-1 was further investigated. A near full-length GST-Egr-1 fusion protein (amino acids 29-533) as well as three Egr-1 deletions coupled to GST were made (Fig. 1C). All the fusion proteins appeared as multiple bands on SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1D). This could be due to the degradation of Egr-1 products or could also be due to the multiple initiation sites. The near full-length GST-Egr-1 fusion protein, F-1, migrates as an about 100-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE, although theoretically it is only 82 kDa. This anomalous behavior is observed with cellular Egr-1 as well which runs at 80 kDa instead of its predicted molecular mass of 56 kDa (11Cao X. Mahendran R. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12991-12997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three Egr-1 deletions coupled to GST, C-2 (shorter C terminus fragment from amino acids 322-533), C-1 (longer C terminus Egr-1 fragment from amino acids 175-533), and N-1 (N terminus fragment of Egr-1 from amino acids 29-171) each had apparent molecular masses that matched their calculated molecular masses of 51, 66, and 43 kDa, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1, C and D. Purified CKII can be autophosphorylated on its β-subunit, and [γ-32P]ATP was used to tag CKII by autophosphorylation. The labeled CKII was incubated with the various GST-Egr-1 fusion proteins attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads. As shown in Fig. 1E, the association of CKII with Egr-1 was indicated by the presence of the 25-kDa phosphorylated β-subunit band with F-1, but not with GST alone. It was also found that CKII associated with C-2 as well as with C-1, but to a lesser extent. However, no association occurred with N-1. These results indicated that the CKII association domain within Egr-1 lies between amino acids 322 and 519. This region contains the three zinc fingers as well as the 5′ and 3′ nuclear localization signals as identified by Gashler et al. (13Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and Russo et al. (14Russo M.W. Matheny C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6858-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The last 14 amino acids at the C terminus of Egr-1 are unlikely to be involved in CKII binding as immunoprecipitation with 588 (an anti-Egr-1 antibody raised against the last 14 amino acids) did not disrupt the interaction between the two proteins (results not shown). In order to ascertain whether CKII phosphorylates Egr-1 in vitro, F-1 was incubated with CKII and 32P-labeled ATP. As shown in Fig. 2A, F-1 (lane 1) but not GST alone (lane 2) was phosphorylated by CKII. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on the phosphorylated F-1, and as shown in Fig. 2B the phosphorylation occurs more on serine than on threonine residues. To test this in vivo, Egr-1 was immunoprecipitated from platelet-derived growth factor-induced, [32P]orthophosphate-labeled, NIH 3T3 cells, and in this case strong phosphorylation on serine and weak phosphorylation on threonine residues were observed (Fig. 2C). The specificity of Egr-1 phosphorylation by CKII was investigated. Phosphorylation of the F-1 fusion protein by CKII was performed with different concentrations of the kinase. Increasing the amount of CKII resulted in a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of Egr-1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-5). It has been reported that CKII phosphorylates a specific substrate, RRREEETEEE (33Kuenzel E.A. Krebs E.G. Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and can also phosphorylate consensus sequences SXD/E, SXXD/E, or SXXXD/E (34Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation on Egr-1 is competitively inhibited by the CKII specific substrate peptide (lanes 6-9) as well as by FX, a peptide from Egr-1 containing an SXD consensus sequence (lanes 10-13) suggesting that Egr-1 phosphorylation by CKII is specific. To determine the CKII phosphorylation site(s) on Egr-1, a CNBr peptide map was generated. Theoretically, CNBr treatment of Egr-1 is predicted to produce six large peptides, separable on a polyacrylamide gel, as well as five small peptides lacking in kinase phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4A). The DNA fragments corresponding to the six large CNBr peptides (numbered 5-10) were first amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The amplified DNA was then cloned in vectors containing a SP6, T7, or T3 promoter. The [35S]methionine-labeled CNBr peptides were then synthesized in vitro with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and resolved by 16.5% SDS-PAGE. The peptides thus produced were in close agreement to their predicted molecular mass indicated in Fig. 4A (data not shown). In parallel to the above experiment, F-1 was phosphorylated by CKII, digested by CNBr, and resolved by 16.5% SDS-PAGE. Fragment 10 was strongly phosphorylated and fragment 7 moderately phosphorylated as compared to the other fragments (Fig. 4B, lane 1, 2-h exposure). The phosphorylation on fragments 5 and 8 was also observed on longer exposure of the autoradiograph (Fig. 4B, lane 2, 6-h exposure), whereas fragment 6 is detected only on overnight exposure (not shown). Some of the high molecular mass bands as shown by asterisks in Fig. 4B are due to incomplete CNBr digestion of Egr-1. CKII phosphorylation sites on Egr-1 in vitro were compared with those found in vivo from serum-induced, 32P-labeled NIH 3T3 cells. Egr-1 was immunoprecipitated from these cells and digested with CNBr. Fragments 5 and 10 were strongly phosphorylated, whereas fragment 7 was moderately phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Phosphorylation of fragments 6 and 8 was also observed only on longer exposure of the gel. Hence, serum-induced phosphorylation of fragments 5, 7, and 10 could be due to endogenous CKII, but the differential levels of phosphorylation on these fragments suggest that CKII is not the only kinase that phosphorylates Egr-1 in vivo. To further delineate the phosphorylation sites, CKII in vitro phosphorylated Egr-1 was digested with trypsin. Small peptides were separated on HPLC, and the fractions containing 32P-labeled peptides were subjected to microsequencing. The results indicate that these trypsin-generated peptides are parts of fragments 5, 6, 7, and 8 (see Fig. 4A (c)). The labeled peptides contain CKII sites (34Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar) which are S101XXD in fragment 5, T145XXXE in fragment 6, S194XD in fragment 7, and S299XD in fragment 8, all of which are potential sites for CKII phosphorylation. There are three CKII recognition sites (S376XXD, T389XE, and T516XXXD) in fragment 10. T389 and T516 are unlikely to be responsible for the strong phosphorylation of fragment 10 as phosphorylation on threonine is much weaker than that on serine. Thus S376 is likely to be the major phosphorylation site by CKII within fragment 10. The reason S376XXD could not be detected by this method, despite heavy phosphorylation in fragment 10, is because trypsin digestion resulted in a peptide around S376 of only four amino acids (NFS376R) which are not resolved by HPLC. We further confirmed phosphorylation of fragments 6, 8, and 10 by sequencing these peptides from excised gel sections (data not shown). Identification of the exact sites of CKII phosphorylation would require a site-directed mutational approach. The three zinc fingers of Egr-1 are located from amino acids 332-416. As fragment 10 contains the second and third zinc fingers, it is likely that phosphorylation on this fragment alters its DNA binding activity. To study the effect of CKII phosphorylation on Egr-1 DNA binding activity, GST-Egr-1 fusion protein (F-1) was phosphorylated with CKII prior to carrying out the DNA binding reaction in a gel mobility shift assay. The phosphorylation of Egr-1 by CKII resulted in a decrease in its DNA binding activity in a stoichiometric manner (Fig. 5, lanes 2-6). This decrease in DNA binding activity can be blocked competitively in a dose-dependent manner by the increasing concentrations of either CKII specific substrate peptide (Fig. 5, lanes 7-10) or by the FX peptide which has SXD as the CKII phosphorylation site (lanes 11-14). In order to study the effect of CKII phosphorylation on Egr-1 transcriptional activity in vivo, NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid comprised of three Egr-1 binding sites, an Egr-1 expression plasmid, pCMV-Egr-1, and a CKII expression plasmid, pCMVCKII (containing the CKII α-subunit). The CKII activity in untransfected and transfected cells was determined to ensure that the pCMVCKII plasmid produced active CKII in NIH 3T3 cells. A 1.6-fold increase in CKII activity was observed on transfecting cells with 2 µg of the pCMVCKII α-subunit (data not shown), which was in close agreement with previously reported results in COS-1 cells (32Heller-Harrison R.A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14435-14439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of cells with increasing concentrations of pCMV-Egr-1 results in an increase in transcriptional activity reflected by an increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (Fig. 6A, top panel). However, when the increasing concentrations (1, 2, and 5 µg) of CKII plasmids were co-transfected with egr-1, a corresponding decrease in egr-1 transcriptional activity was observed (Fig. 6A, lower panels). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells transfected with or without pCMVCKII in the presence of pCMV-Egr-1 and gel mobility shift analysis was performed using the Egr-1 binding site as a probe. A decrease in DNA binding activity was found when CKII was co-transfected with pCMV-Egr-1 (Fig. 6B, panel i, lane 2). Western analysis of these extracts showed that there was no change in the amount of Egr-1 protein present in each sample (Fig. 6B, panel ii). Thus, in the presence of the CKII plasmid there is a decrease in the DNA binding ability of Egr-1 in accordance with the in vitro mobility shift data (Fig. 5). To show that this decrease is a result of phosphorylation of the Egr-1 protein by CKII, transfected cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Egr-1 was immunoprecipitated with Egr-1 antibody, resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and autoradiography was performed. A 2-fold increase in Egr-1 phosphorylation was observed when cells were co-transfected with pCMV-Egr-1 in the presence of pCMVCKII as compared to that in the absence of pCMVCKII (Fig. 6C, panel i). Western blot analysis was performed on the same nitrocellulose membrane to confirm that there was no difference in the amount of Egr-1 protein (Fig. 6C, panel ii). To activate or repress transcription, transcription factors must locate to the nucleus, bind DNA, and interact with the basal transcription apparatus (35Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Accordingly, extracellular signals that regulate transcription factor activity may affect one or more of these processes. Most commonly regulation is achieved by phosphorylation of the transcription factor(s) which in turn modulate either its trans-activating activity or DNA binding activity (36Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Although Egr-1, a transcription factor, has been shown to play an important role in proliferating and differentiating cells, little is known of its function in relation to its phosphorylation status. In this report we show that Egr-1 is phosphorylated by the protein kinase CKII and that this has a negative effect on its DNA binding and transcription activities. Although the CKII phosphorylation pattern of Egr-1 does not exactly coincide with that of serum-induced Egr-1, it is possible that CKII is one of several kinases which phosphorylate and regulate Egr-1 function. As shown in Fig. 4A, the CKII phosphorylation sites on Egr-1 cover the regions of the protein important for its transcriptional activation (fragment 7), repressor binding (fragment 8), nuclear import, and DNA binding (fragment 10). The CKII sites present on these fragments are of S/TXD/E, S/TXXD/E, and S/TXXXD/E types (34Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that CKII attenuates Egr-1 DNA binding activity appears to be contradictory to earlier reports that Egr-1 DNA binding activity (25Cao X. Mahendran R. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16949-16957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is elevated after cell stimulation with growth factors. This could be due to a change in conformation arising from phosphorylation by other kinases beside CKII after serum induction. Furthermore, strong phosphorylation in the activation domain (fragment 5) of Egr-1 in vivo after serum induction might lead to an increase in its transcriptional activity. It has been reported that the CKII α-subunit alone is sufficient to increase CKII activity in vivo for several reasons. First, the α-subunit alone is moderately active without the β subunit (37Kikkawa U. Mann S.K. Firtel R.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5711-5723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Dobrowolska G. Boldyreff B. Issinger O.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1129: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Second, the α-subunit in nuclei is not bound to β but is complexed to other nuclear components (39Stigare J. Boddelmeijer N. Pigon A. Egyhazi E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 129: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Third, the β-subunit is synthesized in large excess over the α-subunit and only a small fraction of it contributes to the tetrameric holoenzyme complex (40Lüscher B. Litchfield D.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In our experiments, co-transfection of pCMVCKIIα and pCMV-Egr-1 results in a decrease in transcriptional activity in vivo which is possibly due to a decrease in DNA binding activity caused by CKII phosphorylation of the DNA binding fragment. Besides phosphorylating Egr-1, the association of CKII and Egr-1 could also induce further protein-protein interactions. As CKII is a tetrameric protein, it is possible that by anchoring different proteins to its four subunits it could promote interactions between diverse proteins. DNA topoisomerase II, which associates with CKII, is believed to participate in DNA transcription (as well as replication and recombination) as part of a multienzyme complex (41Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). CKII could thus be the building block for such a multienzyme complex which might possibly include a transcription factor. On the other hand, CKII has also been found to associate with the proteasome complex resulting in its degradation (42Ludemann R. Lerea K.M. Etlinger J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17413-17417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, CKII association with Egr-1 could be a prelude to degradation. This would correlate well with the fact that CKII phosphorylation of Egr-1 leads to a decrease in DNA binding and transcriptional activities. It is thus possible that Egr-1 transcriptional activity might be affected via its link with CKII by other CKII associated proteins. Our data show that CKII associates with Egr-1 and regulates its DNA binding and transcriptional activities by phosphorylation. Egr-1 is not the only DNA-binding protein that is inhibited by CKII. Other such proteins are c-Jun (19Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), c-Myb (43Lüscher B. Christenson E. Litchfield D.W. Krebs E.G. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1990; 344: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and serum response factor (44Manak J.R. de Bisschop N. Kris R.M. Prywes R. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 955-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is now necessary to study Egr-1 regulation in the context of CKII. A map of CNBr fragments of Egr-1 has been generated and the fragments phosphorylated by CKII have been identified. This will facilitate not only the further study of Egr-1 phosphorylation by CKII as well as other kinases but also aid in determining the phosphorylated residues on Egr-1 and lead to a better understanding of Egr-1 function in regulating cell growth and differentiation. We are grateful to Dr. Steven Sloan for the gift of the pCMVCKII plasmid and to Amgen Inc. for the Egr-1 monoclonal antibody. We thank Drs. Catherine J. Pallen and Kee Chuan Goh for critical reading of the manuscript and Francis Leong and Sock Yng Oh for photography."
https://openalex.org/W2071354308,"The cellular function of the MARCKS family of protein kinase C substrates is unknown. In this report, we present evidence that indicates a role for MacMARCKS, a member of the MARCKS family, in the integrin-dependent signal transduction pathways in macrophages. Using a dominant negative mutant of MacMARCKS, we showed that MacMARCKS participates in several integrin-dependent macrophage functions, including the phorbol ester-stimulated macrophage spreading, a process involving multiple integrins. The dominant negative mutant also blocks macrophage spreading on immune complex-coated surfaces, a process again requiring β2 integrin. More direct evidence of the role of MacMARCKS in the integrin-dependent pathway is the ablation of macrophage binding to complement iC3b-coated sheep erythrocytes by MacMARCKS mutant, suggesting an effect of this mutant on the avidity of complement receptor 3, a member of the β2 integrin family. To further evaluate the possible mechanism of MacMARCKS function, the integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was examined. Concomitant with the inhibition of macrophage spreading and rosette formation, MacMARCKS mutant also inhibits integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Furthermore, immunofluorescent microscopy data showed that MacMARCKS and paxillin colocalize in the membrane ruffles at the leading edge of the spreading cells, providing a potential site and opportunity for MacMARCKS to participate in the regulation of integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Together, these data strongly suggest that MacMARCKS plays a role in integrin-dependent signal transduction pathways in macrophages. The cellular function of the MARCKS family of protein kinase C substrates is unknown. In this report, we present evidence that indicates a role for MacMARCKS, a member of the MARCKS family, in the integrin-dependent signal transduction pathways in macrophages. Using a dominant negative mutant of MacMARCKS, we showed that MacMARCKS participates in several integrin-dependent macrophage functions, including the phorbol ester-stimulated macrophage spreading, a process involving multiple integrins. The dominant negative mutant also blocks macrophage spreading on immune complex-coated surfaces, a process again requiring β2 integrin. More direct evidence of the role of MacMARCKS in the integrin-dependent pathway is the ablation of macrophage binding to complement iC3b-coated sheep erythrocytes by MacMARCKS mutant, suggesting an effect of this mutant on the avidity of complement receptor 3, a member of the β2 integrin family. To further evaluate the possible mechanism of MacMARCKS function, the integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was examined. Concomitant with the inhibition of macrophage spreading and rosette formation, MacMARCKS mutant also inhibits integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Furthermore, immunofluorescent microscopy data showed that MacMARCKS and paxillin colocalize in the membrane ruffles at the leading edge of the spreading cells, providing a potential site and opportunity for MacMARCKS to participate in the regulation of integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Together, these data strongly suggest that MacMARCKS plays a role in integrin-dependent signal transduction pathways in macrophages. Integrin-dependent adhesion and spreading are essential to leukocyte binding to endothelium and extravasation of the endothelial layer in response to chemoattractants, endotoxins, and cytokines (for review, see Refs. 1Hynes R.O.

Many other leukocyte functions also depend on integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading; examples include leukocytes binding and engulfing immune complex-coated particles (6Brown E.J. Bohnsack J.F.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9472-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The importance of the integrin-mediated response is highlighted by a genetic deficient disease, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, in which patients are unable to express functional β2 integrin (for review, see Ref. 11Anderson D.C. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 175-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Leukocytes from these patients fail to adhere to, spread on, and extravasate the endothelial layer to the site of infection. A major intracellular event during integrin-dependent adhesion and spreading is the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation that leads to cytoskeleton rearrangement. One of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins among the potential cytoskeleton-associated targets is paxillin (12Turner C.E.

In leukocytes, the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is a β2 integrin-dependent process and has been implicated in a number of leukocyte functions including adhesion (19Graham I.L. Anderson D.C.

In integrin-dependent cell adhesion and spreading, the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is an essential step (reviewed in Ref. 2Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). For example, upon activation of PKC with phorbol esters, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), macrophages immediately spread out and flatten with the appearance of a fried egg (22Phaire-Washington L. Wang E. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Petty H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1012: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This PMA-stimulated process is integrin-dependent (24Danilov Y.N. Juliano R.L. J.

Activation of PKC is also a crucial step in most integrin-mediated cellular functions including leukocyte binding to the complements (27Wright S.D. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1149-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and immune complexes (8Graham I.L. Lefkowith J.B. Anderson D.C. Brown E.J. J.

Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC with phorbol esters also promotes enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin (19Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Fuortes M. Jin W.W. Nathan C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), consistent with the fact that PKC is involved in establishing focal adhesion (30Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how PKC is integrated into the integrin-dependent signal transduction pathway, nor do we know the candidates that are phosphorylated by PKC and transduce the phosphorylation signals. One of the major PKC substrates that has been extensively studied in leukocytes is the myristoylated membrane-associated protein named MacMARCKS (also known as F52 or MRP) (32Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Blackshear P.J. Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. J. Biol.

MacMARCKS is a member of the MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate) family of PKC substrates. MacMARCKS was so named because of its enrichment in endotoxin-activated macrophages (32Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). MacMARCKS is also a membrane-associated calmodulin-binding protein, and its calmodulin binding activity is regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation (32Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Blackshear P.J. Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 67: 227-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Both the phosphorylation site and calmodulin-binding sites are localized in a basic domain that is shared by the MARCKS family. This basic domain is therefore called the “effector domain” (32Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Blackshear P.J. Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13540-13546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite much speculation, the intracellular function of MARCKS and MacMARCKS has yet to be demonstrated and remains a focus in the field. We recently reported that MacMARCKS is involved in macrophage phagocytosis (36Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of how MacMARCKS functions in macrophage phagocytosis is not clear. In this report, we will show for the first time evidence suggesting that MacMARCKS is an essential component in integrin-dependent cellular functions. Hybridoma HB 226, which produces hamster anti-mouse β2 integrin (2E6); hybridoma HB197, which produces rat anti-mouse FcγR (2.4G2); and hybridoma TIB 112, which produces mouse IgM anti-sheep erythrocyte (S-S.3). J774.a1 cells were purchased from ATCC. Monoclonal anti-MHC I (M1/42) antibody was kindly provided by Dr. R. Steinman (Rockefeller University). Rabbit anti-BSA and goat anti-human serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratory. Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biochemicals. Rabbit polyclonal anti-MacMARCKS antiserum was affinity-purified as described (36Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Sheep erythrocytes were purchased from Ferrell Farms (Oklahoma City, OK). All other routine chemicals including PMA and poly-L-lysine were purchased from Sigma. J774 macrophage cells were plated on coverslips or in 60-mm dishes overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then treated for 25 min with 100 ng/ml of PMA. The cells were then fixed in 10% formalin for 15 min and were photographed under a Zeiss microscope. The images were digitized, and the cell-covered surface areas were measured on computer (Adobe Photoshop) and expressed in an arbitrary unit. Approximately 100 cells from each sample were randomly selected and measured. Cells in 60-mm dishes were lysed in 400 µl of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The removed culture medium was also centrifuged at 1000 rpm to recover any unadhered cells and then combined with the corresponding lysates. Paxillin was immunoprecipitated with 1.5 µg of anti-paxillin for 1 h followed by incubation with 50 µl of 50% protein G-Sepharose and 30 µl of 50% protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 2% BSA in the Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) containing 0.1% Tween-20 and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The filter was stripped and reprobed with anti-paxillin antibody. Complement iC3b-coated sheep erythrocytes (EiC3b) were prepared as described (37Wright S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 204-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, sheep erythrocytes were washed twice in saline, twice in EDTA/GVB (10 mM EDTA in GVB (5 mM veronal buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl with 0.05% gelatin)), and three times in DGVB++ (2.5 mM veronal buffer, pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl, 2.5% dextrose, 0.05% gelatin, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.15 mM CaCl2). To obtain IgM-coated erythrocytes (EIgM), 2 × 109 erythrocytes in EDTA/GVB were incubated with an equal volume of culture supernatant of hybridoma TIB 112 containing mouse anti-sheep erythrocyte IgM, 30 min at 37°C, and 30 min at 0°C. After three washes in DGVB++, EIgM were incubated with C5-deficient human serum (Sigma) for 60 min at 37°C and were ready to be used after three DGVB++ washes. Cells were plated on 60-mm culture dishes with a total of 106 cells and incubated with EiC3b (2 × 108) for 30 min followed by 25 min of PMA treatment. The cells were either fixed for photography or lysed for further analysis. The coverslips or dishes were coated according to the procedure described (37Wright S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 204-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, the coverslips or dishes were first soaked in 0.01% poly-L-lysine solution in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After removing excess poly-L-lysine by three PBS washes, the coverslips or dishes were treated with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min followed by three PBS washes. BSA was cross-linked to poly-L-lysine by soaking the dishes with BSA (1 mg/ml in PBS) for 3 h. The unreacted active glutaraldehyde group was quenched by a 30-min treatment of BSA, 0.1 M glysine. After two washes with PBS, the coverslips or dishes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-BSA IgG for 1 h at 37°C and were ready to be used after three PBS washes. The immune complex-coated surface was constructed as described above except human serum albumin and goat anti-human serum albumin were used instead. Cells on coverslips were fixed with 10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at 4°C. The cells were then permeabilized with acetone at −20°C for 5 min. MacMARCKS was visualized with affinity-purified rabbit anti-MacMARCKS antibody followed by Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as described (36Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To visualize paxillin, mouse anti-paxillin was applied followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. The subcellular localization of MacMARCKS and paxillin was documented on a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. We previously generated a J774 macrophage cell line expressing the effector domain deletion mutant of MacMARCKS (ED) (36Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), a dominant negative mutant that blocks macrophage phagocytosis of zymosan. To further evaluate the cellular function of MacMARCKS, we examined the effects of MacMARCKS mutation on integrin-dependent cellular functions because integrin activation is required for phagocytosis (38Buyon J.P. Abramson S.N. Philips M.R. Slade S.G. Ross G.D. Weissman G. Winchester R.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3156-3160PubMed Google Scholar). We first tested the effect of MacMARCKS mutant on PMA-stimulated macrophage spreading (22Phaire-Washington L. Wang E. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Petty H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1012: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), a process involving multiple integrins (24Danilov Y.N. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Shaw L.M. Messier J.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26Wallis W.J. Beatty P.G. Ochs H.D. Harlan J.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2323-2330PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to adding PMA, ED mutant cells and control FM cells (J774 cells transfected with wild type MacMARCKS) adhered to the dishes and appeared round and refractile. Upon adding PMA, FM control cells spread out and became extremely flat within 10 min (Fig. 2A). However, the ED mutant cells remained round and refractile (Fig. 2A), suggesting that MacMARCKS plays a role in PMA-stimulated and integrin-dependent cell spreading. The degrees of spreading were measured from an average of 100 cells and presented in terms of cell-covered surface area. FM control cells covered an area approximately 7 times larger than did ED mutant cells or unstimulated control cells (Fig. 2B). Fc receptor-mediated neutrophil spreading on immune complex-coated surface depends on β2 integrin (8Graham I.L. Lefkowith J.B. Anderson D.C. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the effect of MacMARCKS mutation on J774 macrophage spreading on this surface. The FM control J774 cells adhered to and spread out on this surface within 15 min after its addition to this surface, showing a typical fried egg shape (Fig. 3A). But ED mutant cells failed to spread despite weakly adhering to this surface (Fig. 3A). The average cell-covered surface area of spread FM control cells was approximately 7 times larger than that of unspread ED mutant cells (Fig. 3B). Both anti-FcR antibody (2.4G2) and anti-β2 integrin antibody (2E6) blocked J774 cells spreading on this surface, indicating that it is indeed a FcR- and β2 integrin-dependent process (data not shown). More direct evidence that MacMARCKS participates in integrin-dependent macrophage function was obtained by examining integrin interaction with its ligand. Macrophages form rosettes with complement iC3b-coated sheep erythrocytes (EiC3b) through its complement receptor 3 (αmβ2, CR3), a member of the β2 integrin family. To determine the effect of MacMARCKS mutant on integrin-mediated ligand binding, EiC3b were incubated with FM control and ED mutant cells for 30 min. No rosettes formed in the absence of PMA (Fig. 4A). Upon adding PMA for 25 min, all FM control cells were heavily rosetted with EiC3b (Fig. 4A). In contrast, ED mutant cells showed minimum binding to EiC3b even with PMA stimulation (Fig. 4A). Control J774 cells showed a binding index (bound EiC3b/100 J774 cells) approximately 12 times higher than that of ED mutant cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting integrin αmβ2 function is defect. Thus, MacMARCKS is likely to an be essential component in integrin activation. One of the major signal transduction events of integrin activation is the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8902) Google Scholar, 2Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, integrin activation leads to an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in a β2 integrin-dependent manner (19Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Fuortes M. Jin W.W. Nathan C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the possible mechanism of MacMARCKS function in integrin-dependent cellular events, we examined whether the integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was disrupted by MacMARCKS mutation and whether it correlates with the physiological phenotype described above. Paxillin was immunoprecipitated with anti-paxillin antibody from cells treated with the assays described above. The tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. While PMA stimulated macrophage spreading, it also stimulated an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in FM control cells, whereas only a trace amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was detected in ED mutant cells after PMA stimulation (Fig. 5A), consistent with its incapability of spreading. Furthermore, when J774 cells-EiC3b rosettes were formed upon PMA treatment, an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was also detected in FM control cells (Fig. 5B). Without PMA, the presence of EiC3b alone was not sufficient to induce the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin (Fig. 5B) or the rosette formation (Fig. 4A) in FM control cells. Likewise, the ED mutant cells did not show any tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin even in the presence of PMA (Fig. 5B). Previous reports have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin induced by immune complex-coated surface is a β2 integrin-dependent process in neutrophils (19Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Fuortes M. Jin W.W. Nathan C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our experiments showed that it is also true in J774 macrophages, because antibody against β2 integrin (2E6) can block J774 cells from spreading on immune complex-coated surface (data not shown) and paxillin phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). In addition, our experiments showed that inhibiting PKC with staurosporin also blocked the spreading on the immune complex-coated surface (data not shown) as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin (Fig. 5C), further suggesting involvement of PKC in macrophage response to immune complex as previously suggested (39Zheleznyak A. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12042-12048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of the ED mutant of MacMARCKS also abolished the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin induced by immune complex-coated surface (Fig. 5C), again correlating with its incapability of spreading on this surface (Fig. 3A). Using immunofluorescent microscopy, we then examined the subcellular localization of MacMARCKS and paxillin during cell spreading. In J774 cells spreading on the immune complex-coated surface, both MacMARCKS and paxillin were concentrated and colocalized at the membrane ruffles at the leading edge of spreading cells (Fig. 6). Such a colocalization provides MacMARCKS a potential opportunity and subcellular site to participate in the regulation of paxillin phosphorylation. Staining of both proteins was also seen in vesicular structures at the perinuclear regions, which may represent a prestored or recycled population. Interestingly, once paxillin appeared in the typical podosome structure, MacMARCKS no longer colocalized with paxillin in these structures (Fig. 6). The J774 cells on BSA-coated control surface remained round, and no specific subcellular localization of either proteins was seen with confocal microscopy (data not shown). Despite much speculation, the cellular function of the MARCKS family of PKC substrate remains unknown. In this report, we present data for the first time that place MacMARCKS in the integrin-dependent signal transduction pathways in macrophages. Using a dominant negative mutant of MacMARCKS, we show that MacMARCKS participates in several integrin-dependent macrophage functions. Examples include the inhibition of PMA-stimulated macrophage spreading, a process involving multiple integrins (24Danilov Y.N. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Shaw L.M. Messier J.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26Wallis W.J. Beatty P.G. Ochs H.D. Harlan J.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2323-2330PubMed Google Scholar). It also blocks macrophage spreading on immune complex-coated surface, a process requiring β2 integrin (8Graham I.L. Lefkowith J.B. Anderson D.C. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More direct evidence is the ablation of macrophage binding to EiC3b, showing MacMARCKS mutation affects CR3 avidity, a member of β2 integrin family. To further investigate the mechanism of how MacMARCKS participates in integrin-dependent cellular functions, we showed that integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is also abolished by the MacMARCKS mutant. Thus, our results suggest that MacMARCKS is involved in the signal transduction pathway that results in integrin activation and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. The effect of MacMARCKS on integrin-dependent cell spreading is consistent with our previous report that MacMARCKS is required for phagocytosis (36Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), because the activation of integrin and the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin are both involved in phagocytosis as well (19Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The close relationship between MacMARCKS and paxillin was further illuminated by the observation that MacMARCKS colocalizes with paxillin in the membrane ruffles at the leading edge of spreading macrophages, providing an opportunity and a potential subcellular site for MacMARCKS to participate in the regulation of paxillin phosphorylation. Interestingly, MacMARCKS colocalized with paxillin only in the membrane ruffles, not in the established podosome structure where paxillin appears in punctate structure, suggesting that MacMARCKS may only transiently colocalize with paxillin during initial formation of focal contacts. Unfortunately, we do not yet know the subcellular localization of mutant MacMARCKS because of the lack of mutant-specific antibody. An obvious question raised by these results is whether MacMARCKS affects integrin activation first, which then ultimately affects tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and cytoskeleton rearrangement such as spreading (outside-in signaling), or whether MacMARCKS affects tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin first, which then regulates cytoskeleton and ultimately affects the receptor avidity on the surface (inside-out signaling). Currently, we do not have evidence to support either possibility. We favor the hypothesis that MacMARCKS may affect the cytoskeleton first and then the integrin avidity, because both MARCKS (40Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) and MacMARCKS (32Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) are cytoskeleton-associated proteins. One of the mechanisms by which cytoskeleton may affect receptor activation is the receptor clustering, which is often required for receptor activation. One well illustrated example is the acetylcholine receptor for which one of the required components for its clustering on the surface of the cells was shown to be a 43-kDa myristoylated cytoskeletal protein. Coexpression of this 43-kDa protein and acetylcholine receptor reconstitute the formation of receptor patches (41Phillips W.D. Kopta C. Blount P. Gardner P.D. Steinbach J.H. Merlie J.P. Science. 1991; 251: 568-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the case of β1 integrins, clustering is also an essential process for the full activation of the integrin itself and aggregation of cytoskeleton components (42Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Integrin activation is a cytoskeleton-dependent process (43Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), and the cytoskeleton is suggested to affect the clustering of surface integrins, essential for the full activation of integrins (for review see Ref. 3Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). MacMARCKS is required in PMA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in macrophages. We therefore favor the hypothesis that MacMARCKS may regulate paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation through which MacMARCKS affects the clustering and avidity of the surface integrin to interact with matrix and thus affects cell spreading.

Brown (Washington University) for an invaluable discussion during a Gordon Conference on the similarity between MacMARCKS mutant cells and β2 integrin-deficient cells from leukocyte adhesion deficiency patients.

The translation initiation site, ATG, is located in exon II. Primer extension and S1 nuclease analyses showed the presence of three transcription initiation (Ti) sites: Ti I, Ti II, and Ti III. The Ti I site is mapped to the beginning of the untranslated exon I and preceded by a promoter with recognizable TATA and CAAT boxes. The Ti II and Ti III sites are located in intron I, at 60 and 49 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation site ATG in exon II, respectively. These two Ti sites are preceded by four putative Sp1 boxes, but lack TATA and CAAT boxes. Analysis of luciferase reporter gene expression in transient transfection assays confirmed the existence of two promoters. A 200-base pair 5′-flanking region, which has strong promoter activity comparable with that of the CMV promoter, is considered human fatty-acid synthase promoter I. In a wild-type human fatty-acid synthase-luciferase construct, in which promoter I and intron I are present in their natural configuration, the reporter gene activity is only 1% of that of promoter I. Deletion analysis showed the existence of promoter II, which is located in intron I immediately upstream of the Ti II site. The strength of promoter II is approximately 1/15th of that of promoter I in transient transfection assays. Further analysis of reporter gene constructs showed that promoter II inhibited the reporter gene activity of the wild-type construct that contained promoter I and intron I and that the spatial separation of the two promoters is important for this inhibition. A model is proposed based on the possibility that the assembly of transcription complexes on promoter II creates a “roadblock” and reduces the overall expression of the fatty-acid synthase gene by interfering with the progression of transcription from promoter I.

Although people are becoming conscious of limiting their intake of dietary fat, our fundamental knowledge of the complex set of interactions between dietary intake, hormonal stimulation, and gene regulation of the de novo synthesis of fatty acids in humans is very limited. Long-chain fatty acids are the major constituents of fats and lipids and play an important role in obesity and hyperlipidemia. In humans, as in other animals, fatty acids are either derived from food or synthesized de novo from acetyl-CoA by means of a complex set of reactions that are catalyzed by two key multifunctional enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1The abbreviations used are: ACCacetyl-CoA carboxylaseFASfatty-acid synthaseT3triiodothyronineTitranscription initiation siteHPRThypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. and fatty-acid synthase (FAS; Refs. 1Wakil S.J.

ACC, a biotin enzyme, catalyzes the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. FAS catalyzes the synthesis of palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA in the presence of NADPH (1Wakil S.J.

Little is known about the regulation of FAS in humans. There is, however, ample evidence that the synthesis of FAS in animals is a well regulated process that is affected by diet and hormones at all stages of life, even during neonatal development and differentiation. A fat-free diet induces the synthesis of FAS and, consequently, an increase in the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids (2Wakil S.J. Joshi V.C. Stoops J.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Starvation or diabetes mellitus represses the expression of the FAS gene. In fact, a dietary cycle of starvation and refeeding of a fat-free diet has been used routinely to enrich FAS in animal tissues, especially for the purposes of isolating the enzyme from liver tissue (1Wakil S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). FAS levels are controlled by the rate of transcription and the stability of its mRNA (3Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M.

Hormones, such as triiodothyronine (T3) and insulin, affect the expression of the genes of many lipogenic enzymes, including FAS (8Stapleton S. Mitchell D. Salati L. Goodridge A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18550-18554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), adding T3 to the culture medium caused a 2-4-fold increase both in the FAS mRNA level and in enzyme activity, whereas adding insulin alone had little or no effect. When T3 and insulin were added together, however, the response to T3 was amplified by 2-fold (8Stapleton S. Mitchell D. Salati L. Goodridge A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18442-18446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the excess T3 produced in hyperthyroidism reduced the levels of FAS transcription (10Kameda K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 144: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The sequences of the regulatory regions in the rat and goose FASs contain several potential transcriptional regulatory elements, including hormone response elements (11Kameda K. Goodridge A.G. J.

Recently, two different insulin response elements were identified in the regulatory region of rat FAS; one lies within a DNase hypersensitive region (14Wolf S. Hofer G. Beck K. Roder K. Schweizer M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the other overlaps a CAAT box region (15Moustaid N. Beyer R. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of the rat FAS reporter gene by diet and hormones has also been demonstrated by using transgenic mice (16Soncini M. Yet S.-F. Moon Y. Chun J.Y. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30339-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CAAT box upstream of the TATA box with a CATGTG motif in the rat FAS sequence is an E-box sequence and serves as an insulin response element (15Moustaid N. Beyer R. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a binding site of upstream stimulatory factor (17Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is generally presumed that FAS is highly repressed in humans (20Shrago E. Spennetta T. Gordon E.

It has been shown, however, that progestin increases and antiprogestin (RU486) decreases the transcription of FAS mRNA in the mammary tumor cell line MCF-7. In addition, RU486 stabilizes FAS mRNA (23Chalbos D. Galtier F. Emiliani S. Rochefort H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8220-8224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Semenkovich et al. (24Semenkovich C.F. Coleman T. Goforth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6961-6970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the 2-5-fold increase in the FAS mRNA level in HepG2 cells that was induced by glucose occurred because of the increased stability of FAS mRNA. We have shown recently that although FAS mRNA is present in several human tissues at low levels, it is most abundant in brain, liver, and lung tissues (25Jayakumar A. Tai M.-H. Huang W.-Y. Al-Feel W. Hsu M. Abu-Elheiga L. Chirala S.S. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8695-8699Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific distribution of human FAS mRNA suggests that the human FAS gene is regulatable. Although the hormonal regulation of the rat and goose FAS genes is being studied, information on the human FAS gene and its regulation will be more relevant to our long-term goal of studying the involvement of long-chain fatty acids in human diseases. To study the regulation of the human FAS gene, we cloned and sequenced a 6-kb genomic DNA fragment that contained the 5′-flanking region of the human FAS gene and mapped the transcription initiation sites. In this communication, we report the molecular cloning of the gene, the identification of its two promoters, and the analysis of the promoter functions. In addition, we report that transcription from the upstream promoter is blocked by the intron promoter, resulting in reduced overall expression.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7778-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 106 plaques were screened. All positive clones were purified by repeated screening. The phage DNA from the purified clones was isolated by using standard methods (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Among the positive clones, clone A had an EcoRI fragment (AE6), approximately 6-kb in length, that hybridized the probe. This fragment was subcloned into pBluescript KS(+) plasmid and sequenced with the vector primers and with primers derived from the 485-bp human FAS cDNA sequence (25Jayakumar A. Tai M.-H. Huang W.-Y.

Analysis of the sequence showed that clone A contained the genomic DNA sequence coding for the 5′-half of the Try3-27 cDNA. Comparing the partial restriction map of clone A and DNA fragment AE6 with that of the human FAS cosmid clone 43D6 isolated by Dr. Arumugam Jayakumar in our laboratory (25Jayakumar A. Tai M.-H.

The appropriate oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% acrylamide urea gel. The longest oligonucleotide was cut from the gel, was eluted with a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 M NaCl (pH 8), and was purified. The radioactive oligonucleotide (5 × 104 cpm) was hybridized to 50 µg of total RNA for 4 h at 68°C in 20 µl of hybridization buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 30 units of RNAguard (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The DNA-RNA hybrids were recovered by precipitating them with ethanol, and the cDNA synthesis was performed as described previously (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Appropriate double-stranded DNA fragments with complementary DNA strands labeled at the 5′-end were used as S1 probes. The S1 probes (1 × 104 cpm) were denatured, hybridized to 50 µg of total RNA at 68°C, and treated with 600 units of S1 nuclease according to the method of Berk and Sharp (29Berk A.J. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1977; 12: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). The hybridization products were analyzed on an 8% sequencing gel together with a known sequence ladder. The human FAS-luciferase reporter gene plasmids were constructed by using a pXP1 luciferase expression vector (30Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 453-456Google Scholar) provided by Dr. Gretchen Darlington of Baylor College of Medicine. Human FAS gene fragments were generated by digesting the DNA with either restriction enzymes or Bal-31 exonuclease (31Poncz M. Solowiejczyk D. Ballantine M. Schwartz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4298-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The Bal-31-processed DNA fragments were blunt-ended by using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and were cloned upstream of the luciferase gene in vector pXP1. The human FAS promoter I-luciferase construct, LC9, contained a 926-bp FAS gene fragment (nucleotides −870 to +56). In this construct, the 56 bp of exon I became the 5′-untranslated region of the luciferase mRNA. To test whether an intron promoter exists for transcripts initiated at sites Ti II (nucleotide +1602) and Ti III (nucleotide +1613), a 260-bp KpnI-PstI human FAS DNA fragment (nucleotides +1394 to +1653) containing the 3′-end of intron I was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene of vector pXP1 together with a 17-bp PstI-HindIII adapter containing the natural 3′ splice site of human FAS (LC1). A 3.3-kb KpnI-KpnI human FAS fragment (nucleotides −1906 to +1394) immediately upstream of KpnI (nucleotide +1394) was isolated from AE6 and cloned at the unique KpnI site in LC1, producing the construct LC20. LC20 was further modified to contain the promoter I region identical to that of LC9 by deleting a 1-kb SstI fragment from the 5′-end to generate LC3. LC3 contained promoter I, exon I, intron I, and the natural intron I splice sites. All the reporter gene constructs we created use the translation initiation codon ATG of the luciferase gene. The human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 was maintained in minimal essential medium and Waymouth's MAB medium (3:1), the human breast cancer T47D cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 medium, and the human fibroblast cell line HT10-80 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 100 milliunits/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. The medium was replaced with fresh medium twice a week and split 1-10 every week. The supercoiled plasmid DNA used for transfection was prepared according to the modified alkaline lysis method and was purified by two rounds of CsCl density gradient centrifugation (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The cells were plated at a density of approximately 5 × 104 cells/cm2 and were transfected with 0.2 µg/cm2 plasmid DNA by using either a calcium phosphate transfection kit or a LipofectAMINE transfection kit. To normalize the efficiencies of transfection, CMV-β-gal DNA was cotransfected with the test plasmids at 1/10 the amount of test DNA. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were washed with culture medium. When the calcium phosphate transfection procedure was used, the cells were treated with culture medium containing 10% glycerol for 5 min before washing. The cells were fed fresh media and 48 h later were harvested and lysed. The luciferase activity was measured in relative light units by using an Enhanced Luciferase assay kit and a Monolight 2010 Luminometer. The β-galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 403Google Scholar, 33Chirala S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10232-10236Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To normalize the transfection efficiencies, the luciferase activity was expressed as a ratio of relative light units to the β-galactosidase activity obtained from the same extract. The luciferase activities obtained from the two different transfection methods were normalized by using the same constructs in both procedures. RNA isolation (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62721) Google Scholar) was performed as described. DNA sequencing (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A 6-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the 5′-flanking region of the human FAS gene was isolated and cloned into pBluescript KS(+) vector, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This 6-kb EcoRI DNA fragment, called AE6 (Fig. 1), was digested with PstI and SmaI restriction enzymes, and the fragments were subcloned into pBluescript KS(+) plasmid and sequenced with vector primers and with the primers generated from the sequences obtained (Fig. 1). We overlapped the sequences of the subclones by sequencing DNA fragment AE6 with appropriate internal primers. The overall sequence is very rich in GC and had to be sequenced at 65°C by using Bst® DNA polymerase and 7-deaza-dGTP in order to eliminate secondary structural artifacts. Comparing the sequence of AE6 with the sequences of the human FAS cDNA (25Jayakumar A. Tai M.-H. Huang W.-Y. Al-Feel W. Hsu M. Abu-Elheiga L. Chirala S.S. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DNA Seq. 1992; 2: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of a putative 5′-untranslated exon and two translated exons (Fig. 1). The translation initiation codon ATG is located in exon II. Only a portion of the sequence of AE6 is shown in Fig. 2. The transcription initiation sites (Fig. 2) were later determined by primer extension and S1 mapping studies. The sequences of the human FAS exons II and III are, respectively, 88 and 90% identical to the sequences of the corresponding rat FAS exons. Both the rat and goose FAS genes have untranslated exon I sequences (Fig. 2; Refs. 11Kameda K. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 419-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Amy C.M.

DNA Seq. 1992; 2: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The untranslated exon I of the human and rat FASs are relatively less conserved, sharing about 65% identity. Interestingly, there is about 90% identity between the human FAS and the rat FAS throughout a region of 170 bp in the 5′-flanking region (Fig. 2), which contains four Sp1 consensus sequences (37Briggs M. Kadonaga J. Bell S. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar) and a consensus sequence of the glucocorticoid response element (38Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6230) Google Scholar). The putative insulin response sequence overlapping the CAAT box is the binding site of upstream stimulatory factor 1 (9Moustaid N. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18550-18554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 19Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The sequence is also conserved in the goose FAS gene (11Kameda K. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 419-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three FAS sequences even have the same TATA box and CAAT sequences (Fig. 2). To prove the existence of the putative untranslated exon I in human FAS and to map the transcription initiation site(s), primer extension experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide 1 located in exon II, and oligonucleotides 2 and 3, located in the putative exon I (Fig. 3B), were synthesized and used as primers. Based on the location of these oligonucleotides and the consensus sequences of the intron-exon junction, we expected the extension product of oligonucleotide 1 to be 31 nucleotides longer than that of oligonucleotide 2, and the product of oligonucleotide 2 to be 43 nucleotides longer than that of oligonucleotide 3. When total RNA from HepG2 cells was used, the longest cDNAs obtained with oligonucleotides 1, 2, and 3 were 150, 119, and 76 nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 5, and 8). The lengths of these primer extension products determined the beginning of exon I. In addition, the 150-nucleotide-extended oligonucleotide 1 from exon II confirmed the assignment of the 3′-end of exon I and 5′-end of exon II, which were based on the consensus sequences of the intron-exon junction. When total RNA from T47D cells was used with oligonucleotide 1, however, we could only detect a faint extension product of 150 nucleotides. Moreover, there were significant amounts of new extension products (Fig. 3A, lane 3) that were from 74 to 85 nucleotides in length. These additional extension products were also detected with oligonucleotide 1 in RNA from HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A, lane 2). When oligonucleotides 2 and 3 were used with T47D RNA, no extension products were observed (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 9). These results suggested that there may be additional transcription initiation sites located in intron I at positions +1602 and +1613, which are, respectively, 60 and 49 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon ATG (Fig. 2). The ladders in the lanes in Fig. 3 that contain extension products were probably generated by premature termination of reverse transcriptase because of the high GC content. The results obtained from the primer extension experiments were confirmed by S1 mapping analyses. To map the transcription initiation site at the beginning of exon I, a 115-bp double-stranded DNA fragment was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using AE6 DNA as a template. Oligonucleotide 4 is located in the 5′-flanking region of exon I, and the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 3 is located in exon I (Fig. 4B). The 115-bp PCR product that contained 39 bp of the 5′-nontranscribed region and 76 bp of the exon I sequence was denatured and hybridized to total RNA from HepG2 cells. S1 mapping analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected from the results of the primer extension experiments, a 76-bp protected fragment was detected when total RNA from HepG2 cells was used (Fig. 4A, lane 2), thus confirming the assignment of the transcription initiation site Ti I to the beginning of exon I, as shown in Fig. 2. To confirm the alternative transcription initiation sites present in intron I upstream of exon II, we generated a 300-bp double-stranded S1 probe in the 5′-flanking region of exon II (Fig. 4D). The probe contained 262 bp of intron I and 38 bp of exon II (nucleotides +1393 to +1692). When we used total RNA from T47D cells and from HepG2 cells (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 2), we observed three RNA-protected DNA probe fragments that were, respectively, 91, 80, and 38 nucleotides in length. The two longer fragments were generated from RNAs beginning at nucleotides +1602 and +1613, respectively. As predicted (Fig. 4D), these results confirmed those of the primer extension studies described above and indicated the existence of an intron promoter. When the full-length human FAS mRNA that contained exon I hybridized to the DNA probe that"

In neutrophils, GM-CSF induced time-dependent electrophoretic mobility shifts in immunoreactive p90rsk. Although these shifts suggested changes in the phosphorylation status of the molecule, a kinase assay with whole cell lysates detected minimal (1.5-fold) increments in enzymatic activity. Only immunoprecipitation followed by immune complex kinase assay or in-gel kinase assay performed against the RSK substrate RRLSSLRA evidenced an increase in p90rsk activity (3.4-fold). p90rsk was also detected in the GM-CSF-dependent erythroleukemia cell line TF-1. Normally cultured, cytokine-supplemented cells did not respond to further GM-CSF stimulation. However, the activity of p90rsk in cytokine-starved cells increased dramatically in response to short term GM-CSF challenge. This effect was readily observable in total cell lysates (6.6-fold increase over controls) and was paralleled by changes in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (a substrate of p90rsk). Thus, p90rsk is present in mature hemopoietic cells, but the extent of the enzymatic response to GM-CSF is significantly lower than that seen in proliferative cells.

INTRODUCTIONThe granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), 1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSFgranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factorMAPmitogen-activated proteinFCSfetal calf serumFMLPfMet-Leu-PheMBPmyelin basic protein. like other related cytokines, has multiple functions in cells of the immune system, namely, proliferation, differentiation, end-cell activity, and regulation of apoptosis. GM-CSF, as a growth factor for immature hematopoietic cells, plays a crucial role in the commitment of bone marrow stem cells, directing the proliferation and differentiation into specific lineage precursors and enhancing their survival (1Metcalf D. Science. 1985; 229: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 2Golde D.W. Gasson J.C. Gallin J.I. Boldstein J.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates.

Additionally, GM-CSF, as an stimulatory agent of terminally differentiated hematopoietic cells, is able to potentiate the activation of mature phagocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages, playing an important role in host defense (4Cannistra S.A. Griffin J.D. Semin. Hematol. 1988; 25: 173-188PubMed Google Scholar). In the neutrophil, GM-CSF is able to enhance cell chemotaxis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, expression of membrane antigens, phagocytosis, degranulation of lytic enzymes, and release of superoxide anions directed toward invading microbes (5Gomez-Cambronero J. Sha'afi R.I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 314: 35-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).In spite of lacking a tyrosine catalytic domain (6Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), the GM-CSF receptor is still able to induce rapid phosphorylation of multiple cell proteins on tyrosine residues in various cell types of the myeloid lineage, including the neutrophil (7Berkow R.L.

In fact, p42MAPK (ERK-2) is one of the proteins that undergoes the largest change in its tyrosyl phosphate content upon GM-CSF or fMet-Leu-Phe (chemotactic factor) treatment in the neutrophil.As it has been previously shown, MAP kinases p42, p44, and p54, become active by dual Thr/Tyr phosphorylation in response to mitogenic stimuli (23Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12721-12727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) demonstrated that p42MAPK isolated from Xenopus oocytes was able to in vitro phosphorylate the ribosomal S6 kinase p90rsk in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. p90rsk, first named S6KII, was initially described in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (26Blenis J. Erikson R.L. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3441-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and was purified from Xenopus eggs (27Erikson R.L. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 350-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as murine and avian cell lines (28Alcorta D.A. Crews C.M. Sweet L.J. Bakston L. Jones S.W. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2413-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been extensively studied in mitosis (30Thomas G. Cell. 1992; 68: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). p90rsk is itself a mitogen-activated Ser/Thr kinase. In vitro it can phosphorylate synthetic peptides like RRLSSLRA, which was modeled after the phosphorylation site of S6 protein of the mammalian small (40 S) ribosomal subunit (31Ahn N.G. Weil J.E. Chan C.P. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ahn N.G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11495-11501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein S6 has been long known to become the major phosphoprotein found in mammalian ribosomes of cells stimulated with growth factors (33Wool I.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 719-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this protein, which occurs during mitogen and growth factor activation of cells, could facilitate protein synthesis (34Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6007-6010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sturgill T.W. Wu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).We undertook this study firstly to ascertain whether p90rsk was present in mature hematopoietic cells. Because we were able to detect a significant amount of p90rsk in neutrophils, we further studied whether the kinase enzymatic activity was regulated upon cell stimulation with GM-CSF and how this effect compared with the situation in proliferating hematopoietic cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials, Antibodies, and Cell LinesrhGM-CSF and rhTNF-α were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); lipopolysaccharide was from Difco (Detroit, MI); fMet-Leu-Phe, PKA inhibitor (rabbit sequence) TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD, goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule agarose beads), and myelin basic protein were from Sigma; diisopropyl fluorophosphate was from Aldrich; Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Millipore Corporation (Bedford, MA); electrophoresis chemicals were from Bio-Rad; [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.; ion exchange chromatography cellulose phosphate paper was purchased from Whatman (Hillsboro, OR); anti-MAP kinase (p42, erk2), anti-pp90rsk, anti-GTPase-activating protein antibodies (directed against a peptide containing amino acid residues 171-448 of human GTPase-activating protein), RSK peptide (RRRLSSLRA), and myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide (APRTPGGRR) were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); the cervix epithelioid carcinoma HeLa cell lines were purchased from The American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD); the cytokine-dependent erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 was a generous gift of Dr. T. Kitamura, University of Tokyo, Japan; tissue culture material was from Becton Dickinson (Oxnard, CA) and Costar (Cambridge, MA).Isolation of Human Neutrophils, Cell Culture, and Thymidine IncorporationHuman neutrophils were isolated from blood of healthy donors and separated on a Ficoll/Hypaque gradient according to the method of English and Anderson (36English D. Anderson B.R. JImmunolMethods. 1974; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). TF-1 erythroleukemia cells were cultured as described previously (37Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.-F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, 2 mML-glutamine, and gentamicin (50 µg/ml) in the presence of GM-CSF (150 pM) at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Prior to some studies, the TF-1 cells were starved from cytokine maintenance by washing twice in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% FCS without GM-CSF. The cells were resuspended at 5 × 104 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS and incubated for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. At the time of the experiment both cytokine-starved and control cytokine-supplemented populations were washed three times in RPMI. The proliferative ability of the TF-1 in response to cytokines was determined in [3H]thymidine incorporation studies. Briefly, starved TF-1 cells were washed once in RPMI 1640 containing 2% FCS and plated in 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well in complete medium with or without cytokine, incubated for 48 h before a 6-h pulse with [3H]thymidine (0.5 µCi/well). The cells were then harvested, and the relative levels of the DNA-incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting.Preparation of Cell ExtractsAt the time of the experiment, both TF-1 cells and peripheral circulating neutrophils were challenged with 270 pM GM-CSF. Cell suspensions were incubated with GM-CSF for various times at 37°C and lysed by the addition of 10 volumes of the cell suspension to one volume of lysis buffer (0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.7 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 µM p-nitro-phenyl-phosphate, 10 mM EGTA, 5.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 Mβ-glycerophosphate, 10 µM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM ammonium molybdate, 12 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, and 7 µg/ml pepstatin A). Cell lysates (0.4-0.9 mg/ml protein) were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 7,000 × g.Kinase Enzymatic Assays32P Incorporation into Substrates from Whole Cell LysatesThe enzymatic activities of p90rsk and p42MAPK were measured in whole cell lysates essentially as initially described (38Pelech S. Olwin B.B. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 383: 5968-5972Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and later optimized for polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells (39Huang C.K. Coleman H. Stevens T. Liang L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The RSK peptide (RRRLSSLRA) was the phosphoacceptor substrate used for measuring p90rsk and the MBP peptide (APRTPGGRR) was used for measuring p42MAPK. Either 100 µM RSK peptide, or 1 mM MBP peptide, was diluted in freshly prepared kinase buffer (13.4 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 25 mM MgCl2, 30 mM Na2VO3, 5 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 mM EGTA, 2 µM cAMP-dependent kinase inhibitor TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD, 21 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP/ml (7 nM), and 68 µM unlabeled ATP). 1 µg of cAMP-dependent kinase inhibitor inhibits 2,000-6,000 phosphorylating units of PKA (equivalent to the transference of 2-6 nmol of phosphate from ATP). This concentration is high enough, thus ensuring that protein kinase A is not utilizing RRRLSSLRA as a substrate and will not mask the measurement of the p90rsk activity. To initiate the phosphotransferase reaction, aliquots (20 µl) of kinase buffer were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with the cell lysates. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 10 min and terminated by blotting 20 µl of the reaction mixture onto P81 ion exchange chromatography cellulose phosphate papers. Filter squares were washed, dried, and counted for radioactivity.Immunoprecipitation and Immune Complex Kinase AssayImmunoprecipitation was carried out as reported previously (40Gomez-Cambronero J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications that are described in detail as follows. The protocol entailed a first step of an overnight incubation of the primary antibody (anti-p90rsk) at a final concentration of 10 µg/ml with anti-rabbit (IgG, whole molecule) antibody conjugated to agarose beads in lysis buffer (see above for composition). The beads were thoroughly washed and then mixed with crude cell lysates prepared as indicated above at a ratio agarose beads/cell lysates 1:2 (v/v). After a 4-h incubation period at 4°C, immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation. Pellets were washed two times with lysis buffer, two times with buffer A (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 400 mM LiCl) and two times with buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). The immunoprecipitation efficiency of both antibodies was monitored by Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates probed with the same kind of antibody used in the immunoprecipitation step. Immune complexes were resuspended in a final volume of 30 µl with lysis buffer and mixed with the kinase buffer. The reaction was carried out as indicated above.In-gel Renatured Kinase AssayWe followed the in situ or in-gel kinase assay as described previously (41Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Briefly, either 50 µg/ml RRRLSSLRA or 250 µg/ml MBP, to measure p90rsk or p42MAPK, respectively, was mixed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel solution before gel polymerization. After electrophoresis, gels were washed of SDS by incubation with 20% isopropanol in buffer A (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Gels were then incubated with buffer A containing 6 M guanidine-HCl, and proteins were renatured by incubation at 4°C for 6 h in buffer A containing 0.04% Tween 40. Renatured gels were overlaid with kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Gels were extensively washed with 1% pyrophosphate in 5% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and exposed to x-ray films.Western BlottingWestern blotting was performed as described previously (42Johnson G.M. Gomez-Cambronero J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with the appropriate stimulus and total cell lysates were prepared as indicated above. Proteins were electrophoresed and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline-Tween-20 (TBS-T) (20 mM Tris-base, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with the required primary antibody (1:1,000 dilution) in TBS-T and finally with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (for anti-MAP kinase antibody) or anti-rabbit (for anti-p90rsk antibody) at a 1:7,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were autoradiographed for variable lengths of time (ranging from 15 s to 1 min) with Kodak x-Omat film. When needed, protein bands were quantified by laser scanning densitometry at 633 nm in a LKB Ultroscan (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).DISCUSSIONWe demonstrate here that p90rsk is present in the human neutrophil. Based on immunological and biochemical characteristics, the neutrophil p90rsk corresponds closely to the RSK kinase reported previously in various mammalian cell lineages (29Sweet L.J. Alcorta D.A. Jones S.W. Erikson E. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2413-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Specific phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein by S6Ks is a highly conserved response to the stimulation of quiescent cells by mitogens. The presence of these kinases in neutrophils was not totally expected, because these cells neither divide nor differentiate.We further studied the presence of p90rsk and the response to GM-CSF in a type of hematopoietic proliferative cell, the erythroleukemia cell line TF-1. TF-1 cells are dependent on the presence of cytokines (i.e. GM-CSF, interleukin-3, or erythropoietin) for their survival. We found p90rsk was present in those cells. Further, exponentially growing TF-1 cells have a relatively high level of p90rsk (and MAP kinase) activation. However, this level nearly disappears when cells are deprived of the cytokine only to rapidly increase again when they are further exposed to GM-CSF. Because TF-1 cells that are cytokine-deprived do not proliferate (37Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.-F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), short challenge by GM-CSF might force them back from G0 to the cell cycle. As shown here, this exit/re-entry and concomitant cell proliferation might require the participation of p90rsk and/or MAP kinase. Because there seems to be less difference in GM-CSF-induced MAP kinase activity than there is with p90rsk (Fig. 7), RSK could be more definitely involved in cell cycling.The GM-CSF-induced p90rsk increment in enzymatic activity in neutrophils was quantitatively smaller than that observed in starved TF-1 cells challenged with GM-CSF or in HeLa cells activated with epidermal growth factor. Thus, p90rsk, although present in mature hemopoietic cells, is activated at an extent lower than in the proliferative counterpart. Whether this is an effect or a contributing cause of transcriptional paucity in cells that have reached maturity remains to be clearly elucidated. Different sets of substrates might be targeted in proliferative and mature cells. For instance, MAP kinase in proliferative cells translocates to the nucleus and targets transcription factors. In mature cells, MAP kinase targets membrane enzymes like cytosolic phospholipase A2 whose activation is more in line with the functionality of phagocytes (e.g., release of lipidic mediators of inflammation).What substrates are used by p90rsk to transduce signals downstream is a subject of intense study in different labs. To date, only two kind of substrates have been found for p90rsk: transcription factors and the G subunit of phosphatase 1 that regulates the activation of glycogen synthase (44Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Wah P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). As for mature neutrophils, we can only theorize that p90rsk might regulate the expression of c-fos. c-fos-specific transcripts are constitutively expressed in high levels in neutrophils (45Colotta F. Wang J.M. Polentarutti N. Mantovani A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that are further increased in presence of GM-CSF (46McColl S.R. Kreis C. DiPersio J.F. Borgeat P. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1989; 73: 588-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). INTRODUCTIONThe granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), 1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSFgranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factorMAPmitogen-activated proteinFCSfetal calf serumFMLPfMet-Leu-PheMBPmyelin basic protein. like other related cytokines, has multiple functions in cells of the immune system, namely, proliferation, differentiation, end-cell activity, and regulation of apoptosis. GM-CSF, as a growth factor for immature hematopoietic cells, plays a crucial role in the commitment of bone marrow stem cells, directing the proliferation and differentiation into specific lineage precursors and enhancing their survival (1Metcalf D. Science. 1985; 229: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 2Golde D.W. Gasson J.C. Gallin J.I. Boldstein J.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press Ltd., New York1988: 253Google Scholar, 3Clark S.C. Kamen R. Science. 1987; 236: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). Additionally, GM-CSF, as an stimulatory agent of terminally differentiated hematopoietic cells, is able to potentiate the activation of mature phagocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages, playing an important role in host defense (4Cannistra S.A. Griffin J.D. Semin. Hematol. 1988; 25: 173-188PubMed Google Scholar). In the neutrophil, GM-CSF is able to enhance cell chemotaxis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, expression of membrane antigens, phagocytosis, degranulation of lytic enzymes, and release of superoxide anions directed toward invading microbes (5Gomez-Cambronero J. Sha'afi R.I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 314: 35-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).In spite of lacking a tyrosine catalytic domain (6Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), the GM-CSF receptor is still able to induce rapid phosphorylation of multiple cell proteins on tyrosine residues in various cell types of the myeloid lineage, including the neutrophil (7Berkow R.L.

In fact, p42MAPK (ERK-2) is one of the proteins that undergoes the largest change in its tyrosyl phosphate content upon GM-CSF or fMet-Leu-Phe (chemotactic factor) treatment in the neutrophil.As it has been previously shown, MAP kinases p42, p44, and p54, become active by dual Thr/Tyr phosphorylation in response to mitogenic stimuli (23Ray L.B.

Cell. 1992; 68: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). p90rsk is itself a mitogen-activated Ser/Thr kinase. In vitro it can phosphorylate synthetic peptides like RRLSSLRA, which was modeled after the phosphorylation site of S6 protein of the mammalian small (40 S) ribosomal subunit (31Ahn N.G. Weil J.E.

Protein S6 has been long known to become the major phosphoprotein found in mammalian ribosomes of cells stimulated with growth factors (33Wool I.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 719-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this protein, which occurs during mitogen and growth factor activation of cells, could facilitate protein synthesis (34Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6007-6010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sturgill T.W. Wu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).We undertook this study firstly to ascertain whether p90rsk was present in mature hematopoietic cells. Because we were able to detect a significant amount of p90rsk in neutrophils, we further studied whether the kinase enzymatic activity was regulated upon cell stimulation with GM-CSF and how this effect compared with the situation in proliferating hematopoietic cells."

https://openalex.org/W1590860783,"The activation of the serine/threonine kinase, Raf-1, serves to connect upstream protein tyrosine kinases to downstream signaling events. We previously reported that FcγRI stimulation of interferon γ-differentiated U937 cells (termed U937IF cells) induces a mobility shift in Erk2. Herein, we report that cross-linking of FcγRI receptor in U937IF cells induces a marked tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 (10-fold increase). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 is induced by FcγRI activation and not by PMA (1 µg/ml), N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (1 µM), calcium ionophore (1 µM), thrombin (0.05 unit/ml), FcγRII, or FcγRIII stimulation. The kinetics of Raf-1 tyrosine phosphorylation is rapid, reaching peak levels 1-2 min after FcγRI activation, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 precedes the activation of the respiratory burst. FcγRI cross-linking induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc; tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc binds to Grb2 forming a Shc-Grb2 complex. The data provide evidence that the FcγRI receptor signals via the upstream activation of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, which leads to the subsequent activation of Ras family GTPases and serine/threonine kinases, Raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase.

Phosphorylation on tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues is a key regulatory mechanism in mammalian cells used to regulate the mitogenic or oncogenic potential of proteins by augmenting their enzymatic activity or modifying their association with other signal transducers (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). In this manner, Raf-1 activity also appears to be regulated by phosphorylation of key serine/threonine and tyrosine residues in that kinase activity correlates with the phosphorylation state of the Raf-1 protein (2Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Rapp U.R. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 85: 8855-8859Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Raf-1 is rapidly phosphorylated and activated following stimulation with growth factors and mitogens (3Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Escobedo J.A. Rapp U.R. Roberts T.M. Williams L.T.

In these experiments, mutation of residues 53-156 required for Ras-Raf-1 binding abrogated activation by Ras but had no effect on activation of Raf-1 by activated Src in Sf9 cell system. These and other data suggest that several independent mechanisms may exist for the regulation of Raf-1.

Raf-1, the proto-oncogene product of the c-raf-1 gene which is the cellular homologue of the murine transforming gene v-raf, is a 72-76-kDa phosphoprotein with intrinsic kinase activity for serine and threonine residues (2Morrison D.K.

Raf-1 is an effector of Ras and is one of the activators of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) (11Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1994; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis suggests that Raf family proteins have three unique conserved domains, named conserved region 1 (CR1), CR2, and CR3 (12Heidecker G. Kolch W. Morrison D.K. Rapp U.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 58: 53-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CR1 is a cysteine-rich residue having a putative zinc binding region. CR2 is a serine/threonine-rich region, and CR3 contains the protein kinase domain. Both CR1 and CR2 are located in the amino-terminal half of the Raf-1, which appears to regulate the catalytic activity of carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. The v-Raf protein of murine sarcoma virus 3611 is observed to have a deletion of the amino-terminal half of the protein. Deletion or mutation of the amino terminus activates the oncogenic transforming potential of Raf-1 (13Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Cleveland J.M. Kolch W. Beck T.W. Lloyd P. Pawson T. Rapp U.R. Mol.

In protein kinase cascades, Raf-1 appears to be a central intermediate in the transmission of proliferative, developmental, and oncogenic signals by mediating signals from receptor or nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, from p21ras to serine/threonine kinases, including MAP kinase kinase, MEK, MAP kinase, or ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) ultimately leading to activation of transcriptional factor, such as NF-κB/Rel, in the nucleus (15Buday L.

FcγRs, receptors for the Fc portion of IgG, are composed of three groups including FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), or FcγRIII (CD16) according to their binding affinity for the ligand.

Signaling through the ITAM shares a number of conserved features among the Ig gene superfamily of multisubunit receptors (23Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have reported that the FcγRI receptor stimulation results in the sequential activation of FcγRIγ, Hck, Syk and MAP kinase (24Pfefferkorn L.C. van de Winkel J.G. Swink S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8164-8171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The FcγRI receptor is also linked to the cytoskeleton and is involved in a number of well characterized cell biologic signals (activation of respiratory burst, phagocytosis, or cell motility, etc.). Importantly, the myeloid respiratory burst is a well characterized response known to be regulated by small GTPases, Rac1, Rac2, and Rap1a (25Freeman J.L. Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13431-13435Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the respiratory burst may be also regulated by the known effectors of these GTPases (i.e. Raf-1 or PAK65, etc.) (26Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E.

Cross-linking of FcγR induces activation events, including tyrosine phosphorylation of γ subunit (27Huang M.M. Indik Z. Brass L.F. Hoxie J.A. Schreiber A.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 299: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our laboratory uses the myeloid cell line U937 differentiated in IFNγ (termed U937IF cells) to study FcγRI signal transduction. We are interested in the mechanism by which signals are transmitted from FcγRI receptor to the respiratory burst. We previously reported that the stimulation of FcγRI receptor in U937IF cells results in tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Syk (32Durden D.L. Liu Y.B. Blood. 1994; 84: 2102-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently we demonstrated that FcγRI cross-linking activated Src family kinase, Hck and a mobility shift of MAP kinase (33Durden D.L. Kim H.M. Calore B. Liu Y.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4039-4047PubMed Google Scholar). These results lead us to hypothesize a role for Raf-1 in FcγRI signal relay. Herein, we demonstrate that Raf-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated after FcγRI stimulation (10-fold increase). Both Hck and Syk are activated following FcγRI stimulation, making them good candidate kinases for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1. We also observe the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and the association of Shc and Grb2 in U937IF cells activated by FcγRI stimulation (not FcγRII or FcγRIII activation). Our results suggest that Raf-1 is major substrate for protein tyrosine kinases following FcγRI cross-linking, which results the sequential activation of Shc, Grb2, Ras, Raf-1, and MAP kinases transmitting FcγRI signals that result in the assembly of an active respiratory burst complex. The FcγR-specific antibodies were obtained from Medarex Inc. (West Lebanon, NH). The mAb 197 and mAb 32.2 are specific for the FcγRIα subunit, mAb 32.2 is a F(ab′)2 fragment of IgG, mAb IV.3 is specific for FcγRIIα subunit, and mAb 3G8 is specific for FcγRIIIα subunit of Fc receptor for IgG. The cross-linking antibody was a rabbit anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragment (RαM) purchased from Organon Teknika Corp. (West Chester, PA). Anti-Raf-1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) and anti-Shc antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-Grb2 antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-MAP kinase antiserum (polyclonal antibody 1913.2) against the peptide KELIFEETARFQPGY, corresponding to the extreme COOH terminus of the Xenopus Erk2, was provided by Jonathan A. Cooper, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Seattle, WA). This region of the Xenopus MAP kinase is 100% conserved with human Erk2 and 85% conserved in human Erk1 (34Posada J. Cooper J.A. Science. 1992; 255: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). U937 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum and differentiated with 250 units/ml human recombinant IFNγ (kindly provided by Genentech Corp., San Francisco, CA) for 4 days. U937IF cells were cultured at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml, and the medium was replenished with fresh IFNγ (250 units/ml) every 2 days, as described (35Roberts P.J. Devalia V. Faint R. Pizzey A. Bainton A.L. Thomas N.S. Pilkington G.R. Linch D.C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3104-3115PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis of U937IF cells demonstrated equal expression of FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII (data not shown). For stimulation of FcγR receptors of U937IF cells, cells were washed twice in cold HBSS and adjusted to a concentration of 4 × 107 cells/ml. Cells in a 0.5-ml volume were incubated on ice for 30 min with anti-FcγR antibodies (0.25 µg/sample). We then added 10 µg/ml RαM (F(ab′)2 fragment) antibody at 37°C for different times. Stimulated cells were cooled rapidly with cold HBSS and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min in a cold centrifuge. A cell pellet was lysed with 800 µl of Triton X-100 extraction buffer (EB buffer) on ice for 30 min or resuspended in 25 µl of 1 × sample buffer/2 × 106 cells for whole cell lysates. Cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer (EB buffer) containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 µM phenylarsine oxide, and 100 µM sodium orthovanadate. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 45 min at 4°C. For precipitation of Raf-1 protein, we added 10 µl of the polyclonal anti-Raf-1 antibody to cleared cell lysates. After incubation on ice for 2 h, 100 µl of a 10% solution of formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus was added to the anti-Raf-1 immunoprecipitates and incubated on ice for 1 h. The absorbed immune complexes were washed three times in EB buffer and resuspended with 25 µl of 1 × sample buffer. After boiling at 98°C for 5 min, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on 10% acrylamide, 0.193% bisacrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (1 mAh/cm2) using a dry transfer system (Alert Inc., Seattle, WA), as described (36Kazlauskas A. Durden D.L. Cooper J.A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The blot was incubated with blocking solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% powdered milk) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with specific anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)), anti-Raf-1, anti-Shc, anti-Grb2, or anti-MAP kinase antibodies for 2 h at room temperature with continuous agitation. After three washes in rinse solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl), the membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) or conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for colorimetric development. To reprobe the membrane, we stripped membrane with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5, at room temperature for 30 min and then reblotted with primary antibody. The generation of superoxide anions by U937IF cells was measured as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c at 550 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices Inc., Menlo Park, CA), using air-oxidized and dithionite-reduced cytochrome c as standards. Cells were preincubated for 10 min at 37°C in HBSS in the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. The final reaction mixture contained 2 × 106 U937IF cells and 80 µM ferricytochrome c in 250 µl of HBSS. One-half of the wells received superoxide dismutase (25 µg/ml). After the addition of antibodies or various agonists, the plates were incubated at 37°C and agitated. Serial spectrometric determination was recorded to construct a kinetic curve for the production of superoxide anion. Maximum reduction of ferricytochrome c (25 nm) was achieved by adding 5 µl of freshly prepared sodium dithionite. Production of superoxide anion is expressed as nanomoles of superoxide-dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction/2 × 106 cells. To evaluate the involvement of Raf-1 in FcγRI signaling, we examined whether Raf-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated after FcγRI stimulation in U937IF cells. Lysates of 2 × 107 U937IF cells were immunoblotted for Raf-1 after differentiation in IFNγ. IFNγ increased the expression of p74 Raf-1 (3-fold increase). Raf-1 expression directly correlated with the length of exposure to IFNγ and peaked at 4 days after differentiation (data not shown). We subsequently used U937IF cells differentiated for 4 days with IFNγ for all experiments. To determine whether FcγRI cross-linking can induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 in myeloid cells, 2 × 107 U937IF cells were first incubated with mAb 197, followed by stimulation with RαM. We immunoprecipitated Raf-1 from resting or FcγRI-stimulated U937IF cells with a rabbit anti-Raf-1 antibody and performed anti-Tyr(P) immunoblots (mAb 4G10) (Fig. 1). Marked tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 was detected after cross-linking of FcγRI receptor (10-fold increase) (Fig. 1A, lanes 6-8). The tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 is very rapid and reaches its maximum response 30 s to 1 min after stimulation (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 7). Raf-1 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in resting cells (Fig. 1A, lane 3) or in U937IF cells stimulated with FcγRI alone or RαM alone (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). To confirm the identity of the 74-kDa protein, the membrane was stripped and reprobed for Raf-1 (Fig. 1B). All lanes except sham and preimmune immunoprecipitates brought down an equivalent amount of Raf-1 protein (Fig. 1B, lanes 3-8). The p74 immunoreactive bands of anti-Raf-1 immunoblot is superimposed on tyrosine-phosphorylated bands in anti-Raf-1 immunoprecipitates. The results show that Raf-1 immunoprecipitated from FcγRI activated cells is tyrosine-phosphorylated. In other experiments, separate immunoblots of rabbit anti-Raf-1 immunoprecipitates were probed with mouse anti-Tyr(P) or mouse anti-Raf-1 antibodies. The results were exactly the same as our findings previously shown in Fig. 1. Parallel blots of anti-Raf-1 immunoprecipitates, probed with secondary antibody alone, showed no Raf-1 band. Finally, the whole cell lysate confirmed the integrity of our Raf-1 immunoblots (Fig. 1, lane 9). We suggest that the observed difference in intensity of the p74 band in the whole cell lysate versus the anti-Raf-1 immunoprecipitates is due to the presence of more than one p72-74 phosphoprotein with similar electrophoretic mobility. Evidence to support this conclusion include the identification of Raf-1 and Syk kinases as components of the p72-74 phosphoprotein bands (32Durden D.L. Liu Y.B. Blood. 1994; 84: 2102-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm these results, we performed anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitation using agarose-conjugated anti-Tyr(P) antibodies on resting and FcγRI-stimulated U937IF cells. We probed these immunoprecipitates with rabbit anti-Raf-1 antibody (Fig. 2A). Only anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitate from FcγRI activated reacted specifically with anti-Raf-1 antibody (Fig. 2A, lane 3). FcγRIII activation did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 (Fig. 2A, lane 4). When the membrane was stripped and reprobed for phosphotyrosine, the tyrosine-phosphorylated Raf-1 band was superimposed on the upper band of anti-Tyr(P) immunoblot indicated (Fig. 2B, lane 3). The whole cell lysate confirmed the integrity of anti-Tyr(P) and anti-Raf-1 immunoblots (Fig. 2B, lane 5). We observe a diminished number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in our anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates as compared to the whole cell lysates. This is likely due to decreased efficiency of immunoprecipitation by the agarose-conjugated anti-Tyr(P) antibody. The loss of membrane-bound proteins during stripping and washing may decrease the resolution of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in our anti-Tyr(P) immunoblot. These data confirm the results shown in Fig. 1 and reveal that Raf-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon FcγRI activation. We determined the kinetics of Raf-1 tyrosine phosphorylation upon FcγRI activation and its relation to respiratory burst, a signaling pathway in myeloid cells known to be modulated by GTPases Rac and Rap1a (25Freeman J.L. Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13431-13435Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 occurs 20 s after FcγRI stimulation (Fig. 3A, lane 5) and reached a peak around 1-2 min (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8) and disappeared 10 min after stimulation (Fig. 3A, lane 10). The respiratory burst begins 3-5 min after FcγRI activation (Fig. 3B). FcγRI cross-linking activated respiratory burst to produce 2.2 nM superoxide from 2 × 106 cells 10 min after stimulation and showed peak response 30 min after stimulation. PMA also stimulated the respiratory response to produce superoxide anion, but its maximum response was delayed compared to activation of respiratory burst through FcγRI stimulation. The respiratory burst is preceded by the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, Hck, MAP kinases, and Raf-1, suggesting that Raf-1 could function upstream in the FcγRI signal pathway leading to the activation of the respiratory burst response (32Durden D.L. Liu Y.B. Blood. 1994; 84: 2102-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Durden D.L. Kim H.M. Calore B. Liu Y.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4039-4047PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 we observed is specific for FcγRI activation, we determined the effect of cross-linking of other Fcγ receptors, such as FcγRII and FcγRIII, as well as stimulation with other agonists, such as PMA (1 µg/ml), FMLP (1 µM), calcium ionophore (1 µM), or thrombin (0.05 unit/ml), on tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 (Fig. 4). In these experiments, we immunoprecipitated an equivalent amount of Raf-1 (Fig. 4B, lanes 3-14). Only FcγRI stimulation of U937IF cells resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 11 and 12). PMA, FMLP, calcium ionophore, and thrombin did not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 4-7). Similarly, FcγRII or FcγRIII cross-linking did not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 8, 9, 13, and 14). These results indicate that FcγRI stimulation specifically induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1. Interestingly, FcγRIII stimulation is not observed to induce the respiratory burst in U937IF cells, nor does it induce a mobility shift in MAP kinase, or the activation of Hck or Syk kinases (Fig. 6, lanes 11 and 12) (32Durden D.L. Liu Y.B. Blood. 1994; 84: 2102-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Durden D.L. Kim H.M. Calore B. Liu Y.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4039-4047PubMed Google Scholar).

We performed experiments to determine if Shc becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated after FcγRI stimulation. Shc was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Shc antibody from U937IF lysates prepared from resting or FcγRI-stimulated cells and immunoblotted with mouse anti-Tyr(P) antibody (Fig. 5A, lanes 3-11). We observed that the p52 isoform of Shc is tyrosine-phosphorylated after FcγRI activation (Fig. 5A, lane 8). Anti-Shc immunoblot confirmed that the anti-Shc immunoprecipitation brought down the same as amount of p46 and p52 Shc proteins (Fig. 5C, lanes 3-11). The tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc is required for recruitment of a Shc-Grb2 physical interaction. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and coprecipitation of Shc and Grb2 were observed only under condition of FcγRI activation (Fig. 5B, lanes 8 and 9). Lane 12 represents a whole cell lysate of U937IF cells and confirms the integrity of anti-Grb2 and anti-Shc immunoblots. These results suggest that Shc is involved in FcγRI signaling pathway and Grb2 associates with Shc in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner during FcγRI activation. In other experiments, we have observed a physical interaction between the Shc-SH2 domain and the FcγRIγ subunit. 2R. K. Park, Y. Liu, and D. L. Durden, unpublished results. W"

https://openalex.org/W1980070945,"It was previously observed that the B subunit of the tonoplast V-ATPase is modified by the photoactivated nucleotide analog 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyladenosine 5′-triphosphate (BzATP) (Manolson, M. F., Rea, P. A., and Poole, R. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12273-12279). We have further characterized the nucleotide binding sites on the V-ATPase and the interaction between BzATP and the B subunit. We observe that the V-ATPase isolated from bovine clathrin-coated vesicles possesses approximately 1 mol of endogenous, tightly bound ATP/mol of V-ATPase complex. BzATP is not a substrate for the V-ATPase, but does act as a noncovalent inhibitor in the absence of irradiation, changing the kinetic characteristics of ATP hydrolysis. Irradiation of the V-ATPase in the presence of [3H]BzATP results primarily in modification of the 58-kDa B subunit, with complete inhibition of V-ATPase activity occurring upon modification of one B subunit per V-ATPase complex. Inhibition occurs as the result of modification of a rapidly (t1/2 < 2 min) exchangeable site, and yet this site does not correspond to a catalytic site, as indicated by the effects of cysteine-modifying reagents which react with Cys254 located at the catalytic sites on the A subunit. Thus, the noncatalytic nucleotide binding site modified by BzATP appears to be rapidly exchangeable. The site of [3H]BzATP modification of the B subunit was localized to the region Ile164 to Gln171, which from the x-ray crystal structure of the homologous F-ATPase α subunit, is within 10 Å of the ribose ring of ATP bound to the noncatalytic nucleotide binding site.

An artificial fusion of this ubiquitin-like protein to E. coli β-galactosidase was not cleaved when expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), indicating that yeast lack this cleaving activity. The yeast rpS30 homolog (yrpS30) was purified and sequenced to reveal a 63-residue protein with 61% sequence identity to mammalian rpS30. Degenerate oligonucleotides based on the yrpS30 sequence were used to isolate full-length yrpS30 cDNAs. Sequence analysis of five cDNA clones revealed that yrpS30 is not synthesized as a fusion to a ubiquitin-like protein but is extended at its N terminus by a single methionine residue. The corresponding gene was identified in the GenBank™ data base by sequence alignment and termed RPS30A. The gene consists of two exons separated by a 430-base pair intron, which contains consensus splicing elements.

Ribosomes in the mutant strains contain an authentic yrpS30 protein, indicating that a functional yrpS30 is expressed from the duplicated gene but that the reduced capacity for yrpS30 synthesis restricted the growth rate. Analysis of available DNA sequence data bases reveals that rpS30 is synthesized as a fusion to a ubiquitin-like protein in nematodes and mammals but unfused in yeast, plants, and protazoa."
https://openalex.org/W2087958308,"A 66-kDa glycosylated carboxypeptidase, plasma pro-carboxypeptidase B (pro-plasma CPB), has recently been identified in human blood (Eaton, D. L., Malloy, B. E., Tsai, S. P., Henzel, W., and Drayna, D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21833-21838). The pro-enzyme binds to plasminogen and the active enzyme is specific for COOH-terminal Lys or Arg residues. These properties implicate a role in the fibrinolytic or coagulation system. However, we show that the molecular mass of the active plasma CPB is approximately 36 kDa, which is below the glomerular filtration limit. Since activated plasma CPB no longer binds plasminogen, the active enzyme may not be retained in the circulation. To investigate this, we performed plasma elimination studies in mice which showed that 125I-plasma CPB remains in the circulation despite its small size. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of blood samples removed from the mice revealed that plasma CPB migrated as a high molecular weight band. Similar bands were observed in vitro when 125I-plasma CPB was added to plasma from humans and other species. The plasma CPB-binding proteins were purified from human plasma and identified as α2-macroglobulin (α2M) and pregnancy zone protein. Only the active enzyme bound to the two α-macroglobulins, and the interaction was specific for α2M in its native conformation, but not its receptor recognized forms. The complex between human α2M and plasma CPB dissociated during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transverse urea gel electrophoresis suggesting that the interaction was noncovalent and depended on the tertiary structure of the native α2M molecule. The catalytic activity of plasma CPB was not significantly affected by its binding to α2M. The specific binding of plasma CPB to α-macroglobulins suggest that these proteins may function as a “shuttle” in vivo to modulate the clearance of plasma CPB from the circulatory system.

INTRODUCTIONUntil recently it was assumed that the only plasma carboxypeptidase capable of releasing COOH-terminal Arg and Lys residues was carboxypeptidase N (30Plummer Jr., T.H. Erdos E.G.

This enzyme has been implicated in modulating the properties and activities of several peptide hormones and proteins, including kinins, anaphylatoxins, fibrinopetides, enkephalin hexapeptides, and creatine kinase (35Skidgel R.A.

The protein sequence predicted from cDNA revealed that the protein is structurally similar to pancreatic pro-carboxypeptidase B (11Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1992; 14: 549-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the protein is secreted by the liver.Activation of pro-plasma CPB may be achieved by proteolysis of the Arg92-Ala93 peptide bond by trypsin or other Arg-specific serine proteinases. However, the activation of pro-plasma CPB requires high concentrations of these proteinases and results in concomitant inactivation (11Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol.

Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the homologous pancreatic pro-carboxypeptidase B, which is activated by relatively low concentrations of trypsin and suffers no further degradation (31Reeck G.R. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1972; 21: 3947-3955Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar; 4Burgos F.J. Salva M. Villegas V. Soriano F. Mendez E. Aviles F.X. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4082-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Unlike pancreatic pro-carboxypeptidase B whose function is to serve as a digestive enzyme, the function of pro-plasma CPB is unclear, although its interaction with plasminogen suggests a role in fibrinolysis.The binding of pro-plasma CPB to plasminogen is mediated by the plasminogen Lys binding sites. These Lys binding sites are also important for the activation and regulation of plasminogen (24Lijnen H.R. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10214-10222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 7Clemmensen J. Thorsen S. Mullertz S. Petersen L.C. Eur. J.

Res. 1991; 64: 69-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Specifically, the binding of α2-antiplasmin to plasminogen have been shown to depend on Lys residues present in the COOH-terminal region of α2-antiplasmin (32Sasaki T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. Tokyo. 1986; 99: 1699-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar; 18Hortin G.L. Gibson B.L. Fok K.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, the Lys binding sites participate in the binding of plasminogen and plasmin to fibrin and fibrinogen. A newly formed fibrin clot does not contain any COOH-terminal Lys residues and the plasminogen and the plasmin binding capacity is limited. Following the initial partial plasmin degradation COOH-terminal Lys residues are exposed and these residues act as additional binding sites for tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen, and plasmin. The exposure of these Lys residues most likely affects the stamina of the fibrin clot (40Tran-Tang C. Kruithof E.K.G. Backman F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; 17Higgins D.L. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7786-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consequently, the interaction between Lys and Lys binding sites represents a potential target for regulation of the fibrinolytic system. In particular, it has been suggested that the binding of histidine-rich glycoprotein to the Lys binding sites of plasminogen may prevent the binding of plasminogen to fibrinogen and fibrin (24Lijnen H.R. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10214-10222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 20Ichinose A. Mimuro J. Koide T. Aoki N. Thromb. Res. 1984; 33: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is similarly conceivable that a Lys-specific carboxypeptidase may interfere with the degradation of the fibrin clot by removing COOH-terminal Lys residues from fibrin (29Pannell R. Black J. Gurewich V. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar; 28Miles L.A. Dahlberg L.A. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar; 1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar).Any potential biological role for plasma CPB is limited by the biodistribution of the active enzyme. Since the 36-kDa plasma CPB is smaller than the glomerular filtration limit of approximately 60 kDa, it may be expected that plasma CPB is quickly removed from the blood stream. However, we have found that the active enzyme is retained in the circulation of mice. In addition we describe the strong interactions between plasma CPB and the α-macroglobulin proteinase inhibitors α2-macroglobulin (α2M) and pregnancy zone protein in terms of binding specificity, stability of the interaction, and effect on the proteolytic activity of plasma CPB. The interaction with these large proteins could prevent the renal filtration of plasma CPB and explain its slow clearance from the bloodstream. Thus, the interaction of plasma CPB with the α-macroglobulins may modulate its biodistribution and capacity to hydrolyze substrates in the fibrinolytic system.DISCUSSIONThe 60-kDa pro-plasma CPB most likely circulates in complex with plasminogen. This affinity for plasminogen is lost with proteolytic activation to plasma CPB (38Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The activation peptide is glycosylated and contributes significantly to the size of pro-plasma CPB. Size exclusion chromatography of pro-plasma CPB and plasma CPB suggests that the activation peptide dissociates following activation. Consequently, the 36-kDa plasma CPB would be expected to undergo elimination by glomerular filtration. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that the half-life of pancreatic carboxypeptidase B injected into the bloodstream is only a few minutes (13Erdos E.G. Renfrew A.G. Sloane E.M. Wohler J.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1963; 104: 222-234Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). If plasma CPB is eliminated from the blood as quickly as pancreatic carboxypeptidase B, it would be difficult to imagine a significant role for regulating biological processes within the circulatory system. However, using mouse plasma elimination studies, we found that both the zymogen and the enzymatically active 36-kDa plasma CPB remained in the blood. More importantly, our data indicate that plasma CPB is not eliminated by glomerular filtration because it binds to α2M and pregnancy zone protein present in plasma. Human plasma CPB was able to form complexes with similar high molecular weight proteins present in the plasma of other mammalian species, birds, and even amphibians, suggesting evolutionary conservation of the binding mechanism.The involvement of the α-macroglobulins is interesting since, besides functioning as proteinase inhibitors, more recent evidence suggests that α2M may regulate the plasma stability or clearance of various smaller proteins such as hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and antigens (22LaMarre J. Wollenberg G.K. Gonias S.L. Hayes M.A. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar; 15Gonias S.L. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 302-311PubMed Google Scholar; 3Borth W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar; 6Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 792-812PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases, the actual mechanism(s) of binding have not been fully defined. We investigated the possible role of two well defined mechanisms of binding to α2M. Following proteolytic cleavage of the α2M “bait region,” the thiol esters become highly reactive and may interact with amino groups on the surface of the attacking proteinase, or other proteins in the vicinity, to form covalent ε-lysyl-γ-glutamyl cross-links (reviewed in 6Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 792-812PubMed Google Scholar). Concurrently, α2M undergoes a conformational change, migrating faster during native PAGE. This form of α2M is recognized by cell surface receptors and is rapidly removed from the circulation (21Imber M.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8124-8139PubMed Google Scholar) along with the bound proteins. Analysis of the α2M·plasma CPB complex by native PAGE revealed that plasma CPB was bound exclusively to the slow form of α2M and it did not elicit a conformational change, consistent with its slow clearance from the circulation. Moreover, there was no evidence for covalent cross-links during analysis by SDS-PAGE. Thus, plasma CPB interacts with α2M in a manner distinct from endoproteinases. Likewise, although anhydrotrypsin also interacts noncovalently with slow α2M, binding to a site on the surface of α2M distinct from that occupied by active proteinases, anhydrotrypsin, did not displace plasma CPB from α2M. Thus, anhydrotrypsin and plasma CPB do not occupy the same site. Other properties of the plasma CPB binding site characterized in this study include the finding that: (i) the site is masked during the slow to fast conformational change, and (ii) the interaction depends on the native conformations of α2M and plasma CPB since the complex dissociates during TUG electrophoresis.Pro-plasma CPB can be activated in vitro by cleavage of Arg92-Ala93 by Arg-specific proteinases including trypsin, thrombin, and plasmin (11Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The activation requires high concentrations of proteinases, and all the proteinases examined so far concomitantly inactivate plasma CPB by cleaving the Arg330-Tyr331 bond. Although it has been suggested that this inactivation may function as a control mechanism in vivo (11Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the data in this study suggest an alternative scenario. Trypsin activation of pro-plasma CPB did indeed generate several products, including the activation peptide, a COOH-terminal peptide, active plasma CPB, and a NH2- and COOH-terminal truncated fragment (see Fig. 1). Size exclusion chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the interaction between α2M and the activation products was specific for intact plasma CPB (Fig. 5). Moreover, it was only activated plasma CPB, and not pro-plasma CPB, that was bound (Figs. 3, 4, and 6). It is, thus, likely that plasma CPB binds α2M following activation and is protected from further degradation by either the activating proteinase or other proteinases. Of note is the fact that the interaction is specific for the conformational form of α2M with a long plasma half-life, and this form is an efficient inhibitor of most endoproteinases (33Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 233: 121-141Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A high molecular weight carboxypeptidase has recently been identified in human plasma (42Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpe S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15937-15944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme called unstable carboxypeptidase (CPU) has a similar specificity and size as plasma CPB, and seems to be noncovalently associated with high molecular weight plasma proteins. It is conceivable that the detected activity is derived from the α2M·plasma CPB complex and not a novel carboxypeptidase.Since the binding of plasma CPB with α2M did not affect its catalytic activity, this interaction represents a potentially important mechanism for prolonging the availability of the active enzyme. This finding is consistent with the proposed role of pro-plasma CPB in regulation of fibrinolysis, coagulation, and other COOH-terminal Lys dependent events. INTRODUCTIONUntil recently it was assumed that the only plasma carboxypeptidase capable of releasing COOH-terminal Arg and Lys residues was carboxypeptidase N (30Plummer Jr., T.H. Erdos E.G.

In contrast, Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells transfected with L-APP677, which occurs naturally by alternative splicing of exon 15, secreted this isoform both apically and basolaterally, while maintaining the basolateral sorting of endogenous APPsec. This suggests that the alternative splicing of APP exon 15 modulates the polarized sorting of secretory APP. The same alternative splicing event also decreased the production of βA4 relative to p3.

https://openalex.org/W1997002133,"Abstract D-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH) (EC) from Escherichia coli is an allosterically regulated enzyme of the Vmax type. It is a tetramer of identical subunits and each subunit is made up of three identifiable domains, the cofactor binding domain, the substrate binding domain, and the regulatory domain. Each subunit contacts two other subunits through adjacent cofactor binding domains and through adjacent regulatory domains. L-Serine, the physiological effector, inhibits catalytic activity by apparently tethering regulatory domains from adjacent subunits together through the formation of hydrogen bonds to each subunit. This investigation demonstrates that cross-linking adjacent regulatory domains with engineered disulfides produces catalytic inhibition in the absence of inhibitor in a manner similar to that produced by the inhibitor. The inhibition due to cross-linking can be completely reversed in a concentration dependent manner by dithiothreitol. The active mutant enzyme, containing the engineered cysteines in the reduced state, retains its ability to be inhibited by L-serine, although at a 100-fold higher concentration. Hill plots of the serine inhibition of mutant and native enzyme indicate that the number of interacting sites remains at 2 in the mutant enzyme. The reversible inhibition of enzyme activity that results from tethering adjacent regulatory domains with engineered disulfides suggests that these domains move in some manner relative to one another during the active to inhibited state transition. These observations support the model which predicts that catalytic activity is regulated by the movement of rigid domains about flexible hinges and that effector binding prevents this by locking the regulatory domains in a state that produces an open active site cleft."

We have identified early changes in protein phosphorylation that can occur following ligation of CD28. We have previously shown (7Hutchcroft J.E. Bierer B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3260-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that stimulation of human peripheral T lymphocytes or Jurkat T cells with anti-CD28 mAb led to a rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD28 as detected in immune complex kinase assays and in in vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling studies. Notably, this induction of tyrosine kinase activity was readily apparent in the absence of phorbol ester treatment. Incubation of the cells with PMA did, however, have dramatic effects on the in vitro phosphorylation profile of CD28 immune complexes. In particular, there was a pronounced increase in the basal levels of CD28 phosphorylation in the absence of CD28 ligation. Thus, triggering of an initial signaling cascade by PMA visibly altered the CD28 signaling complex. To characterize further these PMA-induced and activation-dependent changes, we have developed a procedure for the enzymatic deglycosylation of CD28 that permits identification of the receptor following separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Identification of the deglycosylated CD28 protein was confirmed by cell-surface biotinylation, [35S]methionine/cysteine metabolic labeling and silver staining studies. This technique has allowed us to assess stimulation-dependent changes in the phosphorylation state of CD28 in human peripheral T lymphocytes, Jurkat T cells, and the Jurkat subclone, J.Cam1, that is deficient in Lck tyrosine kinase activity. We found that PMA treatment caused a rapid and Lck-independent increase in the in vitro phosphorylation of CD28 on threonine residues. A CD28 mAb stimulation of the CD28 receptor resulted in manganese-and Lck-dependent phosphorylation of CD28 on tyrosine residues. No evidence was found for serine or threonine phosphorylation of CD28 by its associated signaling protein, PI3 kinase. Stimulation of Jurkat cells with anti-CD28 mAb induced the in vivo phosphorylation of CD28 on tyrosine residues; this in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of CD28 was inhibited by PMA treatment and was completely absent in J.Cam1 cells. Thus, treatment of T lymphocytes with PMA and anti-CD28 mAb, conditions sufficient to stimulate IL-2 production, triggers two distinct phosphorylation pathways, one involving PKC-dependent stimulation of threonine kinase activity, the other involving tyrosine kinase activity. We propose that both of these signaling pathways are important for CD28-dependent lymphokine production. Human peripheral blood T lymphocytes were isolated by centrifugation through Ficoll (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC), plastic adherence, and nylon wool filtration. Contaminating red blood cells were lysed with Tris-buffered ammonium chloride. These T cells were generally >92% CD3+, 88% CD28+, 96% CD2+, and 100% major histocompatibility complex class I+, as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown). The T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat clone J77 was kindly provided by Kendall Smith (Cornell University, New York) and the Lck− J.Cam1 cell line was from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Cells were routinely cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in 10% RPMI (RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2 (M. A. Bioproducts, Bethesda, MD), 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma)). The anti-CD28 mAb 9.3 (Bristol Myers Squibb, Seattle, WA) was used in most experiments. The anti-CD28 mAb 2E12 (the kind gift of R. Mittler, Bristol Myers Squibb), the anti-CD5 mAb Leu 1 (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), the polyclonal antisera raised against an N-terminal peptide of human p56lck (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and the anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 (ATCC) were used where indicated. The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was a gift from T. Roberts (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Cells were washed twice with buffer A (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, and 2 mM glutamine). Cells (between 0.5 and 3 × 107) were resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A and incubated with mAb for 15 min on ice, then 5 min at 37°C. The cells were lysed by addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold 2 × lysis buffer (2% Brij 96, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, and 20 µg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatants were harvested and used as the anti-CD28 mAb-activated detergent extracts. Identical amounts of mAb were added to “unactivated” cell extracts after lysis. Under these conditions, equivalent amounts of CD28 protein are immunoprecipitated, as detected by silver staining and [5S]methionine/cysteine in vivo labeling experiments (data not shown). The protein extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 15 µl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with 1 × lysis buffer containing 0.2% Brij 96 and once with detergent-free lysis buffer. Samples were incubated at 30°C for 3 min in kinase buffer (10 mM MnCl2, 5 mMρ-nitrophenyl phosphate, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM sodium orthophosphate, and 25 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Some experiments were performed using kinase buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2 instead of MnCl2, as indicated. In some experiments, the radiolabeled CD28 immunoprecipitates were subject to further washing, deglycosylation, and phosphoamino acid analysis as described below. Alternatively, the kinase reactions were stopped by direct addition of SDS sample buffer, and the phosphoproteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and detected by autoradiography. Where indicated, membranes were incubated for 2 h at 60°C in 1 M potassium hydroxide, a treatment that induces the preferential dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8, then resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/ml in a freshly prepared 1 mg/ml solution of sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate-biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8. Cells were rocked gently at 4°C for 45 min and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5 mg/ml glycine to quench unbound biotin. The cells were then lysed in RIPA (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin), and the immunoprecipitates were collected and deglycosylated as described below. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, the biotinylated proteins were transferred to PVDF, probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.), developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Corp.), and detected by autoradiography. Jurkat T cells were washed once with 10% RPMI and then once with labeling media (methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI supplemented with 3% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine). Cells were then incubated for 2 h at 37°C in labeling medium containing 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (DuPont NEN). The cells were washed twice in buffer A (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, and 2 mM glutamine), then lysed for 30 min on ice in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin). Where indicated, 1 mM iodoacetamide was added to the lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were collected and deglycosylated as described below. The radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were then incubated for 30 min in protein fixation buffer (25% methanol and 10% acetic acid), washed three times with water, and incubated with Autofluor (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) for 1 h. The 35S-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography of the dried gels. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with RIPA (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin), twice with RIPA containing 1 M NaCl, twice more with RIPA, and once with Buffer D (0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin). The immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured by boiling for 10 min in a solution of 0.5% SDS and 1%β-mercaptoethanol, then adjusted to 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The proteins were incubated with 1,000 units of PNGase F (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) for 1 h at 37°C. PNGase F hydrolyzes N-glycan chains from proteins. The deglycosylated proteins were separated on 10.5% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized as indicated. Anti-CD28 mAb immunoprecipitates were phosphorylated in vitro and deglycosylated as described above. Following separation on 10.5% SDS-PAGE gels, the phosphoproteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and detected by autoradiography. The radiolabeled CD28 phosphoprotein bands were excised from the membrane and incubated in 5.7 N HCl for 90 min at 110°C. The resulting phosphoamino acids were separated by one-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis (17Jelinek T. Weber M.J. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 629-630Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography. The migration positions of phosphotyrosine, phosphothreonine, and phosphoserine standards (Sigma) were detected with ninhydrin (Sigma). Anti-CD28 immunoprecipitates were deglycosylated as described above, separated on 10.5% SDS-PAGE gels, and then transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated sequentially with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10, then HRP-coupled sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Corp.). The phosphotyrosine-containing protein bands were detected by autoradiography after enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) development. Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in the regulation of both enzymatic activity and protein-protein interactions. Since resting human peripheral T lymphocytes are not amenable to in vivo orthophosphate labeling studies, we have used in vitro kinase assays to develop procedures that can be used to examine the early biochemical interactions between CD28 and its associated complex of signaling proteins. CD28 immune complexes were prepared from Brij 96 detergent lysates of Jurkat T cells and then incubated in vitro with [γ-32P]ATP. The resulting phosphoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, alkali-treated to enrich for tyrosine phosphorylation, and detected by autoradiography. As previously reported (7Hutchcroft J.E. Bierer B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3260-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we found that stimulation of the intact cells with the anti-CD28 mAb 9.3 prior to detergent lysis led to the increased phosphorylation of several CD28-associated proteins (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2) including the cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn (7Hutchcroft J.E. Bierer B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3260-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8August A. Dupont B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1466-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Also, there was a notable increase in the phosphorylation of a broadly diffuse protein band migrating between 40 and 50 kDa. The identification of this phosphoprotein as CD28 was confirmed by two-dimensional nonreducing-reducing gel electrophoresis studies (7Hutchcroft J.E. Bierer B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3260-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the cells with 5 ng/ml PMA for 18 h had a pronounced effect on the phosphorylation profiles displayed in CD28 immune complexes (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). There was a dramatic increase in overall levels of protein phosphorylation, particularly of CD28 itself, even in the absence of anti-CD28 mAb stimulation (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3). However, a small but detectable activation-dependent increase in phosphorylation was still seen in immune complexes prepared from the PMA-treated cells (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, triggering of a signaling cascade by PMA, involving but not limited to PKC, caused visible changes in the CD28 signaling complex as detected by in vitro kinase assays. We have previously established that CD28, a 44-kDa disulfide-linked homodimer, migrates as a broad, poorly defined protein band between 40 and 50 kDa following separation by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions as detected following in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 1) (7Hutchcroft J.E. Bierer B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3260-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This diffuse migration pattern is due largely to the existence of multiple heterogeneously glycosylated forms of the receptor, whose extracellular domain has five potential N-linked glycosylation sites (18Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). This characteristic migration pattern of CD28 interfered with further biochemical analysis of the protein. To circumvent this difficulty, we developed an efficient procedure for the in vitro deglycosylation of immunoprecipitated CD28 protein using the endoglycosidase PNGase F to hydrolyze the protein-associated N-glycan chains. CD28 immunoprecipitates were washed repeatedly with RIPA, RIPA containing 1 M NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer (see “Materials and Methods”), washing conditions designed to maximize the removal of any associated proteins coimmunoprecipitating with CD28. The washed, immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured by boiling for 10 min in buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 1%β-mercaptoethanol and renatured in buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The denaturation step both rendered the substrate carbohydrate more accessible to enzymatic activity and helped to prevent proteolysis. The subsequent addition of Nonidet P-40 prevented inhibition of the PNGase F activity by SDS. The proteins were incubated with PNGase F for 1 h at 37°C. The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer, and the deglycosylated proteins were separated on 10.5% SDS-PAGE gels. We first examined the effect of deglycosylation on immunoprecipitates prepared from purified human peripheral T lymphocytes whose cell surface proteins had been labeled with biotin. Treatment of CD28 immunoprecipitates with PNGase F led to a dramatic shift in the migration pattern of CD28 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). The deglycosylated CD28 protein migrated as a well defined 22-kDa protein band. This size was consistent with the predicted molecular mass of 24 kDa for the CD28 monomer, as estimated from the deduced amino acid sequence (18Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The 22-kDa protein band was unique to anti-CD28 mAb immunoprecipitates treated with PNGase F (Fig. 2A, lane 4 compared to lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). As expected, control anti-CD5 mAb immunoprecipitates contained a prominent 65-kDa protein (Fig. 2A, lane 5) that migrated with a molecular mass of 60 kDa following deglycosylation (Fig. 2A, lanes 6) corresponding to CD5. Coomassie blue staining of the proteins bound to the PVDF membranes revealed that the PNGase F treatment shifted completely the migration patterns of the immunoglobulin heavy chains without altering that of the light chains (data not shown). This result confirmed the efficiency of the deglycosylation protocol as well as the absence of detectable proteolysis. Similar results were obtained using CD28 immunoprecipitates prepared from Jurkat T cells and with different CD28 mAbs (data not shown). The identification of the 22-kDa protein as a deglycosylated form of CD28 was confirmed in studies using immunoprecipitates prepared from detergent lysates of Jurkat T cells that had been metabolically labeled with a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Fig. 2B). Once again, PNGase F treatment of CD28 immunoprecipitates converted the ill-defined 40-50-kDa CD28 protein into a sharply focused band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). This band was not present in the absence of CD28 mAb nor in immunoprecipitates prepared using the anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 (data not shown). Identical results were obtained when 1 mM iodoacetamide was included in the lysis, wash, and SDS-sample buffers during the preparation of the CD28 immunoprecipitates to prevent the formation of spurious disulfide-dependent protein interactions (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Further support for our identification of the 22-kDa deglycosylated form of CD28 came from studies in which the proteins present in CD28 immunoprecipitates were visualized directly by silver staining (Fig. 2C) (19Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3710) Google Scholar). A 22-kDa silver-stained protein was present in CD28 immunoprecipitates prepared from Jurkat T cells using either of two different anti-CD28 mAb, 9.3 (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4) and 2E12 (lane 5). The 22-kDa protein was not present upon incubation of cell lysates with protein A-Sepharose in the absence of anti-CD28 mAb (Fig. 2C, lane 1), incubation of anti-CD28 mAb with protein A-Sepharose without cell lysate (Fig. 2C, lane 2) or in anti-CD5 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C, lane 6). The disperse, glycosylated form of CD28 was not detectable by silver stain (data not shown). The silver-stained protein corresponding to CD5 was identified by its phosphorylation as detected by autoradiography (data not shown). Having established the effectiveness of the deglycosylation procedure, we next examined the effect of treating in vitro phosphorylated CD28 immunoprecipitates with PNGase F (Fig. 2D). Human peripheral T cells were incubated for 2 days with 5 ng/ml PMA, then harvested and stimulated with anti-CD28 mAb. The CD28 immune complexes (corresponding to 2 × 107cells) were phosphorylated in vitro, washed stringently, and then treated without (Fig. 2D, lane 1) or with (Fig. 2D, lane 2) PNGase F. The immunoprecipitates were separated on a 10.5% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to PVDF membranes, and alkali-treated, and the phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography. The diffusely migrating CD28 phosphoprotein (Fig. 2D, lane 1, indicated by the bracket) was indeed converted by PNGase F treatment into a well defined, faster migrating form (Fig. 2D, lane 2). These studies demonstrate that CD28 migrates as a sharply focused 22-kDa protein band after in vitro deglycosylation, as confirmed using cell surface biotinylation, [35S]methionine/cysteine metabolic labeling, and silver staining techniques. The development of this procedure has permitted us to continue the characterization of activation-dependent biochemical modifications of CD28. Importantly, there are specific protein bands in the 40-50-kDa region of CD28 immunoprecipitates whose migration patterns are not altered following the deglycosylation protocol (Fig. 2B). These proteins are probably CD28-associated, rather than CD28 itself. Their presence underscores the importance of using a sharply defined, well characterized protein band for the biochemical analysis of activation-dependent modifications of CD28. Preincubation of cells with PMA differentially affects the expression levels of several receptors found on T lymphocytes; PMA has been shown to increase CD28 surface expression while decreasing CD3 expression (2Linsley P.S. Ledbetter J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 191-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) (data not shown). A PMA-induced increase in CD28 expression could have accounted for the PMA-dependent stimulation of CD28 phosphorylation detected in our in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 1). To examine this possibility, we compared the kinetics of these two PMA-dependent effects. CD28 immunoprecipitates were prepared from detergent lysates of Jurkat T cells that had been treated for varying lengths of time with 5 ng/ml PMA and then stimulated with anti-CD28 mAb. As shown in Fig. 3A, incubation of the cells for 2 h with PMA led to a barely detectable increase in immunoprecipitated CD28 protein; longer incubation times resulted in 2-fold (24 h) and 3-fold (48 h) increases in CD28 expression levels as determined by densitometry. Autoradiography of the same gel (Fig. 3B) revealed a strikingly different time course for the effect of PMA on the in vitro phosphorylation of CD28. Although the increase in CD28 protein expression occurred gradually over a 2-day period, PMA treatment caused an abrupt and sustained increase in CD28 phosphorylation, evident within 2 h and continuing for 2 days (Fig. 3B). The kinetics of phosphorylation was rapid: pretreatment of Jurkat T cells with 5 ng/ml PMA for 15 min was sufficient for maximal stimulation of CD28 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C) without discernable changes in the expression levels of CD28 protein (data not shown). In separate studies we have shown that Jurkat T cells had to be pretreated with 5 ng/ml PMA for at least 12 h before an increase in CD28 surface expression was detectable by cell surface immunofluorescence staining (data not shown). Thus, the PMA-dependent increase in CD28 phosphorylation is a rapid event, occurring within minutes of drug treatment and was not the result of increased expression levels of CD28 protein. We performed one-dimensional phosphoamino acid analyses to characterize the effect of different stimulation conditions on the in vitro phosphorylation state of CD28. Anti-CD28 immune complexes (corresponding to 5 × 106 cells) were prepared from Brij 96 lysates of Jurkat T cells that were either untreated (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2) or were preincubated with 5 ng/ml PMA for 5 min on ice (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). Anti-CD28 mAb was used to activate intact"

Recent studies have shown that stimulation of neutrophils with fMLP induces the activation of two members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) family, ERK1 and ERK2, through mechanisms that are not completely understood but may involve the phosphorylation of the adapter protein SHC by the Src-related kinase Lyn. In this study, transfected fibroblasts expressing the rabbit FPR were used to investigate further the role of Lyn and SHC phosphorylation in fMLP-stimulated MAP kinase activation. Stimulation of transfected cells with fMLP resulted in the time- and dose-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ERK1 and ERK2 and the activation of MEK, the MAP kinase/ERK kinase. The activation of both ERKs and MEK was inhibited by preincubation of the cells with pertussis toxin, indicating that activation was dependent upon a Gi/Go-like protein that couples to the receptor. Our data also show that, unlike neutrophils, FPR-transfected fibroblasts do not express the Src-related kinase Lyn. In the absence of Lyn, fMLP stimulation did not result in an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the adapter protein SHC, whereas it was still able to induce MAP kinase activation. These data suggest that Lyn and SHC are not the only upstream signals for activation of the MAP kinase/ERK pathway by fMLP and demonstrate the potential application of the FPR-transfected cells for the delineation of additional signaling mechanisms stimulated by fMLP.

https://openalex.org/W1996107940,"Abstract The construction, expression, and purification of an active Fv fragment of the 0.5β monoclonal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) neutralizing antibody is reported. The interaction between the Fv fragment and the RP135 peptide derived from the V3 loop of gp120 from HIV-1IIIB was studied by varying the salt concentration and by mutating arginine residues in the peptide. The mutations R4A, R8A and R11A (which correspond to residues 311, 315, and 318 in gp120 of HIV-1IIIB) reduce the binding free energy by 0.22 (± 0.20), 4.32 (± 0.16), and 1.58 (± 0.17) kcal mol−1, respectively. The salt-dependent components of their contributions to binding are 0.02 (± 0.22), −0.55 (± 0.18), and −0.97 (± 0.19) kcal mol−1, respectively. The magnitudes of the mutational effects and the extent of shielding by 1 M NaCl suggest that Arg-8 is involved in a buried salt bridge in the peptide-Fv fragment complex, whereas Arg-11 is involved in a more solvent-exposed electrostatic interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2048926606,"Shc proteins (hereafter referred to as ShcA) represent major substrates of tyrosine phosphorylation by a wide variety of growth factors and cytokines. We have recently described a novel ShcA-like protein, ShcC, which like ShcA contains an NH2-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB), a central effector region (CH1) and a COOH-terminal Src homology 2 domain (SH2). Both the SH2 and PTB domains of ShcC bind a similar profile of proteins as the comparable regions of ShcA. In an effort to define the functional differences or similarities between ShcA and ShcC, we have further characterized the PTB domain of ShcC. Using a degenerate phosphopeptide library screen, we show that the PTB domain of ShcC preferentially binds the sequence His-hydrophobic-Asn/hydrophobic-Asn-Pro-Ser/Thr-Tyr(P). This sequence is similar to the binding site for the ShcA PTB domain, suggesting that these two proteins may have overlapping specificities. In addition, random mutagenesis of the ShcC PTB domain has identified several amino acids important for PTB function (Gly32, Glu63, Ala136, Gly139, and Asp140).

INTRODUCTIONTyrosine phosphorylation represents a critical switch in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Phosphorylation of cellular proteins on tyrosine residues creates high affinity binding sites for proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2Src homology 2PTBphosphotyrosine bindingEGF(R)epidermal growth factor (receptor)GSTglutathione S-transferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionkbpkilobase pair(s). domains. SH2 domains recognize tyrosine and the 3-6 amino acids COOH-terminal to the phosphotyrosine. The selectivity of a particular SH2 domain is dictated by these COOH-terminal amino acids. Recently another phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB) has been described(1.Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 3.Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This domain, also known as PI (phosphotyrosine interaction domain) and SAIN (Shc and IRS-1 NPXY binding), recognizes phosphotyrosine in the context of amino acids NH2-terminal to the phosphotyrosine. Thus, PTB and SH2 domains represent distinct protein modules that recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, but under entirely different contexts.PTB domains were first described in the adaptor protein ShcA(1.Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). ShcA represents a major target of tyrosine phosphorylation following stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines(4.Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). Upon activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, ShcA becomes physically associated with the receptor and phosphorylated on tyrosine. This association was initially believed to occur through the SH2 domain of ShcA(5.Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ShcA SH2 binding site on the EGFR was mapped using a combination of in vitro binding and phosphopeptide competition assays(6.Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnick E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Okutani T. Sugimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18674-18678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide selectivity of the ShcA SH2 domain was determined using a degenerate phosphopeptide library screen (8.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky A. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). These results suggested that a number of receptors had putative ShcA binding sites. However, some confusion arose as to the true ShcA binding site due to the finding that ShcA association with the polyoma virus middle T antigen occurred through an Asn-Pro-Thr-Tyr sequence and not the consensus ShcA SH2 binding sequence(9.Campbell K.S. Ogris E. Burke B. Su W. Auger K.R. Druker B.J. Schaffhausen B.S. Roberts T.M. Pallas D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6344-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10.Dilworth S.M. Brewster C.E. Jones M.D. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1994; 367: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, the association of ShcA with a 145-kDa phosphoprotein in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated cells was shown to occur not through the SH2 domain, but rather through the NH2 terminus(2.Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The determination that ShcA contains two distinct phosphotyrosine binding motifs, a COOH-terminal SH2 and a NH2-terminal PTB, provided an explanation for these observations. PTB recognition sites are also present in the nerve growth factor receptor (TrkA), the insuln and insulin-related receptors, interleukin-2 receptor, and the EGFR.We have recently described the identification of two shc-like genes which we called shcB and shcC(11.O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). shcB is nearly identical in sequence to the partial human shc-like gene sck and most likely represents the mouse homolog of this gene(11.O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). shcC, however, has not yet been found in other organisms. In contrast to the wide expression of shcA, shcC is restricted in expression to tissues of neural origin, suggesting a role for this adaptor protein in brain-specific tyrosine kinase signaling. Like ShcA, ShcC contains an NH2-terminal PTB domain, a central proline-rich region (CH1) and a COOH-terminal SH2 domain. In addition, ShcC binds to activated growth factor receptors through both its SH2 and PTB domains. In this report, we have further characterized the PTB domain of ShcC. We have determined the phosphopeptide selectivity of the ShcC PTB domain as well as describe a number of point mutations that dramatically reduce the affinity of the ShcC PTB domain for activated growth factor receptors. These mutations occur in conserved regions of the PTB domain, suggesting an important role for these amino acids in phosphotyrosine recognition and binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Library ScreenThe peptide library used for these studies has the sequence Met-Ala-X-X-X-Asn-X-X-Tyr(P)-X-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys, where X corresponds to any amino acid except for Trp and Cys. This library was synthesized as described previously(8.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky A. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The theoretical degeneracy of this library is 186 or approximately 3.4 × 107. Determination of the binding specificity was done as described previously(12.Songyang Z. Margolis B. Chaudhuri M. Shoelson S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 14863-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Random Mutagenesis and Bacterial ExpressionThe PTB domain of ShcC (amino acids 28-212) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously (11.O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and then either directly subcloned into the pGEX bacterial expression plasmids or randomly mutagenized with hydroxylamine treatment(13.Feig L.A. Corbley M. Pan B.-T. Roberts T.M. Cooper G.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 14.Quilliam L.A. Kato K. Rabun K. Hisaka M. Huff S. Campbell-Burk S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) for sequence analysis, and then subcloned into pGEX. For hydroxylamine mutagenesis, 30 μl of a PCR fragment encoding the PTB domain was mixed with 150 μl of ethylene glycol, then heated to 70°C for 5 min. To this mixture was added 16 μl of hydroxylamine solution (0.5 M hydroxylamine, 0.2 M sodium pyrophosphate, pH 6.0) and then heated to 70°C for 20 min. After this incubation 80 μl of stop solution (0.6 M Tris, pH 8.0, 1.0 M NaCl, 20% acetone) was added and the mutagenized DNA purified over a G-50 Sephadex column equilibrated with TE (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA). The resulting DNA was subcloned into the pCRII vector using the TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Point mutations were identified by dideoxy sequence analysis. All the PTB fragments were subcloned into pGEX vectors as BamHI-EcoRI fragments. Mutants 4a and 4b were constructed by digesting the pGEX-PTB constructs for the wild-type and mutant 4 PTB domains with BstEII, which produces two fragments of approximately 2 kbp (encoding amino acids 28-59 of the PTB) and 3.4 kbp (encoding the amino acids 60-213 of the PTB domain). Mutant 4a was constructed by ligating the 3.4-kbp wild-type fragment with the 2-kbp fragment from mutant 4. Mutant 4b was constructed by ligating the 3.4-kbp fragment from mutant 4 with the 2-kbp wild-type fragment. Plasmid constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of each mutation. Mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α at 37°C and purified on glutathione-agarose beads after induction with IPTG for 3 h. Beads containing GST-PTB were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 20, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, resuspended in a 50% slurry, and then stored at −70°C. Aliquots of each PTB domain were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the gel stained with Coomassie to assess concentrations.In Vitro Binding AssaysA431 cells (a human epidermoid carcinoma) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin in the presence of 5% CO2. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was a kind gift of Dr. H. Shelton Earp and used at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Briefly, lysates were prepared from A431 cells stimulated with EGF for 2 min at room temperature as described previously(11.O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Approximately equal amounts of each GST-PTB were incubated with equivalent amounts of lysate from EGF stimulated A431 cells at 4°C for >90 min. These mixes were then centrifuged and pellets washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 20, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl in 2 × SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Immobilon filters. Filters were probed with either anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20, Transduction Laboratories) to detect the phosphorylated EGFR or anti-GST antibodies (GST(Z-5)HRP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to assure equal amounts of fusion protein were used in the binding experiments. Blots were developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Corp.). Signals were quantitated using a Bio-Rad phosphorimager. Relative binding affinities were determined by dividing the anti-Tyr(P) signal by the anti-GST signal. The resulting ratio for each sample was divided by the ratio for the wild-type PTB domain to normalize the samples relative to the wild-type PTB.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA number of groups have defined the sequence requirements of a phosphopeptide for binding the ShcA PTB domain (12.Songyang Z.

Given our interest in further defining functional differences or similarities between ShcA and ShcC, we have examined the peptide specificity of bacterially expressed ShcC PTB using a degenerate phosphopeptide library screen (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using this strategy, the ShcA PTB was shown to select phosphopeptides containing the sequence Asn-Pro-X-Tyr(P)-Phe-X-Arg with the strongest selectivity at positions −3 and −2 relative to the Tyr(P) (12.Songyang Z.

Indeed, this motif (Asn-Pro-X-Tyr(P)) is present in a number of receptor tyrosine kinases, including TrkA, EGFR, and the insulin receptor as well as polyoma virus middle T-antigen.Tabled 1Figure 1:Alignment of PTB domains.

In addition, most of the selectivity of PTB domains appears to be dictated by residues NH2-terminal to Tyr(P). Therefore, to increase the sensitivity of our experiments and to examine the importance of residues at −6 to −4, the −3 position of the phosphopeptide library was fixed as Asn. The library consisted of peptides containing the sequence Met-Ala-X-X-X-Asn-X-X-Tyr(P)-X-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys, where X corresponds to any amino acid except for Trp and Cys. The ShcC PTB domain selects phosphopeptides containing the sequence His-hydrophobic-Asn/hydrophobic-Asn-Pro-Ser/Thr-Tyr(P) (Fig. 2 and Table 1). There also appears to be some selectivity at the +1 position for small chain amino acids (Table 1). These data suggest that the ShcC PTB may bind to similar phosphoproteins as the ShcA PTB. In agreement with these data, we have shown that the ShcA and ShcC PTB domains bind in vitro to the activated NGFR and EGFR in growth factor-stimulated cells with relatively equal affinities and this binding can be competed away with a phosphopeptide modeled on the Tyr490 juxtamembrane autophosphorylation site of TrkA(11.O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, both ShcC and ShcA PTB domains bind a 170-kDa phosphoprotein in EGF-stimulated A431 cell lysates (Fig. 3A). The identity of the protein is currently unknown. Thus, the ShcC PTB domain shares common recognition specificities with the corresponding PTB domain of ShcA.Figure 2:Phosphopeptide selectivity of the PTB domain of ShcC. A degenerate phosphopeptide library was used to examine the specificity of the ShcC PTB domain (see “Experimental Procedures”). The peptides that bound to immobilized GST-ShcC PTB were purified and sequenced, and the sequence of the purified peptides was compared with that of the starting peptide library. The data were normalized such that a value of 1 or less indicates no selectivity for a given amino acid(33.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar). A, B, C, D, E and F show, respectively, the selectivity ot the Tyr(P)-6, Tyr(P)-5, Tyr(P)-4, Tyr(P)-2, Tyr(P)-1, and Tyr(P)+1 positions.

In the absence of structural information regarding the importance of particular regions of the PTB domain, we employed a random mutagenesis approach with the aim of identifying amino acids important for PTB function. Using hydroxylamine mutagenesis and PCR, we isolated a number of PTB mutants, several of which are impaired in their ability to bind the phosphorylated EGFR (Table 2). Mutant 2, which contains a single point mutation (E63G), has dramatically reduced binding (>10-fold) to the EGFR as compared with the wild-type PTB (Fig. 3). This Glu residue at position 63 of ShcC (amino acid 80 of ShcA) is conserved in 14 of 22 PTB domains described thus far (Fig. 1 and (19.Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)). Four of the remaining eight PTB domains possess a conserved Asp. These findings suggest that a negatively charged side chain amino acid at this position plays a critical role in the recognition of tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates of the ShcC PTB domain.Tabled 1In addition to the E63G single mutation, PTB mutant 7, which possesses two tandem amino acid substitutions (G139E/D140N), also has dramatically reduced binding (>10-fold) to phosphotyrosine substrates (Fig. 3). These two amino acids occur in a region of the PTB domain which is highly conserved in Shc family members as well as other PTB containing proteins (Fig. 1). In particular, Asp is present in 15 of the 22 PTB domains(19.Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20.Yajnik V. Blaikie P. Bork P. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1813-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role in PTB function. PTB mutant 4 also has dramatically reduced affinity (>9-fold) for the activated EGFR. This mutant contains three amino acid substitutions (G32R, A136T, C166R; Table 2). The Gly is conserved in 11 of 19 PTB domains, and the Ala is present in 6 of 22 PTB domains, suggesting a conserved role for these amino acids in PTB function. The Cys, however, is only present in 3 of 21 PTB domains, which suggests that this amino acid may not be critical for PTB function(19.Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20.Yajnik V. Blaikie P. Bork P. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1813-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have separated this triple mutant into a single mutant containing the G32R mutation and a double mutant containing the A132T and the C166R mutations. The relative binding affinities of these two mutants compared with the triple mutant and wild-type PTB domains were determined. Although the triple mutant had approximately a 90% decrease in binding the activated EGFR, neither the single nor double mutant were severely impaired in binding. The G32R mutation resulted in approximately a 20% decrease in binding, and the A136T/C166R double mutation resulted in approximately a 50% reduction in binding. We have not assessed the individual contributions of the A136T or C166R mutations. We believe the severity of the triple mutant is due to a synergistic effect of the three mutations on PTB binding function. We do not believe that the triple mutant is defective in binding due to a decrease in the stability of the protein, since equivalent amounts of fusion protein are obtained for mutants 4, 4a, and 4b (data not shown).During the course of this study, the NMR solution structure of the PTB domain of ShcA complexed to a TrkA phosphopeptide was described(21.Zhou M.-M. Meadows R.P. Logan T.M. Yoon H.S. Wade W.S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7784-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of the PTB domain is composed of two antiparallel β-sheets formed by a series of seven β strands and three α helices. The overall topology of the PTB domain bears a striking resemblance to that of another modular domain, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, although these two domains lack any sequence homology. The ShcA and ShcC PTB domains share a high degree of sequence identity. Overall these two domains are 78% identical particularly in the regions that form specific contacts with the phosphopeptide as determined by NMR(21.Zhou M.-M. Meadows R.P. Logan T.M. Yoon H.S. Wade W.S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7784-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For example, the β5 strand is 100% identical in ShcA and ShcC and forms four contacts with the phosphopeptide ligand (21.Zhou M.-M. Meadows R.P. Logan T.M. Yoon H.S. Wade W.S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7784-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the solution structure of the ShcC PTB domain may be very similar to that of ShcA. Therefore, we have analyzed our mutations using the ShcA PTB structure as a framework for comparison. The E63G mutation occurs in the middle of α2 helix, which connects the β1 and β2 strands. These β strands comprise part of a β-sheet that forms a hydrophobic pocket into which the phosphopeptide binds. Thus, the E63G mutation likely disrupts important ionic interactions with the α2 helix, thereby abrogating phosphopeptide recognition. The G139E/D140N mutations occur in a loop between the β5 and β6 strands. The β5 strand forms several contacts with the phosphopeptide backbone(21.Zhou M.-M. Meadows R.P. Logan T.M. Yoon H.S. Wade W.S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7784-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gly139 appears important for forming a proper turn between these two β strands, which allows for their antiparallel arrangement. Thus, the G139E/D140N double mutant likely disrupts these contacts by restricting the ability of the loop to form a turn, thereby disrupting the alignment of β5 and β6 and diminishing the affinity of the PTB for phosphopeptide.The three mutations present in PTB mutant 4 occur in different regions of the PTB domain. Of particular interest is the fact that the A136T mutation occurs in the β5 strand, which forms part of the cleft into which the phosphotyrosine binds(21.Zhou M.-M. Meadows R.P. Logan T.M. Yoon H.S. Wade W.S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7784-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Several amino acids in this β strand, including Ala139, are in close proximity with the phosphopeptide. Mutation of Ala139 likely disrupts these contacts, thereby abrogating binding to the activated EGFR. Thus, the A136T mutation likely accounts for the majority of the reduction in EGFR binding by mutant 4. The A136T/C166R double mutant does not appear to be as impaired in binding as the triple mutant (Fig. 3C). Although we have not assessed the individual effects of these two substitutions, we believe that the C166R mutation may have some compensatory effect in the context of the double mutant. This compensation in binding may not occur in the context of the triple mutant.In addition to mutations which affect phosphotyrosine binding, a number of PTB mutants are unaffected in their interaction with the activated EGFR (Fig. 3). Many of these mutations represent conservative substitutions that likely do not have a profound affect on the structure or interactions with other amino acids within the PTB domain itself or the phosphopeptide. Many of the nonconservative substitutions occur in loop regions that tend to be more resistant to mutational effects due to the ability of these regions to move freely in space.We have identified several mutations in the PTB domain of a novel adaptor protein, ShcC, which dramatically reduce the affinity of its PTB domain for the activated EGFR. Based on the predicted structure of the ShcA PTB domain, these mutations likely disrupt regions important in phosphopeptide recognition and binding. Several groups have identified additional mutants in the ShcA PTB domain that affect PTB binding to phosphotyrosine containing proteins(18.van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G. Lai V.K.-M. Stephens R. White M. Kaplan D. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20.Yajnik V. Blaikie P. Bork P. Margolis B. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7784-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Yajnik et. al. (20.Yajnik V. Blaikie P. Bork P. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1813-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) independently isolated an Ala to Thr mutation at amino acid 153 in ShcA, which is identical to the A136T mutation present in mutant 4 of ShcC. This mutation resulted in a 74% reduction in binding of the ShcA PTB to the activated EGFR, further supporting the notion that the A136T mutation of mutant 4 is indeed the critical amino acid mutation affecting binding.Mutation of Arg175 of ShcA to either Glu, Met, or Lys completely abolishes phosphotyrosine binding, suggesting a critical role for this Arg in substrate binding(18.van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G. Lai V.K.-M. Stephens R. White M. Kaplan D. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21.Zhou M.-M. Meadows R.P. Logan T.M. Yoon H.S. Wade W.S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7784-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on the recently described structure of the ShcA PTB domain, Arg175 directly participates in binding the phosphotyrosine residue of the phosphopeptide ligand. Interestingly, this Arg is not absolutely conserved in all PTB domains(19.Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This finding is in contrast to SH2 domains, which contain an absolutely conserved Arg, mutation of which blocks SH2 binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins(22.Marengere L.E. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22779-22786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Waksman G. Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In addition to Arg175, mutation of Phe198 drastically reduces binding (<1% of wild type)(20.Yajnik V. Blaikie P. Bork P. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1813-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Phe198, in contrast to Arg175, is conserved in the majority of PTB domains described thus far(19.Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20.Yajnik V. Blaikie P. Bork P. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1813-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the IRS-1 PTB domain binds to a similar sequence as the ShcA and ShcC PTB domains, yet shares no apparent sequence homology. These observations suggest that although different PTB domains may lack primary sequence homology, they may adopt similar three-dimensional structures. Indeed, the PTB domain of ShcA and the PH domain of pleckstrin share a similar three-dimensional structure in the absence of sequence homology(21.Zhou M.-M. Meadows R.P. Logan T.M. Yoon H.S. Wade W.S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7784-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PTB domains lacking a comparable Arg175 as found in the PTB domains of Shc family members may adopt a different structure and, thus, employ a different mechanism for phosphopeptide recognition and binding. Determining the structures of other PTB domains will address these possibilities.We have examined the peptide selectivity of the ShcC PTB domain. This PTB domain has a similar selectivity as compared with the PTB domain of ShcA. Similar results were obtained with the SH2 domains of Shc family members(11.O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The similarity in the sequence and the peptide selectivities of both ShcA and ShcC PTB and SH2 domains suggests that these two adaptor proteins may share overlapping functions, but in different cell types. Indeed, both proteins interact with similar receptors and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in vitro(11.O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The identification of mutant PTB domains presents the possibility of designing ShcC dominant interfering mutants that may block signaling from tyrosine kinases as well as other proteins that signal through Shc family members.In addition to binding tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, the PTB domain of ShcA has also been shown to bind phospholipids(21.Zhou M.-M. Meadows R.P. Logan T.M. Yoon H.S. Wade W.S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7784-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the SH2 domains of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, as well as Src and Abl, have been shown to bind phospholipids(24.Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This interaction with lipids provides a possible explanation for how ShcA may translocate to the membrane to activate Ras in the absence of direct binding to activated growth factor receptors(25.Li N. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3457-3465PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Gotoh N. Tojo A. Muroya K. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In addition, the interaction of ShcA with phospholipids may play a role in the regulation of phospholipid metabolism. INTRODUCTIONTyrosine phosphorylation represents a critical switch in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Phosphorylation of cellular proteins on tyrosine residues creates high affinity binding sites for proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2Src homology 2PTBphosphotyrosine bindingEGF(R)epidermal growth factor (receptor)GSTglutathione S-transferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionkbpkilobase pair(s). domains. SH2 domains recognize tyrosine and the 3-6 amino acids COOH-terminal to the phosphotyrosine. The selectivity of a particular SH2 domain is dictated by these COOH-terminal amino acids. Recently another phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB) has been described(1.Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 3.Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This domain, also known as PI (phosphotyrosine interaction domain) and SAIN (Shc and IRS-1 NPXY binding), recognizes phosphotyrosine in the context of amino acids NH2-terminal to the phosphotyrosine. Thus, PTB and SH2 domains represent distinct protein modules that recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, but under entirely different contexts.PTB domains were first described in the adaptor protein ShcA(1.Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). ShcA represents a major target of tyrosine phosphorylation following stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines(4.Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). Upon activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, ShcA becomes physically associated with the receptor and phosphorylated on tyrosine. This association was initially believed to occur through the SH2 domain of ShcA(5.Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ShcA SH2 binding site on the EGFR was mapped using a combination of in vitro binding and phosphopeptide competition assays(6.Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnick E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Okutani T. Sugimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18674-18678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide selectivity of the ShcA SH2 domain was determined using a degenerate phosphopeptide library screen (8.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky A. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). These results suggested that a number of receptors had putative ShcA binding sites. However, some confusion arose as to the true ShcA binding site due to the finding that ShcA association with the polyoma virus middle T antigen occurred through an Asn-Pro-Thr-Tyr sequence and not the consensus ShcA SH2 binding sequence(9.Campbell K.S. Ogris E. Burke B. Su W. Auger K.R. Druker B.J. Schaffhausen B.S. Roberts T.M. Pallas D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6344-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10.Dilworth S.M. Brewster C.E. Jones M.D. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1994; 367: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, the association of ShcA with a 145-kDa phosphoprotein in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated cells was shown to occur not through the SH2 domain, but rather through the NH2 terminus(2.Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The determination that ShcA contains two distinct phosphotyrosine binding motifs, a COOH-terminal SH2 and a NH2-terminal PTB, provided an explanation for these observations. PTB recognition sites are also present in the nerve growth factor receptor (TrkA), the insuln and insulin-related receptors, interleukin-2 receptor, and the EGFR.We have recently described the identification of two shc-like genes which we called shcB and shcC(11.O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). shcB is nearly identical in sequence to the partial human shc-like gene sck and most likely represents the mouse homolog of this gene(11.O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). shcC, however, has not yet been found in other organisms. In contrast to the wide expression of shcA, shcC is restricted in expression to tissues of neural origin, suggesting a role for this adaptor protein in brain-specific tyrosine kinase signaling. Like ShcA, ShcC contains an NH2-terminal PTB domain, a central proline-rich region (CH1) and a COOH-terminal SH2 domain. In addition, ShcC binds to activated growth factor receptors through both its SH2 and PTB domains. In this report, we have further characterized the PTB domain of ShcC. We have determined the phosphopeptide selectivity of the ShcC PTB domain as well as describe a number of point mutations that dramatically reduce the affinity of the ShcC PTB domain for activated growth factor receptors. These mutations occur in conserved regions of the PTB domain, suggesting an important role for these amino acids in phosphotyrosine recognition and binding."

Several species possess an additional mechanism, responding to variations in light conditions by making different types of LH2 complex. However, the study of these complexes in isolation and in the native membrane environment has not been possible. Therefore two LH2 gene pairs from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, associated, respectively, with high light (pucBAa) and low light (pucBAd) growth conditions, were expressed in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The high light LH2 complex PucBAa was synthesized at appreciable levels in R. sphaeroides, had near-infrared absorption bands at ~800-855 nm, and was able to transfer energy efficiently to the native LH1 complex. In contrast, the low light complex PucBAd was found at comparatively low levels, had absorption bands at ~797-830 nm, and did not transfer energy to the native LH1 complex efficiently. These observations are discussed in the light of site-directed studies on the R. sphaeroides LH2 complex, and the recently elucidated Rhodopseudomonas acidophila 10050 LH2 structure. Potentially important residues for energy transfer between LH2 and LH1 complexes are identified, as well as some of the factors that influence stability and assembly of LH2 complexes, such as the N-terminal sequences of their protein subunits and their carotenoid binding sites.

The high light LH2 complex PucBAa was synthesized at appreciable levels in R. sphaeroides, had near-infrared absorption bands at ~800-855 nm, and was able to transfer energy efficiently to the native LH1 complex. In contrast, the low light complex PucBAd was found at comparatively low levels, had absorption bands at ~797-830 nm, and did not transfer energy to the native LH1 complex efficiently. These observations are discussed in the light of site-directed studies on the R. sphaeroides LH2 complex, and the recently elucidated Rhodopseudomonas acidophila 10050 LH2 structure. Potentially important residues for energy transfer between LH2 and LH1 complexes are identified, as well as some of the factors that influence stability and assembly of LH2 complexes, such as the N-terminal sequences of their protein subunits and their carotenoid binding sites. In photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by carotenoid and (bacterio)chlorophyll molecules, most of which are found in the light-harvesting (LH) 1The abbreviations used are: LHlight harvestingLLlow lightHLhigh lightRCreaction centerBChlbacteriochlorophyllPCRpolymerase chain reactionWTwild typeR.RhodobacterRv.RubrivivaxRps.Rhodopseudomonas. complexes, and is transferred via the different pigments to the photochemical reaction center (RC) with high efficiency (see, for example, van Grondelle et al. (28van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Gillbro T. Sundström V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 1-65Crossref Scopus (1013) Google Scholar)). The best characterized light-harvesting system, from a structural, spectroscopic, and genetic standpoint is that of the purple bacteria, and in general it consists of two types of antenna complex LH2 (B800-850) and LH1 (B875) (see, for example, Hunter (18Hunter C.N. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht The Netherlands1995: 473Google Scholar)). A number of recent developments have provided more information on these bacterial light-harvesting complexes. First, there has been a breakthrough in the x-ray crystallography of the LH2 complex from Rhodopseudomonas acidophila, which has built upon earlier studies (Cogdell and Hawthornthwaite, 5Cogdell R.J. Hawthornthwaite A.M. Deisenhofer J. Norris J.R. The Photosynthetic Reaction Centre. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 23-42Google Scholar; Papiz et al., 23Papiz M.Z. Hawthornthwaite A.M.

Biol. 1989; 209: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and has progressed to the extent that a structure has been determined to atomic resolution (McDermott et al., 21McDermott G. Prince S. Freer A.A. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A.M. Papiz M.Z. Cogdell R.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 517-521Crossref Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). Second, a heterologous expression system which supports the assembly of a functional “foreign” light-harvesting complex has been created. It has been used to produce Rhodobacter sphaeroides strains that can heterologously synthesize the LH2 complexes encoded by the “silent” genes puc2BA from Rps. acidophila strain 7050 and by the pucBA genes from Rubrivivax gelatinosus (Fowler et al., 10Fowler G.J.S. Gardiner A.T. Mackenzie R.C. Barratt S.J. Simmons A.E. Westerhuis W.H.J. Cogdell R.J. Hunter C.N. J. Biol.

It is well documented that the relative amount of LH2 that is formed in R. sphaeroides is dependent on the light conditions, so that under low light conditions it is the major antenna component (Aagaard and Sistrom, 1Aagaard J. Sistrom W.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1972; 15: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, several other species, such as Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Rps. acidophila, respond to variations in light conditions by making different types of LH2 complex (Tadros and Waterkamp, 25Tadros M.H. Waterkamp K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Hawthornthwaite and Cogdell, 13Hawthornthwaite A.M. Cogdell R.J. Scheer H. The Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 493Google Scholar). It is also well documented that while there is one type of LH2-encoding gene pair in R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus, namely pucBA, multiple versions of these genes are present in Rps. palustris and Rps. acidophila, some of which are not expressed at detectable levels (Tadros and Drews, 26Tadros M.H. Drews G. Drews G. Dawes E.A. Molecular Biology of Membrane-Bound Complexes in Phototrophic Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1990: 181-192Crossref Google Scholar; Tadros et al., 27Tadros M.H.

Res. 1993; 38: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The expression of members of these multicopy gene families in R. sphaeroides would allow the individual pucBA gene pairs to be studied in isolation from the others and would also provide a means of studying the gene pairs most associated with given growth conditions. Therefore it was decided to attempt to express heterologously members of the multigene LH2 family from Rps. palustris in R. sphaeroides, and to characterize the resulting LH2 complexes with a variety of steady-state spectroscopic techniques. Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria broth. R. sphaeroides strains were grown under semiaerobic/dark conditions in M22+ medium (Hunter and Turner, 16Hunter C.N. Turner G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 1471-1480Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1% casamino acids for growth in liquid culture. For E. coli, tetracycline was used at a concentration of 10 µg/ml. For R. sphaeroides, antibiotic concentrations were tetracycline, 1 µg/ml; neomycin, 20 µg/ml; and streptomycin, 5 µg/ml. The medium used for the growth of Rps. palustris was the RCVYE-based medium described in Elder et al. (6Elder D.J.E. Morgan P. Kelly D.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 111: 23-30Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The terms “low light” (LL) and “high light” (HL) used throughout this work are equivalent to 0.1-0.2 watt m−2 and 100-200 watt m−2, respectively. The bacterial strains used in this work include E. coli strain S17-1 (thi pro hsdR− hsdM+ recA RP4-2 (Tc::mu km::Tn7); Simon et al. (24Simon R. Preifer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5658) Google Scholar), R. sphaeroides strains DD13 (genomic deletion of both pucBA and pufBALMX; insertion of SmR and KmR genes, respectively) and DBCΩ (genomic deletion of pucBA genes and replacement by a of SmR cassette leaving only the native LH1-RC core) (Jones et al., 19Jones M.R. Fowler G.J.S. Gibson L.C.D. Grief G.G. Olsen J.D. Crielaard W. Hunter C.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The mobilizable plasmids used were based on pRKCBC1 (TcR; derivative of pRK415; insertion of a 4.4-kilobase pair fragment encompassing pucBAC); briefly this expression vector, described by Jones et al. (19Jones M.R. Fowler G.J.S. Gibson L.C.D. Grief G.G. Olsen J.D. Crielaard W. Hunter C.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), contains the pucBA genes as a 420-base pair KpnI-BamHI insert. For the construction of the vectors for heterologous expression of the “foreign” LH2 genes, pRK(pucBAa) and pRK(pucBAd), the appropriate pucBA gene pair (containing similarly engineered KpnI-BamHI ends) were cloned into plasmid pRKCBC1 in place of the wild-type R. sphaeroides pucBA genes so that transcription through these Rps. palustris genes is driven by the R. sphaeroides puc promoter (see, for example, Fowler et al. (10Fowler G.J.S. Gardiner A.T. Mackenzie R.C. Barratt S.J. Simmons A.E. Westerhuis W.H.J. Cogdell R.J. Hunter C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23875-23882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and Gibson et al. (12Gibson L.C.D. McGlynn P. Chaudhri M. Hunter C.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3171-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). The Rps. palustris strain 2.1.6, described in van Mourik et al. (29van Mourik F.M. Hawthornthwaite A.M. Vonk C. Evans M.B. Cogdell R.J. Sundström V. van Grondelle R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 85-92Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was a gift from Prof. Richard Cogdell, Glasgow University, while the Rps. palustris strain DEP100, described in Elder et al. (6Elder D.J.E. Morgan P. Kelly D.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 111: 23-30Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. David Kelly, Sheffield University. The following PCR oligonucleotides, based on the published sequences from Tadros et al. (27Tadros M.H. Katsiou E. Hoon M.A. Yurkova N. Ramji D.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and Tadros and Waterkamp (25Tadros M.H. Waterkamp K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), were used to amplify the Rps. palustris LH2 genes from wild-type Rps. palustris strain 2.1.6 genomic DNA; (a) for pucBAa, 5′-CACAGGTACCTTATTCTCAAAATGGCTG-3′ and 5′-GCGCGGATCCTTAGCCGACGTTGACCGA-3′, (b) for pucBAd, 5′-CACAGGTACCTTATTATCCATGGTAG-3′ and 5′-GCGCGGATCCTTAGACGGCCTTGATCG-3′ where the bases in boldface type are the KpnI or BamHI restriction sites and the underlined bases are ribosome binding sequences. The constructs were introduced into R. sphaeroides by conjugative transfer. The mobilizable plasmids to be introduced into R. sphaeroides were first transformed into E. coli strain S17-1 (Simon et al., 24Simon R. Preifer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5658) Google Scholar). Matings were then performed as described in Hunter and Turner (16Hunter C.N. Turner G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 1471-1480Google Scholar). Transconjugants were grown aerobically in the dark on plates of M22+ medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. In the case of matings performed to complement deletion/insertion mutants in trans using plasmids based on pRKCBC1, tetracycline (1 µg ml−1) was included in the growth medium. Membranes were prepared from cells grown semiaerobically in the dark by disruption in a French pressure cell and were purified by harvesting from the interface of sucrose step gradients (15%/40%, w/w) after centrifugation in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 27,000 rpm (60,000 × g) for 10 h. For the LH2 membrane samples, protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (2Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad assay system. Following conjugative transfer, antibiotic-resistant colonies were screened for the presence or absence of LH2 light-harvesting complexes using a Guided Wave model 260 fiberoptic spectrophotometer (Guided Wave Inc., El Dorado Hills, CA), which was also used to measure the absorbance spectra of LH2 membranes. The fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Spex FluoroLOG spectrofluorimeter (Spex Industries, Inc., Edison, NJ). Fig. 1 shows the sequence alignments for the LH2 α and β polypeptides encoded by the genes used in this study; the polypeptides are aligned around the conserved histidine residues which coordinate the B850 pigments (McDermott et al., 21McDermott G. Prince S. Freer A.A. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A.M. Papiz M.Z. Cogdell R.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 517-521Crossref Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). The two LH2 complexes chosen for the present study, encoded by the genes pucBAa and pucBAd, are described in Tadros and Waterkamp (25Tadros M.H. Waterkamp K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Tadros et al. (27Tadros M.H. Katsiou E. Hoon M.A. Yurkova N. Ramji D.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for Rps. palustris strain 1e5; the protein sequences of these complexes (PucBAa and PucBAd) match those given in the Ph.D. thesis of Evans (7Evans, M. B., 1989, The Structure and Function of the Light-Harvesting Antenna Complexes from Purple Photosynthetic Bacteria. Ph.D. thesis, University of Glasgow.Google Scholar) for Rps. palustris strain French, but with a different nomenclature. In this latter work PucBAa is named α1, and PucBAd is named α2. (Protein sequences for the LH2 complexes for Rps. palustris strain French are also given in Brunisholz and Zuber (3Brunisholz R.A. Zuber H. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1992; 15: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).) The pucBAa and pucBAd genes from the Rps. palustris strain 2.1.6 were isolated using PCR, cloned into the pRKCBC1 expression plasmid, and sequenced to check their authenticity (see “Experimental Procedures”); after conjugative transfer into R. sphaeroides these genes were recovered and resequenced. Translation of the gene pairs gave no differences from the PucBAa and PucBAd protein sequences published by Tadros et al. (27Tadros M.H. Katsiou E. Hoon M.A. Yurkova N. Ramji D.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Using the same PCR oligonucleotides, we attempted to isolate analogous LH2 genes from Rps. palustris strain DEP100; only the oligonucleotides designed to the pucBAa gene gave a positive PCR fragment (data not shown); those designed to the pucBAd gene did not. The room temperature absorbance spectra of membranes prepared from LH2-only transconjugant strains are shown in Fig. 2, and they clearly demonstrate the presence of the Rps. palustris LH2 complexes in the R. sphaeroides background strain DD13. The spectra are scaled to reflect the level of LH2 complex per amount of cellular membrane as quantified by total membrane protein, and it is clear that although the LH2 complex arising from the gene pair pucBAa (Fig. 2b) is present at levels comparable to that of WT R. sphaeroides (Fig. 2a), that arising from the gene pair pucBAd is present at comparatively low levels (Fig. 2c). The spectrum of the PucBAd LH2 membranes (Figs. 2c and 3c) showed an attenuated band at 800 nm relative to that seen in whole cell samples (data not shown); the B800 band is labile, and pigment is apparently lost during the membrane preparation. Furthermore, the absorbance properties of the heterologously synthesized LH2 complexes differed from those of WT R. sphaeroides LH2 (λmax = 800, 850 nm; Fig. 2a). The LH2 complex from the pucBAa gene pair showed absorbance peaks in the near infrared at 800 and 855 nm (Fig. 2b), while that from the pucBAd gene pair showed equivalent peaks at approximately 797 and 830 nm (Fig. 2c). In order to measure the ability of the 800-nm absorbing pigments to transfer energy to the B850 pigments within the heterologously synthesized Rps. palustris PucBAa and PucBAd LH2 complexes, excitation spectra in the near infrared region of the spectrum were measured (Fig. 3). For both Rps. palustris complexes the matching profiles of the absorption and emission spectra suggest that the complexes are able to transfer energy from their B800 to their B850 pigments. The ability of the peripheral LH2 antenna to transfer energy to the core LH1 complex was monitored by exciting the LH2 complex at various wavelengths, from 750 to 900 nm, while monitoring any fluorescence emitted from the LH1 complex at 910 nm. Fig. 4 shows the results of such an excitation experiment at 77 K on membranes from strains containing the heterologously synthesized Rps. palustris PucBAa and PucBAd LH2 complexes, both in the presence of R. sphaeroides LH1 and RC. For the Rps. palustris PucBAa LH2 complex the excitation spectrum profile is closely matched by the 1 −% transmission profile (1 − T) (Fig. 4a), and the extent of the alignment between the two spectra suggests that this LH2 complex is able to transfer energy to the R. sphaeroides LH1 complex. A lack of energy transfer from the foreign LH2 species to the native LH1 complex would have resulted in the absence of a peak in the excitation spectrum at 800 nm, for example. In contrast, Fig. 4b shows the excitation and (1 − T) spectra from the Rps. palustris PucBAd LH2 complex; there are several regions of difference between them, most noticeably in the 800-nm region (indicated by an arrow). The absence of a peak at 800 nm in the excitation spectrum comparable to that in the (1 − T) spectrum indicates that there is a reduced contribution from the B800 bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) of the Rps. palustris PucBAd LH2 complex to the 77 K fluorescence emitted from the R. sphaeroides LH1 complex at 910 nm, compared to the results from the PucBAa LH2 complex (Fig. 4a). This suggests that energy transfer from the B800 absorbance band to the LH1 complex is less efficient in the PucBAd LH2 complex than in the PucBAa LH2 complex, and since it has already been established that B800 to B850 transfer in the PucBAd LH2 is efficient (see Fig. 3 above), it seems probable that it is B850 to LH1 transfer that is affected. In order to investigate this phenomenon further, emission spectra were recorded at 77 K from the same two samples (Rps. palustris PucBAa and PucBAd LH2) after excitation into both the Bchl Qx band at 590 nm and into the Bchl B800 Qy band at 790 nm (Figs. 5a and 5b; for each sample the absorption spectrum is shown on the left and the two emission spectra on the right of the figure). Excitation into the Bchl Qx band at 590 nm results in both the LH2 and LH1 complexes receiving excitation energy, while excitation into the Bchl B800 Qy band at 790 nm leads to most of the excitation energy going solely to the B800 band of the LH2 complex. In this way it was hoped to distinguish the contribution which direct LH1 excitation makes to LH1 emission from that due to indirect LH1 excitation by energy transfer from LH2. For the LH2 complex PucBAa (Fig. 5a), excitation into the Qx and Qy bands produced nearly identically shaped emission spectra having single peaks with a λem of ~897 and ~899 nm, respectively. However, after excitation at 790 nm there is no separate emission peak or shoulder in the 874-nm region which might be associated with independent LH2 emission (see Fig. 3a); thus, it can be concluded that most of the energy directed into the Rps. palustris PucBAa LH2 Qx band was efficiently transferred to the R. sphaeroides LH1 complex. In contrast, for the LH2 complex PucBAd (Fig. 5b), excitation into the Qx and Qy bands produced differently shaped emission spectra; after excitation at 590 nm (lower emission trace), an emission peak at 902 nm was seen (with the hint of a peak in the 850-nm region), while after excitation at 790 nm (upper emission trace), two distinct peaks were seen with λem values of ~855 and ~900 nm. The extra emission peak seen at ~855 nm after excitation at 790 nm can be identified as the emission from the Rps. palustris PucBAd LH2 band (see Fig. 3c) absorbing at ~830 nm (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 5b) and indicates that less of the excitation energy into the LH2 Qy band was transferred to the R. sphaeroides LH1, as compared to the situation seen with the PucBAa LH2 complex (Fig. 5a). From the fluorescence data given in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, it seems likely that energy transfer from the Rps. palustris PucBAa LH2 to R. sphaeroides LH1 is more efficient than is seen for the Rps. palustris PucBAd LH2, and it is interesting to speculate as to the reasons. Although the Rps. palustris PucBAd LH2 appears to be present at a lower level than PucBAa LH2, this does not necessarily make energy transfer less efficient, as has been seen previously with heterologously synthesized LH2 complexes from Rps. acidophila (Fowler et al., 10Fowler G.J.S. Gardiner A.T. Mackenzie R.C. Barratt S.J. Simmons A.E. Westerhuis W.H.J. Cogdell R.J. Hunter C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23875-23882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One possibility is that a blue-shifted B850 band poses some sort of disadvantage, and that the 830-nm B850 of the Rps. palustris PucBAd LH2 cannot transfer energy as efficiently to the R. sphaeroides B875 LH1 complex as a WT B850 band because of the reduced overlap between the donor emission and acceptor absorption bands (see, for example, Hess et al. (14Hess S. Visscher K.J. Sundström V. Fowler G.J.S. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8300-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)). In order to test this, it was decided to examine the emission properties of a mutant R. sphaeroides LH2 complex, namely one in which the Tyrα13 residue is changed to a Phe; one of the reasons for picking this particular mutant LH2 is that it has absorption peaks at 800 and 839 nm at 77 K, providing a blue-shifted B850 peak for comparison with the 830-nm peak in the PucBAd LH2 complex. The absorption and emission spectra for the Tyrα13→ Phe LH2 complex (LH1 and RC are also present) are shown in Fig. 5c; the experimental conditions were identical to those used in obtained Fig. 5, a and b. The absorption spectrum of the Tyrα13→ Phe LH2 complex shows a pronounced B850 peak at ~839 nm at 77 K compared to the situation for the PucBAd LH2 complex in which the 830-nm peak (shown by the arrow in Fig. 5b) is barely visible. It is therefore significant that while only a small emission shoulder is seen at ~860 nm for the Tyrα13→ Phe LH2 complex on excitation into its B800 band (Fig. 5c, upper emission trace), there is in contrast a pronounced emission peak observed at ~855 nm for the PucBAd LH2 complex (Fig. 5b, upper emission trace). One reason for choosing Rps. palustris, extending previous work on Rps. acidophila (Fowler et al., 10Fowler G.J.S. Gardiner A.T. Mackenzie R.C. Barratt S.J. Simmons A.E. Westerhuis W.H.J. Cogdell R.J. Hunter C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23875-23882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was its ability to modify the cellular absorbance spectrum according to the incident light intensity. However, since several gene pairs are present and transcribed in Rps. palustris, it was thought prudent to identify the LH2 gene/protein pucBA/PucBA pair most associated with LL growth conditions. According to the work of Tadros et al. (27Tadros M.H. Katsiou E. Hoon M.A. Yurkova N. Ramji D.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the three LH2βα genes transcribed under LL conditions for Rps. palustris strain 1e5 are pucBAb, pucBAd, and pucBAe, while Evans (7Evans, M. B., 1989, The Structure and Function of the Light-Harvesting Antenna Complexes from Purple Photosynthetic Bacteria. Ph.D. thesis, University of Glasgow.Google Scholar) gives as a rough estimate of the stochiometries of the polypeptides retrieved from Rps. palustris cells (strain French) grown under LL conditions α1:α2:α3:α4 = 2:6:1:1. The protein sequence given in this latter work for α2, the polypeptide with the highest apparent level in Evans (7Evans, M. B., 1989, The Structure and Function of the Light-Harvesting Antenna Complexes from Purple Photosynthetic Bacteria. Ph.D. thesis, University of Glasgow.Google Scholar), is the same as that of PucBAd in Tadros et al. (27Tadros M.H. Katsiou E. Hoon M.A. Yurkova N. Ramji D.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These two sets of data convinced us that the pucBAd gene pair would be one of those associated with LL growth conditions. With respect to identifying a single gene pair most associated with HL growth conditions, the situation is less clear. Tadros et al. (27Tadros M.H. Katsiou E. Hoon M.A. Yurkova N. Ramji D.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) concluded that all five LH2βα genes, pucBAa, pucBAb, pucBAc, pucBAd, and pucBAe, are transcribed under HL conditions for Rps. palustris strain 1e5, while the work by Evans and co-workers gives as HL polypeptide stochiometries α1:α2:α3:α4 = 2:2:1:1 for Rps. palustris strain French. However, according to Tadros and co-workers only three of the LH2 complexes, PucBAb, PucBAd, and PucBAe, are transcribed under LL conditions, and so for the purposes of the present work we assumed that either PucBAa or PucBAc LH2 complex was most associated with HL growth conditions. On comparing protein sequences, it became apparent that there was no equivalent to the PucBAc complex mentioned in Evans (7Evans, M. B., 1989, The Structure and Function of the Light-Harvesting Antenna Complexes from Purple Photosynthetic Bacteria. Ph.D. thesis, University of Glasgow.Google Scholar), but it can be seen that the sequence for PucBAa is identical to that of the LH subunit α1 given in the Evans thesis. Therefore, since α1 shows a relatively high proportion of the total in the protein analysis of membranes from HL grown cells (Evans, 7Evans, M. B., 1989, The Structure and Function of the Light-Harvesting Antenna Complexes from Purple Photosynthetic Bacteria. Ph.D. thesis, University of Glasgow.Google Scholar), and since according to Tadros and co-workers (1993) pucBAa gives a stronger Northern blot signal in preparations from high light-grown cells, it was decided to investigate the gene pair pucBAa on the assumption that it encoded an LH2 more associated with HL growth conditions. The αβ protein pairs shown in Fig. 1 were thought to be good candidates for heterologous synthesis in R. sphaeroides, because they show some significant homology to the native proteins. One potential problem was that the N terminus of the PucBHL subunit was considerably shortened compared to that of the R. sphaeroides β-subunit, but previous success with another shortened β-subunit, that encoded by the silent puc2BA gene from Rps. acidophila strain 7050 (Fowler et al. 10Fowler G.J.S. Gardiner A.T. Mackenzie R.C. Barratt S.J. Simmons A.E. Westerhuis W.H.J. Cogdell R.J. Hunter C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23875-23882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), has demonstrated that such subunits can assemble a functional complex. As a control experiment, we also investigated a different strain of Rps. palustris called DEP100 (Elder et al., 6Elder D.J.E. Morgan P. Kelly D.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 111: 23-30Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) which, whether grown under HL or LL conditions, gave the same absorption spectrum. Unlike the Rps. palustris strain 2.1.6 used in this work, only a spectrum resembling HL grown Rps. palustris was seen with strain DEP100, whatever the light conditions (data not shown). Using the PCR oligonucleotides designed for the isolation of the genes pucBAa and pucBAd, we attempted to isolate analogous LH2 genes from Rps. palustris strain DEP100. Only the oligonucleotides designed to the pucBAa gene gave a positive PCR fragment (data not shown), leading us to suppose that an equivalent to the pucBAd gene was not present in DEP100; this preliminary observation might explain why DEP100 shows only a HL absorption spectrum. A comparison of the protein sequence identity values shown in Fig. 1 shows that the PucBADEP100 LH2 and the PucBAa LH2 are very similar, and this suggests that these LH2 complexes have similar roles in the two Rps. palustris strains. The differences in the near infrared absorption bands seen for the two heterologously synthesized Rps. palustris LH2 complexes PucBAd and PucBAa (Fig. 2) can probably be explained in the light of their different protein sequences. Previous work has established that the two residues at positions 13 and 14 on the α-subunits of the LH2 complexe"
https://openalex.org/W2044122657,"The far upstream region (−1.2-0.9 kilobase pairs) of the mouse glycophorin gene contains the locus control region (LCR)-like region, which acts as an erythroid-specific enhancer dependent on chromosomal integration in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that this region binds six nuclear factors. The binding of GATA-1 to corresponding sites did not show any change before or after induction with dimethyl sulfoxide, but the binding of Spi-1/PU.l and an unidentified factor called glycophorin regulatory element binding factor (GRBF) showed a change during induction. While binding activity of Spi-l/PU.l dropped soon after induction, the GRBF activity increased after induction when expression of the glycophorin gene began. After identification of the consensus binding site of GRBF, we cloned cDNA for that factor by Southwestern method, and it was identified as a previously reported transcription factor, delta, a murine form of YY-l which is a versatile transcription factor. Mutation analysis in the delta/YY-1 binding site within the LCR-like region indicated that delta/YY-1 acts as a regulatory protein in combination with the E-box-binding protein that binds to the neighboring sequence.

Mouse glycophorin is a red blood cell membrane protein and a good erythroid-specific marker protein such as hemoglobin. To understand the mechanisms underlying the stage- and tissue-specific expression of erythroid-specific genes, we cloned a mouse glycophorin gene which is homologous to human glycophorin A or B (1Matsui Y. Natori S. Obinata M. Gene. 1989; 77: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and examined its expression in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) 1The abbreviations used are: MELmurine erythroleukemiaMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxideLCRlocus control regionGBRFglycophorin regulatory element binding factorEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaybpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s). cell differentiation. Upon treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), MEL cells undergo terminal differentiation into red blood cells and induce a number of different erythroid-specific genes (2Friend C. Scher W. Holand J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 68: 378-382Crossref Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Glycophorin gene expression precedes that of globin gene in MEL cell differentiation (3Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. McDonagh K.T. Nienhuis A.W. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). By nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5′ upstream region of the mouse glycophorin gene (4Terajima M. Matsui Y. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Obinata M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and its transient transcription assay (5Terajima M. Nemoto Y. Obinata M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we have shown that the erythroid-specific promoter element consisted of the basal promoter containing GGTGGG and GATA motifs, and the distal elements containing binding motifs for two erythroid-specific nuclear factors GATA-1 and NF-E2. In addition, we found a locus control region (LCR)-like region that was reported in the human β-globin gene cluster. The LCR-like region located far upstream of the mouse glycophorin gene seemed to act as an enhancer of the erythroid-specific promoter in the stable transfection assay, but not in the transient transfection assay (5Terajima M. Nemoto Y. Obinata M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The role of LCR of the human β-globin gene cluster located far upstream of ε-globin gene in the regulation of developmental switching and erythroid-specific expression of β-like globin genes was demonstrated by analysis using transgenic mice and MEL cells (6Chang J.C.

The LCR of the human β-globin genes includes two tandemly arranged NF-E2/AP-1-binding motifs and GATA-1-binding motif. The LCR-like region in the mouse glycophorin gene has a structure similar to globin LCR.

Culture and induction of MEL cells were performed as described previously (12Kume T.U. Takada S. Obinata M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For preparation of the nuclear extracts (13Dignam J.D. Levobitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9101) Google Scholar), the cells were cultivated for 2 days with or without 1.4% Me2SO. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM EDTA-0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, the nuclear pellet was washed twice with the same buffer and resuspended in the nuclear buffer, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 400 mM NaCl. The elution of proteins was performed on ice for 30 min, and the nuclear extract was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min.

For DNase I footprinting assay, a 284-bp DNA fragment from −1185 to −901 bp of the glycophorin gene containing the LCR-like region was 32P-labeled according to standard procedures. DNase I footprinting reaction mixtures (50 µl) contained 36 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 57 mM KCl, 9 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10,000 cpm of the DNA fragment, 50 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and nuclear extracts (4 µg) (14Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). After incubation on ice for 15 min, various concentrations of DNase I were added. Following incubation on ice, 6 volumes of solution containing 20 mM EDTA, 185 µM NaCl, 1% SDS, 0.8 µg of proteinase K were added to stop the reaction. After incubation at 42°C for 30 min, DNAs were extracted by phenol-chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. The samples were heated to 95°C for 3 min in a sequencing dye solution and separated in an 8% sequencing gel. Gels were fixed and dried prior to autoradiography. EMSA was performed as described by Sigh et al. (15Sigh H. Sen R. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Nature. 1986; 19: 154-158Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For probe preparation, oligonucleotides synthesized by a DNA synthesizer were annealed and 5′-end labeled with [32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Japan) according to standard procedures. The labeled DNA fragment (10,000 cpm) was incubated in a final volume containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 3 µg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 4 µg of nuclear extract proteins. Following 15 min of incubation on ice, electrophoresis was performed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × Tris borate-EDTA. Gels were dried prior to autoradiography. The binding reaction mixtures were UV-irradiated in the presence or absence of competitor oligonucleotides by UV Stratalinker (Stratagene), and the cross-linked protein-DNA complexes were separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. The λgtll cDNA library was constructed from cDNA made from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the uninduced MEL cells by oligo(dT) priming. We initially screened this cDNA library by the method of Vinsion et al. (10Vinsion C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) with three ligated copies of a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide e which was the GRBF recognition sequence site determined by the gel shift analysis. Purified phage plaques that gave positive signals with the oligonucleotide e and gave negative signals with the oligonucleotide Mb were selected as positive clones. An EcoRI fragment containing the cDNA sequence was excised from the selected λgtll phage and inserted into the EcoRI site of transcriptional vector BSK(+). The 5′-flanking sequence (1.3 kb) containing the LCR-like region and the transcription start site of the mouse glycophorin gene or its site-directed mutants (Δdelta/YY-1; -CCATTT- to -CCAGGT-) (ΔE-box; -CACGTG- to -CGATCG-) and the 0.9-kb sequence deleting the LCR-like region (ΔLCR) were subcloned and linked to luciferase gene. Cells were transfected by a modification of the recommended protocol of the synthetic, cationic lipopolyamine molecule (Transfectam reagent, Promega). MEL cells were split 3 h before transfection and replated onto poly-L-lysine (Sigma)-coated 60-mm diameter dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish (4-8 dishes for each test plasmid) in ES-fetal bovine serum. For transfection, cells were washed three times with ES and then were incubated with 5 µg of supercoiled plasmid DNA and Transfectam reagent, 25 µg in opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) (1.5 ml) for 12 h at 37°C. After the opti-MEM I was removed, the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C in ES-fetal bovine serum (6 ml/plate) to express the selection marker, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase. For the selection, G418 (Geneticin, Sigma) was added to the culture medium at 400 µg/ml. After 9 days of incubation, scores of G418-resistant colonies were observed. To avoid clonal variation and positional effect, the cells were resuspended and subcultured in G418-containing ES-fetal bovine serum for 7 more days. Four to eight independent transfected populations were established for each test plasmid (wild-type, Δdelta/YY-1, ΔE-box, and ΔLCR). Each population was split, and one half was cultured in ES-fetal bovine serum while the other half was induced to differentiate by addition of 1.4% Me2SO for 4 days. Luciferase assay (16Kiliang L. Bing Z. Patrica P. Taric E. George S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8207-8211Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was performed at 4 days according to the protocol of the luciferase assay kit (Toyo Ink Co. Tokyo). Six days after induction of differentiation, benzidine staining was done to estimate the extent of differentiation. To measure levels of endogenous glycophorin mRNA, total RNAs from MEL cells were prepared by guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform procedure. Ten µg of RNA from each sample were electrophoresed in a denatured 1% gel agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with a mouse glycophorin cDNA probe (1Matsui Y. Natori S. Obinata M. Gene. 1989; 77: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) radiolabeled with a random primer extension kit (DuPont) in the hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 1 × Denhardt's reagent, 20 mM NaHPO3, pH 6.5, 100 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.1% SDS). After overnight incubation at 42°C, the membrane was washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature and in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 60°C, then autoradiographied. Mouse glycophorin LCR-like region spanning nucleotide −1185 to −901 (Fig. 1) was analyzed for the binding of nuclear factors by DNase I footprinting assay. The 284-bp fragment labeled at either end was incubated with nuclear extracts from the induced or uninduced MEL (B8/3 line) cells and digested with DNase I. The regions presenting protection from DNase I digestion (footprints) or increased sensitivity are shown in Fig. 2. Analysis of the sequences within the footprint regions revealed four putative erythroid-specific binding sites; two GATA motifs and two AP-1/NF-E2-like motifs in the region assigned as II in Fig. 2, A and C. Sequence of the general form (T/A)GATA(A/G) binds the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-1 (4Terajima M. Matsui Y. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Obinata M. J. Biochem.

Of two potential GATA-1 binding sites referred to a nonconsensus site (AGATAC) and a consensus site (TGATAG), the footprinting revealed a protection in the non consensus site, but did with no difference between the induced and uninduced MEL cells. Two AP-1/NF-E2-like consensus motifs were found upstream of the two GATA elements, as reported for the erythroid-specific promoter of the human prophobillinogen deaminase gene (20Mignotte V. Eleouet J.F. Raich N. Romeo P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6548-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and for the LCR of the human β-globin gene (3Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. McDonagh K.T. Nienhuis A.W. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). These motifs are not completely fitted to the NF-E2 consensus motif (T/C)GCTGA(G/C)TCA(C/T) which Andrews et al. (21Andrews N.C. Erdjument Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) recently reported. Between the two motifs, footprinting revealed the hypersensitive site only in the 5′ side of the upstream AP-1/NF-E2-like motifs (Fig. 2C). The Spi-1/PU.1 consensus motif (PU box) (22Klemenz M. Mackercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (749) Google Scholar), GAGGAA resides in the central portion of the LCR-like region. The PU box in the noncoding strand was protected in the uninduced extract (DMSO (−) in Fig. 2B), but was not in the induced extract (DMSO (+) in Fig. 2B). In addition, footprinting revealed that a hypersensitive site (an arrowhead in Fig. 2A, III) in the coding strand at the 3′-side of the PU box was more apparent in the uninduced cells than in the induced cells. The feature of the nuclear factor binding of the PU box was similar to that observed in the PU box within the intervening sequence of the mouse β-globin gene (23Galson D.L. Hensfold J.O. Bishop T.R. Schalling M. D'Andrea A.D. Jones C. Auron P.E. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2929-2941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Spi-1/PU.1 activity reduced after induction of MEL cell differentiation. The E-box (CACGTG) motif which is the binding site for basic helix-loop-helix protein (24Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 25Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar) was found in the downstream of the Spi-1/PU.1 element. While footprinting revealed the hypersensitive site and the protection in the noncoding strand of the region containing E-box element (see Fig. 2B), more apparent protection was seen in the coding strand in the induced extract than the uninduced one (Fig. 2A). This apparent difference indicated induction of nuclear factors that bind the E-box and/or the neighboring element after MEL cell differentiation. From these results we tentatively concluded that the LCR-like region contains at least six binding sites, in two of which the protein binding is changed after MEL cell differentiation (Fig. 1). To identify which individual proteins interact with each of the binding sites, many oligonucleotides were used as probes and competitors in EMSA; in addition to the GATA-1 site, two binding sites in particular in which protein binding is changed between the induced and uninduced MEL cells were extensively studied. LG-oligo (−1104 to −1090) of the LCR-like region containing a GATA motif showed the retarded bands (one major slow and one minor fast migrating bands) and they were competed with excess amounts of either GA-oligo containing a consensus GATA-1 site or LG-oligo, but not with unrelated LP-oligo, indicating that the GATA-motif within the LCR-like region can bind GATA-1. LP-oligo (−1071 to −1044) containing a PU.1 site within the LCR-like region showed three retarded bands which could be competed to the same extent with excess amounts of either PU-oligo containing the Spi-1/PU.1 consensus binding site or LP-oligo, but not with unrelated LN-oligo (Fig. 3B), indicating that the PU.1 site within the LCR-like region can bind PU.1. PU.1 binding activities were titrated with PU-oligo (Fig. 3C). Two major retarded bands (shown by arrowheads) were detected in the MEL cell extract as well as in the NS-1 cell extract, in which PU.1 activity was reported (22Klemenz M. Mackercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (749) Google Scholar). MEL cell extracts contained more abundant PU.1 activity than NS-1 cell extracts. Binding with the induced MEL cell extract showed a five times weaker band than with the uninduced one at the same position. This result is consistent with that observed in DNase I footprinting assay. Oligonucleotide V (−982 to −947) which contains the E-box gave rise to three retarded bands in the MEL extract (Fig. 3D). The top band competed with Hm which includes the E-box consensus site (CACGTG) (Fig. 3E). The second band (arrowhead in the figure) was competed with Vm which possesses a mutation in the E-box consensus site and thus cannot bind E-box binding proteins. The third band did not competed with E, thus this complex may be nonspecific binding. Interestingly, the proportion of the second band increased after induction (approximately 3-fold) and was highest 2 days after induction when glycophorin gene expression began (26Shoji W. Ohmori Y. Obinata M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1993; 84: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D). Thus, the second band may contain a key factor for glycophorin gene expression and we called this factor GRBF. In order to determine the consensus binding sequence of GRBF, we performed competitor scanning experiments by adding five different oligonucleotides (Fig. 4A). Under these conditions, efficient competition of the second band was only achieved with oligonucleotide e, while the top band competed with c and d, both of which contain the E-box consensus sequence (Fig. 4A). The competition experiments using mutated e oligonucleotides (Ma, Mb, and Mc) indicated that consensus binding sequence of this factor requires the TTT sequence since Mb and Mc did not bind (Fig. 4B). The EMSA with mutated e oligonucleotides (Md, Me, and Mf) indicated that CCA is required for the binding (Fig. 4C). In the gel shift assay, oligonucleotide e showed a single band that was inducible in the Me2SO-treated cells, and Me oligonucleotide may be an up-mutant because the band in the same migration was stronger than that of e oligonucleotide, while Md was a weak mutant (Fig. 4C). Mutated Mf oligonucleotide showed a strong band whose migration was different from that of oligonulceotide e and did not change during induction of MEL cells, thus Mf might bind a different factor. Combining these results, we concluded that this inducible DNA-binding factor called GRBF could bind to CCATTT as the most probable consensus sequence. EMSA with e oligonucleotide in the MEL cell extracts showed that GRBF was induced by the addition of Me2SO and was maximum on day 2 (Fig. 4D). To determine the molecular weight of GRBF, we performed UV cross-linking analysis (Fig. 5). A mixture of 32P-labeled probe e and MEL cell nuclear extracts was irradiated with short wavelength UV light for 5 min. Then the mixture was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. To demonstrate the sequence-specific nature of the protein, we added a 500-fold excess of cold competitors to the binding reaction mixture. We observed four bands without competitor, although two of them with higher molecular weight were not diminished by competitor F. Moreover, the band in the lowest molecular weight (arrowhead) was diminished by competitor e but not by b which cannot bind GRBF. This indicates that the lowest band is the complex formed with GRBF. As the size of this band was 70 kDa, the molecular mass of this protein is expected to be about 60 kDa. Identification of the consensus binding sequence of GRBF made it possible to isolate its cDNA clone by Southwestern cloning method using the expression library constructed in λgt11 vector from the mRNA of MEL cells. By screening with the labeled oligonucleotides containing the CCATTT consensus sequence for GRBF we obtained clones, and the specificity of binding of these clones was confirmed with mutant oligonucleotides including the up mutant, Me and the weak mutant Md (data not shown). The nucleotide sequence determination of the longest cDNA clone indicated that the longest open reading frame completely matched with the known DNA binding factor, delta (27Hariharan N. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9799-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), a murine form of YY-1 (28Shi Y.E. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), also called NF-E1 (29Park K. Atchison M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9804-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) or UCRBP (30Flanagan J.R. Becker K.G. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Driggers P.H. Levi B.Z. Appella E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The molecular size of delta is about 65 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and resembles that of GRBF, which our UV cross-linking analysis identified as about 60 kDa (Fig. 5). To confirm the binding of delta/YY-1 to the CCATTT within the LCR-like region of the mouse glycophorin gene, the antibody was made against bacterially produced delta/YY-1 protein in rabbits and added to the gel shift assay (Fig. 6). The gel shift band corresponding to delta/YY-1 binding of the MEL cell extract disappeared by addition of the anti-delta/YY-1 antibody, while anti-c-Myc antibody showed no effect. The result indicated that delta/YY-1 is really bound to the LCR-like region. Then we examined the functional involvement of delta/YY-1 on the LCR-like activity of the mouse glycophorin gene by stably transfecting the mutants in the delta/YY-1 binding site and the neighboring E-box binding site into MEL cells (Fig. 7). The 5′-flanking sequence (1.3 kb) containing the LCR-like region and the transcription start site of the mouse glycophorin gene and the 0.9-kb sequence deleting the LCR-like region (ΔLCR) were subcloned and linked to the luciferase gene. For introducing a mutation in the delta/YY-1 binding site, CCATTT was changed to CCAT which could not bind to delta/YY-1 as shown in Fig. 4 (Mb mutant) and for introducing a mutation in the E-box binding site, CACGTG was completely changed to CG. The plasmid DNAs were introduced into MEL cells by a lipopolyamine method to obtain the stable transformants. To minimize the variation of each transformant, four to eight independent neomycin-resistant transformants for each plasmid were pooled, and the transcriptional activities in the induced and uninduced cells were measured by luciferase assays at 4 days of culture. To confirm that the cells selected after transfection did not change their properties, levels of endogenous glycophorin mRNAs before and after induction in each pool of transformants were measured by Northern blotting (Fig. 7D). The result showed that induction of the endogenous glycophorin gene was not altered in these transformants. Induction of differentiation monitored by benzidine staining in each transformant also showed that the transfection did not affect extent of differentiation in these transformants (data not shown). When the luciferase activities were measured at 4 days of culture, the deletion in the LCR-like region (ΔLCR) reduced its transcriptional activity to 50% of that of the 1.3-kb sequence containing the LCR-like region (−) (Fig. 7B). The mutation in the delta/YY-1 binding site (Δdelta/YY-1 in Fig. 7A) itself reduced to 60% that of the original activity. On the other hand, mutation in the neighboring E-box biding site (ΔE-box) resulted in complete loss of LCR-like activity. Activity of the mutations in both sites resumed to a level similar to that of the deletion in the delta/YY-1 binding site alone. To confirm the change in the transcriptional activities in these transformants, the time course of luciferase activities after induction was measured (Fig. 7C). The result showed that luciferase activities were dependent on induction. The LCR-like region found in the far upstream region (−1.2 to −0.9 kb) of the mouse glycophorin gene has been shown to contain several erythroid-specific nuclear factor binding sites as observed in the human β-globin gene. Deletion analysis of the 5′ far upstream region of this gene conferred high levels of expression in a stable transfection assay, but, interestingly, when tested in transient expression assays in MEL cells, it showed no stimulation of transcriptional activity (5Terajima M. Nemoto Y. Obinata M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as shown in the LCR of β-globin gene (31Talbot D. Philipson S. Fraser P. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, the far upstream region of the mouse glycophorin gene was clearly distinguished from general enhancers, which were originally defined in transient transcription assays (16Kiliang L. Bing Z. Patrica P. Taric E. George S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8207-8211Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is likely that this region may activate the glycophorin gene on the chromatin structure like the LCR of the β-globin gene (7Fraser P. Hurst J. Collis P. Grosveld F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3503-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 31Talbot D. Philipson S. Fraser P. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 32Tuan D.Y.H. Solomon W.B. London I.M. Lee D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2554-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To understanding the mechanism of the differentiation-specific gene regulation by the glycophorin LCR-like region, it is important to investigate the nuclear proteins that bind to it before and after induction of MEL cell differentiation. Our DNase I footprinting and EMSA consistently showed that several nuclear factors bound to the LCR-like region (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). We showed the presence of binding sites for the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-1, and they did not show any change in their binding activities before or after induction of MEL cells. Although the hypersensitive site was observed in the 5′ side of the upstream AP1/NF-E2-like motifs in the two AP1/NF-E2-like motifs within this region (Fig. 2C), suggesting the nuclear factor binding, we could not observed clear gel shift bands with these DNA sequences. 2Y. Nemoto, unpublished observation. The co-localization of these binding sites in the glycophorin LCR-like region was very similar to the globin gene LCR (3Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. McDonagh K.T. Nienhuis A.W. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 6Chang J.C. Liu D. Kan U.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Of interest is the apparent difference in the binding activity of GATA-1 to the GATA site within the LCR-like region and the promoter region of the glycophorin gene during MEL cell differentiation. It is likely that GATA-1 binding is affected by the neighboring sequence (5Terajima M. Nemoto Y. Obinata M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast to these elements, two binding sites for Spi-1/PU.1 and GRBF showed a change. Spi-1 is an oncogene activated during leukemogenesis induced by Friend virus (35Moreau-Gachelin F. Tavitian M. Tambourin P. Nature. 1988; 331: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and is identified as PU.1, which is a transcription factor and one of the protein products of the ets protooncogene family (22Klemenz M. Mackercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 36Goebl M.G. Cell. 1990; 29: 1165-1166Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Moreau-Gachelin F. Ray D. Mattei M.G. Tambourin P. Tambourin A. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1449-1456PubMed Google Scholar). The binding activity of PU.1 dropped after induction as shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and these results are consistent with our previous report that levels of PU.1 mRNA dropped rapidly when these cells were treated with Me2SO (26Shoji W. Ohmori Y. Obinata M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1993; 84: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We speculate that Spi-1 itself acts as a negative factor for transcription and/or that its binding to the element may interfere with the binding of other nuclear factors to it. The globin gene seems not to contain the PU.1 binding site within the LCR-like region; however, its binding site was found in the 3′-enhancer of the mouse β-globin gene (23Galson D.L. Hensfold J.O. Bishop T.R. Schalling M. D'Andrea A.D. Jones C. Auron P.E. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2929-2941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that PU.1 acts as a negative factor for erythroid-specific gene expression, as it has a regulatory function in other hematopoietic cells such as T cells (22Klemenz M. Mackercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Another factor with binding activity that changes after induction is GRBF. We concluded by gel shift competition analysis that the consensus sequence for GRBF is CCATTT. The GRBF activity increased after induction of MEL cells when the transcription of glycophorin began to rise (1Matsui Y. Natori S. Obinata M. Gene. 1989; 77: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Shoji W. Ohmori Y. Obinata M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1993; 84: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). By screening with the CCATTT consensus sequence, we isolated the cDNA clone for GRBF and surprisingly, found that GRBF was identical to delta, a murine form of YY-1 (28Shi Y.E. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) which is a versatile transcription factor that has a zinc finger DNA binding domain. The band shift with oligonucleotide e in the MEL cell extract was retarded with the addition of rabbit anti-delta/YY-1 antibody. Delta/YY-1 is involved in negative and positive regulation of transcription of many genes (38Shrivastava A. Saleque S. Kalpana G.V. Artandi S. Gof F.P. Calame K. Science. 1993; 262: 889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For example, two YY-1 binding sites at −60 and at +1 of the adeno-associated virus P5 promoter mediate repression of transcription by YY-1, an effect which is relieved by E1A (28Shi Y.E. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), and delta activates transcription of mouse ribosomal protein genes that lack a TATA box from binding sites upstream of the transcription start site (27Hariharan N. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9799-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Its binding sites were found in many genes (27Hariharan N. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9799-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 28Shi Y.E. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T.

Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), in the upstream conserved region of MuLV (30Flanagan J.R. Becker K.G. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Driggers P.H. Levi B.Z. Appella E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and in one of c-myc upstream elements (40Riggs K. Saleque S. Wong K. Merrell K.T. Lee J. Shi Y. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) are CCATTT, which is completely matched with that of GRBF, while those found in immunoglobulin κ3′ gene enhancer (29Park K. Atchison M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9804-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and in ribosomal protein rpL30 gene (27Hariharan N. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9799-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) are CCATCT. By comparison with the functional core of the globin LCR-HS3, we found that the well conserved element FP-6 (33Bruce A.H. Anne M.M. Timothy J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5771-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) has CCTTT, which resembles to a consensus core sequence for delta/YY-1. Our preliminary gel shift assay with the FP-6 sequence probe demonstrated that delta/YY-1 can bind to this element (data not shown). This result suggests that delta/YY-1 may play an important role in regulating LCR-like activity in erythroid differentiation. This possibility was examined by stable transfection of the point mutants in the GRBF binding site and the neighboring E-box binding site within the LCR-like region of the mouse glycophorin gene. The stable assays showed that a point mutation in the delta/YY-1 binding site reduced its LCR activity to 60% of original activity. More interestingly, a mutation in the E-box binding site completely lost the LCR-like activity. Based on these results, the following models may be plausible. 1) YY-1 is a transcriptional activator which inhibits transcription in the absence of E-box binding protein. 2) E-box binding protein is a transcriptional activator which is nonfunctional without YY-1, and YY-1 by itself acts as an inhibitor. In either model, it is clear that delta/YY-1 regulates the LCR-like activity in combination with the E-box binding protein. It is interesting to learn how the activity of delta/YY-1 can be modulated during induction of MEL cells. The nucleotide sequence adjacent to the delta/YY-1 binding site consisted of E-box binding site whose binding activity did not change before or after induction (Fig. 3B). It is important to identify the E-box-binding protein in MEL cells. Since the E-box found in the LCR-like region is CACGTG which is the consensus binding site for Max/Max and Myc/Max (42Blackwell T.K. Kretzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenmann R.N. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1149-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 43Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Science. 1991; 251: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), it would be of interest to know whether c-Myc could bind to this element, because overexpressed c-Myc interferes with induction of differentiation of MEL cells (12Kume T.U. Takada S. Obinata M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the association of c-Myc with YY-1 inhibits YY-1 activity (38Shrivastava A. Saleque S. Kalpana G.V. Artandi S. Gof F.P. Calame K. Science. 1993; 262: 889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We thank Drs. A. Kuroiwa, M. Yamamoto, and H. Sasaki for helpful discussions."
