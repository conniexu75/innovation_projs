https://openalex.org/W1595716614,"A 25-kDa antioxidant enzyme that provides protection against oxidation systems capable of generating reactive oxygen and sulfur species has previously been identified. The nature of the oxidant eliminated by, and the physiological source of reducing equivalents for, this enzyme, however, were not known. The 25-kDa enzyme is now shown to be a peroxidase that reduces H2O2 and alkyl hydroperoxides with the use of hydrogens provided by thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH. This protein is the first peroxidase to be identified that uses thioredoxin as the immediate hydrogen donor and is thus named thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx). TPx exists as a dimer of identical 25-kDa subunits that contain 2 cysteine residues, Cys47 and Cys170. Cys47-SH appears to be the site of oxidation by peroxides, and the oxidized Cys47 probably reacts with Cys170-SH of the other subunit to form an intermolecular disulfide. Mutant TPx proteins lacking either Cys47 or Cys170, therefore, do not exhibit thioredoxin-coupled peroxidase activity. The TPx disulfide is specifically reduced by thioredoxin, but can also be reduced (less effectively) by a small molecular size thiol. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae thioredoxin reductase gene was also cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino sequence was shown to be 51% identical with that of the Escherichia coli enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1554880727,"We previously reported that anti-epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor monoclonal antibody (mAb) 225 can block receptor activation and inhibit proliferation of tumor cells bearing EGF receptors. To further explore the mechanism of mAb-mediated growth inhibition, we compared the capacities of bivalent 225 mAb and 225 F(ab')2, and monovalent 225 Fab' fragment to block ligand binding to EGF receptors, inhibit activation of receptor tyrosine kinase by exogenous and endogenous ligand, produce receptor dimerization, down-regulate receptors, and inhibit proliferation of cultured A431 squamous carcinoma cells. Unlike 225 mAb and 225 F(ab')2, 225 Fab' fragment was a poor inhibitor of A431 cell proliferation. The weak antiproliferative capacity of 225 Fab' was not due to depletion of active fragment from cultures. When cells were exposed to exogenous EGF, monovalent 225 Fab' remaining in conditioned culture medium could act as well as the bivalent forms of mAb to block binding and tyrosine kinase activation by exogenous EGF. However, unlike the bivalent forms, 225 Fab' fragment was unable to induce receptor dimerization and down-regulation, and it lacked the capacity to block autocrine activation of EGF receptors by endogenous ligand. These deficiencies were corrected by addition of rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody, which also enabled 225 Fab' fragment to inhibit cell proliferation. We conclude that in A431 cells, inhibition of autocrine-stimulated proliferation by anti-EGF receptor mAbs requires antibody bivalency, which provides the capacity to produce EGF receptor dimerization accompanied by receptor down-regulation. These properties may explain the greater efficacy of bivalent mAb and F(ab')2, compared with monovalent Fab' fragment, in inhibiting proliferation of a variety of malignant and nonmalignant cultured cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1555922270,"The receptor for the protease thrombin is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, but is activated by a unique proteolytic mechanism. The irreversibility of this proteolytic mechanism and the fact that the ligand is tethered to its receptor raise special questions about inactivation of cleaved receptors and recovery of thrombin responsiveness. We compared the intracellular trafficking of the thrombin receptor to that of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor in transfected Rat1 fibroblasts. In unstimulated cells almost all beta 2 receptors were located on the plasma membrane; by contrast, part of a cell's thrombin receptors were found in an intracellular membrane compartment which co-localized with Golgi markers. Stimulation by agonist caused internalization and subsequent recycling of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor, but most activated thrombin receptors were internalized and targeted to lysosomes. The intracellular pool of thrombin receptors found in unstimulated cells was protected from activation by thrombin, but was translocated to the plasma membrane upon activation of cell surface thrombin receptors. Replenishment of plasma membrane thrombin receptors correlated with recovery of thrombin responsiveness. These observations reveal a novel trafficking mechanism for resensitizing the thrombin receptor as opposed to the internalization/recycling pathway of other G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1521799099,"15-Lipoxygenase (15-LO) catalyzes hydroperoxidation of fatty acids, a reaction of potential relevance to inflammation, membrane remodeling, and atherosclerosis. In human leukocytes, 15-lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid produces 15-(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and lipoxin A4, which suppress white cell chemotaxis, adherence, and activation, and antagonize proinflammatory leukotrienes. Interleukin (IL)-13, produced by T-helper subset 2 (TH-2) lymphocytes, specifically and potently induced 15-LO gene expression and enzyme activity in human monocytes. Among other TH-2 lymphokines, this induction of 15-LO is shared by IL-4 but not by IL-10. Interferon-gamma, a product of TH-1 lymphocytes, blocked IL-13-mediated induction of 15-LO. The induction of the anti-inflammatory 15-LO pathway by IL-13 reveals a new facet of IL-13 biology that supports its role as a cytokine with potential to down-regulate inflammatory pathways. The contrasting effects of interferon-gamma and IL-13 on 15-LO induction demonstrate mechanisms by which T-lymphocyte subsets may modulate macrophage/monocyte function in inflammation or atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2142848145,"Certain guanyl diamines are effective inhibitors of deoxyhypusine synthase (Jakus, J., Wolff, E. C., Park, M. H., and Folk, J. E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 13151-13159), the first enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual amino acid hypusine (N epsilon-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine). Evidence that hypusine is implicated in cell growth prompted this study of the cellular effects of these inhibitors. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, inhibition of hypusine biosynthesis followed by progressive arrest in cellular proliferation was observed with both N-mono- and N,N'-bisguanyl derivatives of 1,6-diaminohexane, 1,7-diaminoheptane, and 1,8-diaminooctane. Cells treated with these compounds showed no significant change in polyamine distribution, suggesting that the observed growth inhibition is not mediated through an interference with polyamine metabolism. N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane, the most potent inhibitor of deoxyhypusine synthase both in vitro and in cells, exhibited the highest antiproliferative activity toward CHO cells. No early cytotoxic effects were observed with this inhibitor, and its antiproliferative activity appeared to be reversible. Transport studies showed that N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane is actively taken up by the polyamine transport system. Mutant CHO cells defective in polyamine transport were found to be resistant to growth inhibition by this compound. The findings suggest that the antiproliferative effect of N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane is exerted intracellularly through inhibition of hypusine synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1557726768,"Increasing evidence has implicated a post-translational phosphorylation in the production of a catalytically competent protein kinase C. Here we present structural and biochemical evidence that Thr500 of protein kinase C-beta II is the residue phosphorylated by another kinase. Modeling studies indicate that this residue is part of a lip structure at the entrance of the catalytic site; phosphorylation on this lip, or activation loop, is central to the regulation of three kinases whose structures have been elucidated (Taylor, S. S., and Radzio-Andzelm, E. (1994) Structure 2, 345-355). Biochemical data reveal that mutation of Thr500 to an acidic residue (Glu) results in expression of catalytically active protein kinase C in COS cells. In contrast, mutation of this residue to a neutral, non-phosphorylatable residue (Val) results in expression of inactive enzyme. Thus, negative charge at position 500 is required for catalytically competent protein kinase C-beta II. These data suggest that signal processing by protein kinase C cannot occur until the enzyme is first phosphorylated by a protein kinase C kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1569715317,"The genomic DNA for the two Drosophila genes, gstD1 and gstD21, were engineered for expression in Escherichia coli by polymerase chain reaction using a pair of specially designed primers. This newly designed expression system produced consistently high yields of the recombinant glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by S-hexyl-GSH affinity chromatography. Consistent with their differences in size, GST D1 and GST D21 displayed different mobilities on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Circular dichroism spectrometry revealed some differences in the protein secondary structural organization between the two GST D isozymes. Polyclonal antibodies against GST D1 and GST D21 revealed that they are immunologically distinct from each other. The GST D1 antiserum cross-reacted weakly with GST D21, but the GST D21 antiserum had no detectable cross-reactivity with GST D1. The amino acid sequences of GST D1 and GST D21 have 70% identity. GST D1 is active toward CDNB with 17% of the catalytic efficiency of the human alpha GST121, whereas CDNB is a poor substrate for GST D21. Both GST D1 and GST D21 have similar levels of GSH peroxidase activity against cumene hydroperoxide. Another major difference in substrate specificities between GST D1 and GST D21 is in the activity of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) dehydrochlorinase, which exists only in the GST D1 isozyme. This is the first definitive demonstration that DDT dehydrochlorinase activity is an intrinsic property of a Drosophila GST. Our results suggest that GST D1 may play a role in DDT metabolism in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1568784633,"The formation of a fibrillar fibronectin (FN) extracellular matrix requires self-association of FN dimers. In this report, we show that the major sites for self-association are the amino-terminal repeats I1-5 and the first type III repeats. Recombinant FNs and fragments were generated by baculovirus expression of cysteine-rich domains and by bacterial expression of type III repeats as fusion proteins with maltose binding protein. When recombinant polypeptides were immobilized on microtiter wells, FN bound to 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment and to fusion proteins containing repeats III1-2 and III1-6 but not to other type III repeats. Similar results were obtained with a gel overlay assay. Binding was concentration-dependent and saturable. The amino-terminal binding site for III1-2 was further localized to repeats I1-5. Therefore, at least two different sites for FN-FN interaction reside near the amino terminus of the molecule. A model for the regulation of FN matrix assembly is proposed based on intramolecular interactions between these amino-terminal sites."
https://openalex.org/W1645568321,"One feature that distinguishes all of the inhibitory members of the serpin gene family is the presence of a small uncharged residue at the P14 position of the reactive center loop. In this report we examine the effects of mutations at this position, in the serpin, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). Replacement of the native P14 Thr-333 residue by an Arg (Thr-333-->Arg) resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity toward tissue-type plasminogen activator and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Comparison of the binding of the mutant inhibitor and wild type PAI-1 (WTPAI-1) to anhydrotrypsin indicated that the initial interaction of the two inhibitors with proteases was identical. However, whereas WTPAI-1 forms SDS-stable complexes with both plasminogen activators, the mutant PAI-1 was efficiently cleaved as a substrate. Amino-terminal sequence analysis indicated that cleavage of the mutant PAI-1 occurred at its reactive center P1-P1' Arg-Met bond. Thermal denaturation studies of native and cleaved PAIs indicated that native Thr-333-->Arg mutant had a thermal stability identical to active WTPAI-1 and that both proteins became significantly more stable following cleavage by elastase (cleaved at the P4-P3 bond). Finally, the function of recombinant PAI-1 variants containing 15 of the possible 19 amino acid substitutions at P14 were analyzed. While residue size appeared to have little effect on inhibitory activity, the presence of either a positive or a negative charge at P14, converted PAI-1 to a substrate. Taken together, these results suggest that while insertion of the reactive center loop is not essential for protease binding, it is a necessary second step required for inhibitor function. The presence of a charged residue at P14 can retard this insertion, resulting in conversion of the serpin to a substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1589191932,"A rise in extracellular calcium (Ca2+e) suppresses not only secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) but also expression of the PTH gene to ensure constant plasma Ca2+ level. A nuclear protein(s) in a wide variety of cells bound to the specific DNA elements (negative Ca2+ responsive elements, nCaREs) in the human PTH gene in sequence-specific and Ca2+e concentration-dependent manners. Our Southwestern cloning revealed that a redox factor protein (ref1), which was known to activate several transcription factors via alterations of their redox state, belonged to an nCaRE binding protein. The level of ref1 mRNA as well as of its protein was elevated by an increase in Ca2+e concentration. In gel shift assay, anti-ref1 antibody eliminated formation of the nCaRE-protein complex. We also found that there was another protein(s) interacting with nCaREs and ref1. Further, experiments with an antisense-ref cDNA expression vector introduced into cultured cells suggested that DNA (nCaRE)-ref1 interaction led to Ca2+e-mediated transcriptional suppression. Thus, it is concluded that ref1 possesses transcription repressor activity in addition to its function as a transcriptional auxiliary protein."
https://openalex.org/W1507225552,"GRK6, a 66-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase, is a recently identified member of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family. GRKs are involved in the phosphorylation of seven-transmembrane receptors, a process mediating desensitization of signal transduction. An important feature of these enzymes is their membrane-associated nature, which for some members is stimulus-dependent. The structural basis for this membrane association previously has been shown in different members of the GRK family to include isoprenylation, G protein beta gamma-binding domains, and basic regions to provide electrostatic interactions with phospholipids. We provide evidence that another mechanism includes fatty acid acylation. GRK6, but not other GRKs tested, incorporated tritium after incubation with [3H]palmitate in Sf9 and in COS-7 cells overexpressing the kinase. The incorporated radioactivity was released from the protein by neutral hydroxylamine, indicating the presence of a thioester bond, and was confirmed as palmitic acid by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis defined the region of palmitate attachment as a cluster of 3 cysteines (Cys561, Cys562, and Cys565) in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the kinase, consistent with the location of the membrane targeting domains of GRKs 1, 2, 3, and 5. Palmitoylation of GRK6 appears essential for membrane association, since palmitoylated kinase was found only in the membrane fraction. This lipid modification provides a structural basis for potential regulation of the subcellular distribution of GRK6 through acylation/deacylation cycles."
https://openalex.org/W1580210275,"The transcription and mRNA levels of murine liver stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) are induced 11- and 45-fold, respectively, by feeding fasted normal mice with a fat-free, high carbohydrate diet (Ntambi, J. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10925-10930). In this study, we used streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice to study the regulatory role of carbohydrate and insulin on expression of the SCD1 gene in liver. Fructose administration to fasted diabetic mice induced a 2-fold increase in SCD1 mRNA within 6 h and a 23-fold increase within 24 h. Similarly, insulin administration to diabetic mice induced SCD1 mRNA from 4-fold within 4 h to 22-fold within 24 h. Insulin plus fructose, however, achieved full induction, with a 45-fold increase of SCD1 mRNA and a 10-fold increase in SCD1 transcription within 24 h. Additionally, the effect of insulin on SCD1 mRNA was inhibited 75% with dibutyryl-cAMP and theophylline administration and 70% by cycloheximide administration. Synthesis of liver albumin mRNA showed little change upon dietary manipulation or insulin treatment. Our data demonstrate that insulin and dietary fructose or a metabolite of fructose positively regulate the expression of the SCD1 gene in mouse liver."
https://openalex.org/W1535912426,"The synthesis of glycogen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is stimulated by nutrient limitation and requires both glycogen synthase and the glycogen branching enzyme. Of the two glycogen synthase genes present in yeast, GSY2 appears to be more important for the accumulation of glycogen upon entry into stationary phase. In cells grown on glucose, GSY2 mRNA levels increased approximately 10-fold during the transition from logarithmic to stationary phase. Growth of cells in glycerol, however, resulted in constitutive expression of GSY2 mRNA and the corresponding protein, GS-2, suggestive of glucose repression of GSY2. Mutants defective in the SNF1 gene, which encodes a protein kinase important in glucose repression mechanisms, are known not to accumulate glycogen. A modest 2-4-fold decrease in total GS-2 level was observed, and upon entry into stationary phase, the enzyme was blocked in the inactive, phosphorylated state in snf1 strains. The GS-2 protein is thought to be regulated by covalent phosphorylation of three COOH-terminal sites (Hardy, T.A., and Roach, P.J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 23799-23805), removal of which results in constitutively active glycogen synthase that bypasses phosphorylation controls. Expression of COOH-terminally truncated GS-2 in snf1 cells restored glycogen accumulation, and so we propose that the SNF1 kinase controls the phosphorylation state of GS-2. Cyclic AMP pathways also exert control over glycogen accumulation. In bcy1 cells, which have constitutively active cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, greatly reduced levels of both GS-2 message and protein were observed. With wild type GSY2 placed under control of the ADH1 promoter, bcy1 cells did not accumulate glycogen despite increased GS-2. Overexpression of truncated GS-2, however, resulted in definite though reduced glycogen accumulation; the glycogen synthesized was structurally distinct from wild type with properties characteristic of less branched polysaccharide. We conclude that the cAMP pathway controls both the expression and the phosphorylation state of GS-2. Furthermore, other factor(s) necessary for glycogen biosynthesis, such as the branching enzyme GLC3, must also be under negative control by the cAMP pathway. The results demonstrate interactive controls of GS-2 by the cAMP-dependent and SNF1 protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1501307447,"The recombinant human Vaccinia virus H1-related protein tyrosine phosphatase, (VHR PTPase) possesses intrinsic Tyr and Thr/Ser phosphatase activities. Both activities were abolished by a single amino acid substitution, C124S. When VHR was incubated with a 32P-labeled phosphotyrosine-containing substrate and then rapidly denatured, enzyme-associated 32P was evident following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The formation of 32P-labeled protein could be blocked in the presence of an unlabeled substrate. VHR-associated 32P was sensitive to iodine but insensitive to pyridine and hydroxylamine. The catalytically inactive C124S mutant would not form a 32P-labeled enzyme. Furthermore, VHR phosphatase could be selectively inactivated by the alkylating agent iodoacetate. The inactivation resulted from the specific covalent modification of Cys124. Collectively these results suggest that a thiol-phosphate enzyme intermediate is formed when Cys124 of VHR accepts a phosphate from the substrate. Our results also demonstrate that the dual specificity phosphatases and the tyrosine-specific PTPases employ similar catalytic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1580583692,"A benzodiazepine peptidomimetic, BZA-5B, inhibits farnesylation of H-Ras and normalizes the morphology of Rat-1 cells transformed with H-RasV12 at concentrations that do not affect the growth of untransformed Rat-1 cells. In the current experiments, we show that BZA-5B decreases the active forms of enzymes in the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cascade, including Raf, MAP kinase kinase (MEK), and MAP kinase, in cells transformed with H-RasV12. BZA-5B had no effect on these enzymes in cells transformed with H-RasV12,L189, which is geranylgeranylated rather than farnesylated. In cells transformed with H-RasV12, BZA-5B reduced the activities of enzymes in the MAP kinase pathway at concentrations that only partially blocked farnesylation of H-RasV12, suggesting that nonfarnesylated H-RasV12 is a dominant inhibitor of the action of farnesylated H-RasV12 in the BZA-5B treated cells. In untransformed Rat-1 cells, BZA-5B did not inhibit MAP kinase activity nor did it prevent the acute activation triggered by epidermal growth factor, even though farnesylated endogenous H-Ras was no longer detectable. These data raise the possibility that untransformed cells contain a form of Ras (K-Ras or N-Ras) whose prenylation is not inhibited by BZA-5B, thus allowing them to resist the effects of BZA-5B."
https://openalex.org/W1593107231,"The structural basis of receptor-G protein interactions was examined using a photoaffinity derivative of a G protein-activating receptor-derived peptide (Q peptide) from the carboxyl-terminal region of the third intracellular loop of alpha 2 adrenergic receptor. A diazopyruvoyl photoaffinity derivative of this peptide (DAP-Q) was cross-linked to purified bovine brain Go. Specific, competable cross-linking of 750 nM DAP-Q to sites on both the alpha o and beta subunits was observed. No specific cross-linking was seen with non-target proteins or heat-denatured G protein subunits. 125I-DAP-Q labeled the 2-kDa amino-terminal fragment of alpha o as determined by protease digestion of the cross-linked G protein followed by gel electrophoresis or h igh pressure liquid chromatography purification and mass spectroscopy of the radiolabeled proteolysis fragment. The functional significance of incorporation into beta gamma subunit is supported by the absolute requirement of beta gamma subunit for DAP-Q stimulation of Go/Gi GTPase. Thus, specific interactions of G protein-coupled receptors with the beta subunit of G protein, in addition to those with the alpha subunit, appear to be important for receptor-G protein coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1485515194,"The aim of this study was to investigate the process leading to Ca(2+)-activated neutral protease (CANP) activation in vivo. The unautolyzed form of CANP has been targeted to the erythrocyte membrane by increasing, in a controlled way, the Ca2+ concentration in the cells; this was achieved by incubating erythrocytes with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and fixed Ca2+ concentrations. After isolation of the CANP-bearing erythrocyte membrane, we could observe that CANP remained bound to the membrane in the 80-kDa unautolyzed form in the presence of low Ca2+ concentrations (1.75 microM); under these conditions, the preferred CANP substrates (the Ca(2+)-ATPase and Band 3) were cleaved. That the cleavage was due to CANP was shown by the finding that the two substrates were not degraded in the presence of a membrane-permeable irreversible CANP inhibitor, Cbz-Leu-Leu-Tyr-CHN2, nor when the free Ca2+ concentration was decreased to sub microM levels with EDTA. The findings suggest an activation mechanism of CANP based on its translocation to the membrane rather than on its autolysis. In this mechanism, CANP would become reversibly activated on the membrane and would return to the quiescent state after dissociating from it when the cell Ca2+ concentration has returned to the physiological, submicromolar level."
https://openalex.org/W1626156799,"The hormone-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor must be bound to heat shock protein (hsp) 90 for it to have a high-affinity steroid binding conformation. We have recently demonstrated that hsp70 is required for cell-free assembly of the receptor.hsp90 complex and concomitant activation of steroid binding activity (Hutchison, K.A., Dittmar, K.D., Czar, M.J., and Pratt, W. B. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 5043-5049). hsp90 and hsp70 are known to exist together in a cytosolic complex containing several other proteins, and in this work we ask if all of the factors required for proper receptor folding and heterocomplex assembly are preassociated in this multiprotein complex. The multiprotein complex was immunoadsorbed to protein A-agarose from rabbit reticulocyte lysate using the 3G3 monoclonal IgM directed against hsp90. When this immunopellet is mixed with immunadsorbed mouse glucocorticoid receptor and incubated at 30 degrees C with ATP/Mg2+ and KCl, the receptor is converted to the steroid binding conformation. When the immunoadsorbed multiprotein hsp90 complex is washed extensively, it loses a weakly bound protein (not hsp70 or hsp90) that is required for receptor activation. This protein factor is contained in a Centricon C-100 filtrate of lysate which reconstitutes the receptor activating activity of the washed hsp90 complex. The hsp90 complex can be released from the 3G3 antibody, and in the presence of the protein factor in the Centricon C-100 filtrate it converts the receptor into a functional heterocomplex with hsp90. The results support the proposal that the various components of reticulocyte lysate that are required to refold the glucocorticoid receptor to the steroid binding state are preassociated with each other, acting as a self-sufficient protein folding machine."
https://openalex.org/W1483729606,"The asialoglycoprotein receptor is an abundant heterooligomeric endocytic receptor that is predominantly expressed on the sinusoidal surface of the hepatocytes. Proposed physiological and pathophysiological functions ascribed to this hepatic lectin (HL) include the removal of desialylated serum glycoproteins and apoptotic cells, clearance of chylomicron remnants, and a role as a homing receptor for lymphatic and metastatic cells. The assembly of two homologous subunits, HL-1 and HL-2, is required to form functional, high affinity receptors on the cell surface. However, the importance of the individual subunits for receptor transport to the cell surface has been controversial. To explore the significance of the minor HL-2 subunit for receptor expression and function in vivo, we have disrupted the HL-2 gene in mice. Homozygous HL-2-deficient animals are superficially normal. However, HL-1 expression in the liver is greatly reduced, indicating that HL-2 may promote HL-1 stability. Although these mice are completely unable to clear asialoorosomucoid, a high affinity ligand for asialoglycoprotein receptor, they do not accumulate desialylated glycoproteins or lipoproteins in their circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1505792072,"A type II DNA topoisomerase has been purified to homogeneity from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae. The enzyme is composed of two subunits of 60 and 47 kDa. It has a Stokes radius of 69 A and has a sedimentation coefficient of 7.8 S which gives a calculated native molecular mass of approximately 230 kDa, indicating a heterotetrameric structure. This enzyme is ATP and Mg2+ dependent and can relax both negatively and positively supercoiled DNA, but presents no supercoiling activity. The S. shibatae DNA topoisomerase II is more efficient in decatenation than in relaxation. The optimal temperature for the enzymatic activity is approximately 80 degrees C. This archaeal enzyme is not inhibited by the gyrase inhibitor novobiocin but is sensitive to several inhibitors of eucaryotic DNA topoisomerases of type II such as amsacrines, ellipticine, and the quinolone CP-115,953. Like all prokaryotic DNA topoisomerase II, the S. shibatae DNA topoisomerase II is a heterotetramer but the absence of supercoiling activity, the strong decatenase activity, and the pattern of antibiotic sensitivity of the S. shibatae DNA topoisomerase II is reminiscent of eucaryotic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1518086753,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis via phospholipase D (PLD) in several tissues. To determine whether PLD activation is dependent on phosphoinositide hydrolysis by phospholipase C (PLC), we measured the formation of phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut), in TRMP cells overexpressing wild type or various mutant PDGF receptors. Both PLC and PLD were stimulated by PDGF in cells expressing wild type receptors whereas they were not in cells expressing kinase-deficient (R634) receptors. These data indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for activation of both PLC and PLD. Mutation of Tyr-1021 of the PDGF receptor to Phe caused loss of PDGF stimulation of both PLC and PLD. On the other hand, a mutant PDGF receptor that was able to bind PLC gamma 1 but not other signaling proteins (including the Ras GTPase-activating protein, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and a SH2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase (Syp)) restored the stimulatory effect of PDGF on PLC and PLD. Furthermore, receptors in which association with the GTPase-activating protein, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or Syp was individually restored were unable to mediate PDGF stimulation of PLC or PLD. These data indicate that these other signal transduction proteins are not involved in the activation of PLD by PDGF. Treatment of the cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor, Ro-31-8220, and depletion of cellular protein kinase C by pretreatment with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in loss of PLD activation by PDGF indicating a PKC-dependent mechanism. In summary, these results indicate that activation of PLC gamma 1 and protein kinase C are necessary for the stimulation of PLD by PDGF and provide no evidence for alternative mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1538598346,"An RNA polymerase transcription factor IIH holoenzyme (holoTFIIH) has been resolved to near homogeneity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

F., Friedberg, E. C. and Kornberg, R. D. (1993) Cell 75, 1379-1387) and in addition, SSL2 and three further, as yet unidentified, polypeptides. HoloTFIIH possesses C-terminal repeat domain kinase activity and, together with other pure yeast transcription proteins, enables RNA polymerase II transcription in a fully defined system. By contrast, core TFIIH is inert in both C-terminal repeat domain kinase and reconstituted transcription assays."
https://openalex.org/W1485429931,"The in vivo conformational substrates of the GroE chaperonins have been difficult to identify, in part because of limited information on in vivo polypeptide chain folding pathways. Temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) mutants have been characterized for the coat protein and tailspike protein of phage P22. These mutations block intracellular folding at restrictive temperature by increasing the lability of folding intermediates without impairing the stability or function of the native state. Overexpression of GroEL/ES suppressed the defects of tsf mutants at 17 sites in the coat protein, by improving folding efficiency rather than assembly efficiency or protein stability. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that GroEL interacted transiently with newly synthesized wild-type coat protein and that this interaction was prolonged by the tsf mutations. Folding defects of the tailspike polypeptide chains were not suppressed. A fraction of the tsf mutant tailspike chains bound to GroEL but were inefficiently discharged. The results suggest that 1) thermolabile folding intermediates are natural substrates of GroEL/ES; 2) although GroEL may bind such intermediates for many proteins, the chaperoning function is limited to a subset of substrate proteins; and 3) a key reason for the heat-shock response may be to stabilize thermolabile folding intermediates at elevated temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1569135515,"The molecular structure of human liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase complexed with AMP was determined by x-ray diffraction using molecular replacement, starting from the pig kidney enzyme AMP complex. Of the 34 amino acid residues which differ between these two sequences, only one interacts with AMP; Met30 in pig kidney is Leu30 in human liver. From this analysis, six sites in which side chains of amino acid residues are in contact with AMP, Ala24, Leu30, Thr31, Tyr113, Arg140, and Met177, were mutated by polymerase chain reaction. The wild-type and mutant forms were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and their kinetic properties determined. Circular dichroism spectra of the mutants were indistinguishable from that of the wild-type enzyme. Kinetic analyses revealed that all forms had similar turnover numbers, Km values for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and inhibition constants for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Apparent Ki values for AMP inhibition of the Leu30 --> Phe and Met177 --> Ala mutants were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme, but the apparent Ki values for the Arg140 --> Ala and Ala24 --> Phe mutants were 7-to 20-fold higher, respectively. The Thr31 --> Ser mutant exhibited a 5-fold increase in apparent Ki for AMP, while mutation of Thr31 to Ala increased the apparent Ki 120-fold. AMP inhibition of the Tyr113 --> Phe mutant was undetectable even at millimolar AMP concentrations. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate potentiated AMP inhibition of the mutants to the same extent as for the wild-type enzyme, except in the case of the Thr31 --> Ala and Tyr113 --> Phe mutants. Thus, the Met177 --> Ala mutant suggests that the side chain beyond C alpha is not needed for AMP binding, and that the Leu30 --> Phe mutant preserves the AMP contacts with these side chains. Thr31, Tyr113, and Arg140 form key hydrogen bonds to AMP consistent with strong side chain interactions in the wild-type enzyme. Finally, the absence of any effect of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate on AMP inhibition observed in the Thr31 --> Ala mutant may be an important clue relating to the mechanism of synergism of these two inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1590138737,"We have overproduced, partially purified, and characterized PrtD, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) integral membrane component from the metalloproteases secretion system of the Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi. These metalloproteases are secreted independently of the general export pathway encoded by the sec genes. They are secreted via a C-terminal secretion signal and by a secretion apparatus composed of two inner membrane proteins, PrtD and PrtE, and one outer membrane protein PrtF. PrtD is specifically labeled by 8-azido-ATP both in whole membrane vesicles and upon purification. The purified protein displays a low level of P-type ATPase activity. This activity is almost completely and specifically inhibited by the cognate C-terminal secretion signal of the PrtG and PrtB metalloproteases (half inhibition at 0.1 microM) but not by a C-terminal secretion signal of a protein not secreted by the Prt translocator. A mutant PrtD protein bearing a point mutation in the ATP binding site (conserved lysine 370 of the Walker A box changed to arginine) has also been purified. It displays a lower level of ATPase activity which correlates with the lower level of secretion of the metalloproteases by a strain expressing this mutated protein."
https://openalex.org/W1544179526,"Limited proteolysis and site-directed mutagenesis of human nerve growth factor (hNGF) was utilized to determine the role of the NH2 terminus in p140TrkA (TrkA) receptor function. Purified (6-118)hNGF, representing deletion of the first 5 NH2-terminal residues, is 9-fold less potent than (1-118)hNGF in displacing 125I-hNGF from TrkA. The deletion of a further 4 residues to form (10-118)hNGF is nearly 300-fold less potent. (6-118)hNGF is only 2-4-fold less potent than (1-118)hNGF in eliciting TrkA autophosphorylation and PC12 cell neurite outgrowth, suggesting that the first 5 residues of the NH2 terminus are necessary for full TrkA binding activity but may be less critical for potent receptor activation and intracellular signaling. In contrast, purified mutant H4D results in a nearly 1000-fold loss in TrkA binding at 4 degrees C relative to (1-118)hNGF, at least 10-fold less potency of TrkA autophosphorylation, and 30-fold loss of potency in PC12 cell differentiation. NH2-terminal hBDNF/hNGF and hNT3/hNGF chimeric mutants further affected these activities suggesting that the NH2-terminal sequence specificity of hNGF contributes to structural interactions necessary for TrkA receptor binding and ligand-induced signaling. The potency of binding of all hNGF variants to the low affinity NGF receptor p75 was largely unaffected indicating distinct structural contributions of the NH2-terminal region of hNGF to the binding to TrkA versus p75."
https://openalex.org/W1603322339,"Glucose stimulation of pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion is closely coupled to alterations in ion channel conductances and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). To further examine this relationship after augmentation of voltage-dependent K+ channel expression, transgenic mice were produced which specifically overexpress a human insulinoma-derived, tetraethylammonium (TEA)-insensitive delayed rectifier K+ channel in their pancreatic beta-cells as shown by immunoblot of isolated islets and immunohistochemical analysis of pancreas sections. Whole-cell current recordings confirmed the presence of high amplitude TEA-resistant K+ currents in transgenic islet cells, whose expression correlated with hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia. Stable overexpression of the channel in insulinoma cells attenuated glucose-activated increases in [Ca2+]i and prevented the induction of TEA-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations. These results, employing the first ion channel transgenic mouse, demonstrate the importance of membrane potential regulation in excitation-secretion coupling in the pancreatic beta-cell."
https://openalex.org/W1502480664,"PG-M is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that has been shown to be expressed in the prechondrogenic condensation area of the developing chick limb buds. We previously isolated cDNA clones encoding the core protein of PG-M (Shinomura, T., Nishida, Y., Ito, K., and Kimata, K. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14461-14469). The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA analysis revealed the presence of two epidermal growth factor-like domains, a C-type lectin-like domain, and a complement regulatory protein (CRP)-like domain at the COOH terminus. The COOH-terminal portion has been expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli to test its carbohydrate binding activity using affinity chromatography. The purified fusion protein binds to immobilized D-mannose, D-galactose, L-fucose, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in a calcium-dependent manner. Furthermore, the fusion protein binds to heparin- or heparan sulfate-Sepharose. To investigate roles of each COOH-terminal domain, we have made a truncated construct which lacks the CRP-like domain and determined if the CRP-like domain is involved in the binding activity. The removal of this domain resulted in the complete loss of both C-type lectin-like and heparin binding activities. The results suggest that a whole set of epidermal growth factor-, lectin-, and CRP-like domains may serve a functional structure for these bindings."
https://openalex.org/W1590772972,"Human beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), the transmembrane precursor of the Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid peptide, was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by fusion to prepro-alpha-factor. From analysis of protease-deficient yeast strains, the fusion protein underwent partial processing by Kex2 protease to generate full-length APP and a fraction of the molecules were degraded in the vacuole. A soluble APP ectodomain fragment bearing lumenal but not cytosolic epitopes was released into the media, indicating cleavage by a membrane protein-solubilizing proteinase or activity. Yeast cells contained a C-terminal APP fragment that co-migrated with authentic C-terminal fragment derived from alpha-secretase cleavage of full-length APP in human cells. The N-terminal sequence of immunoaffinity purified C-terminal APP fragment from yeast was identical to that reported in mammalian and insect cells. These results demonstrate the existence of a secretase activity in yeast. Furthermore, this yeast secretase activity may be related to an APP processing activity present in metazoan cells."
https://openalex.org/W1599279594,"Eosinophil production of superoxide (O2-.) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is important in host defense. The present study assessed the potential of eosinophils to generate another potent cytotoxic species, the hydroxyl radical (.OH). .OH formation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated eosinophils was demonstrated using an alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butyl nitrone/ethanol spin trapping system. Additionally, .OH was spin trapped following the addition of purified eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) to a cell-free O2-./H2O2 generating systems. Effects of superoxide dismutase, catalase, azide, aminotriazole, chloride-depleted buffer, and extensive metal chelation were consistent with .OH formation via the reaction of O2-. and EPO-generated hypohalous acid. Under chloride-depleted conditions, physiologic concentrations of Br- increased .OH formation by both PMA-stimulated eosinophils and the cell-free EPO system. Physiologic concentrations of SCN-, however, did not increase .OH formation, and in the presence of both Br- and SCN-, .OH formation was similar to SCN- only. Eosinophils appear to form .OH via an EPO-dependent mechanism, the magnitude of which varies with the availability of various EPO substrates. Given the highly reactive nature of this radical and the ability of EPO to adhere to cell membranes, even small amounts of .OH formed at such sites could contribute to eosinophil-mediated cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2106238336,"Three neurotrophic factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and nerve growth factor (NGF) form noncovalent homodimers in solution. Since they are highly homologous proteins, it seemed probable that two monomers of these proteins might associate together to form a heterodimer. This was tested by denaturing the two different proteins together in 6 M guanidine HCl and refolding them in phosphate-buffered saline. When the refolded mixture of BDNF and NT-3 was subjected to Mono S cation exchange chromatography, a new peak was observed eluting between NT-3 and BDNF, which accounted for about 30% of the protein used. This new protein species migrated as a single band upon native gel electrophoresis with mobility between that of the NT-3 homodimer and the BDNF homodimer, indicating that a complex had been formed. Sedimentation equilibrium data show that the dissociation constant of this heterodimer is < 3 x 10(-10) M. The heterodimer was stable upon incubation at 37 degrees C in phosphate-buffered saline over 11 days. Having determined that the heterodimer is highly stable, it was subjected to various biological assays. Autophosphorylation assay using TrkB receptor showed that the heterodimer is indistinguishable from the BDNF or NT-3 homodimer in the ability to induce phosphorylation of the receptor. It was also indistinguishable from the homodimers in the neurotrophic activity using chick dorsal root ganglion explant. In the sympathetic neuron survival assay, the heterodimer behaved more similarly to NT-3, whereas in the dopamine uptake assay, it was intermediate between the two homodimers. In addition, the heterodimer was shown to be retrogradely transported in the dorsal root ganglion neurons. A heterodimer between NGF and BDNF is formed but much less effectively than the NT-3.BDNF heterodimer, and it is not stable even at 4 degrees C. These results indicate that BDNF and NT-3 have an intersubunit contact surface for dimerization resembling each other's but different from the contact surface of NGF."
https://openalex.org/W1602221728,"A key protein involved in the regulated exocytotic mechanism in neuroendocrine cells is the GTP-binding protein, Rab3A. Rab3A is thought to mediate exocytosis by an interaction of its effector domain with a putative effector protein. We demonstrate here that Rab3A effector domain peptides specifically stimulated insulin exocytosis in electroporated insulin-secreting cells (K0.5 activation, 6-8 microM) in a Ca(2+)-independent manner, although in the presence of Ca2+ insulin exocytosis was further potentiated. By using a 125I-radiolabeled photoactivated cross-linking Rab3A effector domain peptide, we identified a cytosolic protein doublet (REEP-1 and REEP-2), which specifically interacted with the Rab3A effector domain. Competitive inhibition studies revealed this protein-protein interaction to be at a concentration equivalent to that required for Rab3A effector domain peptides to trigger insulin exocytosis (Ki, 6-8 microM). Furthermore, under basal secretory conditions REEP-1 and -2 were membrane-associated, but upon stimulation of exocytosis they were released into a cytosolic fraction. Our results suggest that REEP-1 and -2 are part of the regulated exocytotic machinery, and their dissociation upon stimulation of hormone release (likely from a protein complex) may be essential to the mechanism that triggers regulated exocytosis in pancreatic beta-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1524849287,"Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) serves as the major immediate substrate of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptors and following tyrosine phosphorylation binds to specific Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and GRB2, a molecule believed to link IRS-1 to the Ras pathway. To investigate how these SH2-containing signaling molecules interact to regulate insulin/IGF-1 action, IRS-1, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SH2 domain fusion proteins and Ras proteins were microinjected into Xenopus oocytes. We found that pleiotropic insulin actions are mediated by IRS-1 through two independent, but convergent, pathways involving PI 3-kinase and GRB2. Thus, microinjection of GST-fusion proteins of either p85 or GRB2 inhibited IRS-1-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) and S6 kinases and oocyte maturation, although only the GST-SH2 of p85 reduced insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activation. Co-injection of a dominant negative Ras (S17N) with IRS-1 inhibited insulin-stimulated MAP and S6 kinase activation. Micro-injection of activated [Arg12,Thr59]Ras increased basal MAP and S6 kinase activities and sensitized the oocytes to insulin-stimulated maturation without altering insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase. The Ras-enhanced oocyte maturation response, but not the elevated basal level of MAP and S6 kinase, was partially blocked by the SH2-p85, but not SH2-GRB2. These data strongly suggest that IRS-1 can mediate many of insulin's actions on cellular enzyme activation and cell cycle progression requires binding and activation of multiple different SH2-domain proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1567873484,"F9 teratocarcinoma is a useful model for studying early embryogenesis since these cells can differentiate into primitive or parietal endoderm under the influence of retinoic acid or retinoic acid and cyclic AMP, respectively. We have found that three isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC alpha, -beta, and -gamma) were expressed in undifferentiated stem cells. When the cells were treated with retinoic acid either alone or in the presence of cAMP for 120 h, PKC alpha mRNA and protein levels increased, whereas those of PKC beta and PKC gamma became undetectable. These changes began within 24 h of drug treatment and were complete by 48-72 h. In order to determine the functional significance of the induction of PKC alpha during F9 differentiation, we established two stable transfectants that overexpressed PKC alpha protein between 4- and 5-fold compared to wild type cells. Characterization of these cell lines revealed an altered pattern of expression of some of the markers of F9 differentiation. The clone that had the highest amount of PKC alpha protein constitutively expressed mRNA for type IV collagen and c-Jun, which are not normally expressed until 24-48 h of treatment with differentiation agents. In the other overexpressing clone, these markers were induced much faster than in wild type cells. The growth rate of both overexpressing clones was less than wild type cells, while the expression of the PKC beta protein in these clones was similar to the levels found in differentiated F9 cells. However, other markers of differentiation, including the cellular morphology and levels of pST6-135 and c-myc RNA, responded to agents identically in both wild type and PKC-alpha-overexpressing clones. Therefore, overexpression of PKC alpha is not sufficient to induce full differentiation of F9 cells. However, our data suggest that certain pathways that lead to the expression of differentiation-dependent genes are regulated by PKC alpha protein levels."
https://openalex.org/W1515246706,"During nitrogenase catalysis the Fe protein and the MoFe protein associate and dissociate in a MgATP-dependent process involving electron transfer from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein. A docking model, based primarily on the crystal structures of the separate components from Azotobacter vinelandii, was previously proposed in which the 2-fold symmetric surface of the homodimeric Fe protein interacts with the exposed surface of a MoFe protein pseudosymmetric alpha beta-unit interface. In this model, a loop, which is included within residues 59 through 67 of the Fe protein primary sequence, is likely to interact with the MoFe protein during component protein docking. In the present study, evidence supporting the component protein docking model was obtained by construction of an A. vinelandii strain that produces a hybrid Fe protein for which residues 59 through 67 have been replaced by the corresponding residues from the Fe protein of Clostridium pasteurianum. Biochemical analyses of the hybrid Fe protein revealed the following features when compared with the unaltered Fe protein. First, the hybrid Fe protein exhibited half the maximum specific activity of the normal Fe protein and was insensitive to inhibition by low levels of NaCl. Second, the hybrid Fe protein activity was hypersensitive to a molar excess of MoFe protein, which also resulted in the uncoupling of MgATP hydrolysis from substrate reduction. Third, stopped-flow spectrophotometry experiments showed that during catalysis the hybrid Fe protein dissociates from the MoFe protein at only half the normal rate of Fe protein-MoFe protein dissociation. Thus, the salient feature of the hybrid Fe protein is that it appears to form a relatively tighter complex with the MoFe protein. This property is in line with previous biochemical reconstitution experiments where it was shown that a heterologous mixture of Fe protein from C. pasteurianum and MoFe protein from A. vinelandii form a tight, inactive complex and supports the proposal that a region defined by residues 59 through 67 within the Fe protein is involved in component protein interaction."

We report here that the human gene for the catalytically important alpha subunit is more than 69 kilobase pairs and consists of 16 exons. The exons that encode solely protein sequences vary from 54 to 240 base pairs (bp), and the introns vary from 750 to more than 16,000 bp. The 133 bp of 5'-untranslated sequences of the mRNA are coded by two exons, and these sequences contain inverted repeats with a potential for stem-loop formation, which may be involved in translational control of the expression of this gene. The 5'-flanking region contains a TATa motif at -29 relative to the major transcription site but no CCAAT motif. The 5'-flanking region and the downstream sequences contain several motifs that may act as binding sites for various transcription factors. Evidence has previously been reported for a mutually exclusive alternative splicing of RNA transcripts of this gene. The present data indicate that the mutually exclusive sequences found in the mRNAs are coded by two consecutive, homologous 71-bp exons 9 and 10. These exons are identical in their first 5 bp and the overall identity between them is 61% at the nucleotide level and 58% at the level of the coded amino acids. Both types of mRNA were found to be expressed in all of the tissues studied, but in some tissues the type coding for exon 9 or 10 sequences was more abundant than the other type."

A TGF-beta 1 mutant with Cys77 replaced by serine has been expressed in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified to homogeneity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirms that the sole interchain disulfide bond in TGF-beta 1 has been eliminated. It is 20% as potent as native TGF-beta 1 in the induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter expression in mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu), although it is less than 1% as potent as native TGF-beta 1 in inhibition of growth in the same cell line. The mutant acts as a full agonist in both bioassays. [Ser77]TGF-beta 1 binds to soluble type II receptors and competes with native TGF-beta 1 in sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; however, in Mv1Lu cells, the mutant shows preferential cross-linking to type I rather than type II receptors. [Ser77]TGF-beta 1 is a useful tool for understanding the different ligand-receptor complexes and numerous biological activities of this multifunctional cytokine."
https://openalex.org/W1542079437,"M-TAT is a cytokine-dependent cell line with the potential to differentiate along the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. We cultured M-TAT cells long term (> 1 year) in the continuous presence of erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or stem cell factor (SCF). These long term cultures are referred to as M-TAT/EPO, M-TAT/GM-CSF, and M-TAT/SCF cells, respectively. Hemoglobin concentration and gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA levels were significantly higher in M-TAT/EPO cells than in M-TAT/GM-CSF cells. When the supplemented cytokine was switched from GM-CSF to EPO, hemoglobin synthesis in M-TAT/GM-CSF cells increased rapidly (within 5 h), and the level of GATA-1 mRNA increased. In contrast, the addition of GM-CSF to the M-TAT/EPO cell culture decreased the amount of hemoglobin, even in the presence of EPO, indicating that the EPO signal for erythroid differentiation is suppressed by GM-CSF. Thus, erythroid development of M-TAT cells is promoted by EPO and suppressed by GM-CSF. These results support the hypothesis that EPO actively influences the programming of gene expression required for erythroid progenitor cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1592114118,"We have previously purified to homogeneity from rat liver plasma membranes a 90-kDa glycoprotein with S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione-stimulated ATPase activity and other properties which identify it as the multispecific organic anion transporter (MOAT) specific for the transport into bile of non-bile acid organic anions (Pikula, S., Hayden, J. B., Awasthi, S., Awasthi, Y. C., and Zimniak, P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 27566-27573). In the present communication, we report the functional reconstitution of this protein into artificial proteoliposomes. The reconstituted protein catalyzed time- and concentration-dependent uptake of S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione into the vesicles. The transport required the presence of ATP. Phosphorylation of the 90-kDa protein by protein kinase C prior to reconstitution more than tripled the Vmax of transport but did not change the Km for S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione. The protein created and, at steady state, maintained a more than 200-fold and 500-fold S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione gradient across the membrane for the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated form, respectively. The transport activity of the 90-kDa protein is sufficient to account for the hepatic secretory maximum of non-bile acid organic anions in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W1503709228,"To investigate the highly denatured state of ovalbumin (molecular mass of 42.7 kDa, four cysteine sulfhydryls and one cystine disulfide) using the disulfide rearrangement approach, we established the peptide-mapping procedure using a cysteine-labeling technique with a fluorescent dye that allows the quantitative analyses for the disulfide-involved half-cystines. Ovalbumin denatured at a low protein concentration in 8-10 M urea, in which the protein showed complete unfolding as evaluated by far-UV CD spectra, was analyzed for the disulfide-involved half-cystines using the peptide-mapping procedure. Data clearly showed that the number of free sulfhydryls and intrachain disulfides were four and one, respectively, but that all six half-cystines are labeled with the dye. These results strongly suggested that 15 disulfide isomers that are theoretically possible for a molecule having one disulfide and four sulfhydryls are all generated during the denaturation. The quantitative data for the ratios of the observed labeling values for the six half-cystines, relative to the overall labeling values, were consistent with the view that the distribution of the 15 possible disulfide isomers at equilibrium depends on the number of amino acid residues separating the two half-cystines to the power of -1.9 to -2.0. Essentially, the same non-gaussian chain nature was also observed with kinetic data for sulfhydryl-disulfide exchanges after denaturation of native ovalbumin."
https://openalex.org/W1509372357,"Oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) may be a critical atherogenic event owing to the diverse array of biologic effects attributed to modified LDL. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that the lipophilic nitrone spin trap alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) can inhibit Cu(2+)-dependent LDL oxidation while the related, more hydrophilic analog alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butyl nitrone is ineffective. Because the inhibitory activity of PBN is relatively weak as compared to hydrophobic phenolic antioxidants, we have synthesized a number of cyclic analogues of PBN that encompass a wide range of hydrophobicity and examined their ability to inhibit LDL oxidation in vitro. Formation of a six-membered ring by a bond formed from one methyl of the tert-butyl group to the aromatic ring yielded MDL 101,002, which was 3- and 24-fold more active than PBN against Cu2+ and 2,2'-azobis-2-amidinopropane hydrochloride-dependent oxidation, respectively. The effect of aromatic substituents was examined and, in general, activity positively correlated with hydrophobicity, particularly with Cu2+. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy demonstrated that the PBN adduct in oxidized LDL is composed of a mobile component (exposed to the LDL aqueous phase) and an immobilized component, localized in the lipid-protein interface or in the bulk lipid. The most active cyclic nitrones exhibited only highly immobilized adducts, suggesting they are buried within the particle. Studies with MDL 105,185 (which is a chloro-substituted nitrone containing a seven-membered ring rather than six-membered as for MDL 101,002) demonstrated radical trapping in both the lipid and apoprotein fractions. Compounds in which a spirocyclohexyl ring was substituted for the gem-dimethyl methylene (MDL 102,832 and 101,694) formed hydrophobic Cu2+ complexes that were observed in the lipid fraction by ESR. This result was confirmed by fractionation of LDL oxidation reaction mixtures and spectrophotometric quantitation of associated Cu2+. The ability to bind Cu2+ was dependent upon the presence of the spirocyclohexyl ring. These data demonstrate that cyclic nitrones can inhibit LDL oxidation at exceedingly low concentrations by multiple mechanisms: 1) trapping of lipid-derived radicals, 2) trapping of apoprotein B-derived radicals, and 3) binding of Cu2+ ions. It is suggested that this new class of highly potent spin traps may be used as effective radical traps in free radical biology and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1584795488,"Pulmonary surfactant protein C (SP-C) gene expression is developmentally and hormonally regulated in fetal lung. In the present study, we investigated the role of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms in the developmental, cAMP, and dexamethasone induction of SP-C mRNA. We found that developmental induction of SP-C mRNA was not coincident with induction of SP-C gene transcription. SP-C mRNA levels reached approximately 90% of levels in adult lung on day 24 of gestation, whereas SP-C gene transcription was only approximately 4% of level in adult lung and did not increase until day 28 of gestation (term in rabbit = 31 days). Treatment of fetal lung tissues in vitro with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) and dexamethasone increased SP-C mRNA accumulation by different mechanisms. Increase in SP-C mRNA accumulation by Bt2cAMP was the result of increased SP-C gene transcription, whereas increased SP-C mRNA accumulation by dexamethasone was due to stabilization of RNA. In control tissues the SP-C mRNA half-life (t1/2) was 11.2 h, and after dexamethasone treatment it increased to 30 h. These data show that both transcriptional and mRNA stabilization mechanisms regulate induction of SP-C gene expression during fetal lung development and by cAMP and dexamethasone in fetal lung in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1505360216,"Rhodanese is a small (33 kDa) monomeric sulfurtransferase which is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes and imported into the mitochondrial matrix without cleavage of its amino terminus. When we transfected mammalian cell lines with rhodanese cDNA under the control of an efficient viral promoter, up to 40% of the overexpressed protein was secreted into the medium. This secretion was not the result of cell lysis, did not occur via the endoplasmic reticulum, and did not require the amino-terminal mitochondrial import signal. Addition of a carboxyl-terminal peptide extension did not block secretion, nor did a number of inhibitors of cellular sorting processes. Rhodanese polypeptide is known to associate with chaperonin proteins. In the absence of available mitochondrial import sites, such a complex in the cytoplasm of transfected cells could deliver unfolded rhodanese to export pores on the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This mechanism could contribute to the nonclassical secretion of cytoplasmically synthesized interleukins, growth factors, and lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1589902814,"We have devised a method for obtaining highly enriched membranes of a late yeast Golgi compartment, operationally defined by their containing the Kex2p protease, and generated four hybridoma cell lines that produced monoclonal antibodies directed against distinct Golgi membrane proteins (GMPs) (GMP36, GMP51, GMP77, and GMP95). Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation data indicated that, of the four GMPs analyzed, only GMP51 exhibited essentially an absolute colocalization with Kex2p. Also, as in the case of Kex2p, retention of GMP51 in yeast Golgi membranes was dependent on clathrin function. In contrast, the remaining three GMPs exhibited substantial, but not absolute, colocalization with Kex2p. The collective data are most consistent with a model where GMP36, GMP77, and GMP95 are present in all Kex2p-containing membranes, but Kex2p is present in only a subpopulation of membranes that contain these GMPs, thereby suggesting that either these particular GMPs exhibit overlapping distributions in compartments of the yeast Golgi complex or are also present in non-Golgi compartments. These findings are not consistent with the view that resident yeast Golgi proteins are generally restricted to a specific Golgi subcompartment, but they are consistent with the view that Golgi compartmental identity is determined by the relative mixtures of Golgi proteins that reside within individual cisternae."
https://openalex.org/W1537210328,"Abstract Hemoglobin A (HbA) and two low oxygen affinity variants of HbA, HbPresbyterian and HbYoshizuka, were produced in transgenic pigs and purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography. These two variants contain either lysine (HbPresbyterian) or aspartic acid (HbYoshizuka) instead of the normal asparagine residue at position beta 108 in HbA. Transgenic pigs expressed these variants at a level up to 11% and were healthy. Both HbPresbyterian and HbYoshizuka exhibited low O2 affinity (P50 of 21.2 and 18.9, respectively, compared with control HbA value of 11.8 in 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.5) and retained normal cooperativity with Hill coefficients of 2.9 and 2.5, respectively. HbPresbyterian exhibited Bohr effect comparable with HbA. In contrast, HbYoshizuka had a diminished response to changes in pH. Thus the structural basis of reduced O2 affinity of these variants appears to be distinct: the consequence of mutation at beta 108 is a function of the chemical nature of the side chain. This is further confirmed by the sensitivity of the O2 affinity of the variants to the presence of Cl-. The O2 affinity of HbYoshizuka is insensitive to changes in Cl- concentration, whereas the O2 affinity of HbPresbyterian exhibited a pronounced and dramatic chloride effect. In fact, P50 of HbPresbyterian was identical to that of HbA at very low Cl- concentrations, and the P50 increased to >40 at 0.5 M Cl-. The chloride effect was completely abolished when HbPresbyterian was stabilized at the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate pocket by interdimeric cross-linking. Molecular modeling studies demonstrate that in HbPresbyterian, Cl- can bridge the epsilon-amino group of Lys beta 108 with either the guanidino group of Arg beta 104 or the epsilon-amino group of Lys alpha 99, resulting in the stabilization of the T structure. The utility of these low O2 affinity hemoglobins as cell-free oxygen carriers is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1577955735,"Microsomes isolated from rat liver contain an NADH-dependent lathosterol 5-desaturation system that catalyzes the introduction of a delta 5 bond into lathosterol to form 7-dehydrocholesterol. Microsomes were preloaded in vitro with liposomes composed of lathosterol and phosphatidylcholine in the presence of a high-speed supernatant (S105) protein prior to enzyme assay. The desaturation led to a reaction that occurred in two distinct phases. That is, there was an initial burst of product formation over an approximate time scale of 5 min that fell off, thereafter to a steady state rate for over 30 min. The latter steady state phase was slower than the burst phase, because lateral diffusion of the lathosterol substrate must occur before the next reaction can take place. The total amount of the burst, which may be obtained by extrapolating the linear part of the curve in the steady state phase back to zero time, provides a means of obtaining the enzyme concentration in terms of functional active sites. It was found that the kinetics between enzyme and substrate within the same membrane also followed the usual kinetic formalism of a Michaelis-Menten type reaction as in nonaggregated homogenous solution."
https://openalex.org/W1575910327,"The fourth component of complement (C4) is encoded by two highly homologous genes, C4A and C4B. Only one hemolytically inactive C4A allotype (C4A6) has been reported. No hemolytically inactive C4B allotype has been described. We report the first hemolytically inactive (hi) allotype of C4B, C4B*1 (hi). This unique variant was first recognized by hemolytic overlay assays and confirmed to segregate in the affected pedigree with the major histocompatibility complex haplotype A28,B35,CW4,DR6, C4A3,C4B1(hi), BFF,C2C. By single strand conformational polymorphism, we detected only a migration variant in exon 12 caused by a C to T transition in the second base of codon 459. This mutation results in a leucine substitution for proline (P459L) 1 residue downstream of a residue known to contribute to the C5-binding site. Allele-specific oligonucleotide analysis of samples demonstrated cosegregation of the mutation with the hemolytically inactive allotype in the affected pedigree. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression studies showed that the P459L mutation causes loss of hemolytic function. C4B*1(hi) is the first example of a circulating C4B protein lacking detectable hemolytic activity and the P459L mutation expands our knowledge of the C5-binding site of C4."
https://openalex.org/W2126865255,"5-Ethynyluracil is a time-dependent and tight binding inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. The maximal value of the first-order rate constant for onset of inhibition is 0.01 s-1, and the concentration of 5-ethynyluracil which gives one-half of this value is 190 microM. Because the t1/2 for formation of active enzyme from inhibited enzyme is greater than 30 h in the absence of NADH, inhibition of xanthine oxidase by 5-ethynyluracil is functionally irreversible. One equivalent of 5-[2-14C]ethynyluracil/equivalent of active enzyme is required for complete inhibition. Allopurinol (100 microM), a potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, and cyanide (5 mM), an inactivator of the enzyme, do not abolish the binding of 5-[2-14C]ethynyluracil to the enzyme. Because radiolabel is released from 5-[2-14C]ethynyluracil-treated enzyme by treatment with 6 M guanidine HCl, a stable covalent bond is not formed between the inhibitor and the enzyme. However, the radiolabel released from inhibited enzyme is not 5-ethynyluracil. Moreover, NADH restores catalytic activity to the inhibited enzyme and displaces the radiolabel as 5-acetyluracil. Thermal denaturation of 5-ethynyluracil-inhibited xanthine oxidase results in the release of approximately equal amounts of 5-acetyluracil and a more hydrophilic product. Consequently, the 5-ethynyluracil-xanthine oxidase complex yields different degradation products of 5-ethynyluracil under different denaturation conditions. Seven uracil analogues with 5-substituents were tested as time-dependent inhibitors of xanthine oxidase. 5-Ethynyluracil is the only uracil analogue that potently inhibited xanthine oxidase. The reactivity of these uracil derivatives with sulfite was also determined. 5-Ethynyluracil is many fold more susceptible to nonenzymatic nucleophilic addition of sulfite than are the other analogues. Thus, the potency of these uracil analogues as inhibitors of xanthine oxidase is related to the nonenzymatic reactivity of the analogues with sulfite."
