https://openalex.org/W2735457220,"Controllable, coherent many-body systems can provide insights into the fundamental properties of quantum matter, enable the realization of new quantum phases and could ultimately lead to computational systems that outperform existing computers based on classical approaches. Here we demonstrate a method for creating controlled many-body quantum matter that combines deterministically prepared, reconfigurable arrays of individually trapped cold atoms with strong, coherent interactions enabled by excitation to Rydberg states. We realize a programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable interactions and system sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe phase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase boundary. Our method provides a way of exploring many-body phenomena on a programmable quantum simulator and could enable realizations of new quantum algorithms. Programmable quantum simulations of many-body systems are demonstrated using a reconfigurable array of 51 individually trapped cold atoms with strong, coherent interactions controlled via excitation to Rydberg states. Richard Feynman proposed the quantum computer in 1982 as a technique for simulating states of matter and the various complex interactions that occur within these systems. In the past few years, quantum simulators have become a reality, with several different qubit approaches. For example, small numbers of individually controlled qubits have already been used to simulate molecules and quantum magnets. However, it has remained a challenge to perform tasks that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. In this issue, two papers demonstrate quantum simulators with an unprecedentedly high number of controlled qubits. Mikhail Lukin and colleagues used 51 cold Rydberg atoms and Christopher Monroe and colleagues used 53 trapped ions to study phase transitions in Ising-type quantum magnets. Both groups observed novel many-body interactions that are computationally intractable with classical computers."
https://openalex.org/W2744305830,"Many-body dynamical phases in an Ising-like quantum spin model with long-range interactions are observed by measuring correlations in single shots, using a quantum simulator composed of 53 qubits. Richard Feynman proposed the quantum computer in 1982 as a technique for simulating states of matter and the various complex interactions that occur within these systems. In the past few years, quantum simulators have become a reality, with several different qubit approaches. For example, small numbers of individually controlled qubits have already been used to simulate molecules and quantum magnets.

Mikhail Lukin and colleagues used 51 cold Rydberg atoms and Christopher Monroe and colleagues used 53 trapped ions to study phase transitions in Ising-type quantum magnets. Both groups observed novel many-body interactions that are computationally intractable with classical computers. A quantum simulator is a type of quantum computer that controls the interactions between quantum bits (or qubits) in a way that can be mapped to certain quantum many-body problems1,2. As it becomes possible to exert more control over larger numbers of qubits, such simulators will be able to tackle a wider range of problems, such as materials design and molecular modelling, with the ultimate limit being a universal quantum computer that can solve general classes of hard problems3. Here we use a quantum simulator composed of up to 53 qubits to study non-equilibrium dynamics in the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. We observe a dynamical phase transition after a sudden change of the Hamiltonian, in a regime in which conventional statistical mechanics does not apply4. The qubits are represented by the spins of trapped ions, which can be prepared in various initial pure states. We apply a global long-range Ising interaction with controllable strength and range, and measure each individual qubit with an efficiency of nearly 99 per cent. Such high efficiency means that arbitrary many-body correlations between qubits can be measured in a single shot, enabling the dynamical phase transition to be probed directly and revealing computationally intractable features that rely on the long-range interactions and high connectivity between qubits."
https://openalex.org/W2769795026,"An efficient and direct method of catalytic conversion of methane to liquid methanol and other oxygenates would be of considerable practical value. However, it remains an unsolved problem in catalysis, as typically it involves expensive or corrosive oxidants or reaction media that are not amenable to commercialization. Although methane can be directly converted to methanol using molecular oxygen under mild conditions in the gas phase, the process is either stoichiometric (and therefore requires a water extraction step) or is too slow and low-yielding to be practical. Methane could, in principle, also be transformed through direct oxidative carbonylation to acetic acid, which is commercially obtained through methane steam reforming, methanol synthesis, and subsequent methanol carbonylation on homogeneous catalysts. However, an effective catalyst for the direct carbonylation of methane to acetic acid, which might enable the economical small-scale utilization of natural gas that is currently flared or stranded, has not yet been reported. Here we show that mononuclear rhodium species, anchored on a zeolite or titanium dioxide support suspended in aqueous solution, catalyse the direct conversion of methane to methanol and acetic acid, using oxygen and carbon monoxide under mild conditions. We find that the two products form through independent pathways, which allows us to tune the conversion: three-hour-long batch-reactor tests conducted at 150 degrees Celsius, using either the zeolite-supported or the titanium-dioxide-supported catalyst, yield around 22,000 micromoles of acetic acid per gram of catalyst, or around 230 micromoles of methanol per gram of catalyst, respectively, with selectivities of 60-100 per cent. We anticipate that these unusually high activities, despite still being too low for commercial application, may guide the development of optimized catalysts and practical processes for the direct conversion of methane to methanol, acetic acid and other useful chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W2768867213,"Since at least the last common ancestor of all life on Earth, genetic information has been stored in a four-letter alphabet that is propagated and retrieved by the formation of two base pairs. The central goal of synthetic biology is to create new life forms and functions, and the most general route to this goal is the creation of semi-synthetic organisms whose DNA harbours two additional letters that form a third, unnatural base pair. Previous efforts to generate such semi-synthetic organisms culminated in the creation of a strain of Escherichia coli that, by virtue of a nucleoside triphosphate transporter from Phaeodactylum tricornutum, imports the requisite unnatural triphosphates from its medium and then uses them to replicate a plasmid containing the unnatural base pair dNaM-dTPT3. Although the semi-synthetic organism stores increased information when compared to natural organisms, retrieval of the information requires in vivo transcription of the unnatural base pair into mRNA and tRNA, aminoacylation of the tRNA with a non-canonical amino acid, and efficient participation of the unnatural base pair in decoding at the ribosome. Here we report the in vivo transcription of DNA containing dNaM and dTPT3 into mRNAs with two different unnatural codons and tRNAs with cognate unnatural anticodons, and their efficient decoding at the ribosome to direct the site-specific incorporation of natural or non-canonical amino acids into superfolder green fluorescent protein. The results demonstrate that interactions other than hydrogen bonding can contribute to every step of information storage and retrieval. The resulting semi-synthetic organism both encodes and retrieves increased information and should serve as a platform for the creation of new life forms and functions."
https://openalex.org/W2768253137,"The impact of changing climate on terrestrial and underwater archaeological sites, historic buildings, and cultural landscapes can be examined through quantitatively-based analyses encompassing large data samples and broad geographic and temporal scales. The Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA) is a multi-institutional collaboration that allows researchers online access to linked heritage data from multiple sources and data sets. The effects of sea-level rise and concomitant human population relocation is examined using a sample from nine states encompassing much of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the southeastern United States. A 1 m rise in sea-level will result in the loss of over >13,000 recorded historic and prehistoric archaeological sites, as well as over 1000 locations currently eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), encompassing archaeological sites, standing structures, and other cultural properties. These numbers increase substantially with each additional 1 m rise in sea level, with >32,000 archaeological sites and >2400 NRHP properties lost should a 5 m rise occur. Many more unrecorded archaeological and historic sites will also be lost as large areas of the landscape are flooded. The displacement of millions of people due to rising seas will cause additional impacts where these populations resettle. Sea level rise will thus result in the loss of much of the record of human habitation of the coastal margin in the Southeast within the next one to two centuries, and the numbers indicate the magnitude of the impact on the archaeological record globally. Construction of large linked data sets is essential to developing procedures for sampling, triage, and mitigation of these impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2769353100,"The aim of this study was to design a new nanocomposite that would have high cytotoxicity against invasive breast cancer cells and minimum side effects on normal cells.An albumin nano-carrier for delivery of CuNPs was developed. The ACuNPs formation was characterized by TEM, DLS and UV-Vis, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The cytotoxic efficacy of the ACuNPs against human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB 231) and normal cells (MCF-10A) was compared using a standard MTT assay. The mechanism of cell death induced by ACuNPs was considered by inverted and fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry and gel electrophoresis. The effects of compounds on ROS generations in MDA-MB 231 cells were also studied.It was found that the resulted ACuNPs with a diameter of 62.7 nm and zeta potential of about -10.76 mV, are suitable for extravasation into tumor cells. In ACuNPs, the 90% of the secondary structure and almost all the tertiary structure of albumin remained intact. Comparing to CuNPs, ACuNPs could significantly suppress the viability of cancer cells while they were less toxic on normal cells. Compared with the untreated cells, the MDA-MB 231 cell line showed higher levels of ROS production after treatment with ACuNPs. The increase in ROS production after 24 hours indicated that ACuNPs induce apoptosis.The ACuNPs characteristics such as intact structure of albumin, high toxicity against cancer cells comparing to normal cells and apoptosis induction as the mechanism of cell death, revealed that this nanocomposite is a good candidate to be used as a chemotherapeutic agent against invasive breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2769685187,"One of the goals of bone tissue engineering is to mimic native ECM in architecture and function, creating scaffolds with excellent biocompatibility, osteoinductive ability and mechanical properties. The aim of this study was to fabricate nanofibrous matrices by electrospinning a blend of poly (L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), hydroxyapatite (HA), and grapheme oxide (GO) as a favourable platform for bone tissue engineering. The morphology, biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and biological activity of all nanofibrous matrices were compared. The data indicate that the hydrophilicity and protein adsorption rate of the fabricated matrices were significantly increased by blending with a small amount of HA and GO. Furthermore, GO significantly boosted the tensile strength of the nanofibrous matrices, and the PLGA/GO/HA nanofibrous matrices can serve as mechanically stable scaffolds for cell growth. For further test in vitro, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured on the PLGA/HA/GO nanofbrous matrices to observe various cellular activities and cell mineralization. The results indicated that the PLGA/GO/HA nanofibrous matrices significantly enhanced adhesion, and proliferation in MCET3-E1 cells and functionally promoted alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, the osteogenesis-related gene expression and mineral deposition. Therefore, the PLGA/HA/GO composite nanofibres are excellent and versatile scaffolds for applications in bone tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2768670265,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death in young adults. After the initial injury, a poorly understood secondary phase, including a strong inflammatory response determines the final outcome of TBI. The inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB signaling system is the key regulator of inflammation and also critically involved in regulation of neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. We addressed the neuron-specific function of IKK2/NF-κB signaling pathway in TBI using an experimental model of closed-head injury (CHI) in combination with mouse models allowing conditional regulation of IKK/NF-κB signaling in excitatory forebrain neurons. We found that repression of IKK2/NF-κB signaling in neurons increases the acute posttraumatic mortality rate, worsens the neurological outcome, and promotes neuronal cell death by apoptosis, thus resulting in enhanced proinflammatory gene expression. As a potential mechanism, we identified elevated levels of the proapoptotic mediators Bax and Bad and enhanced expression of stress response genes. This phenotype is also observed when neuronal IKK/NF-κB activity is inhibited just before CHI. In contrast, neuron-specific activation of IKK/NF-κB signaling does not alter the TBI outcome. Thus, this study demonstrates that physiological neuronal IKK/NF-κB signaling is necessary and sufficient to protect neurons from trauma consequences.-Mettang, M., Reichel, S.

Mucin-type O-glycosylation is initiated by a large family of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-Ts) that target different proteins and are differentially expressed in cells and organs. Here, we investigated the expression patterns of all of the GalNAc-Ts in colon cancer by analyzing transcriptomic data. We found that GalNAc-T6 was highly up-regulated in colon adenocarcinomas but absent in normal-appearing adjacent colon tissue. These results were verified by immunohistochemistry, suggesting that GalNAc-T6 plays a role in colon carcinogenesis. To investigate the function of GalNAc-T6 in colon cancer, we used precise gene targeting to produce isogenic colon cancer cell lines with a knockout/rescue system for GALNT6. GalNAc-T6 expression was associated with a cancer-like, dysplastic growth pattern, whereas GALNT6 knockout cells showed a more normal differentiation pattern, reduced proliferation, normalized cell–cell adhesion, and formation of crypts in tissue cultures. O-Glycoproteomic analysis of the engineered cell lines identified a small set of GalNAc-T6–specific targets, suggesting that this isoform has unique cellular functions. In support of this notion, the genetically and functionally closely related GalNAc-T3 homolog did not show compensatory functionality for effects observed for GalNAc-T6. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that aberrant GalNAc-T6 expression and site-specific glycosylation is involved in oncogenic transformation.

Although the association between the expression of truncated O-glycans and cancer prognosis per se is well-established, the importance of GalNAc-T-mediated site-specific glycosylation in cancer is unclear, due mainly to technical limitations.

https://openalex.org/W2769443609,"Halogen abundances in chondrites are 6 to 37 times lower than previously reported, which is consistent with the low abundances of these elements found in Earth. The heavy halogens chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br) and iodine (I) are key tracers of accretion during the formation of Earth owing to their high volatility and incompatibility. Patricia Clay and co-authors show that the abundances of these heavy halogens in carbonaceous, enstatite, Rumuruti and ordinary chondrites are much lower than reported previously. The authors also find that the Br/Cl and I/Cl ratios in all the chondrites studied show a limited range, indistinguishable from bulk silicate Earth estimates. This indicates that the depletion of halogens relative to primitive meteorites is consistent with lithophile elements of similar volatility. They conclude that the observed terrestrial halogen inventories cannot be explained by late accretion alone, but also require the efficient extraction of halogen-rich fluids from the solid Earth during the earliest stages of its formation. Volatile element delivery and retention played a fundamental part in Earth’s formation and subsequent chemical differentiation. The heavy halogens—chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br) and iodine (I)—are key tracers of accretionary processes owing to their high volatility and incompatibility, but have low abundances in most geological and planetary materials. However, noble gas proxy isotopes produced during neutron irradiation provide a high-sensitivity tool for the determination of heavy halogen abundances. Using such isotopes, here we show that Cl, Br and I abundances in carbonaceous, enstatite, Rumuruti and primitive ordinary chondrites are about 6 times, 9 times and 15–37 times lower, respectively, than previously reported and usually accepted estimates1. This is independent of the oxidation state or petrological type of the chondrites. The ratios Br/Cl and I/Cl in all studied chondrites show a limited range, indistinguishable from bulk silicate Earth estimates. Our results demonstrate that the halogen depletion of bulk silicate Earth relative to primitive meteorites is consistent with the depletion of lithophile elements of similar volatility. These results for carbonaceous chondrites reveal that late accretion, constrained to a maximum of 0.5 ± 0.2 per cent of Earth’s silicate mass2,3,4,5, cannot solely account for present-day terrestrial halogen inventories6,7. It is estimated that 80–90 per cent of heavy halogens are concentrated in Earth’s surface reservoirs7,8 and have not undergone the extreme early loss observed in atmosphere-forming elements9. Therefore, in addition to late-stage terrestrial accretion of halogens and mantle degassing, which has removed less than half of Earth’s dissolved mantle gases10, the efficient extraction of halogen-rich fluids6 from the solid Earth during the earliest stages of terrestrial differentiation is also required to explain the presence of these heavy halogens at the surface. The hydropilic nature of halogens, whereby they track with water, supports this requirement, and is consistent with volatile-rich or water-rich late-stage terrestrial accretion5,11,12,13,14."
https://openalex.org/W2770397732,"The bioactive, signaling lipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and its analog, fingolimod (FTY720), have previously shown neuroprotective effects against ischemic brain injury. However, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully clarified. The roles of autophagy in ischemic stroke are being increasingly recognized. In the present study, we sought to determine whether the S1P pathway is involved in neuronal autophagy and investigate its possible mechanisms following stroke. Interestingly, we found that FTY720 significantly attenuates infarct volumes and reduces neuronal apoptosis on days 1 and 3 post stroke, accompanied by amelioration of functional deficits. Additionally, FTY720 was found to decrease the induction of autophagosome proteins, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3(LC3-II) and Beclin1, following ischemic stroke in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, protein levels of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the 70-kDa ribosomal protein, S6 kinase1 (p70S6K), were also up-regulated in FTY720-treated animals, and the nonspecific SphK inhibitor, N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), was found to cause a reverse effect. Our results indicate that modulation of the S1P signaling pathway by FTY720 could effectively decrease neuronal autophagy through the mTOR/p70S6K pathway and attenuate ischemic brain injury in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2769483621,"Introduction of and invasion by alien plant pathogens represents the main cause of emerging infectious diseases affecting domesticated and wild plant species worldwide. The trade in living plants is the most common pathway of introduction. Many of the alien tree pathogens recently introduced into Europe were not previously included on any quarantine lists. To help determine the potential risk of pest introduction through trading of ornamental plants, a sentinel nursery was established in Beijing, China in 2008. The sentinel nursery planting included four of the most common ornamental woody species shipped to Europe including Ilex cornuta var. fortunae, Zelkova schneideriana, Fraxinus chinensis and Buxus microphylla. Symptoms developing on these species within the sentinel nursery were detected in 2013 and consisted of necrotic spots on leaves, canker and stem necrosis, shoot blight and shoot necrosis. Fungi associated with the trees and their symptoms included Alternaria alternata detected from all hosts; Diaporthe liquidambaris and Diaporthe capsici from bark and leaf necrosis of Zelkova schneideriana; Botryosphaeria dothidea and Nothophoma quercina from stem cankers on Fraxinus chinensis and leaf necrosis on Ilex cornuta; and Pseudonectria foliicola from leaf necrosis on Buxus microphylla. Next generation sequencing analysis from asymptomatic tissues detected eighteen OTU's at species level among which some taxa had not been previously recorded in Europe. These results clearly demonstrate that looking at trees of internationally traded species in the region of origin can reveal the presence of potentially harmful organisms of major forestry, landscape or crop trees. Results of this study also provide an indication as to how some disease agents can be introduced using pathways other than the co-generic hosts. Hence, sentinel nurseries represent one potential mechanism to address the current lack of knowledge about pests in the countries from where live plants are shipped and the threats they represent to native flora and crops in importing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2783201393,"Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A and X are among the leading causes of bacterial meningitis in the African meningitis belt. Glycoconjugate vaccines, consisting of an antigenic carrier protein coupled to the capsular polysaccharide of the bacterial pathogen, are the most effective strategy for prevention of meningococcal disease. However, the distribution of effective glycoconjugate vaccines in this region is limited by the high cost of cultivating pathogens and purification of their capsular polysaccharides. Moreover, chemical approaches to synthesize oligosaccharide antigens have proven challenging. In the current study, we present a chemoenzymatic approach for generating tailored oligosaccharide fractions ready for activation and coupling to the carrier protein. In a first step, the elongation modes of recombinant capsular polymerases from Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A (CsaB) and X (CsxA) were characterized. We observed that CsaB is a distributive enzyme, and CsxA is a processive enzyme. Sequence comparison of these two stealth family proteins revealed a C-terminal extension in CsxA, which conferred processivity because of the existence of a second product-binding site. Deletion of the C-terminal domain converted CsxA into a distributive enzyme, allowing facile control of product length by adjusting the ratio of donor to acceptor sugars. Solid-phase fixation of the engineered capsular polymerases enabled rapid production of capsular polysaccharides with high yield and purity. In summary, the tools developed here provide critical steps toward reducing the cost of conjugate vaccine production, which will increase access in regions with the greatest need. Our work also facilitates efforts to study the relationship between oligosaccharide size and antigenicity.

Deletion of the C-terminal domain converted CsxA into a distributive enzyme, allowing facile control of product length by adjusting the ratio of donor to acceptor sugars. Solid-phase fixation of the engineered capsular polymerases enabled rapid production of capsular polysaccharides with high yield and purity. In summary, the tools developed here provide critical steps toward reducing the cost of conjugate vaccine production, which will increase access in regions with the greatest need. Our work also facilitates efforts to study the relationship between oligosaccharide size and antigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2768226632,"Pinealocytes regulate circadian rhythm by synthesizing and secreting melatonin. These cells generate action potentials; however, the contribution of specific ion channels to melatonin secretion from pinealocytes remains unclear. In this study, the involvement and molecular identity of Ca2+-activated Cl− (ClCa) channels in the regulation of melatonin secretion were examined in rat pineal glands. Treatment with the ClCa channel blockers, niflumic acid or T16Ainh-A01, significantly reduced melatonin secretion in pineal glands. After pineal K+ currents were totally blocked under whole-cell patch clamp conditions, depolarization and subsequent repolarization induced a slowly activating outward current and a substantial inward tail current, respectively. Both of these current changes were dependent on intracellular Ca2+ concentration and inhibited by niflumic acid and T16Ainh-A01. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and immunocytochemical analyses revealed that TMEM16A and TMEM16B were highly expressed in pineal glands. siRNA knockdown of TMEM16A and/or TMEM16B showed that both channels contribute to ClCa currents in pinealocytes. Conversely, co-expression of TMEM16A and TMEM16B channels or the expression of this tandem channel in HEK293 cells mimicked the electrophysiological characteristics of ClCa currents in pinealocytes. Moreover, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, FRET, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that TMEM16A and TMEM16B can form heteromeric channels, as well as homomeric channels. In conclusion, pineal ClCa channels are composed of TMEM16A and TMEM16B subunits, and these fluxes regulate melatonin secretion in pineal glands."

We report here the expression, purification, and functional characterization of murine IFNϵ (mIFNϵ). Recombinant mIFNϵ (rmIFNϵ) exhibited an α-helical fold characteristic of type I IFNs and bound to IFNα/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFNAR2, but, unusually, it had a preference for IFNAR1. Nevertheless, rmIFNϵ induced typical type I IFN signaling activity, including STAT1 phosphorylation and activation of canonical type I IFN signaling reporters, demonstrating that it uses the JAK–STAT signaling pathway. We also found that rmIFNϵ induces the activation of T, B, and NK cells and exhibits antiviral, antiproliferative, and antibacterial activities typical of type I IFNs, albeit with 100–1000-fold reduced potency compared with rmIFNα1 and rmIFNβ. Surprisingly, although the type I IFNs generally do not display cross-species activities, rmIFNϵ exhibited high antiviral activity on human cells, suppressing HIV replication and inducing the expression of known HIV restriction factors in human lymphocytes. Our findings define the intrinsic properties of murine IFNϵ, indicating that it distinctly interacts with IFNAR and elicits pathogen-suppressing activity with a potency enabling host defense but with limited toxicity, appropriate for a protein expressed constitutively in a sensitive mucosal site, such as the reproductive tract.

https://openalex.org/W2769553018,"Several ion channels and transporters regulate fluid secretion in salivary and lacrimal glands. In salivary glands, the major anion channel involved in fluid secretion is the calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin 1 (ANO1). Several members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel superfamily regulate ANO1 activity. Here, we report a functional interaction between thermosensitive TRP vanilloid (TRPV)4 and ANO1 in acinar cells isolated from mouse salivary and lacrimal glands. TRPV4 activation induced chloride currents and shrinkage of acinar cells by increasing intracellular calcium concentrations. The chloride currents evoked by a TRPV4-specific activator (GSK1016790A) were identified as ANOl-mediated currents. Moreover, TRPV4 activation by an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent mechanism was found to contribute to the muscarinic pathway of fluid secretion. Muscarinic stimulation of saliva and tear secretion was down-regulated in both TRPV4-deficient mice and in acinar cells treated with a TRPV4-specific antagonist (HC-067047). Furthermore, the temperature dependence of muscarinic salivation was shown to depend mainly on TRPV4. Our results suggest that TRPV4 interacts with IP3 receptors and ANO1 to regulate the muscarinic pathway that mediates salivation and lacrimation.— Derouiche, S., Takayama, Y., Murakami, M., Tominaga, M.

https://openalex.org/W2769075163,"To identify reliable biomarkers of age-related changes in chronic inflammation and responsiveness to bacterial and viral challenges, we evaluated endogenous and ex vivo stimulated levels of 18 inflammatory markers, using whole blood collected in EDTA and sodium heparin tubes from 41 healthy volunteers, i.e., 11 men + 10 women aged 20–35 and 10 men + 10 women aged 50–77. These studies revealed significant differences in the levels of inflammatory markers when blood was collected in EDTA versus sodium heparin and age related differences in these biomarkers were confirmed with blood collected in EDTA from 120 healthy volunteers in 3 age categories, ie, 20 men + 20 women, aged 20–35, 36–49 and 50–77. Studies with unstimulated blood samples, to measure levels of chronic inflammation, revealed a significant increase with age in IL-12p70, CRP and PGE2, consistent with the concept of “inflammaging”, and a decrease in G-CSF in both men and women. Interestingly, in response to E. coli stimulation, PGE2 levels were markedly reduced in the 50–77 year old cohort while they were increased following Herpes Simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) stimulation, along with IL-8. In addition, unlike E. coli, HSV-1 potently stimulated IFNα production, but levels were dramatically reduced in the older cohort, consistent with a reduced ability to generate an anti-viral response. We also found platelets and CD8+ T cells were reduced with age while CD4+ T cells were significantly increased, resulting in a substantially higher CD4/CD8 ratio in the older cohort. Surprisingly, however, we found that the older cohort exhibited more T cell proliferation and IFNγ production in response to anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation. Importantly, there was considerable person-to-person variation in these inflammatory markers in all age groups, making possible comparisons between a person’s “inflammage” and chronological age. These assays should help to identify individuals at high risk of autoimmune disorders and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2769387979,"Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials conducted in patients with nondialysis-dependent (NDD) chronic kidney disease (CKD), iron deficiency anemia, and normal or elevated serum phosphorus demonstrated that ferric citrate (FC) significantly increased hemoglobin and decreased serum phosphate concentrations. Pooling these trial results could provide a more robust evaluation of the safety and efficacy of FC in this population. We pooled results of a phase 2 (n = 149) and 3 trial (n = 233) of patients randomized and treated for up to 12 and 16 weeks, respectively. The starting dose in both trials was three 1-g (elemental iron 210 mg) tablets/day with food, up to 12 tablets/day. Doses were titrated in the phase 2 and 3 trials to lower serum phosphate concentrations to a target range (0.97–1.13 mmol/L) and to achieve a ≥10-g/L hemoglobin increase, respectively. Safety was assessed in all patients who received ≥1 dose of FC (n = 190) and placebo (n = 188). Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 143 of 190 (75.3%) FC-treated and 116 of 188 (61.7%) placebo-treated patients; gastrointestinal AEs were the most frequent (94 [49.5%] vs. 52 [27.7%], respectively). Specific events reported in >5% of patients (FC vs. placebo, respectively) included discolored feces (41 [21.6%] vs. 0 [0.0%]), diarrhea (39 [20.5%] vs. 23 [12.2%]), constipation (35 [18.4%] vs. 19 [10.1%]), and nausea (18 [9.5%] vs. 8 [4.3%]). Twenty FC-treated (10.5%) and 21 placebo-treated patients (11.2%) experienced a serious AE. Two patients (1.1%) died in each group. A pooled efficacy assessment demonstrated a consistent hemoglobin rise and modest serum phosphate decline, with few excursions below the normal range. When used for treatment of patients with NDD-CKD, FC contributes to gastrointestinal AEs at higher rates than placebo, while simultaneously correcting two of the principal metabolic manifestations of CKD (iron deficiency anemia and relative hyperphosphatemia)."

In addition, we examined relationships between metabolic status and several fitness parameters: foot health, musculoskeletal health, reproductive cyclicity, and body condition. Two blood samples were collected 2 weeks apart from 87 Asian (Elephas maximus) and 105 African (Loxodonta africana) elephants managed by zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for analysis of serum leptin, insulin, glucose and the glucose-to-insulin ratio (G:I). In females, mean (± SD) leptin concentrations and the G:I were lower (P<0.05) in Asian (3.93 ± 2.21 ng/ml and 110 ± 86 units) compared to African (4.37 ± 2.89 ng/ml and 208 ± 133 units) elephants, respectively. For males, mean leptin and the G:I were 4.99 ± 3.61 ng/ml and 253 ± 181 units for Asian, and 3.72 ± 2.00 ng/ml and 326 ± 231 units for African elephants, respectively, with no differences between species (P>0.05). As mean leptin concentration increased there was an increase in the odds of a female being non-cycling (P = 0.0083). The G:I was associated inversely with body condition (P = 0.0002); as the G:I increased there was a decreased risk of BCS = 4 or 5 as compared to the ideal, or BCS = 3. Neither leptin nor G:I were predictive of foot or musculoskeletal health scores. Factors related to walking and feeding practices were most influential in predicting metabolic status, whereas social and housing factors showed smaller, but significant effects. The metabolic health benefits of walking were detected if the time spent in staff-directed walking was 7 hours or more per week. The most protective feeding practices included implementing a random rather than predictable feeding schedule and limiting the number of methods presentation methods. Results indicate that leptin levels and G:I can be used as predictors of both ovarian cycle function and body condition, and are affected by zoo management in elephants."
https://openalex.org/W2769077019,"Purpose Adults who stutter (AWS) are less accurate in their immediate repetition of novel phonological sequences compared to adults who do not stutter (AWNS). The present study examined whether manipulation of the following two aspects of traditional nonword repetition tasks unmask distinct weaknesses in phonological working memory in AWS: (1) presentation of stimuli with less-frequent stress patterns, and (2) removal of auditory-orthographic cues immediately prior to response. Method Fifty-two participants (26 AWS, 26 AWNS) produced 12 bisyllabic nonwords in the presence of corresponding auditory-orthographic cues (i.e., immediate repetition task), and the absence of auditory-orthographic cues (i.e., short-term recall task). Half of each cohort (13 AWS, 13 AWNS) were exposed to the stimuli with high-frequency trochaic stress, and half (13 AWS, 13 AWNS) were exposed to identical stimuli with lower-frequency iambic stress. Results No differences in immediate repetition accuracy for trochaic or iambic nonwords were observed for either group. However, AWS were less accurate when recalling iambic nonwords than trochaic nonwords in the absence of auditory-orthographic cues. Conclusions Manipulation of two factors which may minimize phonological demand during standard nonword repetition tasks increased the number of errors in AWS compared to AWNS. These findings suggest greater vulnerability in phonological working memory in AWS, even when producing nonwords as short as two syllables."
https://openalex.org/W2769069192,"Traditional therapies for pancreatic cancer are usually expensive and likely to cause side effects, and most patients have the risk of recurrence and suffering pain. Here, we investigated combination treatment of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and non-invasive low strength pulsed electric field (PEF) on the human pancreatic cell line PANC-1. Cells were cultured in various concentrations of EGCG and exposed to trains of PEF. The results showed that the low strength PEF alone or single treatment with low concentration of EGCG did not obviously affect the cell proliferation and migration in PANC-1. However, the EGCG-induced inhibitions of cell viability and migration ability in PANC-1 were dramatically enhanced by the further exposure of low strength PEF (60 V/cm). In particular, the same combination treatment caused less inhibition of cell viability in non-malignant HEK293 cells. We also found the combination treatment significantly decreased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax protein and increased caspase activity in PANC-1 cells, resulting in the promotion of apoptotic responses, evidenced by chromatin condensation. The findings of the present study reveal the synergistic reactions in the combination treatment may severely disturb mitochondria, enhance the intrinsic pathway transduction, and effectively induce apoptosis; moreover, the migration and invasion of PANC-1 cancer cells were also significantly suppressed. Since normal cells are less sensitive to this combination treatment, and the non-invasive PEF could be modified to focus on a specific location, this treatment may serve as a promising method for anti-cancer therapy."

In this study, we used MCAM/CD146, as a marker to localize, isolate and assay subendothelial clonogenic cells from the microvasculature of postnatal human skeletal muscle. We show here that these cells share with their BM counterpart, anatomic position (subendothelial/adventitial) and ex vivo clonogenicity (CFU-Fs). When assayed under the stringent conditions, these cells display a high spontaneous myogenic potential (independent of co-culture with myoblasts or of in vivo fusion with local myoblasts), which is otherwise only attained in cultures of satellite cells. These muscle-derived mural cells activated a myogenic program in culture. Cultured CD146+ cells expressed the myogenic factors (Pax7, Pax3 and Myf5), NCAM/CD56, desmin as well as proteins characteristic of more advanced myogenic differentiation, such as myosin heavy chain. In vivo, these cells spontaneously generate myotubes and myofibrils. These data identify the anatomy and phenotype of a novel class of committed myogenic progenitor in human post-natal skeletal muscle of subendothelial cells associated with the abluminal surface of microvascular compartment distinct from satellite cells."

Although this strategy is widely used in Arabidopsis thaliana, its use to study tissue-specific regulation of root symbiotic interactions in legumes has only started recently. Moreover, using tissue specific promoter activity to drive a GAL4-VP16 chimeric transcription factor that can bind short upstream activation sequences (UAS) is an efficient way to target and enhance the expression of any gene of interest. Here, we developed a collection of promoters with different root cell layers specific activities in Medicago truncatula and tested their abilities to drive the expression of a chimeric GAL4-VP16 transcription factor in a trans-activation UAS: β-Glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene system. By developing a binary vector devoted to modular Golden Gate cloning together with a collection of adapted tissue specific promoters and coding sequences we could test the activity of four of these promoters in trans-activation GAL4/UAS systems and compare them to “classical” promoter GUS fusions. Roots showing high levels of tissue specific expression of the GUS activity could be obtained with this trans-activation system. We therefore provide the legume community with new tools for efficient modular Golden Gate cloning, tissue specific expression and a trans-activation system. This study provides the ground work for future development of stable transgenic lines in Medicago truncatula."
https://openalex.org/W2768765746,"Previous studies have shown modulation of corticospinal output of the agonist muscle when a known-movement is prepared but withheld until a response signal appearance, reflecting motor preparation processes. However, modulation in the antagonist muscles has not been described, despite the fact that reaching movements require precise coordination between the activation of agonist and antagonist muscles. In this study, participants performed an instructed-delay reaction time (RT) task, with randomized elbow flexion and extension movements. The aim was to assess the time course modulation of corticospinal output in two antagonist muscles, by simultaneously quantified the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in biceps brachii and triceps brachii, and the amplitude and direction of elbow movements evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Depending on the prepared movement direction, a specific modulation of corticospinal output was observed, MEPs and TMS-evoked movements amplitude being relatively greater for extension compared to flexion. At the end of motor preparation, a decrease in MEPs amplitude was observed for both biceps brachii and triceps brachii, regardless of the prepared movement direction. In contrast, the probability of evoking movement in the flexion direction and the amplitude of TMS-evoked movement decreased at the end of preparation for flexion, but not for extension. Together, these results confirm the existence of inhibitory processes at the end of the motor preparation, probably to avoid a premature motor response. Moreover, they provide evidence of differences in the corticospinal control of elbow flexor and extensor muscles with patterns of modulation that are not necessarily reciprocal during motor preparation."

The fibrillar structure of Aβ30–36 has been detected by means of X-ray diffraction, but its oligomeric structural determination, biophysical characterization, and pathological mechanism remain elusive. In this study, we have investigated the structures of Aβ30–36 hexamer as well as its G33V and L34T mutants in explicit water environment using replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. Our results show that the wild-type (WT) Aβ30–36 hexamer has a preference to form β-barrel and bilayer β-sheet conformations, while the G33V or L34T mutation disrupts the β-barrel structures: the G33V mutant is homogenized to adopt β-sheet-rich bilayers, and the structures of L34T mutant on the contrary get more diverse. The hydrophobic interaction plays a critical role in the formation and stability of oligomeric assemblies among all the three systems. In addition, the substitution of G33 by V reduces the β-sheet content in the most populated conformations of Aβ30–36 oligomers through a steric effect. The L34T mutation disturbs the interpeptide hydrogen bonding network, and results in the increased coil content and morphological diversity. Our REMD runs provide structural details of WT and G33V/L34T mutant Aβ30–36 oligomers, and molecular insight into the aggregation mechanism, which will be helpful for designing novel inhibitors or amyloid-based materials."

However, basic information about genetic diversity, population structure, and morphological variation is still limited for this species. In this study, we sampled 420 P. mira individuals from 21 wild populations in the Tibet plateau to conduct a comprehensive analysis of genetic and morphological characteristics. The results of molecular analyses based on simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers indicated moderate genetic diversity and inbreeding (A = 3.8, Ae = 2.5, He = 0.52, Ho = 0.44, I = 0.95, FIS = 0.17) within P. mira populations. STRUCTURE, GENELAND, and phylogenetic analyses assigned the 21 populations to three genetic clusters that were moderately correlated with geographic altitudes, and this may have resulted from significantly different climatic and environmental factors at different altitudinal ranges. Significant isolation-by-distance was detected across the entire distribution of P. mira populations, but geographic altitude might have more significant effects on genetic structure than geographic distance in partial small-scale areas. Furthermore, clear genetic structure, high genetic differentiation, and restricted gene flow were detected between pairwise populations from different geographic groups, indicating that geographic barriers and genetic drift have significant effects on P. mira populations. Analyses of molecular variance based on the SSR markers indicated high variation (83.7% and 81.7%), whereas morphological analyses revealed low variation (1.30%-36.17%) within the populations. Large and heavy fruits were better adapted than light fruits and nutlets to poor climate and environmental conditions at high altitudes. Based on the results of molecular and morphological analyses, we classified the area into three conservation units and proposed several conservation strategies for wild P. mira populations in the Tibet plateau."
https://openalex.org/W2769231336,"Recent discoveries of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in HIV-1–infected individuals have led to the identification of several major “vulnerable sites” on the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein. These sites have provided precise targets for HIV-1 vaccine development, but identifying and utilizing many of these targets remain technically challenging. Using a yeast surface display–based approach, we sought to identify epitope-focused antigenic domains (EADs) containing one of the “vulnerable sites,” the CD4-binding site (CD4bs), through screening and selection of a combinatorial antigen library of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein with the CD4bs bnAb VRC01. We isolated multiple EADs and found that their trimeric forms have biochemical and structural features that preferentially bind and activate B cells that express VRC01 in vitro. More importantly, these EADs could induce detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies against genetically related autologous and heterologous subtype B viruses in guinea pigs. Our results demonstrate that an epitope-focused approach involving a screen of a combinatorial antigen library is feasible. The EADs identified here represent a promising collection of possible targets in the rational design of HIV-1 vaccines and lay the foundation for harnessing the specific antigenicity of CD4bs for protective immunogenicity in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2768139138,"Chl1 DNA helicase promotes sister chromatid cohesion and associates with both the cohesion establishment acetyltransferase Eco1/Ctf7 and the DNA polymerase processivity factor PCNA that supports Eco1/Ctf7 function. Mutation in CHL1 results in precocious sister chromatid separation and cell aneuploidy, defects that arise through reduced levels of chromatin-bound cohesins which normally tether together sister chromatids (trans tethering). Mutation of Chl1 family members (BACH1/BRIP/FANCJ and DDX11/ChlR1) also exhibit genotoxic sensitivities, consistent with a role for Chl1 in trans tethering which is required for efficient DNA repair. Chl1 promotes the recruitment of Scc2 to DNA which is required for cohesin deposition onto DNA. There is limited evidence, however, that Scc2 also directs the deposition onto DNA of condensins which promote tethering in cis (intramolecular DNA links). Here, we test the ability of Chl1 to promote cis tethering and the role of both Chl1 and Scc2 to promote condensin recruitment to DNA. The results reveal that chl1 mutant cells exhibit significant condensation defects both within the rDNA locus and genome-wide. Importantly, chl1 mutant cell condensation defects do not result from reduced chromatin binding of condensin, but instead through reduced chromatin binding of cohesin. We tested scc2-4 mutant cells and similarly found no evidence of reduced condensin recruitment to chromatin. Consistent with a role for Scc2 specifically in cohesin deposition, scc2-4 mutant cell condensation defects are irreversible. We thus term Chl1 a novel regulator of both chromatin condensation and sister chromatid cohesion through cohesin-based mechanisms. These results reveal an exciting interface between DNA structure and the highly conserved cohesin complex."

However, whether this extra sequence endows wDUT with additional properties is unknown. Herein, we present the crystal structures of wDUT in both ligand-free and ligand-bound forms. We observed that the pre-V insert in wDUT forms an unusual β-hairpin structure in the domain-swapping region and thereby facilitates a unique orientation of the adjacent C-terminal segment, positioning the catalytic motif V onto the active site of its own subunit instead of a third subunit. Consequently, wDUT employs two-subunit active sites, unlike the widely accepted paradigm that the active site of trimeric dUTPase is contributed by all three subunits. According to results from local structural comparisons, the active-site configuration of wDUT is similar to that of known dUTPases. However, we also found that residues in the second-shell region of the active site are reconfigured in wDUT as an adaption to its unique C-terminal orientation. We also show that deletion of the pre-V insert significantly reduces wDUT’s enzymatic activity and thermal stability. We hypothesize that this rare structural arrangement confers additional functionality to wDUT. In conclusion, our study expands the structural diversity in the conserved dUTPase family and illustrates how sequence insertion and amino acid substitution drive protein evolution cooperatively. dUTPases are essential enzymes for maintaining genome integrity and have recently been shown to play moonlighting roles when containing extra sequences.

https://openalex.org/W2769943663,"N-Glycosylation plays a fundamental role in many biological processes. Human diamine oxidase (hDAO), required for histamine catabolism, has multiple N-glycosylation sites, but their roles, for example in DAO secretion, are unclear. We recently reported that the N-glycosylation sites Asn-168, Asn-538, and Asn-745 in recombinant hDAO (rhDAO) carry complex-type glycans, whereas Asn-110 carries only mammalian-atypical oligomannosidic glycans. Here, we show that Asn-110 in native hDAO from amniotic fluid and Caco-2 cells, DAO from porcine kidneys, and rhDAO produced in two different HEK293 cell lines is also consistently occupied by oligomannosidic glycans. Glycans at Asn-168 were predominantly sialylated with bi- to tetra-antennary branches, and Asn-538 and Asn-745 had similar complex-type glycans with some tissue- and cell line–specific variations. The related copper-containing amine oxidase human vascular adhesion protein-1 also exclusively displayed high-mannose glycosylation at Asn-137. X-ray structures revealed that the residues adjacent to Asn-110 and Asn-137 form a highly conserved hydrophobic cleft interacting with the core trisaccharide. Asn-110 replacement with Gln completely abrogated rhDAO secretion and caused retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations of Asn-168, Asn-538, and Asn-745 reduced rhDAO secretion by 13, 71, and 32%, respectively. Asn-538/745 double and Asn-168/538/745 triple substitutions reduced rhDAO secretion by 85 and 94%. Because of their locations in the DAO structure, Asn-538 and Asn-745 glycosylations might be important for efficient DAO dimer formation. These functional results are reflected in the high evolutionary conservation of all four glycosylation sites. Human DAO is abundant only in the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and placenta, and glycosylation seems essential for reaching high enzyme expression levels in these tissues.

Here, we show that Asn-110 in native hDAO from amniotic fluid and Caco-2 cells, DAO from porcine kidneys, and rhDAO produced in two different HEK293 cell lines is also consistently occupied by oligomannosidic glycans. Glycans at Asn-168 were predominantly sialylated with bi- to tetra-antennary branches, and Asn-538 and Asn-745 had similar complex-type glycans with some tissue- and cell line–specific variations. The related copper-containing amine oxidase human vascular adhesion protein-1 also exclusively displayed high-mannose glycosylation at Asn-137. X-ray structures revealed that the residues adjacent to Asn-110 and Asn-137 form a highly conserved hydrophobic cleft interacting with the core trisaccharide. Asn-110 replacement with Gln completely abrogated rhDAO secretion and caused retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations of Asn-168, Asn-538, and Asn-745 reduced rhDAO secretion by 13, 71, and 32%, respectively. Asn-538/745 double and Asn-168/538/745 triple substitutions reduced rhDAO secretion by 85 and 94%. Because of their locations in the DAO structure, Asn-538 and Asn-745 glycosylations might be important for efficient DAO dimer formation. These functional results are reflected in the high evolutionary conservation of all four glycosylation sites. Human DAO is abundant only in the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and placenta, and glycosylation seems essential for reaching high enzyme expression levels in these tissues."

Chemotherapeutic intervention has demonstrated to have modest clinical efficacy with no curative potential in LMS patients. Previously, we demonstrated pan-HDAC inhibition to have a superior effect in various complex karyotypic sarcomas. In this study, our goal is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of mocetinostat alone and in combination with gemcitabine in LMS. Human leiomyosarcoma (LMS) cell lines were used for in vitro and in vivo studies. Compounds tested included the class I HDAC inhibitor, mocetinostat, and nucleoside analog, gemcitabine. MTS and clonogenic assays were used to evaluate the effect of mocetinostat on LMS cell growth. Cleaved caspase 3/7 analysis was used to determine the effects of mocetinostat on apoptosis. Compusyn software was used to determine in vitro synergy studies for the combination of mocetinostat plus gemcitabine. A LMS xenograft model in SCID mice was used to test the impact of mocetinostat alone, gemcitabine alone and the combination of mocetinostat plus gemcitabine. Mocetinostat abrogated LMS cell growth and clonogenic potential, and enhanced apoptosis in LMS cell lines. The combination of mocetinostat plus gemcitabine exhibited a synergistic effect in LMS cells in vitro. Similarly, mocetinostat combined with gemcitabine resulted in superior anti-LMS effects in vivo. Mocetinostat reduced the expression of gemcitabine-resistance markers RRM1, RRM2, and increased the expression of gemcitabine-sensitivity marker, hENT1, in LMS cells. LMS are aggressive, metastatic tumors with poor prognosis where effective therapeutic interventions are wanting. Our studies demonstrate the potential utility of mocetinostat combined with gemcitabine for the treatment of LMS."
https://openalex.org/W2769278381,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most economically important pathogens, that hinder the development of global pork industry. Its nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11), with the nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) domain, is essential for PRRSV genome replication and it also contributes to host innate immunity suppression. However, the immunogenicity and immune structure of PRRSV nsp11 have not been well investigated yet. In this study, a monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated 3F9, that against nsp11 was generated. Subsequently, a series of partially overlapped fragments, covered the nsp1140-223aa, were expressed to test the reactivity with mAb 3F9, and the 111DCREY115 was found to be the core unit of the B-cell epitope recognized by mAb 3F9. Further investigation indicated that both genotype 1 and genotype 2 PRRSV can be recognized by mAb 3F9, due to the 111DCREY115 is conserved in both genotype virus. Meanwhile, this epitope, localized at the surface of nsp11 in 3D structure, is confirmed to be able to induce humoral immune response in PRRSV infected pigs. These findings do not only provide an mAb tool to further investigate the function of nsp11, they also indicate the diagnostic potential for this epitope."
https://openalex.org/W2768594184,"It is important to understand the motor deficits of children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). Our understanding of this motor disorder can be enriched by computational models of motor control. One crucial stage in generating movement involves combining uncertain information from different sources, and deficits in this process could contribute to reduced motor function in children with CP. Healthy adults can integrate previously-learned information (prior) with incoming sensory information (likelihood) in a close-to-optimal way when estimating object location, consistent with the use of Bayesian statistics. However, there are few studies investigating how children with CP perform sensorimotor integration. We compare sensorimotor estimation in children with CP and age-matched controls using a model-based analysis to understand the process.We examined Bayesian sensorimotor integration in children with CP, aged between 5 and 12 years old, with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels 1-3 and compared their estimation behavior with age-matched typically-developing (TD) children. We used a simple sensorimotor estimation task which requires participants to combine probabilistic information from different sources: a likelihood distribution (current sensory information) with a prior distribution (learned target information). In order to examine sensorimotor integration, we quantified how participants weighed statistical information from the two sources (prior and likelihood) and compared this to the statistical optimal weighting. We found that the weighing of statistical information in children with CP was as statistically efficient as that of TD children.We conclude that Bayesian sensorimotor integration is not impaired in children with CP and therefore, does not contribute to their motor deficits. Future research has the potential to enrich our understanding of motor disorders by investigating the stages of motor processing set out by computational models. Therapeutic interventions should exploit the ability of children with CP to use statistical information."
https://openalex.org/W2770988704,"Narcolepsy is caused by the loss of hypocretin (Hcrt) neurons and is associated with multiple genetic and environmental factors. Although abnormalities in immunity are suggested to be involved in the etiology of narcolepsy, no decisive mechanism has been established. We previously reported chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 3 (CCR3) as a novel susceptibility gene for narcolepsy. To understand the role of CCR3 in the development of narcolepsy, we investigated sleep-wake patterns of Ccr3 knockout (KO) mice. Ccr3 KO mice exhibited fragmented sleep patterns in the light phase, whereas the overall sleep structure in the dark phase did not differ between Ccr3 KO mice and wild-type (WT) littermates. Intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) promoted wakefulness and suppressed both REM and NREM sleep in the light phase in both Ccr3 KO and WT mice. Conversely, LPS suppressed wakefulness and promoted NREM sleep in the dark phase in both genotypes. After LPS administration, the proportion of time spent in wakefulness was higher, and the proportion of time spent in NREM sleep was lower in Ccr3 KO compared to WT mice only in the light phase. LPS-induced changes in sleep patterns were larger in Ccr3 KO compared to WT mice. Furthermore, we quantified the number of Hcrt neurons and found that Ccr3 KO mice had fewer Hcrt neurons in the lateral hypothalamus compared to WT mice. We found abnormalities in sleep patterns in the resting phase and in the number of Hcrt neurons in Ccr3 KO mice. These observations suggest a role for CCR3 in sleep-wake regulation in narcolepsy patients."
https://openalex.org/W2768386811,"Dental microwear of four postcanine teeth of Exaeretodon argentinus was analyzed using both two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) methods to infer their masticatory jaw movements. Results of both methods were congruent, showing that linear microwear features (scratches) were well aligned and mostly directed to the antero-posterior direction in all four teeth examined. These findings support the palinal masticatory jaw movement, which was inferred in previous studies based on the observation of gross morphology of wear facets. In contrast, the lack of detection of lateral scratches confirmed the absence of the lateral jaw movement that was also proposed by a previous study. Considering previous microwear studies on cynodonts, palinal jaw movements observed in Exaeretodon evolved within cynognathian cynodonts from the fully orthal jaw movement of its basal member. Although there are currently only three studies of dental microwear of non-mammalian cynodonts including the present study, microwear analysis is a useful tool for the reconstruction of masticatory jaw movement and its future application to various cynodonts will shed light on the evolutionary process of jaw movement towards the mammalian condition in more detail."
https://openalex.org/W2769068564,"Helicobacter pylori is a genetically diverse bacterial species that colonizes the stomach in about half of the human population. Most persons colonized by H. pylori remain asymptomatic, but the presence of this organism is a risk factor for gastric cancer. Multiple populations and subpopulations of H. pylori with distinct geographic distributions are recognized. Genetic differences among these populations might be a factor underlying geographic variation in gastric cancer incidence. Relatively little is known about the genomic features of African H. pylori strains compared to other populations of strains. In this study, we first analyzed the genomes of H. pylori strains from seven globally distributed populations or subpopulations and identified encoded proteins that exhibited the highest levels of sequence divergence. These included secreted proteins, an LPS glycosyltransferase, fucosyltransferases, proteins involved in molybdopterin biosynthesis, and Clp protease adaptor (ClpS). Among proteins encoded by the cag pathogenicity island, CagA and CagQ exhibited the highest levels of sequence diversity. We then identified proteins in strains of Western African origin (classified as hspWAfrica by MLST analysis) with sequences that were highly divergent compared to those in other populations of strains. These included ATP-dependent Clp protease, ClpS, and proteins of unknown function. Three of the divergent proteins sequences identified in West African strains were characterized by distinct insertions or deletions up to 8 amino acids in length. These polymorphisms in rapidly evolving proteins represent robust genetic signatures for H. pylori strains of West African origin."
https://openalex.org/W2769255123,"Background Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are common in primary care resulting in substantial costs. Since antimicrobial resistance against antibiotics for UTIs is rising, accurate diagnosis is needed in settings with low rates of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Objective To compare the cost-effectiveness of different strategies to diagnose UTIs in women who contacted their general practitioner (GP) with painful and/or frequent micturition between 2006 and 2008 in and around Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Methods This is a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis using data from 196 women who underwent four tests: history, urine stick, sediment, dipslide, and the gold standard, a urine culture. Decision trees were constructed reflecting 15 diagnostic strategies comprising different parallel and sequential combinations of the four tests. Using the decision trees, for each strategy the costs and the proportion of women with a correct positive or negative diagnosis were estimated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to estimate uncertainty surrounding costs and effects. Uncertainty was presented using cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves. Results Most sequential testing strategies resulted in higher proportions of correctly classified women and lower costs than parallel testing strategies. For different willingness to pay thresholds, the most cost-effective strategies were: 1) performing a dipstick after a positive history for thresholds below €10 per additional correctly classified patient, 2) performing both a history and dipstick for thresholds between €10 and €17 per additional correctly classified patient, 3) performing a dipstick if history was negative, followed by a sediment if the dipstick was negative for thresholds between €17 and €118 per additional correctly classified patient, 4) performing a dipstick if history was negative, followed by a dipslide if the dipstick was negative for thresholds above €118 per additional correctly classified patient. Conclusion Depending on decision makers’ willingness to pay for one additional correctly classified woman, the strategy consisting of performing a history and dipstick simultaneously (ceiling ratios between €10 and €17) or performing a sediment if history and subsequent dipstick are negative (ceiling ratios between €17 and €118) are the most cost-effective strategies to diagnose a UTI."
https://openalex.org/W2768241647,"Visible Light Communications (VLC) is a cutting edge technology for data communication that is being considered to be implemented in a wide range of applications such as Inter-vehicle communication or Local Area Network (LAN) communication. As a novel technology, some aspects of the implementation of VLC have not been deeply considered or tested. Among these aspects, security and its implementation may become an obstacle for VLCs broad usage. In this article, we have used the well-known Risk Matrix methodology to determine the relative risk that several common attacks have in a VLC network. Four examples: a War Driving, a Queensland alike Denial of Service, a Preshared Key Cracking, and an Evil Twin attack, illustrate the utilization of the methodology over a VLC implementation. The used attacks also covered the different areas delimited by the attack taxonomy used in this work. By defining and determining which attacks present a greater risk, the results of this work provide a lead into which areas should be invested to increase the safety of VLC networks."
