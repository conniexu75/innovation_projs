https://openalex.org/W2026262579,"The use of chemical reagents as enzyme inhibitors has yielded information concerning the mechanism of inhibition and the role in catalysis played by active groups on the protein apoenzyme, the coenzyme, or the metal component. Inhibition analysis has also furnished valuable clues concerning the architecture, chemical properties, and catalytic mechanism of the active site of the enzyme. In many cases, in vivo effects of inhibitors can be closely correlated with in vitro inhibition of purified enzyme systems. The effects of antimicrobial and anticancer agents, insecticides, and drugs can often be explained in terms of enzyme inhibition. The design and synthesis of new inhibitors offers great promise when applied to the control of undesirable organisms and to the prevention and cure of disease in the immediate future."

https://openalex.org/W2071828684,"WE were unaware of the application by Dr. A. J. Quick and his associates during the past year of the hitherto unused term ‘erythrocytin’ to describe a clotting factor they discovered in erythrocytes. To avoid confusion attendant upon using the same term for two separate factors, we therefore propose renaming the factor we obtained from erythrocytes which inhibits the antibacterial activity of 8-hydroxyquinoline—a chelating agent. In future, we will therefore use the term ‘erythrochelatin’ instead of ‘erythrocytin’ to describe this inhibitor1."

https://openalex.org/W2016406569,"THE safe disposal of carcasses containing radioactive isotopes often presents a difficult problem. Even if a specially designed incinerator is available, it is still important that the amount of radioactive isotope in the material to be burned is kept as low as possible."
