https://openalex.org/W2998933571,"Transparent piezoelectrics are highly desirable for numerous hybrid ultrasound–optical devices ranging from photoacoustic imaging transducers to transparent actuators for haptic applications1–7. However, it is challenging to achieve high piezoelectricity and perfect transparency simultaneously because most high-performance piezoelectrics are ferroelectrics that contain high-density light-scattering domain walls. Here, through a combination of phase-field simulations and experiments, we demonstrate a relatively simple method of using an alternating-current electric field to engineer the domain structures of originally opaque rhombohedral Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) crystals to simultaneously generate near-perfect transparency, an ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficient d33 (greater than 2,100 picocoulombs per newton), an excellent electromechanical coupling factor k33 (about 94 per cent) and a large electro-optical coefficient γ33 (approximately 220 picometres per volt), which is far beyond the performance of the commonly used transparent ferroelectric crystal LiNbO3. We find that increasing the domain size leads to a higher d33 value for the [001]-oriented rhombohedral PMN-PT crystals, challenging the conventional wisdom that decreasing the domain size always results in higher piezoelectricity8–10. This work presents a paradigm for achieving high transparency and piezoelectricity by ferroelectric domain engineering, and we expect the transparent ferroelectric crystals reported here to provide a route to a wide range of hybrid device applications, such as medical imaging, self-energy-harvesting touch screens and invisible robotic devices. The use of alternating-current electric fields to control domain size in ferroelectric crystals affords excellent transparency, piezoelectricity and birefringence."
https://openalex.org/W3000731297,"The use of relative abundance data from next generation sequencing (NGS) can lead to misinterpretations of microbial community structures, as the increase of one taxon leads to the concurrent decrease of the other(s) in compositional data. Although different DNA- and cell-based methods as well as statistical approaches have been developed to overcome the compositionality problem, and the biological relevance of absolute bacterial abundances has been demonstrated, the human microbiome research has not yet adopted these methods, likely due to feasibility issues. Here, we describe how quantitative PCR (qPCR) done in parallel to NGS library preparation provides an accurate estimation of absolute taxon abundances from NGS data and hence provides an attainable solution to compositionality in high-throughput microbiome analyses. The advantages and potential challenges of the method are also discussed."

https://openalex.org/W3000049338,"The impact of topological defects associated with grain boundaries (GB defects) on the electrical, optical, magnetic, mechanical and chemical properties of nanocrystalline materials1,2 is well known. However, elucidating this influence experimentally is difficult because grains typically exhibit a large range of sizes, shapes and random relative orientations3–5. Here we demonstrate that precise control of the heteroepitaxy of colloidal polyhedral nanocrystals enables ordered grain growth and can thereby produce material samples with uniform GB defects. We illustrate our approach with a multigrain nanocrystal comprising a Co3O4 nanocube core that carries a Mn3O4 shell on each facet. The individual shells are symmetry-related interconnected grains6, and the large geometric misfit between adjacent tetragonal Mn3O4 grains results in tilt boundaries at the sharp edges of the Co3O4 nanocube core that join via disclinations. We identify four design principles that govern the production of these highly ordered multigrain nanostructures. First, the shape of the substrate nanocrystal must guide the crystallographic orientation of the overgrowth phase7. Second, the size of the substrate must be smaller than the characteristic distance between the dislocations. Third, the incompatible symmetry between the overgrowth phase and the substrate increases the geometric misfit strain between the grains. Fourth, for GB formation under near-equilibrium conditions, the surface energy of the shell needs to be balanced by the increasing elastic energy through ligand passivation8–10. With these principles, we can produce a range of multigrain nanocrystals containing distinct GB defects. Heteroepitaxy is used to precisely control the growth of Mn3O4 shells on the faces of a Co3O4 nanocube crystal, producing uniform grain boundary defects and highly ordered multigrain nanostructures."
https://openalex.org/W2999145262,"Classification is an important task at which both biological and artificial neural networks excel1,2. In machine learning, nonlinear projection into a high-dimensional feature space can make data linearly separable3,4, simplifying the classification of complex features. Such nonlinear projections are computationally expensive in conventional computers. A promising approach is to exploit physical materials systems that perform this nonlinear projection intrinsically, because of their high computational density5, inherent parallelism and energy efficiency6,7. However, existing approaches either rely on the systems’ time dynamics, which requires sequential data processing and therefore hinders parallel computation5,6,8, or employ large materials systems that are difficult to scale up7. Here we use a parallel, nanoscale approach inspired by filters in the brain1 and artificial neural networks2 to perform nonlinear classification and feature extraction. We exploit the nonlinearity of hopping conduction9–11 through an electrically tunable network of boron dopant atoms in silicon, reconfiguring the network through artificial evolution to realize different computational functions. We first solve the canonical two-input binary classification problem, realizing all Boolean logic gates12 up to room temperature, demonstrating nonlinear classification with the nanomaterial system. We then evolve our dopant network to realize feature filters2 that can perform four-input binary classification on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology handwritten digit database. Implementation of our material-based filters substantially improves the classification accuracy over that of a linear classifier directly applied to the original data13. Our results establish a paradigm of silicon-based electronics for small-footprint and energy-efficient computation14. The nonlinearity of hopping conduction in a disordered network of boron dopant atoms in silicon is used to perform nonlinear classification and feature extraction."
https://openalex.org/W2998889691,"Highly efficient neutron detectors are critical in many sectors, including national security1,2, medicine3, crystallography4 and astronomy5. The main neutron detection technologies currently used involve 3He-gas-filled proportional counters6 and light scintillators7 for thermalized neutrons. Semiconductors could provide the next generation of neutron detectors because their advantages could make them competitive with or superior to existing detectors. In particular, solids with a high concentration of high-neutron-capture nuclides (such as 6Li, 10B) could be used to develop smaller detectors with high intrinsic efficiencies. However, no promising materials have been reported so far for the construction of direct-conversion semiconductor detectors. Here we report on the semiconductor LiInP2Se6 and demonstrate its potential as a candidate material for the direct detection of thermal neutrons at room temperature. This compound has a good thermal-neutron-capture cross-section, a suitable bandgap (2.06 electronvolts) and a favourable electronic band structure for efficient electron charge transport. We used α particles from an 241Am source as a proxy for the neutron-capture reaction and determined that the compact two-dimensional (2D) LiInP2Se6 detectors resolved the full-energy peak with an energy resolution of 13.9 per cent. Direct neutron detection from a moderated Pu–Be source was achieved using 6Li-enriched (95 per cent) LiInP2Se6 detectors with full-peak resolution. We anticipate that these results will spark interest in this field and enable the replacement of 3He counters by semiconductor-based neutron detectors. The semiconductor 6LiInP2Se6 is used for the direct detection of thermal neutrons at room temperature, demonstrating good energy resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2999117095,"mRNA modification by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is involved in many post-transcriptional regulation processes including mRNA stability, splicing and promotion of translation. Accordingly, the recently identified mRNA methylation complex containing METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP has been the subject of intense study. However, METTL16 (METT10D) has also been identified as an RNA m6A methyltransferase that can methylate both coding and noncoding RNAs, but its biological role remains unclear. While global studies have identified many potential RNA targets of METTL16, only a handful, including the long noncoding RNA MALAT1, the snRNA U6, as well as the mRNA MAT2A have been verified and/or studied to any great extent. In this study we identified/verified METTL16 targets by immunoprecipitation of both endogenous as well as exogenous FLAG-tagged protein. Interestingly, exogenously overexpressed METTL16 differed from the endogenous protein in its relative affinity for RNA targets which prompted us to investigate METTL16's localization within the cell. Surprisingly, biochemical fractionation revealed that a majority of METTL16 protein resides in the cytoplasm of a number of cells. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of METTL16 resulted in expression changes of a few mRNA targets suggesting that METTL16 may play a role in regulating gene expression. Thus, while METTL16 has been reported to be a nuclear protein, our findings suggest that METTL16 is also a cytoplasmic methyltransferase that may alter its RNA binding preferences depending on its cellular localization. Future studies will seek to confirm differences between cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA targets in addition to exploring the physiological role of METTL16 through long-term knockdown."
https://openalex.org/W2998828900,"Purpose Preoperative neck ultrasound (US) for lateral cervical lymph nodes is recommended for all patients undergoing thyroidectomy for thyroid malignancy, but it is operator dependent. We aimed to develop a radiomics signature using US images of the primary tumor to preoperatively predict lateral lymph node metastasis (LNM) in patients with conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma (cPTC). Methods Four hundred consecutive cPTC patients from January 2004 to February 2006 were enrolled as the training cohort, and 368 consecutive cPTC patients from March 2006 to February 2007 served as the validation cohort. A radiomics signature, which consisted of 14 selected features, was generated by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model in the training cohort. The discriminating performance of the radiomics signature was assessed in the validation cohort with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The radiomics signature was significantly associated with lateral cervical lymph node status (p < 0.001). The AUC of its performance in discriminating metastatic and non-metastatic lateral cervical lymph nodes was 0.710 (95% CI: 0.649–0.770) in the training cohort and was 0.621 (95% CI: 0.560–0.682) in the validation cohort. Conclusions The present study showed that US radiomic features of the primary tumor were associated with lateral cervical lymph node status. Although their discriminatory performance was slightly lower in the validation cohort, our study shows that US radiomic features of the primary tumor alone have the potential to predict lateral LNM."
https://openalex.org/W3000051412,"Snus is an oral tobacco product that originated in Sweden. Snus products are available as fine-cut loose tobacco or in pre-portioned porous ""pouches."" Some snus products undergo tobacco pasteurization during manufacturing, a process that removes or reduces nitrite-forming microbes, resulting in less tobacco-specific nitrosamine content in the product. Some tobacco companies and researchers have suggested that snus is potentially less harmful than traditional tobacco and thus a potential smoking cessation aid or an alternative to continued cigarette consumption. Although snus is available in various countries, limited information exists on snus variants from different manufacturers.Moisture, pH, nicotine, and tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines (TSNAs) were quantified in 64 snus products made by 10 manufacturers in the United States and Northern Europe (NE). Reported means, standard errors, and differences are least-square (LS) estimates from bootstrapped mixed effects models, which accounted for correlation among repeated measurements. Minor alkaloids and select flavors were also measured.Among all product types, moisture (27.4%-59.5%), pH (pH 5.87-9.10), total nicotine (6.81-20.6 mg/g, wet), unprotonated nicotine (0.083-15.7 mg/g), and total TSNAs (390-4,910 ng/g) varied widely. The LS-mean unprotonated nicotine concentration of NE portion (7.72 mg/g, SE = 0.963) and NE loose (5.06 mg/g, SE = 1.26) snus were each significantly higher than US portion snus (1.00 mg/g, SE = 1.56). Concentrations of minor alkaloids varied most among products with the highest total nicotine levels. The LS-mean NNN+NNK were higher in snus sold in the US (1360 ng/g, SE = 207) than in NE (836 ng/g, SE = 132) countries. The most abundant flavor compounds detected were pulegone, eucalyptol, and menthol.Physical and chemical characteristics of US and NE products labeled as snus can vary considerably and should not be considered ""equivalent"". Our findings could inform public health and policy decisions pertaining to snus exposure and potential adverse health effects associated with snus."
https://openalex.org/W3000469627,"Storm surge and sea level rise (SLR) are affecting coastal communities, properties, and ecosystems. While coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands and marshes, have the capacity to reduce the impacts of storm surge and coastal flooding, the increasing rate of SLR can induce the transformation and migration of these natural habitats. In this study, we combined coastal storm surge modeling and economic analysis to evaluate the role of natural habitats in coastal flood protection. We focused on a selected cross-section of three coastal counties in New Jersey adjacent to the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR) that is protected by wetlands and marshes. The coupled coastal hydrodynamic and wave models, ADCIRC+SWAN, were applied to simulate flooding from historical and synthetic storms in the Mid-Atlantic US for current and future SLR scenarios. The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was used to project the potential migration and habitat transformation in coastal marshes due to SLR in the year 2050. Furthermore, a counterfactual land cover approach, in which marshes are converted to open water in the model, was implemented for each storm scenario in the present and the future to estimate the amount of flooding that is avoided due to the presence of natural habitats and the subsequent reduction in residential property damage. The results indicate that this salt marshes can reduce up to 14% of both the flood depth and property damage during relatively low intensity storm events, demonstrating the efficacy of natural flood protection for recurrent storm events. Monetarily, this translates to the avoidance of up to $13.1 and $32.1 million in residential property damage in the selected coastal counties during the ‘50-year storm’ simulation and hurricane Sandy under current sea level conditions, and in the year ‘2050 SLR scenario’, respectively. This research suggests that protecting and preserving natural habitats can contribute to enhance coastal resilience."
https://openalex.org/W3000098749,"Threatened and endangered green turtles (Chelonia mydas) are unique because as juveniles they recruit from pelagic to near-shore waters and shift from an omnivorous to primarily herbivorous diet (i.e. seagrass and algae). Nevertheless, when injured and ill animals are admitted to rehabilitation, animal protein (e.g. seafood) is often offered to combat poor appetite and emaciation. We examined how the fecal microbiome of juvenile green turtles changed in response to a dietary shift during rehabilitation. We collected fecal samples from January 2014 –January 2016 from turtles (N = 17) in rehabilitation at the Georgia Sea Turtle Center and used next generation sequencing to analyze bacterial community composition. Samples were collected at admission, mid-rehabilitation, and recovery, which entailed a shift from a mixed seafood–vegetable diet at admission to a primarily herbivorous diet at recovery. The dominant phyla changed over time, from primarily Firmicutes (55.0%) with less Bacteroidetes (11.4%) at admission, to primarily Bacteroidetes (38.4%) and less Firmicutes (31.8%) at recovery. While the microbiome likely shifts with the changing health status of individuals, this consistent inversion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes among individuals likely reflects the increased need for protein digestion, for which Bacteroidetes are important. Firmicutes are significant in metabolizing plant polysaccharides; thus, fewer Firmicutes may result in underutilization of wild diet items in released individuals. This study demonstrates the importance of transitioning rehabilitating green turtles to an herbivorous diet as soon as possible to afford them the best probability of survival."

https://openalex.org/W2999564636,"Intracerebral hemorrhage in preterm infants is a major cause of brain damage and cerebral palsy. The pathogenesis of cerebral hemorrhage is multifactorial. Among the risk factors are impaired cerebral autoregulation, infections, and coagulation disorders. Machine learning methods allow the identification of combinations of clinical factors to best differentiate preterm infants with intra-cerebral bleeding and the development of models for patients at risk of cerebral hemorrhage. In the current study, a Random Forest approach is applied to develop such models for extremely and very preterm infants (23–30 weeks gestation) based on data collected from a cohort of 229 individuals. The constructed models exhibit good prediction accuracy and might be used in clinical practice to reduce the risk of cerebral bleeding in prematurity."
https://openalex.org/W2999794597,"Paedomorphosis is an important evolutionary force. It has previously been suggested that a soft-substrate sediment-dwelling (infaunal) environment facilitates paedomorphic evolution in marine invertebrates. However, until recently this proposal was never rigorously tested with robust phylogeny and broad taxon selection. Here, for the first time, we present a molecular phylogeny for a majority of the 21 families of one of the largest nudibranch subgroups (Aeolidacea) and show that the externally highly simplified vermiform nudibranch family, Pseudovermidae, with clearly defined paedomorphic traits and inhabiting a soft-substrata environment, is a sister group to the complex nudibranch family, Cumanotidae. We also report the rediscovery of one of the most enigmatic nudibranchs-Xenocratena suecica-on the Swedish and Norwegian coasts 70 years after it was first found. Xenocratena was described from the same location and environment in the Swedish Gullmar fjord as one of the most enigmatic vermiform organisms, Xenoturbella bocki, which represents either an original simple bilaterian body plan or secondary simplification of a more complex organisation. Our results show that Xenocratena suecica reveals an onset of parallel paedomorphic evolution so we have proposed the new family, Xenocratenidae fam. n., to accommodate the molecular and morphological disparities we discovered. The paedomorphic origin of another aeolidacean family, Embletoniidae, is also demonstrated for the first time. Thus, by presenting three independent lineages from non-closely related aeolidacean families, Xenocratenidae fam. n., Cumanotidae and Embletoniidae, we confirm with phylogenetic data that a soft-substrata burrowing-related environment strongly favours paedomorphic evolution. We suggest criteria to distinguish ancestral and derived characters in the context of modifications of ontogenetic cycles. Applying an evolutionary model of the soft substrate-driven multiple paedomorphic origin of several families of nudibranch molluscs we propose that it is plausible to extend this model to other marine invertebrates and suggest that the ancestral organisation of the enigmatic metazoan, Xenoturbella, might correspond to the larval part of a complex ancestral bilaterian ontogenetic cycle with sedentary/semi-sedentary adult stages and planula-like larval stages."
https://openalex.org/W3122864405,"This paper explores the role of cheap excuses in product choice. If agents feel that they fulfill one ethical aspect, they may care less about other independent ethical facets within product choice. Choosing a product that fulfills one ethical aspect may then suffice for maintaining a high moral self-image in agents and render it easier to ignore other ethically relevant aspects they would otherwise care about more. The use of such cheap excuses could thus lead to a “static moral self-licensing” effect, and this would extend the logic of the well-known dynamic moral self-licensing. Our experimental study provides empirical evidence that the static counterpart of moral self-licensing exists. Furthermore, effects spill over to unrelated, ethically relevant contexts later in time. Thus, static moral self-licensing and dynamic moral self-licensing can exist next to each other. However, it is critical that agents do not feel that they fulfilled an ethical criterion out of sheer luck, that is, agents need some room so that they can attribute the ethical improvement at least partly to themselves. Outsiders, although monetarily incentivized for correct estimates, are completely oblivious to the effects of moral self-licensing, both static and dynamic."
https://openalex.org/W3000613737,"Pepsin plays an important role in laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), a risk factor for the development of hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (HPSCC). However, the role of pepsin in HPSCC is not clear. We show by immunohistochemistry that pepsin positivity occurs in a significant proportion of human primary HPSCC specimens, and in many cases matched adjacent uninvolved epithelia are negative for pepsin. Pepsin positivity is associated with nodal involvement, suggesting that pepsin may have a role in metastasis. Treatment of FaDu cancer cells with pepsin increased cell proliferation, possibly by inducing G1/S transition. We also observed significant changes in expression of genes involved in NF-kappaB, TRAIL and Notch signaling. Our data suggest that pepsin plays an important role in HPSCC and that targeting pepsin could have potential therapeutic benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2999326481,"The normal vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) generates almost perfectly compensatory smooth eye movements during a 'head-impulse' rotation. An imperfect VOR gain provokes additional compensatory saccades to re-acquire an earth-fixed target. In the present study, we investigated vestibular and visual contributions on saccade production. Eye position and velocity during horizontal and vertical canal-plane head-impulses were recorded in the light and dark from 16 controls, 22 subjects after complete surgical unilateral vestibular deafferentation (UVD), eight subjects with idiopathic bilateral vestibular loss (BVL), and one subject after complete bilateral vestibular deafferentation (BVD). When impulses were delivered in the horizontal-canal plane, in complete darkness compared with light, first saccade frequency mean(SEM) reduced from 96.6(1.3)-62.3(8.9) % in BVL but only 98.3(0.6)-92.0(2.3) % in UVD; saccade amplitudes reduced from 7.0(0.5)-3.6(0.4) ° in BVL but were unchanged 6.2(0.3)-5.5(0.6) ° in UVD. In the dark, saccade latencies were prolonged in lesioned ears, from 168(8.4)-240(24.5) ms in BVL and 177(5.2)-196(5.7) ms in UVD; saccades became less clustered. In BVD, saccades were not completely abolished in the dark, but their amplitudes decreased from 7.3-3.0 ° and latencies became more variable. For unlesioned ears (controls and unlesioned ears of UVD), saccade frequency also reduced in the dark, but their small amplitudes slightly increased, while latency and clustering remained unchanged. First and second saccade frequencies were 75.3(4.5) % and 20.3(4.1) %; without visual fixation they dropped to 32.2(5.0) % and 3.8(1.2) %. The VOR gain was affected by vision only in unlesioned ears of UVD; gains for the horizontal-plane rose slightly, and the vertical-planes reduced slightly. All head-impulse compensatory saccades have a visual contribution, the magnitude of which depends on the symmetry of vestibular-function and saccade latency: BVL is more profoundly affected by vision than UVD, and second saccades more than first saccades. Saccades after UVD are probably triggered by contralateral vestibular function."

Disassembly inhibits V-ATPase activity under low-glucose conditions by releasing peripheral V1 subcomplexes from membrane-bound Vo subcomplexes.

In yeast, acute glucose deprivation results in separation of the V1 subcomplex and V1 subunit C from the Vo subcomplex, and glucose readdition induces rapid reassembly of both V1 and V1 subunit C with Vo.

Upon glucose readdition, RAVE catalyzes recruitment of cytosolic V1 and V1 subunit C to the vacuolar membrane and assembly of functional V-ATPases. Yeast RAVE is a heterotrimeric complex comprised of three subunits, Rav1, Rav2, and Skp1 (18Seol J.H. Feldman R.M. Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Correll C.C. Lyapina S. Chi Y. Galova M. Claypool J.

Rav1 is the central component of RAVE and contains N-terminal and C-terminal binding sites for Rav2 and Skp1, respectively (19Smardon A.M. Nasab N.D. Tarsio M. Diakov T.T. Kane P.M. Molecular interactions and cellular itinerary of the yeast RAVE (regulator of the H+-ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes) complex.J. Biol.

Rav1 interacts independently with 1) V1 subcomplexes via one or more of the EG peripheral stalks, 2) V1 subunit C, and 3) the cytosolic N-terminal domain of Vph1 (Vph1NT) of the Vo subcomplex (19Smardon A.M.

Rav2 interacts with V1 subunit C, making V1 subunit C the only V-ATPase subunit that contains multiple RAVE-binding sites (19Smardon A.M. Nasab N.D. Tarsio M. Diakov T.T. Kane P.M. Molecular interactions and cellular itinerary of the yeast RAVE (regulator of the H+-ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes) complex.J. Biol.

Skp1, a component of many essential cellular complexes, including SCF (Skp1-cullin-F-Box) ubiquitin ligases, does not appear to interact directly with V-ATPase subunits (16Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Skp1 forms multiple protein complexes, including RAVE, a regulator of V-ATPase assembly.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3 (11283612): 384-39110.1038/35070067Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The rabconnectin-3 (Rbcn3) complex is the structural and functional homologue of RAVE in higher eukaryotes, but it appears to contain only two larger subunits and no Skp1 (20Sakisaka T. Takai Y. Purification and properties of rabconnectin-3.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403 (16473606): 401-40710.1016/S0076-6879(05)03035-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The Rbcn3 complex was shown to associate with V-ATPase subunits in Drosophila (21Yan Y. Denef N. Schüpbach T.

The Rbcn3α subunit has regions of homology to the N- and C-terminal domains of Rav1 but is almost twice as large. It was proposed that RAVE's role in glucose-dependent V-ATPase reassembly is to shuttle cytosolic V1 and V1 subunit C back to Vo at the vacuolar membrane and provide a template for complex assembly, thus improving the efficiency of V-ATPase reassembly (19Smardon A.M. Nasab N.D. Tarsio M. Diakov T.T. Kane P.M. Molecular interactions and cellular itinerary of the yeast RAVE (regulator of the H+-ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes) complex.J. Biol.

However, the cellular levels of Rav1 and Rav2 are only 5–10% of the levels of V1 subunits (24Ho B. Baryshnikova A. Brown G.W. Unification of protein abundance datasets yields a quantitative Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome.Cell Syst. 2018; 6 (29361465): 192-205.e310.1016/j.cels.2017.12.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), suggesting that RAVE's role must be catalytic, requiring multiple cycles of binding and release of V1 to achieve V-ATPase reassembly. We recently found that a significant portion of RAVE is present at the vacuolar membrane of glucose-replete cells, released from the membrane by glucose deprivation, and recruited back to the membrane upon glucose readdition (19Smardon A.M. Nasab N.D. Tarsio M. Diakov T.T. Kane P.M. Molecular interactions and cellular itinerary of the yeast RAVE (regulator of the H+-ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes) complex.J. Biol.

This recruitment and release of RAVE is entirely consistent with its role as a glucose-dependent chaperone and assembly factor. However, neither the molecular basis of the glucose-sensitive recruitment of RAVE nor the signaling mechanisms involved are known. The interaction between RAVE and V1 is not intrinsically glucose-sensitive. Rather, RAVE can bind to the V1 subdomain whether it is in the cytosol as a result of glucose deprivation or as a result of Vo mutations that prevent membrane association (17Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. The RAVE complex is essential for stable assembly of the yeast V-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (11844802): 13831-1383910.1074/jbc.M200682200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the current study, we find that only Vph1-containing Vo subcomplexes are required for glucose-dependent recruitment of RAVE to the vacuolar membrane. Previous binding data indicated that a fragment consisting of amino acids 679–898 of Rav1 (Rav1 679–898) binds directly to Vph1NT. We identified a six amino acid conserved motif in this region that is required for interaction of Rav1 679–898 with Vph1NT in vitro and for recruitment of RAVE to the vacuolar membrane in vivo. Although this interaction is not intrinsically glucose-sensitive, we tested whether mutations previously associated with altered assembly or reversible disassembly of the V-ATPase would affect steady-state levels of RAVE at the membrane in the presence or absence of glucose. We find that mutations in several glucose-sensing pathways significantly alter RAVE localization. The results indicate that the RAVE complex itself can be recruited to the vacuolar membrane without V1 and that its steady-state localization does not strictly follow that of V1 subcomplexes. Levels of RAVE subunits in isolated cytosolic fractions do not change with glucose levels (17Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. The RAVE complex is essential for stable assembly of the yeast V-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (11844802): 13831-1383910.1074/jbc.M200682200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and very little RAVE is isolated with vacuolar membranes containing the V-ATPase. However, using GFP-tagged RAVE subunits, we previously demonstrated that RAVE is reversibly released from the vacuolar membrane upon glucose deprivation and restored to the membrane upon glucose readdition (19Smardon A.M. Nasab N.D. Tarsio M. Diakov T.T. Kane P.M. Molecular interactions and cellular itinerary of the yeast RAVE (regulator of the H+-ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes) complex.J. Biol.

GFP-tagged Rav1 and Rav2 complement the growth phenotypes of the corresponding deletion mutants. We asked whether either subunit could be recruited to membranes in the absence of the other. As shown in Fig. 1, both Rav1-GFP and Rav2-GFP are present at the membrane, as well as the cytosol, in glucose-grown WT cells. In contrast, Rav2-GFP is almost completely cytosolic in rav1Δ cells, and Rav1-GFP is almost completely cytosolic in rav2Δ cells. We conclude that both Rav1 and Rav2 subunits must be present for efficient recruitment of the complex to the vacuolar membrane, and in subsequent experiments, we use Rav2-GFP to track localization of the RAVE complex. Although V1 subunit C is released from the vacuolar membrane upon glucose deprivation and is proposed to be a key player in reversible disassembly of the yeast V-ATPase, we previously found that the RAVE complex can be recruited to the vacuolar membrane in glucose-grown vma5Δ cells, which lack V1 subunit C. In addition, Rav2-GFP also cycles off and on the membrane with glucose deprivation and readdition in a vma5Δ mutant (19Smardon A.M. Nasab N.D. Tarsio M. Diakov T.T. Kane P.M. Molecular interactions and cellular itinerary of the yeast RAVE (regulator of the H+-ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes) complex.J. Biol.

V1 assembly is compromised (25Kane P.M. Tarsio M. Liu J. Early steps in assembly of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase.J. Biol.

Kane P.M. The RAVE complex is essential for stable assembly of the yeast V-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (11844802): 13831-1383910.1074/jbc.M200682200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), in a vma4Δ mutant, which lacks the V1 subunit E, so we compared Rav2-GFP localization in vma4Δ and WT strains. As shown in Fig. 2A, Rav2-GFP localized to the vacuolar membrane in both the vma4Δ and WT strains in the presence of glucose, suggesting that binding to the V1 subcomplex is not required for vacuolar localization of RAVE. We next tested whether Rav2-GFP was released from the membrane into the cytosol upon glucose deprivation. As shown in both images and line scans in Fig. 2A, vacuolar localization is lost in both vma4Δ and WT cells. However, glucose readdition restores vacuolar localization in both strains. In line scans for high glucose conditions in both strains, there are maxima of fluorescence intensity corresponding to the vacuolar membrane. To compare localization of Rav2-GFP across a larger population of the cells, we performed line scan measurements across 10–11 cells under each condition. The maximum fluorescence intensity for each scan was normalized to the average intensity of the cells maintained in glucose, and the results are plotted in Fig. 2B. For both WT and vma4Δ cells, there is a significant decrease in maximal intensity in the absence of glucose, but no significant difference after glucose readdition. From these data, we conclude that the association of RAVE with V1 is not required for glucose-dependent recruitment of RAVE to the vacuolar membrane. The results above were somewhat surprising, given that RAVE has been shown to interact with both V1 (17Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M.

We hypothesized that recruitment of RAVE to the membrane might solely depend on interaction with Vo subcomplexes and thus would be disrupted in a vma11Δ mutant, which lacks an essential subunit of the proteolipid ring in Vo and fails to assemble or transport Vo subcomplexes to the vacuole (27Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. VMA11 and VMA16 encode second and third proteolipid subunits of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase.J. Biol.

Indeed, Rav2-GFP remained cytosolic even in the presence of glucose in a vma11Δ strain (Fig. 3A), indicating that interactions with the Vo subcomplex are required for membrane recruitment of RAVE. We next asked whether Vo complexes needed to be free of V1 for RAVE to bind. A mutation of a critical glutamate (E145L) in VMA11 allows V-ATPase assembly, but abolishes both ATPase activity and proton transport (27Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. VMA11 and VMA16 encode second and third proteolipid subunits of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase.J. Biol.

The vma11 E145L mutant was shown to have increased levels of V1 subunits assembled at the vacuole, apparently as a result of assembly of virtually all Vo subcomplexes with V1 (27Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. VMA11 and VMA16 encode second and third proteolipid subunits of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase.J. Biol.

We introduced Rav2-GFP into this strain to assess whether RAVE was able to bind to fully assembled, but inactive, V-ATPases. Interestingly, Rav2-GFP was still able to bind to the membrane in presence of glucose and to be reversibly released upon glucose deprivation and readdition (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the site of RAVE interaction with the Vo subcomplex must be available when the V-ATPase is assembled and suggest that release and recruitment of RAVE do not require catalytic cycling of the V-ATPase. There are two isoforms of the Vo a-subunit, Vph1 and Stv1, but only V-ATPases containing the Vph1 isoform require RAVE for their assembly (29Smardon A.M. Diab H.I. Tarsio M. Diakov T.T. Nasab N.D. West R.W. Kane P.M. The RAVE complex is an isoform-specific V-ATPase assembly factor in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25 (24307682): 356-36710.1091/mbc.e13-05-0231Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We also found that the cytosolic domain of Vph1 (Vph1NT) binds directly to Rav1 in vitro (19Smardon A.M. Nasab N.D. Tarsio M. Diakov T.T. Kane P.M. Molecular interactions and cellular itinerary of the yeast RAVE (regulator of the H+-ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes) complex.J. Biol.

Consistent with these observations, we found that Rav2 failed to localize to the vacuolar membrane in a vph1Δ strain, even in the presence of glucose (Fig. 3C). This suggests that Vph1 is likely to be the molecular target for RAVE recruitment to the membrane. In fact, the Rav1-Vph1 interaction appears to be the central glucose-dependent interaction between the RAVE and V-ATPase complexes. Through a combination of bioinformatics, molecular modeling, and interaction assays (19Smardon A.M. Nasab N.D. Tarsio M. Diakov T.T. Kane P.M. Molecular interactions and cellular itinerary of the yeast RAVE (regulator of the H+-ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes) complex.J. Biol.

The C-terminal half of Rav1 (Rav1 840–1357) contains the most highly conserved portion of the protein (Rav1 840–1125), in a region that is predicted to be predominantly α-helical. The C-terminal half of Rav1 contains binding sites for V1, V1 subunit C, and Skp1. We identified a Vph1NT-binding site between the N- and C-terminal regions in a less conserved segment encompassing Rav1 679–898 (19Smardon A.M. Nasab N.D. Tarsio M. Diakov T.T. Kane P.M.

Sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of a conserved six amino acid motif (757LPVYHP in yeast; Fig. 4A). To determine whether this region was essential for RAVE function, we generated point mutations targeting conserved residues (rav1 760YH761 mutated to AA (YH-AA) and rav1 K773A). We also deleted the entire six amino acid motif (rav1 6Δ). The mutants were then tested for a Rav1− phenotype by comparing growth on plates buffered to low pH to growth on plates at high pH, with added calcium, at 37 °C (16Seol J.H. Shevchenko A.

https://openalex.org/W2998754286,"The appearance of the Linear Pottery Culture (LBK) on Poland territory initiated the process of neolithization in the area. However, as we will see in this article, this colonization took place later than previously thought. The stage, which in Poland is called as the early phase, actually corresponds only to the Fomborn/Ačkovy stage of LBK, and the earliest dating currently indicates around 5350 BC. Due to the small number of sites from this phase excavated on a large scale in Poland, this stage of the culture’s development is poorly known. The Gwoździec Project is focused on the earliest stage of LBK settlement in south-eastern Poland. Excavation at the site was finished in 2018. Therefore, the article presents preliminary results of interdisciplinary analyzes, such as research on ceramics, flint production and use, and botanical remains. They point to various aspects of the economy of these early agricultural communities and significantly enrich the knowledge of this period in Central Europe. They also expose the chronological development of the oldest LBK development stage in Poland."
https://openalex.org/W3000111059,"Background Tailoring interventions to the needs of caregivers is an important feature of successful caregiver support programs. To improve cost-effectiveness, group tailoring based on the stage of dementia could be a good alternative. However, existing staging strategies mostly depend on trained professionals. Objective This study aims to stage dementia based on caregiver reported symptoms of persons with dementia. Methods Latent class analysis was used. The classes derived were then mapped with disease duration to define the stages. Logistic regression with receiver operating characteristic curve was used to generate the optimal cut-offs. Results Latent class analysis suggested a 4-class solution, these four classes were named as early (25.9%), mild (25.2%), moderate (16.7%) and severe stage (32.3%). The stages based on the cut-offs generated achieved an overall accuracy of 90.8% compared to stages derived from latent class analysis. Conclusion The current study confirmed that caregiver reported patient symptoms could be used to classify persons with dementia into different stages. The new staging strategy is a good complement of existing dementia clinical assessment tools in terms of better supporting informal caregivers."

We report changes in the mtDNA number in 59% of FA patients studied, a high frequency of mtDNA variations (37.5% of non-synonymous variations and 62.5% synonymous variations) and downregulation of mtDNA complex-I and complex-III encoding genes of OXPHOS (p<0.05) as strong biomarkers for impairment of mitochondrial functions in FA. Deregulation of expression of mitophagy genes (ATG; p>0.05, Beclin-1; p>0.05, and MAP1-LC3, p<0.05) has also been observed, suggesting inability of FA cells to clear off impaired mitochondria. We hypothesize that accumulation of such impaired mitochondria in FA cells therefore may be the principal cause for bone marrow failure (BMF) and a plausible effect of inefficient clearance of impaired mitochondria in FA."

Mexican-Americans have a high prevalence of ADRD, but there is limited information on the healthcare use of older Mexican-Americans with ADRD. We used data from a cohort of older Mexican-Americans that has been linked with Medicare files to investigate differences in hospitalizations, ER admissions, and physician visits according to ADRD diagnosis. We also identify sociodemographic, health, and functional characteristics that may contribute to differences in healthcare utilization between Mexican-American Medicare beneficiaries with and without an ADRD diagnosis.Data came from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly that has been linked with Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary Files, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files, Outpatient Standard Analytic files, and Carrier files. The final analytic sample included 1048 participants. Participants were followed for two years (eight quarters) after their survey interview. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the probability for one or more hospitalizations, ER admissions, and physician visits at each quarter. ADRD was associated with higher odds for hospitalizations (OR = 1.65, 95%CI = 1.29-2.11) and ER admissions (OR = 1.57, 95%CI = 1.23-1.94) but not physician visits (OR = 1.23, 95%CI = 0.91-1.67). The odds for hospitalizations (OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 0.97-1.60) and ER admissions (OR = 1.27, 95%CI = 1.01-1.59) were reduced after controlling for limitations in activities of daily living and comorbidities.Mexican-American Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD had significantly higher odds for one or more hospitalizations and ER admissions but similar physician visits compared to beneficiaries without ADRD. Functional limitations and comorbidities contributed to the higher hospitalizations and ER admissions for older Mexican-Americans with ADRD."
https://openalex.org/W2999477504,"Elevational gradients are considered important for understanding causes behind gradients in species richness due to the large variation in climate and habitat within a small spatial extent. Geometric constraints are thought to interact with environmental variables and influence elevational patterns in species richness. However, the geographic setting of most mountain ranges, particularly continuity with low elevation areas may reduce the effect of geometric constraints at lower elevations. In the present study, we test the effects of climatic gradients and continuity with the low elevation plains of the eastern Himalayan mountain range on patterns of species richness. We studied species richness of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on an elevational gradient between 600m and 2400m in the Eastern Himalaya–part of Himalaya biodiversity hotspot. Ants were sampled in nine elevational bands of 200m with four transects in each band using pitfall and Winkler traps. We used regression models to identify the most important environmental variables that predict species richness and used constrained null models to test the effects of contiguity between the mountain range and plains. We find a monotonic decline in species richness of ants with elevation. Temperature was a more important predictor of species richness than habitat complexity. Geometric constraints model weighted by temperature with a soft lower boundary and hard upper boundary best explained the species richness pattern. This suggests that a combination of climate and geometric constraints drive the elevational species richness patterns of ants."
https://openalex.org/W2999645412,"Background Studies estimate that the number of cancer survivors will double by 2050 due to improvements in diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Despite the growing population of cancer survivors, there is a paucity of research regarding how these individuals experience the transition from active treatment to long-term surveillance. While research has explored this transition from more organized venues, such as support groups for cancer survivors, this paper explores the discourses surrounding cancer survivorship on social media, paying particular attention to how individuals who identify as cancer survivors represent their experience. Methods We identified social media posts relating to cancer survivorship on Twitter and Instagram in early June 2018, in order to coincide with National Cancer Survivorship Day on June 3, 2018. We used nine pre-selected hashtags to identify content. For each hashtag, we manually collected the 150 most recent posts from Twitter and the 100 most recent plus the top 9 posts from Instagram. Our preliminary sample included 1172 posts; after eliminating posts from one hashtag due to irrelevance, we were left with 1063 posts. We randomly sampled 200 of these to create a subset for analysis; after review for irrelevant posts, 193 posts remained for analysis (118 from Instagram and 75 from Twitter). We utilized a grounded theory approach to analyze the posts, first open-coding a subset to develop a codebook, then applying the codebook to the rest of the sample and finally memo writing to develop themes. Results Overall, there is substantial difference in the tone and thematic content between Instagram and Twitter posts, Instagram takes on a more narrative form that represents journeys through cancer treatment and subsequent survivorship, whereas Twitter is more factual, leaning towards advocacy, awareness and fundraising. In terms of content type, 120 posts (62%) of the sample were images, of which 42 (35%) were images of the individual posting and 28 (23%) were images of patients posted by family or friends. Of the remaining images, 14 (12%) were of support groups and 7 (6%) were of family or friends. We identified four salient themes through analysis of the social media posts from Twitter and Instagram: social support, celebrating milestones and honoring survivors, expressing identity, and renewal vs. rebirth. Discussion We observed a marked relationship between physical appearance, functional status and survivorship. Additionally, our findings suggest the importance of social support for cancer patients and survivors as well as the role social media can pay in identity formation. Conclusion Our findings suggest that individuals who identify as survivors on social media define their identity fluidly, incorporating elements of physical, emotional and psychological health as well as autonomy."
https://openalex.org/W3000498823,"The acceptance of students to a medical school places a considerable emphasis on performance in standardized tests and undergraduate grade point average (uGPA). Traditionally, applicants may be judged as a homogeneous population according to simple quantitative thresholds that implicitly assume a linear relationship between scores and academic success. This ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach ignores the notion that individuals may show distinct patterns of achievement and follow diverse paths to success. In this study, we examined a dataset composed of 53 variables extracted from the admissions application records of 1,088 students matriculating to NYU School of Medicine between the years 2006–2014. We defined training and test groups and applied K-means clustering to search for distinct groups of applicants. Building an optimized logistic regression model, we then tested the predictive value of this clustering for estimating the success of applicants in medical school, aggregating eight performance measures during the subsequent medical school training as a success factor. We found evidence for four distinct clusters of students—we termed ‘signatures’—which differ most substantially according to the absolute level of the applicant’s uGPA and its trajectory over the course of undergraduate education. The ‘risers’ signature showed a relatively higher uGPA and also steeper trajectory; the other signatures showed each remaining combination of these two main factors: ‘improvers’ relatively lower uGPA, steeper trajectory; ‘solids’ higher uGPA, flatter trajectory; ‘statics’ both lower uGPA and flatter trajectory. Examining the success index across signatures, we found that the risers and the statics have significantly higher and lower likelihood of quantifiable success in medical school, respectively. We also found that each signature has a unique set of features that correlate with its success in medical school. The big data approach presented here can more sensitively uncover success potential since it takes into account the inherent heterogeneity within the student population."
https://openalex.org/W2999976082,"Motivated by the One Health paradigm, we found the expected changes in temperature and UV radiation (UVR) to be a common trigger for enhancing the risk that viruses, vectors, and diseases pose to human and animal health. We compared data from the mosquito field collections and medical studies with regional climate model projections to examine the impact of climate change on the spreading of one malaria vector, the circulation of West Nile virus (WNV), and the incidence of melanoma. We analysed data obtained from ten selected years of standardised mosquito vector sampling with 219 unique location-year combinations, and 10 years of melanoma incidence. Trends in the observed data were compared to the climatic variables obtained by the coupled regional Eta Belgrade University and Princeton Ocean Model for the period 1961–2015 using the A1B scenario, and the expected changes up to 2030 were presented. Spreading and relative abundance of Anopheles hyrcanus was positively correlated with the trend of the mean annual temperature. We anticipated a nearly twofold increase in the number of invaded sites up to 2030. The frequency of WNV detections in Culex pipiens was significantly correlated to overwintering temperature averages and seasonal relative humidity at the sampling sites. Regression model projects a twofold increase in the incidence of WNV positive Cx. pipiens for a rise of 0.5°C in overwintering TOctober–April temperatures. The projected increase of 56% in the number of days with Tmax ≥ 30°C (Hot Days—HD) and UVR doses (up to 1.2%) corresponds to an increasing trend in melanoma incidence. Simulations of the Pannonian countries climate anticipate warmer and drier conditions with possible dominance of temperature and number of HD over other ecological factors. These signal the importance of monitoring the changes to the preparedness of mitigating the risk of vector-borne diseases and melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2998936450,"Purpose The aim of this study was to compare the concentration of blood lactate [bLa-] and the subjective perception of exertion of trained men in a moderate repetition protocol (MRP) versus a high repetition protocol (HRP) equated for time under tension. Methods A sample of 40 healthy young men (aged, 23.2 ± 4.0 years; height, 177.3 ± 7.0 cm; BMI, 24.3 ± 2.2) performed two sessions of 8 sets of bicep curls with a one-week recovery interval between the trials. In the HRP protocol, 20 repetitions were performed with a cadence of 2 seconds of eccentric and 1 second of concentric, while in the MRP protocol 10 repetitions were performed with 4 seconds of eccentric and 2 seconds of concentric. Cadences were controlled by a metronome. At the beginning and end of each of the sessions, blood lactate was taken at 2, 15, and 30 minutes, and rating of perceived exertion (OMNI-RES) was assessed immediately after completion of each session. Results There were [bLa-] differences between protocols in the MRP 2 min, (5.2 ±1.4); 15 min, (3.2 ±1.2); 30 min, (1.9 ±0.6); p< 0.05, and the HRP 2 min, (6.1 ±1.6); 15 min, (3.7 ±1.1); 30 min, (2.2 ±0.6); p<0.01. OMNI-RES was higher in HRP, (8.8 ±0.7) than in MRP, (7.7 ±0.9). Additionally, a correlation was found between the RPE and [bLa-] values in the HRP protocol (rs = 0.35, p < 0.01). Conclusions Training protocols with high times under tension promote substantial increases in metabolic stress, however, our findings indicate that HRP generates more [bLa-] than MRP. In addition, there were higher RPE values in the HRP protocol compared to MRP in single-joint exercises."

CN is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit called calcineurin A (CNA, ∼61 kDa) and a regulatory subunit (CNB, ∼19 kDa). CN plays important roles in the immune response, learning and memory, and cardiac hypertrophy (1Rusnak F. Mertz P. Calcineurin: form and function.Physiol.

NFAT has been the center of attention in studies on CN-substrate interactions. In resting cells, the hyperphosphorylated NFAT proteins reside in the cytoplasm (NFAT cytoplasmic 1–4, NFATc1-c4). Upon activation, CN dephosphorylates these proteins, which translocate to the nucleus. They regulate gene transcription via interaction with other transcription factors in the nucleus. The highly conserved PXIXIT motif (PALESPRIEITSCLGL, 16 aa, NFATc1-PXIXIT motif) was identified by Aramburu et al. (6Aramburu J. Garcia-Cózar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G.

The LXVP motif binds to a hydrophobic pocket at the interface of the CNA and CNB subunits.

RCAN1 also has the PXIXIT motif, and the LXVP motif closely matches the two motifs of NFAT.

However, the RCAN1-PXIXIT motif has a strong binding affinity for CN. It is worth noting that the RCAN1-PXIXIT motif in many studies refers to two independent and closely connected CN-interacting motifs: a PXIXIT-like site (208TPSVVVHVCES218, also called the E-motif), which resembles the PXIXIT motif from NFAT, located near the C terminus, and the more N-terminal CIC (calcineurin-inhibitor CALP1) motif (195PGEKYELHAATDT207, also called the V-motif). Replacement of the hydrophobic residues in the RCAN V-motif with the polar amino acid glutamine eliminated the interaction of the EV-motif with CN. Alanine substitution of the two conserved glutamic acid residues found in the E-motif reduced CN binding but did not abolish it. Therefore, it is suggested that the E-motif contributes to binding of the EV-motif to CN and that the major determinant lies within the hydrophobic PSVVVH motif. More importantly, only the synthetic peptide derived from the whole EV-motif (195PGEKYELHAATDTTPSVVVHVCES218) in RCAN1 could suppress CN-mediated NFAT-dependent cytokine gene expression in human T cells (16Martínez-Martínez S.

The protein inhibitor A238L from African swine fever virus is a physiological binding partner of CN. Grigoriu et al. (18Grigoriu S. Bond R. Cossio P. Chen J.A. Ly N. Hummer G. Page R. Cyert M.S. Peti W. The molecular mechanism of substrate engagement and immunosuppressant inhibition of calcineurin.Plos Biol. 2013; 11 (23468591): e100149210.1371/journal.pbio.1001492Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) used X-ray crystallography to investigate the structure of the A238L-CN complex and identified two binding motifs in A238L similar to those in NFAT. A238L (residues 200–239) binds CN in a largely extended conformation, stretching from the A238L-PXIXIT–binding site to the CNA/CNB interface and then looping back along the CNA/CNB interface to occupy the A238L-LXVP–binding pocket. They further summarized the features of the 10 CN substrates and regulators. The 17-aa GCEDNVYEKLPEQNSN sequence in A238L is the shortest linker in these CN-targeting proteins. The distance between the A238L-PXIXIT motif and the A238L-LXVP motif is 45 Å. By comparison, the linker between the two motifs in NFAT is 263 aa, as well as 54 aa in RCAN1. Based on our previous investigation of the two conserved motifs in CN substrates and targeting proteins, we designed a short polypeptide (Fig. 1A). The sequence of the peptide is constructed from three different substrates of CN: PGEKYELHAATDTTPSVVVH derived from the RCAN1-PXIXIT motif (pep1), GCEDNVYEKLPEQNSN derived from the A238L (linker), and YLAVPQHPYQWAK derived from the NFATc1-LXVP motif (pep2). We named the peptide pep3 and investigated the effects of pep3 in vitro and in vivo. We constructed plasmids encoding peptides fused to GST and compared the binding ability of pep1, pep2, linker, and pep3 with CNA in lysates of the mouse brain as a source of CN. CN normally consists of one catalytic subunit of CNA and a tightly bound regulatory subunit of CNB. This anti-CNA antibody used in our experiments could detect endogenous levels of CNA. We used an equivalent amount of input CNA in the GST pulldown assays. Anti-CNA immunoblotting showed that a GST control did not interact with CNA and that GST-pep3 pulled down more CNA than GST-pep1, GST-pep2, and GST-linker (Fig. 1B). Our pulldown data shows that A238L-linker and CNA have no obvious combination. Accordingly, the ratios of bound CNA to GST proteins were calculated (Fig. 1C). Compared with pep1 or pep2, pep3 has a stronger binding capacity with CNA. To quantitatively define the interaction between CN and pep3, we resorted to MST. MST is a sensitive and versatile biophysical technique for protein-peptide interaction studies. We mixed 31.3 nm fluorescently labeled pep3 with serial dilutions of CN (25 μm to 0.8 nm). The experiment was conducted in PBS. The result of the MST is shown in Fig. 2, A and B. The titration of CN yielded a biphasic MST signal. We performed an SDS denaturation test (SD-Test) to analyze the ligand-induced fluorescence changes. This test helps to distinguish between fluorescence changes caused by an interaction and changes caused by nonspecific effects, such as loss of protein due to aggregation or adsorption to labware. Our SD-Test results showed that the specific binding of ligand induced the fluorescence change. Then, we quantified the high-affinity binding from the first half of the data points, which yielded a dissociation constant Kd = 8.6 ± 0.3 nm. Fitting the low-affinity binding yielded a dissociation constant Kd = 1.6 ± 0.2 μm. The MST results demonstrate two binding phases between pep3 and CN. Pep3 binds CN with high affinity. In a previous study, Seidel et al. (19Seidel S.A. Dijkman P.M. Lea W.A. van den Bogaart G. Jerabek-Willemsen M. Lazic A. Joseph J.S. Srinivasan P. Baaske P. Simeonov A. Katritch I. Melo F.A.

Their study shows that MST can yield Kd data that are very comparable with those obtained by other well-established biophysical methods, including fluorescence polarization (FP) as a solution-based and surface plasmon resonance as a solid-phase technique. A more specific aspect of this system is the observation of a second binding phase that was identified in both the MST and surface plasmon resonance techniques. Based on our experimental data, we propose that pep3 binds CN at two major binding sites, a similar binding pattern to that between A238L and CN. Thus, the pep3-CN complex structure was modeled based on the crystal structure of the A238L-CN complex (PDB ID 4F0Z). A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation initiated from the model structure suggests that the two CN-binding motifs YLAVP and PSVVVH dock at the binding sites (Fig. 2C), which are highly similar to the LXVP- and PXIXIT-binding motifs in A238L and other peptide inhibitors. We also assayed the inhibition of the purified CN by pep3. Pep3 had a potent inhibitory effect on CN activity (Fig. 2D). The IC50 value for pep3 was 400 nm. We further determined the CN activity in lysates of Jurkat T cells in the presence of various concentrations of pep3. The IC50 value of pep3 for CN was 11 nm (Fig. 2E). Our results show that pep3 is a very strong inhibitor of CN. We also tested the CN-pep3 interaction in live cells in coprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells. Compared with the DMSO control group, CNA was clearly pulled down after transfection of 2 μg of pep3 (Fig. 3A). We also examined the in vivo effect of pep3 on the CN/NFAT signaling pathway. Fig. 3, B and C, show that transfection of pep3 could prevent the ionomycin-triggered nuclear import of GFP-NFATc3 in HeLa cells. Using luciferase reporter gene assays, we found that pep3 also inhibited NFAT-driven promoters (Fig. 3D). Our experimental results show that expression of pep3 effectively inhibits the CN/NFAT signaling pathway. 11-Arginine has been developed for the delivery of bioactive peptides into eukaryotic cells (20Noguchi H.

We synthesized an 11R-modified pep3 and investigated the polypeptide transduction efficiency. We used FITC-pep3 as a control peptide. Jurkat cells were treated with FITC-conjugated 11R-pep3. To examine the intracellular localization of 11R-pep3, Jurkat cells were incubated with 1, 2, 5, and 10 μm FITC-conjugated 11R-pep3 for 20 min, and the FITC fluorescence was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Twenty minutes after transduction, only FITC-11R-pep3 was observed as a fluorescent signal in all living Jurkat cells. FITC fluorescence was visualized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A). FITC-11R-pep3 was transduced in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). We also examined the effect of 11R-pep3 on the phosphorylation of endogenous NFAT1. Compared with the ionomycin group, incubation with 11R-pep3 resulted in a significant increase of NFAT1 in cytoplasm (Fig. 4C) and a decrease in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4D). Our data suggests that the cell-permeable peptide prevented the dephosphorylation of NFAT induced by ionomycin stimulation. To test the effect of 11R-pep3 on endogenous interleukin-2 transcription, we treated Jurkat cells with 11R-pep3 or CsA for 1 h and then treated them with PMA + ionomycin for an additional 6 h. We examined the IL-2 mRNA expression. Compared with the ionomycin group, IL-2 transcription in the cells treated with 11R-pep3 was significantly inhibited. As a positive control, CsA inhibited the expression of IL-2 mRNA (Fig. 4D). ELISA experiments further confirmed the effects of 11R-pep3 at the IL-2 protein level (Fig. 4E). To evaluate the functional effects of pep3 in vivo, we intranasally administered 11R-pep3 in an animal model of asthma. CsA was used as a positive control. Some articles have reported the inhibitory effects of T cells in OVA-induced asthma murine model by CsA (23Roh S.S. Kim S.H. Lee Y.C. Seo Y.B. Effects of radix adenophorae and cyclosporine A on an OVA-induced murine model of asthma by suppressing to T cells activity, eosinophilia, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.Mediators Inflamm. 2008; (18382613)10.1155/2008/781425Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Fukuda T.

Immunol. 1995; 75 (7621064): 65-72PubMed Google Scholar). We used the OVA-induced experimental asthma model. Before the OVA challenge, 200 μg of 11R-pep3 or CsA was administered intranasally. As expected, the OVA group of mice showed obvious airway hyperresponsiveness. Inhalation of methacholine (MCh) increased the values of RI in mice. Compared with animals with experimental allergic asthma, 11R-pep3–treated animals revealed a significant improvement in reactivity toward inhaled MCh (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, 11R-pep3 treatment inhibited allergic airway inflammation with significantly decreased numbers of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Fig. 5, B and C). The histological examination by H&E staining showed that the OVA challenge induced obvious infiltration of inflammatory cells around the trachea and interstitium, thickening of the tracheal wall, and exuberant secretion of tracheal mucosal epithelium and eosinophil cells (Fig. 5D). Remarkably, in the 11R-pep3–treated group, a small amount of inflammatory cells infiltrated, and no significant tracheal wall thickening or eosinophils were observed. Our PAS staining shows that OVA treatment also resulted in goblet cell metaplasia. The treatment of 11R-pep3 can significantly improve the histopathological phenomenon induced by OVA (Fig. 5E). Subsequently, inflammatory changes were graded by histopathological assessment. A relatively high grade was observed in the OVA challenge group. The grade was decreased significantly in the treatment of 11R-pep3 (Fig. 5F). Our results suggest that the intranasal administration of 11R-pep3 strongly suppressed allergic airway inflammation as an efficient immunosuppressant. Protein-protein interactions play important regulatory roles in pathological and physiological processes and are closely related to human diseases.

However, among the studied LXVP-type peptides in our experiments, the DQYLAVPQHPYQWAK peptide derived from NFATc1 shows a very strong binding ability with CN and potent inhibition of CN activity. The hydrophobic Leu and Val residues for targeting substrates to CN are very important, and the aromatic residue Tyr acts as a binding strength enhancer. Substitutions of the Tyr, Leu, and Val residues weakened the interactions between CN and LXVP-type motifs, such as YLAVP to HLAPP in the RCAN1-LXVP motif. We confirmed the results by experiments with GST pulldown and CN activity assays. We also found that the proline (YLAVP or HLAPP) residues in the LXVP motif were very important. Amino acids vary in their ability to form the various secondary structure elements. In natural proteins and peptides, proline is the most efficient helix breaking residue because it conflicts sterically with the helical conformation and, additionally, because its nitrogen cannot engage in hydrogen bonding. For example, Lys232 of A238L, which is a noncanonical residue in the LXVP motif because it has a “Lys” instead of the expected “Pro,” does not interact with CN and is thus not important for CN recognition by A238L. Therefore, the NFATc1-LXVP sequence was adopted in our design. Mulero et al. (27Mulero M.C. Aubareda A. Orzáez M. Messeguer J. Serrano-Candelas E. Martínez-Hoyer S. Messeguer A. Pérez-Payá E.

We repeated the FP experiment and obtained similar results in our laboratory (data not shown). The FAM-labeled RCAN1-PXIXIT peptide is very suitable for binding experiments. Martinez-Martinez et al.

The full-length RCAN1-PXIXIT sequence includes two motifs, one containing the ELHA sequence (E-motif) and another the valine-rich sequence PSVVVH (V-motif). The integrity of the motif is necessary for targeting RCAN1 to CN because peptides of the individual E-motif or V-motif could not pull CN down in GST pulldown experiments. The E-motif contributes to the binding of the RCAN1-PXIXIT motif with CN, and the major deciding factor lies within the hydrophobic PSVVVH motif. Therefore, the conserved and important residues in the RCAN1-PXIXIT motif were fully incorporated into the sequence of pep3. Abrams et al. (28Abrams C.C. Chapman D.A. Silk R. Liverani E. Dixon L.K.

https://openalex.org/W3000138896,"We implemented population size estimation of female sex workers (FSW) and transgender women (TGW) in Sri Lanka in 2018 using several approaches (geographical mapping, service and unique object multiplier and a modified Delphi method during the stakeholder consensus meeting). Mapping was done in 49 randomly selected Divisional Secretariats, which provided a basis for extrapolation of size estimates to the national level. Two types of adjustments were applied on the mean (minimum-maximum) population estimate obtained during mapping: (1) an adjustment for mobility to reduce double counting of FSW and TGW frequenting multiple spots, obtained during mapping; (2) an adjustment for “a hidden population”, obtained from surveys among FSW and TGW. For the multiplier method, we used data from services of non-governmental organisations that FSW and TGW were in contact with, and surveys based on respondent-driven sampling. Surveys were carried out in the cities of Colombo (FSW, TGW), Kandy (FSW), Galle (FSW) and Jaffna (TGW). We estimated that there are 30,000 FSWs in Sri Lanka, with a plausible range of 20,000–35,000, which implies a prevalence of FSW of 0.56% (0.37–0.65%) among adult females. This study provided baseline estimates of 2,200 TGW in the country, with a plausible range of 2,000–3,500, which is 0.04% (0.04–0.07%) of adult male population. Our estimates of the proportional contribution of the FSW and TGW populations among the adult population in Sri Lanka are consistent with the The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) recommended estimates for Asia and the Pacific.

The current diagnostic criteria allow the use of CSF biomarkers to provide pathophysiological support for the diagnosis of AD. How these criteria should be operationalized by clinicians is unclear. Tools that guide in selecting patients in which CSF biomarkers have clinical utility are needed. We evaluated computerized decision support to select patients for CSF biomarker determination.We included 535 subjects (139 controls, 286 Alzheimer's disease dementia, 82 frontotemporal dementia and 28 vascular dementia) from three clinical cohorts. Positive (AD like) and negative (normal) CSF biomarker profiles were simulated to estimate whether knowledge of CSF biomarkers would impact (confidence in) diagnosis. We applied these simulated CSF values and combined them with demographic, neuropsychology and MRI data to initiate CSF testing (computerized decision support approach). We compared proportion of CSF measurements and patients diagnosed with sufficient confidence (probability of correct class ≥0.80) based on an algorithm with scenarios without CSF (only neuropsychology, MRI and APOE), CSF according to the appropriate use criteria (AUC) and CSF for all patients.The computerized decision support approach recommended CSF testing in 140 (26%) patients, which yielded a diagnosis with sufficient confidence in 379 (71%) of all patients. This approach was more efficient than CSF in none (0% CSF, 308 (58%) diagnosed), CSF selected based on AUC (295 (55%) CSF, 350 (65%) diagnosed) or CSF in all (100% CSF, 348 (65%) diagnosed).We used a computerized decision support with simulated CSF results in controls and patients with different types of dementia. This approach can support clinicians in making a balanced decision in ordering additional biomarker testing. Computer-supported prediction restricts CSF testing to only 26% of cases, without compromising diagnostic accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2999796505,"Introduction Research on stroke rehabilitation mainly concerns the first year of recovery, and there is a lack of knowledge regarding long-term rehabilitation needs and associated factors. Aim The aim was to explore the perceived needs for rehabilitation services of people six years after stroke and factors associated with having rehabilitation services needs met. Methods The study was a 6-year follow up of a prospective study on the rehabilitation process after stroke. Data on perceived needs for rehabilitation, personal factors, disease specific factors, and patient-reported disability were collected through face-to-face interviews in the participants’ homes. Logistic regression models were created to explore associations between having rehabilitation services needs met in 11 problem areas (dependent variable) and the independent variables: involvement in decisions regarding care and treatment, sex, age, sense of coherence, self-defined level of private financing, stroke severity, frequency of social everyday activities, perceived impact of stroke, and life satisfaction. Results The 121 participants had a mean age of 63 years at stroke onset and 58% were men. In all problem areas the majority (53–88%) reported having needs met at six years after stroke, however 47% reported unmet needs regarding fatigue and 45% regarding mobility. A lower perceived impact on participation was found to be associated with having rehabilitation services needs met in seven problem areas: mobility, falls, pain, fatigue, concentration, memory, and sight. The strongest association for having needs met was found for the independent variable, involvement in care and treatment, within the three problem areas mobility, falls, and speaking. Conclusion In a long-term perspective, there were several modifiable factors associated with having rehabilitation services needs met. The most prominent were perceived involvement in care and treatment, and perceived participation. These factors had a stronger association with having rehabilitation services needs met than disease specific factors six years after stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2999709220,"Descending cholinergic fibers innervate the cochlear nucleus. Spherical bushy cells, principal neurons of the anterior part of the ventral cochlear nucleus, are depolarized by cholinergic agonists on two different time scales. A fast and transient response is mediated by alpha-7 homomeric nicotinic receptors while a slow and long-lasting response is mediated by muscarinic receptors. Spherical bushy cells were shown to express M3 receptors, but the receptor subtypes involved in the slow muscarinic response were not physiologically identified yet. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings combined with pharmacology and immunohistochemistry were performed to identify the muscarinic receptor subtypes and the effector currents involved. Spherical bushy cells also expressed both M1 and M2 receptors. The M1 signal was stronger and mainly somatic while the M2 signal was localized in the neuropil and on the soma of bushy cells. Physiologically, the M-current was observed for the gerbil spherical bushy cells and was inhibited by oxotremorine-M application. Surprisingly, long application of carbachol showed only a transient depolarization. Even though no muscarinic depolarization could be detected, the input resistance increased suggesting a decrease in the cell conductance that matched with the closure of M-channels. The hyperpolarization-activated currents were also affected by muscarinic activation and counteracted the effect of the inactivation of M-current on the membrane potential. We hypothesize that this double muscarinic action might allow adaptation of effects during long durations of cholinergic activation."

https://openalex.org/W2999620426,"Vestimentiferan tubeworms are key taxa in deep-sea chemosynthetic habitats worldwide. As adults they obtain their nutrition through their sulfide-oxidizing bacterial endosymbionts, which are acquired from the environment. Although horizontal transmission should favor infections by various symbiotic microbes, the current paradigm holds that every tubeworm harbors only one endosymbiotic 16S rRNA phylotype. Although previous studies based on traditional Sanger sequencing have questioned these findings, population level high-throughput analyses of the symbiont 16S diversity are still missing. To get further insights into the symbiont genetic variation and uncover hitherto hidden diversity we applied state-of-the-art 16S-V4 amplicon sequencing to populations of the co-occurring tubeworm species Lamellibrachia barhami and Escarpia spicata that were collected during E/V Nautilus and R/V Western Flyer cruises to cold seeps in the eastern Pacific Ocean. In agreement with earlier work our sequence data indicated that L. barhami and E. spicata share one monomorphic symbiont phylotype. However, complementary CARD-FISH analyses targeting the 16S-V6 region implied the existence of an additional phylotype in L. barhami. Our results suggest that the V4 region might not be sufficiently variable to investigate diversity in the intra-host symbiont population at least in the analyzed sample set. This is an important finding given that this region has become the standard molecular marker for high-throughput microbiome analyses. Further metagenomic research will be necessary to solve these issues and to uncover symbiont diversity that is hidden below the 16S rRNA level."
https://openalex.org/W2999933152,"Introduction The relationship between benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants and trauma is of great importance because of increased consumption and the growing evidence of a positive association among older adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effect size of the association between the consumption of psychotropic medications /opioids and falls in patients who have suffered trauma by studying the role of other variables in this relationship. Method From 2011 to 2016, the presence of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants and other drugs in 1060 patients admitted for trauma at a level I trauma hospital was analysed. Multivariate models were used to measure the adjusted effect size of the association between consumption of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants and falls, and the effect of age on this association was studied. Results A total of 192 patients tested positive for benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants, with same-level falls being the most frequent mechanism of injury in this group (40.1%), with an odds ratio of 1.96 (1.40–2.75), p < 0.001. Once other covariates were introduced, this association was not observed, leaving only age, gender (woman) and, to a lesser extent, sensory conditions as variables associated with falls. Age acted as an effect modifier between benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants and falls, with significant effect sizes starting at 51.9 years of age. Conclusions The association between the consumption of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants and falls in patients admitted for trauma is conditioned by other confounding variables, with age being the most influential confounding variable."

The primary outcome was informed choice about PSA screening.Significantly more men in the long DA group (38%) made an informed choice than men who received the shorter DA (33%) (95% CI 1.1% to 8.2%; p = 0.008). On knowledge, the long DA group scored, on average, 0.45 points higher than the short DA group (95% CI 0.14 to 0.76; p = 0.004) and 5% more of the participants achieved an adequate knowledge score (95% CI 1.9% to 8.8%; p = 0.002). Men allocated the long DA were less likely to intend to have a PSA test in the future (53%) than men in the short DA group (59%). Both DAs rated highly on acceptability.Both DAs were useful and acceptable to men regardless of education level and both supported informed decision making. The long version resulted in higher knowledge, and a higher proportion of men able to make an informed choice, but the differences were small. Long DAs may be useful for men whose informational needs are not satisfied by a short DA."

The prototypic bis-benzylidine piperidone-based inhibitor RA190 is a michael acceptor that adducts Cysteine 88 of RPN13. In probing the pharmacophore, we showed the benefit of the central nitrogen-bearing piperidone ring moiety compared to a cyclohexanone, the importance of the span of the aromatic wings from the central enone-piperidone ring, the contribution of both wings, and that substituents with stronger electron withdrawing groups were more cytotoxic. Potency was further enhanced by coupling of a second warhead to the central nitrogen-bearing piperidone as RA375 exhibited ten-fold greater activity against cancer lines than RA190, reflecting its nitro ring substituents and the addition of a chloroacetamide warhead. Treatment with RA375 caused a rapid and profound accumulation of high molecular weight polyubiquitinated proteins and reduced intracellular glutathione levels, which produce endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress, and trigger apoptosis. RA375 was highly active against cell lines of multiple myeloma and diverse solid cancers, and demonstrated a wide therapeutic window against normal cells. For cervical and head and neck cancer cell lines, those associated with human papillomavirus were significantly more sensitive to RA375. While ARID1A-deficiency also enhanced sensitivity 4-fold, RA375 was active against all ovarian cancer cell lines tested. RA375 inhibited proteasome function in muscle for >72h after single i.p. administration to mice, and treatment reduced tumor burden and extended survival in mice carrying an orthotopic human xenograft derived from a clear cell ovarian carcinoma."

It merges current information on the distribution, conservation status and sensitivity of birds and bats to wind power with an integrated evaluation of wind resources (modelled wind speed), special planning status and technical perspectives of wind energy development. The paper includes assessment of the selected wildlife species which were described as sensitive to wind power (69 breeding and 43 migratory bird species and 17 bat species bats in the country). Used species level information allowed the precise identification of sensitive territories and might be used to mitigate negative wind farm effects using special measures based on species behavior. Finally, we delivered overlaps as possible conflicts among the most promising wind farm areas and the areas with high sensitivity in relation to bird and bat distribution. These overlaps point to the required attention and relevant decisions that are needed to ensure sustainable development of wind energy throughout the country. We suggest this tool for initial determination of appropriate areas for wind energy development in the country and as supplement to Environmental Impact Assessment."

Methods and results Under anesthesia, both hindlimbs in mice were subcutaneously injected with Evans blue dye to detect LVs. We tied the right collecting LV on the abdomen that passes through the inguinal lymph node (LN) at two points. The right and left sides comprised the operation and sham operation sides, respectively. Lymphography was performed to investigate the lymph flow after lymphatic ligation until day 30, using a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system. Anti-podoplanin antibody and 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) were used to detect LVs and lymphangiogenesis. Within 30 days, detours had developed in 62.5% of the mice. Detours observed between two ligation sites were enlarged and irregular in shape. Podoplanin+ LVs, which were located in the subcutaneous tissue of the upper panniculus carnosus muscle, connected to collecting LVs at the upper portion from the cranial ligation site and at the lower portion from the caudal ligation site. EdU+ cells were not observed in these detours. The sham operation side showed normal lymph flow and did not show enlarged pre-collecting LVs until day 30. Conclusions Detours after lymphatic ligation were formed not by lymphangiogenesis but through an enlargement of pre-collecting LVs that functioned as collecting LVs after lymphatic ligation. Further studies are required to explore the developmental mechanism of the lymphatic detour for treatment and effective care of lymphedema in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2998790309,"Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver resection depends upon the stage and histological grade of the tumor and the expression of certain biomarkers. However, it remains unclear which of these factors has the highest predictive value regarding HCC recurrence after surgical resection. Methods This study investigated the associations among clinicopathological characteristics, expression of biomarkers, and HCC recurrence after liver resection. Fifty-four patients having undergone liver resection for HCC were enrolled prospectively, and their data were analyzed retrospectively. Evaluated variables were clinical data, laboratory findings, modified Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage, vascular invasion, histological differentiation, and immunohistochemical staining for fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), vascular endothelial growth factor, and tumor-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors 1 and 2. Results Mean patient age was 58.6 years (range, 30–71), and the mean and SD for follow-up duration were 51.2 ± 34.8 months. Cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence rates were 32.9%, 53.6%, and 68.1%, respectively. In univariate analysis, FGFR2 (p = 0.026) and Edmonson-Steiner grade (E-S grade) (p = 0.030) were associated with recurrence after resection in HCC patients. In multivariate analyses, increased FGFR2 expression (p = 0.017) was the only significant predictor of HCC recurrence. Conclusions High FGFR2 expression had marginal association with poor E-S grade (p = 0.056). More intensive surveillance of HCC recurrence is warranted in HCC patients with increased FGFR2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2999212351,"High quality diagnostic imaging can provide increased diagnostic accuracy and help guide medical decision-making and management, however challenges for radiology in resource-limited settings are numerous. Diagnostic imaging and teleradiology have financial and logistical implications, so evidence of impact is crucial. We sought to test the hypothesis that the implementation of computed radiography with teleradiology consultation support will significantly change diagnoses and treatment plans in a resource limited setting.Paired before-after study to determine the therapeutic impact of an add-on diagnostic test. 'Preliminary Plan' and 'Final Plan' forms allowed direct comparison of diagnosis and treatment plans at initial consultation and following radiography and teleradiology. Consecutive consenting patients were included until the sample size (600) was reached. Changes in both diagnosis and treatment plan were analysed in the whole cohort, with sub-analyses of children aged <5 years, and cases of chest radiography.Final analysis included 536 cases. Diagnosis changed following radiography and teleradiology in 62% of cases, and treatment plans changed in 61%. In chest radiography cases, 70% of diagnoses and 62% of treatment plans changed, while in children <5 years 66% of diagnoses and 58% of treatment plans changed. Reduced final treatment plans were most common for exploratory surgery (72% decrease), surgical orthopaedic intervention (62% decrease), and TB treatment (52% decrease), allowing more conservative medical or surgical management in 61 cases. Increased final treatment plans were highest in the orthopaedic and interventional surgery and referral categories. Of 42 cases requiring interventional surgery in the final plan, 26 (62%) were identified only after radiography and teleradiology. 16 additional cases were indicated for orthopaedic surgery, 10 cases required patient transfer, and TB treatment was indicated in 45 cases. A change in the original prescription plan occurred in 41% of 536 cases, with one or more prescriptions stopped in 28% of all cases.We found that computed radiography with teleradiology had significant clinical value in this resource-limited setting, with the potential to affect both patient outcomes and treatment costs through providing improved diagnostics and avoiding unnecessary treatments and medications."
https://openalex.org/W2999874021,"The serum concentration of thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH) is drastically reduced by small increase in the levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and its prohormone, T4); however, the mechanism underlying this relationship is unknown. TSH consists of the chorionic gonadotropin α (CGA) and the β chain (TSHβ). The expression of both peptides is induced by the transcription factor GATA2, a determinant of the thyrotroph and gonadotroph differentiation in the pituitary. We previously reported that the liganded T3 receptor (TR) inhibits transactivation activity of GATA2 via a tethering mechanism and proposed that this mechanism, but not binding of TR with a negative T3-responsive element, is the basis for the T3-dependent inhibition of the TSHβ and CGA genes. Multiple GATA-responsive elements (GATA-REs) also exist within the GATA2 gene itself and mediate the positive feedback autoregulation of this gene. To elucidate the effect of T3 on this non-linear regulation, we fused the GATA-REs at -3.9 kb or +9.5 kb of the GATA2 gene with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene harbored in its 1S-promoter. These constructs were co-transfected with the expression plasmids for GATA2 and the pituitary specific TR, TRβ2, into kidney-derived CV1 cells. We found that liganded TRβ2 represses the GATA2-induced transactivation of these reporter genes. Multi-dimensional input function theory revealed that liganded TRβ2 functions as a classical transcriptional repressor. Then, we investigated the effect of T3 on the endogenous expression of GATA2 protein and mRNA in the gonadotroph-derived LβT2 cells. In this cell line, T3 reduced GATA2 protein independently of the ubiquitin proteasome system. GATA2 mRNA was drastically suppressed by T3, the concentration of which corresponds to moderate hypothyroidism and euthyroidism. These results suggest that liganded TRβ2 inhibits the positive feedback autoregulation of the GATA2 gene; moreover this mechanism plays an important role in the potent reduction of TSH production by T3."
https://openalex.org/W3000419686,"An integrative approach employing molecular, morphological and geographical data were applied to species delimitation among Deuteraphorura congeners occupying caves of the Western Carpathian Mts. A new species of Deuteraphorura from the Western Carpathians is described. D. muranensis sp. nov. belongs among species with 4 pso at the hind margin of the head and possesses highly troglomorphic features. It is conspicuous with its distinctly elongated claws and long, hair-like body chaetae. The status of the new species was confirmed by DNA barcoding based on the mitochondrial COI marker. Populations of D. kratochvili (Nosek, 1963), the most widespread species, were studied in detail. Both ABGD and PTP analyses brought results congruent with geography, i.e. the molecular and geographic distance of the populations were positively correlated. However, some molecular separation based on pairwise distance and the number of substitutions was indicated within two of the studied populations. Despite the indistinct morphological differences, the tested populations were well isolated both geographically and genetically, which indicates that each studied population may represent a cryptic species. The troglomorphy of cave Collembola at the northernmost border of the distribution of cave-adapted species in the Europe is discussed. It is clear that the level of troglomorphy is closely associated with conditions of the microhabitat occupied by the individual subterranean species. The results of our study enhance the importance of the Western Carpathians regarding the diversity pattern of obligate cave species in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2999455697,"We tested the hypothesis that the brain uses a variance-based weighting of multisensory cues to estimate head rotation to perceive which way is up. The hypothesis predicts that the known bias in perceived vertical, which occurs when the visual environment is rotated in a vertical-plane, will be reduced by the addition of visual noise. Ten healthy participants sat head-fixed in front of a vertical screen presenting an annulus filled with coloured dots, which could rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise at six angular velocities (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16°/s) and with six levels of noise (0, 25, 50, 60, 75, 80%). Participants were required to keep a central bar vertical by rotating a hand-held dial. Continuous adjustments of the bar were required to counteract low-amplitude low-frequency noise that was added to the bar’s angular position. During visual rotation, the bias in verticality perception increased over time to reach an asymptotic value. Increases in visual rotation velocity significantly increased this bias, while the addition of visual noise significantly reduced it, but did not affect perception of visual rotation velocity. The biasing phenomena were reproduced by a model that uses a multisensory variance-weighted estimate of head rotation velocity combined with a gravito-inertial acceleration signal (GIA) from the vestibular otoliths. The time-dependent asymptotic behaviour depends on internal feedback loops that act to pull the brain’s estimate of gravity direction towards the GIA signal. The model's prediction of our experimental data furthers our understanding of the neural processes underlying human verticality perception."
https://openalex.org/W2999639305,"Infant-parent attachment is highly selective and continues beyond essential care in primates, most prominently in humans, and the quality of this attachment crucially determines cognitive and emotional development of the infant. Altricial rodent species such as mice (Mus musculus) display mutual recognition and communal nursing in wild and laboratory environments, but parental bonding beyond the nursing period has not been reported. We presently demonstrated that socially and nutritionally independent mice still prefer to interact selectively with their mother dam. Furthermore, we observed gender differences in the mother-infant relationship, and showed disruption of this relationship in haploinsufficient Nbea+/- mice, a putative autism model with neuroendocrine dysregulation. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of murine infant-to-mother bonding beyond the nursing period."
https://openalex.org/W3000321261,"Background Patients with a history of tuberculosis (TB) have a high probability of recurrence because long-term cure is not always maintained in successfully treated patients. The aim of this study was to identify the probability of TB recurrence and its predictive factors in a cohort of socially vulnerable patients who completed treatment in the TB referral center in Catalonia, which acts as the center for patients with social and health problems. Methods This retrospective open cohort study included all patients diagnosed with TB who were admitted and successfully treated in Serveis Clínics between 2000 and 2016 and who remained disease-free for a minimum of 1 year after treatment completion. We calculated the incidence density of TB recurrences per person-years of follow-up. We also estimated the cumulative incidence of TB recurrence at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years of follow-up. Bivariate analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariate analysis was conducted using Cox regression. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results There were 839 patients and 24 recurrences (2.9%), representing 0.49 per 100 person-years. The probability of a recurrence was 0.63% at 1 year of follow-up, 1.35% at 2 years, and 3.69% at 5 years. The multivariate analysis showed that the predictive factors of recurrence were age older than 34 years (aHR = 3.90; CI = 1.06–14.34 at age 35–45 years and aHR = 3.88; CI = 1.02–14.80 at age >45 years) and resistance to at least one anti-TB drug (aHR = 2.91; CI = 1.11–7.65). Conclusions Attention should be paid to socially vulnerable persons older than 34 years with a previous episode of resistant TB. Surveillance resources should be directed toward adequately treated patients who nevertheless have a high risk of recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W3000176386,"Pregnancy is a period in life in which women are willing to improve their lifestyle. Providing proper information for these women is crucial for their health and the health of their offspring. Clear information about weak points in their nutritional and weight gain knowledge is the first step for proper health care assistance. There are a few previous studies evaluating the nutritional and weight gain knowledge of pregnant women. In the few studies available, different approaches were taken and there was no wider discussion on the content of the questionnaires attempting to measure level of knowledge. The aim of this study, designed in a pilot fashion, was to test the adequacy of the questionnaire as a research instrument in a group of 139 pregnant Polish women. The developed instrument is a 33-item questionnaire comprising four domains: weight gain, importance of nutrients, quality and quantity of food intake. The results of this study indicate that the questionnaire is stable and internal consistency is acceptable (Cronbach’s alpha > 0.7) for dimensions with more than four items. For dimensions with less than four items, internal consistency was poor (Cronbach’s alpha < 0.7). The cumulative explained variance for domains weight gain, importance of nutrients, quantity and quality of food intake was 54.74%, 42.74%, 54.42% and 48.99% respectively. Results from validity, reliability and factor analysis indicate that the questionnaire is adequate for its purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2999296829,"Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) modifies peptidylarginine and converts it to peptidylcitrulline in the presence of elevated calcium. Protein modification can lead to severe changes in protein structure and function, and aberrant PAD activity is linked to human pathologies. While PAD homologs have been discovered in vertebrates—as well as in protozoa, fungi, and bacteria—none have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster, a simple and widely used animal model for human diseases. Here, we describe the development of a human PAD overexpression model in Drosophila. We established fly lines harboring human PAD2 or PAD4 transgenes for ectopic expression under control of the GAL4/UAS system. We show that ubiquitous or nervous system expression of PAD2 or PAD4 have minimal impact on fly lifespan, fecundity, and the response to acute heat stress. Although we did not detect citrullinated proteins in fly homogenates, fly-expressed PAD4—but not PAD2—was active in vitro upon Ca2+ supplementation. The transgenic fly lines may be valuable in future efforts to develop animal models of PAD-related disorders and for investigating the biochemistry and regulation of PAD function."
