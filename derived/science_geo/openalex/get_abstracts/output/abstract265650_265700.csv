https://openalex.org/W2018669437,"A model is presented to explain the formation and morphologies of surfactant-silicate mesostructures. Three processes are identified: multidentate binding of silicate oligomers to the cationic surfactant, preferential silicate polymerization in the interface region, and charge density matching between the surfactant and the silicate. The model explains present experimental data, including the transformation between lamellar and hexagonal mesophases, and provides a guide for predicting conditions that favor the formation of lamellar, hexagonal, or cubic mesostructures. Model Q(230) proposed by Mariani and his co-workers satisfactorily fits the x-ray data collected on the cubic mesostructure material. This model suggests that the silicate polymer forms a unique infinite silicate sheet sitting on the gyroid minimal surface and separating the surfactant molecules into two disconnected volumes."
https://openalex.org/W1979168948,Arrays of ferromagnetic nickel and cobalt nanowires have been fabricated by electrochemical deposition of the metals into templates with nanometer-sized pores prepared by nuclear track etching. These systems display distinctive characteristics because of their one-dimensional microstructure. The preferred magnetization direction is perpendicular to the film plane. Enhanced coercivities as high as 680 oersteds and remnant magnetization up to 90 percent have also been observed.
https://openalex.org/W2124424452,"Crystallization is an important process in a wide range of scientific disciplines including chemistry, physics, biology, geology, and materials science. Recent investigations of biomineralization indicate that specific molecular interactions at inorganic-organic interfaces can result in the controlled nucleation and growth of inorganic crystals. Synthetic systems have highlighted the importance of electrostatic binding or association, geometric matching (epitaxis), and stereochemical correspondence in these recognition processes. Similarly, organic molecules in solution can influence the morphology of inorganic crystals if there is molecular complementarity at the crystal-additive interface. A biomimetic approach based on these principles could lead to the development of new strategies in the controlled synthesis of inorganic nanophases, the crystal engineering of bulk solids, and the assembly of organized composite and ceramic materials."
https://openalex.org/W1987323235,"Lunar soils contain micrometer-sized mineral grains surrounded by thin amorphous rims. Similar features have been produced by exposure of pristine grains to a simulated solar wind, leading to the widespread belief that the amorphous rims result from radiation damage. Electron microscopy studies show, however, that the amorphous rims are compositionally distinct from their hosts and consist largely of vapor-deposited material generated by micrometeorite impacts into the lunar regolith. Vapor deposits slow the lunar erosion rate by solar wind sputtering, influence the optical properties of the lunar regolith, and may account for the presence of sodium and potassium in the lunar atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2082578622,"Three-dimensional, spherical models of mantle convection in the earth reveal that upwelling cylindrical plumes and downwelling planar sheets are the primary features of mantle circulation. Thus, subduction zones and descending sheetlike slabs in the mantle are fundamental characteristics of thermal convection in a spherical shell and are not merely the consequences of the rigidity of the slabs, which are cooler than the surrounding mantle. Cylindrical mantle plumes that cause hotspots such as Hawaii are probably the only form of active upwelling and are therefore not just secondary convective currents separate from the large-scale mantle circulation. Active sheetlike upwellings that could be associated with mid-ocean ridges did not develop in the model simulations, a result that is in agreement with evidence suggesting that ridges are passive phenomena resulting from the tearing of surface plates by the pull of descending slabs."
https://openalex.org/W1993075768,"Much theoretical work has been devoted to understanding the role of strong electron correlations in high-temperature superconductivity mainly through magnetic interactions, but the possible role of electron correlation in ferroelectricity of metal oxides has not received attention. Diagonalization of a simple many-body, tight-binding Hamiltonian shows that the electron-lattice interaction is dramatically enhanced in some cases by strong electron correlation because of deformation-induced charge transfer. This effect may be closely related to ferroelectricity and superconductivity in transition metal oxides."
https://openalex.org/W2071902319,"Evidence from ice at the bottom of ice cores from the Canadian Arctic Islands and Camp Century and Dye-3 in Greenland suggests that the Greenland ice sheet melted extensively or completely during the last interglacial period more than 100 ka (thousand years ago), in contrast to earlier interpretations. The presence of dirt particles in the basal ice has previously been thought to indicate that the base of the ice sheets had melted and that the evidence for the time of original growth of these ice masses had been destroyed. However, the particles most likely blew onto the ice when the dimensions of the ice caps and ice sheets were much smaller. Ice texture, gas content, and other evidence also suggest that the basal ice at each drill site is superimposed ice, a type of ice typical of the early growth stages of an ice cap or ice sheet. If the present-day ice masses began their growth during the last interglacial, the ice sheet from the earlier (Illinoian) glacial period must have competely or largely melted during the early part of the same interglacial period. If such melting did occur, the 6-meter higher-than-present sea level during the Sangamon cannot be attributed to disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet, as has been suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2044207067,"Adsorption and segregation of n-hexadecane molecules from an equal by weight mixture of n-hexadecane and n-hexane to an Au(001) surface at 315 kelvin are studied with the use of molecular dynamics simulations. Preferential adsorption of n-hexadecane at the solid-to-liquid interface together with subsequent layer-by-layer growth of an ordered, wetting interface were observed. The long chains penetrate and adsorb at the interfacial layer by means of a sequential segmental mechanism involving end-segment anchoring and displacive desorption of preadsorbed n-hexane molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2079661349,"More than 40 base metal porphyry ore deposits in southwestern North America are associated with the Laramide orogeny (about 90 million to 50 million years ago). Rhenium-osmium dates on molybdenite, a rhenium-enriched sulfide common in many of the deposits, reveal that in individual deposits mineralization occurs near the final stages of magmatic activity irrespective of the time of inception, magnitude, or duration of magmatism. Deposits that differ widely in location and in the extent and timing of magmatism have nearly identical ages for mineralization. Rhenium-osmium-ages suggest that mineralization occurred during two distinct intervals from about 74 million to 70 million years ago and from 60 million to 55 million years ago. Most deposits that formed in the oldest interval are within the older Precambrian basement of northwestern Arizona, whereas the younger deposits are restricted to the younger Precambrian basement in southern Arizona and northern Mexico. Synchronous, widespread mineralization indicates that similar crust-mantle interaction occurred on a regional scale for ore deposits once thought to be the product of localized processes."

https://openalex.org/W1980859981,"The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is a free atmospheric mode that affects the equatorial lower stratosphere. With a quasi-regular frequency, the mean equatorial zonal wind alternates from easterly to westerly regimes. This oscillation is zonally symmetric about the equator, has its largest amplitude in the latitudinal band from 20 degrees S to 20 degrees N, and has a mean period of about 27 months. The QBO appears to originate in the momentum deposition produced by the damping in the stratosphere of equatorial waves excited by diabatic thermal processes in the troposphere. The results of three 10-year simulations obtained with three general circulation models are reported, all of which show the development in the stratosphere of a QBO signal with a period and a spatial propagating structure that are in good agreement with observations without any ad hoc parameterization of equatorial wave forcing. Although the amplitude of the oscillation in the simulations is still less than the observed value, the result is promising for the development of global climate models."
