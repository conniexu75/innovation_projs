https://openalex.org/W3172692239,"Suppressing nucleation over large areas Although formamidinium-based lead iodide (PbI 2 ) perovskites have a favorable bandgap and good thermal stability, the difficulty in controlling nucleation makes it difficult to grow high-quality, large-area films compared with methylammonium counterparts. Bu et al. show that adding N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone to the perovskite precursors forms an adduct with PbI 2 that promotes the formation of the desired black α-phase at room temperature. The addition of potassium hexafluorophosphate eliminated hysteresis by passivating interfacial defects and promoted long-term thermal stability at 85°C in unencapsulated devices. Large-area modules (17 square centimeters) achieved power conversion efficiencies of 20.4%. Science , abh1035, this issue p. 1327"

In Arabidopsis, a subfamily of ""helper"" NLRs is required by many ""sensor"" NLRs. Active NRG1.1 oligomerized, was enriched in plasma membrane puncta, and conferred cytoplasmic calcium ion (Ca2+) influx in plant and human cells. NRG1.1-dependent Ca2+ influx and cell death were sensitive to Ca2+ channel blockers and were suppressed by mutations affecting oligomerization or plasma membrane enrichment. Ca2+ influx and cell death mediated by NRG1.1 and ACTIVATED DISEASE RESISTANCE 1 (ADR1), another helper NLR, required conserved negatively charged N-terminal residues. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings demonstrated that Arabidopsis helper NLRs form Ca2+-permeable cation channels to directly regulate cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels and consequent cell death. Thus, helper NLRs transduce cell death signals directly."

Although mature cerebellar neuroanatomy is well studied, understanding of its developmental origins is limited. In this study, we systematically mapped the molecular, cellular and spatial composition of human fetal cerebellum by combining laser capture microscopy and SPLiT-seq single-nucleus transcriptomics. We profiled functionally distinct regions and gene expression dynamics within cell types and across development. The resulting cell atlas demonstrates that the molecular organization of the cerebellar anlage recapitulates cytoarchitecturally distinct regions and developmentally transient cell types that are distinct from the mouse cerebellum. By mapping genes dominant for pediatric and adult neurological disorders onto our dataset, we identify relevant cell types underlying disease mechanisms. These data provide a resource for probing the cellular basis of human cerebellar development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3168396907,"Existing compendia of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) are incomplete, in part because they are derived almost exclusively from small and polyadenylated RNAs. Here we present a more comprehensive atlas of the human transcriptome, which includes small and polyA RNA as well as total RNA from 300 human tissues and cell lines. We report thousands of previously uncharacterized RNAs, increasing the number of documented ncRNAs by approximately 8%. To infer functional regulation by known and newly characterized ncRNAs, we exploited pre-mRNA abundance estimates from total RNA sequencing, revealing 316 microRNAs and 3,310 long non-coding RNAs with multiple lines of evidence for roles in regulating protein-coding genes and pathways. Our study both refines and expands the current catalog of human ncRNAs and their regulatory interactions. All data, analyses and results are available for download and interrogation in the R2 web portal, serving as a basis for future exploration of RNA biology and function."
https://openalex.org/W3170169220,"The epigenome of macrophages can be reprogrammed by extracellular cues, but the extent to which different stimuli achieve this is unclear. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that is activated by all pathogen-associated stimuli and can reprogram the epigenome by activating latent enhancers. However, we show that NF-κB does so only in response to a subset of stimuli. This stimulus specificity depends on the temporal dynamics of NF-κB activity, in particular whether it is oscillatory or non-oscillatory. Non-oscillatory NF-κB opens chromatin by sustained disruption of nucleosomal histone-DNA interactions, enabling activation of latent enhancers that modulate expression of immune response genes. Thus, temporal dynamics can determine a transcription factor's capacity to reprogram the epigenome in a stimulus-specific manner."

Koning et al. examined US biomedical patents and found that although fewer women engage in commercial patenting compared with men, their patents are more likely to focus on women's health (see the Perspective by Murray). In an evaluation of biomedical articles, the researchers found that women were also more likely to make scientific discoveries that might lead to women's health patents. These findings demonstrate that a lack of representation among inventors translates into a lack of breadth in inventions. Science , aba6990, this issue p. 1345 ; see also abh3178, p. 1260"
https://openalex.org/W3170531935,"The motion of a mechanical object -- even a human-sized object -- should be governed by the rules of quantum mechanics. Coaxing them into a quantum state is, however, difficult: the thermal environment masks any quantum signature of the object's motion. Indeed, the thermal environment also masks effects of proposed modifications of quantum mechanics at large mass scales. We prepare the center-of-mass motion of a 10 kg mechanical oscillator in a state with an average phonon occupation of 10.8. The reduction in temperature, from room temperature to 77 nK, is commensurate with an 11 orders-of-magnitude suppression of quantum back-action by feedback -- and a 13 orders-of-magnitude increase in the mass of an object prepared close to its motional ground state. This begets the possibility of probing gravity on massive quantum systems."

https://openalex.org/W3172958954,"The interplay between light receptors and PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) serves as a regulatory hub that perceives and integrates environmental cues into transcriptional networks of plants1,2. Although occupancy of the histone variant H2A.Z and acetylation of histone H3 have emerged as regulators of environmentally responsive gene networks, how these epigenomic features interface with PIF activity is poorly understood3–7. By taking advantage of rapid and reversible light-mediated manipulation of PIF7 subnuclear localization and phosphorylation, we simultaneously assayed the DNA-binding properties of PIF7, as well as its impact on chromatin dynamics genome wide. We found that PIFs act rapidly to reshape the H2A.Z and H3K9ac epigenetic landscape in response to a change in light quality. Furthermore, we discovered that PIFs achieve H2A.Z removal through direct interaction with EIN6 ENHANCER (EEN), the Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of the chromatin remodeling complex subunit INO80 Subunit 6 (Ies6). Thus, we describe a PIF–INO80 regulatory module that is an intermediate step for allowing plants to change their growth trajectory in response to environmental changes. PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs reshape the H2A.Z epigenetic landscape in response to light quality changes in Arabidopsis thaliana, through an interaction with the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex."
https://openalex.org/W3172090041,"Although deep learning algorithms show increasing promise for disease diagnosis, their use with rapid diagnostic tests performed in the field has not been extensively tested. Here we use deep learning to classify images of rapid human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests acquired in rural South Africa. Using newly developed image capture protocols with the Samsung SM-P585 tablet, 60 fieldworkers routinely collected images of HIV lateral flow tests. From a library of 11,374 images, deep learning algorithms were trained to classify tests as positive or negative. A pilot field study of the algorithms deployed as a mobile application demonstrated high levels of sensitivity (97.8%) and specificity (100%) compared with traditional visual interpretation by humans—experienced nurses and newly trained community health worker staff—and reduced the number of false positives and false negatives. Our findings lay the foundations for a new paradigm of deep learning–enabled diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries, termed REASSURED diagnostics1, an acronym for real-time connectivity, ease of specimen collection, affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid, equipment-free and deliverable. Such diagnostics have the potential to provide a platform for workforce training, quality assurance, decision support and mobile connectivity to inform disease control strategies, strengthen healthcare system efficiency and improve patient outcomes and outbreak management in emerging infections. In a pilot field study conducted in rural South Africa, deep learning algorithms can accurately classify rapid HIV tests as positive or negative, highlighting the potential of deep learning–enabled diagnostics for use in low- and middle-income countries."

Bassis et al. used a dynamic ice model to demonstrate that this kind of collapse can be slowed either by upstream thinning of the ice sheet or by the resistive forces from sea ice and calved debris (see the Perspective by Golledge and Lowry). Conversely, when there is upstream ice thickening, a transition to catastrophic collapse can occur. Science , abf6271, this issue p. 1342 ; see also abj3266, p. 1266"

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been found to have major potential in delaying the aging process in tissues and organs. However, the mechanism underlying the anti-aging effects of MSC is not clear which limits clinical applications. In this study, we used adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) to perform anti-aging treatments on senescent cells and progeroid animal models. Following intervention with ADSCs, replicative senescence was delayed and metabolic homeostasis was transformed from catabolism to anabolism. Metabolomic tests were used to analyze different metabolites. We found that ADSCs acted to accelerate mitophagy which eliminated intracellular ROS and improved the quality of mitochondria. These processes acted to regulate the cellular metabolic homeostasis and ultimately delayed the process of aging. Allogeneic stem cell therapy in a Progeria animal model (DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) knockin, mitochondrial dysfunction) also showed that ADSC therapy can improve alopecia and kyphosis by promoting mitophagy. Our research confirms for the first time that allogeneic stem cell therapy can improve aging-related symbols and phenotypes through mitochondrial quality control. These results are highly significant for the future applications of stem cells in aging-related diseases."

This study shows that Holdemanella biformis, isolated from the feces of a metabolically healthy volunteer, ameliorates hyperglycemia, improves oral glucose tolerance and restores gluconeogenesis and insulin signaling in the liver of obese mice. These effects were associated with the ability of H. biformis to restore GLP-1 levels, enhancing GLP-1 neural signaling in the proximal and distal small intestine and GLP-1 sensitivity of vagal sensory neurons, and to modify the cecal abundance of unsaturated fatty acids and the bacterial species associated with metabolic health. Our findings overall suggest the potential use of H biformis in the management of type 2 diabetes in obesity to optimize the sensitivity and function of the GLP-1 system, through direct and indirect mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W3169937231,"The mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) is a functional subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane that tethers to the mitochondrial outer membrane and is essential for cellular homeostasis. A defect in MAM is involved in various neurological diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recently, we and others reported that MAM was disrupted in the models expressing several ALS-linked genes, including SOD1, SIGMAR1, VAPB, TARDBP, and FUS, suggesting that MAM disruption is deeply involved in the pathomechanism of ALS. However, it is still uncertain whether MAM disruption is a common pathology in ALS, mainly due to the absence of a simple, quantitative tool for monitoring the status of MAM. In this study, to examine the effects of various ALS-causative genes on MAM, we created the following two novel MAM reporters: MAMtracker-Luc and MAMtracker-Green. The MAMtrackers could detect MAM disruption caused by suppression of SIGMAR1 or the overexpression of ALS-linked mutant SOD1 in living cells. Moreover, the MAMtrackers have an advantage in their ability to monitor reversible changes in the MAM status induced by nutritional conditions. We used the MAMtrackers with an expression plasmid library of ALS-causative genes and noted that 76% (16/21) of the genes altered MAM integrity. Our results suggest that MAM disruption is a common pathological feature in ALS. Furthermore, we anticipate our MAMtrackers, which are suitable for high-throughput assays, to be valuable tools to understand MAM dynamics."

We devised a comprehensive three-phase framework to identify new lipid-associated genes and study the relationships among lipids, genotypes, gene expression and hundreds of complex human diseases from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (347 traits) and the UK Biobank (549 traits). Aside from 67 new lipid-associated genes with strong replication, we found evidence for pleiotropic SNPs/genes between lipids and diseases across the phenome. These include discordant pleiotropy in the HLA region between lipids and multiple sclerosis and putative causal paths between triglycerides and gout, among several others. Our findings give insights into the genetic basis of the relationship between plasma lipids and diseases on a phenome-wide scale and can provide context for future prevention and treatment strategies. An analytical framework based on transcriptome-wide association and electronic medical records provides insights into the relationship between plasma lipids and complex diseases on a phenome-wide scale."
https://openalex.org/W3166461882,"The development of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) has greatly increased the information storage capacity of DNA, allowing for transcription of unnatural RNA by the heterologously expressed T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) in Escherichia coli. However, little is known about how UBPs are transcribed by cellular RNA polymerases. Here, we investigated how synthetic unnatural nucleotides, NaM and TPT3, are recognized by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and found that Pol II is able to selectively recognize UBPs with high fidelity when dTPT3 is in the template strand and rNaMTP acts as the nucleotide substrate. Our structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulation provide structural insights into transcriptional processing of UBPs in a stepwise manner. Intriguingly, we identified a novel 3'-RNA binding site after rNaM addition, termed the swing state. These results may pave the way for future studies in the design of transcription and translation strategies in higher organisms with expanded genetic codes."
https://openalex.org/W3167921118,"Neuroinflammation is recognized as a hallmark of spinal cord injury (SCI). Although neuroinflammation is an important pathogenic factor that leads to secondary injuries after SCI, neuroprotective anti-inflammatory treatments remain ineffective in the management of SCI. Moreover, the molecular signatures involved in the pathophysiological changes that occur during the course of SCI remain ambiguous. The current study investigated the proteins and pathways involved in C5 spinal cord hemi-contusion injury using a rat model by means of 4-D label-free proteomic analysis. Furthermore, two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) transcriptomic datasets, Western blot assays, and immunofluorescent staining were used to validate the expression levels and localization of dysregulated proteins. The present study observed that the rat models of SCI were associated with the enrichment of proteins related to the complement and coagulation cascades, cholesterol metabolism, and lysosome pathway throughout the acute and subacute phases of injury. Intriguingly, the current study also observed that 75 genes were significantly altered in both the GEO datasets, including ANXA1, C1QC, CTSZ, GM2A, GPNMB, and PYCARD. Further temporal clustering analysis revealed that the continuously upregulated protein cluster was associated with immune response, lipid regulation, lysosome pathway, and myeloid cells. Additionally, five proteins were further validated by means of Western blot assays and the immunofluorescent staining showed that these proteins coexisted with the F4/80+ reactive microglia and infiltrating macrophages. In conclusion, the proteomic data pertaining to the current study indicate the notable proteins and pathways that may be novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of SCI."
https://openalex.org/W3169452551,"Injury to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), which is one of the most common complications of sepsis. GYY4137, a new synthetic compound of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has extensive biological benefits. In this study, we focused on the protective effects of GYY4137 on the BBB in septic mice and the underlying mechanisms. The results suggested that whether administrated at the same time or 3 hours after LPS injection, GYY4137 both significantly alleviated the clinical symptoms and the long-term prognosis. Besides, GYY4137 improved the pathological abnormalities of septic mice. Moreover, the degradation of tight junctions in the BBB was considerably inhibited by GYY4137. In addition, GYY4137 significantly attenuated inflammation and apoptosis in the brain. Furthermore, GYY4137 activated the Nrf2/ARE pathway through the sulfhydrylation of Keap1 and inhibited oxidative stress. ML385, the specific inhibitor of Nrf2, significantly reversed the protective effects of GYY4137 in sepsis mice. In conclusion, this study indicated that through the sulfhydrylation of Keap1, GYY4137 activated the Nrf2/ARE pathway and exerted anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and antioxidant effects in septic mice that consequently protected the integrity of the BBB and improved the clinical outcome of sepsis. Our findings suggest that GYY4137 might be a promising agent for the treatment of SAE."

https://openalex.org/W3166068943,"Glomerular mesangial cell (GMC)-derived pleiotropic cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1), contributes to hypercellularity in human and experimental proliferative glomerulonephritis. IL-1 promotes mesangial proliferation and may stimulate extracellular matrix accumulation, mechanisms of which are unclear. The present study shows that the beta isoform of IL-1 (IL-1β) is a potent inducer of IL-1 type I receptor-dependent Ca2+ entry in mouse GMCs. We also demonstrate that the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is an intracellular store-independent diacylglycerol-sensitive Ca2+ channel in the cells. IL-1β-induced Ca2+ and Ba2+ influxes in the cells were negated by pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated knockdown of TRPA1 channels. IL-1β did not stimulate fibronectin production in cultured mouse GMCs and glomerular explants but promoted Ca2+-dependent cell proliferation. IL-1β also stimulated TRPA1-dependent ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in the cells. Concomitantly, IL-1β-induced GMC proliferation was attenuated by TRPA1 and RAF1/ MEK/ERK inhibitors. These findings suggest that IL-1β-induced Ca2+ entry via TRPA1 channels engenders MAPK-dependent mesangial cell proliferation. Hence, TRPA1-mediated Ca2+ signaling could be of pathological significance in proliferative glomerulonephritis."
https://openalex.org/W3172139868,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disease. Although visceral hypersensitivity (VH) and disturbed gastrointestinal motility are typical pathophysiological features of IBS, the pathological mechanisms underlying this disease remain unclear. Serotonin system abnormalities are considered to play an important role in the pathomechanisms of IBS. Here, we hypothesize that similar alterations, including VH and colonic motility, induced by serotonin transporter (SERT) knockout result from altered serotonin signaling. We sought to determine the molecular mechanism underlying VH and colonic dysmotility induced by SERT knockout. We found that female SERT (slc6a4)-knockout (KO; ie, slc6a4−/−) rats exhibited lower pain pressure thresholds (PPTs) than wild-type (WT; ie, slc6a4+/+) rats in response to colorectal distension (CRD). Significantly increased fecal pellet output and reduced concentration of serum tryptophan were observed in the female SERT KO rats. The concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and serum in SERT KO rats were lower than those in WT rats, but the numbers of enterochromaffin cells (ECs) and the concentrations of 5-HT in colon of SERT KO rats were higher than those of WT rats. Finally, increased expression levels of 5-HT1B receptors, 5-HT2C receptors, 5-HT3A receptors, 5-HT3B receptors, 5-HT6 receptors, 5-HT7 receptors, and glycosylated dopamine transporters (DATs) were found in the female SERT KO rats. We concluded that alterations in the serotonin system induced by the knockout of slc6a4 might result in VH and accelerated gastrointestinal motility in female SERT KO rats, which can be used as an animal model of IBS."
https://openalex.org/W3172581957,"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become the main cause of mortality in China. In 2009, the Chinese government introduced the Basic Public Health Service (BPHS) program to relieve the rising burden of NCDs through public health measures and delivery of essential medical care. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the BPHS program on hypertension control.The China National Health Development Research Center (CNHDRC) undertook a Cross-sectional Health Service Interview Survey (CHSIS) of 62,097 people from primary healthcare reform pilot areas across 17 provinces from eastern, central, and western parts of China in 2014. The current study is based on responses to the CHSIS survey from 7,867 participants, who had been diagnosed with hypertension. Multi-variable mixed logit regression analysis was used to estimate the association between BPHS management and uncontrolled hypertension. In a follow-up analysis, generalized structural equation modelling (GSEM) was used to test for mediation of the BPHS program effect through patient compliance with medication.The estimated proportion of patients with uncontrolled hypertension was 30% lower (23.2% vs 31.5%) in those participants who were adequately managed under the BPHS program. Other predictors of hypertension control included compliance with medication, self-reported wellbeing, income, educational attainment and exercise; smoking was associated with reduced hypertension control. The significant inverse association between uncontrolled hypertension and age indicates poor outcomes for younger patients. Additional testing suggested that nearly 40% of the effect of BPHS management (95% CI: 28.2 to 51.7) could be mediated by improved compliance with medication; there was also an indication that the effect of management was 30% stronger in districts/counties with established digital information management systems (IMS).Hypertension control improved markedly following active management through the BPHS program. Some of that improvement could be explained by greater compliance with medication among program participants. This study also identified the need to tailor the BPHS program to the needs of younger patients to achieve higher levels of control in this population. Future investigations should explore ways in which existing healthcare management influences the success of the BPHS program."

There is a growing global interest in tackling this issue to mitigate or handle the waste generated and limit its repercussions, as one in eight people suffer from undernourishment worldwide. In the Arab world, where there is a high dependency on imports and limited potential of increasing local food production, addressing food loss and waste becomes substantial. Research has mainly been focused on household food waste generation, while data on post-consumer plate food waste in the foodservice sector remains scarce. In this study, managers from a representative sample of 222 restaurants located in Municipal Beirut, Lebanon, were surveyed about food waste generation. Plate food waste was measured to establish baseline information. Multiple Tobit regression analyses were performed to explore the determinants for plate food waste generation. Plate waste generation was also compared between Lebanese and non-Lebanese cuisine restaurants. Results revealed that 1,620 tons of plate food waste are generated per year in Beirut, equivalent to 0.15% of Lebanon's total organic waste. Furthermore, Lebanese cuisine restaurants serving Mediterranean Mezze were found to generate 34 kg of organic waste per day more than restaurants that serve international non-Lebanese cuisine. The type of cuisine, kind of service, and menu planning were significantly associated with post-consumer food waste generation. This study revealed an increasing concern towards the amount of plate waste generated in Beirut, and thereby further research is needed to create baseline information at the national level."
https://openalex.org/W3172476241,"SET and MYND domain protein 2 (SMYD2) is a lysine methyltransferase that mediates histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) and acts as a regulator of tumorgenesis and cystic growth. However, its role in renal fibrosis remains unknown. In this study, we found that SMYD2 was highly expressed in the murine kidney of renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction, and primarily located in interstitial fibroblasts and renal tubular epithelial cells. Pharmacological inhibition of SMYD2 with AZ505, a highly selective inhibitor of SMYD2, protected against renal fibrosis and inhibited activation/proliferation of renal interstitial fibroblasts and conversion of epithelial cells to a profibrotic phenotype in this model. In cultured renal interstitial fibroblasts, treatment with AZ505 or silencing of SMYD2 by specific siRNA also inhibited serum- or TGF-β1-induced activation and proliferation of renal interstitial fibroblasts. Mechanistic studies showed that SMYD2 inhibition reduced phosphorylation of several profibrotic signaling molecules, including Smad3, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, AKT, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 and nuclear factor-κB in both injured kidney and cultured renal fibroblasts. AZ505 was also effective in suppressing renal expression of Snail and Twist, two transcriptional factors that mediate renal partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis. Conversely, AZ505 treatment prevented downregulation of Smad7, a renoprotective factor in vivo and in vitro. These results indicate that SMYD2 plays a critical role in mediating conversion of epithelial cells to a profibrotic phenotype, renal fibroblast activation and renal fibrogenesis, and suggest that SMYD2 may be a potential target for the treatment of chronic fibrosis in kidney disease."

Volume scans of 12×12 mm square were obtained at the same time as the OCT angiographic (OCTA) scans (Plex Elite 9000 Swept-Source OCT®, Zeiss). High-quality en face images of the choroidal vasculature of the segmentation slab of one-half of the subfoveal choroidal thickness were created for the analyses. The 100 en face images were divided into 80 for training and 20 for validation. Thus, we divided it into five groups of 20 eyes each, trained the remaining 80 eyes in each group, and then calculated the correct answer rate for each group by validation with 20 eyes. The Neural Network Console (NNC) developed by Sony and the Keras-Tensorflow backend developed by Google were used as the software for the classification with 16 layers of convolutional neural networks. The active region of the heatmap based on the feature quantity extracted by DL was also evaluated as the percentages with gradient-weighted class activation mapping implemented in Keras.The mean accuracy rate of the validation was 95% for NNC and 88% for Keras. This difference was not significant (P >0.1). The mean active region in the heatmap image was 12.5% in CSC eyes which was significantly lower than the 79.8% in normal eyes (P<0.01).CSC can be automatically diagnosed by DL with high accuracy from en face images of the choroidal vasculature with different programs, convolutional layer structures, and small data sets. Heatmap analyses showed that the DL focused on the area occupied by the choroidal vessels and their uniformity. We conclude that DL can help in the diagnosis of CSC."

Prevalence was calculated based on data of the national statistical bureau. Disease activity was defined using the revised EULAR criteria. MRA depicted stenotic changes and aortic wall enhancement.A disease prevalence of 14.5/1.000.000 inhabitants and an incidence of 0.3/1.000.000 per year was calculated. Aortic wall enhancement was found in 10 patients while in clinical and serological remission. EULAR criteria missed 5 patients with disease activity with isolated elevations of ESR/CRP. Arterial stenosis did not change over time in 5 cases, it improved in 2 and increased in 7. At follow-up 16 patients were treated with tocilizumab, 11/16 in monotherapy, 5 patients were treatment-free, 25/27 stayed in remission.In addition to prevalence and incidence, our data show that MRA qualifies to detect subclinical disease activity, but, on the other hand, that EULAR criteria may miss disease activity in case of isolated elevation of ESR/CRP."
https://openalex.org/W3166171027,"Acid ceramidase (murine gene code: Asah1) (50 kDa) belongs to N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase family. This enzyme is located in the lysosome, which mediates conversion of ceramide (CER) into sphingosine and free fatty acids at acidic pH. CER plays an important role in intracellular sphingolipid metabolism and its increase causes inflammation. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling on late endosomes (LEs)/lysosomes may control cargo selection, membrane biogenesis, and exosome secretion, which may be fine controlled by lysosomal sphingolipids such as CER. This lysosomal-CER-mTOR signaling may be a crucial molecular mechanism responsible for development of arterial medial calcification (AMC). Torin-1 (5 mg/kg/day), an mTOR inhibitor, significantly decreased aortic medial calcification accompanied with decreased expression of osteogenic markers like osteopontin (OSP) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and upregulation of smooth muscle 22α (SM22-α) in mice receiving high dose of Vitamin D (500 000 IU/kg/day). Asah1fl/fl/SMCre mice had markedly increased co-localization of mTORC1 with lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (Lamp-1) (lysosome marker) and decreased co-localization of vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 16 (VPS16) (a multivesicular bodies [MVBs] marker) with Lamp-1, suggesting mTOR activation caused reduced MVBs interaction with lysosomes. Torin-1 significantly reduced the co-localization of mTOR vs Lamp-1, increased lysosome–MVB interaction which was associated with reduced accumulation of CD63 and annexin 2 (exosome markers) in the coronary arterial wall of mice. Using coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs), Pi-stimulation significantly increased p-mTOR expression in Asah1fl/fl/SMCre CASMCs as compared to WT/WT cells associated with increased calcium deposition and mineralization. Torin-1 blocked Pi-induced calcium deposition and mineralization. siRNA mTOR and Torin-1 significantly reduce co-localization of mTORC1 with Lamp-1, increased VPS16 vs Lamp-1 co-localization in Pi-stimulated CASMCs, associated with decreased exosome release. Functionally, Torin-1 significantly reduces arterial stiffening as shown by restoration from increased pulse wave velocity and decreased elastin breaks.

Although growing COVID-19 case numbers, deaths, and hospitalizations are concerning, this spread is particularly alarming in the United States where polarizing opinions, changing policies, and misinformation abound. In particular, American college campuses have been a venue of rampant transmission, with concerning spillover into surrounding, more vulnerable, communities. We surveyed over 600 college students from across the United States and modeled predictors of compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions. We identified concern with severity, constitutionalism, news exposure, and religiosity as significant positive correlates with compliance, and general trust in science as a significant negative correlate. To determine how applicable nationwide modeling might be to individual local campuses we also administered this same survey to nearly 600 students at two large universities in Utah County. In this population, concern with severity was the only significant positive correlate with compliance; Additionally, feelings of inconvenience were negatively correlated. The effects of feelings of inconvenience, and news exposure were significantly different between populations. These results suggest that we should focus our efforts on increasing knowledge about the pandemic's effects on our society and informing about constitutionality amongst college students. However, we also show that nationwide surveys and modeling are informative, but if campuses are to efficiently curb the spread of COVID-19 this coming semester, they would be best served to utilize data collected from their student populations as these might significantly differ from general consensus data."
https://openalex.org/W3166972962,"Video games have become a ubiquitous part of demographically diverse cultures. Numerous studies have focused on analyzing the cognitive aspects involved in game playing that could help in providing an optimal gaming experience by improving video game design. To this end, we present a framework for classifying the game player's expertise level using wearable electroencephalography (EEG) headset. We hypothesize that expert and novice players' brain activity is different, which can be classified using frequency domain features extracted from EEG signals of the game player. A systematic channel reduction approach is presented using a correlation-based attribute evaluation method. This approach lead us in identifying two significant EEG channels, i.e., AF3 and P7, among fourteen channels available in Emotiv EPOC headset. In particular, features extracted from these two EEG channels contributed the most to the video game player's expertise level classification. This finding is validated by performing statistical analysis (t-test) over the extracted features. Moreover, among multiple classifiers used, K-nearest neighbor is the best classifier in classifying game player's expertise level with a classification accuracy of up to 98.04% (without data balancing) and 98.33% (with data balancing)."

https://openalex.org/W3169368565,"Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is an important cell cycle kinase and an attractive target for anticancer treatments. An ATP-competitive small molecular PLK1 inhibitor, volasertib, has reached phase III in clinical trials in patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia as a combination treatment with cytarabine. However, severe side effects limited its use. The origin of the side effects is unclear and might be due to insufficient specificity of the drug. Thus, identifying potential off-targets to volasertib is important for future clinical trials and for the development of more specific drugs. In this study, we used thermal proteome profiling (TPP) to identify proteome-wide targets of volasertib. Apart from PLK1 and proteins regulated by PLK1, we identified about 200 potential volasertib off-targets. Comparison of this result with the mass-spectrometry analysis of volasertib-treated cells showed that phosphatidylinositol phosphate and prostaglandin metabolism pathways are affected by volasertib. We confirmed that PIP4K2A and ZADH2—marker proteins for these pathways—are, indeed, stabilized by volasertib. PIP4K2A, however, was not affected by another PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib, suggesting that PIP4K2A is a true off-target of volasertib. Inhibition of these proteins is known to impact both the immune response and fatty acid metabolism and could explain some of the side effects seen in volasertib-treated patients."

https://openalex.org/W3172234640,"Relaxin is an insulin-like hormone with pleiotropic protective effects in several organs, including the liver. We aimed to characterize its role in the control of hepatic metabolism in healthy rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with human recombinant relaxin-2 for 2 weeks. The hepatic metabolic profile was analyzed using UHPLC-MS platforms. Hepatic gene expression of key enzymes of desaturation (Fads1/Fads2) of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) N-methyltransferase (Pemt), of fatty acid translocase Cd36, and of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Gpi) were quantified by Real Time-PCR. Activation of 5′AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was analyzed by Western Blot. Relaxin-2 significantly modified the hepatic levels of 19 glycerophospholipids, 2 saturated (SFA) and 1 monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids (FA), 3 diglycerides, 1 sphingomyelin, 2 aminoacids, 5 nucleosides, 2 nucleotides, 1 carboxylic acid, 1 redox electron carrier, and 1 vitamin. The most noteworthy changes corresponded to the substantially decreased lysoglycerophospholipids, and to the clearly increased FA (16:1n-7/16:0) and MUFA + PUFA/SFA ratios, suggesting enhanced desaturase activity. Hepatic gene expression of Fads1, Fads2, and Pemt, which mediates lipid balance and liver health, was increased by relaxin-2, while mRNA levels of the main regulator of hepatic FA uptake Cd36, and of the essential glycolysis enzyme Gpi, were decreased. Relaxin-2 augmented the hepatic activation of the hepatoprotector and master regulator of energy homeostasis AMPK. Relaxin-2 treatment also rised FADS1, FADS2, and PEMT gene expression in cultured Hep G2 cells. Our results bring to light the hepatic metabolic features stimulated by relaxin, a promising hepatoprotective molecule."

https://openalex.org/W3170480675,"Prior studies demonstrated that deletion of the protein phosphatase Phlpp1 in Ctsk-Cre expressing cells enhances bone mass, characterized by diminished osteoclast activity and increased coupling to bone formation. Due to non-specific expression of Ctsk-Cre, the definitive mechanism for this observation was unclear. To further define the role of bone resorbing osteoclasts, we performed ovariectomy (Ovx) and Sham surgeries on Phlpp1 cKO Ctsk and WT mice. Micro-CT analyses confirmed enhanced bone mass of Phlpp1 cKO Ctsk Sham females. In contrast, Ovx induced bone loss in both groups, with no difference between Phlpp1 cKO Ctsk and WT mice. Histomorphometry demonstrated that Ovx mice lacked differences in osteoclasts per bone surface, suggesting that estradiol (E2) is required for Phlpp1 deficiency to have an effect. We performed high throughput unbiased transcriptional profiling of Phlpp1 cKO Ctsk osteoclasts and identified 290 differentially expressed genes. By cross-referencing these differentially expressed genes with all estrogen response element (ERE) containing genes, we identified IGFBP4 as potential estrogen-dependent target of Phlpp1. E2 induced PHLPP1 expression, but reduced IGFBP4 levels. Moreover, genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of Phlpp1 was correlated with IGFBP4 levels. We then assessed IGFBP4 expression by osteoclasts in vivo within intact 12-week-old females. Modest IGFBP4 immunohistochemical staining of TRAP + osteoclasts within WT females was observed. In contrast, TRAP + bone lining cells within intact Phlpp1 cKO Ctsk females robustly expressed IGFBP4, but levels were diminished within TRAP + bone lining cells following Ovx. These results demonstrate that effects of Phlpp1 conditional deficiency are lost following Ovx, potentially due to estrogen-dependent regulation of IGFBP4."
https://openalex.org/W3177340484,"The objectives of this paper are to 1) construct a new network model compatible with distributed computation, 2) construct the full optimal power flow (OPF) in a distributed fashion so that an effective, non-inferior solution can be found, and 3) develop a scalable algorithm that guarantees the convergence to a local minimum.Due to the nonconvexity of the problem, the search for a solution to OPF problems is not scalable, which makes the OPF highly limited for the system operation of large-scale real-world power grids-""the curse of dimensionality"". The recent attempts at distributed computation aim for a scalable and efficient algorithm by reducing the computational cost per iteration in exchange of increased communication costs.A new network model allows for efficient computation without increasing communication costs. With the network model, recent advancements in distributed computation make it possible to develop an efficient and scalable algorithm suitable for large-scale OPF optimizations.We propose a new network model in which all nodes are directly connected to the center node to keep the communication costs manageable. Based on the network model, we suggest a nodal distributed algorithm and direct communication to all nodes through the center node. We demonstrate that the suggested algorithm converges to a local minimum rather than a point, satisfying the first optimality condition.The proposed algorithm identifies solutions to OPF problems in various IEEE model systems. The solutions are identical to those using a centrally optimized and heuristic approach. The computation time at each node does not depend on the system size, and Niter does not increase significantly with the system size.Our proposed network model is a star network for maintaining the shortest node-to-node distances to allow a linear information exchange. The proposed algorithm guarantees the convergence to a local minimum rather than a maximum or a saddle point, and it maintains computational efficiency for a large-scale OPF, scalable algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W3167842035,"It started with an attempt at humor during a team meeting in April. Brandon, the principal investigator (PI), expressed gratitude for the work of a team member, Chris, then bemoaned the big shoes that would be left to fill if Chris was hit by a bus. Not long before, a friend and colleague had died suddenly, and we had seen the people who worked most closely with him worry and wonder, in the midst of their grief, who would continue the research, advise the graduate students, track down the data files, and lead the national coordinating center. We had both taken steps toward personal end-of-life planning since the onset of the pandemic, and we realized it could be relevant to our work lives, too. But it wasn't until our team meeting that the reality really hit home. “As the PI, I have details and documents no one else has access to,” Brandon realized. “What happens if I get hit by a bus?”"
https://openalex.org/W3172697598,"The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) virtual Catalyst Conference on Imaging Cells to Organisms for Basic Science and Medical Research was held on April 14, 2021, using the Zoom platform (Zoom Video Communications, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). This FASEB Catalyst Conference was part of the African Seminar Series launched by the Sena Institute of Technology (SIT; Penyi, Ghana) on February 17, 2021, to bring researchers across the African Continent together and expand their access to conferences. The inaugural African Seminar Series presentation was given by Dr. Tom Broker (Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA) on “Early electron microscopic studies of DNA structures, genome organization, and gene expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.” This was followed by Dr. Andrew Seeber (Center for Advanced Imaging, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA) on March 17, with a presentation on “Chromatin mobility and precision genome engineering.” And most recently, on May 19, Dr. Gisele Miranda (Chan-Zuckerberg Imaging Scientist, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden) presented on “Image analysis using open software.” A key objective of the series is to promote collaborations between African researchers and scientists globally in the basic sciences and medical research. Through the African Seminar Series, we intend to empower young researchers returning to the continent to continue to work in the basic sciences, ensure that a strong basic science foundation will support the current translational research, and provide educational resources to support ongoing research across the continent. This platform will also provide a collaborative environment for researchers across the African Continent on cutting edge research on using microscopy and image analysis to address pertinent molecular biology issues, encourage students to adopt science, math, and computational skills, and promote innovation and technology development through hands-on experiential approaches. Importantly, the platform enables us to highlight local talents within Africa who engage in and foster basic and medical research on the continent and globally through collaborations. For many researchers in Africa, access to research support infrastructure impedes the quality and pace of research work. A key component of such infrastructure is the availability of subject-specific conferences within the continent. Unfortunately, existing conference series are inaccessible to African researchers due to the high cost of transportation, visa issues, and limited research funding mechanisms to support conference attendance in person. These issues demand that efforts must be put in place to host some of these conferences within the continent to boost local participation. For example, FASEB conferences have been hosted on major continents except Africa, and this is true for many other organizations, as well. To bridge the scientific gap between African institutions and their counterparts elsewhere, we need to promote more basic research conferences within the continent to introduce cutting-edge research to investigators on the continent. We are delighted that FASEB will be hosting its first in-person conference in Ghana in 2023 through partnership with SIT. Our first step toward improving global science equity is the joint SIT–FASEB virtual conference hosted in April despite the pandemic. The Catalyst Conference featured a keynote speaker and four other invited experts, including two African scientists. One faculty member resides in Ghana, Africa, and another researcher has dual professional affiliations in Switzerland and Egypt. This conference is the first FASEB conference with the highest fraction of African participants. A total of 142 people registered for the conference, with 33% participants located in the United States, 42% from African countries, and 25% globally distributed. Of the registered participants, 85 people attended, with 52% of the participants located in the United States, 31% in Africa, and 17% from elsewhere around the world. The aims of the conference were to promote research capacity on the African Continent through seminars and conferences, drive greater interest in basic, and develop collaborations among researchers across the globe. For many conferences, African institutions are underrepresented in terms of attendance and speaker lists. Through the African Seminar Series, we were able to engage African researchers within and outside the continent and highlight their work at the conference. Overall, this was a great success. This initial virtual conference highlights the unmet need of basic science conferences for African researchers, and we look forward to the in-person conference in Ghana, 2023. The keynote presentation was given by Dr. Cassandra Extavour (Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University). Her talk was entitled “Combining quantitative imaging and mathematical modeling to understand nuclear movements in early embryos.” Beginning with the evolution of embryos and their impact for developmental biology, she described how imaging and quantitative imaging has provided great insight into evolution of embryogenesis, how these features are formed through cytoplasmic flows, and what causes nuclear expansion (cell division, nuclear speed, and direction). She contrasted early embryo development between the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus and factors leading to blastoderm formation. This presentation received an enthusiastic review, as people were happy that the research was done with non-standard model organisms and liked its application to extracellular matrices. The first speaker of the day was Dr. Kim McKim (Professor of Genetics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). The title of his talk was “How chromosomes direct their own segregation in Drosophila oocytes.” He discussed chromosome segregation in Drosophila oocytes during meiosis. During his presentation, he showed spindle assembly using chromatin and spindle targeting of the chromosomal passenger complexes (CPCs), rescue of spindle loss with Borealin, and the role of heterochromatin protein-1 in Aurora B and CPC function. He also introduced genetic tools in Drosophila available for studying these processes, including site-specific mutagenesis, tissue-specific gene expression and RNA interference (RNAi), and confocal imaging. The presentation by Dr. Haitham Shaban (Marie Curie Research Fellow, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, and National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt) was entitled “Live superresolution of chromatin structure and dynamics.” Through his efforts with a laboratory at the National Research Centre in Egypt and a fellowship at EPFL in Switzerland, he can develop novel technologies outside Egypt while also working with teams in Egypt to empower local knowledge and capacity development. He described the various approaches to study genome organization, including X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and light microscopy. A major component of his talk focused on time-resolved superresolution imaging of chromatin in living cells using his developed deep–photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) technique. Further, he presented optical flow technologies, such as high-resolution diffusion mapping (Hi-D) and dense flow reconstruction and correlation (DFCC) for studying the global genome dynamics. Dr. Vincent Armah (Lecturer, Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana) presented on the “Dynamics of RecA-mediated repair of replication-dependent DNA damage.” He recently completed his doctoral studies in the United Kingdom and returned to Ghana. Using Eschericia coli as a model organism, he showed how a palindrome-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) is repaired using live cell imaging. He postulated the role of replication in the rapid repair of spontaneous DSBs. The final speaker was Dr. Douglas Richardson (Director, Harvard Center of Biological Imaging, Harvard University) who presented on “Clarifying tissue clearing” of biological samples for light microscopic imaging. Tissue imaging has its challenges, and an ill-prepared sample can pose a significant barrier to tissue and whole-organ imaging. We specifically invited him to discuss issues such as refractive index mismatch, lipid removal, and tissue integrity during tissue preparation for imaging. His presentation emphasized factors resulting in light scatter and the relevance of tissue clearing for quality image acquisition. He also provided insights on choosing the appropriate objective lenses to match the sample. He concluded with a compelling example of imaging the mouse retinal vasculature. Twenty-three participants responded to the postconference survey; 80% indicated the topics discussed were relevant, and 100% appreciated the high quality of the presentations; 60% of respondents indicated that the presentation would impact their own work. Attendees also felt that the time allocation was sufficient and the presentations were unrushed. Direct constructive feedback received from the audience included requests for more presentations from African scientists and inclusion of additional translational topics. There was also interest in more lectures on basic science, mathematical modeling, and imaging of whole organisms. All respondents were interested in attending the conference again, either in person or virtually. This inaugural event thus introduces and promotes the in-person conference scheduled for Accra, Ghana, in 2023, with the goal of making it attractive, affordable, and accessible to researchers within the African Continent.
