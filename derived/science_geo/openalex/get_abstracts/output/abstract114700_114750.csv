https://openalex.org/W1571379445,"By in vitro transcription/translation of model proteins in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes, we have measured the minimum distance of an acceptor site from the lumenal end of a transmembrane segment required for N-linked glycosylation, both when the acceptor site is placed N- and C-terminally to the membrane anchor. We observe a sharp threshold at a distance of 12-14 residues, suggesting that the oligosaccharyltransferase active site is 30-40 A above the membrane and is oriented roughly parallel to the membrane surface."
https://openalex.org/W1630763432,"The products of the shc gene appear to be substrates for activated oncogenic tyrosine kinases, such as v-Src and v-Fps and activated tyrosine kinase receptors like the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors. We investigated whether the Shc proteins are targets for the activated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. Here we show that the 46- and 52-kDa Shc proteins are rapidly phosphorylated upon insulin receptor activation in fibroblasts expressing elevated levels of human insulin receptors. Furthermore, we observed insulin-induced association of a 23-kDa protein with the Shc proteins. These effects on Shc proteins are similar to those observed after EGF and PDGF treatment. In contrast to the observed Shc-EGF receptor association, we did not detect association between the Shc proteins and the insulin receptor. We conclude that the Shc proteins are common elements in a signal transduction pathway that is shared by EGF, PDGF, and insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1502038901,"The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis. Glucocorticoids enhance PEPCK gene expression through a multicomponent regulatory complex. We show that a full response to glucocorticoids requires two DNA segments: 1) a glucocorticoid response unit (GRU), centered at about position -400, which contains two accessory factor elements (AF1 and AF2) and two glucocorticoid receptor binding sites (GR1 and GR2), and 2) a basal promoter/cyclic AMP response element (E/CRE) at about position -90, which binds the transcription factor CREB. A protein-protein interaction was observed in vitro between GR and CREB that might account for the role of the E/CRE in the glucocorticoid response of the PEPCK gene."
https://openalex.org/W1598643430,"Abstract We report the isolation and characterization of a full-length cDNA encoding rat liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I). Oligonucleotides corresponding to two tryptic peptides derived from the malonyl-CoA/etomoxir-CoA-binding protein of rat liver mitochondria (Esser, V., Kuwajima, M., Britton, C. H., Krishnan, K., Foster, D. W., and McGarry, J. D. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 5810-5816) were used to screen a rat liver cDNA library constructed in the plasmid cloning vector, pcDV. The clone obtained consisted of a 102-nucleotide 5'-untranslated region, a single open reading frame of 2,319 bases predicting a protein of 773 amino acids (M(r) = 88,150), and a 3'-untranslated segment of 1,957 nucleotides followed by the poly(A)+ tail. A 0.9-kilobase fragment of the cDNA recognized a single species of mRNA (approximately 4.7 kilobases in size) in rat liver. The identity of the cDNA was confirmed by the findings that (i) the open reading frame encoded all four peptides found in the original protein; (ii) transfection of COS cells with the cDNA subcloned into the expression vector, pCMV6, resulted in a selective and 10-20-fold induction of a malonyl-CoA- and etomoxir-CoA-sensitive CPT activity; and (iii) the overexpressed product was readily detected on Western blots by an antibody raised against the starting material. It seems likely that the de novo synthesized enzyme is targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane via a leader peptide and that the mature protein achieves membrane anchoring through a stretch of 20 amino acids present near its amino terminus. The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein shows regions of strong identity with those of three other rat acyltransferases, namely, liver CPT II, liver carnitine octanoyltransferase, and brain choline acetyltransferase. The findings provide the first insight into the structure of a CPT I isoform. They also establish unequivocally that CPT I and CPT II are distinct proteins and that inhibitors of CPT I interact within its catalytic domain, not with an associated regulatory component."
https://openalex.org/W1591990543,"We examined the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on alpha 1(I) procollagen mRNA levels, alpha 1(I) collagen gene transcription, and alpha 1(I) collagen promoter activity in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Cells were stably transfected with ColCAT 3.6, containing 3521 base pairs of alpha 1(I) collagen promoter DNA, fused to the CAT reporter gene, or an upstream deletion mutant of ColCAT 3.6 designated ColCAT 2.3. After 48 h, bFGF (0.1-10 nM) inhibited the incorporation of [3H]proline into collagenase-digestible protein (CDP). Indomethacin did not alter the inhibitory effect of bFGF on CDP labeling. Aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, did not block the inhibitory effect of bFGF on CDP. bFGF (1-10 nM) decreased alpha 1(I) procollagen mRNA levels, with maximal inhibition, nearly 99% of control, caused by 10 nM bFGF. After 48 h, bFGF (1 nM) reduced alpha 1(I) procollagen gene transcription by about 92%. ColCAT 3.6 activity was inhibited with 0.1-10 nM bFGF and was maximally repressed by about 83% with 10 nM bFGF. In contrast, bFGF (1 and 10 nM) caused a stimulation of ColCAT 2.3 activity. These data show that bFGF inhibits collagen synthesis by a transcriptional mechanism and the alpha 1(I) collagen promoter contains DNA sequences which mediate bFGF inhibition of type I collagen gene expression in bone."
https://openalex.org/W1544616947,"TIS10/PGS-2 encodes a prostaglandin synthase (PGS) distinct from the previously described enzyme PGS-1 (EC 1.14.99.1). We have now generated antipeptide antisera, directed to an amino acid sequence unique to the murine TIS10/PGS-2 protein, which specifically recognize the TIS10/PGS-2 antigen. TIS10/PGS-2 protein was undetectable in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells. The level of TIS10/PGS-2 protein peaked between 6 and 8 h following phorbol ester stimulation of cells, then declined to basal levels after 18-24 h. Synthesis of TIS10/PGS-2 protein was dramatically increased in the second hour following mitogen stimulation and remained elevated for several hours. The half-life of the TIS10/PGS-2 protein was 4 h. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated a perinuclear and cytoplasmic localization of the TIS10/PGS-2 antigen. As expected, detection of induced TIS10/PGS-2 antigen was dependent on protein synthesis. Metabolically labeled TIS10/PGS-2 protein migrated as a 71/73-kDa doublet following immunoprecipitation. Dexamethasone blocked both the TPA- and serum-induced appearance of TIS10/PGS-2 antigen. These studies demonstrate the existence of a mitogen-inducible, glucocorticoid-inhibitable, immunologically distinct prostaglandin synthase protein."
https://openalex.org/W1659182807,"The prohormone convertases PC1 (also known as PC3) and PC2 have been implicated in the biosynthesis of several polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides. In order to understand the regulation and the cell biology of prohormone cleavage, we have purified recombinant mouse PC1 from the conditioned medium of overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. Recombinant PC1 was found to be an 87-kDa calcium-dependent proteinase with an inhibitor profile similar to that of Kex2 and furin. However, unlike furin, the optimum pH for PC1 activity is between pH 5.5 and 6.5. Like furin, the enzyme is activated at millimolar rather than at micromolar concentrations of calcium. Chinese hamster ovary/PC1 cells secrete the mature form of PC1, converted by a proteolytic cleavage on the carboxyl side of the RSKR motif located at residues 80-83. This conversion occurs very early in biosynthesis, suggesting that, like Kex2 and furin, PC1 may be activated autocatalytically. Specificity studies with fluorogenic substrates showed that the enzyme prefers substrates with an arginine 4 amino acids amino-terminal to the cleavage site; synthetic tripeptide substrates containing only pairs of basic amino acids are not well cleaved. However, the neuropeptide precursor proenkephalin is cleaved by PC1 to yield a peptide B-sized peptide; since peptide B represents the naturally occurring carboxyl-terminal fragment of proenkephalin, these data suggest a role for PC1 in the processing of this precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1588418288,"The structure of over 93% of the sugar chains of serum transferrin purified from three patients with carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein (CDG) syndrome was Neu5Ac alpha 2-->6Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc beta 1-->2Man alpha 1-->6 (Neu5Ac alpha 2-->6Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc beta 1-->2Man alpha 1-->3)Man beta 1-->4GlcNac beta 1-->4GlcNAc, similar to that in a healthy control. On chromatofocusing, CDG syndrome transferrin was separated into three major isoforms, S4, S2, and S0, containing 4, 2, and 0 sialic acids/molecule at pH 5.12 (5.16), 5.42, and 5.80, respectively. On 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the molecular masses of transferrin isoforms S4, S2, and S0 were 80, 77, and 74 kDa, respectively. Transferrin isoforms S4 and S2 were linked to 2 and 1 mol of sialylated biantennary sugar chain/transferrin molecule, on the other hand, isoform S0 was not linked to any asparagine-N-linked oligosaccharide. Accordingly, CDG syndrome can be concluded to be an asparagine-N-linked oligosaccharide transfer deficiency, although the primary deficient enzyme has not yet been determined."
https://openalex.org/W1575835136,"8-Cl-cAMP, a site-selective cAMP analog, induces growth inhibition in a variety of cell types of human cancer cell lines. This inhibitory effect of 8-Cl-cAMP was related to its ability to differentially regulate type I versus type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In the present study we demonstrated a unique mechanism of action of 8-Cl-cAMP in the regulation of these kinase isozymes in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) resolved various isoforms of protein kinase present in HL-60 cells. In control cells, type I protein kinase (PKI) comprised more than 90% and type II protein kinase (PKII) less than 10% of the total cAMP-stimulated kinase activity. Treatment with 8-Cl-cAMP (5 microM, 72 h) decreased PKI to a level below 30% of that in untreated control cells and markedly increased PKII composed of three peaks. Photoaffinity labeling/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of column fractions identified the molecular species of regulatory (R) subunits present in protein kinases. Control cells contained high levels of the 48-kDa protein (RI) that composed PKI and low levels of the 50-kDa RII associated with PKII. 8-Cl-cAMP treatment brought about a decrease in the 48-kDa RI along with an increased formation of the truncated 34-kDa RI associated with PKI and an increase in the 50-54-kDa species of RII associated with PKII. A similar protein kinase profile as that shown by 8-Cl-cAMP treatment was observed in cells infected with the human RII beta retroviral vector: the 48-kDa RI of PKI decreased and the 52- and 54-kDa RII associated with PKII increased as compared with uninfected control cells. However, unlike 8-Cl-cAMP treatment, RII beta retroviral vector infection brought about no increase in the 34-kDa-truncated RI but exhibited an increase in the free 48-kDa RI subunit. As the 48-kDa RI and the 50-kDa RII were present in control cells, the enhanced expression of the 52- and 54-kDa RII proteins was due to overexpression of the RII beta gene. We identified the 48-kDa RI as RI alpha, the 50-kDa RII as RII alpha, the 52-kDa RII as RII beta, and the 54-kDa RII as the phosphorylated form of either the RII alpha or RII beta subunit. In vivo labeling experiments using [3H]8-Cl-cAMP demonstrated that 8-Cl-cAMP enters cells and binds to both PKI and PKII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1593314637,"The mechanism of action of two forms of the prolactin (PRL) receptor was studied using analogs of human growth hormone (hGH). At low concentrations (approximately 1 pM), hGH binds and stimulates proliferation of Nb2 cells containing the 391-residue PRL receptor as well as murine lymphoid FDC-P1 cells transfected with the 591-residue hPRL receptor. However, at high concentrations (approximately 70 microM) hGH inhibits proliferation of both these cell lines. Such a bell-shaped hormone response curve was observed for hGH stimulation of the hGH receptor (Fuh, G., Cunningham, B.C., Fukunaga, R., Nagata, S., Goeddel, D. V., and Wells, J.A. (1992) Science 256, 1677-1680) and is consistent with the sequential formation of an active hormone-(receptor)2 complex in which hGH binds through a first site (Site 1) to a first receptor and then through a second site (Site 2) to a second receptor. By analogy to hGH activation of the hGH receptor, we find that hGH variants that are mutated in Site 1 or Site 2 are greatly reduced as agonists. Similarly, only Site 2 mutants are potent antagonists of either hGH or hPRL stimulated cell proliferation. These and other data support the notion that hGH and hPRL activate the PRL receptor by sequential dimerization and provide a rational basis for the design of potent antagonists to the prolactin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1557881499,"The p46 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4F purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate has previously been found to be composed of eIF-4AI and eIF-4AII in a 4:1 ratio, respectively, whereas the free form of rabbit eIF-4A is composed solely of eIF-4AI. Using sucrose gradient centrifugation and an m7GTP-Sepharose 4B assay, it was shown that eIF-4A exchanges with the p46 subunit of eIF-4F. Incubation of [14C]eIF-4A and eIF-4F resulted in the incorporation of [14C] eIF-4A into the eIF-4F complex. Conversely, the [14C] p46 subunit of [14C]eIF-4F was shown to dissociate from the [14C]eIF-4F complex in the presence of eIF-4A, presumably due to the incorporation of unlabeled eIF-4A. Similar experiments were conducted in which 14C-labeled initiation factors were incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate. When [14C]eIF-4A was incubated with lysate, [14C]eIF-4A became incorporated into the eIF-4F complex present in the lysate. Additionally, when [14C]eIF-4F was incubated with lysate, the [14C]p46 subunit of [14C]eIF-4F dissociated from the [14C]eIF-4F complex, most likely due to the exchange of unlabeled eIF-4A (present in the lysate) with the [14C]p46 subunit. The exchange of mouse eIF-4AI and eIF-4AII expressed in Escherichia coli was also investigated in the presence of eIF-4F and rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Both the sucrose gradient experiments and m7GTP-Sepharose 4B assays demonstrated that the [14C]p46 subunit of [14C]eIF-4F was displaced in the presence of eIF-4AI or eIF-4AII and that mouse [14C]eIF-4AI or [14C]eIF-4AII became incorporated into the eIF-4F complex in the same manner as rabbit reticulocyte eIF-4A."
https://openalex.org/W1590950559,"The replication origin of Escherichia coli (oriC) was probed for specific binding proteins, using the gel shift assay. A 33-kDa protein that binds specifically to the right border of oriC, next to the rightmost of the binding sites of the initiator protein, DnaA, was identified and purified. The stoichiometry of protein to DNA is about 6 to 1. Around 5000 monomers of the protein, named Rob (right oriC binding), are present per cell. The rob gene has been located near 99.8 min on the E. coli map, cloned, and overexpressed. The total protein sequence reveals strong homologies to several regulatory proteins with which it shares the helix-turn-helix motif."
https://openalex.org/W1579290321,"Mitogenesis induced by most polypeptide growth factors is mediated by either G-protein- or tyrosine kinase-linked receptor pathways. Thrombin, a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells, activates a G-protein-coupled receptor but also requires tyrosine kinase activity for its mitogenic effect (Weiss, R. H., and Nuccitelli, R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 5608-5613). Since this growth factor elicits a synergistic effect on DNA synthesis when applied to cells concurrently with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), we suspected that the two growth factors have points of convergence in their signaling pathways. We now show that when 1 unit/ml thrombin is removed after an incubation period of from 4 h to 15 min prior to 15 ng/ml bFGF addition, its synergistic effect with bFGF on mitogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells is preserved. Furthermore, appearance of bFGF in the cellular lysate is maximal 1 h after the addition of 1 unit/ml thrombin. While monoclonal antibody to bFGF inhibits thrombin's mitogenic effect by 63% at 30 micrograms/ml, it lacks an inhibitory effect on platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced mitogenesis. The inhibitory effect of bFGF antibody on thrombin's growth is completely reversed by the addition of bFGF. These data demonstrate that the presence of bFGF is essential for thrombin to exert its full mitogenic effect in vascular smooth muscle cells, providing an example of a system where a tyrosine kinase-linked growth factor receptor system can act as an essential intermediary in the mitogenic signaling pathway of a G-protein-coupled receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1574703815,"The extracytoplasmic region of the bovine cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF-II receptor) consists of 15 homologous repeating domains, each of which is approximately 147 residues in length. The receptor contains two high affinity mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) binding sites and our recent studies (Westlund, B., Dahms, N. M., and Kornfeld, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 23233-23239) have localized these two binding sites to domains 1-3 and 7-11. To further define the location of the Man-6-P binding sites and to determine the role of specific arginine residues in Man-6-P binding, site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to create truncated soluble forms of the M6P/IGF-II receptor in conjunction with either conservative (Lys) or nonconservative (Ala) replacement of arginine residues. These mutants were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells and assayed for their ability to bind phosphomannosyl residues by affinity chromatography. Analysis of the ligand binding activity of carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of the receptor's extracytoplasmic region demonstrated that the second Man-6-P binding site is contained within domains 7-9. Substitution of Arg435 in domain 3 of the amino-terminal binding site and Arg1334 in domain 9 of the second binding site results in a dramatic loss of ligand binding activity. However, substitutions at positions 435 and/or 1334 did not affect the secretion, glycosylation, or immunoreactivity of these truncated proteins. Taken together, these results indicate that Arg435 and Arg1334 are essential components of the M6P/IGF-II receptor's high affinity Man-6-P binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1562129804,"Soluble extracts from the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata were found to inhibit collagen-, ADP-, and thrombin-stimulated platelet aggregation. One inhibitory component was purified to homogeneity by a combination of gel filtration, ion-exchange, and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The purified activity, named moubatin, is a protein of molecular weight 17,000 and it inhibits the aggregation of washed human platelets stimulated by collagen with an IC50 of approximately 50 nM in the standard assay. At a concentration of moubatin that maximally inhibited collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation, no inhibition of aggregation initiated by other effectors, including arachidonic acid, thrombin, ristocetin, and the calcium ionophore A23187, was observed. Moubatin also inhibits collagen-dependent aggregation in plasma. At a higher concentration of moubatin (> 1 microM) it was also possible to demonstrate an inhibitory effect on the final extent of aggregation induced by a low concentration of ADP. Although moubatin selectively inhibits platelet activation by collagen, it has only a minimal effect on the adhesion of platelets to collagen. The amino acid sequences of peptides derived from proteolytic cleavage of moubatin suggest that moubatin is a unique protein, consistent with its novel functional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1479858937,"The recently cloned fli-1 gene is a member of the ets oncogene family that is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells. It is a target of dysregulation by Friend leukemia virus insertion and translocation in Ewing's sarcoma and neuroepithelioma. In this report, we have studied the function and regulation of both murine and human fli-1. Analysis of the human and mouse fli-1 proteins showed that fli-1 binds to specific DNA sequences highly related to m-ets-2 binding sites. Methylation protection experiments showed that fli-1 and m-ets-2 contacted the same nucleotides in two different binding sites. The fli-1 protein was shown to be a transcriptional activator in co-transfection studies. Stimulation of murine bone marrow macrophages by mediators of inflammation, such as lipopolysaccharide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, interleukin-1, and interferon-gamma resulted in the reduced expression of fli-1 mRNA. fli-1 was only expressed in a defined subset of human erythroleukemia cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1587031678,"Multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) is a mediator of calcium signals in diverse signaling pathways. In human lymphocytes and epithelial tissues, CaM kinase activates a chloride channel via a Ca(2+)-dependent pathway which is preserved in cystic fibrosis. To characterize the CaM kinase present in these tissues we have cloned an isoform of this kinase from human T lymphocytes. We show the cDNA structure of two variants of this human CaM kinase, gamma B and gamma C, which are predicted to translate to 518 and 495 amino acids, respectively. Amino acid differences between these isoforms and the rat brain gamma isoform (which we refer to as gamma A) are localized to the variable domain. We used RNase protection of this variable region to reveal the level of expression of gamma B and gamma C CaM kinase mRNAs in nine human tissues and cell lines. When transfected into Jurkat T cells, the gamma B cDNA encoded a functional kinase which cosedimented on sucrose gradients with endogenous T cell CaM kinase activity and formed a large multimeric enzyme. The recombinant gamma B isoform displayed two phases of autophosphorylation characteristic of CaM kinases, including the phase which converts it to a partially Ca(2+)-independent species. Site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted autoinhibitory domain yielded a mutant which was approximately 37% active in the absence of Ca2+/calmodulin, confirming the region as critical for autoregulation, and suggesting this mutant as a tool for studying the role of CaM kinase in nonneuronal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1546735466,"The nuclear-encoded, thylakoid-bound early light-inducible protein (ELIP) reported to be related to the initial stages of chloroplast differentiation is synthesized in substantial amounts in leaves of mature plants exposed to light stress conditions (Adamska, I., Ohad, I., and Kloppstech, K. (1992b) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 2610-2613). Increase in ELIP content correlates with the photoinactivation of PSII, degradation of D1 protein, and changes in the level of pigments. Inhibition of phytoene desaturase and/or zeta-carotene desaturase during light stress drastically increases accumulation of the protein. ELIP mRNA is short-lived (t1/2 = 1 h). The thylakoid bound protein is stable in high light exposed leaves and is degraded only during recovery from light stress at low light intensity (40 microE/m2s). The lifetime of the protein during the recovery process increases with the extent of initial light stress condition. We propose that ELIP synthesis and degradation is related to the process of the plant response to light stress and recovery from photoinhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1559916774,"PC12 cells respond to nerve growth factor by differentiating into sympathetic neuron-like cells that employ the integrin alpha 1 beta 1 to attach to, and extend neurites on, substrata coated with collagen or laminin. In one PC12 subline, PC12i, prolonged treatment with nerve growth factor results in a marked increase in synthesis of alpha 1 subunits and in the level of alpha 1 mRNA, with a corresponding increase in alpha 1 beta 1 expressed on the cell surface. These changes are accompanied by substantial increases in initial cell attachment to collagen and in the fraction of neurite-bearing cells and average neurite length. Integrin beta 1-subunits are constitutively expressed, so that alpha 1 synthesis controls the amount of alpha 1 beta 1 heterodimer expressed on PC12i cells. Acidic fibroblast growth factor also induces alpha 1 beta 1 in PC12i cells, with consequent enhancement of neurite outgrowth; treatment with epidermal growth factor or dibutyryl cyclic AMP does not have these effects. Another subline, PC12c, expresses high levels of alpha 1 mRNA and alpha 1 protein constitutively. With or without nerve growth factor pretreatment, these cells adhere well to collagen and a majority extend neurites when replated in the presence of nerve growth factor. Dexamethasone treatment of PC12c cells reduces expression of alpha 1 mRNA and alpha 1 protein, with consequent reduction in attachment to collagen. In both sublines, then, there is a direct relationship between the level of a specific matrix receptor and cell-matrix adhesion. Moreover, our results suggest that induced expression of this matrix receptor is an essential aspect of the regulation of neurite extension by nerve growth factor in PC12i cells."
https://openalex.org/W1565125984,"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes (m1-m5) differentially regulate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase (PLC) through the activation of distinct guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins which can be distinguished on the basis of their sensitivity to inhibition by pertussis toxin (PTX). In transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, the m2 receptor subtype regulates the stimulation of PLC and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) through PTX-sensitive G proteins. In this study, we utilized the ability of cholera toxin (CTX) to ADP-ribosylate PTX-sensitive alpha subunits as part of the ternary complex formed by heterotrimeric G proteins and agonist-bound receptors to detect and characterize the interactions between transfected m2 receptors and endogenous G proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In membranes derived from cells expressing the m2, but not the m3 receptor, the cholinergic agonist carbachol stimulated CTX modification of a 40-kDa species (G alpha 40). Importantly, similar carbachol dose dependence values and PTX dose sensitivities were observed for m2 receptor-mediated PLC signaling and G alpha 40-CTX modification. High resolution urea-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that G alpha i2 (40 kDa) and G alpha i3 (41 kDa) were components of the G alpha 40 identified by m2 receptor-dependent CTX modification. Furthermore, the sensitivities of G alpha i2 and G alpha i3 to PTX modification were determined to be the same as those for PTX inhibition of G alpha 40 labeling by CTX and m2 receptor-mediated PLC signaling. Similarly, agonist-induced desensitization of m2 receptor-G protein signaling required doses of agonist associated with stimulation of PLC. Desensitization involved receptor sequestration and down-regulation of G alpha i3; however, only the reduction of G alpha i3 required prior activation PLC signaling. Finally, desensitization of m2-G protein coupling could be partially mimicked by treatment with thapsigargin, an inducer of intracellular Ca2+ release, without altering the number of cell surface receptors or G protein levels. These results demonstrate that m2 receptors couple to both G alpha i2 and G alpha i3 in vivo and that this interaction is integral to both positive and negative regulatory pathways leading to activation of PLC and desensitization of receptor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1562768493,"Moubatin, a new type of specific inhibitor of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, has been isolated from the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata (Waxman, L., and Connolly, T. M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 5445-5449). A polymerase chain reaction-generated hybridization probe, produced using primers based on moubatin protein sequence, identified phage containing the entire cDNA sequence of moubatin. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence yielded a mature protein of 156 amino acids with a putative prepeptide of 15 amino acids. Comparison of the sequence of moubatin to that of other proteins in the Swiss PROT data base revealed no significant homology. The cDNA sequence was cloned into the yeast expression vector pKH4 alpha 2, producing a biologically active protein which inhibited collagen-stimulated aggregation of washed human platelets with an IC50 of about 100 nM, which is similar to the potency of native tick moubatin. A concentration of recombinant moubatin that fully inhibited collagen-stimulated aggregation did not inhibit aggregation induced by a variety of other platelet agonists, again demonstrating comparable properties of the recombinant and native proteins. Moubatin did not inhibit platelet adhesion to collagen even at a concentration up to 16 times its IC50 for the inhibition of aggregation. This specificity for inhibiting collagen-stimulated aggregation and not adhesion to collagen indicates that moubatin is unique among the natural product inhibitors of collagen stimulation of platelets. Further examination of the mechanism of moubatin-mediated inhibition of collagen-stimulated aggregation revealed that 1-6 microM moubatin diminished the second phase of aggregation induced by ADP, inhibited aggregation in response to submaximal concentrations of the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619, and competed for the binding of a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist to platelet membranes. Therefore, at higher concentrations, moubatin may affect more than one aspect of platelet signal transduction including the thromboxane A2 receptor. The availability of recombinant moubatin will allow further investigation of its unique activities in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1522892871,"A 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (EC 1.14.11.11) which catalyzes the hydroxylation at position 4 of the indole alkaloid, desacetoxyvindoline has been purified to near homogeneity from Catharanthus roseus. The purification procedure combined conventional chromatographic methods and cosubstrate affinity chromatography on alpha-ketoglutarate-Sepharose. The specific activity of the 4-hydroxylase was enriched over 2000-fold compared to the crude homogenate with a recovery of 1.6%. The molecular mass of the native and denatured 4-hydroxylase was found to be 45 and 44.7 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the native enzyme is a monomer. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing under denaturing conditions resolved the purified 4-hydroxylase into three charge isoforms of pI values 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8. The enzyme did not require most divalent cations, but inactive enzyme was reactivated in a time-dependent manner by incubation with ferrous ions. The mechanism of action of desacetoxyvindoline 4-hydroxylase was investigated. The results of substrate interaction kinetics and product inhibition studies suggest an Ordered Ter Ter mechanism where 2-oxoglutarate is the first substrate to bind followed by the binding of O2 and desacetoxyvindoline. The first product to be released was deacetylvindoline followed by CO2 and succinate, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1557084204,"This study examines the tissue specificity and the gene products arising from alternative mRNA processing of the mammalian acetylcholinesterase gene. By splicing either alternative exons 5 or 6 in the mouse and human genes directly to the invariant exons (exons 2, 3, and 4), we show that the acetylcholinesterase species expressed by transfected recombinant DNA have the properties expected for the respective enzyme forms found in tissue. Antisense mRNA derived from these cDNAs has been employed to examine differential splicing in various tissues. In most cells, the hydrophilic form of AChE encoded by the exon 4 to exon 6 splice to form the mRNA is the predominant species. However, splicing of exon 4 to exon 5, yielding a mRNA encoding the glycophospholipid-linked form of acetylcholinesterase, is seen primarily in erythroid and to a lesser extent in AtT-20 cells. Only small amounts of this mRNA species appear in some other cells in culture. A novel third mRNA species, which arises from an extension of exon 4 without splicing to a downstream exon, is seen in mouse erythroid but not in human erythroid cells. A cDNA encoding this species when expressed in COS cells gives rise to a unique hydrophilic, secreted form of acetylcholinesterase. Transfection of a human genomic clone into mouse erythroleukemia cells does not result in the appearance of a mRNA species with an extension of exon 4 as seen with the endogenous mouse gene. Hence, differential splicing between the mouse and human genes appears intrinsic to the coding sequence and is not dependent solely on specific factors in the mouse erythroleukemia cell."

Neurosci. 11, 2303-2313) provided evidence for three isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) in Aplysia, two of which, Apl I and Apl II, are expressed abundantly in the nervous system. We resolve two major kinase activities from nervous tissue by column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite (HAP), one Ca(2+)-activated and the other Ca(2+)-independent. We show that these two activities correspond to the previously cloned Apl I and II. These two isoforms appear to be the only major PKCs present in nervous tissue. The Apl I kinase is strongly activated by cis-fatty acids but only in the presence of Ca2+. Thus functionally, Apl I is more like the alpha and beta isoforms of vertebrate PKC, than to the vertebrate neural gamma isoform. The Apl II kinase is Ca(2+)-independent and resembles vertebrate PKC epsilon. The simplicity of the PKC isoform distribution in Aplysia makes this mollusc an attractive animal for understanding the differential regulation and physiological activities of Ca(2+)-activated and Ca(2+)-independent PKCs."
https://openalex.org/W1602014917,"Abstract The current model for processing DNA during entry in the transformation of Streptococcus pneumoniae is that following double-strand cleavage of DNA bound at the cell surface, uptake of one strand proceeds linearly from a newly formed 3'-end with simultaneous degradation of the opposite strand. Two important predictions of this model have been tested in the work reported here: first that the polarity of DNA degradation is the opposite of that for entry, and second that the rate of DNA degradation is (at least) equal to the rate of entry. The processing of DNA during entry was investigated using donor molecules constructed in vitro and labeled in one strand only. With uniformly labeled donor molecules, an amount of label equivalent to that taken up by the cells was recovered in acid-soluble form in the transformation medium. Experiments with 3'- or 5'-end-labeled molecules revealed that whereas essentially all of the 3'-end label was susceptible to degradation, most 5'-end label was resistant. Kinetic analysis of both entry and degradation revealed very similar rates for these processes, about 100 nucleotides s-1 at 31 degrees C, suggesting that they occur concomitantly. Entry and degradation appear to proceed with opposite polarity, 3'-->5' for entry and 5'-->3' for degradation. A prediction of the entry model, that a single-strand interruption would inhibit the uptake of DNA sequences located 5' to the nick, was confirmed experimentally. Therefore, we suggest that an intact sugar phosphate backbone is required by the entry machinery for continuous uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1486779406,"Human factor XSanto Domingo is a form of coagulation factor X in which a mutation within the signal peptide region of the precursor protein has been correlated genetically with a severe deficiency of factor X in the affected individual. A point mutation results in substitution of Arg for Gly at the critical -3 position of the factor X signal peptide. To determine the biochemical effect of this mutation on the biosynthesis of factor X, the wild-type and mutant factor X cDNAs were subcloned into a vector for transcription and translation in vitro. Translation products of mRNAs encoding portions of both mutant and wild-type proteins were used in a systematic biochemical approach to evaluate directly the effect of the mutation on targeting, transport, and proteolytic processing in vitro. The results show that targeting and transport of factor XSanto Domingo to the endoplasmic reticulum are functionally dissociated from the removal of the signal peptide by signal peptidase. Factor XSanto Domingo is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum but not processed by signal peptidase. Transient expression of the wild-type and mutant factor X in human embryonic kidney 293 cells revealed apparently normal secretion of the glycosylated two-chain form of factor X but no secretion of factor XSanto Domingo. Thus, the inability of signal peptidase to cleave factor XSanto Domingo is directly responsible for the absence of circulating factor X and leads to the bleeding diathesis in the affected individual."
https://openalex.org/W1521059224,"Lysosomal H(+)-ATPase was purified to homogeneity from rat liver lysosomes. It is a bafilomycin A1-sensitive Mg(2+)-ATPase, which reacts with antibodies against the 16- and 70-kDa subunits of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (Nezu, J., Motojima, K., Tamura, H., and Ohkuma, S. (1992) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 112, 212-219), and has been separated from both the N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive/bafilomycin A1-insensitive Mg(2+)-ATPase (ATPase I) and the NEM-insensitive Mg2+/Ca(2+)-ATPase (ATPase II) (Hayashi, H., Arai, K., Sato, O., Shimaya, A., Sai, Y., and Ohkuma, S. (1992) Chem. Pharm. Bull. 40, 2783-2786). The purified enzyme had the subunit structure of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase, consisting of 110-, 70-, 56-, 42-, 39-, 34-, (32-,) and 16-kDa proteins. It had optimal activity at a pH of 7.0-8.0, with an apparently single Km value for ATP of 95 microM. It hydrolyzed ATP > or = dATP >> GTP, ITP >> UTP, but not CTP, and was inhibited by ADP. It demonstrated divalent cation specificity in the order of Mg2+, Mn2+ > Fe2+, Co2+ > Ca2+. Among various anions, Cl-, Br-, and F- activated ATPase activity, whereas NO3- inhibited activity. It was inhibited not only by bafilomycin A1 but also by NEM, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, quercetin, and dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide. The purified enzyme was incorporated into proteoliposomes where its proton pump activity was reconstituted. This suggested that the isolated enzyme maintains its H+ translocation activity. These findings suggest that the isolated enzyme is an anion-sensitive vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase that functions as a lysosomal proton pump."
https://openalex.org/W1518683637,"A cDNA encoding the flavin-containing monooxygenase of rabbit lung (FMO 1B1) was expressed in yeast and Escherichia coli and the recombinant enzymes characterized. A high copy, isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible E. coli expression vector, pKKHC, was used for expression in E. coli strain JM109, and a galactose-inducible vector, YEp53, was used for expression in yeast strain 334. Following transcriptional induction with IPTG or galactose, subcellular fractions were prepared and analyzed immunochemically and catalytically. Antibodies to rabbit FMO 1B1 were used to detect the recombinant proteins in the 100,000 x g pellet prepared from the 10,000 x g supernatant fraction of yeast homogenates and the 2,000 x g supernatant fraction of E. coli homogenates. No FMO 1B1 was detected in cytosol. Mobilities of the recombinant proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis appeared identical to that of the native microsomal enzyme. Catalytic similarity to the native FMO 1B1 was demonstrated by the ability of the expressed enzymes to metabolize methimazole, thiourea, dimethylaniline, and cysteamine, but not chlorpromazine or imipramine. In addition, the recombinant enzymes exhibited a number of the unique physical properties associated with FMO 1B1, including stability to elevated temperature and activation by sodium cholate and magnesium chloride. Based on the specific content of FAD, the level of expression was estimated to be approximately 2% of the total protein in the E. coli 100,000 x g particulate fraction and 1% in the fraction from yeast. To demonstrate the utility of the E. coli expression system for studying structure/function relationships of the flavin-containing monooxygenase, two mutant FMOs were expressed and characterized. One mutant, formed by deletion of a putative membrane-anchoring peptide (the 26 carboxyl-terminal amino acids) was tested for membrane association. No difference in the subcellular distribution was found between the truncated and unmodified proteins, suggesting that the 26-residue COOH-terminal peptide is not important in membrane association. Catalytic analysis of the truncated FMO 1B1 established its functional similarity to the full-length protein, indicating that the COOH terminus does not contribute to any of the unique properties of the lung enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1482055219,"The intracellular fate of antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligomers) is poorly understood. Recent observations strongly suggest that after endocytosis and escape from the endocytic compartments, oligomers accumulate in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells by simple diffusion. Isolated nuclei were used to determine the number of these nuclear binding sites and their affinity for phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, and methyl-phosphonate oligomers. These cell-free assays were correlated with intact cell microinjection experiments. Great differences have been observed between these analogs. These data are helpful in understanding the fate of oligomers and the mechanism of their action and could be helpful for a more rational design of antisense molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1528356457,"Abstract The membrane glycoprotein (gp55) encoded by the env gene of Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) causes mitogenesis of infected erythroblasts and is inefficiently (3-5%) processed from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) to plasma membranes. Recent evidence suggested that gp55 binds to erythropoietin receptors (EpoR) in the RER, and it was proposed that this intracellular interaction causes mitogenesis (Li, J.-P., D'Andrea, A. D., Lodish, H. F., and Baltimore, D. (1990) Nature 343, 762-764). Other evidence has indicated that the plasma membrane component (gp55P) can also complex with EpoR. To identify the site of functional complexes and to study the factors that control their formation, we analyzed eight SFFV env mutants that contain in-frame deletions or linker insertions. The three nonpathogenic mutants encode gp55s that fail to leave the RER, whereas the five pathogenic mutants encode glycoproteins that occur on cell surfaces. Although BaF3 hematopoietic cells are interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent, a cellular derivative BaF3/EpoR that contains EpoR survives and grows in either IL-3 or erythropoietin (Epo). The five pathogenic SFFV env mutants converted BaF3/EpoR but not BaF3 cells to growth factor independence, whereas the nonpathogenic mutants did not eliminate growth factor requirements of any cells. Studies using 125I-Epo and the covalent cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate provided unambiguous evidence for ternary complexes of 125I-Epo.EpoR.gp55P on surfaces of all factor-independent cells. Size of the cell surface complex was correspondingly reduced in the case of a newly isolated SFFV mutant that encodes a severely truncated (M(r) approximately 41,000) but mitogenically active env glycoprotein. Our results support the hypothesis that activation of EpoR by the SFFV env glycoprotein occurs exclusively on cell surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1522997760,"Doxorubicin (Dox, adriamycin), an antineoplastic agent that can cause dilated cardiomyopathy, selectively inhibits muscle-specific gene expression in rodent cardiac muscle cells. This study shows that Dox treatment of proliferating C2 myoblasts, an established cell line from mouse skeletal muscle, completely prevents both fusion and accumulation of muscle-specific gene transcripts without significantly altering non-muscle gene transcripts. When added to high density cultures, Dox only blocked myotube formation but did not inhibit induction of muscle-specific genes. Transient transfection into C2 myoblasts showed that the transcriptional expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmids regulated by either the cardiac alpha-actin promoter or the muscle creatine kinase enhancer, but not with a viral or beta-actin promoter, was significantly diminished by Dox in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, exposure of C2 myoblasts to Dox had a profound effect on the expression of regulatory genes critical to the myogenic differentiation program; mRNAs for MyoD and myogenin were dramatically reduced and Id mRNA was concomitantly increased. In addition, there was diminished DNA binding activity of the muscle-specific transcription factor, MEF-2. These results suggest that Dox inhibits myogenesis by preventing muscle-specific gene expression, possibly through affecting the myogenic programs controlled by muscle-specific transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1495313727,"Adenosine deaminase was overexpressed in a baculovirus system. The pure recombinant and native enzymes were identical in size, Zn2+ content, and activity. Five amino acids, in proximity to the active site, were replaced by mutagenesis. The altered enzymes were purified to homogeneity and compared to wild-type adenosine deaminase with respect to zinc content, enzymatic activity, and kinetic parameters. All but one of the alterations produced significant activity perturbations. Replacement of Cys262 produced a protein that retained at least 30-40% of wild-type activity. In contrast, replacements of His17, His214, His238, and Glu217 resulted in dramatic losses of enzyme activity. None of these mutants exhibited large variations in Km. The proteins produced from alterations of amino acids implicated in metal coordination were slightly activated by inclusion of Zn2+ throughout purification. These experiments confirm that in the active enzyme Zn2+ plays a critical role in catalysis, that a histidine or glutamate residue plays a mechanistic role in the hydrolytic deamination step, and that cysteine is not involved in the catalytic mechanism of adenosine deaminase. These data support the roles for these amino acid residues suggested from the x-ray structure of murine adenosine deaminase (Wilson, D. K., Rudolf, F. B., and Quicho, F. A. (1991) Science 252, 1278-1284)."

Sequence analyses located a putative myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor (MEF-2) site situated in the regulatory region of this gene proximal to the start site of transcription. The role of this element in directing the cardiac compartment-specific expression of the transgene was assessed. The polymerase chain reaction was used to perform substitution mutagenesis of the MEF-2 binding site, and lack of MEF-2 binding was confirmed by gel retardation assays. The resultant construct was used to generate transgenic mice. Surprisingly, transgene expression was not down-regulated, but was significantly increased in the hearts of the MEF-2 mutant mice. In addition, cardiac-specific expression of the transgene was perturbed with significant levels of ectopic expression occurring in the aorta."
https://openalex.org/W1486708107,"Our objective was to isolate from rat liver mitochondria the malonyl-CoA-regulated and detergent-labile enzyme, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), whose properties and relationship to CPT II have been the subject of debate. After exposure of mitochondria to the dinitrophenol derivative of etomoxir-CoA (DNP-Et-CoA, a covalent inhibitor of CPT I), followed by detergent solubilization and blue Sepharose chromatography, the DNP-Et-labeled CPT I could be readily visualized on immunoblots using an anti-DNP monoclonal antibody. This material was used to raise a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognized CPT I regardless of whether it was carrying a covalent ligand. Exposure of membranes from untreated mitochondria to a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin caused rapid loss of CPT I activity with a concomitant disappearance of immunodetectable protein. However, inclusion of malonyl-CoA in such incubations afforded major protection of CPT I activity. Under these conditions CPT I simply underwent truncation from approximately 90 to approximately 82 kDa. This was also true if CPT I had first been labeled with Et-CoA or DNP-Et-CoA prior to protease treatment. Thus, the presence of an inhibitor, whether reversible or irreversible, at the active site of CPT I limited the action of trypsin/chymotrypsin to removal of a small portion of the protein which was probably not necessary for catalytic function. These and other experiments with antibodies and proteases provided additional insight into the membrane topology of CPT I. They also strengthened our conviction that CPT I and CPT II are distinct proteins and that the former exists as tissue-specific isoforms. Finally, the 82-kDa truncated form of rat liver CPT I was isolated and subjected to partial amino acid analysis. Four unambiguous peptide sequences were obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2114991582,"The corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (C/Fe-SP) from Clostridium thermoaceticum acts as a methyl group carrier in the anaerobic acetyl-CoA pathway of CO and CO2 fixation. Consisting of a small (approximately 33 kDa) and a large (approximately 55 kDa) subunit, the C/Fe-SP contains 1 mol of cobalt in a corrinoid cofactor and 1 mol of [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster/mol of alpha beta dimer. Cobalt is the site of methylation, and the [4Fe-4S] center appears to serve an electron transfer function. The genes encoding both subunits have been cloned previously and are located within a gene cluster that includes other genes required for CO2 fixation by anaerobic bacteria. When the genes encoding the C/Fe-SP were expressed in Escherichia coli, the protein was found to be inactive. We report the amino acid sequences of the large and small subunits of the C/Fe-SP based on the DNA sequences of the cloned genes. The [4Fe-4S] cluster was found to be located in the large subunit. Although the primary structural lattice for cobamide binding resides in the small subunit, both subunits are required for formation of a stable cobamide-binding protein. Based on sequence comparisons with other [4Fe-4S]-containing proteins, 3 of the 4 cysteine residues that serve as ligands to the iron sites in the cluster have been located. The two subunits were independently overexpressed in E. coli to a level of 30-50% of cell protein; however, the resulting protein was inactive, lacked stoichiometric amounts of Fe-S cluster, and lacked cobamide. By combining the recombinant subunits, unfolding them with urea, and refolding in the presence of cobamide, iron, and inorganic sulfide, the resulting C/Fe-SP was found to contain stoichiometric amounts of cobamide and [4Fe-4S] cluster and had spectroscopic and enzymatic properties similar to those of the native protein. We expect that the methods developed here may be used for heterologous overexpression and reconstitution of other complex metalloenzymes. The C/Fe-SP was found to utilize with equal efficiency either vitamin B12 or the natural cofactor 5-methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide as a methyl carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1587135257,"The tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) directly activates protein kinase C (PKC) and, in human platelets, induces aggregation, release of granular contents, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ as detected by the photoprotein aequorin, and phosphorylation of the 47-kDa substrate (p47) of PKC. Whether PKC activation by PMA or other agonists requires translocation of PKC from the cytoplasm to the lipids of the platelet surface membrane, however, is not known. Bryostatin-1, a macrocyclic lactone that binds to PKC at or near the PMA-binding site and thus blocks PMA's proliferative effects, induced concentration-dependent p47 phosphorylation, platelet aggregation, release of dense granule contents, and a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ (ED50 = 2.0 nM) in intact aequorin-loaded platelets. Neither alpha-, beta-, delta-, or zeta-PKC isozymes translocated to the plasma membrane following bryostatin-1, although translocation of both alpha- and beta-PKC isozymes was seen in PMA-stimulated platelets. In a cell-free assay, bryostatin-1 activated PKC purified from platelets if the membrane-derived lipid phosphatidyl serine was present; however, if 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid or arachidonic acid, two lipid products formed in the cytoplasm of activated platelets, were present, no membrane-derived lipids were required for bryostatin-induced PKC activation. Thus, phosphorylation of PKC substrates and associated functional changes do not require isozyme translocation to the surface membrane, even when these events are induced by a direct activator of PKC."

We report the characterization of the cis- and trans-acting elements involved in the tissue-specific activity of the L gene erythroid promoter. A R-PK DNA fragment extending from -870 to +54 relative to the cap site confers erythroid specificity to a reporter gene. Within this region, we define a minimal promoter (-62 to +54) that displays erythroid-specific activity and contains two DNA binding sites. One, located at -50, binds members of the CCACC/Sp1 family and the other, located at -20, binds the erythroid factor GATA-1. Although the -20 GATA binding site (AGATAA) is also a potential TFIID binding site, it does not bind TFIID. Furthermore, the substitution of this GATA binding site by a canonical TFIID binding site suppresses the promoter activity. Mutations and deletions of both sites indicate that only the association of CCACC/Sp1 and GATA binding sites can drive efficient and tissue-specific expression of this R-PK minimal promoter. Finally, by co-transfection experiments, we study the elements involved in the hGATA-1 transactivation of the R-PK promoter in HeLa cells."

Although the sequences of the two isozymes are highly conserved except for a 78-residue insertion found uniquely in the type L isozyme, they differ strikingly in affinities for substrates. To examine whether the insertion in the type L isozyme plays a role in enzymic functions, particularly in substrate specificities, we have constructed a chimeric enzyme, in which a 189-residue sequence of the type L isozyme including the insertion and its flanking regions is replaced by the corresponding sequence (112 residues) of the type H isozyme lacking the insertion. The gene for the chimeric enzyme as well as the cDNA for the type L isozyme were expressed at a low temperature in Escherichia coli cells under the control of the strong T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The purified chimeric phosphorylase was five times less active than the parent type L isozyme, but its affinity for glycogen was much higher than that of the type L isozyme and only slightly lower than that of the type H isozyme. The Michaelis constants of the chimeric enzyme for small oligosaccharides were comparable with those of the type L isozyme. These results provide evidence for the role of the 78-residue insertion in the type L isozyme, lowering the affinity of the enzyme for large, branched substrates probably through steric hindrance. It is also assumed that the corresponding region in the type H isozyme contains a high affinity site like the glycogen storage site occurring in the animal enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1489383278,"The comparison of the resonance Raman spectrum of the deoxy dimeric hemoglobin (HbI) from the Arcid clam, Scapharca inaequivalvis, to its CO photoproduct at 10 ns reveals several significant differences in the low frequency vibrational modes including those involving motions of the peripheral substituents on the heme such as the propionates. This finding reflects the involvement of the propionates in a hydrogen bonding network which connects the two heme groups across the subunit interface and is sensitive to ligand binding. A frequency difference in the iron-histidine stretching mode of 6 cm-1 in this invertebrate hemoglobin is substantially smaller than that detected in tetrameric vertebrate hemoglobins under similar conditions. Time evolution studies of the vibrational modes from the photoproduct demonstrate that the transient form relaxes to the deoxy structure concertedly with a half-life of 1 microseconds, the time scale in which tertiary relaxations of tetrameric hemoglobins occur. These data establish that the tertiary and quaternary structural changes take place on the same time scale and confirm a mechanism of cooperativity involving direct interaction between the two heme groups through the peripheral substituents. This direct structural communication provides a very tight linkage between the heme groups prohibiting modulation of the oxygen affinity by factors in the physiological milieu."

There is a change in absorbance of deoxyhemoglobin following photolysis at a rate of 1.2 x 10(6) s-1, consistent with a shift in the position of the Soret band to longer wavelengths. The amplitude of the change is proportional to the population of deoxydimer. In much of the Soret region this change is greater than the absorbance excursion associated with geminate recombination. There is at least one other slower change associated with the singly liganded species. Geminate rebinding of NO has components of 50, 8, and 0.035 ns-1, accounting for 75%, 25%, and less than 1% of the total reaction observed after a 35-ps photolysis flash.

One of the expressed fusion proteins has normal specific enzyme activity, and a second has reduced specific activity. Both clones were completely sequenced and yielded identical DNA sequence, except that one clone contained an additional 36 bases of 5' sequence. The various clones of this cDNA code for an EcoRI insert of 1.5 +/- 0.1 kb, and the open reading frame corresponds to a protein of 393 amino acids (M(r) = 44,042), in good agreement with the M(r) of approximately 42,000 for the native enzyme on SDS-gel electrophoresis.

Chemical analysis of the native enzyme shows 2 zinc atoms per subunit, and the sequence of beta-alanine synthase contains 2 putative zinc-binding site motifs. Comparison of amino acid sequence, deduced from the cDNA sequence, to sequences in the protein data base showed that it is a unique sequence and that it has about 20% identity to aspartate carbamoyltransferase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, urease, and leucine aminopeptidase; enzymes that bind comparable ligands or have a similar mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1582922696,"Casein kinase II (CKII), an ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase in control of a variety of crucial cellular functions, is composed of catalytic subunits (alpha and alpha') and regulatory subunits (beta). The adjusted activity of CKII is determined by the actual conformational state of CKII beta and the stoichiometry of the CKII subunits. Thus, the expression control of CKII beta is of particular concern. Carrying out gel shifts and footprints with affinity-purified proteins and cellular extracts in combination with mutational analysis we find that aside NF1 and Sp1, two out of the many factors predicted to bind to the upstream promoter region of the human CKII beta gene (Voss, H., Wirkner, U., Jakobi, R., Hewitt, N. A., Schwager, C., Zimmermann, J., Ansorge, W., and Pyerin, W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 13706-13711), CKII alpha protein is able to complex with the CKII beta gene promoter. The complex of CKII beta-DNA/CKII alpha-protein is shown to occur within the 170-239-base pair (bp) segment upstream of the first transcription start site of the gene. The DNA motif contains, in a distance of 44 bp, two GC-rich boxes, 5'-GGGGCCC and 5'-CCCCTGGGC, and represents a novel cis-acting element; the binding of the CKII alpha protein activates the CKII beta gene promoter. This is manifested by driving the expression of the indicator gene luciferase or of CKII alpha-cDNA in HeLa cells. The binding of the CKII alpha protein is inhibited due to CKII beta protein addition or by mimicking the corresponding situation in vivo by overexpression of the CKII subunits. The data suggest that cells may maintain a certain CKII subunit stoichiometry via transcriptional control; excess of nuclear CKII alpha protein could activate the CKII beta gene transcription causing CKII beta protein to increase which, in turn, could feed back to abolish the action of CKII alpha at the CKII beta gene promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1565738858,"Glutamine tRNA synthetase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been purified to homogeneity and shown to be a monomer of 91 kDa. The size of the polypeptide agrees with that predicted from the previously reported translated DNA sequence. Mild tryptic digestion removes an amino-terminal domain and releases a fragment of 65 kDa which begins at Ser205. This tryptic fragment is similar in size and sequence to Escherichia coli glutamine tRNA synthetase and shows a modest increase from the full-length yeast enzyme in the Km values for glutamine and ATP and no difference in the kcat for aminoacylation or the Km for tRNA. Thus, the removal of the NH2-terminal domain appears to indirectly affect the ATP- and glutamine-binding sites in the nucleotide-binding fold domain to which the NH2-terminal domain is fused. A monoclonal antibody directed against the NH2-terminal domain of the full-length enzyme has little effect upon the aminoacylation activity. Therefore, over 200 amino acids of the NH2 terminus of the full-length enzyme form a domain that operationally has only a modest influence on the catalytic core of the protein. These studies reinforce the concept that eukaryotic synthetases have quasi-independent domains not found in their prokaryotic counterparts which may confer a function distinct from aminoacylation."

Using an engineered thrombin cleavage site, we have investigated the solubility properties of the periplasmic domain of PBP 1B. Twelve amino acids, comprised of the consensus thrombin cleavage site (LVPR decreases GS) and flanking glycine residues, were inserted into PBP 1B just past its putative transmembrane segment. To aid in purification, a hexa-histidine tag was also inserted at its amino terminus, and the engineered protein (PBP 1B-GT/H6) was purified and characterized. Inclusion of the thrombin cleavage site had no effect on the protein's intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and affinity for [14C]penicillin G, indicating that the protein structure was not significantly perturbed. PBP 1B-GT/H6 was readily cleaved by thrombin at low thrombin/protein ratios to a protein with properties consistent with the removal of its cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane regions. Cleavage of the protein was dependent upon the presence of the thrombin cleavage site, and the thrombin-cleaved protein (PBP 1Bper) displayed an identical affinity for [14C] penicillin G binding as wild-type PBP 1B and uncleaved PBP 1B-GT/H6. [14C]Penicillin G-labeled PBP 1Bper eluted from a gel filtration column in the presence but not in the absence of 0.7% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1- propanesulfonic acid, and PBP 1Bper was found entirely in the membrane fraction of a thrombin digest of membranes containing overproduced PBP 1B-GT/H6. To further characterize this unusual solubility behavior, purified PBP 1Bper was reconstituted into lipid vesicles, which were then floated on a sucrose gradient. Floated vesicles contained > 95% of total 125I-penicillin V binding, indicating that PBP 1Bper directly associates with lipid membranes. These results strongly suggest that the periplasmic domain of PBP 1B associates with membranes independent of its amino terminal transmembrane region."
https://openalex.org/W2159541159,"The arcDABC operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes the enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway and is induced by oxygen limitation. The arcD gene specifies a 53-kDa protein with arginine: ornithine exchange activity. The ArcD protein of P. aeruginosa, like the LysI lysine transporter of Corynebacterium glutamicum, has 13 hydrophobic regions which could span the cytoplasmic membrane. Fusion of a Caa (colicin A) epitope to the N-terminal part of ArcD permitted the localization, by immunoblotting, of the hybrid protein in the inner membrane of P. aeruginosa. Fusion of PhoA (alkaline phosphatase) to the very C terminus of ArcD produced another hybrid protein, which exhibited PhoA activity. Both ArcD hybrid proteins retained arginine transport activity and served to support a topological model which proposes that the N terminus is oriented toward the cytoplasm and the C terminus faces the periplasm. Further ArcD-PhoA fusions were consistent with this model. When the Caa epitope was fused to a C-terminal ArcD fragment consisting of only 5 hydrophobic domains, the resulting hybrid protein could be recovered intact from the inner membrane, suggesting that the C-terminal part of ArcD contains sufficient information for insertion into the membrane. This study illustrates the utility of the Caa epitope to tag membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1551507634,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP bound to the 40 S ribosomal initiation complex has been purified from yeast cell lysates. The purified factor eluted from gel filtration columns as a protein of apparent M(r) = 45,000-50,000. However, when the purified preparation was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, two distinct polypeptides of apparent M(r) = 54,000 and 56,000 were observed. Each of the two polypeptides individually was found to contain eIF-5 activity, and they were immunologically related to each other. In less pure preparations of yeast eIF-5, however, a significant proportion of eIF-5 activity eluted from gel filtration columns as a protein of M(r) > 140,000. Immunochemical methods were therefore employed to determine the molecular structure of eIF-5 in crude yeast cell lysates. Antisera against purified yeast eIF-5 were prepared in rabbits and shown to be highly potent in inhibiting eIF-5-mediated 80 S initiation complex formation. When crude eIF-5 preparations, as well as yeast cells that were lysed directly into a denaturing buffer containing 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate, were analyzed by Western blots probed with affinity-purified anti-eIF-5 antibodies, a major immunoreactive polypeptide (apparent M(r) = 54,000) and a minor band (apparent M(r) = 56,000) were observed. No precursor forms of molecular weight higher than 56,000 were detected in any preparations. These results suggest that yeast eIF-5 is a monomeric protein of apparent M(r) = 50,000-56,000."
https://openalex.org/W1623590084,"A Photosystem II (PSII) reaction center particle from the stroma lamellae of Spirodela oligorrhiza has been isolated. The stroma lamellar PSII reaction center contained the same proteins found in granal PSII reaction centers, namely D1, D2, and cytochrome b559; however, the cytochrome b559 content was half of that in the granal centers. The pigment composition, 77 K fluorescence emission, and excitation spectra of the stroma lamellar reaction centers were determined. Our results indicate a fully functional PSII particle in the stromal lamellae."
https://openalex.org/W1558507964,"The gene I protein (pI) of the f1 filamentous bacteriophage is a non-capsid protein that is required for the assembly of the bacteriophage. It spans the Escherichia coli inner membrane once with its amino terminus in the cytoplasm and its carboxyl-terminal portion in the periplasm. The presence of moderate amounts of this protein in the membrane results in rapid inhibition of cell growth, probably from a loss of membrane potential. Previous observations defined a 55-amino-acid sequence within pI required for its membrane insertion which includes a 20-residue hydrophobic stretch preceded by a 13-residue positively charged amphiphilic helix. To define the minimal sequence required for membrane translocation and for growth inhibition, a deletion analysis was performed on a tripartite fusion construct containing the 55-residue pI sequence flanked upstream by the amino-terminal portion of EcoRI endonuclease and downstream by the enzymatic portion of alkaline phosphatase. Only the 20-residue hydrophobic stretch immediately preceded by 1 arginine residue is required for membrane insertion of the fusion proteins. This region also sufficed to inhibit cell growth provided it contained protein domains exposed in both the cytoplasm and periplasm. It was not possible to separate the domains required for membrane insertion and cell growth inhibition. No requirement for the positively charged amphiphilic helix was detected either for membrane insertion or growth inhibition, suggesting that it plays a role in phage assembly and not membrane insertion."
https://openalex.org/W1576005528,"A tripartite fusion construct encoding the amino-terminal half of EcoRI endonuclease followed by amino acids 217-299 of the filamentous bacteriophage gene I protein (pI) attached to the enzymatic portion of alkaline phosphatase results in the production of two proteins. The larger protein, pIf, is the complete tripartite fusion protein while the smaller protein, pIf*, results from internal initiation of translation at pI methionine 241. Both pIf and pIf* span the Escherichia coli inner membrane via a 20-amino-acid hydrophobic stretch of pI with their amino termini in the cytoplasm and their carboxyl-terminal alkaline phosphatase domains in the periplasm. The alkaline phosphatase moiety of approximately 70% of pIf is released into the periplasm by in vivo proteolysis, but only about 10% of pIf* is cleaved. Neither DegP, OmpT, nor protease III are responsible for the cleavage in vivo, and leader peptidase is unable to cleave the fusion protein in vitro. Deletion and substitution analyses demonstrate that the degree of periplasmic cleavage depends on the sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of the fusion proteins. Possible mechanisms for this transmembrane-directed cleavage event are compared to proposed models for signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1653692936,"To determine whether the fibrin-binding domains of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) can confer enhanced catalytic activity to single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scuPA), we constructed, expressed, and characterized the kinetics of five recombinant tPA/scuPA hybrid molecules. The hybrid molecules are: 1) tPA3-50 (tPA finger)/scuPA138-411, 2) tPA177-256 (tPA kringle2)/scuPA140-411 (scuPA catalytic), 3) tPA3-50/tPA177-256/scuPA140-411, 4) scuPA1-47 (scuPA growth factor)/tPA177-256/scuPA140-411, and 5) scuPA1-138 (scuPA growth factor and kringle)tPA127-256/scuPA139-411. The amidolytic activity of all hybrids was comparable, as were the kinetics for conversion from single-chain to two-chain plasminogen activator. We found that 1) the lag time prior to achieving maximal velocity among these hybrids varied, 2) hybrids 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 2-134-fold more potent (by kcat/Km) than hybrid 1, and 3) those hybrid proteins containing the tPA finger domain (hybrids 1 and 3) gave a 2-fold increase in catalytic efficiency in the presence of DESAFIB (reptilase-digested fibrinogen). These kinetic differences are likely mediated by changes in the tertiary structure of the scuPA catalytic domain resulting from interactions between catalytic and noncatalytic domains in the presence of fibrin."
