https://openalex.org/W2027785297,"The mTORC1 kinase promotes growth in response to growth factors, energy levels, and amino acids, and its activity is often deregulated in disease. The Rag GTPases interact with mTORC1 and are proposed to activate it in response to amino acids by promoting mTORC1 translocation to a membrane-bound compartment that contains the mTORC1 activator, Rheb. We show that amino acids induce the movement of mTORC1 to lysosomal membranes, where the Rag proteins reside. A complex encoded by the MAPKSP1, ROBLD3, and c11orf59 genes, which we term Ragulator, interacts with the Rag GTPases, recruits them to lysosomes, and is essential for mTORC1 activation. Constitutive targeting of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface is sufficient to render the mTORC1 pathway amino acid insensitive and independent of Rag and Ragulator, but not Rheb, function. Thus, Rag-Ragulator-mediated translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomal membranes is the key event in amino acid signaling to mTORC1."

Seol et al. (p. 213 ; see the Perspective by Prasher ) measured the thermal conductivity of graphene supported on silicon dioxide and found that, while the conductivity was considerably lower than that of free-standing graphene, it was still greater than that of metals such as copper. A theoretical model suggested that the out-of-plane flexing vibrations of the graphene play a key role in thermal transport. Thus, graphene may help in applications such as conducting heat away from electronic circuits."

Previous work has characterized a peptide (iRGD) that selectively targets and penetrates tumor tissue by virtue of its specific interaction with tumor blood vessels. Now, studying mouse models, Sugahara et al. (p. 1031 , see the cover) show that coinjection of the iRGD peptide increases the tumor penetration and antitumor activity of several cancer drugs, including the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin and the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), without increasing their harmful effects on healthy tissue. Importantly, these effects did not require chemical conjugation of the cancer drugs to the peptide."

Similar approaches are not so successful for making propylene oxide—an important starting material for polyurethane plastics, which are made from chlorinated intermediates. Lei et al. (p. 224 ) report that silver trimers, Ag 3 , deposited on alumina are active for direct propylene oxide formation at low temperatures with only a low level of formation of CO 2 by-product, unlike larger particles that form from these clusters at higher temperatures. Density functional calculations suggest that the open-shell nature of the clusters accounts for the improved reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2129447571,"A hallmark of Huntington's disease is the accumulation of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin (htt) protein in striatal neurons. The removal of cytosolic mutant htt is known to be mediated by the macroautophagy-lysosomal system. Here the authors specifically identify the defective step of autophagy in Huntington's models, in which autophagosomes fail to recognize mutant htt as a cargo destined for degradation. Continuous turnover of intracellular components by autophagy is necessary to preserve cellular homeostasis in all tissues. Alterations in macroautophagy, the main process responsible for bulk autophagic degradation, have been proposed to contribute to pathogenesis in Huntington's disease (HD), a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. However, the precise mechanism behind macroautophagy malfunction in HD is poorly understood. In this work, using cellular and mouse models of HD and cells from humans with HD, we have identified a primary defect in the ability of autophagic vacuoles to recognize cytosolic cargo in HD cells. Autophagic vacuoles form at normal or even enhanced rates in HD cells and are adequately eliminated by lysosomes, but they fail to efficiently trap cytosolic cargo in their lumen. We propose that inefficient engulfment of cytosolic components by autophagosomes is responsible for their slower turnover, functional decay and accumulation inside HD cells."
https://openalex.org/W2170325085,"Arsenic, an ancient drug used in traditional Chinese medicine, has attracted worldwide interest because it shows substantial anticancer activity in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) exerts its therapeutic effect by promoting degradation of an oncogenic protein that drives the growth of APL cells, PML-RARalpha (a fusion protein containing sequences from the PML zinc finger protein and retinoic acid receptor alpha). PML and PML-RARalpha degradation is triggered by their SUMOylation, but the mechanism by which As2O3 induces this posttranslational modification is unclear. Here we show that arsenic binds directly to cysteine residues in zinc fingers located within the RBCC domain of PML-RARalpha and PML. Arsenic binding induces PML oligomerization, which increases its interaction with the small ubiquitin-like protein modifier (SUMO)-conjugating enzyme UBC9, resulting in enhanced SUMOylation and degradation. The identification of PML as a direct target of As2O3 provides new insights into the drug's mechanism of action and its specificity for APL."

https://openalex.org/W2022554767,"Hotspots on Venus The surface of Venus shows clear signs of volcanism, but are there active volcanoes on Venus today? The answer to this question will bear on our understanding of the planet's climate evolution and interior dynamics. Using surface thermal emissivity data returned by the Venus Express spacecraft, Smrekar et al. (p. 605 , published online 8 April) looked at three hotspots on Venus. These places were identified by analogy with terrestrial hotspots like Hawaii, which are believed to overlie mantle plumes and to be the most likely sites for current volcanic activity. Lava flows at the three hotspots have anomalously high thermal emissions when compared with their surroundings. Low emissivity is generally interpreted as the result of surface alteration by the corrosive atmosphere of Venus. High emissivity implies that not much alteration took place and thus that the hotspots must represent recently active volcanoes younger than 2.5 million years."
https://openalex.org/W2023563083,"Low reprogramming efficiency and reduced pluripotency have been the two major obstacles in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell research. An effective and quick method to assess the pluripotency levels of iPS cells at early stages would significantly increase the success rate of iPS cell generation and promote its applications. We have identified a conserved imprinted region of the mouse genome, the Dlk1-Dio3 region, which was activated in fully pluripotent mouse stem cells but repressed in partially pluripotent cells. The degree of activation of this region was positively correlated with the pluripotency levels of stem cells. A mammalian conserved cluster of microRNAs encoded by this region exhibited significant expression differences between full and partial pluripotent stem cells. Several microRNAs from this cluster potentially target components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and may form a feedback regulatory loop resulting in the expression of all genes and non-coding RNAs encoded by this region in full pluripotent stem cells. No other genomic regions were found to exhibit such clear expression changes between cell lines with different pluripotency levels; therefore, the Dlk1-Dio3 region may serve as a marker to identify fully pluripotent iPS or embryonic stem cells from partial pluripotent cells. These findings also provide a step forward toward understanding the operating mechanisms during reprogramming to produce iPS cells and can potentially promote the application of iPS cells in regenerative medicine and cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2082827602,"Stress and anxiety disorders are risk factors for depression and these behaviors are modulated by corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1) and serotonin receptor (5-HT(2)R). However, the potential behavioral and cellular interaction between these two receptors is unclear. We found that pre-administration of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) into the prefrontal cortex of mice enhanced 5-HT(2)R-mediated anxiety behaviors in response to 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine. In both heterologous cell cultures and mouse cortical neurons, activation of CRFR1 also enhanced 5-HT(2) receptor-mediated inositol phosphate formation. CRFR1-mediated increases in 5-HT(2)R signaling were dependent on receptor internalization and receptor recycling via rapid recycling endosomes, resulting in increased expression of 5-HT(2)R on the cell surface. Sensitization of 5-HT(2)R signaling by CRFR1 required intact PDZ domain-binding motifs at the end of the C-terminal tails of both receptor types. These data suggest a mechanism by which CRF, a peptide known to be released by stress, enhances anxiety-related behavior via sensitization of 5-HT(2)R signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2093274002,"Mammalian cells require non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) for the efficient repair of chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks. A key feature of biological sources of strand breaks is associated nucleotide damage, including base loss (abasic or apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites). At single-strand breaks, 5'-terminal abasic sites are excised by the 5'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (5'-dRP) lyase activity of DNA polymerase beta (pol beta): here we show, in vitro and in cells, that accurate and efficient repair by NHEJ of double-strand breaks with such damage similarly requires 5'-dRP/AP lyase activity. Classically defined NHEJ is moreover uniquely effective at coupling this end-cleaning step to joining in cells, helping to distinguish this pathway from otherwise robust alternative NHEJ pathways. The NHEJ factor Ku can be identified as an effective 5'-dRP/AP lyase. In a similar manner to other lyases, Ku nicks DNA 3' of an abasic site by a mechanism involving a Schiff-base covalent intermediate with the abasic site. We show by using cell extracts that Ku is essential for the efficient removal of AP sites near double-strand breaks and, consistent with this result, that joining of such breaks is specifically decreased in cells complemented with a lyase-attenuated Ku mutant. Ku had previously been presumed only to recognize ends and recruit other factors that process ends; our data support an unexpected direct role for Ku in end-processing steps as well."

In particular, Bax forms an oligomer that permeabilizes the membrane. To map the interface of the Bax oligomer we used Triton X-100 as a membrane surrogate and performed site-specific photocross-linking. Bax-specific adducts were formed through photo-reactive probes at multiple sites that can be grouped into two surfaces. The first surface overlaps with the BH1–3 groove formed by Bcl-2 Homology motif 1, 2, and 3; the second surface is a rear pocket located on the opposite side of the protein from the BH1–3 groove. Further cross-linking experiments using Bax BH3 peptides and mutants demonstrated that the two surfaces interact with their counterparts in neighboring proteins to form two separated interfaces and that interaction at the BH1–3 groove primes the rear pocket for further interaction. Therefore, Bax oligomerization proceeds through a series of interactions that occur at separate, yet allosterically, coupled interfaces.

https://openalex.org/W1984127026,"The Drosophila Toll receptor is activated by an endogenous cytokine ligand Spätzle. Active ligand is generated in response to positional cues in embryonic dorso-ventral patterning and microbial pathogens in the insect immune response. Spätzle is secreted as a pro-protein and is processed into an active form by the serine endoproteases Easter and Spätzle-processing enzyme during dorso-ventral patterning and infection, respectively. Here, we provide evidence for the molecular mechanism of this activation process. We show that the Spätzle prodomain masks a predominantly hydrophobic region of Spätzle and that proteolysis causes a conformational change that exposes determinants that are critical for binding to the Toll receptor. We also gather that a conserved sequence motif in the prodomain presents features of an amphipathic helix likely to bind a hydrophobic cleft in Spätzle thereby occluding the putative Toll binding region. This mechanism of activation has a striking similarity to that of coagulogen, a clotting factor of the horseshoe crab, an invertebrate that has changed little in 400 million years. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that an ancient passive defense system has been adapted during evolution and converted for use in a critical pathway of innate immune signaling and embryonic morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2004900242,"Recent reports have shown that T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent ATP release from T cells is involved in production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) through activation of P2 receptors. Stimulation of TCR induces ATP release from T cells through gap junction hemichannels and maxianion channels, at least in part. However, the mechanisms of ATP release from activated T cells are not fully understood. Here, we studied the mechanisms of ATP release during TCR-dependent T cell activation by investigating the effects of various inhibitors on TCR-dependent ATP release from murine T cells. We found that not only anion channel and gap junction hemichannel inhibitors, but also exocytosis inhibitors suppressed the ATP release. These results suggest that ATP release from murine T cells is regulated by various mechanisms, including exocytosis. An inhibitor of exocytosis, bafilomycin A, significantly blocked TCR signaling, such as Ca(2+) elevation and IL-2 production. Furthermore, bafilomycin A, ectonucleotidase, and P2Y(6) receptor antagonist significantly inhibited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from external antigen-restimulated splenocytes, indicating that vesicular exocytosis-mediated purinergic signaling has a significant role in TCR-dependent cytokine production. We also detected vesicular ATP in murine T cells and human T lymphoma Jurkat cells, both of which also expressed mRNA of SLC17A9, a vesicular nucleotide transporter. Knockdown of SLC17A9 in Jurkat cells markedly reduced ATP release and cytosolic Ca(2+) elevation after TCR stimulation, suggesting involvement of SLC17A9-dependent vesicular exocytosis in ATP release and T cell activation. In conclusion, vesicular exocytosis of ATP appears to play a role in T cell activation and immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1977927502,"Glycans (i.e. oligosaccharide chains attached to cellular proteins and lipids) are crucial for nearly all aspects of life, including the development of multicellular organisms. They come in multiple forms, and much of this diversity between molecules, cells, and tissues is generated by Golgi-resident glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. However, their exact mode of functioning in glycan processing is currently unclear. Here we investigate the supramolecular organization of the N-glycosylation pathway in live cells by utilizing the bimolecular fluorescence complementation approach. We show that all four N-glycosylation enzymes tested (beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II, 1,4-galactosyltransferase I, and alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase I) form Golgi-localized homodimers. Intriguingly, the same enzymes also formed two distinct and functionally relevant heterodimers between the medial Golgi enzymes beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II and the trans-Golgi enzymes 1,4-galactosyltransferase I and alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase I. Given their strict Golgi localization and sequential order of function, the two heterodimeric complexes are probably responsible for the processing and maturation of N-glycans in live cells."

Small peptides emulating the activity of one binding partner to antagonize the other play instrumental roles in drug screening and design. Despite their ability to bind proteins with high affinity and unsurpassed specificity, peptides themselves are rarely used as therapeutic agents due primarily to their poor in vivo stability. Even for in vitro applications, efficacy often necessitates peptide resistance to proteolytic degradation. To tackle peptide susceptibility to proteolysis, various peptidomimetic chemistries have been developed, involving the use of d-amino acids, unnatural amino acids, peptide backbone modifications, cyclizations, and secondary structure-inducing templates, among others (3Vagner J. Qu H. Hruby V.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Peptide retro-inverso isomerization, pioneered by Chorev and Goodman (4Chorev M. Goodman M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1979; 12: 1-7Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar), represents an elegant solution to functional peptides stable under physiological conditions. It is postulated that a retro-inverso peptide (a peptide of the reversed sequence made up of d-amino acids, also known as a retro-all-d- or retro-enantio-peptide) assumes a side chain topology, in its extended conformation, similar to that of its native l-sequence, thus emulating biological activities of the parent molecule while fully resistant to proteolytic degradation (4Chorev M. Goodman M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1979; 12: 1-7Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar).

Failures, however, have also been noted for retro-inverso isomers to elicit antibodies that cross-react with native immune epitopes (6Nair D.T. Kaur K.J. Singh K. Mukherjee P. Rajagopal D. George A. Bal V. Rath S. Rao K.V. Salunke D.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In fact, retro-inverso peptides are not isofunctional to their parent l-peptide molecules with respect to binding energetics even in some successful immunological applications of antigenic mimicry (7Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. van Regenmortel M.H. Briand J.P. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 9765-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This mixed outcome comes as no surprise, because antibody-antigen recognition is notoriously lenient at the structural level to tolerate conformational plasticity (8Sundberg E.J. Mariuzza R.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 61: 119-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). What surprises, however, is different outcomes arising from well characterized peptide-protein interacting systems where conformational rigidity or stability of a helical peptide ligand is key to its high affinity binding to the preformed cavity of a folded protein (9Pal-Bhowmick I. Pandey R.P. Jarori G.K. Kar S. Sahal D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 10Rai J. Chem. Biol.

Limited digestion of ribonuclease A by subtilisin generates S peptide (residues 1–20) and S protein (residues 21–124), which can reassociate with high affinity to form enzymatically active ribonuclease S (12Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1963; 32: 269-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two recent reports on the extensively studied S peptide-S protein interacting system have shown that it is structurally impossible for the retro-inverso isomer of the α-helical S peptide to functionally mimic S protein binding (9Pal-Bhowmick I. Pandey R.P. Jarori G.K. Kar S. Sahal D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 10Rai J. Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2007; 70: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, the exquisite specificity for recognition of the native S peptide is strictly maintained in antibody recognition and T cell stimulation (9Pal-Bhowmick I. Pandey R.P. Jarori G.K. Kar S. Sahal D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In studying the interaction between the tumor suppressor protein p53 and its negative regulator MDM2 (13Brown C.J. Lain S. Verma C.S. Fersht A.R. Lane D.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 862-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 14Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), however, Sakurai et al. (11Sakurai K. Chung H.S. Kahne D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16288-16289Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) found that p53(15–29) and its retro-inverso isomer displayed nearly identical binding affinities for the p53-binding domain of MDM2. To rationalize their unexpected finding, Sakura et al. (11Sakurai K. Chung H.S. Kahne D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16288-16289Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) suggested that the retro-all-d-peptide isomer of p53(15–29), like its parent l-peptide, adopted a right-handed helical conformation in the complex. These conceptually conflicting reports motivated us to carry out a comprehensive study of functional effects of peptide retro-inverso isomerization on the p53-MDM2 interaction, using a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and structural tools. The interactions of p53(15–29) with MDMX (a MDM2 homolog) and of PMI (a high affinity, dual specific peptide ligand of MDM2 and MDMX) with MDM2 were also subjected to investigation. To determine whether or not conclusions from the p53/PMI-MDM2/MDMX interactions are applicable to others, we expanded our study to include two additional, well characterized peptide-protein interacting systems: the C-terminal domain of HIV-1 2The abbreviations used are: HIVhuman immunodeficiency virusCAcapsid proteinCCAC-terminal domain of CASH3Src homology 3HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPBSphosphate-buffered salineTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphineSPRsurface plasmon resonanceRUresonance unitITCisothermal titration calorimetryELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTFEtrifluoroethanolRIretro-inverso isomer. capsid protein (CCA) and the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Abl tyrosine kinase with their respective peptide ligands. human immunodeficiency virus capsid protein C-terminal domain of CA Src homology 3 high pressure liquid chromatography phosphate-buffered saline tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine surface plasmon resonance resonance unit isothermal titration calorimetry enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay trifluoroethanol retro-inverso isomer. Total chemical synthesis of highly pure and correctly folded p53-binding domains of MDM2 (residues 25–109, referred to hereafter as synMDM2) and MDMX (residues 24–108 or synMDMX) has been described elsewhere (15Pazgier M. Liu M. Zou G. Yuan W. Li C. Li C. Li J. Monbo J. Zella D. Tarasov S.G. Lu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4665-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Abl SH3 domain was prepared as described (16Santamaria F. Wu Z. Boulègue C. Pál G. Lu W. J. Mol. Recognit. 2003; 16: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Folding of Abl SH3 domain was initiated by dissolving the polypeptide at 3 mg/ml in 0.2 m phosphate buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, followed by extensive dialysis (molecular weight cut-off 3000) in water at 4 °C. HIV CCA (S146PTSILDIRQG156PKEPFRDYVD166RFYKTLRAEQ176ASQEVKNWMT186ETLLVQNANP196DCKTILKALG206PGATLEEMMT216ACQGVGGPGH226KARVL) was made using native chemical ligation (17Dawson P.E. Kent S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 923-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 18Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar). The two peptide fragments of CCA, H2N-CA(146–197)αCOSR (where R represents CH2CO-Leu-OH) and H2N-CA(198–231)COOH, were individually synthesized on t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-OCH2-PAM resin using an optimized HBTU activation/DIEA in situ neutralization protocol developed by Kent and co-workers (19Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Crude peptides, after hydrogen fluoride cleavage and deprotection in the presence of 5% p-cresol at 0 °C, were precipitated with cold ether and purified by preparative C18 reversed-phase HPLC, and their molecular masses were ascertained by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The determined molecular mass of 9518.7 Da of the full-length ligation product agreed with the expected value of 9519.0 Da calculated on the basis of the average isotopic compositions of CCA. Spontaneous folding of CCA and formation of the disulfide bond between Cys198 and Cys218 was achieved through air oxidation in aqueous buffer. The determined molecular mass of 9517.1 ± 0.6 Da of oxidized CCA, differing by 2 mass units from the calculated value of 9519.0 Da of reduced CCA, confirmed the disulfide formation. End-capped p53(15–29) (Ac-SQETFSDLWKLLPEN-NH2) and its retro-inverso isomer RI-p53(15–29) (Ac-DNDEDPDLDLDKDWDLDDDSDFDTDEDQDS-NH2) were synthesized on 4-methyl-benzhydrylamine resin using the above described t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry. Both peptides were N-terminally acetylated on resin using acetic anhydride and DIEA (95:5). All other peptides were only C-terminally amidated: PMI (TSFAEYWNLLSP-NH2) and RI-PMI (DPDSDLDLDNDWDYDEDADFDSDT-NH2), CAI (ITFEDLLDYYGP-NH2) and RI-CAI (DPDGDYDYDDDLDLDDDEDFDTDI-NH2), Y4W-P40 (APTWSPPPPP-NH2) and RI-Y4W-P40 (DPDPDPDPDPDSDWDTDPDA-NH2), DPMI-α (DTDNDWDYDADNDLDEDKDLDLDR-NH2) and DPMI-β (DTDADWDYDADNDFDEDKDLDLDR-NH2), and RI-DPMI-β (RLLKEFNAYWAT-NH2). All peptides were purified to homogeneity by preparative C18 reversed-phase HPLC, and their molecular masses were ascertained by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Peptide and protein quantification was achieved by UV measurements at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients calculated according to a published algorithm (20Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3451) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter at room temperature using a 0.1-cm path length. p53(15–29) and RI-p53(15–29) were thoroughly dialyzed (2000 molecular weight cut-off dialysis cassette, Pierce) against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, to remove trace amounts of trifluoroacetic acid that interferes with CD measurements. Trp fluorescence spectra of p53(15–29) and RI-p53(15–29) in the presence and absence of synMDM2 were recorded at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) on a Varian (Cary) Eclipse fluorometer. TCEP was added to prevent oxidative dimerization of synMDM2 via a free Cys residue in the protein. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the width of both slits was set to 5 nm. The binding affinity of Y4W-P40 and RI-Y4W-P40 for Abl SH3 domain was determined essentially as described (16Santamaria F. Wu Z. Boulègue C. Pál G. Lu W. J. Mol. Recognit. 2003; 16: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, different concentrations of Y4W-P40 (0–20 μm) or RI-Y4W-P40 (0–200 μm) were incubated with SH3 (5 μm for Y4W-P40 and 15 μm for RI-Y4W-P40) for 15 min in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and ligand-induced changes of Trp fluorescence of SH3 were measured at 350 nm in a cuvette. The Kd values were obtained using a four-parameter non-linear regression analysis as previously described (16Santamaria F. Wu Z. Boulègue C. Pál G. Lu W. J. Mol. Recognit. 2003; 16: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Competition binding kinetics was carried out at 25 °C on a Biacore T100 SPR instrument using an N-terminally uncapped p53(15–29) peptide immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (17 resonance units (RUs)). The buffer was 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4. 50 nm synMDM2 or 100 nm synMDMX was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with varying concentrations of peptide and injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 2 min, followed by a 4-min dissociation. The concentration of unbound synMDM2 or synMDMX in solution was deduced, based on p53 association RU values, from a calibration curve established by RU measurements of different concentrations of synMDM2 or synMDMX injected alone. Non-linear regression analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 4 to give rise to Kd values using the equation, Kd = [peptide][MDM2]/[complex]. For Kd measurements of CAI and RI-CAI with CCA, steady state binding kinetics of CAI (0.78–100 μm) and RI-CAI (6.25–800 μm) on oxidized CCA (500 RUs) immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip were obtained. Direct protein-peptide interactions were quantified at 25 °C using a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. A typical experiment involved injection of 30 aliquots (8 μl each) of 200 μm peptide solution (prepared in PBS containing 0.1 mm TCEP and 0.01% NaN3) into a 1.4-ml ITC cell containing 15 μm protein solution in the same buffer. For background subtraction, a reference set of injections of peptide was made in a separate experiment into the buffer alone. The integrated interaction heat values were analyzed using the Origin 7.0-based ITC fitting software provided by MicroCal, yielding the binding affinity, stoichiometry, and other thermodynamic parameters. GST-MDM2(1–150) and His6-p53 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by binding to glutathione-agarose and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads under non-denaturing conditions. ELISA plates were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml His6-p53 in PBS for 16 h. After washing with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), the plates were blocked with PBS plus 5% nonfat dry milk plus 0.1% Tween 20 (PBSMT) for 30 min. GST-MDM2(1–150) (5 μg/ml) was mixed with compounds in PBSMT plus 10% glycerol plus 10 mm dithiothreitol and added to the wells. The plates were washed with PBST after incubation for 1 h at room temperature and incubation with MDM2 antibody 5B10 in PBSMT for 1 h, followed by washing and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody for 1 h. The plates were developed by incubation with TMB peroxidase substrate (KPL) and measured by absorbance at 450 nm. All NMR experiments were performed at 293 K on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer operating at a 1H resonance frequency of 499.754 MHz. The peptides were dissolved at 5 mm in d3-trifluoroethanol/H2O co-solvent (1:1) with 10% D2O, pH 4.4. The homonuclear DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were collected using standard protocols (21Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar). TOCSY spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 80 ms, whereas mixing times of 80 and 200 ms were used for NOESY experiments and evaluation of spin diffusion effects. All data were processed with the program NMRPipe (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). The spin systems of all residues were identified using the Wüthrich strategy (23Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), aided by the CARA software (24Keller R. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. 1st Ed. CANTINA Verlag, Goldau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). Structure calculation was carried out using a standalone ATNOS/CANDID program (25Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), combined with the molecular modeling software XPLOR-NIH (26Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). A total of 234 (RI-p53(15–29)) or 318 (p53(15–29)) meaningful nuclear Overhauser effect upper distance constraints, extracted from a total of 525 (RI-p53(15–29)) or 642 (p53(15–29)) assigned NOESY cross-peaks, were used as input for the final structure calculation by XPLOR. 20 conformers with the lowest residual target function values from energy-refined cycles were superimposed in the figure. Crystals were grown in 24-well plates at room temperature using the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method. 1 μl of 10 mg/ml CCA in water was mixed with an equal volume of crystallization solution and equilibrated against 800 μl of mother liquor consisting of 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.8 m sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, and 0.8 m potassium phosphate monobasic. Crystals were soaked briefly in reservoir solution plus 30% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant and subsequently flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected using a rotating anode x-ray generator Rigaku-MSC Micromax 7 and a Raxis-4++ image plate detector (at the X-ray Crystallography Core Facility, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD) and were integrated and scaled with the HKL2000 package (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method with the program Phaser from the CCP4 suite (28Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Molecular graphics were generated using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA). The N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 encompasses the sequence F19S20D21L22W23K24L25L26 (critical residues highlighted in boldface type) minimally required for effective MDM2 binding (14Kussie P.H.

Biophys. 2000; 381: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The p53 transactivation domain itself is unstructured in solution (34Wells M. Tidow H. Rutherford T.J. Markwick P. Jensen M.R. Mylonas E. Svergun D.I. Blackledge M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5762-5767Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the N-terminal domain of MDM2, however, it acquires a right-handed amphipathic α-helical structure where Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26 bury their hydrophobic side chains inside the p53-binding cavity of MDM2 (14Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). We recently identified PMI (TSFAEYWNLLSP) by phage display, a potent, dual specific peptide inhibitor with low nanomolar binding affinity for both MDM2 and MDMX (15Pazgier M. Liu M. Zou G. Yuan W. Li C. Li C. Li J. Monbo J. Zella D. Tarasov S.G. Lu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4665-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 1A is the synMDM2-PMI complex superimposed with the co-crystal structure of recombinant MDM2(17–125) and p53(15–29) (14Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The synthetic and recombinant MDM2 proteins are nearly identical, as evidenced by a root mean square deviation of 0.7 Å between their equivalent Cα atoms. The functionally critical residues, Phe3, Trp7, and Leu10 of PMI, are topologically equivalent to Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26 of p53 in bound states. Notably, we crystallized synMDM2 in complex with p53(15–29) but failed to crystallize the same protein with RI-p53(15–29) (data not shown). Shown in Fig. 1B are the CD spectra of 100 μm p53(15–29) and RI-p53(15–29) obtained at room temperature. Both peptides were unstructured in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. However, in the presence of the α-helix-inducing agent trifluoroethanol (TFE) (60%, v/v), although p53(15–29) became only partially ordered, the retro-inverso isomer readily adopted a distinct left-handed α-helix, as indicated by double maxima at 208 and 222 nm and a strong negative peak at 195 nm. We further characterized both peptides in 50% TFE by NMR spectroscopy at 20 °C. The solution structures of p53(15–29) and RI-p53(15–29) were determined by the standard two-dimensional homonuclear methods using TOCSY, NOESY, and DQ-COSY spectra (23Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, except for a less-than-a-full-turn α-helical segment, p53(15–29) is largely disordered, particularly at its N terminus. By contrast, the retro-inverso isomer is well structured, adopting a somewhat irregular left-handed helix expected for d-peptides, fully consistent with the CD spectroscopic data. Clearly, p53(15–29) and RI-p53(15–29) differ not only in the handedness of helix but also in helical propensity; the d-peptide has a significantly stronger propensity to form a left-handed helix than the l-pepti"
https://openalex.org/W2052353444,"P2X(7) receptors (P2X(7)R) are ATP-gated calcium-permeable cationic channels structurally unique among the P2X family by their much longer intracellular C-terminal tail. P2X(7)Rs show several unusual biophysical properties, in particular marked facilitation of currents and leftward shift in agonist affinity in response to repeated or prolonged agonist applications. We previously found the facilitation at rat P2X(7)R resulted from a Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent process and a distinct calcium-independent process. However, P2X(7)Rs show striking species differences; thus, this study compared the properties of ATP-evoked facilitation of currents in HEK293 cells transiently expressing the human or rat P2X(7)R as well as rat/human, human/rat chimeric, and mutated P2X(7)Rs. Facilitation at the human P2X(7)R was 5-fold slower than at the rat P2X(7)R. Facilitation did not resulting from an increase of receptor addressing the plasma membrane. We found the human P2X(7)R shows only calcium-independent facilitation with no evidence for calmodulin-dependent processes, nor does it contain the novel 1-5-16 calmodulin binding domain present in the C terminus of rat P2X(7)R. Replacement of three critical residues of this binding domain from the rat into the human P2X(7)R (T541I, C552S, and G559V) reconstituted the Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent facilitation, leaving the calcium-independent facilitation unaltered. The leftward shift in the ATP concentration-response curve with repeated agonist applications appears to be a property of the calcium-independent facilitation process because it was not altered in any of the chimeric or mutated P2X(7)Rs. The absence of Ca(2+)-dependent facilitation at the human P2X(7)R may represent a protective adaptation of the innate immune response in which P2X(7)R plays significant roles."
https://openalex.org/W2034251131,"When unfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causing ER stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR) responds rapidly to induce a transcriptional program that functions to alleviate the stress. However, under extreme conditions, when UPR activation is not sufficient to alleviate ER stress, the stress may persist long term. Very little is known about how the cell responds to persistent ER stress that is not resolved by the immediate activation of the UPR. We show that Hog1 MAP kinase becomes phosphorylated during the late stage of ER stress and helps the ER regain homeostasis. Although Hog1 is well known to function in osmotic stress and cell wall integrity pathways, we show that the activation mechanism for Hog1 during ER stress is distinct from both of these pathways. During late stage ER stress, upon phosphorylation, Hog1 translocates into the nucleus and regulates gene expression. Subsequently, Hog1 returns to the cytoplasm, where its phosphorylation levels remain high. From its cytoplasmic location, Hog1 contributes to the activation of autophagy by enhancing the stability of Atg8, a critical autophagy protein. Thus, Hog1 coordinates a multifaceted response to persistent ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W2067485891,"Speedy TCR Transgenic Mouse Manufacture T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice are one of the most useful and ubiquitous tools of the immunologist. This is because the majority of T cells that develop in these mice express T cell receptors with known antigen specificity, and thus the mice can be used to study antigen-specific immune responses. The downside of TCR transgenic mice is that they can be difficult and time-consuming to generate and the antigen specificities of their T cells are often not physiologically relevant. Kirak et al. (p. 243 ) now describe the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create TCR transgenic mice with specificity for antigens known to be important in the immune response against the parasite Toxoplasma gondii . This method generates mice with greater ease and speed than conventional TCR transgenic mice and can be applied to generate mice with T cells specific to antigens from a variety of infectious diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2008722691,"Carriers of germ line mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 have an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers; missense mutations have, however, been difficult to assess for disease association. Here we have used a biophysical approach to classify these variants. We established an assay for measuring the thermodynamic stability of the BRCA1 BRCT domains and investigated the effects of 36 missense mutations. The mutations show a range of effects. Some do not change the stability, whereas others destabilize the protein by as much as 6 kcal mol(-1); one-third of the mutants could not be expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli, and we conclude that these destabilize the protein by an even greater amount. We tested several computer algorithms for their ability to predict the mutant effects and found that by grouping them into two classes (destabilizing by less than or more than 2.2 kcal mol(-1)), the algorithms could predict the stability changes. Importantly, with the exception of the few mutants located in the binding site, none showed a significant reduction in affinity for phosphorylated substrate. These results indicate that despite very large losses in stability, the integrity of the structure is not compromised by the mutations. Thus, the majority of mutations cause loss of function by reducing the proportion of BRCA1 molecules that are in the folded state and increasing the proportion of molecules that are unfolded. Consequently, small molecule stabilization of the structure could be a generally applicable preventative therapeutic strategy for rescuing many BRCA1 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1995870500,"Understanding the fundamental role of soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes in membrane fusion requires knowledge of the spatiotemporal dynamics of their assembly. We visualized complexin (cplx), a cytosolic protein that binds assembled SNARE complexes, during single exocytic events in live cells. We found that cplx appeared briefly during full fusion. However, a truncated version of cplx containing only the SNARE-complex binding region persisted at fusion sites for seconds and caused fusion to be transient. Resealing pores with the mutant cplx only partially released transmitter and lipid probes, indicating that the pores are narrow and not purely lipidic in structure. Depletion of cplx similarly caused secretory cargo to be retained. These data suggest that cplx is recruited at a late step in exocytosis and modulates fusion pores composed of SNARE complexes."

IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, down-regulates proinflammatory cytokines and suppresses the immune response, leading to a rapid progression from HIV-1 infection to AIDS. Nine clades of HIV-1 are responsible for the majority of infections worldwide. Recent studies demonstrate that different HIV-1 clades have biological differences in relation to transmission, replication, and disease progression. In this study, we show that the cysteine to serine mutation at position 31, found in >90% of HIV-1 clade C Tat proteins, results in a marked decrease in IL-10 production in monocytes compared with clade B Tat. Additionally, the C31S mutation found in C Tat is responsible for the inability of these Tat proteins to produce high IL-10 levels in monocytes due to its inability to induce intracellular calcium flux through L-type calcium channels. Moreover, we show that p38α/p38β and phosphoinositide 3-kinase are crucial to Tat-induced IL-10 production. These findings provide further evidence that HIV-1 clades differ in their biological properties that may impact HIV-1 pathogenesis and disease progression.

In addition to its primary role as a transcriptional activator of viral gene expression, Tat is actively released from unruptured, HIV-1-infected cells and is detectable in ex vivo culture supernatants and in the serum of HIV-1 infected individuals (1Westendorp M.O.

Most exogenous Tat studies use a truncated 86-residue HIV-1 clade B Tat with few studies examining the functions of other clades or isotypes (3Campbell G.R. Loret E.P. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 50Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, these studies have shown that exogenous B Tat induces the production of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) from monocytes and macrophages (4Badou A.

IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by a wide variety of cells including monocytes, macrophages, T cells, natural killer cells, and B cells (13Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R. Coffman R.L. O'Garra A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 683-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (5224) Google Scholar) that down-regulates major histocompatibility complex class II (13Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R. Coffman R.L. O'Garra A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 683-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (5224) Google Scholar) and inhibits T cell proliferation while reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Elevated IL-10 levels are found in individuals with rapid progression to AIDS (14Stylianou E. Aukrust P. Kvale D. Müller F. Frøland S.S. Clin. Exp.

APMIS. 2006; 114: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in samples from patients chronically infected with HIV, blocking the IL-10/IL-10 receptor pathway in vitro using specific antibodies enhanced CD4+ T cell responses (14Stylianou E.

Therefore, maintaining low levels of IL-10 may slow HIV-1 disease progression.Recent studies have shown that HIV-1 clades possess biological differences in relation to transmission, replication, and disease progression (18Bhoopat L.

Fawzi W. Hunter D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2006; 42: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). HIV-1 clade C accounts for 50% of infections worldwide and has a full-length 101-residue Tat protein. 90% of sequenced HIV-1 clade C Tat possess a C31S mutation not found in clade B Tat that disrupts the 30C-C motif (21Ranga U. Shankarappa R. Siddappa N.B. Ramakrishna L. Nagendran R. Mahalingam M. Mahadevan A. Jayasuryan N. Satishchandra P. Shankar S.K. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2586-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This motif is essential for the induction of a Ca2+ flux in, and chemotaxis of, monocytes and the induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Conversely, disruption of this motif actually increases its trans-activational activity (6Contreras X. Bennasser Y. Chazal N. Moreau M. Leclerc C. Tkaczuk J. Bahraoui E. Virology. 2005; 332: 316-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Park I.W. Wang J.F. Groopman J.E. Blood. 2001; 97: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Campbell G.R.

To date, no study has assessed the capacity of different full length HIV-1 Tat clades to induce IL-10 production in monocytes. In this study, we compared the abilities of HIV-1 clade C Tat and the long form of clade B Tat (22Campbell G.R. Watkins J.D. Esquieu D. Pasquier E. Loret E.P. Spector S.A. J. Biol.

In this study, we show that clade C Tat has a reduced ability to induce IL-10 production in monocytes.DISCUSSIONIL-10 plays an important role in HIV-1 infection and replication (38Ancuta P. Bakri Y.

Frøland S.S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 116: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 15Ameglio F. Cordiali Fei P. Solmone M. Bonifati C. Prignano G. Giglio A. Caprilli F. Gentili G.

Contreras X. Xavier C. Moreau M. Marc M. Le Clerc C. Catherine L. Badou A. Abdallah B. Bahraoui E. J. Soc. Biol. 2001; 195: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Most research on HIV-1 Tat use a peptide corresponding to the first exon (72 residues) or a truncated 86-residue form of the clade B TatHXB2 (24Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 43Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S.F. Doran E.R. Rafalski J.A.

Nature. 1985; 313: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). However, the majority of Tat proteins sequenced from clinical isolates possess the longer 101-residue form of Tat, which has an extra 14 residues located at its C terminus (24Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we have shown that these 14 residues contribute to a greater trans-activational ability combined with a reduced ability to induce apoptosis of CD4+ T cells (22Campbell G.R. Watkins J.D. Esquieu D. Pasquier E. Loret E.P. Spector S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38376-38382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). HIV-1 clade C accounts for >50% of infections worldwide (44Hemelaar J. Gouws E. Ghys P.D. Osmanov S. AIDS. 2006; 20: W13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and is unique among group M viruses, in that they have lower replicative fitness in PBMC, which may be associated with slower disease progression (45Tebit D.M. Nankya I. Arts E.J. Gao Y. AIDS Rev. 2007; 9: 75-87PubMed Google Scholar); thus, understanding this clade is important in understanding HIV-1 pathogenesis. 90% of clade C viruses possess a C31S substitution in the cysteine-rich region of Tat (21Ranga U. Shankarappa R. Siddappa N.B. Ramakrishna L. Nagendran R. Mahalingam M. Mahadevan A. Jayasuryan N. Satishchandra P. Shankar S.K. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2586-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), disrupting the 30C-C-motif. We have shown previously that the C31S mutation found in clade C Tat renders it unable to bind chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2b (CCR2b) and fails to induce a transient calcium flux and activate signaling modules that regulate monocyte chemotaxis (27Campbell G.R. Watkins J.D. Singh K.K. Loret E.P. Spector S.A. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5919-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, clade C Tat is unable to up-regulate CXCR4 on the surface of CD4+ T cells through a CCR2b-dependent mechanism (46Campbell G.R. Loret E.P. Spector S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1681-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), while having no impact upon its ability to trans-activate at low concentrations (27Campbell G.R. Watkins J.D. Singh K.K. Loret E.P. Spector S.A. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5919-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Opi S. Péloponèse Jr., J.M. Esquieu D. Watkins J. Campbell G. De Mareuil J. Jeang K.T. Yirrell D.L. Kaleebu P. Loret E.P. Vaccine. 2004; 22: 3105-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, in this trans-activation model, Tat is added as an exogenous protein that must traverse the cell membrane before it can bind the trans-activation responsive element and trans-activate HIV-1 long terminal repeat gene expression. A study using endogenously produced Tat showed that clade C Tat displayed higher affinities for both the trans-activation responsive element and for the positive transcription elongation factor b complex than clade B Tat and displayed a greater trans-activation potential (23Desfosses Y. Solis M. Sun Q. Grandvaux N. Van Lint C. Burny A. Gatignol A. Wainberg M.A. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9180-9191Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that the serine residues in Tat are phosphorylated by a cyclin-dependent kinase-2 mechanism and that this phosphorylation is important for HIV-1 transcription and the activation of integrated HIV-1 provirus (47Ammosova T. Berro R. Jerebtsova M. Jackson A. Charles S. Klase Z. Southerland W. Gordeuk V.R. Kashanchi F. Nekhai S. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 78Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is possible that the C31S mutation found in clade C Tat gives it a potential new phosphorylation site, augmenting its trans-activational activity. Moreover, the C31S mutation may have other functions that have not yet been identified.In this study, we explored the ability of clade C and clade B Tat to up-regulate IL-10 from monocytes. We confirmed and expanded previously published findings that B Tat up-regulates IL-10 in monocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner (4Badou A. Bennasser Y. Moreau M. Leclerc C. Benkirane M. Bahraoui E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10551-10562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 5Bennasser Y. Bahraoui E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Gee K. Angel J.B. Mishra S. Blahoianu M.A. Kumar A. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also show that a clade C Tat protein lacking Cys31 induces significantly less IL-10 secretion than one possessing Cys31. The aforementioned studies on IL-10 and B Tat also demonstrated that, without traversing the cell membrane, B Tat acts through a surface receptor/channel on human monocytes to induce a [Ca2+]i flux that regulates IL-10 transcription through calmodulin and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II-activated p38 MAPK that activates the downstream cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 and Sp-1 transcription factors (5Bennasser Y. Bahraoui E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Gee K. Angel J.B. Mishra S. Blahoianu M.A. Kumar A. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that the Tat-induced [Ca2+]i flux essential for IL-10 production is extracellular in origin and is dependent upon CaL channels (27Campbell G.R. Watkins J.D. Singh K.K. Loret E.P. Spector S.A. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5919-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Different regions of Tat have been implicated in the interactions with surface proteins: the first nine residues in the N terminus of Tat with CD26, the 78RGD motif with adhesion molecule receptors, mainly integrins such as α5β1 and αvβ3, the basic region with membrane lipids and vascular endothelial factor receptors and the 30C-C motif with CCR2b (48Albini A. Benelli R. Giunciuglio D. Cai T. Mariani G. Ferrini S. Noonan D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15895-15900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N terminus and basic regions of Tat93In and Tat96Bw are identical and both possess a R78Q mutation that disrupts the 78RGD motif. However, these two Tat proteins do differ in that Tat96Bw possesses an intact 30C-C motif, whereas Tat93In has a C31S mutation (Fig. 1).A previous study reported no calcium involvement in Tat-induced IL-10 transcription (4Badou A. Bennasser Y. Moreau M. Leclerc C. Benkirane M. Bahraoui E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10551-10562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This study monitored the intracellular calcium flux for 30 min using microspectrofluorimetry with images captured every 5 s, while our study observed the intracellular calcium flux over 3 min using real time flow cytometry. Using this method, we detected a rapid and transient calcium flux following B Tat treatment that is consistent with other studies using similar methods (5Bennasser Y. Bahraoui E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Bennasser Y. Yamina B. Contreras X. Xavier C. Moreau M. Marc M. Le Clerc C. Catherine L. Badou A. Abdallah B. Bahraoui E. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15895-15900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that was possibly missed using a time-lapse method. Our results also show that CaL and PI3K inhibitors reduce the ability of clade B Tat to induce IL-10 production in monocytes. Together, these suggest that extracellularly sourced calcium is required for TatHXB2 to induce IL-10 production from monocytes. However, Tat93In, although inducing significantly less IL-10 transcription than B TatHXB2, was still able to significantly up-regulate IL-10 despite its inability to induce a measurable [Ca2+]i flux. This may be explained by the ability of exogenous, soluble Tat to penetrate cells and activate the transcription factor nuclear factor κ-light chain enhancer of activated B cells either directly or through upstream effector kinases leading to the production of many cytokines, including IL-10 (5Bennasser Y. Bahraoui E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 49Conant K. Ma M. Nath A. Major E.O. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Cota-Gomez A.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 2872-2880PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an alternative pathway by which Tat may up-regulate IL-10 production. Alternatively, it is possible that Tat93In induces a [Ca2+]i flux independently of the 30C-C motif, but this flux is too small, too rapid, or occurs much later than 200 s to be detected by our methods, as demonstrated by the inhibition of Tat93In-induced IL-10 production from monocytes by the highly specific nimodipine and also by stimulation in Ca2+-free media.We examined the role of p38α/p38β MAPK and class I PI3K in Tat-induced IL-10 production from monocytes using small, cell-permeable chemical inhibitors according to current recommendations (35Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that both p38α/p38β and the calcium-dependent class I PI3K are crucial to Tat-induction of IL-10 in monocytes. Small, cell-permeable chemical inhibitors have the serious limitation in that many possess an inherent lack of specificity. However, following the guidelines specified in Bain et al. (35Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar), we addressed the role of specific kinases in Tat-induced IL-10 production by using inhibitors that are selective for specific kinases and in parallel with another inhibitor that interacts with the same target kinase in a different manner with little overlap in nontarget inhibition. Despite their lack of specificity, if used correctly, these small cell-permeable chemical inhibitors do have advantages over small interfering RNA. The first is that the inhibitory effect on the cell occurs within minutes. In contrast, small interfering RNA has the disadvantage that the target has been “knocked down” for 18 h or more before Tat treatment. Therefore, the effects that we may observe are oftentimes indirect and result from long term alterations in gene expression. Secondly, small interfering RNA are recognized by the Toll-like receptor 8 and retinoic acid-inducible protein 1 that are present in monocytes (53Goodchild A. Nopper N. King A. Doan T. Tanudji M. Arndt G.M. Poidinger M. Rivory L.P. Passioura T. BMC Immunol. 2009; 10: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This recognition triggers downstream signaling via Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domains activating the interferon regulatory factor, nuclear factor κ-light chain enhancer of activated B cells and MAPK pathways leading to the expression of interferon, proinflammatory cytokines, as well as IL-10 (54Saruta M.

Moreover, higher concentrations than those present in the plasma may be found in lymphoid tissue, where productively infected cells are most frequent and where Tat may act locally after secretion from HIV-1-infected cells (2Xiao H. Neuveut C. Tiffany H.L. Benkirane M. Rich E.A. Murphy P.M. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 11466-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).In summary, we observed a differential effect of HIV-1 clade B and clade C Tat on the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in monocytes. B Tat induces IL-10 production from monocytes through a calcium-dependent mechanism that involves the 30C-C motif. The C31S mutation found in the majority of clade C variants abrogates its ability to induce a measurable [Ca2+]i flux and is responsible for the marked decrease in IL-10 production. Furthermore, we also show that p38α/p38β and class I PI3K are crucially involved in clade B Tat-induced IL-10 production. These data demonstrate the importance of studying the regulation of cytokines and chemokines by different HIV-1 clades and the impact that these differences may have on HIV-1 pathogenesis and disease progression.

In addition to its primary role as a transcriptional activator of viral gene expression, Tat is actively released from unruptured, HIV-1-infected cells and is detectable in ex vivo culture supernatants and in the serum of HIV-1 infected individuals (1Westendorp M.O.

Most exogenous Tat studies use a truncated 86-residue HIV-1 clade B Tat with few studies examining the functions of other clades or isotypes (3Campbell G.R. Loret E.P. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 50Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, these studies have shown that exogenous B Tat induces the production of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) from monocytes and macrophages (4Badou A.

SNAREs generally consist of one or two core domains that can form a four-helix bundle with other SNARE core domains. Some SNAREs, such as syntaxin target-SNAREs and longin vesicular-SNAREs, have independent, folded N-terminal domains that can interact with their respective SNARE core domains and thereby affect the kinetics of SNARE complex formation. This autoinhibition mechanism is believed to regulate the role of the longin VAMP7/TI-VAMP in neuronal morphogenesis. Here we use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the longin-SNARE core domain interaction for VAMP7. Using complete backbone resonance assignments, chemical shift perturbations analysis, and hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments, we conclusively show that VAMP7 adopts a preferentially closed conformation in solution. Taken together, the closed conformation of longins is conserved, in contrast to the syntaxin family of SNAREs for which mixtures of open and closed states have been observed.

https://openalex.org/W2111025039,"Stable epigenetic silencing of p16(INK4a) is a common event in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, which is associated with abnormal cell proliferation and liberation from cell cycle arrest. Understanding the early epigenetic events in silencing p16(INK4a) expression may illuminate a prognostic strategy to block HCC development. Toward this end, we created a reprogram cell model by the fusion mouse HCC cells with mouse embryonic stem cells, in which the ES-Hepa hybrids forfeited HCC cell characteristics along with reactivation of the silenced p16(INK4a). HCC characteristics, in terms of gene expression pattern and tumorigenic potential, was restored upon induced differentiation of these reprogrammed ES-Hepa hybrids. The histone methylation pattern relative to p16(INK4a) silencing during differentiation of the ES-Hepa hybrids was analyzed. H3K27 trimethylation at the p16(INK4a) promoter region, occurring in the early onset of p16(INK4a) silencing, was followed by H3K9 dimethylation at later stages. During the induced differentiation of the ES-Hepa hybrids, H3K4 di- and trimethylations were maintained at high levels during the silencing of p16(INK4a), strongly suggesting that H3K4 methylation events did not cause the silencing of p16(INK4a). Our results suggested that the enrichment of H3K27 trimethylation, independent of H3K9 dimethylation, trimethylation, and DNA methylation, was an early event in the silencing of p16(INK4a) during the tumor development. This unique chromatin pattern may be a heritable marker of epigenetic regulation for p16(INK4a) silencing during the developmental process of hepatocellular carcinogenesis."

This issue was addressed in cells expressing liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) by real time multiphoton laser scanning microscopy of novel fluorescent VLC-PUFAs containing a conjugated tetraene fluorophore near the carboxyl group and natural methylene-interrupted n-3 or n-6 grouping. The fluorescent VLC-PUFAs mimicked many properties of their native nonfluorescent counterparts, including uptake, distribution, and metabolism in living cells. The unesterified fluorescent VLC-PUFAs distributed either equally in nuclei versus cytoplasm (22-carbon n-3 VLC-PUFA) or preferentially to cytoplasm (20-carbon n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs). L-FABP bound fluorescent VLC-PUFA with affinity and specificity similar to their nonfluorescent natural counterparts. Regarding n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA, L-FABP expression enhanced uptake into the cell and cytoplasm, selectively altered the pattern of fluorescent n-6 and n-3 VLC-PUFA distribution in cytoplasm versus nuclei, and preferentially distributed fluorescent VLC-PUFA into nucleoplasm versus nuclear envelope, especially for the 22-carbon n-3 VLC-PUFA, correlating with its high binding by L-FABP.

This possibility is supported by the fact that L-FABP binds n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs with high affinity (Kd ∼10−8 to 10−7 m) and protects VLC-PUFAs (e.g. 20:4n-6) from intracellular peroxidation (1Norris A.W.

However, the conjugated tetraene or pentaene fluorophores in these probes are localized in the methyl-terminal half of the fatty acid, a position not consistent with the methylene-interrupted n-3 or n-6 grouping present in naturally occurring n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs (20Kuklev D.V.

Likewise, the pattern of L-FABP affinities for n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA (20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3) established by displacement of parinaric acids does not reflect that established by other assays (1Norris A.W.

As shown here, these fluorescent VLC-PUFAs were taken up and metabolized to esterified lipids similarly as their nonfluorescent counterparts. MPLSM real time imaging and quantitative analysis of n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA uptake and intracellular distribution revealed that the VLC-PUFAs were rapidly taken up and quickly targeted to nuclei, nuclear envelope membranes, and nucleoplasm of living cells. These studies are important because they provide for the first time a dynamic visual yet quantitative approach not available for native VLC-PUFAs for the purpose of examining not only 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3, and 22:6n-3 whole cell uptake kinetics but also kinetics involving the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, nuclear envelope, and total nucleus in real time. Finally, it was shown that L-FABP regulated the uptake, intracellular distribution, and metabolism of the fluorescent VLC-PUFAs in living cells.DISCUSSIONThe uptake, intracellular transport, and intracellular targeting of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids into nuclei are increasingly well understood (8McArthur M.J.

In contrast, almost nothing is known regarding these aspects of n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA dynamics or the factors that regulate VLC-PUFA uptake, metabolism, and intracellular distribution in living cells.

Kinetic analysis at early time points indicated that the fluorescent n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs were taken up very rapidly, appearing in the cytoplasm with essentially the same kinetics as in the whole cell, i.e. detectable in <1 min, consistent with the known rapid transbilayer transport previously shown for many other types of fatty acids (8McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1371-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the half-times for fluorescent n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA uptake were similar to those of naturally occurring fatty acids, in marked contrast to the much more rapid uptake of earlier fluorescent PUFAs (t½ of 7–10 s) (23Schroeder F.

Finally, the specificity of fluorescent n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA uptake (especially with increasing time of incubation) better mimicked that of their nonfluorescent counterparts, again in contrast to that observed with earlier fluorescent PUFAs such as the cis- and trans-parinaric acids (23Schroeder F. Jefferson J.R. Powell D. Incerpi S. Woodford J.K. Colles S.M. Myers-Payne S. Emge T. Hubbell T. Moncecchi D. Prows D.R. Heyliger C.E. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1997; 167: 51-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). trans-Parinaric acid uptake is faster and has 40-fold lower Km values than that of cis-parinaric acid, opposite to the specificity for nonfluorescent counterparts (23Schroeder F. Jefferson J.R. Powell D. Incerpi S. Woodford J.K. Colles S.M. Myers-Payne S. Emge T. Hubbell T. Moncecchi D. Prows D.R. Heyliger C.E. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1997; 167: 51-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Second, the fluorescent n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA better mimicked the intracellular distribution of nonfluorescent counterparts. At early time points when the fluorescent VLC-PUFAs were primarily unesterified, real time MPLSM imaging showed them distributed as follows: (i) in the cytoplasm both diffusely and punctate consistent with the free VLC-PUFAs bound to cytoplasmic proteins and vesicle membranes, respectively, as has been shown for fluorescent analogues of saturated fatty acids (13Atshaves B.P. McIntosh A.M. Lyuksyutova O.I. Zipfel W. Webb W.W. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30954-30965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); (ii) less so in the nucleus (nuclear envelope membrane > nucleoplasm); and (iii) at longer incubation times the fluorescent VLC-PUFAs were primarily in esterified form and distributed into a variety of membranous structures as well as into lipid droplets. In contrast, earlier nonesterified fluorescent PUFAs with the conjugated tetraene fluorophore in the methyl-terminal region were distributed primarily into bright lipid droplets and diffusely in cytoplasm and less so in nuclei (34Huang H. Starodub O. McIntosh A. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29139-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the intracellular distribution of fluorescent n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA much better reflected that of the native fatty acids.Third, the metabolism of the fluorescent n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs much better represented that of their occurring counterparts than previous fluorescent PUFAs. With increasing incubation time, the fluorescent n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA was more representative of their radiolabeled nonfluorescent counterparts in becoming increasingly esterified to the phospholipids rather than neutral lipids. At early time points, the fluorescent VLC-PUFAS mimicked their radiolabeled VLC-PUFA counterparts in becoming primarily incorporated into PC and less so into PE. Although this was also the case at longer time points (overnight incubation) for fluorescent A5c and E6c as well as their radiolabeled nonfluorescent counterparts (20:4n-6, 20:5n-3), both the fluorescent D7c analogue and its radiolabeled nonfluorescent counterpart (22:6n-3) was esterified more into PE than PC. Overall, these findings were consistent with studies of n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA distribution in esterified lipids of multiple tissues (39Chen C.T. Green J.T. Orr S.K. Bazinet R.P. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2008; 79: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 40Golovko M.Y. Murphy E.J. J.

Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2004; 41: 41-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Finally, both fluorescent n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA analogues as well as their radiolabeled nonfluorescent counterparts were only weakly esterified to the neutral lipids. This finding was due to the CoA thioesters of n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs being poor substrates for diacylglycerol acyltransferase (last step in triglyceride synthesis) and cholesterol acyl-CoA acyltransferase (last step in cholesterol ester synthesis (42Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8755-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar)). In marked contrast, earlier fluorescent PUFA analogues wherein the conjugated polyene fluorophore was localized in the methyl half of the molecule (interrupting/abolishing the normal methylene interruptions present in naturally occurring n-3 and n-6 PUFAs) were either very slowly esterified (3%/day) or esterified nearly equally to phospholipids and neutral lipids, especially at early time points of incubation (22Kuerschner L. Ejsing C.S. Ekroos K. Shevchenko A. Anderson K.I. Thiele C. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24Heyliger C.E. Kheshgi T.J. Murphy E.J. Myers-Payne S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29139-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Finally, it is important to note that very little of the fluorescent n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs were oxidized or photodegraded in the early time frame of the experiments herein because their fluorescence was relatively stable. Similar low degree of oxidation and/or photodestruction was reported for earlier fluorescent PUFA analogues, regardless of where the conjugated fluorescent polyene resided in the molecule (16Huang H. Starodub O. McIntosh A. Atshaves B.P. Woldegiorgis G. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2484-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Kuerschner L. Ejsing C.S. Ekroos K. Shevchenko A. Anderson K.I. Thiele C. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggested that the fluorescent n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs were taken up and remained primarily in unesterified form at early time points, preferentially esterified to phospholipids (not neutral lipids) at longer time points, and relatively stable to oxidation/photodestruction under the conditions of the real time MPLSM imaging studies in living cells used herein.Fourth, L-FABP binding of fluorescent VLC-PUFAs mirrored the natural nonfluorescent counterparts better than earlier fluorescent PUFAs (1Norris A.W. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 646-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Frolov A. Cho T.H. Murphy E.J. Schroeder F.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). L-FABP bound all three fluorescent VLC-PUFAs with high affinity and reflected the specificities for their nonfluorescent counterparts (1Norris A.W. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 646-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Frolov A. Cho T.H. Murphy E.J. Schroeder F.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The high affinities exhibited by L-FABP for both the fluorescent and naturally occurring n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs reflected the natural distribution of the endogenous bound native nonfluorescent fatty acids (32Murphy E.J. Edmondson R.D. Russell D.H. Colles S. Schroeder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as follows. (i) the n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs included over 40% of the endogenous L-FABP-bound fatty acid, consistent with the higher affinity of L-FABP for such fatty acids than saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids. (ii) 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 included 25 and 2% of the total endogenous bound fatty acid, whereas 22:5n-3 was not detectable, consistent with the relative composition of hepatic unesterified fatty acid pool (32Murphy E.J. Edmondson R.D. Russell D.H. Colles S. Schroeder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 42Jump D.B. J. Biol.

In contrast, earlier fluorescent PUFAs with conjugated polyene fluorophore in the methyl-terminal region (e.g. parinaric acids) do not interact with L-FABP in the same manner as naturally occurring n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA (20:4n-6, 22:6n-3). For example, although several studies previously established that L-FABP has higher or equal affinity for 22:6n-3 than 20:4n-6, parinaric acid displacement assays showed the opposite (1Norris A.W. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 646-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Zimmerman A.W. Veerkamp J.H. Kleinfeld A.M.

L-FABP exhibits higher affinity for the straight chain trans-parinaric acid (saturated analogue) as compared with the kinked chain cis-parinaric acid (unsaturated analogue), opposite to the known preference of L-FABP for kinked chain unsaturated fatty acids versus straight chain saturated fatty acids (8McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1371-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Frolov A. Cho T.H. Murphy E.J. Schroeder F.

Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 175-226Google Scholar). Thus, the pattern of L-FABP affinities for the fluorescent n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs, but not that established with parinaric acid displacement assays, better reflects that of naturally occurring n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFA.With regard to specificity of L-FABP for VLC-PUFA binding, the cytosolic fatty acid-binding protein family is composed of more than a dozen members with overlapping specificity for binding a broad variety of fatty acids. The rodent FABPs bind n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs in the following order of affinities: L-FABP, H-FABPs ≫ intestinal type FABP, adipocyte-type FABP ≫ cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins I and II (18Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Zimmerman A.W. Veerkamp J.H. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7197-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The liver L-FABP has high affinity for VLC-PUFAs (as compared with most other FABP family members), and it is highly expressed in tissues active in fatty acid uptake and metabolism (i.e. liver, intestine, kidney). L-FABP also enhances the uptake/metabolism of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (43Atshaves B.P. Martin G.G. Hostetler H.A. McIntosh A.L. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is tempting to speculate that differences in binding affinities to L-FABP may account for the differences in predominant products formed by the n-3 and n-6 PUFA synthetic pathways, there is as yet no evidence that this is the case (1Norris A.W. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 646-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, however, by binding long chain fatty acid peroxidation products of PUFAs, the L-FABP (more so than other FABPs tested) modulates availability of these PUFAs to intracellular oxidative pathways and controls the amount of reactive oxygen species released within the cell (19Ek B.A. Cistola D.P. Hamilton J.A. Kaduce T.L. Spector A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 59"

In cerebellar granule cells, they often form receptors together with α1 and/or α6 subunits. We were interested in determining the architecture of receptors containing both subunits. We predefined the subunit arrangement of several different GABAA receptor pentamers by concatenation. These receptors composed of α1, α6, β3, and δ subunits were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Currents elicited in response to GABA were determined in the presence and absence of 3α,21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one (THDOC) or ethanol, or currents were elicited by 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]-pyridin-3-ol (THIP). Several subunit configurations formed active channels. We therefore conclude that δ can assume multiple positions in a receptor pentamer made up of α1, α6, β3, and δ subunits. The different receptors differ in their functional properties. Functional expression of one receptor type was only evident in the combined presence of the neurosteroid THDOC with the channel agonist GABA. Most, but not all, receptors active with GABA/THDOC responded to THIP. None of the receptors was modulated by ethanol concentrations up to 30 mm. Several observations point to a preferred position of δ subunits between two α subunits in α1α6β3δ receptors.

Familial cases of ALS (FALS) constitute ∼10% of all ALS cases, and mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is found in 15–20% of FALS. SOD1 mutations confer a toxic gain of unknown function to the protein that specifically targets the motor neurons in the cortex and the spinal cord. We have previously shown that the autosomal dominant Legs at odd angles (Loa) mutation in cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (Dync1h1) delays disease onset and extends the life span of transgenic mice harboring human mutant SOD1G93A. In this study we provide evidence that despite the lack of direct interactions between mutant SOD1 and either mutant or wild-type cytoplasmic dynein, the Loa mutation confers significant reductions in the amount of mutant SOD1 protein in the mitochondrial matrix. Moreover, we show that the Loa mutation ameliorates defects in mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential observed in SOD1G93A motor neuron mitochondria.

Formation of intracellular protein aggregates in motor neurons is a common characteristic of all ALS cases and is also observed in SOD1 transgenic mouse models. Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies have shown that SOD1 and ubiquitin aggregates are present in SOD1-mediated familial ALS cases and their transgenic mouse models and that TDP-43 and ubiquitin aggregates are seen in most ALS inclusions, including sporadic ALS (3Bruijn L.I.

However, mutant SOD1 toxicity could be the result of toxicity of the intracellular aggregates through aberrant chemistry, sequestration of other proteins into the aggregates, proteasome overload, and damage to specific organelles such as mitochondria (3Bruijn L.I.

Furthermore, in vivo experiments involving injection of a neurotracer have shown that transport from muscle to motor neurons is impaired in SOD1G93A mice and that there is an association of dynein with mutant SOD1 aggregates in the motor neurons of these mice (21Ligon L.A.

Two recent studies have reported that there is a direct “gain-of-interaction” between aggregate-prone variants of mutant, but not wild-type, SOD1 (including SOD1G93A), and cytoplasmic dynein in glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown and immunoprecipitation assays and that disruption of cytoplasmic dynein function abolishes this interaction (22Zhang F.

This multisubunit protein complex consists of two homodimerized heavy chains, DYNC1H1, here referred to as DHC, and several intermediates (DYNC1I), here referred to as DIC, light intermediates (DYNC1LI), and light (DYNL) chains (25Pfister K.K.

Dynein function is regulated by another multisubunit protein, dynactin, which through its p150 subunit also plays a significant role as a docking protein for some of the various cargos transported by dynein (30Schroer T.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 759-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that an autosomal dominant point mutation causing F580Y substitution in DHC gives rise to a progressive motor deficit in heterozygous Loa (Dync1h1Loa/+) mice (31Hafezparast M.

In addition, others have shown that the Loa mutation causes γ-motor neuron and proprioceptive sensory neuron degeneration in heterozygous Dync1h1Loa/+ which is thought to be the cause of the phenotype in these mice (34Chen X.J.

Interestingly, when we crossed Dync1h1Loa/+ with SOD1G93A mice to investigate a possible link between dynein and mutant SOD1, the SOD1G93A;Dync1h1Loa/+ progeny from this cross showed a wild-type phenotype with regard to muscle force, motor unit, and motor neuron survival at 120 days when their SOD1G93A littermates exhibited severe defects (17Kieran D.

Moreover, the average lifespan of SOD1G93A;Dync1h1Loa/+ mice increased by 28% compared with their SOD1G93A littermates (p ≤ 0.001). In addition, the Loa allelic mutation Y1055C in Dync1h1Cra1/+ mice has also been shown to delay disease onset and increase the life span of SOD1G93A mice by 14% (36Teuchert M. Fischer D.

Both (34Chen X.J. Levedakou E.N. Millen K.J. Wollmann R.L. Soliven B. Popko B. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14515-14524Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and Ilieva et al. (35Ilieva H.S.

The loss of sensory neurons in Dync1h1Loa/+ mice prompted Ilieva et al. (35Ilieva H.S. Yamanaka K. Malkmus S. Kakinohana O. Yaksh T. Marsala M. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12599-12604Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) to propose that the rescue of SOD1G93A is a result of reduced glutamate excitotoxicity brought about by the loss of the glutamatergic proprioceptive sensory neurons (35Ilieva H.S. Yamanaka K. Malkmus S. Kakinohana O. Yaksh T. Marsala M. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12599-12604Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the Sprawling (Dync1h1Swl1/+) mouse with a G1040-T1043delinsA mutation in the dynein heavy chain shows even greater proprioceptive sensory neuron loss than the Loa, but it is not able to rescue the SOD1G93A phenotype (34Chen X.J.

Moreover, the W1206R mutation in Abnormal rear leg (Arl) mouse, which is allelic to Loa, confers loss of sensory neuron fibers in the Dync1h1Arl/+ mice, but it has no effect on the disease onset or life span in the double mutant SOD1G93A;Dync1h1Arl/+ mice. 3V.

Bostock, G. Schiavo, L. Greensmith, and M. Hafezparast, manuscript in preparation. These findings, therefore, do not support the hypothesis that the protection of motor neurons in SOD1G93A/Dync1h1Loa/+ mice is solely the result of reduced glutamatergic sensory neuron input by the Loa mutation. The above findings do, however, suggest a link between cytoplasmic dynein and SOD1G93A toxicity. In this report we present evidence to suggest that the Loa mutation in dynein affects the subcellular distribution of mutant SOD1 protein in SOD1G93A;Dync1h1Loa/+ mice after, but not before, the onset of the disease. Furthermore, the Loa mutation in dynein weakens the association of SOD1G93A protein with the mitochondria in the cortex of the brain and spinal cord. We also present data showing severe defects in respiration and membrane potential of SOD1G93A mitochondria, which are ameliorated in mitochondria isolated from SOD1G93A;Dync1h1Loa/+ mice. In addition, the results of this study show that there is no direct interaction between dynein and SOD1G93A and that SOD1G93A protein does not disrupt the dynein complex. Congenic heterozygous Dync1h1Loa/+ female mice, maintained on a C57BL/6 (Harlan UK) genetic background, were crossed with male transgenic mice expressing human SOD1G93A, maintained on an F1 (SJL x C57BL/6) genetic background, to produce four genetically distinct groups of littermates: Dync1h1+/+, Dync1h1Loa/+ heterozygote, SOD1G93A hemizygote, and SOD1G93A;Dync1h1Loa/+ double-heterozygote (represented in the figures as +/+, Loa/+, SOD1G93A, and SOD1G93A/Loa, respectively) mice. The SJL mice were purchased from Harlan UK. All mice were identified by genotyping for the Loa mutation in the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene Dync1h1 and the human SOD1 transgene from tail genomic DNA (31Hafezparast M. Klocke R.

The early stage was when the mice showed a body weight loss of less than 10% accompanied by shaky hind limbs; the late stage was characterized by a 10–15% reduction in body weight accompanied by an apparent muscle wasting and paralysis of hind limbs; the end stage was when the mice lost their righting reflex and showed 20% reduction of their body weight compared with that before becoming symptomatic. Mice were killed by a schedule 1 killing, and brains and spinal cords were dissected, washed with appropriate ice-cold buffers, and either used fresh or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. All animal experiments were conducted in accord with the UK Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986). All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS−Ca−Mg) was from Invitrogen; RIPA was from Upstate Biotechnology; protein A-Sepharose 4B beads were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; protein A- and protein B-agarose beads were from Roche Applied Science; proteinase K was from New England Biolabs; BS3 and the BCA protein assay kit were from Pierce. The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse monoclonal anti-dynein intermediate chain 74.1 (generously provided by Dr. K. Pfister, University of Virginia or Santa Cruz, sc-13524), FL-154 rabbit polyclonal anti-SOD1, H-300 rabbit polyclonal anti-dynactin p150Glued, R-325 rabbit polyclonal anti-dynein heavy chain, 20-E8 mouse monoclonal anti-Cox4, C-20 goat polyclonal anti-calnexin, C-15 goat polyclonal anti-TGN38, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-11407, sc-11363, sc-9115, sc-58348, sc-6465, sc-27680, respectively), NCL-SOD1 mouse monoclonal anti-SOD1 (Novo Castra), mouse monoclonal anti-p150Glued (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610473), and mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Upstate Biotechnology, 05-829). Homogenization of the mouse brain or spinal cord tissues and immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out after either the procedure we developed in our laboratories (see “Results”) or as described elsewhere (22Zhang F. Ström A.L. Fukada K. Lee S. Hayward L.J. Zhu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16691-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Brains and spinal cords were homogenized in a range of homogenization buffers (HBs) (see “Results” for details). The homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and their protein contents were determined using the BCA kit. Approximately 2.0 mg of homogenate proteins were cleared by incubation with beads for 1 h with shaking at 4 °C, and the beads then removed by centrifugation. The cleared homogenates were then incubated with a range of different beads (protein G-agarose, protein A-agarose, or protein A-Sepharose 4B beads or TrueBlot™ anti-mouse Ig IP beads from eBioscience) linked with anti-DIC, anti-dynactin p150, or anti-SOD1 antibodies or with anti-hemagglutinin antibody or IgG as the negative control for time periods that varied between 3 h to overnight with shaking at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated complexes on beads were retrieved by brief centrifugation and washed four times with HB and once with water. Protein complexes on beads were resuspended in 1× SDS loading buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting detecting for DIC, DHC, p150, and SOD1. Chemical cross-linking with BS3, the water soluble analogue of disuccinimidyl suberate, was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations and Zhang et al. (22Zhang F. Ström A.L. Fukada K. Lee S. Hayward L.J. Zhu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16691-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A 4.8-ml 5–40% continuous sucrose gradient in PBS−Ca/Mg was established overnight at 4 °C in Beckman Ultra-Clear Centrifuge tubes (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Brains and spinal cords of Dync1h1+/+, Dync1h1Loa/+, SOD1G93A, and SOD1G93A;Dync1h1Loa/+ mice at different postnatal stages were homogenized in PBS−Ca/Mg containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Homogenates were spun at 800 × g for 15 min. Protein contents of the supernatants were determined, and the equivalent to 1.5–2 mg of protein of tissue homogenate was layered onto the gradient. After centrifugation at 237,000 × g in a SW-55 Ti rotor (Beckman) for 4 h at 4 °C, 16 equal-volume fractions were collected, and equal volumes of each fraction were loaded onto 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by immunoblotting. Buoyant density analysis was carried out essentially as described by Vande Velde et al. (38Vande Velde C. Miller T.M. Cashman N.R. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices and spinal cords of late-stage SOD1G93A and SOD1G93A;Dync1h1Loa/+ mice were collected and washed with PBS−Ca/Mg and then placed in an ice-cold HB containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA plus protease, and phosphatase inhibitors. Tissues were homogenized on ice with seven strokes of a glass-pestle homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected, and the pellets were washed with 0.5 volumes HB and centrifuged again. Supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min to yield a crude mitochondrial pellet and post-mitochondrial supernatant. Crude mitochondria were gently resuspended in HB and then adjusted to 1.204 g/ml Optiprep (iodixanol) and loaded in the bottom of Beckman Ultra-Clear centrifuge tubes. Crude mitochondria were overlaid with an equal volume of 1.175 g/ml and 1.078 g/ml Optiprep in HB and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 4 h in a Beckman SW-55 Ti rotor. During centrifugation, mitochondria along with any proteins tightly associated with them float up to their corresponding buoyant density of 1.13–1.15 g/ml, which bands at the interface between the 1.078- and 1.175-g/ml layers of the gradient. Under these conditions, soluble or aggregated proteins (density 1.26 g/ml) would not be able to break through the density barrier and should sediment downward. After centrifugation the mitochondria-enriched bands were collected and washed once with HB to remove the Optiprep. The protein contents of these fractions were then determined. Samples of the SOD1G93A and SOD1G93A;Dync1h1Loa/+ cerebral cortex and spinal cord buoyant density gradient (BDG) fractions containing equal amounts of proteins were subjected to treatments with salt, alkali, and digestion with proteinase K in the presence and absence of detergents and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The post-crude mitochondrial supernatant obtained during sample preparation for the buoyant density analysis was used to obtain the microsomal fraction. The pellet (microsomal fraction) obtained after spinning the post-mitochondrial supernatant at 60,000 × g at 4 °C in the Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge was washed once with the HB, and the protein content was determined. Samples of the SOD1G93A and SOD1G93A;Dync1h1Loa/+ cerebral cortex and spinal cord microsomal fractions containing equal amounts of proteins were subjected to chemical insults with salt and alkali and digestion with proteinase K in the presence and absence of detergents and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Samples from the BDG fractions and the microsomal fraction were incubated with 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5) for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were collected, and pellets were washed once and then resuspended in homogenization buffer. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Samples from the BDG fractions and the microsomal fraction containing equal amounts of proteins were incubated sequentially in 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 m KCl for 20 min on ice then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Pellets were washed once. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Samples from the BDG fractions and the microsomal fraction containing equal amounts of proteins were treated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at room temperature in the absence or presence of differing combinations of 0.5–1% Triton X-100 and 1% SDS. Proteinase K was inactivated by adding 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min on ice. Digestions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Brain cortex and spinal cord tissues were dissected and washed once in ice-cold tissue wash buffer (TWB; 0.3 m mannitol, 20 mm MOPS, 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)) then homogenized with a loose pestle in ∼1 ml of TWB supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 7 mm l-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate. Homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred into new tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were gently resuspended in ∼1 ml of TWB supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin but without l-cysteine and re-centrifuged as above; the pellets (mitochondrial fractions) were then gently resuspended in the minimum amount of TWB supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, and protein concentrations were determined. Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically in a Rank oxygen electrode containing 0.4 ml of 0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Cytochrome c oxidase activity was determined after the addition of 10 mm sodium ascorbate and 1 mm tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. Rates are expressed as nmol of O2·min−1.mg of protein−1. Three freshly isolated mouse cortices of each genotype were homogenized and subjected to buoyant density gradient centrifugation to isolate floated mitochondria that were free from protein aggregates, as described above.

https://openalex.org/W2001271981,"Protein phosphatase (PP) 2A is a heterotrimeric enzyme regulated by specific subunits. The B56 (or B'/PR61/PPP2R5) class of B-subunits direct PP2A or its substrates to different cellular locations, and the B56alpha, -beta, and -epsilon isoforms are known to localize primarily in the cytoplasm. Here we studied the pathways that regulate B56alpha subcellular localization. We detected B56alpha in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and at the nuclear envelope and centrosomes, and show that cytoplasmic localization is dependent on CRM1-mediated nuclear export. The inactivation of CRM1 by leptomycin B or by siRNA knockdown caused nuclear accumulation of ectopic and endogenous B56alpha. Conversely, CRM1 overexpression shifted B56alpha to the cytoplasm. We identified a functional nuclear export signal at the C terminus (NES; amino acids 451-469), and site-directed mutagenesis of the NES (L461A) caused nuclear retention of full-length B56alpha. Active NESs were identified at similar positions in the cytoplasmic B56-beta and epsilon isoforms, but not in the nuclear-localized B56-delta or gamma isoforms. The transient expression of B56alpha induced nuclear export of the PP2A catalytic (C) subunit, and this was blocked by the L461A NES mutation. In addition, B56alpha co-located with the PP2A active (A) subunit at centrosomes, and its centrosome targeting involved sequences that bind to the A-subunit. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) assays revealed dynamic and immobile pools of B56alpha-GFP, which was rapidly exported from the nucleus and subject to retention at centrosomes. We propose that B56alpha can act as a PP2A C-subunit chaperone and regulates PP2A activity at diverse subcellular locations."
https://openalex.org/W2088356228,"TRPML3 is a H+-regulated Ca2+ channel that shuttles between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane. The A419P mutation causes the varitint-waddler phenotype as a result of gain-of-function (GOF). The mechanism by which A419P leads to GOF is not known. Here, we show that the TRPML3 pore is dynamic when conducting Ca2+ to change its conductance and permeability, which appears to be mediated by trapping Ca2+ within the pore. The pore properties can be restored by strong depolarization or by conducting Na+ through the pore. The A419P mutation results in expanded channel pore with altered permeability that limits modulation of the pore by Ca2+. This effect is specific for the A419P mutation and is not reproduced by other GOF mutations, including A419G, H283A, and proline mutations in the fifth transmembrane domain. These findings describe a novel mode of a transient receptor potential channel behavior and suggest that pore expansion by the A419P mutation may contribute to the varitint-waddler phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2018661105,"Despite its central role in the protein folding process, the specific mechanism(s) behind β-sheet formation has yet to be determined. For example, whether the nucleation of β-sheets, often containing strands separated in sequence by many residues, is local or not remains hotly debated. Here, we investigate the initial nucleation step of β-sheet formation by performing an analysis of the smallest β-sheets in a non-redundant dataset on the grounds that the smallest sheets, having undergone little growth after nucleation, will be enriched for nucleating characteristics. We find that the residue propensities are similar for small and large β-sheets as are their interstrand pairing preferences, suggesting that nucleation is not primarily driven by specific residues or interacting pairs. Instead, an examination of the structural environments of the two-stranded sheets shows that virtually all of them are contained in single, compact structural modules, or when multiple modules are present, one or both of the chain termini are involved. We, therefore, find that β-nucleation is a local phenomenon resulting either from sequential or topological proximity. We propose that β-nucleation is a result of two opposite factors; that is, the relative rigidity of an associated folding module that holds two stretches of coil close together in topology coupled with sufficient chain flexibility that enables the stretches of coil to bring their backbones in close proximity. Our findings lend support to the hydrophobic zipper model of protein folding (Dill, K. A., Fiebig, K. M., and Chan, H. S. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 1942–1946). Implications for protein folding are discussed. Despite its central role in the protein folding process, the specific mechanism(s) behind β-sheet formation has yet to be determined. For example, whether the nucleation of β-sheets, often containing strands separated in sequence by many residues, is local or not remains hotly debated. Here, we investigate the initial nucleation step of β-sheet formation by performing an analysis of the smallest β-sheets in a non-redundant dataset on the grounds that the smallest sheets, having undergone little growth after nucleation, will be enriched for nucleating characteristics. We find that the residue propensities are similar for small and large β-sheets as are their interstrand pairing preferences, suggesting that nucleation is not primarily driven by specific residues or interacting pairs. Instead, an examination of the structural environments of the two-stranded sheets shows that virtually all of them are contained in single, compact structural modules, or when multiple modules are present, one or both of the chain termini are involved. We, therefore, find that β-nucleation is a local phenomenon resulting either from sequential or topological proximity.

Implications for protein folding are discussed. β-Sheets, a prominent part of protein architecture first predicted almost 60 years ago (1Pauling L. Corey R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1951; 37: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 2Pauling L. Corey R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1951; 37: 729-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), provide an important avenue for folding proteins to maximize the formation of backbone hydrogen bonds, particularly within their cores, that significantly enhance their structural stability. Unlike other prominent types of protein structure such as helices and turns, β-sheets need not be local in nature, with many involving residues separated in sequence by hundreds of amino acids. This non-local nature dramatically complicates the study and prediction of β-sheet formation, as the search for interacting strands becomes a whole-sequence endeavor. With the formation of non-native β-structures now implicated in such debilitating diseases as Alzheimer and Parkinson (3Irvine G.B. El-Agnaf O.M. Shankar G.M. Walsh D.M. Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), unraveling the mechanisms of sheet formation has become more important than ever. Toward this end, considerable research has been done on β-architecture, particularly in the past two decades. With the explosive growth in determined protein structures, statistical analyses of β-architecture have identified intrinsic β-forming propensities for each amino acid (4Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D.

Biol. 1991; 221: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) where a transition occurs from sheet to non-sheet, and structural studies have investigated such features as β-bulges (10Chan A.W. Hutchinson E.G. Harris D. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1574-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), sheet twisting (11Ho B.K. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol.

Data mining has also revealed interstrand residue pairing preferences that may assist with structure prediction (6Wouters M.A. Curmi P.M.G.

Biol. 2006; 356: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas the importance of hydrophobicity for sheet formation has been noted (19Muñoz V. Thompson P.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1997; 390: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, however, the details of sheet formation remain poorly understood. At an elementary level, sheet formation is thought to involve an initial nucleation step wherein two distinct stretches of a polypeptide chain associate to form a new β-seed and subsequent growth steps either from further associations between the two initial strands or from the association of additional strands from other parts of the polypeptide chain. The hydrophobic zipper model of Dill et al. (20Dill K.A. Fiebig K.M. Chan H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 1942-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), for example, describes sheet growth based on local hydrophobic interactions beginning with an initial hydrophobic interaction that serves to limit subsequent conformational searches. Correct strand-strand registration is undoubtedly critical for avoiding excessive non-native sheet formation. Experimentally, β-sheet formation, like protein folding in general, is a challenging process to study, as the time frames involved are rapid, and few intermediates are isolatable. Initial studies of small peptides and protein fragments rich in residues with high β-sheet propensities were hampered by aggregation (21Ramírez-Alvarado M. Serrano L. Blanco F.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 162-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Viguera A.R. Jiménez M.A. Rico M. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the discovery of small, soluble peptides that are able to form two- and three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets dramatically altered the β-sheet experimental landscape (for reviews, see Refs. 23Blanco F. Ramírez-Alvarado M. Serrano L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Lacroix E. Kortemme T. Lopez de la Paz M. Serrano L. Curr. Opin. Struct.

One widely held view is that early turn formation controls the kinetics of β-hairpin formation, whereas the subsequent creation of a cross-strand hydrophobic core provides the thermodynamic stabilization (27Jäger M. Nguyen H. Crane J.C. Kelly J.W. Gruebele M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 373-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 28Espinosa J.F. Syud F.A. Gellman S.H.

De Mori G.M. Roccatano D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 538-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This view is not, however, universal. Other experimental and computational studies report an opposing β-sheet formation mechanism, one where nonspecific hydrophobic collapse occurs first followed by a rate-limiting search through a series of collapsed states for the correct native alignment (32Petrovich M. Jonsson A.L. Ferguson N. Daggett V. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 865-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36Dinner A.R. Lazaridis T. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9068-9073Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In this work we perform statistical analyses and data mining on a non-redundant set of protein structures to investigate the initial nucleation step in β-sheet formation. To focus our analysis on nucleating features, we have investigated the smallest β-sheets, particularly those with just two strands that have undergone nucleation but little if any subsequent growth. Surprisingly, despite using a large dataset, we find that essentially all two-stranded β-sheets undergo topologically local nucleation; virtually all such sheets are either contained in the same folding module or involve one (or both) termini of a protein chain. Implications for both the folding of larger β-sheets and proteins in general are discussed. A non-redundant dataset of protein structures with 40 or more residues was assembled using the PDB-REPRDB server (39Noguchi T. Matsuda H. Akiyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) consisting of protein chains from the RCSB Protein Data Bank, release #2007_01_21. Only structures solved by x-ray crystallography that have resolutions less than or equal to 2.0 Å and R-factors less than or equal to 0.25 were included. Those with chain breaks or with missing non-hydrogen atoms were excluded as were membrane proteins and polypeptide chains that are part of larger structural complexes. To ensure non-redundancy, only one representative was chosen for the dataset from among those protein chains that had sequence identities greater than 30% or structural alignments less than 10 Å. In addition, several chains were found to have the same fold by visual inspection; in these cases, only one representative was retained in the dataset. In all, the dataset consisted of 1334 protein chains, listed in supplemental Table ST1. The DSSP program (40Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar) was used to identify the secondary structure of each residue in the dataset. Two-stranded sheets with six or more residues and three-or-more-stranded sheets with seven or more residues were analyzed in this study (supplemental Table ST2). A number of two-stranded β-sheets were found to be closely associated with larger β-sheets; to avoid the possibility that the nucleation of these smaller sheets was influenced by these associations, these smaller sheets were also excluded from analysis. In all, 439 2-stranded sheets, and 2114 three-or-more-stranded sheets were included in our analysis. β-Propensity values Pr for each amino acid r were calculated using the Chou-Fasman propensity formula (4Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar), Pr=[Sr/Sall]/[Dr/Dall](Eq. 1) where Sr and Sall are the number of r residues and of all residues in strands in the dataset, and Dr and Dall are the total number of r residues and of all residues in the dataset. Separate propensity values were calculated analogously for two-stranded β-sheets, two-stranded β-sheets with eight or less residues, two-stranded β-sheets with nine or more residues, three-or-more-stranded β-sheets, and for the edge strands in three-or-more-stranded β-sheets. Interstrand pairing preferences between residues a and b in two-stranded β-sheets, Pa,b, were calculated using Pa,b=Ia,b/Ea,b(Eq. 2) where Ia,b and Ea,b are the actual and expected number of times residues a and b are aligned opposite one another on adjacent two-stranded β-strands. Ea,b is given by, Ea,b=[Na*Nb/N2]*Iall(Eq. 3) where Na and Nb are the number of times residues a and b are found in two-stranded β-sheets, N is the total number of residues in two-stranded β-sheets, and Iall is the total number of interstrand pairings between strands in two-stranded sheets. Visual inspection of the sheets in this study was performed using Pymol (DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA). Residue propensities for various β-environments were calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The non-redundant dataset employed (hereafter referred to as “the dataset”) contains 1334 protein chains containing a total of 2553 β-sheets (see the supplemental Tables ST1 and ST2 for lists of protein chains and β-sheets used in this study). Residue β-sheet propensities are highly correlated with those reported in other studies (Tables 1, supplemental ST3), suggesting that our data base is not unduly biased. Edge and interior strand propensity values have also been calculated separately (Table 1).TABLE 1Residue propensities for various β-sheet environmentsResidueAll sheetsTwo-stranded sheetsThree-or-more-stranded sheetsAllSmallestaCalculated for two-stranded sheets with eight or fewer residues.LargestbCalculated for two-stranded sheets with nine or more residues.AllEdge strandsAla0.770.610.620.580.780.68Val1.941.731.661.841.951.75Leu1.180.940.970.901.191.02Ile1.771.471.571.301.791.62Phe1.421.381.371.401.421.37Tyr1.431.441.441.441.431.28Met11.061.051.071.000.79Cys1.241.161.091.271.241.12Trp1.311.441.062.071.311.31His0.910.910.841.020.910.93Glu0.720.870.701.150.710.98Gln0.770.960.931.010.760.91Lys0.791.051.011.120.771Arg0.931.081.131.000.921.04Ser0.820.780.840.670.820.94Thr1.181.491.531.421.171.25Asp0.540.640.650.610.540.58Asn0.60.670.740.560.600.6Gly0.630.490.490.480.630.55Pro0.440.740.860.550.430.62CorrelationscCorrelations are with the residue propensities for all two-stranded β-sheets.0.890.94Propensities values are calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.”a Calculated for two-stranded sheets with eight or fewer residues.b Calculated for two-stranded sheets with nine or more residues.c Correlations are with the residue propensities for all two-stranded β-sheets. Open table in a new tab Propensities values are calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Given a two-step model for β-sheet formation consisting of initial nucleation followed by subsequent growth, we have calculated propensity values for two-stranded and three-or-more-stranded β-sheets separately (Table 1) on the assumption that the former by necessity will contain their nucleation seeds and, hence, be enriched for nucleating residues. In addition, given that two-stranded β-sheets consist solely of edge strands, we have separately calculated edge and interior propensity values for the three-or-more-stranded sheets for comparison. In all, there are 439 2-stranded β-sheets in the dataset. High correlations between residue propensities for 2-stranded and 3-or-more-stranded β-sheets (r = 0.89) and between residues propensities for 2-stranded and edge strands (r = 0.94) are observed. That the residue propensities for two-stranded β-sheets are more closely correlated to those for edge strands in larger sheets is not surprising given that both strands in a two-stranded sheet must not only code for nucleation but, being edge strands, also discourage further strand associations. Nonetheless, several residues have moderately higher propensities for 2-stranded sheets than for edge strands in larger sheets, including (with percent increases shown in parentheses) Met (34%), Thr (19%), Tyr (13%), Asn (12%), and, unexpectedly, Pro (19%) (Table 1). A few have lower preferences, particularly Ser (-17%). Overall, however, no distinguishing trends are evident in the two-stranded residue propensities that might account for β-sheet nucleation. To further focus our search for nucleating elements within β-sheets, we calculated residue propensity values for two-stranded sheets with eight or fewer residues separately from those with more than eight residues, again on the assumption that the smaller ones consist almost exclusively of their nucleation seeds (Table 1). In total there are 328 2-stranded β-sheets with 8 or fewer residues in the dataset and 111 2-stranded sheets with more than 8 residues. Notably, few residues show higher propensity for being in the smaller 2-stranded sheets than in the larger ones; only Ile (1.57 versus 1.30), Ser (0.84 versus 0.67), Asn (0.74 versus 0.56), and surprisingly, Pro (0.86 versus 0.55) have elevated propensities for the smallest sheets. Moreover, the elevated propensities for Ile and Ser are very similar to their propensities for edge strands in larger β-sheets, suggesting that the variations observed may simply be random fluctuations. Again, we do not find any clear trends that might be related to β-sheet nucleation. As β-nucleation involves an interaction between two separate parts of a polypeptide chain, we have also checked for specific cross-strand pairing preferences between spatially neighboring residues in two-stranded β-sheets. Previous studies of pairing preferences have confirmed that cross-strand residue pairings are non-random, and specific pairing preferences for various structural environments have been identified and rationalized (6Wouters M.A. Curmi P.M.G.

Biol. 2006; 356: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study we have restricted our analysis to cross-strand pairing preferences found on two-stranded β-sheets to focus on β-nucleating characteristics. Preferences have been normalized against expected values for the specific residue distributions in two-stranded sheets, as described under “Materials and Methods.” As seen in Table 2, general preferences exist between pairs of hydrophobic residues, and between pairs of hydrophilic residues. Particularly high preferences are seen between pairs of Cys (13.40) and Thr (2.65) residues as well as between Asp-His pairs (2.74), Asp-Lys pairs (2.78), Glu-Lys pairs (2.57), and oppositely charged residues in general, whereas notably low preferences are seen for pairings of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. Cys-Trp pairings also occur more often than expected (3.24), but as there are only 7 instances of this pairing in the dataset, they cannot play a substantial role in β-nucleation. Direct comparison of these pairing preferences with those from larger β-architectures is hampered by the fact that pairings from larger sheets necessarily involve at least one interior strand, and interior strands are known to have different residue propensities in general (6Wouters M.A. Curmi P.M.G. Proteins. 1995; 22: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, all of the favored cross-strand pairings for two-stranded β-sheets have previously been reported to have high occurrence frequencies across β-sheets in general (6Wouters M.A. Curmi P.M.G.

Open table in a new tab Values are the z scores measuring the differences between actual and expected frequency counts as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values larger than 2.5 are shown in bold and double underlined. We also separately calculated the cross-strand pairing preferences for two-stranded β-sheets with eight or less, or more than eight, residues (supplemental Table ST4), again under the assumption that the smallest sheets should be particularly enriched for nucleating characteristics. In this case, however, the small number of larger two-stranded sheets in the dataset leads to a high signal-to-noise ratio in the pairing preferences for these sheets, resulting in considerable variation between these two groups. Nevertheless, we identify those pairings that satisfy the following criteria: Psmall>1.5(Eq. 4) Psmall-Plarge>1.0(Eq. 5) Fsmall>12(Eq. 6) where Psmall and Plarge are the propensities of a pairing to be in the smallest and largest two-stranded β-sheets, and Fsmall is the frequency with which a pairing is found in the smallest two-stranded sheets. This last condition removes rare pairings from consideration, as their scarcity prevents them from playing a significant role in nucleation. Cross-strand pairings satisfying these criteria included (with Psmall and Plarge values in parentheses): Asp-His (3.99/0.86), Asp-Lys (3.62/1.39), Asp-Gly (2.69/1.12), Pro-Arg (2.06/0.60), Leu-Leu (1.91/0.26), Gly-Ala (1.90/0.59), Tyr-Ala (1.80/0.60), Asn-Lys (1.76/0.53), and Phe-Ile (1.72/0.39). We examined both the sequential relationship between the strands in two-stranded β-sheets and the structural environment in which these sheets are found for distinguishing features that might elucidate β-nucleation. The majority of sheets in the dataset (273 of439) have strands that are separated by 10 residues or less, including 207, which is separated by at most 5 residues (see supplemental Table ST5 for a complete characterization of all two-stranded β-sheets in the dataset). All but two of the 2-stranded β-sheets with 10 or fewer intervening residues are part of β-hairpins, with either tight turns or somewhat more extended turns between the two strands, as expected given the short length of intervening coil. Nucleation in all of these cases is almost certainly a result of turn formation coupled with chain diffusion that produces favorable interstrand interactions akin to what is proposed in models such as the hydrophobic zipper model of Dill et al. (20Dill K.A. Fiebig K.M. Chan H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 1942-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The two exceptions are both parallel 2-stranded β-sheets with very short intervening stretches of random coil (PDB code 2CAP, chain A, residues 276–287; PDB code 1QBA, residues 523–536); nucleation is undoubtedly a local phenomenon for these sheets also, perhaps involving the formation of an extra turn that aligns the strands in a parallel rather than antiparallel orientation. A further 73 2-stranded β-sheets in the dataset have between 11 and 30 residues separating their stands, and although it would be tenuous at best to describe such strand separations as local, the vast majority of these sheets (69 of 73), including the residues located between their strands, are contained in single, generally compact structural units, or modules following Ref. 41Pickford A.R.

For example, although individual protein molecules in solution are likely to differ at any given time in their conformation and the ions and molecules with which they are interacting, most experimental approaches monitor only their average conformation and average binding properties. Defining the individual states accessible to a molecule is central to defining the mechanisms of the biological processes in which it participates.Within the past couple of decades, a suite of extraordinarily sensitive methods has been developed that allows the dimensions and motions of individual biological molecules to be monitored and manipulated both in solution and in cells. Molecules can be visualized by attaching either fluorescent labels or microscopic beads that can be visualized with spectrophotometers or microscopes while mechanical, optical, and magnetic forces, generally applied in vitro to a molecule tethered to a surface, allow them to be manipulated. Although new methodologies are constantly being developed, the approaches most widely used at this time are optical monitoring of fluorescent labels or reporter microbeads, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, atomic force microscopy, magnetic tweezers, and optical tweezers (or traps).These approaches differ in the molecular properties that they monitor and their temporal and spatial resolution, and, thus, different approaches are often optimal for different systems. At the same time, applying several approaches to the same problem can increase the depth of understanding that can be achieved. Observations made with single fluorescent labels or reporter microbeads typically provide insights into the movement of entire molecules, for example, the movement of myosin heads along an actin filament. Fluorescence energy resonance transfer between two fluorophores assesses the distance between them and changes in that distance over time as a result of intramolecular motion or changes in the interactions between molecules. The remaining three methods, atomic force microscopy, magnetic tweezers, and optical tweezers, all apply force to a molecule that is tethered at both ends and measure the effect of the force on the molecule. Typically, one end of the molecule is tethered to a surface, whereas the second is attached to a cantilever, in atomic force microscopy, or a microbead, with magnetic and optical tweezers. These methods are widely used to study the unfolding of RNA or proteins or changes in DNA topology. In atomic force microscopy, the cantilever to which the molecule is attached applies a mechanical force to the molecule, and the effect of the force on the molecule is evaluated by monitoring the reflection of a laser beam from the cantilever. In magnetic tweezers experiments, the microbead to which the molecule is attached is superparamagnetic and positioned below the poles of a pair of magnets so that decreasing the distance between the magnets and the surface to which the molecule is tethered will stretch the molecule, whereas rotating the magnet will exert torque on the molecule. In contrast, in an optical tweezers experiment, the bead is made of a dielectric material, and the force is generated by the electromagnetic field produced by a laser beam.Single-molecule methods can provide novel new insights into an extraordinarily broad range of questions, including enzyme mechanisms; folding of DNA, RNA, proteins, and polysaccharides; membrane protein structure and function; motor proteins and cytoskeletal dynamics; rotary motors; processive nucleic acid enzymes; protein-nucleic acid interactions; single-molecule sequencing; vesicle trafficking; membrane fusion; and even brain imaging. The four minireviews in this series illustrate a few of the ways in which these approaches can be used.The first minireview, by Alegre-Cebollada et al., describes how they used atomic force microscopy to compare and demonstrate differences at subatomic resolution in the transition states of disulfide bond oxidation catalyzed by various members of the thioredoxin family. By determining the relationship between the force applied to the disulfide bond and the rate of oxidation, Alegre-Cebollada et al. were able to evaluate the difference in the length of the disulfide bond in the ground and transition states for a simple Sn2 reaction. They found that, whereas the force dependence of the reaction is always positive for small reducing agents, the effect of the applied force on the rates of reactions catalyzed by thioredoxins varies with the structure and dynamics of the enzyme. This approach should be useful in studying and comparing other enzymes that cleave covalent bonds, and the minireview defines the criteria that must be met in applying this approach to other enzymes.In the second minireview, Neuman focuses on how torque produced by magnetic and optical tweezers can be used to control and measure the supercoiling of DNA molecules and the relationship between supercoiling and the mechanical properties of DNA. Neuman reviews how these approaches have been employed to monitor supercoil relaxation by two topoisomerases, negative supercoiling by DNA gyrase, and promoter opening and transcriptional initiation by bacterial RNA polymerase. The minireview looks to future work on the topology of chromatin fibers and rotary motors such as RNA polymerase.The third minireview, by Finzi and Dunlap, emphasizes the structures, kinetics, and thermodynamics of the DNA loops that form in transcriptional regulatory nucleoprotein complexes as a result of protein-protein interactions. The studies of the lac, gal, and λ repressors presented in this minireview utilize atomic force microscopy, magnetic tweezers, and the tethered-particle method, in which movement of a reporter bead attached to tethered DNA enables the changes in length of the DNA resulting from loop formation or release to be detected. This minireview also discusses the role of DNA-coiling and DNA-bending cofactors in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, particularly Snf2 chromatin-remodeling factors.The last minireview in this series, by Hamdan and van Oijen, describes how single-molecule flow-stretching experiments have led to new insights into how the molecular events in DNA replication in T7 phage are coordinated. In the experiments described, DNA molecules tagged at each end with microbeads were oriented by laminar flow so that their lengths could be determined. Because transitions between double- and single-stranded DNAs alter the length of the DNA, the steps in replication in which these transitions occur can be identified. Like Finzi and Dunlap, Hamdan and van Oijen were particularly interested in DNA loops created by protein-protein interactions, in this case, the loops that form in the lagging DNA strand to keep replication of the leading and lagging strands in phase. They set out to determine what triggers release of the loops. Is it the synthesis of a new primer molecule or the collision of the polymerase with the Okazaki fragment previously synthesized? In fact, they found that both mechanisms operate to ensure that Okazaki fragments of the correct length are synthesized.This series covers only a small fraction of the topics that can be investigated with single-molecule methods. The Journal of Biological Chemistry is expanding its coverage of this important area and encourages submission of manuscripts that use single-molecule methods to provide novel and important insights into molecular and cellular processes.
