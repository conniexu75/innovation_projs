https://openalex.org/W1635474458,"Sphingolipid metabolism was examined in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Differentiation of HL-60 cells with 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D3; 100 nM) was accompanied by turnover. Maximum turnover of [3H]choline-labeled occurred 2 h following vitamin D3 treatment, with levels decreasing to 77 +/- 6% of control and returning to base-line levels by 4 h. Ceramide and phosphorylcholine were concomitantly generated. Ceramide mass levels increased by 55% at 2 h following vitamin D3 treatment and returned to base-line levels by 4 h. The amount of phosphorylcholine produced equaled the amount of hydrolyzed, suggesting the involvement of a sphingomyelinase. Vitamin D3 treatment resulted in a 90% increase in the activity of a neutral sphingomyelinase from HL-60 cells. The inferred role of hydrolysis in the induction of cell differentiation was investigated using an exogenous sphingomyelinase. When a bacterial sphingomyelinase was added at concentrations that caused a similar degree of hydrolysis as 100 nM vitamin D3, it enhanced the ability of subthreshold levels of vitamin D3 to induce HL-60 cell differentiation. This study demonstrates the existence of a sphingomyelin cycle in human cells. Such sphingolipid cycles (Hannun, Y., and Bell, R. (1989) Science 243, 500-507) may function in a signal transduction pathway and in cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1570035884,"Two distinct regions of the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) promoter are responsive to autoregulation and activation by phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate): sequences located between nucleotides -454 to -323 (first promoter) and between the two transcriptional start sites. We have now characterized in detail the induction of the second promoter (sequences between nucleotides + 1 to +271) of the TGF-beta 1 gene by both TGF-beta 1 and phorbol ester. By assaying progressively deleted mutations in the second promoter, we have found two regions responsible for the induction; each contains a phorbol ester-responsive element. In vitro transcription of the second promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase chimeric genes using nuclear extracts of A-549 cells showed that deletion of the putative phorbol ester-responsive elements results in a 70-80% decrease in activity. DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift assays showed that binding to an Sp1 site and the putative TRE elements are required for maximal expression of the second promoter region of the TGF-beta 1 gene. These results suggest that AP-1, which is capable of conferring phorbol ester or TGF-beta 1 responsiveness, is the major transcription factor involved in the second promoter-derived transcription of the TGF-beta 1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1488492700,"A laminin receptor was isolated from human MG-63 osteosarcoma cells by affinity chromatography on human laminin. The isolated receptor was defined as the α3β1 integrin by immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific antibodies. A previously unclassified laminin-binding integrin from rat cells was shown also to contain the α3 subunit. Both receptors bound to human and mouse laminin in a radioreceptor assay. They also both bound to some extent to fibronectin in this assay, but only the MG-63 cell receptor showed binding to type IV collagen. The binding of the radiolabeled receptor to insoluble laminin was inhibited by unlabeled receptor, by soluble laminin, and by chymotryptic fragments of laminin that have previously been shown to contain neurite-promoting and cell attachment-promoting activities. Moreover, the receptor binding was also inhibited by monoclonal antibodies capable of inhibiting the neurite-promoting activity of laminin and known to bind to laminin near the junction of the long arm and its terminal globule. One of these antibodies was reactive with fusion proteins expressed from laminin cDNA clones. The immunoreactive clones corresponded to the COOH-terminal end of the B1 subunit. These results identify the integrin-type laminin receptor isolated from the osteosarcoma cells as the α3β1 integrin and localize its binding site in close proximity of the B1 subunit COOH terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1513464976,"The alpha-amylase of Bacillus licheniformis (BLA) is stable and active at high temperature. More than 80% of its activity is retained after heat treatment at 90 degrees C for 30 min, and the optimum temperature for its activity is 80-85 degrees C. In contrast, the alpha-amylase of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BAA), the amino acid sequence of which shows 80% homology with that of BLA, is rapidly inactivated at 90 degrees C. Various chimeric genes were constructed from the structural genes for the two enzymes, and their products were analyzed for stability as to irreversible thermoinactivation. Two regions in the amino acid sequence of BLA comprising Gln178 (region I) and the 255th-270th residues (region II), respectively, were shown to determine the thermostability of BLA. Region I plays a major role in determining the thermostability. By means of site-directed mutagenesis of the BAA gene, deletion of Arg176 and Gly177 in region I and substitutions of alanine for Lys269 and aspartic acid for Asn266 in region II were shown to be responsible for the enhancement of the thermostability. Mutant BAAs containing the above deletion and substitutions showed almost the same thermostability as BLA as to irreversible thermoinactivation. Nevertheless, the mutant BAAs showed a temperature optimum as low as that of BAA (65 degrees C), indicating that they are still susceptible to reversible inactivation at temperatures higher than 65 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1547422828,"From a cDNA library made from telsons of scorpions of the species Androctonus australis, full-length cDNAs of about 370 nucleotides encoding precursors of toxins active on mammals or on insects have been isolated using oligonucleotide probes. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs revealed that the precursors contain signal peptides of about 20 amino acid residues. In addition, precursors of toxins active on mammals have extensions at their COOH-terminal ends: Arg or Gly-Arg. The processing steps required to generate toxins from their respective precursors are thus not identical for all of them. Southern blot analysis performed at the genomic level with a cDNA encoding toxin II suggested a single copy gene having a minimum size of 2800 base pairs. Finally, in an attempt to successfully express an animal toxin, monkey kidney COS-7 cells transfected with a plasmid harboring a cDNA encoding toxin II transiently expressed a recombinant toxin having the immunological and biological properties of toxin II."
https://openalex.org/W1548745574,"Microscopic disulfide-exchange rate constants have been measured for the formation and opening of small disulfide loops in reactions between glutathione and peptides containing 2 cysteines. Twelve cysteine-Xm-cysteine peptides have been studied, where X is an amino acid and m is the number of amino acids between the cysteines. Homopolymers of alanine for m equaling 0-5 are evaluated, as well as X1 and X2 series employing glycine, valine, or proline. Equilibrium constants Kc for loop closing are only slightly dependent on the nature of X. Loops with even values of m generally are favored relative to loops with odd values. Kc increases in the rank order X1, X3, X0, X5, X4, and X2. Formation of a disulfide between sequentially adjacent cysteines therefore is not especially difficult. The dependence of Kc on the odd-even nature of m is compared with similar patterns observed both in statistics of disulfide formation in naturally occurring proteins and in theoretical studies of peptide cyclization. The relative equilibrium populations of intramolecular disulfides in peptides containing cysteine-cysteine-cysteine and cysteine-serine-cysteine-serine-cysteine clusters are consistent with predictions based on the values of Kc in the two-cysteine peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1686360944,"Abstract The transport activity for cystine in cultured human fibroblasts decreased after incubation of the cells under a low oxygen concentration. After the incubation for 48 h under 3% oxygen, the Vmax of the transport was decreased to less than one-third of that of the control cells, with little change in Km. The similar transport activity was observed in the cells cultured under 3% oxygen for 10-40 days with several times of passages. When these low oxygen-cultured cells were incubated under room air, the activity was enhanced with a lag of about 4 h and was almost completely restored within 24 h. This restoration required protein synthesis. The cystine transport activity increased by 50% after exposure of the cells to hyperoxia (40% oxygen). From these results it is concluded that the transport activity for cystine is induced by oxygen. In contrast, little change in the transport activities for alanine and leucine occurred in the cells exposed to the corresponding hypoxia or hyperoxia. Since the cystine transported into the cells is reduced to cysteine and the cysteine readily exits to the culture medium where it autoxidizes to cystine, a cystine-cysteine cycle across the plasma membrane has been postulated. Since the autoxidation of cysteine in the culture medium was markedly slowed down under the low oxygen concentration, the change in the cystine transport activity in response to the oxygen concentration was regarded as pertinent. Induction of the cystine transport activity may constitute a protective mechanism against the oxidative stress, to which the culture cells are exposed, by providing the cells with cysteine which is mainly incorporated into glutathione."
https://openalex.org/W1588199014,"We have reported previously that the 69-kDa major phosphoprotein, secreted by normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, is osteopontin, a glycosylated bone matrix protein. Here we show that this 69-kDa osteopontin is secreted by NRK cells in both phosphorylated (pp69) and nonphosphorylated (np69) forms, with estimated isoelectric points of 3.8 and 4.5, respectively. Electrophoretic analysis of radioiodinated cell surface proteins immunoprecipitated with an anti-69-kDa osteopontin serum, demonstrates that the 69-kDa osteopontin is also present on the cell surface, but only its phosphorylated form (pp69) shows such cell surface association. Because osteopontin mediates cell adhesion and spreading, and contains an Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser cell-binding sequence, our observations strongly suggest that the cell surface localization of pp69 osteopontin is receptor-mediated, and the modification by phosphorylation may be crucial for its receptor binding activity. We also report that antisera directed against either fibronectin or 69-kDa osteopontin co-immunoprecipitate both np69 osteopontin and fibronectin as a heat-dissociable complex. In contrast, pp69 osteopontin does not co-precipitate with fibronectin. These observations demonstrate an interactive relationship between np69 and soluble fibronectin. Furthermore, compared to NRK cells, vanadyl sulfate-treated NRK cells which acquire a reversible transformed phenotype, including anchorage-independent growth, show increased levels of pp69 on the cell surface, concomitant with significantly decreased levels of pp69 and elevated levels of np69 in the conditioned media. The data presented here establish transformation sensitivity of NRK cell-secreted osteopontin with respect to its secretion and cell surface localization, and demonstrate that phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of osteopontin have different physiological properties, which may regulate the functional roles of this extracellular matrix protein."
https://openalex.org/W1520497557,"Abstract The cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor (residues 959-1355) has been expressed as a soluble protein in Sf9 insect cells via a Baculovirus expression vector (Ellis, L., Levitan, A., Cobb, M.H., and Ramos, P. (1988) J. Virol. 62, 1634-1639). The purified protein is a monomer as judged by its behavior in sucrose gradients and on gel filtration in the presence or absence of protamine. The initial rate of autophosphorylation using 3 mM MgCl2 is increased 20-30-fold by protamine. A maximum of 4-5 mol of phosphate are incorporated per mol of enzyme. The activity of the enzyme as a function of phosphorylation state was studied for three substrates: a synthetic dodecapeptide derived from the sequence of the major autophosphorylation site in the insulin receptor, poly(Glu, Tyr), 4:1, and histone 2B. Autophosphorylation of the protein to a stoichiometry of 4-5 mol of phosphate/mol increases its enzymatic activity as much as 200-fold; a 30-fold increase in activity occurs upon addition of 1 mol of phosphate/mol. The activities of unphosphorylated enzyme with the three substrates are 3.4, 2.3, and 0.44 nmol/min/mg, respectively. The activities of the autophosphorylated enzyme with the three substrates are 175, 274, and 45 nmol/min/mg, respectively. Exposure of the autophosphorylated enzyme to ADP results in a loss of phosphate from the enzyme which is associated with a decrease in enzymatic activity. Autophosphorylation of the kinase in the presence or absence of protamine displays a marked dependence on enzyme concentration. Furthermore, the rate of autophosphorylation decreases as the viscosity of the solution increases. Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylation occurs via an intermolecular reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1619104716,"The extracellular reaction sequence ATP----ADP----AMP----adenosine participates in regulating the time course of cellular response during crisis or signaling events, such as thrombus formation or neurotransmission. We have investigated the whole time course of hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine by recirculating adenine nucleotide substrates over smooth muscle cells attached to polystyrene beads. Kinetic parameters were estimated for each reaction by fitting observed time courses to models of the pathway. In spite of the inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase by ADP, adenosine was produced very rapidly by smooth muscle cells. Comparisons of the apparent Km values of ADPase and 5'-nucleotidase (determined from experiments in which each substrate was used as the initial substrate with Km values observed when each substrate was supplied from the upstream reaction) suggest that the local concentrations of substrate supplied from the preceding reactions are very much higher than those in the bulk phase. This enhancement of efficiency overcomes the effect of the feed-forward inhibition to give rise to very rapid adenosine production from ADP or ATP. These observations are in marked contrast to our previous findings with endothelial cells (Gordon, E. L., Pearson, J. D., and Slakey, L. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15496-15504), on which feed-forward inhibition causes a profound lag in adenosine production from adenine nucleotides and on which there are no apparent surface effects on substrate delivery."
https://openalex.org/W1607075608,"Antibody against a membrane inhibitor of the C5b-9 complex has been used to investigate regulatory control of the terminal complement proteins on blood platelets. Monospecific rabbit antibody (alpha-P18) was raised against the purified 18-kDa erythrocyte membrane inhibitor of C5b-9 (Sugita, Y., Nakano, Y., and Tomita, M. (1988) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 104, 633-637). In addition to its interaction with erythrocytes, this antibody (and its Fab) bound specifically to platelet membranes. In immunoblots of cell membrane proteins prepared under non-reducing conditions, alpha-P18 bound specifically to an 18-kDa erythrocyte membrane protein and to a 37-kDa platelet membrane protein. Absorption of this antibody by platelet membranes competed its binding to the purified 18-kDa erythrocyte protein, suggesting that epitopes expressed by the erythrocyte 18-kDa C5b-9 inhibitor are common to the platelet. When bound to the platelet surface, the Fab of alpha-P18 increased C9 activation by membrane C5b-8, monitored by exposure of a complex-dependent C9 neo-epitope. Although alpha-P18 caused little increase in the cytolysis of platelets treated with C5b-9 (total release of lactate dehydrogenase less than 5%), it markedly increased the cell stimulatory responses induced by these complement proteins, including, secretion from platelet alpha- and dense granules, conformational activation of cell surface GP IIb-IIIa, release of membrane microparticles from the platelet surface, and exposure of new membrane binding sites for components of the prothrombinase enzyme complex. Prior incubation of C5b67 platelets with 100 micrograms/ml alpha-P18 (Fab) lowered by approximately 10-fold the half-maximal concentration of C8 required to elicit each of these responses (in the presence of excess C9). Incubation with alpha-P18 (Fab) alone did not activate platelets, nor did incubation with this antibody potentiate the stimulatory responses of platelets exposed to other agonists. These data indicate that a membrane inhibitor of the C5b-9 complex normally serves to attenuate the procoagulant responses of blood platelets exposed to activated complement proteins, and suggest the mechanism by which a deletion or inactivation of this cell surface component would increase the risk of vascular thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W1579979890,"We have purified transferase from latex of the commercial rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis and find that it is a dimer with a monomeric molecular mass of 38,000 Da, requires Mg2+, and is stabilized by thiols in agreement with studies of a partially purified preparation previously described (Archer, B. L., and Cockbain, E. G. (1969) Methods Enzymol. 15, 476-480). Greater than 90% of the [1-14C]isopentenyl pyrophosphate which is incorporated into deproteinated rubber particles by the purified prenyltransferase is added to high molecular mass polyisoprene (greater than 20,000 Da). Purified prenyltransferase and deproteinated rubber particles reconstitute 40-60% of the biosynthetic activity of whole latex in samples matched for rubber content. Incorporation is linear with added rubber particles up to at least 10 mg/ml rubber or 20 microM rubber molecules (based on a number average molecular mass of 500,000 Da). Prenyltransferase concentrations estimated in whole latex (0.37% or 160 nM) are sufficient to saturate all elongation sites in whole latex, and addition of purified prenyltransferase does not increase [1-14C]isopentenyl pyrophosphate incorporation. Deproteinated rubber particles can be titrated with the pure enzyme (Kd = 9 nM) demonstrating that the fraction of rubber molecules available for addition is low (approximately 0.01%). An estimated 7,000 isoprene units are added per complex at a rate of 1/s in a typical assay. Hevea prenyltransferase catalyzes the formation of cis-isoprene in the presence of rubber particles. However, in the absence of rubber particles and in the presence of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, the purified prenyltransferase catalyzes the formation of geranyl pyrophosphate and all trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate as demonstrated by thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography, and molecular exclusion chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1578285665,"The ability of cDNAs encoding the human platelet glycoprotein IIbIIIa to be expressed and assembled into a functional integrin receptor was assessed by transient transfection into a human cell line. Transfection of full length cDNAs resulted in synthesis of high levels of integrin subunits which appear to be stable within the cell for several days. Coexpression of both subunits resulted in a proteolytically processed form of GPIIb that associated with GPIIIa as a heterodimeric complex as the cell surface. Transport to the cell surface required association of these subunits with each other or with endogenous integrin subunits. When expressed alone, the GPIIb subunit remained intracellular, while the GPIIIa subunit was found to complex with endogenous proteins and was mobilized to the cell surface. The GPIIbIIIa receptor complex facilitated attachment of cells to known ligands for GPIIbIIIa: fibrinogen, vitronectin, and von Willebrand factor. This adhesion was sensitive to inhibition by the peptide GRGDV and the monoclonal antibody AP2, known inhibitors of platelet aggregation"
https://openalex.org/W1627311194,"The amino acid sequence of rubber elongation factor, a recently discovered protein tightly bound to rubber particles isolated from the commercial rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis, is presented. The role of this protein in rubber elongation and its interaction with prenyltransferase and rubber particles have been discussed in the preceding paper in this series (Dennis, M. S., and Light, D. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18608-18617). Trypsin, Staphylococcus protease, chymotrypsin, acetic acid, and hydroxylamine cleavage were used to generate peptide fragments that were isolated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by amino acid composition and automated Edman degradation. Each digest contained one blocked peptide identified as the amino terminus. The blocked amino-terminal peptide from the tryptic digest was analyzed by amino acid composition, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (molecular ion 1659.9), subdigested with Staphylococcus protease for partial sequence analysis, and finally deblocked with bovine liver acyl-peptide hydrolase removing an acetylalanine to allow analysis by Edman degradation. Rubber elongation factor is 137 amino acids long, has a molecular mass of 14,600 daltons, and lacks four amino acids: cysteine, methionine, histidine, and tryptophan. The NH2 terminus is highly charged and contains only acidic residues (5 of the first 12 amino acids). The first four amino acids are highly represented in other known NH2-terminally acetylated proteins. Comparison of the sequence of rubber elongation factor with other known sequences does not reveal significant sequence similarities that would suggest an evolutionary relationship."
https://openalex.org/W1554617000,"Animal mitochondrial protein synthesis factors elongation factor (EF) Tu and EF-Ts have been purified as an EF-Tu. Ts complex from crude extracts of bovine liver mitochondria. The mitochondrial complex has been purified 10,000-fold to near homogeneity by a combination of chromatographic procedures including high performance liquid chromatography. The mitochondrial EF-Tu.Ts complex is very stable and cannot be dissociated even in the presence of high concentrations of guanine nucleotides. No guanine nucleotide binding to this complex can be observed in the standard nitrocellulose filter binding assay. Mitochondrial EF-Ts activity can be detected by its ability to facilitate guanine nucleotide exchange with Escherichia coli EF-Tu. The EF-Tumt exhibits similar levels of activity on isolated mammalian mitochondrial and E. coli ribosomes, but displays minimal activity on Euglena gracilis chloroplast 70 S ribosomes and has no detectable activity on wheat germ cytoplasmic ribosomes. In contrast to the bacterial EF-Tu and the EF-Tu from the chloroplast of E. gracilis, the ability of the mitochondrial factor to catalyze polymerization is not inhibited by the antibiotic kirromycin."
https://openalex.org/W1499068061,"Abstract Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) and other polar/apolar chemical agents are potent inducers of erythroid differentiation in murine erythroleukemia cells (MELC), as well as other transformed cell lines. Although the mechanism of action of HMBA is not yet known, evidence has been obtained that protein kinase C (PKC) plays a role in this process. In this study we provide further evidence that establishes this relationship. MELC contain two principal PKC activities, PKC beta and PKC alpha. MELC variants, selected for resistance to vincristine (VC), which display acceleration of their rates of induced differentiation, are enriched in PKC beta activity. When MELC are exposed to HMBA there is a fall in PKC activity, largely accounted for by a decline in PKC beta. This decline in PKC activity is faster in the VC-resistant, rapidly differentiating MELC. We previously demonstrated that VC-resistant MELC are resistant to the inhibition of differentiation by the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In both VC-sensitive and -resistant MELC, PMA causes rapid membrane translocation and then a decline in PKC activity, accompanied by a generation of a Ca2+- and phospholipid-independent protein kinase activity. In VC/PMA-resistant variants, this Ca2+/phospholipid-independent protein kinase activity persists considerably longer than in the VC-sensitive variants. This correlates with the resistance to PMA and provides additional evidence for a role for the Ca2+/phospholipid-independent protein kinase activity during induced differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1525912555,"Abstract Contractile activity of neonatal cardiac myocytes stimulated hypertrophic growth as compared with nonbeating cells that were depolarized with 50 mM KCl. Growth of contracting myocytes was associated with an increased rRNA content as measured by the total RNA/DNA ratio. The fractional rates of rRNA synthesis (K8) and rRNA degradation were determined in contracting and nonbeating myocytes to assess their relative contributions in increasing rRNA content during growth. The values for K8 were calculated from the specific radioactivity of 3'-[3H]UMP in 18 and 28 S rRNA after purification by hybridization to cloned rDNA. The cellular [3H]UTP pool served as the precursor for rRNA synthesis in myocytes that were labeled with 50 microM [3H]uridine. K8 values for 18 and 28 S rRNA in contracting myocytes were accelerated by 59 and 53%, respectively, after 3 days as compared with nonbeating myocytes. Calculations of the rate of cellular rRNA synthesis, which took into account the increased content of myocyte rRNA, revealed that synthesis of both 18 and 28 S rRNA was accelerated 2-fold after 2 days of contraction. The derived values for degradation of 18 and 28 S rRNA were increased marginally in contracting myocytes, but cellular rRNA degradation rates averaged 57% higher. The difference between cellular rates of rRNA synthesis and degradation in contracting myocytes accounted for the 30% increase in rRNA content. These data demonstrated that increased rRNA content in contracting myocytes resulted from acceleration of the fractional rate of rRNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1561431337,"Phosphotransacetylase (EC 2.3.1.8) was purified 83-fold to a specific activity of 2.5 mmol of acetyl-CoA synthesized per min/mg of protein from Methanosarcina thermophila cultivated on acetate. This rate was 10-fold greater than the rate of acetyl phosphate synthesis. The native enzyme (Mr 42,000-52,000) was a monomer and was not integral to the membrane. Activity was optimum at pH 7.0, and 35-45 degrees C. The enzyme was stable to air and to temperatures up to 70 degrees C, but was inactivated at higher temperatures. Phosphate and sulfate partially protected against heat inactivation. Potassium or ammonium ion concentrations above 10 mM were required for maximum activity of the purified enzyme; the intracellular potassium concentration of M. thermophila approximated 175 mM. Sodium, phosphate, sulfate, and arsenate ions were inhibitory to enzyme activity. Western blots of cell extracts showed that phosphotransacetylase was synthesized in higher quantity in acetate-grown cells than in methanol-grown cells."
https://openalex.org/W1487303560,"Abstract Temporal changes in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cultured human foreskin fibroblasts were investigated using image analysis techniques to simultaneously monitor Lys-bradykinin (BK)- or thrombin-induced elevations of [Ca2+]i in each individual cell within a microscopic field. Responses to BK are heterogeneous with respect to the shapes of the [Ca2+]i time courses. Furthermore, the onsets of these responses follow a variable lag period such that the individual cell responses occur asynchronously. The asynchrony and heterogeneity of individual cell responses are not related to cell cycle differences since noncycling cells respond in a similar manner. When cells are ranked according to order of an initial response to BK (the first cell to respond is ranked 1, the second to respond is 2, etc.), restimulation of the same cells with BK elicits a similar order of cell responses, and the shape of the [Ca2+]i time course of an individual cell is similar for both responses to BK. If cells that were stimulated with BK are washed and restimulated with thrombin (which produces [Ca2+]i changes similar to those induced by BK), the response order to thrombin does not correspond to the response order following BK stimulation. These data suggest that the asynchrony of [Ca2+]i changes induced by BK or thrombin is characteristic for each mitogen and may be determined by cell-to-cell variation in receptor number."
https://openalex.org/W2118998472,"We have previously shown that radioactivity from [acetyl-3H]AcCoA is concentrated into isolated intact rat liver Golgi vesicles. The incorporated radioactivity occurred in acid-soluble and acid-insoluble components, and the acid-insoluble fraction included O-acetylated sialic acids (Varki, A., and Diaz, S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6600-6608). Nearly all of the protein-associated radioactivity was found to be in sialic acids alpha 2-6-linked to N-linked oligosaccharides on endogenous glycoproteins. Incubation of the vesicles with CMP-[3H]sialic acid resulted in labeling of a very similar group of glycoproteins. The 3H-O-acetyl groups were found at both the 7- and the 9-positions of N-acetylneuraminic acid residues at the end of the labeling reaction. Although 7-O-acetyl groups can undergo migration to the 9-position under physiological conditions, kinetic studies using O-acetyl-14C-labeled internal and O-acetyl-3H-labeled external standards indicate that during the labeling, release, and purification, negligible migration occurred. Studies with mild periodate oxidation provided further confirmation that O-acetyl esters are added directly to both the 7- and the 9-positions of the sialic acids in this system. The acid-soluble, low molecular weight component is released from the vesicles by increasing concentrations of saponin, and its exit parallels that of CMP-[14C]sialic acid taken up during the incubation. The vesicles themselves are impermeant to free acetate. However, even after short incubations, this saponin-releasable radioactivity was almost exclusively in [3H] acetate and not in [3H]acetyl-CoA. The apparent Km for accumulation of the [3H]acetate is almost identical with that for the generation of the acid-insoluble O-acetylated sialic acids. Most of this accumulation of free acetate is also blocked by coenzyme A-SH. Only a small portion arises from the action of an endogenous esterase on the 3H-O-acetylated sialic acids. Taken together, the results indicate that accumulation of free [3H]acetate occurs within the lumen of the vesicles in parallel with O-acetylation of sialic acids and is probably a product of abortive acetylation. It is not known if this reaction occurs in vivo. Permeabilization of Golgi vesicles to low molecular weight molecules with saponin does not alter the rate of acetylation substantially. Furthermore, double label studies suggest that the intact acetyl-CoA molecule does not gain access to the lumen of the vesicles. These results indicate that the acetylation reaction may have a different mechanism from previously described Golgi glycosylation reactions, wherein specific transporters concentrate sugar nucleotides for use by luminally oriented transferases."
https://openalex.org/W1509318454,"Mammalian cell proteins, modified post-translationally by derivatives of [3H]mevalonic acid, were subjected to methylation and sulfonium salt cleavage reactions previously used to release isoprenoids from cysteine residues in yeast peptides. The labeled isoprenoid extracted into chloroform comigrated with farnesol through a series of chromatography steps including Sep-Pak C-18 fractionation, size exclusion on Bio-Beads, and reverse-phase chromatography. Further resolution of the material by normal phase liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography demonstrated the presence of farnesol, nerolidol, and other unidentified hydrophobic derivatives. Similar products were generated when S-farnesyl cysteine was subjected to the methylation and cleavage procedures. These preliminary findings suggest that farnesylation of cysteine residues accounts for the well documented incorporation of mevalonic acid into mammalian cell proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1559427790,"Aluminum fluoride and beryllium fluoride complexes have previously been shown to bind tightly to F-ADP-actin and GDP-microtubules in competition with Pi and to mimic the XDP-Pi transient state of the polymerization. The structure of the bound complexes is investigated here in further detail. Using a fluoride ionspecific electrode, the number of fluoride atoms per aluminum or beryllium atom in the bound complex could be determined. The results indicate that AlF−4 and either BeF2(OH)−•H2O or BeF‒3•H2O are the tightly bound species in both F-actin and microtubules. The dependences of the binding on pF and pH are consistent with this conclusion. The possible geometries of aluminum and beryllium fluorides in the γ-phosphate subsite of the nucleotide are discussed in correlation with the catalytic mechanism of nucleotide hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1594292710,"Abstract Tissue factor is a lipoprotein, expressed on the surface of cells, which binds coagulation Factor VII or VIIa, leading to activation of Factors X and IX with subsequent fibrin generation. Cellular tissue factor activity is important in pathophysiologic processes such as inflammation and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In this study, the long-chain base sphingosine inhibited coagulation initiated by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated intact human monocytes. Sphingosine (5-100 microM) also profoundly inhibited thromboplastin-initiated coagulation (greater than 90% decrease in thromboplastin activity). This inhibition was dose- and time-dependent. Sphingosine inhibited neither the intrinsic pathway of coagulation nor thrombin generation of fibrin. The sphingosine analogues sphingomyelin, ceramide, or N-acetylsphingosine did not affect thromboplastin activity, suggesting that the polar head of sphingosine was necessary for interaction of the molecule with the coagulation system. Investigation of the biochemical mechanism revealed that sphingosine (5-50 microM), but neither sphingomyelin nor ceramide, inhibited specific binding of radiolabeled Factor VII to lipopolysaccharide-stimulated intact monocytes. The results suggest that sphingosine may regulate monocyte tissue factor-initiated coagulation by modulating Factor VII binding to tissue factor. Sphingosine may represent a new class of inhibitors of hemostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1527570984,"Abstract Using nuclear extracts from Bombyx mori middle silk glands (MSG) where the sericin-1 (Ser-1) mRNA is produced specifically, we have studied the in vitro transcription of the Ser-1 gene. To determine the sites required for the promoter function of the Ser-1 gene and characterize the factors binding to these sites, the upstream region was dissected. Footprinting assays revealed the presence of at least three specific protein binding sites, SA (-103 to -85), SB (-149 to -135) and SC (-204 to -183). Removal of SA and SC by 5'-deletions decreased the promoter activity. DNase I footprinting using four extracts of B. mori origin indicated that the factor binding to SA is specific to the silk gland extracts, and the factor binding to SC is very much abundant in the MSG extracts. Stimulation of the promoter activity with the region from -239 to -174 that accommodates the SC site, is stronger in MSG extracts than in the extracts from the posterior silk glands. These results suggest that the SC binding factor abundant in MSG may play an important role in the MSG-specific expression of the Ser-1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1494303055,"The present study examines the hormonal regulation male-specific cytochrome P-450g (IIC13) and its mRNA. Neonatal gonadectomy of male rats abolished hepatic expression of P-450g and its mRNA in adulthood, while ovariectomy had little effect. Neonatal administration of testosterone to neonatally gonadectomized male or female rats partially masculinized expression of P-450g and its mRNA, and postpubertal administration of testosterone (testosterone capsules implanted at 5 weeks) completely masculinized their expression. However, castration of male rats at puberty (5 weeks) had no effect on P-450g or its mRNA at 10 weeks. Male-specific development of P-450g and P-450 M-1 (IIC11) mRNA were imprinted similarly by testosterone. However, hypophysectomy experiments demonstrated that the two male-specific forms of P-450 are regulated quite differently. Hypophysectomy of male rats decreased hepatic content of P-450 M-1 mRNA by approximately 50%, and intermittent injections of growth hormone completely restored this mRNA. In contrast, hypophysectomy of male rats increased P-450g and its mRNA by approximately 50%, while intermittent injections of growth hormone produced a slight decrease. Hypophysectomy of female rats increased P-450g and its mRNA to adult male levels, but produced only a small increase in P-450 M-1 mRNA. Continuous infusion of growth hormone into sham hypophysectomized male rats (to mimic the female growth hormone pattern) resulted in a complete loss of P-450g and its mRNA. These results indicate that the expression of P-450g is not dependent on the male pulsatile growth hormone pattern, but suggest instead that the continuous secretion of growth hormone suppresses P-450g in the female rat."
https://openalex.org/W1519016659,"Abstract Serum amyloid A protein (apo-SAA) is an acute-phase reactant and an apolipoprotein of high density lipoproteins (HDL). Six major isoforms of apo-SAA occur in humans (pI 6.0, 6.4, 7.0, 7.4, 7.5, 8.0). In this report we have rationalized the phenotypic expression of apo-SAA isoforms with published apo-SAA structures predicted from apo-SAA cDNA's pA1 and pSAA82 and the genomic DNA SAAg9. The six apo-SAA isoforms fall into three pairs, pI 6.0/6.4, 7.0/7.5, and 7.4/8.0, which are products of cDNA pA1, cDNA pSAA82, and genomic DNA SAAg9, respectively. The second of each isoform pair (i.e. pI 6.4, 7.5, and 8.0) is the product: a 104-residue peptide with the NH2-terminal sequence Arg-Ser-Phe-Phe. Each primary product is processed either to a major 103-residue peptide with the NH2-terminal sequence Ser-Phe-Phe or processed to a minor 102-residue product which results from the loss of both an Arg and a Ser residue from the NH2 termini. These secondary products have the lower pI values of 6.0, 7.0, and 7.4, respectively. The isoelectric points of the SAAg9 products were confirmed by expression of SAAg9 in transfected mouse L-cells. Both the pI 8.0 and 7.4 isoforms were present in cellular extracts, suggesting that post-translational modification of apo-SAA may occur intracellularly. However, the greater relative abundance of the pI 7.4 isoform extracellularly suggests that the major conversion may occur after secretion. Whereas the gene corresponding to the pA1 cDNA sequence does not show allelic variation, the segregation characteristics of the pI 7.0/7.5 and 7.4/8.0 isoform pairs amongst individuals suggests that these isoforms are the products of genes (with sequences corresponding to pSAA82 and SAAg9, respectively) which are allelic variants at a single locus distinct from that for the pI 6.0/6.4 isoform pair."
https://openalex.org/W1565422301,"Abstract A Ca2+-independent sialic acid-specific lectin from two developmental stages of human placenta was similarly purified to apparent homogeneity by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on bovine submaxillary mucin, and gel filtration. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration disclosed a molecular mass of 53 kDa. The specificity of the lectin for O-acetylsialic acids was substantiated by the dependence of hemagglutination on the presence of acetylated sialic acids on the surface of mammalian erythrocytes of various sources, by hapten inhibition in hemagglutination assays with protease-treated rabbit erythrocytes and by hapten inhibition of binding of labeled N-acetylneuraminic acid-bovine serum albumin to the lectin in a solid-phase assay. Bovine and equine submaxillary mucins that contain 9(7,8)-O-acetyl and 4-O-acetylsialic acids were potent inhibitors in contrast to the non-acetylated sialic acids of ovine submaxillary mucin. Absence of inhibitory efficiency of other negatively charged substances like phosphorylated sugars, glucuronic acid, heparin, or oligodeoxynucleotides emphasized the importance of structural features instead of simple ionic interaction. In the presence of acetylation, the pattern of inhibition by gangliosides in the solid-phase assay indicated a preference to alpha-2,8- or alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids in comparison to alpha-2,3-linked moieties. Chemical modification of the lectin by group-specific reagents allowed to emphasize the role of primarily lysine residues, but also, although less pronounced, arginine, tryptophan, and carboxyl groups for ligand binding and/or maintenance of the active conformational state. Application of reagents, specific for histidine or tyrosine residues, failed to affect lectin activity."
https://openalex.org/W1559331481,"The soluble pool of alpha hemoglobin chains present in blood or bone marrow cells was measured with a new affinity method using a specific probe, beta A hemoglobin chain labeled with [3H]N-ethylmaleimide. This pool of soluble alpha chains was 0.067 +/- 0.017% of hemoglobin in blood of normal adult, 0.11 +/- 0.03% in heterozygous beta thalassemia and ranged from 0.26 to 1.30% in homozygous beta thalassemia intermedia. This elevated pool of soluble alpha chains observed in human beta thalassemia intermedia decreased 33-fold from a value of 10% of total hemoglobin in bone marrow cells to 0.3% in the most dense red blood cells. The amount of insoluble alpha chains was measured by using the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in urea and Triton X-100. In beta thalassemia intermedia the amount of insoluble alpha chains was correlated with the decreased spectrin content of red cell membrane and was associated with a decrease in ankyrin and with other abnormalities of the electrophoretic pattern of membrane proteins. The loss and topology of the reactive thiol groups of membrane proteins was determined by using [3H]N-ethylmaleimide added to membrane ghosts prior to urea and Triton X-100 electrophoresis. Spectrin and ankyrin were the major proteins with the most important decrease of thiol groups."
https://openalex.org/W1818288307,"DNA sequence analysis of the pufX region, the most distal gene of the pufBALMX operon of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, revealed a sequence encoding a putative polypeptide of 82 amino acids with a molecular mass of 9052 Da followed by a puf operon-specific transcription terminator. Analysis of the 5' and 3' termini of the transcripts produced in vivo from the puf operon of R. sphaeroides PUF delta 348-420 (three transcripts; 0.59, 0.64, and 2.63 kilobases) lacking the puf-intercistronic terminator structure were identical to those of the corresponding puf transcripts derived from wild-type R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 (four transcripts; 0.50, 0.66, 0.71, and 2.7 kilobases) showing that the transcripts begin and end at the same sites. However, the absence of the puf intercistronic terminator resulted in both the loss of the smallest transcript found in wild type and increased transcriptional read-through of the mutated region to the more distal pufL gene, supporting our previous contention that the proximal intercistronic stem-loop functions as a transcription terminator. The 5' terminus of the medium sized puf transcript has been localized to the same site as that of the small puf transcript. These analyses also showed conclusively that the puf operon-specific transcripts are not extended transcripts derived from the upstream open reading frame Q. In addition, a 120-nucleotide RNA was detected which encompassed the terminator region downstream of pufX and extended into the next downstream open reading frame. The 120-nucleotide RNA of unknown function was regulated by O2 and is unique in its abundance and stability. By comparison with strain 2.4.1, the mutant PUF delta 348-420 showed an increased amount (1.9-fold) of the 120-nucleotide RNA, suggesting that its synthesis is under the control of the puf operon despite the fact that its sequence appears to overlap the next downstream operon."
https://openalex.org/W1582892601,"We have previously described the preparation and use of 9-O-[acetyl-3H]acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid to identify sialic acid O-acetylesterases in tissues and cells (Higa, H. H., Diaz, S., and Varki, A. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 144, 1099-1108). All tissues of the adult rat showed these activities, with the exception of plasma. Rat liver contained two major sialic acid esterases: a cytosolic nonglycosylated enzyme and a membrane-associated glycosylated enzyme. The two enzymes were found in similar proportions and specific activities in a buffer extract of rat liver acetone powder. By using the latter as a source, the two enzymes were separated, and the glycosylated enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by multiple steps, including ConA-Sepharose affinity chromatography and Procion Red-agarose chromatography (yield, 13%; fold purification, approximately 3000). The homogeneous enzyme is a 61.5-kDa disulfide-linked heterodimeric protein, whose serine active site can be labeled with [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Upon reduction, two subunits of 36 kDa and 30 kDa are generated, and the 30-kDa subunit carries the [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate label. The protein has N-linked oligosaccharides that are cleaved by Peptide N-glycosidase F. These chains are cleaved to a much lesser extent by endo-beta-N-acetylglycosaminidase H, indicating that they are mainly complex-type glycans. The enzyme activity has a broad pH optimum range between 6 and 7.5, has no divalent cation requirements, is unaffected by reduction, and is inhibited by the serine active site inhibitors, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Paraoxon). Kinetic studies with various substrates show that the enzyme is specific for sialic acids and selectively cleaves acetyl groups in the 9-position. It shows little activity against a variety of other natural compounds bearing O-acetyl esters. It appears to deacetylate di-O-acetyl- and tri-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acids by first cleaving the O-acetyl ester at the 9-position. The 7- and 8-O-acetyl esters then undergo spontaneous migration to the 9-position, where they can be cleaved, resulting in the production of N-acetylneuraminic acid. In view of its interesting substrate specificity, complex N-linked glycan structure, and neutral pH optimum, it is suggested that this enzyme is involved in the regulation of O-acetylation in membrane-bound sialic acids."
https://openalex.org/W1482116639,"Abstract Novel acidic oligosaccharides were isolated in abnormally large amounts (about 200 ng/egg) from the unfertilized eggs of Tribolodon hakonensis (a dace, ugui in Japanese). The free oligosaccharides were found to consist of a mixture of disialylated species most of which end with beta-mannosyl N-acetylglucosamine structure at their reducing termini, i.e. greater than Man beta 1-4GlcNAc. A minute portion of the sialooligosaccharides was found to have the reducing terminal structure, di-N-acetylchitobiose, i.e. greater than Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc. From the structural analysis of these free sialooligosaccharides, the following structures are proposed: (sequence; see text) Occurrence of such a symmetrically or dissymmetrically branched form of the biantennary nonreducing periphery as revealed here is novel. Although it is unknown why and how such high amounts of free oligosaccharides are accumulated in unfertilized eggs, these were presumably protein-linked components and must be released at certain stages of oogenesis."

To obtain specific binding, monofunctional reagents of the clusters were prepared and were covalently bound to free sulfhydryl groups on the surface of the ribosome. In addition, a mutant of Bacillus stearothermophilus which lacks one ribosomal protein (BL11) was grown. The heavy-atom clusters were covalently bound to isolated protein BL11, and the modified protein was consequently reconstituted into the mutated ribosomal subunits. Crystallographic data have been collected from crystals of native particles, from the mutated ones, and from the iridium- and gold-derivatized subunits. All these crystal forms are isomorphous within the experimental error."
https://openalex.org/W1585184114,"Abstract We investigated the effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) pretreatment on binding to its own receptor. We found that EGF specifically induces a rapid, reversible, and global change in the affinity of surface EGF receptors. Occupancy of only a few (less than 1%) was sufficient to reduce the affinity of the majority of surface receptors by 10 min and a maximal response required only 5% occupancy. The rate at which EGF receptor affinity decreased was essentially independent of the extent of receptor occupancy and occurred with a t 1/2 between 2-2.5 min. Surface receptors remained in the lower affinity state as long as EGF remained present. Removal of EGF resulted in the restoration of receptor affinity with a t 1/2 of about 20 min. Kinetic analyses revealed that the alteration in apparent affinity was due to changes in both the association and dissociation rate constants as well as an increase in the specific internalization rate of the receptor. Treatment of cells with phorbol esters produced a similar affinity drop, but depletion of intracellular protein kinase C did not affect the affinity change induced by EGF. Thus, phorbol esters and EGF mediate their effects through different pathways. EGF reduced the affinity of its own receptors in a variety of cell types including Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing transfected human EGF receptors. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that occupancy of a few receptors on EGF naive cells triggers a global modification/phosphorylation of surface receptors which results in the observed change in affinity. This system is independent of protein kinase C and probably serves to regulate the activity of the EGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1600324646,"Abstract The relationship between histone methylation and the transcriptionally active chromatin state was investigated. Immature chicken erythrocytes, which were obtained from the peripheral blood of anemic birds, were incubated with L-[methyl-3H]methionine and cycloheximide. Under these conditions histones H3 and H4 are methylated. The erythrocyte nuclei were incubated with micrococcal nuclease, and the chromatin fragments were fractionated according to their solubility in EDTA and 0.15 M NaCl. Chromatin fractions, which were enriched in transcriptionally active genes, were enriched in methylated histones. Moreover, the acetylated species of histones H3 and H4, which are complexed with active genes (Hebbes, T. R., Thorne, A. W., and Crane-Robinson, C. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 1395-1402), were preferentially methylated. The methylation of these histones was not dependent on ongoing transcription. The distribution of histone H3 methyltransferase activity among the various chromatin regions was also studied. This enzyme activity was greatest for the chromatin fragments that were enriched in active/competent genes. However, our results suggest that histone H3 methyltransferase is bound to the nucleosome. The enzyme, which may be localized in the active gene chromatin domains, may ensure that the histones associated with active genes are methylated. Histone methylation, which has a slow turnover rate, may contribute to the maintenance of the transcriptionally active chromatin state."

The lipid was shown to contain a phosphatidic acid backbone by digestion with phospholipase A2 and by hydrolysis with hydrofluoric acid. Using a combination of chemical and NMR spectroscopic techniques, the structure of this lipid was elucidated and compared with that of a similar phosphoglycolipid reported earlier (Anderson, R., and Hansen, K.

https://openalex.org/W1494359421,"Abstract Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a potent neuroactive and vasoactive nonapeptide encoded in and processed from a precursor, preproarginine vasopressin-neuro-physin II (preproAVP-NPII). To study the physiologic consequences of a genetic model of chronic hypervasopressinemia transgenic mice were produced by introduction of a mouse metallothionein-rat-ppAVP-NPII fusion gene into the germ line of mice. Three stable transgenic pedigrees were analyzed through several generations. Levels of immunoreactive AVP and neurophysin (NP) in sera, livers, kidneys, intestines, pancreas, and brains were markedly elevated. Chromatographic analyses showed sera levels of approximately 500 pg/ml (normal 0-20 pg/ml) of authentic AVP non-apeptide and serum osmolalities were elevated, 315.4 +/- 1.4 mosm/liter (control, 307.3 +/- 1.1), consistent with a state of mild nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Brain levels of immunoreactive AVP in transgenic mice were 3-4-fold elevated 145 +/- 15 ng/g versus 31 +/- 7 (controls). Although immunoreactive AVP in livers and intestines, and to some extent kidneys, consisted predominantly of unprocessed precursors, in brain and pancreas greater than 90% of AVP consisted of processed bioactive nonapeptide, as determined by chromatography and measurements of cAMP-generation in LLC-PK1 cells. Immunocytochemistry localized immunoreactive AVP to the exocrine pancreas and to the magnacellular neurons (SON and PVN) of the hypothalamus. Expression of the fusion gene in the hypothalamus was further demonstrated by Northern analyses of fusion gene specific transcripts and in situ histohybridization. Although the fusion gene contained only 35 base pairs of 5'-flanking DNA of the ppAVP-NPII gene, a tentative neuronal cell-specific expression element, -17GCCCAG-CC-10 resides in this sequence and may confer neuron-specific expression to the fusion gene."
https://openalex.org/W1540540793,"Abstract Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) stimulates thyroid cell proliferation. Using primary cultured porcine thyroid cells, we studied the intracellular pathways that mediate the action of IGF-I on thyroid cell proliferation. IGF-I stimulates inositol phosphate accumulation, a rise in cytoplasmic free calcium [( Ca2+]i), and cell proliferation. Exposure to IGF-I results in a time- and dose-dependent accumulation of inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate. IGF-I also increases [Ca2+]i, measured using fura-2, a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator; the IGF-I-induced [Ca2+]i response occurs immediately, reaches a maximum within 1 min, and then slowly declines. IGF-I stimulates thyroid cell proliferation, stimulates thymidine incorporation, and increases cell numbers. The IGF-I-induced inositol phosphate accumulation and [Ca2+]i response parallel thyroid cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner; the maximal response is observed at a concentration of 100 ng/ml IGF-I, with half-maximal stimulation at approximately 10 ng/ml. Inositol phosphate accumulation and [Ca2+]i response after IGF-I stimulation may function as intracellular messengers for thyroid cell proliferation. This report may constitute the first demonstration of IGF-I-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation and [Ca2+]i response in the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1509599083,"Abstract 3,5,3'-Triiodo-L-thyronine (L-T3)-binding sites from rat and human red cells were characterized as to their distribution between the two surfaces of the membrane. Analysis of L-T3 binding to sealed right-side-out and inside-out vesicles from erythrocyte membrane revealed that high affinity L-T3-binding sites are located on the external side in rat erythrocytes and on the internal side in human red cells. These results were further confirmed by preincubation of intact red cells with p-chloromercuribenzoate, a slowly permeant reagent that interacts reversibly with SH groups of proteins. Following this treatment only the SH groups of L-T3 sites from rat erythrocytes were found to be blocked. Scatchard analysis of the binding data for rat right-side-out and human inside-out vesicles showed high affinity sites with Kd values of 0.2 x 10(-10) and 2 x 10(-10) M, respectively. The results suggest that the orientation of L-T3-binding sites in the erythrocyte membrane is species-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1507326460,"Abstract Anilinonaphthalenesulfonate (ANS) and tryptophan compete for binding to the trp repressor protein; thus, the fluorescence decrease associated with ANS dissociation can be used as a fluorometric marker for tryptophan binding to the protein. Using this approach, the tryptophan equilibrium dissociation constant was measured at 25 degrees C to be 3.7 (+/- 1.2) X 10(-5) M, a value which compares favorably with that obtained by other methods for determining the affinity of this ligand. The presence of nonspecific DNA had no effect on the binding affinity, whereas addition of trp operator DNA yielded a 6-fold increase in affinity of tryptophan binding. The kinetics of tryptophan binding to the aporepressor were monitored directly and by ANS displacement at 4 degrees C. The association rate constant was approximately 4 X 10(6) M-1 s-1, and the dissociation rate constant was approximately 60 s-1. The ratio of these values agrees with the binding constant determined by equilibrium dialysis at this temperature. Using the gel retardation method (Carey, J. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 975-979), the dissociation rate constant for the 40-base pair operator fragment was estimated to be 2 X 10(-2) s-1, which combines with the measured Kd of 0.3 nM to yield an association rate constant comparable to other DNA binding proteins (approximately 10(8) M-1 s-1)."
https://openalex.org/W1524101826,"Crayfish tail muscle troponin C (TnC) has been fractionated into its five components and the Ca2+-binding properties of the two major isoforms (alpha and gamma) determined by equilibrium dialysis. alpha-TnC contains one Ca2+-binding site with a binding constant of 1 x 10(6) M-1 and one Ca2+ site with a binding constant of 1 x 10(4) M-1. In the complex of alpha-TnC with troponin I (TnI) or with TnI and troponin T (TnT), both sites bind Ca2+ with a single affinity constant of 2-4 x 10(6) M-1. gamma-TnC contains two Ca2+-binding sites with a binding constant of 2 x 10(4) M-1. In the gamma-TnC.TnI and gamma-TnC.TnI.TnT complexes, the binding constant of one of the sites is increased to 4-5 x 10(6) M-1, while Ca2+ binding to the second site is hardly affected (KCa = 4-7 x 10(4) M-1). In the presence of 10 mM MgCl2, the two Ca2+-binding sites of both TnC isoforms exhibit a 2-3-fold lower affinity. Assuming competition between Ca2+ and Mg2+ for these sites, their binding constants for Mg2+ were 120-230 M-1. In the absence of Ca2+, however, alpha-TnC and gamma-TnC bind 4-5 mol of Mg2+/mol with a binding constant of 1 x 10(3) M-1. These results suggest that the effect of Mg2+ on Ca2+ binding at the two Ca2+ sites is noncompetitive, i.e. Mg2+ does not bind directly to these sites (Ca2+-specific sites). Since the formation of the complex of crayfish TnI with alpha-TnC or gamma-TnC increases significantly the affinity of one of their two Ca2+-specific sites, I conclude that the binding of Ca2+ to only one site (regulatory Ca2+-specific site) controls the Ca2+-dependent interaction between crayfish TnCs and TnI."
https://openalex.org/W1642991741,"Signal and stop-transfer sequences are the known determinants involved in topogenesis of integral membrane proteins. To study the characteristics of stop-transfer sequences, artificial proteins have been created on the DNA level based on the cDNA of the asialoglycoprotein receptor H1. Its internal signal/anchor domain initiates translocation of the downstream sequence across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The ability of several hydrophobic sequences inserted into the translocating polypeptide to stop further transfer was analyzed by translation of the fusion proteins using the wheat germ extract and rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems with dog pancreas microsomes. We discovered that some of the sequences behave differently with respect to translocation across the membrane depending on the translation system. Expression of one of the fusion proteins in fibroblasts showed that the reticulocyte lysate system reflects more closely the in vivo situation than the wheat germ system. Our results suggest that in a homologous system the translating ribosomes interact with the translocation machinery and influence the termination of polypeptide transfer by hydrophobic sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1484613385,"Abstract Treatment of Swiss mouse 3T3 cells and human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells with protamine at 37 degrees C increased the 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding activity at 4 degrees C. The effect of protamine on the increase of 125I-EGF binding activity appeared to be time, temperature, and dose dependent. This up-modulation of 125I-EGF binding by protamine correlated with protamine enhancement of EGF-stimulated mitogenesis, with respect to the magnitude of the effect and the dose response curves. Scatchard plot analyses indicated that protamine induced an increase in numbers of both high and low affinity EGF receptors without affecting their affinities. Protamine also increased functionally active EGF receptors in plasma membranes and solubilized membranes. This was evidenced by Scatchard plot analyses and by a protamine-induced increase of 125I-EGF-EGF receptor complex and an increase in EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Combined with column chromatography of the solubilized EGF receptor on protamine-agarose gel, these results suggest that protamine may increase the EGF receptor number by directly activating cryptic EGF receptors in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1520121840,"Abstract In vitro transcription elongation, in HeLa whole cell extract, is partially blocked at the Ad2 and synthetic (8 Ts) attenuation sites when transcription elongation is performed at increasing KCl concentrations (0.2-0.5 M KCl) but not at the standard KCl concentration (50 mM). Furthermore, if briefly initiated transcription complexes are chromatographed on Sephacryl column at increased KCl concentration and the complexes, which are eluted in the void volume, are diluted to 50 mM KCl, they will elongate a substantial fraction of the briefly initiated nascent RNA into attenuated RNA. The addition of a crude preparation of a stimulatory factor to the complexes diluted to 50 mM KCl prevents the elongation blocks. Based on the notion that putative elongation factors dissociate from the transcription complexes at increasing KCl concentrations and in the Sephacryl column they elute after the initiation complexes, we suggest that the column-purified transcription complexes, which have been depleted of elongation factors, can serve as a model system for determining the activities of factors during elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1569187156,"Abstract The effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3), an active form of vitamin D3, on the metabolism of proteoglycans by an osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 were studied. Cells metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate and/or [3H]glucosamine synthesized large and small dermatan sulfate proteoglycans and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. The incorporation of [35S]sulfate into proteoglycans for 1 h was reduced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum reduction of 40% obtained at 10(-8)M 1,25-(OH)2D3. This effect was observed for all the proteoglycans with the decrease for the large dermatan sulfate proteoglycan most prominent. Treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not influence the degree of sulfation nor the molecular size of the glycosaminoglycan chains. Thus, the change in the incorporation of [35S] sulfate reflects net change in the synthesis of proteoglycans. When cells were treated with beta-D-xyloside, 1,25-(OH)2D3 also inhibited net synthesis of dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains on this exogenous substrate suggesting that it decreases the capacity of the cells for glycosaminoglycan synthesis. The incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into hyaluronic acid was also inhibited up to 70% by 10(-8) M 1,25-(OH)2D3. Treatment with 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 did not cause significant changes in the proteoglycan synthesis. Degradation of proteoglycans associated with the cell layer was enhanced by treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 at 10(-8) M. Proteoglycans exogenously added to the culture were also degraded with a cell-mediated process which was stimulated by treatment with 10(-8) M 1,25-(OH)2D3. These results demonstrate that 1,25-(OH)2D3 reduces the synthesis and stimulates the degradation of proteoglycans in osteoblastic cells in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1581474454,"Abstract A tetracoordinate ferrous heme (iron-porphyrin) has been proposed as an intermediate at low pH (less than 3.0) for respiratory hemoproteins, peroxidases, and model heme complexes. This intermediate is believed to arise via protonation of the N(epsilon) atom of the proximal histidine and consequent cleavage of the Fe-N(epsilon) bond. To establish a spectral signature for the proposed low-pH tetracoordinate species, we have obtained Soret excitation resonance Raman spectra on samples of crystallographically defined, tetracoordinate iron(II)-octaethylporphyrin (Fe.OEP; S = 1). The high-frequency (greater than or equal to 900 cm-1) resonance Raman spectral features of Fe.OEP are clearly distinct from those of high-spin pentacoordinate or low-spin hexacoordinate ferrous hemes. Rather, they are at frequencies more typically observed for low-spin hexacoordinate ferric porphyrins. Comparative spectral analysis of tetracoordinate Fe.OEP and other proposed tetracoordinate ferrous hemes (e.g. iron(II)-protoporphyrin IX) demonstrates little or no macrocycle effect on the resonance Raman frequencies above 900 cm-1. This work thus serves to provide a testable spectral signature by which the existence of the proposed tetracoordinate biological intermediate may be verified and by which its functional significance may be tested."
https://openalex.org/W1481512237,"Abstract Cell-free translation of beta-tubulin mRNA generates full length beta-tubulin polypeptides distributed in three molecular forms: a high molecular weight lysate-associated form, the free beta-tubulin subunit, and the alpha beta-heterodimer (Yaffe, M.B., Farr, G. W., and Sternlicht, H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16023-16031). A quantitative assay system for these three forms was developed and used to measure the rates of incorporation/exchange of the newly synthesized free beta-subunit and the high molecular weight form into tubulin heterodimers following incubation of the 35S-translation products with unlabeled bovine tubulin dimer. This exchange process was found to be slow and strongly temperature-dependent. The half-lives for exchange ranged from 12.5 min at 37 degrees C to 17.5 h at 0 degree C with a measured activation energy of 22.5 kcal/mol. Microtubule-associated proteins appeared to play no role in the exchange process, since identical exchange rates were observed regardless of whether microtubule protein or phosphocellulose-purified tubulin was used as the source of tubulin dimer. Surprisingly, the exchange rates were found to be independent of dimer concentration. We interpret these results as evidence for a rate-limiting, slow conformational change that occurs within the newly synthesized beta-subunits prior to their association with alpha-tubulin to generate the alpha beta-hetero-dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1527494449,"The mapping and nucleotide sequencing of the rpS15 gene in the rye chloroplast DNA has shown that it is located in the inverted repeat (IR) and thus has two copies/genome. This is in contrast to tobacco and liverwort chloroplasts where rpS15 occurs as single-copy gene localized in the small single copy region (SSC). The direction of transcription of both gene copies in rye is toward SSC; that in tobacco and liverwort is toward IR-II. Further sequence data have revealed that the 3' end of each rye rpS15 gene copy is only 352 base pairs away from the corresponding IR.SSC junction and that this rearrangement event in rye involves also a 3' downstream-encoded and highly conserved chloroplast gene designated ORF393 in tobacco and ORF392 in liverwort. The latter in rye starts in both the IRs, but continues to full length into the SSC only from the IR-II. The direction of transcription of the nontruncated gene is fixed toward IR-I, being thus the inverse of ORF393/392 in tobacco and liverwort. Northern blot analysis has shown that the rearranged rpS15 gene is actively transcribed in rye chloroplasts and etioplasts and that its transcription pattern is different from that recently reported for tobacco rpS15."
https://openalex.org/W2118641298,"DNA sequences involved in the expression of the agropine synthase gene (ags) of T-DNA were identified by analysis of transcriptional activity of promoter mutants in crown gall tumors of sunflower. Precise quantification of activity was achieved using a homologous reference gene as an internal standard. Analysis of 5′-deletion mutants demonstrated the requirement of 314 base pairs of upstream DNA sequences for optimal activity. Five regions involved in transcriptional regulation were identified in the 5′-flanking sequences between positions −74 and −314. Four of these regions make a positive contribution to promoter activity, and the fifth exerts a negative influence. The TATA motif (−26 to −33) and the TATA proximal domain (−74 to −105), which contains two sequences similar to the mammalian CCAAT box, are the major determinants of promoter activity. The two TATA distal domains A and B are separated by a negative element (−166 to −205) which may attenuate promoter strength by distancing the TATA distal domain B (−206 to −314 base pairs) from downstream components of the promoter. The TATA distal domain B contains the a/b repeat first described in the nopaline synthase (nos) promoter and was unable to support transcription in the absence of elements within the TATA proximal domain."
https://openalex.org/W1503395979,"Abstract Phospholipases in some snake venoms are potent neurotoxins that target their enzymatic action to the synaptic membrane. One of these is the heterodimeric neurotoxin, beta-bungarotoxin, which binds with a protease inhibitor-like subunit to a presynaptic potassium channel and then blocks neurotransmission with a second subunit that has phospholipase A2 activity. We have prepared and characterized well ordered crystals of the most toxic beta-bungarotoxin isoform, beta 1-bungarotoxin. The crystals are monoclinic, space group C2, with unit cell parameters: a = 176.5 A, b = 39.3 A, c = 92.7 A, and beta = 114.8 degrees. Rotation-function analysis of the Patterson function, as calculated from a 2.3-A data set, reveals an asymmetric unit composed of four heterodimers. These heterodimers appear to be associated as two crystallographically distinct (AB)4 tetramers, each having dihedral D2 symmetry. The two are positioned with equivalent molecular 2-fold axes coincident with crystallographic dyads, but rotated by 55 degrees relative to one another. X-ray analysis of these crystals will permit direct visualization of the specific structural motifs and chemical features that underlie phospholipase neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1576340016,"A unique tRNA(Ser)-tRNA(Met) tandem gene arrangement was characterized previously from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Three alleles exist in which a tRNA(Ser) gene is separated by 7 base pairs from an initiator tRNA(Met) gene. Promotion of transcription occurs only within the tRNA(Ser) gene, yielding a dimeric precursor transcript. Using nuclease protection and gel retardation assays, we have analyzed how the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase III transcription factor C (TFIIIC) interacts with this dimeric gene template. The primary interaction site of TFIIIC with the tRNA(Ser) gene is at the 3'-internal control region (ICR), which can be distinguished kinetically from its weaker interaction with the 5'-ICR of the gene. We examined a variety of point mutations and double mutations within the tRNA(Ser) gene which reduce transcription. We found that changes in highly conserved nucleotides within the ICRs reduce TFIIIC binding up to 7-fold compared with the parent suppressor gene. The interaction of TFIIIC with the tRNA(Ser) gene does not sterically prevent stable binding of TFIIIC to the 3'-ICR of the tRNA(Met) gene. However, the affinity of binding of TFIIIC to the dimeric template is 7-fold higher than to the tRNA(Met) gene, alone, demonstrating that the tRNA(Met) gene contains intrinsically weak promoter elements. This may contribute to the inability of the tRNA(Met) gene to independently direct transcription from its ICR elements."
