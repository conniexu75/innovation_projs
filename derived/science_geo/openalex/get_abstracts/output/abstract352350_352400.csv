https://openalex.org/W1993003564,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor best known for mediating the toxicity of dioxin. Environmental factors are believed to contribute to the increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases, many of which are due to the activity of T(H)17 T cells, a new helper T-cell subset characterized by the production of the cytokine IL-17. Here we show that in the CD4+ T-cell lineage of mice AHR expression is restricted to the T(H)17 cell subset and its ligation results in the production of the T(H)17 cytokine interleukin (IL)-22. AHR is also expressed in human T(H)17 cells. Activation of AHR by a high-affinity ligand during T(H)17 cell development markedly increases the proportion of T(H)17 T cells and their production of cytokines. CD4+ T cells from AHR-deficient mice can develop T(H)17 cell responses, but when confronted with AHR ligand fail to produce IL-22 and do not show enhanced T(H)17 cell development. AHR activation during induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis causes accelerated onset and increased pathology in wild-type mice, but not AHR-deficient mice. AHR ligands may therefore represent co-factors in the development of autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2058816652,"Tribolium castaneum is a member of the most species-rich eukaryotic order, a powerful model organism for the study of generalized insect development, and an important pest of stored agricultural products. We describe its genome sequence here. This omnivorous beetle has evolved the ability to interact with a diverse chemical environment, as shown by large expansions in odorant and gustatory receptors, as well as P450 and other detoxification enzymes. Development in Tribolium is more representative of other insects than is Drosophila, a fact reflected in gene content and function. For example, Tribolium has retained more ancestral genes involved in cell-cell communication than Drosophila, some being expressed in the growth zone crucial for axial elongation in short-germ development. Systemic RNA interference in T. castaneum functions differently from that in Caenorhabditis elegans, but nevertheless offers similar power for the elucidation of gene function and identification of targets for selective insect control."

https://openalex.org/W1993579134,"The neuronal repressor protein REST (also known as NRSF) maintains self renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells through suppression of the miRNA-21, and is therefore a newly identified member of the transcriptional network maintaining stem cells in a pluripotent state. Knocking down its activity by using of siRNA or deletion of one allele caused loss of self renewal and led the cells to express differentiated markers. The neuronal repressor REST (RE1-silencing transcription factor; also called NRSF) is expressed at high levels in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells1, but its role in these cells is unclear. Here we show that REST maintains self-renewal and pluripotency in mouse ES cells through suppression of the microRNA miR-21. We found that, as with known self-renewal markers, the level of REST expression is much higher in self-renewing mouse ES cells than in differentiating mouse ES (embryoid body, EB) cells. Heterozygous deletion of Rest (Rest+/-) and its short-interfering-RNA-mediated knockdown in mouse ES cells cause a loss of self-renewal—even when these cells are grown under self-renewal conditions—and lead to the expression of markers specific for multiple lineages. Conversely, exogenously added REST maintains self-renewal in mouse EB cells. Furthermore, Rest+/- mouse ES cells cultured under self-renewal conditions express substantially reduced levels of several self-renewal regulators, including Oct4 (also called Pou5f1), Nanog, Sox2 and c-Myc, and exogenously added REST in mouse EB cells maintains the self-renewal phenotypes and expression of these self-renewal regulators. We also show that in mouse ES cells, REST is bound to the gene chromatin of a set of miRNAs that potentially target self-renewal genes. Whereas mouse ES cells and mouse EB cells containing exogenously added REST express lower levels of these miRNAs, EB cells, Rest+/- ES cells and ES cells treated with short interfering RNA targeting Rest express higher levels of these miRNAs. At least one of these REST-regulated miRNAs, miR-21, specifically suppresses the self-renewal of mouse ES cells, corresponding to the decreased expression of Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and c-Myc. Thus, REST is a newly discovered element of the interconnected regulatory network that maintains the self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2116896168,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that regulates myriad important cellular processes, including growth, survival, cytoskeleton rearrangements, motility, and immunity. Here we report that treatment of Jurkat and U937 leukemia cells with the pan-sphingosine kinase (SphK) inhibitor N,N-dimethylsphingosine to block S1P formation surprisingly caused a large increase in expression of SphK1 concomitant with induction of apoptosis. Another SphK inhibitor, D,L-threo-dihydrosphingosine, also induced apoptosis and produced dramatic increases in SphK1 expression. However, up-regulation of SphK1 was not a specific effect of its inhibition but rather was a consequence of apoptotic stress. The chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin, a potent inducer of apoptosis in these cells, also stimulated SphK1 expression and activity and promoted S1P secretion. The caspase inhibitor ZVAD reduced not only doxorubicin-induced lethality but also the increased expression of SphK1 and secretion of S1P. Apoptotic cells secrete chemotactic factors to attract phagocytic cells, and we found that S1P potently stimulated chemotaxis of monocytic THP-1 and U937 cells and primary monocytes and macrophages. Collectively, our data suggest that apoptotic cells may up-regulate SphK1 to produce and secrete S1P that serves as a ""come-and-get-me"" signal for scavenger cells to engulf them in order to prevent necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2068925084,"SWI/SNF, an evolutionarily conserved ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, has an important role in transcriptional regulation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SWI/SNF regulates the expression of approximately 6% of total genes through activation or repression. Swi1, a subunit of SWI/SNF, contains an N-terminal region rich in glutamine and asparagine, a notable feature shared by all characterized yeast prions--a group of unique proteins capable of self-perpetuating changes in conformation and function. Here we provide evidence that Swi1 can become a prion, [SWI+]. Swi1 aggregates in [SWI+] cells but not in nonprion cells. Cells bearing [SWI+] show a partial loss-of-function phenotype of SWI/SNF. [SW+] can be eliminated by guanidine hydrochloride treatment, HSP104 deletion or loss of Swi1. Moreover, we show [SWI+] is dominantly and cytoplasmically transmitted. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of 'protein-only' inheritance that results in modification of chromatin-remodeling and, ultimately, global gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2033471108,"We previously reported that glutamine was a major source of carbon for de novo fatty acid synthesis in a brown adipocyte cell line. The pathway for fatty acid synthesis from glutamine may follow either of two distinct pathways after it enters the citric acid cycle. The glutaminolysis pathway follows the citric acid cycle, whereas the reductive carboxylation pathway travels in reverse of the citric acid cycle from alpha-ketoglutarate to citrate. To quantify fluxes in these pathways we incubated brown adipocyte cells in [U-(13)C]glutamine or [5-(13)C]glutamine and analyzed the mass isotopomer distribution of key metabolites using models that fit the isotopomer distribution to fluxes. We also investigated inhibitors of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial citrate export. The results indicated that one third of glutamine entering the citric acid cycle travels to citrate via reductive carboxylation while the remainder is oxidized through succinate. The reductive carboxylation flux accounted for 90% of all flux of glutamine to lipid. The inhibitor studies were compatible with reductive carboxylation flux through mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase. Total cell citrate and alpha-ketoglutarate were near isotopic equilibrium as expected if rapid cycling exists between these compounds involving the mitochondrial membrane NAD/NADP transhydrogenase. Taken together, these studies demonstrate a new role for glutamine as a lipogenic precursor and propose an alternative to the glutaminolysis pathway where flux of glutamine to lipogenic acetyl-CoA occurs via reductive carboxylation. These findings were enabled by a new modeling tool and software implementation (Metran) for global flux estimation."

https://openalex.org/W2034880481,"Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) has been recognized as an angiogenic chemokine. The molecular mechanism of MCP-1-mediated angiogenesis remains unknown. We recently identified a novel transcription factor, designated MCP-1-induced protein (MCPIP), in human monocytes after treatment with MCP-1. We investigated whether MCP-1-induced angiogenesis is mediated via MCPIP. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with MCP-1 induced expression of MCPIP and capillary-like tube formation.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels in adult tissue, is a key process involved in inflammatory diseases such as diabetes, ischemic heart, and limb diseases and tumor growth (1Griffioen A.W. Molema G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 237-268PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pandya N.M. Dhalla N.S. Santani D.D. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2006; 44: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Although the critical initiating event for the generation of new blood vessels has been attributed to the production of growth factors, recruitment of monocytes has been suggested to be important in the angiogenic cascade (3Arras M.

Res. 1997; 80: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Administration of exogenous MCP-1 has been shown to increase monocyte/macrophage recruitment, collateral vessel formation, and blood flow to the ischemic tissue in hindlimb models of ischemia (6Ito W.D. Arras M. Winkler B. Scholz D. Schaper J. Schaper W. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 7Voskuil M. von Royen N. Hoefer I.E. Seidler R. Guth B.D. Bode C.

Biophys. 2005; 43: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By drilling tunnels through myocardial tissue, monocytes/macrophages were reported to increase angiogenesis in ischemic myocardium (9Moldovan N.I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Parker-Thornburg J. Shapiro S.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). MCP-1 can also directly act on endothelial cells (ECs) to induce angiogenesis (10Salcedo R. Ponce M.L. Young H.A. Wasserman K. Ward J.M. Kleinman H.K. Oppenhein J.J. Murphy W.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 34-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hong K.H. Ryu J. Han K.H. Blood. 2005; 105: 1405-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which MCP-1 mediates these effects on angiogenesis are unclear.We recently identified a novel transcription factor, designated MCP-1-induced protein (MCPIP), which was originally found in human monocytes after treatment with MCP-1 and is proapoptotic (12Zhou L. Azfer A. Niu J. Graham S. Choudhury M. Adamski F.M. Younce C. Binkley P.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MCP-1 induces this transcription factor, which in turn up-regulates members of the apoptotic gene family that have been linked to angiogenesis and vascular remodeling (13Peters K. Troyer D. Kummer S. Kirkpatrick C.J. Rauterberg J. Microvasc. Res. 2002; 64: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Tertemiz F. Kayisl U.A. Aric A. Demir R. Biol.

Therefore, it appeared possible that MCP-1-induced angiogenesis might be mediated by transcription factor MCPIP. Here, we report that MCP-1 treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) resulted in induction of MCPIP and that expression of MCPIP enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and expression of angiogenesis-related genes, resulting in capillary-like tube formation. All of these angiogenic effects of MCP-1 and expression of MCPIP were inhibited by MCPIP-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that cadherin (cdh)12 and cdh19 were in vivo targets of MCPIP. Knockdown of MCPIP expression significantly reduced transcript levels of cdh12 and cdh19. Moreover, knockdown of either cdh12 or cdh19 expression inhibited MCPIP-induced capillary-like tube formation. These results strongly suggest that MCP-1-induced angiogenesis is mediated via induction of MCPIP, the newly discovered transcription factor, at least in part through transcriptional activation of cdh12 and cdh19 that have not previously been implicated in angiogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture Conditions—The HUVECs (Clonetics) were grown in endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), bovine brain extract (12 μg/ml), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), amphotericin B (50 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), and 2% fetal bovine serum (EGM Single Quots, Clonetics) as recommended by the manufacturer. HUVECs were used between passages 4 and 8. The cell line HEK293 was grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2.Plasmid Construction and Transfection—The human MCPIP cDNA encoding the full-length MCPIP (GenBank™ accession number: AY920403) was cloned into BamH1 and EcoR1 sites of a pEGFP/N1 vector to generate the GFP-MCPIP fusion protein as described previously (12Zhou L. Azfer A. Niu J. Graham S. Choudhury M. Adamski F.M. Younce C. Binkley P.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of MCPIP plasmid in HUVECs was performed using Lipofectamine PLUS Reagents (Invitrogen) with a transfection efficiency of about 60–70%, as determined by the green fluorescence.Knockdown with siRNA—HUVECs, fourth generation, were cultured in EGM BulletKit medium (Cambrex) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Human MCPIP SMART pools designed by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) were delivered into 70% confluent cells with the use of Lipofectamine™ and PLUS™ Reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Human MCPIP siRNA SMART pools targeting the sense sequence 5′-GUAAGAAGCCACUCACUUUUU-3′, 5′-GCAAGCGGGUGGUGUGCUAUU-3′, 5′-CCAACACGGUGCUGGGUGAUU-3′, 5′-AUACUAAGCUGUGUGGUGUUU-3′, and the antisense sequence 5′-AAAGUGAGUGGCUUCUUACUU-3′, 5′-UAGCACACCACCCGCUUGCUU-3′, 5′-UCACCCAGCACCGUGUUGGUU-3′, 5′-ACACCACACAGCUUAGUAUUU-3′ were selected. Human cdh12 siRNA SMART pools targeting the sense sequence 5′-GAGACAACGUCAUCCAUUAUU-3′, 5′-GGACAGCUACUUUACAAUAUU-3′, 5′-GGGCAACAAUUCUCCUUUAUU-3′, 5′-GCAGUAUAAUUUCUCCAUAUU-3′, and the antisense sequence 5′-UAAUGGAUGACGUUGUCUCUU-3′, 5′-UAUUGUAAAGUAGCUGUCCUU-3′, 5′-UAAAGGAGAAUUGUUGCCCUU-3′, 5′-UAUGGAGAAAUUAUACUGCUU-3′ were selected. Human cdh19 siRNA SMART pools targeting the sense sequence 5′-UAGGAACAAUCAUGGCAUAUU-3′, 5′-GAUAAUGGUACAAUCACUAUU-3′, 5′-GCUGAGGAGUAGUACCAUAUU-3′, 5′-CCAGCUAAGAUCUGAUUUAUU-3′ and the antisense sequence 5′-UAUGCCAUGAUUGUUCCUAUU-3′, 5′-UAGUGAUUGUACCAUUAUCUU-3′, 5′-UAUGGUACUACUCCUCAGCUU-3′, 5′-UAAAUCAGAUCUUAGCUGGUU-3′ were selected. HUVECs (5 × 104 cells/per well) were washed with Opti-MEM® I medium and incubated with Opti-MEM® I medium containing Lipofectamine/siRNA mixture (final concentration 100 nm of siRNA) for 6 h. Then, 2 ml of fresh EBM complete medium were added, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. To verify specificity of the knockdown effect, we used an oligonucleotide sequence 5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA-3′ (Dharmacon) with no known mammalian target as nonspecific siRNA.Cell Migration Assays—The cell migration assay was performed as described previously (16Myers C. Charboneau A. Boudreau N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs (5 × 104 cells/per well) were seeded into 6-well plates and grown to confluence. The cell monolayer was scratched with a plastic pipette tip to generate a cut of ∼1 mm in width, and the unattached cells were removed by washing twice. The remaining cells were transfected with the expression vector and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. The number of cells that had migrated across the edge of the wound and into the denuded area was photographed and counted as migrating cells using the Metamorph Series 6.2 image program (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Results were expressed as the average number of cells per field of view. The experiment was repeated three times.BrdU Incorporation Assays—To determine the effect of MCPIP on cell proliferation, the rate of DNA synthesis was established by measuring BrdU incorporation in control and transfected HUVECs seeded in 8-well chamber glass slides. After incubation for 6 h with 10 μm BrdU, cells were fixed for 10 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with an anti-BrdU antibody (Novus) for 60 min followed by staining with anti-rat IgG Cy2 antibody (1:500 dilution, Chemicon, Inc) for 30 min. The percentage of BrdU-positive nuclei (red) was determined by counting five randomly selected fields under ×20 magnification using the Metamorph Series 6.2 image program. The experiment was repeated three times.In Vitro Capillary-like Tube Formation Assays—The ability of MCPIP to enhance HUVECs to form vascular network was tested in a standardized in vitro angiogenesis assay. Briefly, after transfection, HUVECs were harvested and seeded onto the surface of the polymerized fibril gels (1 × 104 cells/per well, Chemicon, Inc.) in 96-well plates, then incubated in EBM medium for 24 h. Tube formation was observed under a phase contrast microscope and photographed. Tube formation ability was quantified by counting the total number of cell clusters and branching in five randomly chosen microscopic fields per well under ×100 magnification. Results were expressed as the mean percentage of branching over total cell clusters and expressed as a ratio to the control. The experiment was repeated three times.To examine whether MCP-1-induced angiogenic activity is mediated via MCPIP, HUVECs were incubated in EBM medium with the presence or absence of 100 nm of MCPIP siRNA. Then 100 ng/ml of the recombinant human MCP-1 were added to the medium for 24 h. Capillary-like tube formation was assayed as described above.Detection of Apoptotic Cell Death in HUVECs—HUVECs (5 × 104/per well) were seeded onto 4-well chamber glass slides and were grown to confluence. After transfection with the MCPIP-GFP expression vector or GFP control for 24 h, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and then pretreated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate. The TUNEL assay was performed utilizing a TMR red in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) per the manufacturer's instructions, and counterstaining of all nuclei was done with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Molecular Probes). The number of TUNEL-positive cells were counted and divided by the total number of cells in ten randomly selected fields of view under the fluorescence microscope. The experiment was repeated three times.Gene Expression Profiling by Oligo GEArray Microarray— Angiogenesis-related gene expression profiling was performed using Oligo GEArray human angiogenesis microarray (Biosciences Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from HUVECs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The biotin UTP-labeled cDNA probes were generated using 3 μg of total RNA. The array filters were hybridized with 6 μg of biotin-labeled probes at 60 °C overnight in the hybridization oven. GEArray membranes were washed and blocked with GEArray blocking solution, then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). Signal quantification of gene expression on the array was performed with the software supplied by the manufacturer.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Gel Retardation Assays—ChIP analysis was done essentially as described previously (17Nelson E.A. Walker S.R. Alvarez J.V. Frank D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54724-54730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells (3 × 107), transfected with pEGFP/N1 or pEGFP/MCPIP vector, were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and then lysed with lysis buffer (10 mmol/liter EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1) followed by sonication for 15 s (Sonifire 450, Branson). The sheared preparations were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against MCPIP overnight at 4 °C. The immune complex was recovered with A/G beads, and cross-linking was reversed. After removal of the protein by treatment with proteinase K, DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform and precipitated with sodium acetate. The recovered DNA was cloned into PCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The sequences were located in the genome data base. Genes that were within 5 kb from the cloned sequence were identified. The expression of these candidate genes in HEK293 cells by transfection with MCPIP-GFP construct compared with GFP control was determined by RT-PCR with the following primers: cdh12, forward: 5′-AGGAGGTGGGGAGGAAGATA-3′, reverse: 5′-CATATGTGGCCAGTGAATCG-3′; cdh19, forward: 5′-ATCTGCACCCACTGGGACTT-3′, reverse: 5′-CTGCTCAGGAACATGATGG-3′. The cloned fragments from these candidate genes were tested for binding to the recombinant MCPIP by gel retardation assays as we described previously (18Kamper J.T. Kamper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 32P-labeled probe, 2 μg of poly(dI:dC), 0.3 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 0.4 μg of purified MCPIP protein, ∼ 2 fmol of 32P-labeled probe with or without 100- or 300-fold molar excess of specific/nonspecific competitors. The mixtures were incubated for 25 min at room temperature before electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography of the dried gel.RT-PCR and Real-time PCR Assays—Total RNA was isolated from HUVECs using TRIzol reagent. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and was then amplified by PCR with the following primers: MCPIP, forward: 5′-AGTCTGACGGGATCGTGGTT-3′, reverse: 5′-GGGAGACGTACGGGAGTGAG-3′; cdh12, forward: 5′-AGGAGGTGGGGAGGAAGATA-3′, reverse: 5′-CATATGTGGCCAGTGAATCG-3′; cdh19, forward: 5′-ATCTGCACCCACTGGGACTT-3′, reverse: 5′-CTGCTCAGGAACATGATGG-3′; HIF-α, forward: 5′-TCTGGATGCTGGTGATTTGG-3′, reverse: 5′-GTGAATGTGGCCTGTGCAGT-3′; VE Cadherin, forward: 5′-GTGTTCACGCATCGGTTGTT-3′, reverse: 5′-GGCTCATCTGGGTCCTCAAC-3′; VEGF, forward: 5′-CCCTGGCTTTACTGCTGTAC-3′, reverse: 5′-TCTGAACAAGGCTCACAGTG-3′. The PCR reaction consisted of 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 10 min. β-Actin (forward: 5′-AAATCGTGCGTGACATCAAAG-3′, reverse 5′-TGTAGTTTCATGGATGCCACAG-3′) was amplified as an internal control. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and analyzed using the imaging system (Alphaimager 2200). To confirm the results of RT-PCR, mRNA expression was also analyzed using iCycler real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad) with the use of the above primers for MCPIP, cdh12, cdh19, VE-cadherin, HIF-α, and VEGF. The expression level of each candidate gene was normalized by subtracting the corresponding β-actin threshold cycle (CT) values.Western Blotting—HUVECs in culture under different experimental conditions were lysed, and the cell lysate was collected. An equal amount of protein (25 μg) from each condition was subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was carried out using the indicated primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-MCPIP antibody (12Zhou L. Azfer A. Niu J. Graham S. Choudhury M. Adamski F.M. Younce C. Binkley P.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Circ.

RT-PCR analysis revealed increased levels of MCPIP transcripts in HUVECs after treatment with MCP-1 (Fig. 1A). Real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis confirmed the up-regulated expression of MCPIP at both transcript and protein levels, respectively (Fig. 1, B–D). Both MCPIP mRNA and protein expression induced by MCP-1 in HUVECs were suppressed by treatment with siRNA specific for MCPIP, but not by nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 1, A–D). These results demonstrate that MCP-1 induced expression of MCPIP in HUVECs and effective knockdown of MCPIP by MCPIP-specific siRNA.We examined the potential role of MCPIP in the control of MCP-1-induced angiogenesis using the in vitro angiogenesis assay. HUVECs treated with MCP-1 showed significantly increased numbers of capillary-like tube formation, and this tube formation was inhibited by the knockdown of MCPIP with siRNA for MCPIP, whereas nonspecific siRNA showed no effect (Fig. 1, E and F).The effects of knockdown of MCPIP on the expression profile of MCP-1-induced angiogenesis-related genes were also examined using the Oligo GEArray human angiogenesis microarray, which contained a total of 113 genes that are involved in modulating angiogenesis (19Oettgen P.

As summarized in Table 1, 32 of 113 genes were up-regulated in MCP-1-treated HUVECs compared with untreated-HUVECs (only genes whose expression was induced at least 2.0-fold are included). These up-regulated genes included angiopoietin-like 3, angiopoietin-like 4, VE-cadherin, the VEGF family, Tie-1, ephrin A2, MMP-1, TIMP-2, urokinase, and chemokine ligands. The addition of siRNA for MCPIP suppressed MCP-1-induced expression of most of these genes (Table 1).TABLE 1Expression profile of angiogenesis-related genes in HUVECs treatment with MCP-1- and MCPIP-specific siRNA + MCP-1Gene nameFold inductionaOnly genes whose expression was induced at least 2.0-fold are included.

Ryu J. Han K.H. Blood. 2005; 105: 1405-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The findings that siRNA for MCPIP suppressed MCP-1-induced expression of VEGF (Table 1) strongly suggest MCP-1-induced VEGF expression is mediated via MCPIP. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that MCP-1 induced HIF-1α and VEGF production in HUVECs and siRNA for MCPIP, but not nonspecific siRNA, suppressed the MCP-1-induced HIF-1α and VEGF expression (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, transfection of HUVECs with MCPIP-GFP expression vector, but not GFP control, induced HIF-1α and VEGF production (Fig. 2, A and B).FIGURE 2Real-time PCR analysis of HIF-α (A) and VEGF (B) expression in HUVECs treated with MCP-1 with or without MCPIP-specific or nonspecific siRNA. *, p < 0.05 for treatment with MCP-1 and with nonspecific siRNA. #, p < 0.05 versus GFP vector-transfected HUVECs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of MCPIP Up-regulates Angiogenesis-related Genes and Promotes Capillary-like Tube Formation by HUVECs—We next examined whether expression of MCPIP in HUVECs directly up-regulates angiogenesis-related genes and induces angiogenesis. When HUVECs were transfected with MCPIP-GFP vector, the increased expression of MCPIP was found after 24 h at both mRNA and protein levels as measured by real-time PCR and immunoblot analyses, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). When RNA harvested from GFP- or MCPIP-GFP-expressing HUVECs was subjected to angiogenesis gene array analysis, we observed that MCPIP induced up-regulation of 31 of 113 genes that are known to contribute to the increased angiogenic properties of endothelial cells (Table 2). These up-regulated genes included ephrin A1, ephrin B2, ephrin A3, IL-1β, notch homolog 4, angiopoietin-2, neuropilin-1, urokinase, PDGF-α, TIMP-2, MMP-9, and chemokine ligands. When HUVECs transfected with MCPIP were planted onto the surface of the polymerized fibrin gels for 24 h, we observed the typical capillary-like tube formation, whereas no significant angiogenic responses were observed in HUVECs transfected with the GFP expression control plasmid (Fig. 3C). Quantitative analysis of tube formation showed that tube formation in HUVECs transfected with MCPIP-GFP was much higher than that observed with GFP control (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that expression of MCPIP can directly induce endothelial cell capillary-like tube formation.FIGURE 3Expression of MCPIP induces capillary-like tube formation in HUVECs.

This process begins with the formation of endothelial cell sprouts initiated by apoptosis, followed by the proliferation and migration of neighboring endothelial cells along preformed extensions (15Duval H.

As MCPIP can induce capillary-like tube formation, we tested whether MCPIP might enhance angiogenesis-related properties of HUVECs. After 24 h of incubation, HUVECs transfected with MCPIP-GFP displayed significantly increased cell migration compared with cells transfected with GFP control (Fig. 4, A and B). DNA synthesis, as determined by BrdU incorporation, was also compared in HUVECs transfected with MCPIP-GFP or the GFP control. Results showed that MCPIP caused increased DNA synthesis (Fig. 4C). TUNEL assay and DAPI counterstaining were performed to detect apoptotic cell death in HUVECs after transfection with MCPIP-GFP expression vector or GFP control.

Fetuin-A is highly effective in the formation and stabilization of protein-mineral colloids, referred to as calciprotein particles (CPPs). These particles ripen in vitro in a two-step process, indicated by a morphological conversion from spheres to larger prolate ellipsoids. Using a combined light scattering and electron microscopic imaging approach we determined that the second-stage particles resulted from a highly anisotropic outgrowth of the first-stage particles. Electron microscopy of ascites fluid from a patient with calcifying peritonitis revealed particles reminiscent of secondary CPPs. Thus, CPPs form in the body and undergo the two-step ripening at least in pathological conditions. Unlike in vitro generated CPPs, ascites-derived CPPs contained little fetuin-A but large amounts of albumin. This prompted us to study the role of fetuin-A combined with other serum proteins in CPP formation. Fetuin-A was indispensable for primary CPP formation. Albumin and acidic proteins in general greatly enhanced the fetuin-A triggered formation of secondary CPPs and, thus, substituted substantial amounts of fetuin-A without loss of inhibition of calcium phosphate precipitation. Thus, direct mineral deposition from solute in the body is unlikely even at low fetuin-A serum levels as long as sufficient bulk acidic protein is available. Collectively fetuin-A and other acidic bulk plasma proteins may be considered as mineral chaperones mediating the stabilization, safe transport, and clearance in the body of calcium and phosphate as colloidal complexes, thus, preventing ectopic calcification.

In vertebrates all extracellular fluids are supersaturated with respect to the mineral-forming ions calcium and phosphate. Local supersaturation may even be much higher than the ion concentrations in blood indicate, for instance in the bone remodeling compartment or in kidney epithelia. Thus, potent inhibitors of spontaneous salt precipitation that counteract this thermodynamic driving force are essential. Otherwise uncontrolled mineral deposition in the blood or in the soft tissue would inevitably occur causing ectopic calcification. Several different types of calcification inhibitors and mechanisms are known. For example, small molecules and ions like pyrophosphate, citrate, or magnesium (1Wilson J.W. Werness P.G. Smith L.H. J. Urol. 1985; 134: 1255-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) slow down crystal growth by interfering with crystal lattice assembly. On the protein level, in vitro binding studies of serum proteins to basic calcium phosphates helped to identify structurally diverse but generally acidic mineral-binding proteins like α2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein/fetuin-A, γ-carboxyglutamate proteins, albumin, fibronectin, or transferrin (2Blumenthal N.C.

Biointerphases. 2007; 2: 16-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations of freshly synthesized CPPs revealed nanometer sized spheres. Subsequent CPP transformation was associated with a morphological change to prolate ellipsoids called secondary CPPs (16Heiss A. Jahnen-Dechent W. Endo H. Schwahn D. Biointerphases. 2007; 2: 16-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that fetuin-A on the surface of these mineral colloids (i) reduced diffusion of ions to the mineral core and (ii) prevented particle aggregation (16Heiss A. Jahnen-Dechent W. Endo H. Schwahn D. Biointerphases. 2007; 2: 16-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The role of albumin as an inhibitor of calcification is ambiguous. Albumin modulates crystal seed growth but is a relatively weak inhibitor of calcium phosphate precipitation from supersaturated solutions. Studies on seeded growth of hydroxyapatite using complete human serum and albumin-depleted human serum indicated that albumin accounted for ∼50% of the serum inhibition (3Garnett J. Dieppe P. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 863-868PubMed Google Scholar). The overall activity was, however, attributed to the high albumin serum concentration (∼40 mg/ml) rather than to a highly specific inhibitor activity (3Garnett J. Dieppe P. Biochem.

Here we present a biochemical analysis of CPP-like particles from ascites fluid of a peritoneal dialysis patient. The sample contained albumin as the most abundant protein, whereas the fetuin-A content was low, prompting us to systematically study the effect of serum protein mixtures on the inhibition of calcium phosphate precipitation. Based on the results of these studies, we propose a refined model of systemic calcification inhibition implying cooperative effects of acidic serum proteins and fetuin-A as a key player.MATERIALS AND METHODSTransmission Electron Microscopy—Sample volumes of 50 μl were dialyzed against distilled water at room temperature for 20 min (Mini Slide-A-Lyzer, Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany), and then 10 μl were applied onto Formvar (polyvinyl formal)-coated copper grids (Plano, Wetzlar, Germany). After 5 min of incubation, excess liquid was soaked away, and the grids were dried at room temperature. The mineral particles were visualized without staining using a JEOL JEM 2000 FX II, operated at 200 kV (10Heiss A. DuChesne A. Denecke B. Grötzinger J. Yamamoto K. Renné T. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol.

A column void volume V0 of 7.3 ml was determined using 1-μm-sized polystyrene spheres. Phosphate concentration in the eluate was assessed by the molybdate complex method.To detect CPP-associated fetuin-A, bovine fetuin-A monomer was labeled with N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin following the manufacturer's protocol (Perbio Science). CPPs were synthesized using biotinylated fetuin-A and separated as mentioned above. 5 μl of each eluate fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Biotinylated fetuin-A was detected by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence.Preparation of Proteins—Bovine fetuin-A, bovine albumin, ovalbumin (all Sigma), and lysozyme (Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) were purified by gel permeation chromatography using a Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Fetuin-A and albumin concentrations were determined photometrically at 280 nm applying extinction coefficients ϵ1% = 5.3 (22Spiro R.G. J. Biol.

After 2 h of shaking at 37 °C, the bacteria were harvested and lysed. The target protein was isolated from the supernatant by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) followed by a dialysis against Tris-buffered saline (10Heiss A.

Purified and lyophilized prothrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratory, Swansea, UK) was dissolved in buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl).For protein analysis of the peritoneal dialysate, a 40-μl suspension was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min. The particles were separated from the supernatant, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and dissolved in 40 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. 0.2 μl of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with colloidal Coomassie (Invitrogen), or blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunodetection.Precipitation Inhibition Mix—All stock solutions of NaCl (Roth), Tris buffer (Sigma), CaCl2, and Na2HPO4 (Merck) had analytical quality and were filtered (0.2 μm) before use.

This instrumental setup permitted a parallel assessment of the onsets of CPP transformation and sedimentation covering a time span of 9 h in 5-min intervals.Dynamic Light Scattering—To determine the hydrodynamic radius of CPPs, a three-dimensional cross-correlated dynamic light scattering (DLS) device was used. The three-dimensional DLS allows the assessment of the true hydrodynamic radius despite multiple scattering (turbidity) as described (24Overbeck E. Sinn C. J.

Typically sample volumes of 0.3 ml were applied to cuvettes (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany) and measured with 90° geometry using an LS Instruments apparatus with two avalanche photon detectors (APD, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Type SPCM-AQR-13-FC) and an ALV 5000 correlator. A laser diode module (Koheras A/S, Birkerod, Denmark, λ = 681.3 nm, power = 16 milliwatts, Type LGTC 685-35) formed the light source. Temperature control was achieved by a water bath and a thermostat. The diffusion coefficients and the polydispersity index were obtained from a cumulant analysis (27Koppel D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 57: 4814-4820Crossref Scopus (2709) Google Scholar), and hydrodynamic radii were calculated using the Stokes-Einstein equation.RESULTSCPP-like Complexes in Chronic Kidney Disease Patient Ascites—Late stage chronic kidney disease patients have a deranged mineral homeostasis and require dialysis. The imbalanced homeostasis is generally associated with vascular and valvular calcifications that result in an increased morbidity and mortality. One particular severe form of dialysis-associated calcification is calcifying peritonitis. These patients have a sterile ascites (Fig. 1A) of milky appearance containing colloidal, rice grain-shaped mineral particles (Fig. 1B). Supernatant and pelleted minerals were both analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C) and human fetuin-A immunoblotting (Fig. 1D), respectively. The supernatant in Fig. 1C, lane 1, had a protein composition similar to serum. Lane 2 in Fig. 1, C and D, shows the protein analysis of the mineral colloid (i.e. the proteins attached to the particles). A side by side comparison of the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel and a matching immunoblot suggested that a substantial amount of albumin and a comparably small amount of fetuin-A were contained in the mineral phase (Fig. 1, C and D). The CPP-like particles isolated from ascites of the calcifying peritonitis patient (Fig. 1B) showed, despite the low fetuin-A and high albumin concentration, a remarkable similarity to second state CPPs synthesized in vitro in the presence of abundant fetuin-A but without any supplementary proteins (Fig. 2B). This observation raised the question of whether the high fraction of mineral-bound albumin simply reflected the abundance of this protein in human ascites or whether calcification inhibition in vivo also involves albumin and similar acidic serum proteins. To address this issue we synthesized CPPs in vitro employing pure proteins and protein mixtures and studied the formation, stability, and composition of various CPPs thus formed.FIGURE 2CPP isolation and analysis. A and B, CPP formation mediated by 50 μm fetuin-A. TEM images of CPPs in the first (A) and second state (B), respectively. Initial CPPs are amorphous (10Heiss A. DuChesne A. Denecke B. Grötzinger J.

Biointerphases. 2007; 2: 16-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and electron diffraction (not shown) suggested that mineral crystallization to OCP precedes transformation to the second state. The high resolution image (inset) visualizes the lattice planes. C, in contrast to fetuin-A, albumin as a low affinity mineral binder inhibited mineral formation even at high serum-like concentration for only a few minutes. Similar to fetuin-A, electron diffraction (inset) suggested an initial amorphous mineral phase. Scale bar in all images 100 nm. D, separation of secondary CPPs (second state, 9 h, room temperature) from the free fetuin-A monomer by S500 size exclusion chromatography monitored at λ = 280 nm (solid line) and 400 nm (dashed line). CPPs were eluted directly after the void volume V0, whereas the fetuin-A monomer was eluted at higher volumes. Because detection in the UV range is more susceptible to turbidity, protein detection at 280 nm interferes with the turbidity caused by the CPPs, whereas the 400-nm absorption curve represents the light scattered at the CPPs. mAU, milliabsorbance units. E, peak fractions from D applied onto a SDS gel. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase detection of biotinylated fetuin-A revealed that only a minor fraction of total fetuin-A (20 μm) was enclosed in the CPPs. F, phosphate concentration profile. A semiquantitative analysis indicated that about 70% of the total phosphate was enclosed in the CPPs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Synthesis and Structure of Calciprotein Particles—First we synthesized pure and stable fetuin-A containing CPPs. Fetuin-A buffers mineral ion supersaturation by stabilizing precursors of mineralization as colloids. These colloidal particles are initially amorphous with respect to the mineral phase (Fig. 2A), and the CPPs underwent a transformation process (10Heiss A. DuChesne A. Denecke B. Grötzinger J.

Biointerphases. 2007; 2: 16-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second-stage CPPs are long-term stable and consist of lamellar aggregates of crystalline needles or platelets (Fig. 2B). In contrast, albumin stabilized nascent mineral nuclei in solution even at high concentrations (here 606 μm) only for a short period of time (Fig. 2C) and never displayed a similar ripening process, confirming the relatively weak inhibitory potential of albumin discovered in earlier studies (5Schinke T.

Inorg. Biochem. 1994; 55: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).We employed gel permeation chromatography to study the formation of CPPs from unlabeled or labeled fetuin-A dissolved in calcium and phosphate-containing buffer. Primary CPPs tended to dissolve, but secondary particles were stable and could be readily analyzed by gel permeation chromatography. A typical elution profile monitored at 280 nm (Fig. 2D, solid line) showed a sharp peak, indicating that the high molecular weight CPPs eluted directly after the void volume. A second broader peak co-eluted with the fetuin-A monomer. The peak integrals did not reflect the true protein amounts, because light absorption and light scattering at the particles both contributed to the signal intensity. At 400 nm, only light scattering of the CPPs was measured, enabling the time-resolved study of CPP formation and stability (Fig. 2D, dashed line). Next, biotinylated fetuin-A was used to synthesize CPPs. The mixture was separated by gel permeation chromatography, and fetuin-A content in the eluate was quantified by streptavidin immunoblotting. We determined that a relatively small amount of fetuin-A eluted at the CPP position (<10% by densitometry), and most of the fetuin-A eluted at the monomer position (Fig. 2E). Thus, a relatively small amount of fetuin-A is sufficient to mediate long-term stable second-stage CPPs even at high supersaturations.Measuring phosphate in the eluted fractions (Fig. 2F) indicated that the high molecular weight peak, i.e. the CPPs, contained about two-thirds of the phosphate originally present in the precipitation mixture, confirming earlier results obtained with small angle neutron scattering (16Heiss A. Jahnen-Dechent W. Endo H. Schwahn D. Biointerphases. 2007; 2: 16-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrafiltration of the precipitation mixtures employing a 300-kDa cut-off membrane to separate the CPPs (retentate) from the fetuin-A monomer and non-CPP ions (filtrate) confirmed this value. We found that the retained CPP fraction contained 71 ± 5% of the total phosphate.Inhibition of Calcification by Acidic Plasma Proteins—Our routine assay to assess the inhibitory potential of serum or individual serum proteins was based on the quantification of mineral sedimentation at 10,000 × g (Fig. 3A) (5Schinke T.

It allowed the identification of fetuin-A as a potent stabilizer of CPPs. However, it lacked time-resolved data and, therefore, was unsuitable for the investigation of CPP formation and stability. Moreover, this assay produced spurious results at low fetuin-A concentrations close to the CPP stability threshold. For example, the IC50 of 7.4 μm fetuin-A derived from the assay did not correspond to the observed macroscopic sample stability (Fig. 3A) in that a precipitate could be collected by centrifugation, but the same solution was long-term stable (yet cloudy) at ambient gravity.FIGURE 3Concerted mineral sedimentation inhibition by the two serum proteins fetuin-A and albumin. A, an IC50 of 7.4 μm was assessed for fetuin-A using the precipitate quantification based inhibition assay (see “Materials and Methods”). B, corresponding time-resolved turbidimetry measurements indicated that the inhibition mixes were stable down to a concentration of 7 μm fetuin-A. Moreover, the onset of CPP transformation, i.e. the stability of primary CPPs, correlated with the fetuin-A concentration. C, investigation of the inhibition of fetuin-A, albumin, and mixtures thereof at various concentrations by turbidimetry. The measurements revealed that supplementary albumin, itself a weak inhibitor, significantly enhances the mediated fetuin-A inhibition. n ≥ 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We employed two light scattering based methods, turbidimetry and dynamic light scattering, to study the formation and stability of CPPs in real time.

https://openalex.org/W2025291080,"Following the screening of a battery of distinct small-interfering RNAs that target various components of the apoptotic machinery, we found that knockdown of the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) was particularly efficient in preventing cell death induced by cisplatin (CDDP) in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Both the downregulation of VDAC1 and its chemical inhibition with 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid reduced the apoptosis-associated modifications induced by CDDP, including mitochondrial transmembrane potential dissipation and plasma membrane permeabilization. VDAC1 inhibition strongly reduced the CDDP-induced conformational activation of Bax, yet had no discernible effect on the activation of Bak, suggesting that VDAC1 acts downstream of Bak and upstream of Bax. Accordingly, knockdown of Bak abolished the activation of Bax, whereas Bax downregulation had no effect on Bak activation. In VDAC1-depleted cells, the failure of CDDP to activate Bax could be reversed by means of the Bcl-2/Bcl-XL antagonist ABT-737, which concomitantly restored CDDP cytotoxicity. Altogether, these results delineate a novel pathway for the induction of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) in the course of CDDP-induced cell death that involves a hierarchical contribution of Bak, VDAC1 and Bax. Moreover, our data suggest that VDAC1 may act as a facultative regulator/effector of MMP, depending on the initial cytotoxic event."
https://openalex.org/W2001635537,"We report here that blocking the activity of the 26 S proteasome results in drastic changes in the morphology of the mitochondria and accumulation of intermembrane space (IMS) proteins. Using endonuclease G (endoG) as a model IMS protein, we found that accumulation of wild-type but to a greater extent mutant endoG leads to changes in the morphology of the mitochondria similar to those observed following proteasomal inhibition. Further, we show that wild-type but to a greater extent mutant endoG is a substrate for ubiquitination, suggesting the presence of a protein quality control. Conversely, we also report that wild-type but not mutant endoG is a substrate for the mitochondrial protease Omi but only upon inhibition of the proteasome. These findings suggest that although elimination of mutant IMS proteins is strictly dependent on ubiquitination, elimination of excess or spontaneously misfolded wild-type IMS proteins is monitored by ubiquitination and as a second checkpoint by Omi cleavage when the proteasome function is deficient. One implication of our finding is that in the context of attenuated proteasomal function, accumulation of IMS proteins would contribute to the collapse of the mitochondrial network such as that observed in neurodegenerative diseases. Another implication is that such collapse could be accelerated either by mutations in IMS proteins or by mutations in Omi itself."

https://openalex.org/W2119213958,"Lactoferrin (LF) is an important protein component of the innate immune system that is broadly distributed within the body fluids. LF is endowed with multiple biological activities. Talactoferrin (TLF), a recombinant human LF, is in clinical development as an anticancer agent and is entering Phase III clinical trials. Here, we show that TLF induces the maturation of human dendritic cells (DCs) derived from monocytes. TLF, at physiologically relevant concentrations (100 microg/ml) up-regulates the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II, CD83, CD80, and CD86 costimulatory molecule and CXCR4 and CCR7 chemokine receptors, acting primarily through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. DCs matured by TLF displayed an enhanced release of IL-8 and CXCL10, as well as a significantly reduced production of IL-6, IL-10, and CCL20. They also display a reduced ability to take up antigen and increased capacity to trigger proliferation and release IFN-gamma in the presence of allogeneic human T cells. TLF-matured DCs are able to prime naive T cells to respond to KLH antigen and display a significantly increased capacity to present Flu-MA(58-66) peptide to HLA-A2-matched T cells. These data suggest that a key immunomodulatory function that may be mediated by TLF is to link the innate with adaptive immunity through DC maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2083701188,"HspA, a member of the GroES chaperonin family, is a small protein found in Helicobacter pylori with a unique histidine- and cysteine-rich domain at the C terminus. In this work, we overexpressed, purified, and characterized this protein both in vitro and in vivo. The apo form of the protein binds 2.10 +/- 0.07 Ni(2+) or 1.98 +/- 0.08 Bi(3+) ions/monomer with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 1.1 or 5.9 x 10(-19) microm, respectively. Importantly, Ni(2+) can reversibly bind to the protein, as the bound nickel can be released either in the presence of a chelating ligand, e.g. EDTA, or at an acidic pH (pH((1/2)) 3.8 +/- 0.2). In contrast, Bi(3+) binds almost irreversibly to the protein. Both gel filtration chromatography and native electrophoresis demonstrated that apo-HspA exists as a heptamer in solution. Unexpectedly, binding of Bi(3+) to the protein altered its quaternary structure from a heptamer to a dimer, indicating that bismuth may interfere with the biological functions of HspA. When cultured in Ni(2+)-supplemented M9 minimal medium, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing wild-type HspA or the C-terminal deletion mutant clearly indicated that the C terminus might protect cells from high concentrations of external Ni(2+). However, an opposite phenomenon was observed when the same E. coli hosts were grown in Bi(3+)-supplemented medium. HspA may therefore play a dual role: to facilitate nickel acquisition by donating Ni(2+) to appropriate proteins in a nickel-deficient environment and to carry out detoxification via sequestration of excess nickel. Meanwhile, HspA can be a potential target of the bismuth antiulcer drug against H. pylori."

MR molecular imaging of control rabbits (no fumagillin) revealed a predominant peripheral distribution of neovascularity representing 7.2% of the tumor rim volume, which decreased to 2.8% (P<0.05) with alpha(nu)beta(3)-targeted fumagillin nanoparticle treatment. Microscopically, the tumor parenchyma tended to show T-cell infiltration after targeted fumagillin treatment, which was not appreciated in control animals.

A substantial amount of data correlate SORLA activity with APP processing and Aβ production rates in cell cultures. Still, the normal physiological role of SORLA-dependent regulation of APP processing in vivo and the pathophysiological consequences of insufficient receptor activity in the brain remain poorly understood. Here, we used alternative mouse models with targeted Sorla gene disruption to address the molecular and pathophysiological consequences of impaired SORLA activity for neuronal function and AD pathology in vivo. Our findings identified a distinct increase in Aβ production and amyloid plaque formation in transgenic mouse models of AD lacking receptor expression. In addition, we uncovered stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways and enhanced neurogenesis, possibly caused by high levels of soluble APP fragments found in the SORLA-deficient brain.

The relative units represent LAU (local area units) per millimeter2 minus background. Human Aβ40 was quantified using a commercial ELISA kit (KHB3482, BIOSOURCE). Unless stated otherwise, the statistical significance of data was determined using the Student's t test. Determination of Plaque Load—Three to six hippocampal sections from each (PDAPP, Sorla+/-) (10 mo, n = 13) and (PDAPP, Sorla−/-) (10 mo, n = 9) mouse were randomly chosen and stained with antibodies directed against Aβ (MX-02, 4G8; 1:500 dilution). The quantification of relative density of immunoreactivity was performed using the software program Cell F (Olympus) in single optical images and all data related to the mean value of the (PDAPP, Sorla+/-) controls in the respective data set. To do so, ×4-magnification images of the sections were taken. After defining a constant color threshold, hippocampus, and subiculum on the sections were manually delineated as region of interest, images were binarized, and relative staining intensity of the surface area in the defined region of interest calculated. Levels of statistical significance were calculated by the Mann-Whitney U test. All data are given as means ± S.E. Animal Experimentation—The generation of SORLA-deficient mice by targeted gene disruption has been described before (3Andersen O.M. Reiche J. Schmidt V. Gotthardt M. Spoelgen R.

A second receptor null line on a (129/Ola × C57BL/6N) background was generated independently through insertional mutagenesis of the murine Sorla gene locus by a lacZ reporter gene (12Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Avery B.J. Tate P. Dill K. Pangilinan E. Wakenight P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Skarnes W.C. Nat.

All studies involving animals were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. For electrophysiology, horizontal hippocampal brain slices (300-μm thick) were prepared according to standard procedures and field potential recordings performed with low resistance patch-clamp electrodes (13Plath N.

Field EPSPs were recorded in stratum radiatum in area CA1. Schaffer collaterals were stimulated with a frequency of 0.1-0.05 Hz. Stimulation strength was adjusted to 30-50% of the strength needed to evoke population spikes. LTP was induced by four tetani of high frequency stimulation at 100 Hz for 1 s with 20 s intertrain intervals. The magnitude of LTP was determined by averaging the responses collected during the last 5 min of each experiment. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Immunohistology—Brains were fixed in situ in 4% formalin by transcardiac perfusion, post-fixed at 4 °C for 24 h, and stored in 30% sucrose until further processing. For each animal, one hemibrain was cut into 40-μm thick free-floating sagittal sections, while the second hemibrain was embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-μm sections. The staining of paraffin sections with thionine (Nissl staining) or immunohistological detection of acetylcholine transferase (1:200; Chemicon, Schwalbach, Germany), macrophage/microglial marker F4/80 (1:100; Serotec, Düsseldorf, Germany), astrocytic marker GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) (1:1000 Advanced Immunochemical Inc., Long Beach, CA) on free-floating sections was performed according to standard protocols using biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and the ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) for visualization. For fluorescence microscopy (GFAP), sections were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 (1:250; Molecular Probes, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 4 h, mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and viewed with a laser scanning confocal microscope. DNA fragmentation in apoptotic nuclei was detected by labeling with the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Sciences GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For immuno-electronmicroscopy detection of APP, dissected hippocampi of one wild-type and one knockout mouse were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, embedded in 10% gelatin, and infiltrated with 2.3 m sucrose. Frozen samples were trimmed to the region of the neuronal cell layers, and ultrathin cryosections were obtained according to Tokuyasu. APP was detected by polyclonal anti-APP antibody 1227 (diluted 1:250). For signal detection, 12 nm colloidal gold-AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG, EM grade (Jackson Immuno Research Lab., Inc.) was used. Labeled Golgi fields were examined on a Zeiss 910 electron microscope equipped with an 1k × 1k CCD camera (Proscan) and analyzed with the analySIS 3.2 software (Soft Imaging System, Münster, Germany) for counting grains of gold and Golgi area determination. Quantification of Neurogenesis—The proliferation and survival of newborn neurons were determined by BrdUrd incorporation analysis following a 24 h or 4-week chase period, respectively. Animals received a single (proliferation) or 3-day repeated (survival) intraperitoneal dose of 50 μg of BrdUrd (Sigma)/g body weight at 10 mg/ml in 0.9% NaCl. Brains were fixed in 4% PFA, infiltrated in 30% sucrose, and sectioned at 40 μm. The number of BrdUrd-labeled cells was determined by immunohistology using rat anti-BrdUrd (1:500; Harlan Seralab, Indianapolis, IN), followed by biotinylated donkey anti-rat (1:500; Dianova) and the peroxidase detection system (ABC Elite kit) with nickel-intensified diaminobenzidine as chromogen. The sections were counted in a one-in-six series through a ×40 objective, and multiplied by 6 to give an estimate for the total number of BrdUrd-positive cells per entire dentate gyrus. Previously, we had reported the generation of a mouse model with targeted Sorla gene disruption. Loss of receptor activity was shown to increase the overall production of sAPP and Aβ, in line with an inverse correlation of receptor activity and APP processing rates in cultured cells (3Andersen O.M. Reiche J. Schmidt V. Gotthardt M. Spoelgen R. Behlke J. von Arnim C.A. Breiderhoff T. Jansen P. Wu X. Bales K.R. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Gliemann J. Mufson E.J. Hyman B.T. Paul S.M. Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13461-13466Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying accelerated APP processing in this mouse model, as well as its effect on neuronal activity and survival remained an open issue. Here, we have investigated in detail the consequences of the loss of SORLA activity in vivo, particularly focusing on the hippocampus, a region in the brain that is especially vulnerable to AD-related disease processes. When APP was detected in hippocampal extracts from Sorla−/- mice using Western blot analysis, immunoreactive bands corresponding to the full-length forms of APP were specifically reduced compared with control animals (Fig. 1A, middle panel). The loss of APP protein was more pronounced for the fully glycosylated mature than the immature polypeptide variant. Thus, this decrease in mature APP mass in SORLA knockout mice may have been missed in previous studies where the bands corresponding to mature and immature APPs, respectively, were not resolved by SDS-PAGE (3Andersen O.M. Reiche J. Schmidt V. Gotthardt M. Spoelgen R. Behlke J. von Arnim C.A. Breiderhoff T. Jansen P. Wu X. Bales K.R. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Gliemann J. Mufson E.J. Hyman B.T. Paul S.M. Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13461-13466Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The reduction in APP was likely caused by accelerated proteolytic processing as indicated by a concomitant increase in soluble (s) APP products in receptor-deficient tissue (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Similar findings were obtained in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons where expression of SORLA can be seen in the perinuclear region in cells from wild type but not from SORLA-deficient newborn mice (Fig. 1B). Again, loss of receptor activity in knockout cells resulted in a distinct decrease in full-length APP and a massive increase in soluble APP-processing products (Fig. 1C). Using densitometric scanning of Western blots exemplified in Fig. 1C, the amount of mature APP was calculated to be reduced by ∼70% (data not shown) whereas sAPP was increased by more than 50% (Fig. 1D) as compared with wild-type neurons. Accelerated conversion of APP into its processing products was also confirmed in an independent mouse model of SORLA deficiency generated by insertion of a β-galactosidase reporter gene into the murine Sorla gene coding region (Fig. 2) (sorEX255, kindly provided by W. C. Skarnes). No changes in App gene transcription rates were detected by gene expression profiling comparing Sorla+/+- and Sorla−/--deficient brain tissues (data not shown). Alterations in APP processing in Sorla−/- animals did neither affect the overall anatomy of the hippocampus (Fig. 1F), a site of high receptor expression (Fig. 1E); nor other regions of the CNS (data not shown).FIGURE 2SORLA deficiency enhances APP processing in the sorEX255 line of mice. A, Western blot analysis of total brain extracts (left panel) from wild type (+/+) and SORLA-deficient mice (-/-) of the sorEX255 line of mice indicates the absence of SORLA expression in knockouts (panel SORLA), accompanied by a reduction in full-length APP (bracket, panel APP, IgG 1227), and an increase in soluble (s) APP levels (panel sAPP, IgG 22C11). As a loading control, the membranes were reprobed with an antibody directed against neuron-specific β-tubulin. The asterisk in panel APP indicates chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan-modified APP molecules that are also reduced in Sorla−/- animals. A similar increase in sAPP levels was seen in extracts of primary hippocampal neurons from sorEX255 mice compared with control animals (right panel, IgG 22C11). B, quantification of mature (m) APP levels in primary hippocampal lysates of wild type and SORLA-deficient sorEX255 mice (set at 100%) determined by densitometric scanning of Western blots as exemplified in A (n = 4 independent experiments, IgG 1227).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To also explore the consequence of insufficient SORLA activity for amyloidogenic processes and senile plaque formation, we introduced the Sorla gene defect into the PDAPP line of mice that carries the human AppV717F transgene. This line represents a well-established mouse model of AD pathology (14Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R. Berthelette P. Blackwell C. Carr T. Clemens J. Donaldson T. Gillespie F. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (2247) Google Scholar). In hippocampal neurons from newborn mice doubly transgenic for human AppV717F and the Sorla null allele, levels of full-length human APP were reduced (Fig. 3A) but concentrations of human sAPPα (Fig. 3, A and B), sAPPβ (Fig. 3, A and C), and Aβ40 (Fig. 3D) were significantly increased compared with PDAPP mice expressing SORLA. These findings provide in vivo confirmation of previous reports that demonstrated an inhibitory effect of SORLA activity on both α- and β-secretase activities in CHO cells (15Schmidt V. Sporbert A. Rohe M. Reimer T. Rehm A. Andersen O.M. Willnow T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32956-32964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar); an inhibitory activity lost in SORLA-deficient neurons. Consistent with a proposed role for SORLA in retention of APP in the Golgi, the total amount of precursor molecules specifically in this organelle was reduced in neurons from (PDAPP, Sorla−/-) mice compared with (PDAPP, Sorla+/-) littermates as shown by immuno-electronmicroscopy (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Reduced number of APP molecules in the Golgi of Sorla-deficient neurons.

Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The extent of human Aβ production in the PDAPP line was significantly accelerated when the Sorla gene defect was introduced into this model (Fig. 5A), resulting in a 3-fold increased plaque burden (Fig. 5B). Enhanced plaque deposition was seen in all brain areas but was particularly prominent in the hippocampus (Fig. 5C). Similar findings of increased plaque deposition were also obtained when the sorEX255 model of receptor deficiency was introduced into the PDAPP line (supplemental Fig. S1). Taken together, these data substantiated a role for SORLA in protection of APP from secretase processing in vivo, and the significance of low receptor activity as a cause of enhanced precursor breakdown and senile plaque formation. Similar to other murine models of AD, aggravated plaque load did not significantly affect overall neuroanatomy in (PDAPP, Sorla−/-) mice as determined by immunohistology for markers of cholinergic neurons, activated microglia, and astroglia (supplemental Fig. S2), or apoptotic nuclei (data not shown). To test whether increased Aβ levels in SORLA-deficient animals may impair neuronal activity we determined basis synaptic transmission and LTP in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. In agreement with previous reports (17Hsia A.Y. Masliah E. McConlogue L. Yu G.Q. Tatsuno G. Hu K. Kholodenko D. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Mucke L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1999; 96: 3228-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), the presence of the AppV717F transgene per se resulted in impairment in synaptic transmission as indicated by a decrease in the slope of input-output curves when comparing Sorla+/- (Fig. 6A, open circles) with PDAPP, Sorla+/- (open squares, p < 0.05) animals. In contrast, LTP was not altered by human APP expression (comparing data for Sorla+/- animals in Fig. 6B with PDAPP, Sorla+/- mice in Fig. 6C). This situation was not altered by the presence or absence of SORLA; neither on the murine APP (Fig. 6B, comparing Sorla+/- and Sorla−/- animals) nor on the human PDAPP background (Fig. 6C, comparing PDAPP, Sorla+/- and PDAPP, Sorla−/- animals). While formation of neurotoxic Aβ oligomers and senile plaques as causes of neuronal dysfunction and ultimate cell death in AD patients is firmly established, it remains debatable how soluble APP products influence normal neuronal function and how they may affect AD disease processes. In particular, sAPP was shown to act as a physiological signaling factor in MAP kinase pathways that are likely to be changed in the context of altered APP-processing fates (18Greenberg S.M. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. Qiu W.Q. Kosik K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7104-7108Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Using Western blot analysis, we, therefore, investigated the consequences of increased sAPP levels in primary hippocampal neurons from wild type and SORLA-deficient newborn mice. We focused on the activity of ERK, a MAP kinase proposed to act downstream of sAPP in signaling processes in neurons (19Wallace W.C. Akar C.A. Lyons W.E. Kole H.K. Egan J.M. Wolozin B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 213-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a significant increase in the phosphorylated fraction of ERK was detected in Sorla−/- neurons compared with controls, while the absolute levels of the kinase were unchanged (Fig. 7, A and B). To control for the specificity of this effect, we also evaluated levels of total and phosphorylated forms of AKT (protein kinase B), a kinase activated downstream of sAPPα in neurons (20Cheng G. Yu Z. Zhou D. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 175: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and epithelial cells (21Wehner S. Siemes C. Kirfel G. Herzog V. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). No changes in phospho-AKT levels were detected for this alternative sAPP signaling pathway (Fig. 7A). Selective modulation of ERK signaling in Sorla−/- neurons was confirmed by global profiling of major neuronal signaling pathways in hippocampal extracts using the Kinetworks™ PhosphoSite neurobiology Screen (KPSS-9.0, Kinexus). This test identified a 44% increase in ERK1 and a 102% increase in ERK2 phosphorylation in SORLA-deficient hippocampi compared with wild-type controls (data not shown). Activity levels of other kinases, such as glycogen synthase-serine kinase 3α, stress-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, as well as protein kinase C isoforms λ, ϵ, and γ were not altered in this screen (not shown). ERK-dependent signaling pathways have been implicated in the stimulation of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus (22Persson A.I. Thorlin T. Bull C. Eriksson P.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 360-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Rueda D. Navarro B. Martinez-Serrano A. Guzman M. Galve-Roperh I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46645-46650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To investigate the consequences of elevated sAPP levels and enhanced ERK signaling in the SORLA-deficient brain, we determined hippocampal precursor cell proliferation and survival in mice at 24 h and 4 weeks after BrdUrd injection, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3). Consistent with enhanced ERK activity in this mouse model, we detected a ∼3-fold increase in the number of proliferating cells (Fig. 8A) and a ∼2-fold increase in the number of surviving, BrdUrd-positive cells (Fig. 8C) in the dentate gyrus of Sorla−/- compared with control littermates at 5 months of age. Increased survival of newborn cells was even seen at 14 months of age, although the overall extent of neurogenesis was age-related reduced in both genotypes (Fig. 8C). Using double immunofluorescence microscopy for BrdUrd and neuronal markers doublecortin (DCX) and neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN), we confirmed that ∼50% of all proliferating cells detected after 24 h were newborn immature neurons (positive for DCX) (Fig. 8B) and more than 90% of surviving cells after 4 weeks were post-mitotic mature neurons (positive for NeuN) (Fig. 8D). No discernable difference in the percent distribution between neuronal and non-neuronal (GFAP-positive) cell populations was seen between the Sorla genotypes (data not shown). Enhanced neurogenesis in Sorla−/- animals was exclusive and not accompanied by increased neuronal cell death as tested by TUNEL on hippocampal sections (Fig. 9A) or Western blot for activated caspase 3 in primary hippocampal neurons (Fig. 9B).FIGURE 9Analysis of cell death in wild type and SORLA-deficient mice.

A Gram-positive, filamentous bacterium Streptomyces griseus contained an srs operon, in which srsA encoded a type III PKS, srsB encoded a methyltransferase, and srsC encoded a flavoprotein hydroxylase. Consistent with this annotation, overexpression of the srs genes in a heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans, showed that SrsA was a type III PKS responsible for synthesis of phenolic lipids, alkylresorcinols, and alkylpyrones, SrsB was a methyltransferase acting on the phenolic lipids to yield alkylresorcinol methyl ethers, and SrsC was a hydroxylase acting on the alkylresorcinol methyl ethers. In vitro SrsA reaction showed that SrsA synthesized alkylresorcinols from acyl-CoAs of various chain lengths as a starter substrate, one molecule of methylmalonyl-CoA, and two molecules of malonyl-CoA. SrsA was thus unique in that it incorporated the extender substrates in a strictly controlled order of malonyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and methylmalonyl-CoA to produce alkylresorcinols. An srsA mutant, which produced no phenolic lipids, was highly sensitive to β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin G and cephalexin. Together with the fact that the alkylresorcinols were fractionated mainly in the cell wall fraction, this observation suggests that the phenolic lipids, perhaps associated with the cytoplasmic membrane because of their amphiphilic property, affect the characteristic and rigidity of the cytoplasmic membrane/peptidoglycan of a variety of bacteria.

Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). We previously found that a type III PKS, RppA, in the Gram-positive, filamentous bacterium Streptomyces griseus catalyzes the synthesis of 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene by using malonyl-CoA as a starter, carrying out four successive extensions with malonyl-CoA and cyclizing the resulting pentaketide to the naphthalene scaffold (2Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Fujii I. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Nature. 1999; 400: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This was the first report of a functional type III PKS from bacteria. Since then, genome projects of bacteria have predicted that type III PKSs are distributed widely not only in Streptomyces but also other various bacteria. For example, ArsB and ArsC, both of which are type III PKSs in Azotobacter vinelandii, catalyze the synthesis of alkylresorcinols and alkylpyrones, respectively, which are essential for encystment as the major lipids in the cyst membrane (3Funa N. Ozawa H. Hirata A. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6356-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).We have recently completed the genome project for S. griseus 3Ohnishi, Y., Ishikawa, J., Hara, H., Suzuki, H., Ikenoya, M., Ikeda, H., Yamashita, A., Hattori, M., and Horinouchi, S. (2008) J. Bacteriol., in press. 3Ohnishi, Y., Ishikawa, J., Hara, H., Suzuki, H., Ikenoya, M., Ikeda, H., Yamashita, A., Hattori, M., and Horinouchi, S. (2008) J. Bacteriol., in press. and found another gene encoding a type III PKS, in addition to RppA. This type III PKS was named SrsA (Streptomyces resorcinol synthesis) because of its ability to synthesize alkylresorcinols in a unique manner (see below). SrsA, showing 31% amino acid sequence identity to RppA, appeared to be a member of the proteins whose synthesis was directed by an srs operon consisting of three genes, srsA, srsB, and srsC (see Fig. 1). In this paper, we report the function of the srs operon by elucidating the in vivo and in vitro enzymatic properties of the Srs products. SrsA was responsible for synthesis of the amphiphilic skeletons of phenolic lipids, alkylresorcinols and alkylpyrones, from acyl-CoAs of various chain lengths, as determined by in vitro experiments. Consistent with this idea, overexpression of srsA in a heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans, led to the accumulation of phenolic lipids. In contrast with ArsB and ArsC in A. vinelandii, SrsA used both methylmalonyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA as extender substrates, and the rank order of assembly of the extender substrates was strictly controlled. When srsA and srsB were co-expressed in S. lividans, alkylresorcinol methyl ethers were produced, whereas co-expression of srsA, srsB, and srsC led to production of hydroxylated alkylresorcinols. These observations showed that SrsB was a methyl transferase acting on alkylresorcinols, and SrsC was a hydroxylase acting on alkylresorcinol methyl ethers.In addition to the function of the srsABC operon, we observed a possible role for the metabolites, alkylresorcinols and alkylpyrones. An S. griseus mutant deficient in the phenolic lipids synthesis was highly sensitive to penicillin G and cephalexin, inhibitors of cell wall synthesis, which suggests that the phenolic lipids, presumably integrated and orientated in the cytoplasmic membrane, confer rigidity of the membrane, thus permitting S. griseus to grow in the presence of a higher concentration of the β-lactam antibiotics. Together with the fact that a pair of genes encoding SrsA- and SrsB-like proteins is distributed widely in both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, we speculate that the phenolic lipids play a significant, but so far unrecognized, role in the biological membranes. An attractive example is the phenolic lipids that are essential for cyst formation in A. vinelandii (3Funa N. Ozawa H. Hirata A. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar) and YMPD medium (0.2% yeast extract (Difco), 0.2% meat extract (Kyokuto), 0.4% Bacto peptone (Difco), 0.5% NaCl, 0.2% MgSO4·7H2O, 1% glucose, pH 7.2), respectively. Nucleotide sequences were determined with the Amersham Biosciences Thermo Sequenase fluorescence-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit on an automated DNA sequencer. All PCRs were conducted by using the chromosomal DNA of S. griseus IFO13350 as the template if the template is not indicated. The absence of undesired alterations during PCR was checked by nucleotide sequencing.Construction of pIJ6021-srsA (pFM1)—For construction of pFM1 containing srsA under the control of the tipA promoter in pIJ6021 (see Fig. 1), an NdeI site was introduced at the start codon of srsA by PCR with primer I: 5′-GCGGAATTCCATATGACCCGCATCGCCGCGGT-3′ (with an EcoRI site shown by underlining and the nucleotides to be changed shown by the italic letters) and primer II: 5′-GCGAAGCTTGGATCCGAGGTCATGGGTCTCTCCTTC-3′ (with a HindIII site shown by underlining, a BamHI site shown by the italic letters, and the start codon of srsB shown by the boldface letters). The 1.1-kb amplified fragment was cloned between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC19-srsA. The NdeI-BamHI fragment excised from pUC19-srsA was cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pIJ6021, resulting in pFM1.Construction of pIJ6021-srsAB (pFM2)—For construction of pFM2 containing srsA and srsB (see Fig. 1), the 1.6-kb fragment was amplified by PCR with primer I and primer III (5′-GCGAAGCTTCTCGAGGCCGACGACCAGGACGTCGA-3′; with a HindIII site shown by the italic letters). The amplified fragment was cloned between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC19-srsAB. The NdeI-HindIII fragment excised from pUC19-srsAB was cloned between the NdeI and HindIII sites of pIJ6021, resulting in pFM2.Construction of pIJ6021-srsABC (pFM3)—For construction of pFM3 containing srsA, srsB, and srsC (see Fig. 1), the srsC sequence was attached to the srsAB sequence in pFM2. The 1.1-kb srsC sequence from a BamHI site located 50 bp upstream from the stop codon of srsB to the nucleotide 68 bp downstream from the stop codon of srsC was amplified by PCR with primer IV (5′-GCGGGATCCGCTGCGAGGACGG-3′; with a BamHI site shown by the italic letters) and primer V (5′-GCGAAGCTTCGACCGACGTTATGCCGGAACC-3′; with a HindIII site shown by the italic letters). The BamHI-HindIII fragment was cloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC19-srsC. The 1.1-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment excised from pUC19-srsC was cloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites of pUC19-srsAB, resulting in pUC19-srsABC. The 2.7-kb NdeI-HindIII fragment excised from pUC19-srsABC was cloned between the NdeI and HindIII sites of pIJ6021, resulting in pFM3.Construction of pKUM10-srsA—A 0.8-kb DNA fragment from the nucleotide 480 bp upstream of the srsA start codon to a SalI site located 380 bp downstream of the srsA start codon was amplified by PCR with primer VI (5′-GCGAAGCTTGACCCCGCAGGCCAGCGAGAGC-3′; with a HindIII site shown by the italic letters) and primer VII (5′-GCGGTCGACGGAGGGGGCGGCGATG-3′; with a SalI site shown by the italic letters). The HindIII-SalI fragment was cloned between the HindIII and SalI sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC19-srsAN. The SalI-BamHI fragment excised from pUC19-srsAB was cloned between the SalI and BamHI sites of pUC19-srsAN, resulting in pUC19-srsABN. The EcoRI-BamHI fragment excised from pUC19-srsABN was cloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pKUM10, resulting in pKUM10-srsA.Construction of pSH19-srsA—For adding a histidine tag to the C terminus of SrsA, srsA was cloned in pET26b by introducing an NdeI and BamHI sites in the nucleotide sequences covering the start and stop codons, respectively, by PCR. PCR was performed with primer I and primer VIII (5′-GCGAAGCTTGGATCCCAGCGCAGCAGCACCAGTTCG-3′; with a HindIII and BamHI sites shown by underlining and the italic letters, respectively). The amplified fragment was cloned between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC19-srsA26. The NdeI-BamHI fragment excised from pUC19-srsA26 was cloned between the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET26b, resulting in pET26b-srsA. The nucleotide sequence of srsA together with the histidine tag sequence in pET26b-srsA was amplified by PCR with primer IX (5′-GCGCTGCAGAGCAACGGAGGTACGGACATGACCCGCATCGCCGCGGT-3′; with a PstI site shown by the italic letters; the sequence in the boldface letters is the nitA recognition sequence, including the Shine-Dalgarno-sequence shown by underlining) (8Herai S. Hashimoto Y. Higashibata H. Maseda H. Ikeda H. Omura S. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14031-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and primer X (5′-GCGGGTACCTTTCGGGCTTTGTTAGCAGCCG-3′; with a KpnI site shown by the italic letters). The amplified fragment was cloned between the PstI and KpnI sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC19-srsAH. The PstI-KpnI fragment was cloned between the PstI and KpnI sites of pSH19, resulting in pSH19-srsA.HPLC Analysis of Phenolic Lipids Produced by Streptomyces—S. lividans TK21 harboring pFM1, pFM2, or pFM3 was inoculated to 100 ml of yeast extract-malt extract liquid medium containing 5 μg/ml of kanamycin and grown at 30 °C. After 24 h, 5 μg/ml of thiostrepton was added to induce the tip promoter, and the culture was continued for further 48 h. A portion of the culture broth was adjusted to pH 1.0 with 6 m HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate. After evaporation to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 10 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide for reversed phase HPLC analysis. The conditions for analytical HPLC were: ODS-80Ts column (4.6 × 150 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo) eluted isocratically with 95% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. UV absorbance was detected at 280 nm.Large Scale Preparation and Characterization of Phenolic Lipids—The culture conditions of S. lividans TK21 harboring pFM1 or pFM2 and S. griseus harboring pFM1 were the same as those for the analytical scale, except that the culture was scaled up to 1 liter × 3. After cultivation, the mycelia obtained by centrifugation were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), the cell debris was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was lyophilized to dryness. The culture broth was adjusted to pH 1.0 with 6 m HCl and then extracted with hexane. The hexane extract was passed through a pad of Celite to remove emulsions. The Celite was washed once with hexane. The organic layers were combined, washed with brine, dried with Na2SO4, and evaporated to dryness. The crude materials from the mycelia and the culture broth were dissolved in a small amount of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) and flash-chromatographed on silica gel using chloroform/ethyl acetate (85:15, v/v) as an eluent. The eluate was evaporated and dissolved in methanol for reversed phase preparative HPLC. Compounds 1-17 were purified by reversed phase preparative HPLC equipped with a Pegasil C4 column (10 × 250 mm; Senshu Scientific, Tokyo) by elution isocratically with 95% CH3CN and 1% acetic acid in water at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The collected fractions were lyophilized to give 1-17 as white solids. From S. lividans TK21 harboring pFM1, 4 mg of 1, 7 mg of a mixture of 2, 3, and 4, 21 mg of 5, and 33 mg of a mixture of 6 and 7 were isolated. From S. lividans TK21 harboring pFM2, 4 mg of 8, 14 mg of 9, and 20 mg of a mixture of 10 and 11 were isolated. From S. lividans TK21 harboring pFM3, 5 mg of a mixture of 9 and 15, 1 mg of a mixture of 10, 11, 16, and 17, 6 mg of 12, and 4 mg of a mixture of 13 and 14 were isolated. The structure of each phenolic lipid was determined by proton and carbon NMR spectroscopy, with the aid of heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation analysis, and LC-APCIMS and LC-APCIMS/MS analysis. The NMR data are summarized in the supplemental text. The MS data are summarized in supplemental Table S1.Production and Purification of SrsA—S. lividans TK21 harboring pSH19-srsA was inoculated to 2 liters of yeast extractmalt extract liquid medium containing 5 μg/ml thiostrepton and grown at 30 °C. After 48 h, ϵ-caprolactam (final concentration, 0.1% w/v) was added to induce the nitA promoter, and the culture was continued for a further 60 h. Mycelium was harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. After sonication, cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The cleared lysate was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin columns (Qiagen), washed five times with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 80 mm imidazole, and eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. The purified SrsA (∼1.0 mg) was dialyzed twice against 2 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purity of the recombinant SrsA was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (supplemental Fig. S1).In Vitro SrsA Reaction—14-Methylpentadecanoyl-CoA and 14-methylhexadecanoyl-CoA were prepared according to the method of Blecher (9Blecher M. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reactions, containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 29 μg of SrsA, 200 μm starter-CoA, and 100 μm extender-CoA(s), were performed in a total volume of 300 μl. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h before being quenched by 60 μl of 6 n HCl and extracted with 300 μl of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was evaporated, and the residue dissolved in 30 μl of methanol for HPLC analysis. The conditions for analytical HPLC were as described above.Gene Disruption of srsA in S. griseus—An in-frame deletion in the chromosomal srsA gene was introduced by replacing the region encoding from Gly-33 to Leu-302 with a SalI recognition sequence of six nucleotides (see Fig. 1). A 1.5-kb region upstream from the Pro-32 codon was amplified by using primer XI (5′-GCGGAATTCCTTGCCGTCGTTGGCGTTGG-3′; with an EcoRI site shown by the italic letters) and primer XII (5′-GCGGTCGACGGGCGGCAGGCAGGTGCGGG-3′; with the Pro-32 codon shown by the boldface letters and a SalI site shown by the italic letters). The amplified fragment was cloned between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC-ΔsrsAN. A 1.5-kb region downstream from the Ala-303 codon was amplified by using primer XIII (5′-GCGGTCGACGCCGACGTCGGCAACCTG-3′; with the Ala-303 codon shown by the boldface letters and a SalI site shown by the italic letters) and primer XIV (5′-GCGGACGTCGCGATGCCCTCCCCGG-3′; with a PstI site shown by the italic letters). The amplified fragment was cloned between the SalI and PstI sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC-ΔsrsAC. The SalI-PstI fragment excised from the pUC19-ΔsrsAC was cloned between the SalI and PstI sites of pUC19-ΔsrsAN, resulting in pUC19-ΔsrsA. The kanamycin resistance gene (aphII) from Tn5 (10Beck E. Ludwig G. Auerswald E.A. Reiss B. Schaller H. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) was inserted in the HindIII site of the pUC19-ΔsrsA, resulting in pUC19-ΔsrsAK. pUC19-ΔsrsAK was denatured with NaOH and introduced by protoplast transformation into S. griseus IFO13350. Transformants containing pUC19-ΔsrsAK in the chromosome as a result of single cross-over were selected among kanamycin (10 μg/ml)-resistant colonies. One of the kanamycin-resistant colonies was grown for a week on YMPD agar without kanamycin. Spores recovered were spread on YMPD agar without kanamycin. From these colonies, one ΔsrsA mutant, in which chromosomal srsA was in-frame deleted, was isolated as a kanamycin-sensitive colony. The correct replacement was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The phenolic lipids were extracted from mutant ΔsrsA that had been grown at 28 °C for 4 days in YMPD medium.Subcellular Distribution of Phenolic Lipids in S. griseus—We fractionated the culture into the extracellular, cell wall, cell membrane, and cytoplasmic fractions, according to the method of Pertiwiningrum et al. (11Pertiwiningrum A. Ino Y. Suzuki T. Iwama T. Kawai K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 98: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The wild-type strain S. griseus IFO13350 and mutant ΔsrsA were grown in 50 ml of liquid YMPD medium at 30 °C for 48 h. The cells were collected from 5 ml of culture by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was collected to prepare the extracellular fraction. The cells were washed with 5 ml of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.4 m sucrose and suspended in 5 ml of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.4 m sucrose and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to prepare spheroplasts. The formation of spheroplasts was checked by light microscopic observation. The spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g. The supernatant was collected to prepare the cell wall fraction. The spheroplasts were washed with 5 ml of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.4 m sucrose, and then 3 ml of water was added to burst the spheroplasts. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was the cytoplasmic fraction, and the precipitate was the membrane fraction. All of the fractions were acidified with 1 m HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 20 μl of methanol for HPLC analysis. The conditions for analytical HPLC were as described above.RESULTSOrganization of the srs Operon and Homology Search of Srs Proteins—The gene organization of the 3-kb srs genes is shown in Fig. 1. The stop codon of srsA is 13 nucleotides upstream from the start codon of srsB, and the TGA stop codon of srsB is overlapped with the GTG start codon of srsC. The organization of the srs genes suggested that these three formed an operon that was transcribed from a promoter upstream of srsA. orf1, encoding a protein weakly homologous to a prenyltransferase UbiA (12Siebert M. Bechthold A. Melzer M. May U. Berger U. Schröder G. Schröder J. Severin K. Heide L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which is located 118 nucleotides upstream of srsA or orf2, encoding a putative transmembrane efflux protein, which is located 217 nucleotides downstream of srsC, that appeared not to be functionally linked to the srs operon. We did not study orf1 or orf2 further because the srs operon was sufficient for production of phenolic lipids in S. lividans (see below).SrsA, consisting of 350 amino acid residues, shared 61% amino acid sequence identity to pks10 that is annotated as a functionally unknown type III PKS and is widely distributed among mycobacteria. SrsA also showed 57% identity to pks11 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (supplemental Fig. S2), a type III PKS that catalyzes α-pyrone synthesis from long chain aliphatic acyl-CoA substrates (13Saxena P. Yadav G. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44780-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The similarity of SrsA to pks11 did not necessarily predict the catalytic property of SrsA, because the properties of pks11 were determined only by in vitro reaction and because type III PKSs are promiscuous with respect to substrate specificity and produce α-pyrones from various starter molecules (1Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar).A BLAST search revealed that SrsB, consisting of 177 amino acid residues, contained an isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase domain of the isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase family members that are unique membrane proteins involved in post-translational modification of oncogenic proteins (14Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Because srsB is conserved in various bacterial species and, in most cases, consists of an operon with a type III PKS gene (supplemental Fig. S3), we assumed that SrsB was concerned with a modification of the polyketides produced by SrsA. Sequence alignment of SrsB with Ste14p (15Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), an isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase family protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, along with a computational search for secondary structure prediction of membrane proteins, predicted that SrsB possessed two transmembrane helices (supplemental Fig. S4).SrsC, consisting of 338 amino acid residues, contained a sequence motif found in flavoprotein hydroxylases (16Enroth C. Neujahr H. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Structure. 1998; 6: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that SrsC could be a FAD-dependent hydroxylase. srsC is conserved among actinomycetes as a member of the operons including srsA and srsB in the same order (supplemental Fig. S3).Analysis of Lipids Produced by S. lividans Overexpressing srs Genes—We constructed three plasmids, pFM1 carrying srsA, pFM2 carrying srsA and srsB, and pFM3 carrying srsA, srsB, and srsC and introduced them into a heterologous host, S. lividans TK21 (Fig. 1). The srs genes were under the strong, thiostrepton-inducible tipA promoter on the high copy number plasmid pIJ6021 for overexpression of the srs genes. We analyzed extracts from culture broths and mycelium by HPLC, on the assumption that phenolic lipids might be produced in large amounts and leaked in the culture broth in detectable amounts. Under the conditions employed, S. lividans harboring only the empty vector produced no detectable phenolic lipids (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the recombinant S. lividans strains harboring the srs genes produced several lipids, giving multiple peaks on HPLC (Fig. 2, B-D).FIGURE 2HPLC chromatograms and the structures of phenolic lipids isolated from recombinant S. lividans TK21 carrying a combination of the srs genes. HPLC chromatograms of the lipid fraction prepared from the culture broth of S. lividans TK21 harboring the empty vector pIJ6021 (A), pFM1 carrying srsA (B), pFM2 carrying srsA and srsB (C), and pFM3 carrying srsA, srsB, and srsC (D) are shown. The iso- and anteiso-isomers (2 + 3, 6 + 7, 10 + 11, 13 + 14, and 16 + 17) could not be separated. The second peak in B contained 4 and mixture X, as revealed with a preparative-scale column. Mixture X was composed of at least 2 and/or 3 and a monounsaturated form(s) of 6 and/or 7. The peak containing compound 8 in (C) also contained very small amounts of mono-unsaturated forms of 10 + 11. The third peak in (D) contained 15 and a very small amount of 9. The fourth peak in D contained compounds 16 + 17 and very small amounts of 10 + 11. The structures of the phenolic lipids 1-19 are shown in E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For structural determination by NMR analysis of the lipids that were contained in the peaks in Fig. 2, lipids were separated by HPLC equipped with a preparative C4 column. As a result, we separated lipids in a total of 17. We determined their chemical structures (Fig. 2E) by proton and carbon NMR (supplemental text), with the aid of heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation analysis (data not shown), and LC-APCIMS and LC-APCIMS/MS analysis (supplemental Table S1). S. lividans harboring pFM1 produced alkylresorcinols (compounds 4-7) as major products and an alkylpyrone (compound 1) as a minor product. SrsA was therefore a type III PKS responsible for phenolic lipid synthesis from the substrates produced by the wild-type S. lividans strain.On the other hand, S. lividans harboring pMF2 produced alkylresorcinol methyl ethers (compounds 8-11), suggesting that SrsB was a methyltransferase acting on alkylresorcinols. In fact, alkylpyrones 1-3 remained unmethylated,"

Here we show that A3G exists in oligomeric states whose composition is dictated primarily by interactions with DNA, with salt playing an important, yet secondary, role. Directional deaminations correlate with the presence of dimers, tetramers, and larger oligomers observed by atomic force microscopy, and random deaminations appear to correlate mainly with monomers. The presence of a 30-nt weakly deaminated “dead” zone located at the 3′-ssDNA end implies the presence of a preferred asymmetric direction for A3G catalysis. Single turnover reaction rates reveal a salt-dependent inhibition of C deamination toward the 3′-ssDNA region, offering a molecular basis underlying A3G deamination polarity. Presteady state analysis demonstrates rapid diffusion-limited A3G-ssDNA binding, a slower salt-dependent conformational change, possibly indicative of DNA wrapping, and long (5–15 min) protein-DNA complex lifetimes. We suggest that diverse A3G oligomerization modes contribute to the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, proviral DNA mutational bias.

Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar) determined that APOBEC3G (A3G), originally called CEM15, a proposed cytidine deaminase based on sequence analysis, is the nonpermissive host factor that blocks virion infectivity factor-defective (Δvif) HIV-1 infection of T cells. The experimental determination that CEM15 was a cytidine deaminase belonging to the APOBEC family followed soon after with experiments demonstrating G → A-induced hypermutation of proviral DNA in a Δvif HIV-1 virion (2Zhang H.

PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and against HIV RNA binding, which forms an intravirion A3G complex in which A3G must be activated by HIV RNase H for DNA deamination to ensue (16Soros V.B. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have shown that A3G-catalyzed deamination occurs processively while exhibiting a 3′ → 5′ polarity favoring deamination toward the 5′-region of ssDNA (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Directional deamination is an intrinsic property of A3G, occurring in the absence of an obvious source of energy (e.g. ATP or GTP) (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and can in principle contribute to the HIV-1 G → A mutational bias, increasing in a 3′-direction in the RNA genome (17Suspene R.

A3G processivity appears consistent with a three-dimensional facilitated diffusion process involving sliding and jumping motions along the DNA (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), where jumping involves microscopic dissociation and reassociation events occurring with the same DNA molecule, rather than diffusion into the surrounding bulk solution (19Berg O.G.

Random processive deaminations also occur with activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an APOBEC family member with a single deaminase domain (25Pham P. Chelico L. Goodman M.F. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that A3G deamination is strongly favored toward the 5′-direction, perhaps because of a catalytic orientation specificity and structural asymmetries in the enzyme (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple catalytic and binding domains in A3G contained in an elongated rod-shaped oligomeric structure found in this deaminase family (26Wedekind J.E. Gillilan R. Janda A.

A3G has been structurally characterized in solution as a tail-to-tail dimer (26Wedekind J.E. Gillilan R. Janda A. Krucinska J. Salter J.D. Bennett R.P. Raina J. Smith H.C. J. Biol.

When bound to DNA, A3G may exist in different oligomeric states, as implied by multiple A3G-DNA bands in gel shift analyses (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 31Iwatani Y. Takeuchi H. Strebel K. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5992-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the present work, using human A3G produced from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, we have applied presteady state kinetic analyses in combination with atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the dynamic and structural determinants of A3G processivity and catalytic polarity. We provide evidence showing that the 3′ → 5′ bias in deamination of C → U appears to be determined by the oligomeric state of the enzyme, with populations of dimers, tetramers, and perhaps larger oligomers favoring directionally biased deamination and most likely monomers catalyzing random deamination. Both the directional and random deamination modes occur with high processivity, readily observable on a time scale of a few seconds. Substrates—DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 3400 DNA/RNA synthesizer and are listed in supplemental Table S1. Fluorescein-dT and pyrrolo-dC were purchased from Glen Research. The partially dsDNA substrates were constructed by annealing with a 1.4-fold molar excess of complementary ssDNA. A circular DNA substrate was constructed by 5′-end phosphorylation of a 118-nt ssDNA substrate with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and subsequent ligation using a linker DNA oligonucleotide. The circular product was then purified after resolution on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A3G and AID Expression and Purification—A baculovirus-expressed GST-A3G protein was constructed as described previously (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A3G recombinant virus was obtained as described previously (32Bransteitter R. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51612-51621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant A3G virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1 and harvested after 72 h. Cells were lysed as described previously (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) in the presence of 50 μg/ml RNase A. Cleared lysates were then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) and subjected to a series of salt washes (0.25–1 m NaCl) before elution in buffer as previously described (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A3G was treated with 0.02 units/μl thrombin (GE Healthcare) for 16 h at 21 °C to release the glutathione S-transferase tag, and subsequently the sample was diluted to 50 mm NaCl and loaded onto a DEAE FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. A3G was eluted at ∼200 mm NaCl by using a linear gradient from 75 to 1000 mm NaCl. Fractions were collected and stored at -70 °C. A3G is ∼95% pure. AID was purified as previously described (32Bransteitter R. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51612-51621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Deamination Assays—A3G activity on ssDNA substrates was measured in reactions containing 50 nm 32P-labeled DNA, 5 or 500 nm A3G in buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and varied amounts of MgCl2 or other salts where indicated) and incubated for 2.5–60 min at 37 °C. ssDNA substrates (0.3–0.5 μm) with an internal fluorescein label were incubated with A3G or AID (20–300 nm), and deaminations were carried out as described above. All reactions with partial dsDNA substrates also contained 30 mm NaCl to stabilize the duplex region. Reactions were terminated by an extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and deaminations were detected by the uracil DNA glycosylase assay, as described previously (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Circular substrates were linearized before PAGE resolution by annealing to a 30-nt complementary oligonucleotide containing an MseI site and incubating with 5 units of MseI for 60 min at 37 °C. Gel band intensities were visualized by phosphorimaging or with a FX fluorescence scanner (Bio-Rad) and then measured with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Presteady state reactions were mechanically sampled and quenched using a KinTek quench-flow instrument. A solution of DNA and A3G at twice the final intended concentration was rapidly mixed in equal volumes and allowed to react for a given amount of time (0.1–180 s) before quenching with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Samples were then treated as described above. Analysis of Processive Deamination by a Single A3G or AID— The analysis of processive deamination described previously (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 25Pham P. Chelico L. Goodman M.F. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was used. This entails the quantification of integrated band intensity of fractions of substrates with a single deamination at the 5′ Cor3′ C or a double deamination at both the 5′ C and 3′ C. The predicted fraction of independent double deaminations is then calculated by multiplying the fraction of all deaminations occurring at the 5′ C (sum of the integrated gel band intensities from deaminations occurring at 5′ C and double deaminations (5′ C and 3′ C)) to the fraction of all deaminations occurring at the 3′ C (sum of the integrated gel band intensities from deaminations occurring at 3′ C and double deaminations (5′ C and 3′ C)). The ratio of the observed fraction of double deaminations (occurring at both 5′ C and 3′ Con the same molecule) to the predicted fraction of independent double deaminations is the “processivity factor” and was used to determine processive (i.e. correlated double) deamination of two target motifs. A ratio larger than 1 indicates that a majority of double deaminations are caused by the same A3G or AID molecule acting processively on both target motifs. Presteady State Anisotropy and Fluorescence Assays—Reactions were at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0 or 5 mm MgCl2. Stopped flow anisotropy measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics Π*180 spectrofluorometer equipped for anisotropy by exciting with vertically polarized light at 494 nm (2.5-nm slit width) from a xenon lamp and monitoring emissions using a 515-nm cut-off filter. To determine on-rates, 0.8–2 μm A3G was incubated in one syringe, and 200 nm fluorescein-labeled 69-nt ssDNA substrate was incubated in a second syringe, before rapidly mixing 50 μl from each syringe and monitoring the change in anisotropy for 0.2 s. The anisotropy change as a function of time was fit to a double exponential equation to obtain on-rates. To determine off-rates, in one syringe, 100 nm fluorescein-labeled 69-nt ssDNA substrate was preincubated with 400 nm A3G. The second syringe contained 10 or 20 μm unlabeled ssDNA substrate. The reaction was initiated by mixing equal volumes of the syringes (50 μl) and monitoring the change in anisotropy for 500–1000 s. The anisotropy change as a function of time was fit to a double exponential decay to obtain off-rates. Stopped flow fluorescence measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics Π*180 spectrofluorometer equipped for fluorescence. The ssDNA containing pyrrolo-C was excited at 335 nm (2-nm slit width) with a xenon-mercury lamp, and emissions were monitored using a 435-nm cut-off filter. To determine fluorescence changes, measured in volts, 2 μm A3G was incubated in one syringe, and 200 nm pyrrolo-C-labeled 69-nt ssDNA substrate was incubated in a second syringe, before rapidly mixing 50 μl from each syringe and monitoring the change in fluorescence emission for 0.6 s. The fluorescence change as a function of time was fit to a double exponential equation to obtain rates. Atomic Force Microscopy—A3G imaging buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) either with or without 5 mm MgCl2 was heated to 65 °C and allowed to cool slowly to dissolve salts. A3G was then diluted to 100 nm in A3G imaging buffer, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration) was added to the sample. Ten microliters of the protein sample were then deposited onto freshly cleaved mica (Spruce Pine Mica Company, Spruce Pine, NC). The sample was rinsed immediately with nanopure water, excess water was wicked from the surface using filter paper, and the surface was then dried using a stream of nitrogen before being placed in the AFM for imaging. For experiments done in the presence of DNA substrate, 200 nm (final concentration) of ssDNA substrate was added to the A3G sample before depositing as for the protein alone. All AFM images were captured in air using either a Nanoscope III or IIIa (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) microscope in tapping mode. Pointprobe Plus tapping mode silicon probes (Agilent, Tempe, AZ) with resonance frequencies of ∼170 kHz were used for imaging. Images were collected at a speed of 2–3 Hz with an image size of 1 × 1 μm at 512 × 512 pixel resolution. Each experiment was repeated at least twice. Volume analysis was done as previously described (33Ratcliff G.C. Erie D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5632-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 34Yang Y. Wang H. Erie D.A. Methods. 2003; 29: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) was used to generate statistical plots. Electrostatic Influence on A3G Deamination Polarity and Processivity— We previously observed that A3G deamination on linear ssDNA exhibits a marked deamination bias, where the rate of deaminating the third C in the 5′-CCC target to U is enhanced significantly as the motif is located further away from the ssDNA 3′-end (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The earlier experiments were performed in the presence of salt (MgCl2) (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To study A3G deamination bias at higher resolution, with and without salt, we used 11 ssDNA substrates, each with a 5′-A(G/T)A CCC AAA hot spot motif in a different location along a 69-nt ssDNA molecule (Fig. 1, A and B). A “dead” zone containing 30 nt was present at the 3′-end of the ssDNA substrate, where the specific activity was <1 pmol/μg/min irrespective of target position or salt concentration (Fig. 1, A and B). We speculate that the 30-nt dead zone may be the optimal space A3G needs at a 3′-ssDNA end to encounter a CCC motif in an orientation allowing catalysis. There was a monotonic increase in A3G specific activity, in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, as the target motif was moved out of the dead zone toward the 5′-end, achieving a maximum specific activity of 11 pmol/μg/min (Fig. 1A). In the absence of MgCl2 the activity of A3G reached a peak near the center of the ssDNA (∼15 pmol/μg/min) and then remained roughly constant before decreasing from about 50 to 69 nt from the 3′-end (0 mm MgCl2) (Fig. 1B). A3G processivity and deamination polarity can be measured simultaneously by placing two CCC motifs on the same ssDNA substrate and having a fluorescein label in between (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 25Pham P. Chelico L. Goodman M.F. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The processivity factor (see “Experimental Procedures”) measures the fraction of correlated double deaminations occurring at two CCC motifs located on the same ssDNA substrate by a single enzyme molecule compared with uncorrelated double deaminations catalyzed independently by two different A3G molecules (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 25Pham P. Chelico L. Goodman M.F. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The analysis requires that less than ∼15% of the substrate be used to maintain single-hit kinetics (35Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A3G processivity did not change significantly as a function of MgCl2 concentration, where the processivity factors are in the range of 5–9 (Fig. 1C). A measurement of A3G deamination polarity on the two C targets, which are out of the deamination dead zone, as a function of salt concentration, shows that deamination at the 5′ C target (100 nt from the 3′-end) is favored over the 3′ C target (36 nt from the 3′-end) by roughly 2-fold at MgCl2 concentrations of >5 mm (5′ C/3′ C deamination ratio; Fig. 1C). The deamination polarity decreased with less salt until, in the near absence of MgCl2, A3G deaminated the C targets with no preference (5′ C/3′ C deamination ratio ∼1; Fig. 1C). The directional bias of A3G deamination was clearly electrostatic in origin as opposed to a specific interaction with Mg2+, because favored deamination toward the 5′-end also occurred with CaCl2, MnCl2, and NaCl (supplemental Fig. S1). In the case of monovalent NaCl, a 20-fold higher concentration was required to obtain a similar 5′-end deamination bias observed for divalent salts. We reexamined the polar and processive properties of A3G on the 118-nt ssDNA (Fig. 1C) but with a 20-nt oligonucleotide annealed between the deamination targets (Fig. 1D). Since A3G bound dsDNA with a low GC content at ∼5-fold lower affinity than ssDNA (supplemental Fig. S2) and does not bind dsDNA with a high GC content (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), a loss in the sliding component of the processive motion is expected (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 31Iwatani Y. Takeuchi H. Strebel K. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5992-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, the jumping component of processivity appeared to be retained, since the processivity factor was reduced from 8 to 4 (Fig. 1D). The lack of deamination bias in the absence of MgCl2 (5′ C/3′ C deamination ratio is 1; Fig. 1D) was expected (see Fig. 1C, 0 mm MgCl2). However, the annealed dsDNA region between the two deamination targets also resulted in a loss of deamination bias in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 (5′ C/3′ C deamination ratio is ∼1; Fig. 1, compare C and D), indicating that the dsDNA between the deamination sites decoupled the two sides of the substrate. The deamination in each single-stranded region depended on the target size for each region, the 36-nt target length from the 3′-end of the 118 nt substrate and the 33-nt target length region between the 5′ C and the dsDNA (Fig. 1D). There is, however, an important distinction to be made regarding the occurrence of the dead zone (Fig. 1, A and B). The ∼30-nt dead zone occurs only at the 3′-end of the ssDNA; there is no internal dead zone created by the dsDNA region, but instead deamination is dependent of the nucleotide target size (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Deamination Polarity on Circular ssDNA Requires an Intervening dsDNA Region—To examine what effect the ssDNA ends have on A3G deamination bias, ends were eliminated by circularizing the molecule depicted in Fig. 1C (Fig. 2A, sketch). A3G shows essentially no deamination bias either with or without MgCl2 on the circular molecule (81 nt/100 nt deamination ratio ∼1.1–1.3; Fig. 2A). Although deamination was slightly inhibited in the presence of MgCl2, the apparent binding constants of the circular DNA compared with its linear counterpart were the same (Kd ∼ 160 nm). A3G was processive on the circular substrate with processivity factors similar to those on the linear substrate (compare Fig. 2A with Fig. 1C).FIGURE 1A3G deamination activity, polarity, and processivity on ssDNA is dependent on MgCl2 and the presence of a dsDNA region. A and B, specific activity of A3G (5 nm) is plotted as a function of the distance (d) of the CCC motif from the 3′-end of a 69-nt ssDNA substrate (50 nm) deaminated in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 (A) or absence of MgCl2 (B).

https://openalex.org/W2007886374,"Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) and its homologue LRP5 serve as Wnt co-receptors that are essential for the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Wnt activation of LRP6 leads to recruitment of the scaffolding protein Axin and inhibition of Axin-mediated phosphorylation/destruction of beta-catenin. We showed that five conserved PPPSP motifs in the LRP6 intracellular domain are required for LRP6 function, and mutation of these motifs together abolishes LRP6 signaling activity. We further showed that Wnt induces the phosphorylation of a prototypic PPPSP motif, which provides a docking site for Axin and is sufficient to transfer signaling activity to a heterologous receptor. However, the activity, regulation, and functionality of multiple PPPSP motifs in LRP6 have not been characterized. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of all five PPPSP motifs in LRP6. We define the core amino acid residues of a prototypic PPPSP motif via alanine scanning mutagenesis and demonstrate that each of the five PPPSP motifs exhibits signaling and Axin binding activity in isolation. We generated two novel phosphorylation-specific antibodies to additional PPPSP motifs and show that Wnt induces phosphorylation of these motifs in the endogenous LRP6 through glycogen synthase kinase 3. Finally, we uncover the critical cooperativity of PPPSP motifs in the full-length LRP6 by demonstrating that LRP6 mutants lacking a single PPPSP motif display compromised function, whereas LRP6 mutants lacking two of the five PPPSP motifs are mostly inactive. This cooperativity appears to reflect the ability of PPPSP motifs to promote the phosphorylation of one another and to interact with Axin synergistically. These results establish the critical role and a common phosphorylation/activation mechanism for the PPPSP motifs in LRP6 and suggest that the conserved multiplicity and cooperativity of the PPPSP motifs represents a built-in amplifier for Wnt signaling by the LRP6 family of receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2023923107,"V accessory proteins from Paramyxoviruses are important in viral evasion of the innate immune response. Here, using a cell survival assay that identifies both inhibitors and activators of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-mediated gene induction, we identified select paramyxoviral V proteins that inhibited double-stranded RNA-mediated signaling; these are encoded by mumps virus (MuV), human parainfluenza virus 2 (hPIV2), and parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), all members of the genus Rubulavirus. We showed that interaction between V and the IRF3/7 kinases, TRAF family member-associated NFkappaB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/inhibitor of kappaB kinase epsilon (IKKe), was essential for this inhibition. Indeed, V proteins were phosphorylated directly by TBK1/IKKe, and this, intriguingly, resulted in lowering of the cellular level of V. Thus, it appears that V mimics IRF3 in both its phosphorylation by TBK1/IKKe and its subsequent degradation. Finally, a PIV5 mutant encoding a V protein that could not inhibit IKKe was much more susceptible to the antiviral effects of double-stranded RNA than the wild-type virus. Because many innate immune response signaling pathways, including those initiated by TLR3, TLR4, RIG-I, MDA5, and DNA-dependent activator of IRFs (DAI), use TBK1/IKKe as the terminal kinases to activate IRFs, rubulaviral V proteins have the potential to inhibit all of them."

https://openalex.org/W1992207446,"Cysteine cathepsins play an indispensable role in proteolytic processing of the major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant chain (Ii) and foreign antigens in a number of antigen presenting cells. Previously it was shown that a fragment of 64 residues present in the p41 form of the Ii (p41 fragment) selectively inhibits the endopeptidase cathepsin L, whereas the activity of cathepsin S remains unaffected. Comparison of structures indicated that the selectivity of interactions between cysteine cathepsins and the p41 fragment is far from being understood and requires further investigation. The p41 fragment has now been shown also to inhibit human cathepsins V, K, and F (also, presumably, O) and mouse cathepsin L with Ki values in the low nanomolar range. These Ki values are sufficiently low to ensure complex formation at physiological concentrations. In addition we have found that the p41 fragment can inhibit cathepsin S too. These findings suggest that regulation of the proteolytic activity of most of the cysteine cathepsins by the p41 fragment is an important and widespread control mechanism of antigen presentation.

In the processes of adaptive immunity, antigenic proteins are cleaved to peptides, some of which are loaded into the binding cleft of MHC 2The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PDB, Protein Data Bank; APC, antigen-presenting cell; DTT, dithiothreitol. 2The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PDB, Protein Data Bank; APC, antigen-presenting cell; DTT, dithiothreitol. class II molecules for presentation on the surface of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (1Bryant P.

The degradation of antigenic proteins takes place in the endocytic compartments (endosomes and lysosomes) rich in proteolytic activity. The current list of protein-degrading enzymes in these compartments includes the group of cysteine cathepsins, asparaginyl endoprotease, the aspartic proteases cathepsins D and E, and thiol reductase GILT (3Villadangos J.A.

Studies on gene knock-out mice showed that the pattern of antigenic peptide generation is not affected by the absence of cathepsins L and S (6Hsieh C.S. deRoos P. Honey K. Beers C. Rudensky A.Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2618-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), indicating redundant and overlapping roles within the group of cysteine cathepsins, although in certain cases specific roles in the degradation of antigens have been assigned to particular proteases (7Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 8Onishi K. Li Y. Ishii K. Hisaeda H. Tang L. Duan X. Dainichi T. Maekawa Y. Katunuma N. Himeno K. Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is thought that the activity of proteases in the endocytic mixture is also regulated by protein inhibitors (4Watts C. Science. 2001; 294: 1294-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A number of different inhibitors of cysteine cathepsins, including cystatins C and F and stefins A and B, have so far been localized in different types of APCs (9Kopitar-Jerala N. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6295-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); however, direct and precise evidence regarding their involvement in the regulation of endosomal protease activity in APCs is still lacking (10Pierre P. Mellman I. Cell. 1998; 93: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 11El-Sukkari D. Wilson N.S. Hakansson K. Steptoe R.J. Grubb A. Shortman K. Villadangos J.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5003-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Even more intriguing and less well investigated is the role of the inhibitory fragment of the p41 form of Ii (p41 fragment). Ii associates with the α and β chains of MHC class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum and is responsible for their proper folding and trafficking to endosomes (12Arunachalam B. Lamb C.A. Cresswell P. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), where the MHC class II molecules are freed from Ii by proteolytic processing of Ii. Ii exists in mouse in two (and in human, four) alternately spliced forms, p31 and p41, distinguished by an additional 64-amino acid segment at the C terminus of p41 (13Strubin M. Berte C. Mach B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3483-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The expression ratio between p31 and p41 forms of Ii depends on the particular type of APC and varies from 10% of the p41 form in B cells, 20–30% in macrophages and dendritic cells, up to 40% in Langerhans cells (14Kampgen E. Koch N. Koch F. Stoger P. Heufler C. Schuler G. Romani N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3014-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The two forms of Ii have identical impact on the folding and trafficking of MHC class II molecules; however, they differ markedly in their functional effects on the presentation of antigens to T cells. The p41 form can impose the degradation pattern to the p31 form when co-expressed in the same cell types, and its presence enhances the antigen presentation (15Fineschi B. Arneson L.S. Naujokas M.F. Miller J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10257-10261Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The p41 form is also more resistant to endosomal proteolysis than the p31 form (16Peterson M. Miller J. Nature. 1992; 357: 596-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These findings were explained in part when the spliced in fragment from the p41 form (p41 fragment) was found bound to cathepsin L (17Ogrinc T. Dolenc I. Ritonja A. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Bevec T. Stoka V. Pungerĕiĕ G. Dolenc I. Turk V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). At the time, however, it was thought that the fragment is an inhibitor specific for cathepsin L, because the activities of cathepsins S and B were not affected. Cathepsin L was therefore designated as the target protease of the p41 fragment in the regulation of endosomal protease activity. However, the more recently discovered cysteine cathepsins V, K, and F could also be potential targets of the p41 fragment, because they have been localized in the cells responsible for the endosomal immune response (19Riese R.J. Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 20Muno D. Sutoh N. Watanabe T. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Eur. J.

Immunology. 2004; 112: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Their interactions with the p41 fragment therefore merit investigation. We show here that the p41 fragment has the ability to regulate and block the activity of a group of cysteine cathepsins in addition to cathepsin L. These findings suggest that the p41 form of Ii plays a wider role than previously thought by regulating the proteolytic activity of endocytic antigen presentation. The cDNA clones for mouse cathepsins L and S, human cathepsin V, and human and mouse p41 invariant chains were obtained at Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fuer Genomforschung GmbH. Expression of Human and Mouse p41 Fragments—The DNA transcripts encoding human and mouse p41 fragments were amplified from human and mouse full-length p41 invariant chain cDNAs by PCR and cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pET-22b(+) in-frame with the N-terminal pelB leader sequence and C-terminal His6 affinity tag sequence. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and grown at 37 °C with constant shaking in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose to an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.5–2.0. Expression of the p41 fragments was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 2 h of induction, the cells were harvested, and the bacterial periplasmic fraction was isolated according to the pET system manual (Novagen). p41 fragments were purified from clear periplasmic supernatants using nickel affinity chromatography on HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) and gel filtration on Superdex-75 HR column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of Cysteine Cathepsins—cDNAs for human and mouse procathepsins L and S and human procathepsin V were amplified by PCR. Site-specific mutations on the cover loops of human cathepsins L and S, namely human cathepsin S R141G and S157D/Q160E/N161E/N163E mutants and the human cathepsin L G139R mutant, were introduced as described (27Sambrook J.M. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 13.36-13.39Google Scholar). PCR products were cloned into a Pichia pastoris expression vector pPIC9K (Invitrogen) previously modified by insertion of a nucleotide sequence encoding a His6 affinity tag between the SnaBI and EcoRI recognition sites. Recombinant plasmids were electroporated into P. pastoris strain GS115 (Invitrogen). Recombinant clones were selected according to the Pichia Expression kit manual (Invitrogen). The clone with the highest protein expression level was grown overnight in BMGY medium at 30 °C with constant shaking. The next day the cells were transferred into BMMY medium containing 1% methanol, and growth was continued under the same conditions. Every 24 h a fresh supply of methanol was added to a final concentration of 1%. After 4 days of expression, yeast cells were removed by centrifugation, and the crude expression medium was applied to a Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the binding buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.5). Almost pure bound fractions of procathepsins were eluted with the binding buffer containing 500 mm imidazole and activated by overnight dialysis against 10 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, pH 5.0 buffer. Dialyzed samples were additionally purified on a Sephadex-75 HR column (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing pure mature cathepsins were collected, dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.5 buffer, and blocked with 10-fold molar excess of methyl-methanethiosulfonate. Inhibition Kinetics—All kinetic experiments were performed at 25 °C using the following assay buffers: 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% (w/v) PEG, pH 6.0, for cathepsins S and F; and 0.1 m sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% (w/v) PEG, pH 5.5, for cathepsins L, V, K, and X. For cathepsins L, S, V, K, and F, benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-methylcoumarin was used as a substrate, and the release of 7-methylcoumarin was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 370 and 460 nm, respectively, in a C-61 spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International). Cathepsin X activity was assayed with dinitrophenyl-Gly-Phe-Phe-Trp substrate, and tryptophan liberation was detected at excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 360 nm, respectively. Active concentrations of cathepsins were determined by active site titration, using the irreversible inhibitor E-64, and human and mouse p41 fragments by titration with cathepsin L. Inhibition experiments were performed under pseudo first-order reaction conditions with inhibitor concentrations at least 10-fold higher than the enzyme concentrations with less than 10% substrate consumption during experiments. Based on previous results (18Bevec T. Stoka V. Pungerĕiĕ G. Dolenc I. Turk V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) we assumed a simple, competitive mechanism of inhibition without a pre-equilibrium step. For every enzyme-inhibitor pair at least five measurements were performed with increasing concentrations of the p41 fragments mixed with the substrate solution (10 μm final concentration in the reaction buffer) to a final volume of 1960 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of 40 μl of enzyme. Progress curves for inhibition of cathepsins L and V showed an exponential approach to a final linear rate and were fitted by nonlinear regression to the corresponding equation (28Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 105-192Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Association and dissociation rate constants (ka and kd) for individual enzyme-inhibitor pairs were determined by linear regression analysis as described (29Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). Ki values were calculated as Ki = kd/ka. The binding of the p41 fragment to cathepsins S, K, and F was too rapid to allow ka values to be determined. Therefore, only Ki values were determined for these enzyme-inhibitor pairs using the equilibrium method according to Greco and Hakala (30Greco W.R. Hakala M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12104-12109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ki values were calculated from the steady-state velocities of substrate hydrolysis in the presence of increasing concentrations of inhibitor. The Ki values were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis. Molecular Modeling—The three-dimensional models of the human cathepsins O and W and mouse cathepsins L and S were generated by the computer program MODELLER (31Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10539) Google Scholar) using the cathepsin L crystal structure (PDB entry 1ICF) from the complex with the p41 fragment (32Gunĕar G. Pungerĕiĕ G. Klemenĕiĕ I. Turk V. Turk D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) as the template. The mouse p41 fragment model was generated analogously using the human p41 fragment structure. Hypothetical models of complexes between cysteine cathepsins and the p41 fragments were made by superposition of the crystal structures of human cathepsins S (PDB entry 1GLO (33Turkenburg J.P. Lamers M.B. Brzozowski A.M. Wright L.M. Hubbard R.E. Sturt S.L. Williams D.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)), K (PDB entry 1MEM (34McGrath M.E. Klaus J.L. Barnes M.G. Bromme D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)), V (PDB entry 1FH0 (35Somoza J.R. Zhan H. Bowman K.K. Yu L. Mortara K.D. Palmer J.T. Clark J.M. McGrath M.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12543-12551Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)), and F (PDB entry 1M6D (36Somoza J.R. Palmer J.T. Ho J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) and the three-dimensional models of other cathepsins to the structure of cathepsin L in complex with the p41 fragment. The position of the model of the mouse p41 fragment was obtained by superimposition on the p41 fragment in the crystal structure of the same complex. The superimposition was carried out by minimization of the sum of squares of the distances between pairs of structurally equivalent C-α atoms using the program MAIN (37Turk D. Weiterentwicklung eines Programms fuer Molekülgraphik und Elektrondichte-Manipulation und Seine Anwendung auf Verschiedene Protein-Strukturaufklërungen. Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Germany1992Google Scholar). The p41 fragment fold and its binding mode are known from the crystal structure of the complex of p41 fragment bound to cathepsin L (32Gunĕar G. Pungerĕiĕ G. Klemenĕiĕ I. Turk V. Turk D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The p41 fragment has a wedge-shaped structure that binds into the active site cleft of the target protease with its narrow edge (Fig. 1A). Its sequence contains numerous charged residues: six negatively (Glu199, Glu200, Asp217, Glu218, Glu243, and Glu257) and nine positively charged (Lys196, His203, His208, Arg213, Lys215, Arg248, Arg250, His252, and His253). All six carboxyl groups, plus the C-terminal carboxyl, are positioned at the top on both sides of the wide part of the wedge, whereas all positive charges except Leu196 are positioned on the lower part (Fig. 1B). The asymmetric distribution of the charged residues indicates a significant dipole moment of the molecule, which suggests its relevance in the binding to target proteases. Comparison of the crystal structure with the putative complex between the p41 fragment and cathepsin S suggested that the tight binding to cathepsin L (Ki = 0.0017 nm) and the lack of inhibition of cathepsin S (18Bevec T. Stoka V. Pungerĕiĕ G. Dolenc I. Turk V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) arise from unfavorable electrostatic and steric interactions between the p41 fragment and the loop covering the top of the right domain (Ile136 to Asp162 (cathepsin L numbering) and is further referred to as the cover loop). These interactions are absent in cystatin-like inhibitor binding and were thought to be specific to the p41 fragment (38Miheliĕ M. Turk D. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The structural comparison points to the cathepsin S residue Arg141, which stands out of the cathepsin S surface in contrast to Gly139 of cathepsin L, being the most perturbing factor of this interaction. Arg141 may clash sterically with the p41 fragment surface, as well as carrying the repulsive positive charge (Fig. 2A). To verify the relevance of the role of Arg141, cathepsins L and S and their mutants (cathepsin L G139R and cathepsin S R141G) were prepared. As expected, wild type cathepsin L binds the recombinant p41 fragment with high affinity (Ki = 0.0055 nm) (Fig. 2B). The inhibition constant is in good agreement with previously published data (18Bevec T. Stoka V. Pungerĕiĕ G. Dolenc I. Turk V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar); however, in contrast to expectations, a measurable affinity between the p41 fragment and cathepsin S was observed (Ki = 208 nm). The human cathepsin S R141G mutant exhibited an ∼7-fold greater binding affinity for the p41 fragment (Ki = 30 nm) than native cathepsin S. The reverse substitution G139R in cathepsin L, however, resulted in only a 2-fold decrease in binding affinity (Ki = 0.01 nm) (Fig. 2B). The arginine side chain thus appears to be flexible enough to escape the steric clashes with the p41 fragment residues, and its repulsive charge is not sufficient to reduce the binding affinity substantially. These data demonstrate that the arginine side chain is one reason, but not the only reason, for the observed differences in binding. Hence, the contribution of a single residue plays a minor role in determining the total strength of interactions, suggesting that the observed differences arise from a group of interactions with the cover loop residues of the enzymes. As seen in Fig. 2A the cover loop on the R-domain of cathepsin L contains eight residues with negatively charged (Asp137, Glu141, Glu148, Glu153, Asp155, Glu159, Asp160, and Asp162) and two with positively charged groups (His140 and Lys147). (We assume that the histidine residues are positively charged in the acidic conditions mimicking the endosomal environment.) Of these, Glu141, Asp160, and Asp162 are positioned in the immediate vicinity of the positively charged residues of the p41 fragment, His208, Arg213, and His253, and the slightly higher positioned Lys215 (Fig. 2A). In contrast to human cathepsin L, human cathepsin S can offer only two negative charges, Asp139 and Glu155, whose positions correspond to the cathepsin L residues Asp137 and Glu153, and three positively charged residues, Arg141, His142, and Lys149, whose positions correspond to cathepsin L residues Gly139, His140, and Lys147. Because the effects of arginine/glycine substitutions only partially explained the differences in binding of the two enzymes to the p41 fragment, we have tried to transform the cathepsin S cover loop into that of cathepsin L. Although we were unable to express the cathepsin S mutant with all the cathepsin L negatively charged groups introduced, we were successful in expressing the 4-fold mutant (S157D, Q160E, N161E, and N163D). This mutant was inhibited by the p41 fragment with Ki = 0.27 nm, which is 770 times stronger than the wild type enzyme, demonstrating that the negative charges on the surface of the cover loop indeed play a crucial role in determining the strength of interactions of cathepsins with the p41 fragment. This finding prompted us to inspect the structures of other available cysteine cathepsins, endopeptidases F, K, and V, and exopeptidase cathepsin X. Comparison of their structures and sequences revealed that the composition of the cover loop of cathepsin V is the most similar to that of cathepsin L, whereas the cover loop of cathepsin F is least similar (Fig. 3, A and B). The cathepsin V cover loop contains a cluster of four negative charges Asp137, Glu153, Asp155, and Asp162 equipositioned to Asp137, Glu153, Asp155, and Asp162 of cathepsin L, and three positively charged residues, His140, Lys147, and Lys159, equipositioned to His140, Lys147, and Glu159 of cathepsin L (Fig. 3A). Cathepsin K also has four negatively charged residues Asp136, Asp152, Glu153, and Asp158; however, they are positioned differently from those of cathepsin V and lack the aspartate at position Asn161 (equipositioned to cathepsin L Asp162) and the glutamate at position Ser154 corresponding to the Glu153 residue of cathepsin L. The two aspartates, 160 and 162, of cathepsin L, which are positioned in the complex structure in the vicinity of the p41 fragment, are neutral asparagines in the cathepsin K sequence. Cathepsin F, however, has only a single negatively charged residue Asp158, equivalent to Asp162 of cathepsin L, directly involved in interactions with the p41 fragment. Its four positively charged residues Arg145, His146, Arg152 and R155A point away from the p41 fragment and are unlikely to severely disturb the formation of the complex, as in the case of cathepsin S. In addition, the helix of cathepsin F starts a residue earlier by turning right instead of left, making the active site cleft of cathepsin F wider by more than 3 Å than in the other cathepsins. Cathepsin F has actually no equivalent residue to cathepsin L Gly139; its sequentially equivalent Pro139 side chain coincides with the side chain of His140, whereas the Phe143 side chain points away from the sequentially equivalent Phe146 of cathepsin S. This comparison suggests that cathepsin F can also be inhibited by the p41 fragment. The analysis of the cover loop of carboxypeptidase cathepsin X does not appear relevant because the p41 fragment, like the cystatins (39Nagler D.K. Zhang R. Tam W. Sulea T. Purisima E.O. Menard R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12648-12654Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), would not be able to bind to the active site cleft because of steric clashes with the mini-loop residues positioned inside the active site cleft. The inhibition constants of the p41 fragment with cathepsins V, K, and F (Table 1) reveal the same order of inhibition as suggested by visual inspection. To our surprise however, cathepsin V, the strongest inhibitor among them, is inhibited by the p41 fragment with a Ki (Ki = 0.0072 nm) almost equal to that of cathepsin L. Cathepsin K inhibition was intermediate (Ki = 0.09 nm), and the cathepsin F inhibition constant was an additional order of magnitude higher (Ki = 0.51 nm); however, it was still significant and lower than the Ki value with cathepsin S. Cathepsin X, like exopeptidases cathepsin B and C, was not inhibited at all (18Bevec T. Stoka V. Pungerĕiĕ G. Dolenc I. Turk V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The similar Ki values for cathepsins L and V suggest that the four acidic residues of cathepsin V are important mediators of the binding affinity of the p41 fragment. The absence of the two negatively charged residues in cathepsin K (Ser154 and Asn161) and the presence of the two different negatively charged ones (Glu153 and Asp158) appear to compensate for most of the lost interaction strength. The absence of the negative charges, other than Asp158 in cathepsin F, however, results in the Ki being increased by 2 orders of magnitude when compared with cathepsin L.TABLE 1Interaction of human and mouse p41 fragments with cysteine cathepsinska × 10–7kd × 105Kim–1 s–1s–1mHuman p41 fragment Human cathepsin V0.66 ± 0.034.75 ± 0.63(7.21 ± 2.03) × 10–12 Human cathepsin KNDaND indicates not determinedND(90 ± 8) × 10–12 Human cathepsin FNDND(0.51 ± 0.09) × 10–9 Human cathepsin XNDND>1000 × 10–9Mouse cathepsin L1.13 ± 0.031.98 ± 0.18(1.49 ± 0.09) × 10–12Mouse cathepsin SNDND(113 ± 8) × 10–9Mouse p41 fragment Mouse cathepsin L1.8 ± 0.4013.2 ± 0.75(7.22 ± 1,7) × 10–12 Mouse cathepsin SNDND(85.4 ± 4) × 10–9a ND indicates not determined Open table in a new tab Comparison of the sequences of the cover loop region of the only two yet uncharacterized cathepsins, O and W (Fig. 3, A and B), suggests that cathepsin O could be inhibited by the p41 fragment with a Ki value comparable with that of cathepsin K. The two (Asp139 and Glu159) out of three negatively charged residues in the third region (Asp139, Asp145, and Glu159) are presumably in direct contact with the positively charged residues of the p41 fragment. The cover loop of cathepsin W, however, resembles more the loop of cathepsin S, suggesting that the inhibition of cathepsin W is poor, if measurable at all. This suggestion is only relevant subject to the assumption that the two insertions specific for the cathepsin W sequence do not modify the fold of the cover loop and the active site cleft structure. Do Mouse and Human Cathepsins and p41 Fragments Behave the Same?—Mouse is the most commonly used animal model to study the immune response mechanisms of mammals. It is therefore important to know to what extent the findings from mouse are applicable to humans. Comparison of human and mouse p41 fragments indicates that they should exhibit the same properties; they both have the same pronounced asymmetric distribution of charges at essentially the same positions (Fig. 4, A and C). Kinetic data indeed show that the mouse p41 fragment inhibits human and mouse cathepsins L with very similar inhibition constants; the Ki values for cathepsins L and S are 0.007 and 85.0 nm, respectively (Table 1). Cross-inhibition experiments in which interactions were measured for human and mouse cathepsins with p41 fragments gave similar results (Table 1), again confirming that the amino acid differences between the mouse and human p41 fragments do not affect their inhibitory properties. The data do, however, reveal that the sequences of mouse and human proteins have been optimized to fit each other better than across the species. An interesting observation, reflected also in the Ki values, is that the distribution of charges in the cover loop of mouse cathepsin L is more similar to the distribution of charges in the human cathepsin V cover loop sequence than to that in human cathepsin L, indicating that perhaps mouse cathepsin L and the human cathepsin V are the real orthologs and not mouse and h"

However, the translation of this to the clinic has proven problematic. This is likely due to the complex nature of the surgical gene delivery and cell-based approaches adopted to deliver proteinaceous neurotrophic factors to targets within the central nervous system. We investigated the ability of a novel, orally active, nonpeptide neurotrophic factor inducer, PYM50028 (Cogane), to restore dopaminergic function after 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) -induced damage to mesencephalic neurons in vitro and in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) -lesioned mice. In rat mesencephalic neurons, administration of PYM50028, either before or after MPP(+), significantly prevented and reversed both MPP(+)-induced neuronal atrophy and cell loss. These effects were potent and of a magnitude equivalent to those achieved by a combination of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Oral administration of PYM50028 (10 mg/kg/day for 60 days) to MPTP-lesioned mice, commencing after a striatal impairment was evident, resulted in a significant elevation of striatal GDNF (297%) and BDNF (511%), and attenuated the loss of striatal dopaminergic transporter levels and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. PYM50028 did not inhibit monoamine oxidase B in vitro, nor did it alter brain levels of MPP(+) in vivo. PYM50028 has neuroprotective and neurorestorative potential and is in clinical development for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease."

The atheroprotective actions of unidirectional laminar shear stress led us to explore its influence on endothelial cell expression of complement inhibitory proteins CD59 and decay-accelerating factor. Human umbilical vein and aortic endothelial cells were exposed to laminar shear stress (12 dynes/cm2) or disturbed flow (±5 dynes/cm2 at 1Hz) in a parallel plate flow chamber. Laminar shear induced a flow rate-dependent increase in steady-state CD59 mRNA, reaching 4-fold at 12 dynes/cm2. Following 24–48 h of laminar shear stress, cell surface expression of CD59 was up-regulated by 100%, whereas decay-accelerating factor expression was unchanged. The increase in CD59 following laminar shear was functionally significant, reducing C9 deposition and complement-mediated lysis of flow-conditioned endothelial cells by 50%. Although CD59 induction was independent of PI3-K, ERK1/2 and nitric oxide, an RNA interference approach demonstrated dependence upon an ERK5/KLF2 signaling pathway. In contrast to laminar shear stress, disturbed flow failed to induce endothelial cell CD59 protein expression. Likewise, CD59 expression on vascular endothelium was significantly higher in atheroresistant regions of the murine aorta exposed to unidirectional laminar shear stress, when compared with atheroprone areas exposed to disturbed flow. We propose that up-regulation of CD59 via ERK5/KLF2 activation leads to endothelial resistance to complement-mediated injury and protects from atherogenesis in regions of laminar shear stress.

Mechanisms implicated in complement deposition on the surface of EC include activation of the classical pathway by immune complexes, anti-phospholipid, and anti-endothelial cell antibodies (6Fleming S.D.

Ahearn J.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Alternatively, activation of the lectin pathway may follow exposure to hypoxia reoxygenation (8Collard C.D. Vakeva A. Morrissey M.A. Agah A. Rollins S.A. Reenstra W.R. Buras J.A. Meri S. Stahl G.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1549-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Complement activation on the surface of human EC is regulated by membrane-bound inhibitory proteins: decay-accelerating factor (DAF) (CD55), membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), and CD59. The genes encoding DAF and MCP are clustered on the long arm of chromosome 1, whereas that for CD59 is located on chromosome 11. These proteins use distinct mechanisms for complement regulation. DAF prevents the formation and accelerates the decay of C3 and C5 convertases (9Lublin D.M. Atkinson J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 35-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), whereas MCP accelerates the degradation of C3b and C4b by Factor I (10Liszewski M.K. Post T.W. Atkinson J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 431-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). CD59 inhibits the terminal pathway of complement activation, preventing incorporation of C9 into the MAC (11Davies A. Simmons D.L. Hale G. Harrison R.A. Tighe H. Lachmann P.J. Waldmann H. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 637-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 12Okada N. Harada R. Fujita T. Okada H. Int. Immunol. 1989; 1: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Complement activation may be an early prelesional event in atherogenesis, as revealed by colocalization of C5b-9 with lipid deposits in the tunica intima prior to monocyte recruitment (13Seifert P.S. Hugo F. Hansson G.K. Bhakdi S. Lab. Investig. 1989; 60: 747-754PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental models suggest that vascular endothelial injury is the earliest detectable event in atherogenesis. Apoptosis of EC occurs preferentially at bifurcations and curvatures, where denudation of vascular endothelium enhances the risk of plaque development and local thrombosis. Moreover, aging and exposure to oxidized low density lipoprotein or reactive oxygen species increases EC apoptosis, consistent with a role in the initiation of atherogenesis (14Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition to local lipid-related activation of complement, exposure of the underlying extracellular matrix, resulting from apoptosis of EC, may further reinforce complement activation (13Seifert P.S. Hugo F. Hansson G.K. Bhakdi S. Lab. Investig. 1989; 60: 747-754PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hindmarsh E.J. Marks R.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 6128-6136PubMed Google Scholar). The susceptibility of branch points and curvatures to atherosclerosis is in large part related to exposure to disturbed blood flow (DF), with low shear reversing or oscillatory flow patterns. In contrast, the arterial tree exposed to unidirectional laminar shear stress (LSS) >10 dynes/cm2 tends to be protected (16Cunningham K.S. Gotlieb A.I. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). This is reflected in the phenotype of EC exposed to LSS, typically characterized by enhanced NO biosynthesis, prolonged cell survival, and an anticoagulant, anti-adhesive cell surface (17Dimmeler S. Hermann C. Galle J. Zeiher A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18Sheikh S. Rainger G. Gale Z. Rahman M. Nash G. Blood. 2003; 102: 2828-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Yamawaki H. Lehoux S. Berk B.C. Circulation. 2003; 108: 1619-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, endothelium exposed to DF exhibits reduced levels of eNOS, increased apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen species, permeability to low density lipoprotein, and leukocyte adhesion (reviewed in Ref. 16Cunningham K.S. Gotlieb A.I. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The importance of unidirectional LSS for vascular endothelial cytoprotection, together with the observation that LSS protects against complement-induced EC activation and chemokine synthesis (20Urbich C. Fritzenwanger M. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 2000; 101: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), led us to explore whether LSS may be protective against complement-mediated vascular injury through suppression of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex. We show for the first time that CD59, the predominant membrane-bound regulator of the MAC, is preferentially induced by unidirectional atheroprotective LSS, providing enhanced protection against complement activation. This response was independent of NO and dependent upon an ERK5, Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) signaling pathway. In contrast, an atheroprone-disturbed flow waveform failed to increase CD59 protein expression. These observations were confirmed in vivo, where CD59 expression was significantly higher on arterial EC in atherosclerosis-resistant areas of the murine aorta. Thus, up-regulation of CD59 may represent an important component of endothelial cytoprotection in regions of LSS, preserving vascular integrity and minimizing both complement activation and atherogenesis. Materials—Anti-human CD59 mAb (IgG1) Bric 229 was purchased from the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory (Bristol, UK). The anti-murine CD59 mAb (MEL-4) was a gift from BP Morgan (University of Wales School of Medicine). Anti-DAF mAb 1H4 (IgG1) and anti-MCP mAb TRA-2–10 (IgG1) were gifts from D. Lublin and J. Atkinson, respectively (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). UO126 and NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) were from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and LY290042 was from Merck Biosciences (Nottingham, UK). Other products were from Sigma-Aldrich. Endothelial Cell Exposure to Flow—Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVEC) and human aortic ECs (HAEC; purchased from Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured as described (21Mason J.C. Ahmed Z. Mankoff R. Lidington E.A. Ahmad S.R. Bhatia V. Kinderlerer A. Randi A.M. Haskard D.O. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The use of human EC was approved by Hammersmith Hospitals Research Ethics Committee (reference number 06/Q0406/21). Confluent HUVEC or HAEC cultures were exposed to control static conditions, high shear unidirectional laminar flow (up to 20 dynes/cm2), or disturbed flow with directional changes of flow at 1Hz (± 5 dynes/cm2) for up to 48 h using a parallel plate flow chamber (Cytodyne, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (22Chappell D.C.

Cell viability was assessed by examination of EC monolayers using phase contrast microscopy, cell counting, and estimation of trypan blue exclusion. RNAi Design and Transfection—The short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO) or Ambion (Austin, TX). siRNA sequences for KLF2 were sense, 5′-GCCCUACCACUGCAACUGGUU-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCAGUUGCAGUGGUAGGGCUU-3′); siRNA sequences for ERK5 were sense, 5′-GGCUCGGCUUGGUUAAUUCtt-3′, and antisense, 5′-GAAUAAUCCAAGCCGAGCCtc-3′. Corresponding negative control sequences were commercially synthesized. For siRNA delivery, HUVECs were plated at 3 × 105 cells/well on fibronectin-coated glass slides in endothelial cell basal medium (Cambrex BioScience, Wokingham, UK) to obtain 50% confluency. siRNA targeting KLF2, ERK5, or scrambled control siRNA (all at 10–50 nm) was transfected into EC using Oligofectamine-based transfection in endothelial cell basal medium. EC were cultured for 48 h in endothelial cell basal medium and analyzed for target gene expression by qrt-PCR or immunoblotting. The specificity of siRNA targeting was confirmed using a second set of sequences. Quantitative Real Time (qrt)-PCR— qrt-PCR was performed using an iCycler (Bio-Rad) as described (24Kinderlerer A.R.

DNase-1-digested total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using 1 μm oligo(dT) and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was amplified in a 25-μl reaction containing 5 μl of cDNA template, 12.5 μl of iSYBR supermix (Bio-Rad), and 0.5 pm sense and antisense gene-specific primers and double distilled H2O.

Northern Blotting—RNA was extracted from HUVEC using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, transferred overnight to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and analyzed by specific hybridization to a radiolabeled cDNA probe for human CD59 (gift from H. Waldmann, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK) as previously described (26Mason J.C. Yarwood H. Sugars K. Morgan B.P. Davies K.A. Haskard D.O. Blood. 1999; 94: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integrated density values for each band were obtained with an Alpha Innotech ChemiImager 5500 Alpha Innotech (San Leandro, CA), normalized with respect to the 28 S band on ethidium bromide-stained rRNA loading patterns and expressed as percentage change from control. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed as previously described using a Beckman-Coulter flow cytometer (Luton, UK) (26Mason J.C. Yarwood H. Sugars K. Morgan B.P. Davies K.A. Haskard D.O. Blood. 1999; 94: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results are expressed as the relative fluorescent intensity, representing the mean fluorescent intensity with test mAb divided by the mean fluorescent intensity using an isotype-matched irrelevant mAb. Complement Deposition Assays—Cell surface C9 deposition and complement-mediated lysis was assessed by flow cytometry as described previously (24Kinderlerer A.R. Steinberg R. Johns M. Harten S.K. Lidington E.A. Haskard D.O. Maxwell P.H. Mason J.C. Arthritis Res Ther. 2006; 8: R130-R141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). EC were exposed to LSS at 12 dynes/cm2 for 24 h, harvested, and suspended in veronal-buffered saline containing 0.1% gelatin. The noncomplement fixing, inhibitory CD59 mAb BRIC 229 (27van den Berg C.W. Morgan B.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4095-4101PubMed Google Scholar) was used at 20 μg/ml. For analysis of C9 deposition, EC were exposed to normal human serum (NHS) or heat-inactivated NHS for up to 3 h at 37 °C. C9 binding was detected with mouse anti-human C5b-C9 Technoclone (Vienna, Austria) and fluorescein isothiocyanate rabbit anti-mouse Ig. Complement-mediated cell lysis was quantified by assessing the percentage of cells permeable to propidium iodide, by flow cytometry, following exposure to NHS or heat-inactivated NHS for 3 h. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal immunostaining and microscopy was by modification of an established method (28Bhatia V.K. Yun S. Leung V. Grimsditch D.C. Benson G.M. Botto M.B. Boyle J.J. Haskard D.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 416-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks) were killed by CO2 inhalation, and the vasculature perfused-fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Thoracic organs were removed en bloc and equilibrated in OCT for 18 h. The aortic arch was dissected, and a transverse slice was cut that encompassed the circumference of the aorta at the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk, the brachiocephalic trunk itself, and the proximal portions of its branches (right common carotid and right subclavian). The block was frozen in isopentane, and serial cryostat sections were cut and incubated with 10% normal goat serum (Dako, Ely, UK), followed by rat anti-mouse CD59 mAb MEL-4 for 30 min. The sections were washed and incubated with 1:200 goat anti-rat AlexaFluor 568 (Molecular Probes and Invitrogen). The sections used for quantitation were stained only for CD59. The adjacent sections were immunolabeled with anti-CD59 as before and then incubated with biotinylated Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed by streptavidin-AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen). Other serial sections were immunolabeled with anti-CD59, followed by AlexaFluor 488, and then incubated with Cy3-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-smooth muscle actin (clone α-1A4, Sigma). After the second label, the sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 10 min with TOPRO-3 (Molecular Probes) and mounted in phosphate-buffered saline/glycerol. Sections were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta inverted confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY). Scan and photomultiplier settings were set to optimize signal/noise ratio for each emission wavelength. Using these photomultiplier settings, there was no detectable cross-over between channels. However, to eliminate any possibility of data skew by signal contamination, quantitation was performed on CD59-only stained sections. Processing was with Zeiss LSM Image Browser and quantitation by export of the images into Image J. The regions of interest were selected, and the histogram function was used to calculate the distribution of pixel intensities on the red channel (corresponding to AlexaFluor 568). Animals—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan Olac (Bicester, Oxford, UK) and housed under controlled climactic conditions in microisolator cages with autoclaved bedding. Irradiated food and drinking water were readily available. All of the animals were housed and studied according to UK Home Office guidelines. Sentinel mice were housed alongside test animals and regularly screened for a standard panel of murine pathogens. Statistics—The data are expressed as the means of individual experiments ± S.E. The data were grouped according to treatment and analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA), and the analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction or an unpaired Students t test. Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis was used to compare immunofluorescence intensity in different regions of the murine aorta using an Excel plug-in Stat-Plus Professional. The differences were considered significant at p values of <0.05. CD59 Expression Is Induced by Unidirectional LSS—To assess the influence of shear stress on the surface expression of the complement inhibitory proteins MCP, DAF, and CD59, HUVEC in a parallel plate flow chamber were exposed to unidirectional LSS (12 dynes/cm2) for up to 48 h and analyzed by flow cytometry. No change in the cell surface expression of either MCP or DAF was seen (Fig. 1). In contrast, a significant increase in CD59 expression of up to 2.5-fold was seen following exposure to unidirectional LSS for 24 h, and this was sustained at 48 h (Fig. 1). Northern analysis detected alternatively spliced variants of CD59 (as described previously (24Kinderlerer A.R. Steinberg R. Johns M. Harten S.K. Lidington E.A. Haskard D.O. Maxwell P.H. Mason J.C. Arthritis Res Ther. 2006; 8: R130-R141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) and demonstrated that induction by LSS was associated with an increase in mRNA, first detectable 2 h after the onset of flow and continuing to rise over 16 h. This pattern was confirmed by qrt-PCR, which revealed a sustained increase of up to 6-fold, 24–48 h post-initiation of LSS (Fig. 2). To determine whether LSS-induced up-regulation was dependent upon the magnitude of shear force, HUVEC were exposed to increasing LSS for 24 h, and changes in CD59 mRNA were analyzed by qrt-PCR. CD59 mRNA levels rose progressively as LSS increased to 12 dynes/cm2 (Fig. 2C). Experiments performed on HAEC to represent EC derived from a vascular bed affected by atherosclerosis also showed a significant up-regulation of CD59 mRNA and cell surface protein in response to LSS (Fig. 3). The extracellular matrix upon which EC are cultured may also influence their responsiveness to shear stress (29Orr A.W. Sanders J.M. Bevard M. Coleman E. Sarembock I.J. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To address this, HUVEC were cultured on fibronectin, gelatin, and collagen type I and exposed to LSS for 24 h. However, the nature of the underlying matrix did not alter the ability of LSS to induce CD59, with equivalent induction seen under all conditions (data not shown). LSS-induced CD59 Is Cytoprotective—To address the functional significance of CD59 up-regulation, the effect of LSS on cell surface deposition of C9 was measured. HUVEC were cultured under static conditions or in the presence of LSS (12 dynes/cm2) for 24 h prior to exposure to 20% NHS and flow cytometric analysis, using an antibody against a neo-epitope on C9 that is revealed upon C5b-9 complex formation. In addition, complement-mediated EC lysis was quantified using propidium iodide uptake (24Kinderlerer A.R. Steinberg R. Johns M. Harten S.K. Lidington E.A. Haskard D.O. Maxwell P.H. Mason J.C. Arthritis Res Ther. 2006; 8: R130-R141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Exposure to NHS resulted in measurable C9 deposition on the surface of HUVEC cultured under static conditions. A significant reduction in C9 deposition was seen on EC exposed to LSS (p < 0.05), with levels comparable with that seen on EC exposed to serum that had been heat-inactivated to prevent complement activation (Fig. 4A). Likewise, LSS conferred protection against complement-mediated lysis when compared with EC cultured under static conditions (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B). The inhibitory, noncomplement fixing CD59 mAb BRIC 229 (27van den Berg C.W. Morgan B.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4095-4101PubMed Google Scholar) was used to confirm the role of CD59 in protection against lysis. BRIC 229 reversed the protective effect of LSS, and its presence resulted in lysis of >75% of EC (Fig. 4B). Mechanosensitive Signaling Pathways Regulating Expression of CD59—Activation of signaling pathways such as those regulated by PI3-K/Akt and ERK1/2 and enhanced eNOS-dependent NO biosynthesis may contribute to the vasculoprotective effects of LSS (30Garin G. Berk B.C. Endothelium. 2006; 13: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, we initially adopted a pharmacological approach to explore the role of these pathways in the induction of CD59 by LSS. HUVEC were pretreated with PI3-K antagonist LY290042, or MEK-1 inhibitor UO126, at concentrations we have shown to inhibit phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2, respectively (31Lidington E.A. Steinberg R. Kinderlerer A.R. Landis R.C. Ohba M. Samarel A. Haskard D.O. Mason J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C1437-C1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Steinberg R. Harari O.A.

Inclusion of LY290042 had no significant inhibitory effect on the induction of CD59 mRNA in response to LSS (Fig. 5A). Although UO126 reduced expression, this did not reach significance (Fig. 5B). Likewise, the presence of nitricoxide synthase inhibitor l-NMMA, at concentrations capable of inhibiting the induction of CD59 by atorvastatin under hypoxic conditions (24Kinderlerer A.R. Steinberg R. Johns M. Harten S.K. Lidington E.A. Haskard D.O. Maxwell P.H. Mason J.C. Arthritis Res Ther. 2006; 8: R130-R141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), did not inhibit LSS-induced CD59 protein (Fig. 5C) or mRNA expression (not shown). In contrast, inclusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide abrogated the LSS-mediated increase in CD59 mRNA (Fig. 5D), suggesting dependence upon de novo synthesis of an inducible intermediary protein in response to LSS. Furthermore, it has been reported that in addition to MEK-1, UO126 may inhibit ERK5 (33Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar); hence the decrease in flow-induced CD59 mRNA observed in the presence of UO126 (Fig. 5B) may in fact reflect a reduction in ERK5 activation. These data, combined with (i) the identification of ERK5 (BMK-1) as a shear-inducible cytoprotective member of the MAPK family (34Pi X. Yan C. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), (ii) identification of the LSS-inducible transcription factor KLF2 as a downstream target of ERK5 (35Sohn S.J. Li D. Lee L.K. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8553-8566Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Parmar K.M. Larman H.B. Dai G. Zhang Y. Wang E.T. Moorthy S.N. Kratz J.R. Lin Z. Jain M.K.

Investig. 2006; 116: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), and (iii) microarray data suggesting overexpression of KLF2 may increase CD59 mRNA in EC (36Parmar K.M. Larman H.B. Dai G.

The KLFs are a subclass of the zinc finger transcription factors, within which KLF2 has emerged as an important factor in the maintenance of endothelial homeostasis (37SenBanerjee S. Lin Z. Atkins G.B. Greif D.M. Rao R.M. Kumar A. Feinberg M.W. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Luscinskas F.W. Michel T.M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Garcia-Cardena G. Jain M.K. J. Exp.

Blood. 2006; 107: 4354-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We adopted an siRNA approach, which reduced the expression of ERK5 transcripts in EC by 80% (supplemental Fig. S1A). Further analysis demonstrated that the induction of both CD59 mRNA (supplemental Fig. S2A) and surface protein by LSS was significantly attenuated in HUVEC treated with ERK5 siRNA, when compared with scrambled siRNA controls (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A). LSS significantly induced expression of KLF2 mRNA, a response that was reversed by the presence of specific siRNA oligonucleotides targeting KLF2 (supplemental Fig. S1B). In addition, knockdown of ERK5 significantly inhibited induction of KLF2 by LSS (supplemental Fig. S1C). Analysis of CD59 mRNA in HUVEC pretreated with KLF2-specific siRNA demonstrated that LSS induction of CD59 was inhibited, an effect that was not seen with scrambled control siRNA (supplemental Fig. S2B). This was further confirmed by flow cytometric analysis, which showed that cell surface expression of CD59 on EC treated with KLF2 siRNA and exposed to LSS was equivalent to that on static cells (Fig. 6B). CD59 Expression Is Differentially Regulated by LSS and DF—Atheroprotected and atheroprone regions of the aorta are exposed to unidirectional LSS and a low velocity reversing flow pattern, respectively. To compare the effect of these different flow patterns on CD59 expression, EC were exposed to LSS (12 dynes/cm2), or an osc"
https://openalex.org/W2101210382,"Many of the most virulent strains of Salmonella enterica produce two distinct Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases (SodCI and SodCII). The bacteriophage-encoded SodCI enzyme makes the greater contribution to Salmonella virulence. We have performed a detailed comparison of the functional, structural, and regulatory properties of the Salmonella SodC enzymes. Here we demonstrate that SodCI and SodCII differ with regard to specific activity, protease resistance, metal affinity, and peroxidative activity, with dimeric SodCI exhibiting superior stability and activity. In particular, monomeric SodCII is unable to retain its catalytic copper ion in the absence of zinc. We have also found that SodCI and SodCII are differentially affected by oxygen, zinc availability, and the transcriptional regulator FNR. SodCII is strongly down-regulated under anaerobic conditions and dependent on the high affinity ZnuABC zinc transport system, whereas SodCI accumulation in vitro and within macrophages is FNR-dependent. We have confirmed earlier findings that SodCII accumulation in intracellular Salmonella is negligible, whereas SodCI is strongly up-regulated in macrophages. Our observations demonstrate that differences in expression, activity, and stability help to account for the unique contribution of the bacteriophage-encoded SodCI enzyme to Salmonella virulence."
https://openalex.org/W1983237784,"Failure to use glucose as carbon source results in transcriptional activation of numerous genes whose expression is otherwise repressed. HXT2 encodes a yeast high affinity glucose transporter that is only expressed under conditions of glucose limitation. We show that HXT2 is rapidly and potently induced by environmental alkalinization, and this requires both the Snf1 and the calcineurin pathways. Regulation by calcineurin is mediated by the transcription factor Crz1, which rapidly translocates to the nucleus upon high pH stress, and acts through a previously unnoticed Crz1-binding element (calcineurin-dependent response element) in the HXT2 promoter (-507 GGGGCTG -501). We demonstrate that, in addition to HXT2, many other genes required for adaptation to glucose shortage, such as HXT7, MDH2, or ALD4, transcriptionally respond to calcium and high pH signaling through binding of Crz1 to their promoters. Therefore, calcineurin-dependent transcriptional regulation appears to be a common feature for many genes encoding carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes. Remarkably, extracellular calcium allows growth of a snf1 mutant on low glucose in a calcineurin/Crz1-dependent manner, indicating that activation of calcineurin is sufficient to override a major deficiency in the glucose-repression pathway. We propose that alkalinization of the medium results in impaired glucose utilization and that activation of certain glucose-metabolizing genes by calcineurin contributes to yeast survival under this stress situation.

We propose that alkalinization of the medium results in impaired glucose utilization and that activation of certain glucose-metabolizing genes by calcineurin contributes to yeast survival under this stress situation. Glucose is the major carbon and energy source for most cells, and it is by far the preferred carbon source for the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this organism glucose uptake is the limiting step in the utilization of this sugar, and the relevance of glucose to yeast metabolism is highlighted by the unusually large number of hexose transporter genes present in its genome (see Refs. 1Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Boles E. Hollenberg C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 85-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for reviews). These proteins transport their substrates by passive, gradient-dependent, energy-independent diffusion. At least six of them (Hxt1–7) have been shown to act as glucose transporters, whereas others are considered to transport galactose (Gal2) or other hexoses (Hxt5 and Hxt8–17) (1Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wieczorke R. Krampe S. Weierstall T. Freidel K. Hollenberg C.P. Boles E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). These diverse glucose transporters exhibit different kinetic characteristics, and each of them appears particularly suited for a specific circumstance. For instance, Hxt1 is a low affinity, high capacity transporter, whereas Hxt2, Hxt6, and Hxt7 are examples of high affinity glucose transporters. Experimental evidence indicates that a strain lacking Hxt1–7 (often denominated as hxt null mutant) is unable to grow on glucose or other hexoses such as fructose or mannose (4Reifenberger E. Freidel K. Ciriacy M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Liang H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1953-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Expression of HXT2, HXT6, and HXT7 allows growth of the hxt strain on low (0.1%) glucose, whereas other transporters are unable to do so (6Reifenberger E. Boles E. Ciriacy M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This confirms the role of these genes as high affinity glucose transporters, even though the major physiological role for glucose uptake under glucose shortage conditions can be attributed to Hxt2 (2Boles E. Hollenberg C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 85-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression pattern of the different glucose transporters is clearly related to their intrinsic characteristics. For instance, HXT2 is expressed at low levels both in the absence of glucose and in the presence of high amounts of this sugar (when a high affinity transporter would not be needed), but its expression increases by 10-fold when low levels (0.1%) of glucose or fructose are available. This transcriptional regulation is physiologically relevant, and it is the result of a complex interaction (7Kaniak A. Xue Z. Macool D. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) between at least two different pathways: the Snf3/Rgt2-Rgt1 and the Snf1-Mig1 pathways (see Refs. 8Santangelo G.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 253-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar and 9Sanz P. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 2358-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar for recent reviews). It has been recently pointed out that Rgt1 function could also be modulated by activation of the Gpr1/PKA 2The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; CDRE, calcineurin-dependent response element; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; WCE, whole cell extract. 2The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; CDRE, calcineurin-dependent response element; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; WCE, whole cell extract. pathway (10Kim J.H. Johnston M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26144-26149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The HXT2 promoter contains two Rgt1 binding sites and two Mig1 binding sites (11Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5536-5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Under complete glucose deficiency, Rgt1 can bind to the HXT2 promoter, repressing HXT2 expression. On the other hand, activation of the Snf1 protein kinase under these circumstances results in release of the Mig1 repressor and induction of HXT2. The interconnection of both pathways ensures that HXT2 is expressed only when the levels of extracellular glucose are low. In fact, Snf1 represents a key player in the process of adaptation to glucose shortage, because activation of this kinase allows de-repression not only of HXT2, but also of many genes required for gluconeogenesis, as well as utilization of ethanol, lactate, and other alternative carbon sources. Consequently, an Snf1-deficient strain cannot grow on low levels of glucose (0.05%) or non-fermentable carbon sources (9Sanz P. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 2358-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12Schneper L. Duvel K. Broach J.R. Curr. Opin.

Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because it cannot express genes required for survival under these conditions. Glucose limitation is one of the many environmental challenges that yeast cells must cope with. For instance, S. cerevisiae grows better at acidic than at neutral or alkaline pH, and alkalinization of the medium, even if moderate, represents a stress situation for this yeast. Exposure of budding yeast to sudden alkalinization involves extensive gene remodeling that affects iron, copper, and phosphate homeostasis (14Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol.

Calcineurin is a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase that can be activated by a transient increase in cytosolic calcium (22Cyert M.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 647-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23Aramburu J. Rao A. Klee C.B. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 237-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the enzyme is composed of one of two possible catalytic subunits (CNA1 and CNA2) and one regulatory subunit, encoded by a single gene, CNB1. Activation of calcineurin has been recognized as being essential for survival under diverse stress conditions (24Cyert M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). One of the effects of calcineurin activation is the dephosphorylation of the transcription factor Crz1/Tcn1. Dephosphorylated Crz1 translocates to the nucleus and activates gene expression by binding to specific sequences, known as calcineurin-dependent response elements (CDREs), which have been identified in the promoters of several calcineurin-responsive genes (25Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 26Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W.

It has been proposed that activation of Crz1 accounts for most, if not all, calcineurin-dependent transcriptional remodeling (28Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31079-31088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In a recent report (19Viladevall L. Serrano R. Ruiz A. Domenech G. Giraldo J. Barcelo A. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43614-43624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we presented a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of the response of S. cerevisiae to severe alkaline pH stress and characterized the participation of the calcineurin pathway in gene expression remodeling induced by this circumstance. It was observed that a large number of genes involved in hexose transport and carbohydrate metabolism are induced after short exposure of the cells (10 min) to alkaline pH. The gene HXT2 attracted our attention for two reasons: 1) it accounted for one of the most potent responses to high pH and 2) its expression was significantly reduced in calcineurin-deficient (cnb1) mutants. The latter was a puzzling observation not only because there was no previous hint that expression of a glucose-repressed gene such as HXT2 might be regulated in a calcineurin-dependent fashion, but also because this gene had not been reported in a previous genome-wide analysis (28Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31079-31088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) as transcriptionally responsive to high extracellular calcium or sodium, conditions that are known to activate calcineurin. Therefore, we were interested in investigating the molecular basis of HXT2 induction under alkaline stress and the hypothetical role of calcineurin in this process. In this report we present evidence that, in addition to negative regulation by Rgt1 and Mig1, the HXT2 gene can integrate positive inputs mediated by the calcium/calcineurin pathway. More importantly, we show that this is a common feature for other genes encoding carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, and we propose that calcineurin represents a novel regulatory mechanism required for survival under certain conditions involving impaired glucose utilization.

Plasmid pBM2717 (32Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing the entire HXT2 promoter cloned in YEp357R, was a generous gift of S. Ozcan (University of Kentucky). The reporter plasmids pALD4-lacZ, pALD5-lacZ, and pALD6-lacZ were generated as follows. The ALD4, ALD5, and ALD6 upstream DNA regions containing -494 and +104, -817 and +32, or -493 and +39, respectively (relative to the starting ATG), were amplified by PCR with added EcoRI/HindIII restriction sites and cloned into the same sites of YEp357 (33Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Mutation of potential CDRE in the HXT2 promoter was made by sequential PCR. In a first step, the 618-bp BamHI/EcoRI fragment of the HXT2 promoter was amplified in two separate reactions by using appropriate primers to change CDRE1 (-513 GAGGCGT -519), CDRE2 (-501 GGGGCTG -507), or CDRE3 (-350 GTGGCTC -344) to a XbaI recognition site (TCTAGA). In the second step the entire BamHI/EcoRI fragment was amplified and digested, and the product was cloned into the same sites in the YEp357R plasmid (33Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). To generate the pCDRE2 plasmid, which contains the potential CDRE2 of the HXT2 promoter (nucleotide -514 to -495), the single-stranded oligonucleotides 5′_CDRE2_HXT2 and 3′_CDRE2_HXT2 were hybridized by heating the mixture at 94 °C for 5 min and then allowing to cool at room temperature for ∼15 min to yield a double-stranded molecule bearing the artificial restriction sites KpnI and XhoI. After phosphorylation with T4 polynucleotide kinase, the DNA fragment was inserted into the KpnI and XhoI restriction sites of the pSLFΔ-178K plasmid (34Idrissi F.Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Pina B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The plasmids pCDRE2mut and pCDRE3 were constructed exactly as pCDRE2 except that the pairs of oligonucleotides 5′_CDRE2mut_HXT2 and 3′_CDRE2mut_HXT2, and 5′_CDRE3_HXT2 and 3′_CDRE3_HXT2 were employed, respectively. The mutation introduced in CDRE2 was the same as in the YEp357R-derived vector. All constructions were verified by sequencing using the BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). β-Galactosidase Activity Assay—Yeast cells were grown to saturation in the appropriate dropout media and then inoculated into YP plus 4% glucose (YPD 4% glucose). Growth was resumed until A660 0.5–0.7, and cultures were centrifuged for 5 min at 1620 × g. Cells were resuspended in YPD 4% glucose (no induction), YPD 4% glucose plus 50 mm TAPS adjusted to pH 8.0 (alkaline stress), YPD 0.05% glucose (low glucose), or YPD 4% glucose plus 0.2 m CaCl2 (calcium treatment), and growth was resumed for 60 min. When chemical blocking of calcineurin was desired, 1.5 μg/ml FK506 (generously provided by Astellas Pharma) was added to the resuspension medium. In all cases, β-galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (35Reynolds A. Lundblad V. Dorris D. Keaveney M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, NY1997: 13.6.1-13.6.6Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization of Crz1—Wild-type DBY746 cells were transformed with the pLMB127 plasmid (a generous gift of M. Cyert, University of Stanford), which contains three tandem copies of GFP fused to the N terminus of Crz1 (36Boustany L.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 608-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells were grown (A660 of 0.9–1.0) on synthetic medium containing 4% glucose as the carbon source and in the absence of methionine to induce expression from the MET25 promoter present in the pLMB127 vector. Ammonium chloride was substituted for ammonium sulfate to reduce precipitation upon Ca2+ addition. Cultures (5 ml) were treated as follows: addition of 100 μl of 1 m KCl (control cells), addition of 100 μl of 1 m KOH (alkaline stress, pH 8.2), addition of 500 μl of 2 m CaCl2 (calcium treatment), or resuspension in 5 ml of the same medium containing 0.05% glucose (low glucose). Samples (250 μl) were taken at the appropriate times and fixed for 5 min by adding 13.5 μl of 37% formaldehyde. Cells were harvested, washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and finally concentrated 10-fold before visualization. Cells were visualized with a fluorescein filter using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope. Digital images were captured with an ORCA-ER 4742-80 camera (Hamamatsu) and Wasabi software. Computational Search for Putative CDRE in pH-induced, Glucose-repressed Genes—The combined list of 788 genes induced at least 2-fold by exposure to pH 8.0 (19Viladevall L. Serrano R. Ruiz A.

Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39785-39795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was analyzed for genes induced by nutrient scarcity: low glucose (37Ferea T.L. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Rosenzweig R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9721-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) or diauxic shift (38DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar). The resulting list of 107 genes was searched for putative CDRE with a position-specific scoring matrix using the PATSER (version 3d) software available at the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools site (39van Helden J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3593-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The parameters defined were: 800 upstream nucleotides (allowing overlapping with open reading frame) and a weight matrix based on the G(A/T)GGCTG sequence. Minimum score threshold was set to 6.0 (minimum score: -12.159, maximum score: 7.991). A control search was conducted using the same search parameters on 300 S. cerevisiae genes randomly selected by the system. RNA Preparation and RT-PCR—For RNA preparation, yeast cells were grown on YPD to an optical density of 0.5–0.8 and split into aliquots. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended either in fresh YPD (non-stressed cells, pH 6.2) or YPD containing 50 mm TAPS (stressed cells, pH 8.0) for 10–30 min. When inhibition of calcineurin was desired, FK506 (final concentration of 1.5 μg/ml) was added to the medium 1 h prior initiation of the alkaline treatment. Cultures were then centrifuged for 2 min at 1620 × g at 4 °C, and total RNA was extracted by using hot phenol and glass beads as described previously (40Köhrer K. Dombey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) or the RiboPure-Yeast kit (Ambion). RNA quality was assessed by denaturing 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, and RNA quantification was performed by measuring A260 in a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf). RT-PCRs were performed using 200 ng of total RNA and the Ready-To-Go RT-PCR Beads kit (GE-Amersham Biosciences) for 25–30 cycles. Specific pairs of oligonucleotides (supplemental Table S2) were used to determine mRNA levels for HXT2, HXT7, GSY2, CIT2, HXK1, TPS1, MDH1, ALD4, and PHO89. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin cross-linking and immunoprecipitation were performed as previously described (20Platara M. Ruiz A. Serrano R. Palomino A. Moreno F. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36632-36642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Expression of N-terminally HA-tagged Crz1 was accomplished by transformation of strain EDN92 (crz1) with the centromeric plasmid pAMS451 (pRS315-HA-CRZ1) (25Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50-ml cultures were grown up to A660 1.0 on YPD medium, and cells were exposed to alkaline stress (pH 8.0) or high calcium (CaCl2, 0.2 m) for 10 min as described for β-galactosidase activity assays. Then, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 1 h at 24 °C and quenched by addition of 100 mm glycine for 15 min at 24 °C. Cells were collected and washed four times with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, resuspended in 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and lysed with glass beads. The resulting extracts were sonicated to obtain chromatin fragments of 500–800 bp, centrifuged at 9300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C (whole cell extracts (WCEs)). For chromatin immunoprecipitation, 100 μl of Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was coupled to 5 μg of a monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science). The anti-HA-Protein G-Sepharose complexes were incubated overnight with 200 μl of WCE at 4 °C. Sepharose-protein complexes were transferred to 96-well filter plates (MultiScr"

More recently, it has been shown to be localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it functions in a signaling pathway required for cell migration and polarization. Herein, we demonstrate that SOK1 regulates cell death after chemical anoxia, as its down-regulation by RNA interference enhances cell survival. Furthermore, expression of SOK1 elicits apoptotic cell death by activating the intrinsic pathway. We also find that a cleaved form of SOK1 translocates from the Golgi to the nucleus after chemical anoxia and that this translocation is dependent on both caspase activity and on amino acids 275-292, located immediately C-terminal to the SOK1 kinase domain. Furthermore, SOK1 entry into the nucleus is important for the cell death response since SOK1 mutants unable to enter the nucleus do not induce cell death. In summary, SOK1 is necessary to induce cell death and can induce death when overexpressed. Furthermore, SOK1 appears to play distinctly different roles in stressed versus non-stressed cells, regulating cell death in the former.

Cells react to elevated levels of ROS in various ways depending on the status of the cell itself and the severity of the insult. In general, cells can either activate mechanisms that minimize the damage induced by ROS or undergo programmed cell death or necrotic cell death if the damage is too severe to be repaired. A large number of molecules have been implicated in the stress response to ROS (4Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar), but much remains unknown, particularly about the proximal effectors regulating the cell response to this type of stress. The Ste20 proteins were first described in yeast as the upstream components of signal transduction pathways (5Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 6Friesen H. Lunz R. Doyle S. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2162-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In mammals, more than 30 members have been described to date, and they fall into two families (7Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), the p21-activated protein kinase family and the germinal center kinase (GCK) family. Based on phylogenetic analysis, Dan et al. (8Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) further classified these two families into two distinct subfamilies for the p21-activated protein kinases and eight subfamilies for the GCKs These proteins are implicated in a wide range of biological responses such as regulation of cell proliferation, cell death, and cytoskeleton rearrangements in response to either extracellular stimuli or various forms of cellular stress. Some family members activate known mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (9Lin J.L. Chen H.C. Fang H.I. Robinson D. Kung H.J. Shih H.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6559-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), whereas for others uncertainty remains as to whether they activate these core signal transduction modules (11Schinkmann K. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28695-28703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Zhou T.H. Ling K. Guo J. Zhou H. Wu Y.L. Jing Q. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The proteins belonging to the GCK-II and -III subfamilies are closely related and have recently been dubbed mammalian sterile twenty-like (MST) kinases. The Mst1 and Mst2 proteins belong to the GCK-II subfamily, whereas SOK1/YSK1, Mst3, and Mst4 belong to the GCK-III subfamily (8Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 13Pombo C.M. Force T. Kyriakis J. Nogueira E. Fidalgo M. Zalvide J. Front.

Mann M. Pandey A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5929-5939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that these proteins are cleaved by caspases in response to certain types of stress. Mst1 and Mst3 have known nuclear localization signals (NLS) and nuclear export signals (14Ura S. Masuyama N. Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10148-10153Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Lee K.K. Yonehara S. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After caspase cleavage, the nuclear export signal is separated from the rest of the kinase, which can then enter the nucleus driven by its NLS. Further levels of regulation have been reported for Mst1 and 2 that control their apoptotic potential (20Praskova M. Khoklatchev A. Ortiz-Vega S. Avruch J. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 21Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Physiological substrates and effectors for these kinases have only recently been reported, but a wide variety of them have been proposed in the last years. For instance, Mst1 has been shown to phosphorylate histone H2B, and this correlates with chromatin condensation seen in apoptotic cells, suggesting a possible explanation of how this protein is involved in cell death. More recently, another substrate of Mst1 has been identified. Upon oxidative stress in mammalian neurons, Mst1 phosphorylates the FOXO3 transcription factor, which translocates to the nucleus to play a role in oxidative stress-induced cell death (22Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de l.I. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The finding that Mst1/2 and Mst3 phosphorylate the serine/threonine kinases Lats1 and NDR, respectively, places these proteins in yet another signal transduction pathway (23Chan E.H. Nousiainen M. Chalamalasetty R.B. Schafer A. Nigg E.A. Sillje H.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2076-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 24Stegert M.R. Hergovich A. Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J. Hemmings B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11019-11029Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of this pathway remains poorly understood in mammals, interestingly, the orthologs in Drosophila (Hippo and Warts) have been shown to coordinate both cell division and cell death (25Jia J. Zhang W. Wang B. Trinko R. Jiang J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2514-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 26Wu S. Huang J. Dong J. Pan D.

Further suggesting that these proteins are implicated in apoptotic cell death is the fact that they are activated by stress stimuli and, for Mst1, by the Fas death-inducing receptor (10Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The GCK-III subfamily member SOK1 is activated by oxidative stress as its name implies (Ste-20 oxidant stress response kinase 1) (30Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Pombo C.M. Tsujita T. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Force T. J. Biol.

Izawa M. Saito R. Mizuno K. Suzuki A. Hirai S. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently SOK1 has been reported to play a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements as its activity is necessary to redirect the Golgi apparatus toward the leading edge of the migrating cell (33Preisinger C. Short B. De C.V. Bruyneel E. Haas A. Kopajtich R. Gettemans J. Barr F.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1009-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, although the role of SOK1 in regulating specific functions in non-stressed cells is beginning to be understood, what role, if any, the marked activation of this kinase by extreme stress might play in cell response to these stresses is not known. Herein, we demonstrate that SOK1 drives the apoptotic response to ROS and chemical anoxia, a model of ischemia characterized by marked ROS production and severe ATP depletion. Under these conditions SOK1 dissociates from the Golgi and translocates to the nucleus, a process that depends on caspase activation and on the integrity of amino acids 275-292. Thus, SOK1 has distinctly different functions depending on the redox status and energy status of the cell, regulating cell motility in the non-stressed cell via effects at the Golgi and regulating cell death in the stressed cell via effects in the nucleus.

The oligonucleotides designed for the different mutants were purchased from Sigma Aldrich or Thermo, and their sequence is available on request. The plasmid encoding the small hairpin RNA (shRNA) for SOK1 was constructed ligating a double-stranded oligonucleotide (sequence available on request) to the pSUPER plasmid (34Brummelkamp T.R.

The control virus expresses LacZ and GFP from the two promoters. Viruses were propagated in HEK293 cells. Cell Culture and Treatments—HeLa, HEK293, SaOS2, and COS-7 cells were cultured under standard conditions. For experiments with caspase inhibitors, cells were cultured in the presence of 50 μm z-VAD-fmk or 50 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO. For chemical anoxia, cells were treated with sodium cyanide (5 mm) and 2-deoxyglucose (5 mm) in KRH medium (115 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 1.3 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2). Treatment with H2O2 was at a concentration of 500 μm at the times specified in each individual experiment. Transfections and Infections—HEK293 and SaOS2 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate protocol. COS7 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran technique as described (35Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Infection with adenovirus in HeLa cells was performed with standard protocols. To ensure moderate levels of expression of the proteins, the multiplicity of infection was 1. Determination of Cell Viability—Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Dead cells (blue) are expressed as a percent of total cells. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. For SOK1 or M2 detection, cells were lysed in SAPK buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 10 units/ml Trasylol) (36Pombo C.M.

Cell extracts were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and proteins were analyzed by Western blot on nitrocellulose membrane. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (TROPIX, Applied Biosystems). Cytochrome c Release—Detection of cytochrome c release was performed as described (37Hatai T. Matsuzawa A. Inoshita S. Mochida Y. Kuroda T. Sakamaki K. Kuida K. Yonehara S. Ichijo H. Takeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26576-26581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Determination of Lactate Dehydrogenase Release—Cell cytotoxicity was measured according to the manufacturer instructions (cytotoxicity detection kit, Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, HEK293 cells transfected either with sh-luci or sh-SOK1 were preincubated for 12 h in assay medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 1% fetal bovine serum). Cells were then left untreated or treated with 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm sodium cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose or 1 μm staurosporine, respectively. After 6 h of treatment, 100 μl of supernatant of each well were removed and transferred into an optically clear 96-well flat-bottom microplate. Then, 100 μl of reaction mixture was added to each well and incubated for up to 30 min at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl/well of 1 n HCl. Lactate dehydrogenase release was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 455 nm, with 595 nm as the reference wavelength. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from HeLa cells essentially as described (38Robb G.B. Brown K.M. Khurana J. Rana T.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) using NaCl to a final concentration 300 mm to extract nuclear proteins. Kinase Assays—Extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-M2 tag monoclonal antibody or anti-SOK1 antibody, and kinase assays were performed as described (30Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—HEK293 cells were fixed in 50% methanol, 50% acetone and treated with the appropriate antibodies under standard conditions. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 μm). The coverslips were mounted in aqueous medium with anti-fading agents (Gel/Mount). Microscopy—The expression of GFPSOK1 and its mutants in living cells was monitored using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70) with a 60×/0.65 objective. Bright field visualization was performed in the same microscope using a Hoffman modulation contrast system. Immunofluorescence of endogenous SOK1 was visualized using a Leica AF6000 series microscope equipped with an HCX PL APO 63× objective with a NA of 1.40. Photoimages were acquired using an Olympus DP50 digital camera. Adobe Photoshop software was used to cut, resize, and mount the photographs in the figures. In Vitro Translation and Caspase Cleavage—Mst3 and Sok1 were translated in vitro using a coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) in the presence of l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). After translation they were incubated for 2 h al 37 °C with 200 ng of caspase 3 (BD Biosciences) in the presence or absence of 1 μm z-VAD-fmk. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE before drying and autoradiography. Statistical Analysis—A non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was done to perform a statistical analysis of the data. SOK1 Induces Apoptotic Cell Death—SOK1 is activated by ROS and chemical anoxia. However, the effects of SOK1 on the biology of the cell are not known. As a first approach toward understanding the cellular responses elicited by SOK1, we studied the effect of enforced expression of the protein. We transfected either HEK293, SaOS2, or COS-7 cells with full-length SOK1 or infected HeLa cells with recombinant adenoviruses encoding GFP and SOK1 in independent ORFs (Ad-SOK1). In all four cell types, overexpression of SOK1 induced cell death as measured by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 1A). These results are consistent with a role for SOK1 in cell death in a variety of cell types. Fig. 1A also shows that the degree of cell death in each cell line was different, which correlated with the expression levels of the overexpressed protein in the different cell types (data not shown). To verify a correlation between the level of SOK1 and the degree of cell death, we transfected increasing amounts of full-length SOK1 in HEK293 cells and assessed the number of non-viable cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, the percentage of non-viable cells is higher as the level of the overexpressed SOK1 increases, confirming that the level of SOK1 protein correlates with its capacity to induce cell death. To determine the type of cell death induced by SOK1, we examined the morphological and biochemical features of SOK1-overexpressing cells. Cells successfully transduced with Ad-SOK1, which are readily identified by co-expression of GFP, demonstrated condensed chromatin as determined by Hoechst 33342 staining (Fig. 1C, middle panel) and also show membrane blebbing and shrinkage when observed in bright field (right panel). These characteristics are hallmarks of apoptotic cell death and were not observed in cells transfected with control Ad-GFP (data not shown). These data suggest that SOK1 induces an apoptotic form of cell death. At the molecular level one of the hallmarks of apoptosis is release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytoplasm, triggering activation of the intrinsic cell death pathway. We determined whether cytochrome c is released in response to expression of SOK1. In HEK293 cells, expression of SOK1 increased the amount of cytoplasmic cytochrome c (Fig. 1D) to the same magnitude as treatment with H2O2. To further test if SOK1 induces an apoptotic type of cell death, we examined whether caspase activity was required for SOK1-induced death using z-VAD-fmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, in SOK1-transfected HEK293 cells. When cell death was measured by trypan blue exclusion assay, the ability of SOK1 to induce cell death was significantly reduced by z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1E). A different caspase inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, had similar effects (Fig. 1E). This indicates that a significant fraction of SOK1-induced cell death is caspase-dependent. Consistent with this, PARP, which is a biological substrate of caspases, is cleaved in Ad-SOK1-infected cells (Fig. 1F), confirming that caspases are activated in the course of SOK1-induced death. In summary, expression of SOK1 induces cell death with apoptotic features and is dependent at least in part on activation of caspases. SOK1 Mediates Cell Death Induced by Different Stress Insults—To confirm a role for SOK1 in cell death, we down-regulated SOK1 levels by RNA interference. Specifically, we silenced SOK1 using a shRNA expressed from the pSUPER vector. As a control we transfected cells with a shRNA directed against firefly luciferase. Five days after transfection of HEK293 cells with SOK1 shRNA, the levels of SOK1 were less than 50% that of those in cells transfected with control shRNA (Fig. 2A). In untreated cells knockdown of SOK1 had no effect on cell viability, but when chemical anoxia was induced in these cells with sodium cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose (CN+DOG), cell death was significantly reduced in cells treated with SOK1 shRNA (Fig. 2B). Despite the extreme stress of prolonged chemical anoxia, knockdown of SOK-1 protected cells for up to 24 h. To demonstrate the specificity of the SOK1 shRNA, we performed a rescue experiment. We generated a mutated form of SOK1 (SOK1-R) that has the same amino acid sequence as SOK1 but is resistant to sh-SOK1 (Fig. 2C). SOK1-R, but not SOK1, significantly reduced the ability of SOK1 shRNA to protect cells from chemical anoxia-induced cell death (Fig. 2D). Thus, SOK1 shRNA inhibits chemical anoxia-induced cell death via specific knockdown of SOK1 rather than off-target effects of the shRNA construct. The role of SOK1 in cell death is not restricted to that induced by chemical anoxia. Death induced by osmotic stress was clearly diminished in cells transfected with sh-SOK1 (supplemental Fig. S1). This correlates with the delayed activation of SOK1 (2-6 h) after osmotic stress. Osmotic stress has been shown to induce reactive oxygen species (39Kultz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 225-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), and this provides a possible mechanism for activation of SOK1 in this situation. The above results indicate that, besides being able to induce cell death upon overexpression, endogenous SOK1 plays a significant role in cell death induced by at least two different forms of extreme cellular stress. Enforced expression of SOK1 induces an apoptotic form of cell death, but the knockdown of SOK1 protects cells from types of insults that can cause either necrotic or apoptotic cell death (40Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects of silencing SOK1 protects the cells from one or both death mechanisms, we quantified the magnitude of necrosis elicited by chemical anoxia in cells that either express normal levels of SOK1 or in which the levels of the protein were knocked-down. In our cellular system chemical anoxia resulted in a very modest induction of necrosis, as judged by lactate dehydrogenase release by injured cells (Fig. 2F), and SOK1 down-regulation had no effect on this. In contrast, chemical anoxia resulted in cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (Fig. 2E). This together with the absence of plasma membrane injury under the treatment suggests that at least part of the cell death induced by this stress is through an apoptotic mechanism. Significantly, the release of cytochrome c in response to chemical anoxia is clearly diminished in cells transfected with the SOK1 shRNA (Fig. 2E), showing that SOK1 has a role in this induction. SOK1 Enters the Nucleus in Response to Cellular Stress—Preisinger et al. (33Preisinger C. Short B. De C.V. Bruyneel E. Haas A. Kopajtich R. Gettemans J. Barr F.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1009-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) recently reported that SOK1 localizes to the Golgi apparatus and is required for cells to reorientate the Golgi toward the direction of forward movement. To reconcile this observation with ours (i.e. that SOK1 induces cell death), we hypothesized that SOK1 may have dual roles depending on the cellular status. We first asked whether this might be reflected in its intracellular location, as described for other Mst kinases. To address this issue we performed immunofluorescent staining of endogenous SOK1 in control cells and upon induction of chemical anoxia. As shown in Fig. 3, SOK1 localizes preferentially to the Golgi apparatus in control cells, as its staining aligns with Golgi-58K, a protein known to localize at the Golgi. In contrast, SOK1 becomes uniformly distributed throughout the cell (pancellular), including in the nucleus, after 6 h of treatment. Interestingly, Golgi-58Kalsobecomes delocalized, possibly reflecting the disassembly of the Golgi upon extreme stresses. However, in contrast to SOK1, Golgi-58K is still located mainly in the cytoplasm. Even GAPDH, a protein that has been shown to translocate to the nucleus in many forms of apoptotic cell death (41Chuang D.M. Hough C. Senatorov V.V. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), remains in the cytoplasm after CN/2DOG at a time when SOK1 is pancellular and enters the nucleus (supplemental Fig. S2). This suggests that stress-induced nuclear entry of SOK1 is not due to a generalized breakdown of nuclear membrane integrity but is characteristic of this protein and may be important for its biology. To study the mechanisms regulating entry of SOK1 into the nucleus, we evaluated the cellular localization of different mutants of the protein (Fig. 4A). We constructed fusion proteins of several mutants of SOK1 with GFP and visualized their cellula"

Upon stimulation with agonists that induce Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, peroxisomes transiently take up Ca2+ reaching peak values in the lumen as high as 50–100 μm, depending on cell types. Also in resting cells, peroxisomes sustain a Ca2+ gradient, [Ca2+]perox being ∼20-fold higher than [Ca2+] in the cytosol ([Ca2+]cyt). The properties of Ca2+ traffic across the peroxisomal membrane are different from those reported for other subcellular organelles. The sensitivity of peroxisomal Ca2+ uptake to agents dissipating H+ and Na+ gradients unravels the existence of a complex bioenergetic framework including V-ATPase, Ca2+/H+, and Ca2+/Na+ activities whose components are yet to be identified at a molecular level.

The different [Ca2+]perox of resting and stimulated cells suggest that Ca2+ could play an important role in the regulation of peroxisomal metabolism. Peroxisomes are quasi-ubiquitous organelles of eukaryotic cells that are involved in several metabolic pathways. They play an essential role in fatty acid α- and β-oxidation, in the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids and bile acids, in the catabolism of purines and polyamines and in the degradation of hydrogen peroxides, prostaglandins, glyoxylate, and l-pipecolic acid (1Wanders R.J. Waterham H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 295-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Impairment of peroxisomal activities causes “peroxisomal disorders,” most of which are associated with severe neurological symptoms as in the Zellweger spectrum (1Wanders R.J. Waterham H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 295-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 2Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 3Wanders R.J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 126: 355-375Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Structurally, peroxisomes consist of a proteinaceous milieu limited by a single lipid bilayer originally thought to be freely permeable to small solutes. In contrast, recent reports demonstrated the existence of peroxisomal membrane transporters in both yeast and mammalian cells (4Palmieri L. Rottensteiner H. Girzalsky W. Scarcia P. Palmieri F.

J. 2007; 401: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a strictly regulated activity of peroxisomal pathways acting in concert with cytosolic metabolism. In addition, the hypothesis of peroxisomes playing a direct role in intracellular signaling was supported (9Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but no information until now is available on how extracellular agonists could have regulatory effects on peroxisomal biochemical pathways via their second messengers. In this context, we investigated for the first time the properties of peroxisomes in handling Ca2+, one of the most ubiquitous cellular second messengers. In this work we provide direct evidence that peroxisomes play a role in Ca2+ homeostasis by using the targeted recombinant aequorin approach that has been previously applied to other subcellular compartments such as mitochondria (10Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), nucleus (11Brini M. Murgia M. Pasti L. Picard D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R.

We generated two novel peroxisomally targeted aequorins, peroxAEQwt and peroxAEQmut, suitable for dynamic monitoring of Ca2+ in intact cells over a wide range of concentrations. We found that a large transient Ca2+ uptake occurs in peroxisomes of cells stimulated with extracellular agonists. Furthermore, in steady state conditions, Ca2+ in peroxisomal lumen is maintained at concentrations ∼20-fold higher than in cytosol. The sensitivity of peroxisomal Ca2+ transport to a set of different ionophore reagents unravels the existence of an unexpectedly complex bioenergetic framework across the peroxisomal membrane, whereby a H+ gradient (in resting state) and H+ and Na+ gradients (in stimulated cells) sustain Ca2+ uptake into the peroxisomal lumen. Our work provides clear evidence that peroxisomes are involved in Ca2+ homeostasis, thus adding further complexity to the intracellular network of Ca2+ signaling. The dynamic flux of Ca2+ ions across the peroxisomal membrane presented herein has unique characteristics when compared with previously investigated subcellular compartments, suggesting the existence of yet unidentified peroxisomal membrane transporting systems as well as the potential for Ca2+ to play a role in the regulation of peroxisomal metabolism. Construction of peroxAEQs and pHluorin cDNAs—Peroxisome-targeted wild-type and mutant aequorins (peroxAEQwt and peroxAEQmut) were generated by appending the PTS1 signal to their C termini. For the amplification of both aequorin variants, oligonucleotides 5′-CAT AAG CTT ATG TAT GAT GTT CCT GAT TAT-3′ and 5′-TAA GAA TTC TTA TAA TTT GGA GGG GAC AGC TCC ACC GTA-3′ were used as forward and reverse primers to insert the PTS1 sequence downstream the HindIII-EcoRI fragments encoding the HA1-tagged aequorin (15Brini M.

The cDNAs encoding the cytosolic and peroxisomal variants of the ratiometric pH-sensitive pHluorin (16Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E.

Escherichia coli DH5α strain was used for all plasmid amplifications and isolations. The sequences of the inserts were verified.FIGURE 6Peroxisomes accumulate Ca2+ during the resting state. CHO cells expressing peroxAEQwt (A and C) or peroxAEQmut (B) were depleted of Ca2+ by incubation with 5 μm ionomycin in KRB supplemented with 0.6 mm EGTA. Then aequorins were reconstituted in the same medium with 5 μm coelenterazine for 1–2 h at 4 °C. At the luminometer, after extensive washing with KRB in the presence of 2% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm EGTA, the cells were initially perfused with KRB supplemented with 0.1 mm EGTA and then with KRB/Ca2+. Where shown, after Ca2+ refilling, the cells were challenged with 100 μm ATP. The data are representative of at least 15 separate experiments, which yielded the same results. In these experiments, the EGTA plus ionomycin treatment, at 4 °C as well as at 37 °C, did not induce visible alterations in the shape or in the number of peroxisomes in comparison with nontreated cells, as demonstrated in fluorescence microscopy by imaging living CHO cells expressing peroxi-DsRed2 as a fluorescent peroxisomal marker (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 1Schematic map of peroxAEQwt and peroxAEQmut and subcellular localization of peroxAEQwt.A, the two peroxisomal aequorin chimeras were generated by adding the PTS1 sequence downstream from the cDNAs encoding the HA1-tagged wild-type and mutant aequorins.

Twenty-four hours before transfection, the cells were seeded onto 13-mm (for aequorin measurements), 24-mm (for immunofluorescence) or 40-mm (for pHluorin measurements) glass coverslips and allowed to attain 40–60% confluence. Transfection was carried out with 4, 8, or 12 μg of total plasmid DNA for 13-, 24-, or 40-mm coverslips, respectively, according to a standard calcium-phosphate procedure (17Pinton P. Rimessi A. Romagnoli A. Prandini A. Rizzuto R. Methods Cell Biol. 2007; 80: 297-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the experiments were performed 36–48 h after transfection. Immunolocalization of the Peroxisomal HA1-tagged Recombinant Aequorins—For the immunofluorescence experiments, CHO cells were co-transfected with 4 μg of pcDNA3-peroxAEQwt or pcDNA3-peroxAEQmut and 4 μg of peroxi-DsRed2 plasmid (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) containing the coding sequence of the red fluorescent DsRed protein having a type-2 PTS signal (1Wanders R.J. Waterham H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 295-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) for its specific expression in the peroxisomes. Thirty-six to 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed in the presence of formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, as previously described (13Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a wet chamber with a 1:250 dilution (in phosphate-buffered saline) of the HA.11 monoclonal antibody, clone 16B12 (Covance, Princeton, NJ) raised against the HA1 epitope. Immunostaining of the cells was performed with the green fluorescent AlexaFluor 488 anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Wide field fluorescences were acquired through a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). The images were analyzed using the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downington, PA) and processed with the AutoDeblur 2D deconvolution software (AutoQuant Imaging, Inc., Watervliet, NY). pH Measurements with Expressed pHluorins—The cells were seeded on 40-mm coverslips and transfected after 24 h with 12 μg of pcDNA3-cyt-pHluorin or pcDNA3-peroxi-pHluorin. Thirty-six to 48 h after transfection coverslips were mounted in a thermostatted Bioptechs FCS2 closed chamber (Bioptechs, Inc., Butler, PA). The cells were perfused with Krebs-Ringer modified buffer supplemented with Ca2+ (KRB/Ca2+: 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), challenged, where indicated, with 100 μm ATP, and then perfused with KRB/Ca2+ solutions buffered at different pHs (pH 6.5–7.75) in the presence of 10 μm monensin and 1 μm FCCP to titrate the pH-sensitive fluorescence of both pHluorins. Fluorescence images were acquired, as previously described (5Lasorsa F.M. Scarcia P. Erdmann R. Palmieri F. Rottensteiner H. Palmieri L. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), through a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a Photometrics Cascade 512B CCD camera (Roper Scientific) and analyzed using the Metafluor software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downington, PA). Aequorin Reconstitution and Luminescence Measurements—Recombinant aequorins were reconstituted by incubating transfected cells with 5 μm coelenterazine (for cytAEQwt (15Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), mitAEQmut (18Lasorsa F.M. Pinton P. Palmieri L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38686-38692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), peroxAEQwt and peroxAEQmut), or 5 μm coelenterazine n (for erAEQmut (12Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar)) in KRB/Ca2+, pH 7.4, in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 2–3 h. When a reduction of the intracellular Ca2+ content was necessary, aequorin reconstitutions were performed by incubating the cells for 1–2 h at 4 °C in KRB in the absence of Ca2+ and in the presence of 5 μm coelenterazine, 5 μm ionomycin, as a Ca2+ ionophore, and 0.6 mm EGTA. After this treatment, the cells were extensively washed with KRB supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm EGTA (13Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the cells were permeabilized with 20 μm digitonin for 1 min (19Aboushadi N. Krisans S.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1781-1791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently perfused with “intracellular buffer” supplemented with 0.1 mm EGTA (IB/EGTA: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm succinate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.05) at 37 °C. The Ca2+-dependent luminescence of aequorin was measured by perfusing the cells with KRB/Ca2+ supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose and stimulating them with 100 μm ATP (CHO, HepG2, COS-7, and HEK293) or 100 μm histamine (HeLa cells). In permeabilized cells, [Ca2+] measurements were carried out perfusing the cells in IB without EGTA, i.e. ∼5 μm free Ca2+ (13Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and activating with 5 μm IP3. All of the experiments were terminated by lysing the cells with 100 μm digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2+-rich solution (10 mm CaCl2 in H2O), thus discharging the remaining aequorin pool. The light signal was collected in a purpose-built luminometer and calibrated into [Ca2+] values as previously described (20Chiesa A. Rapizzi E. Tosello V. Pinton P. de Virgilio M. Fogarty K.E. Rizzuto R. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). When Ca2+ sensitivity of peroxAEQs luminescence was studied, CHO cells expressing peroxAEQwt or peroxAEQmut were lysed by freezing/thawing cycles at -80 °C, and the probes were reconstituted with 5 μm coelenterazine. Lysed cells were then collected into a PerkinElmer MicroBeta Jet luminometer, and Ca2+ sensitivity of the probes was measured as previously described (12Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) by relating the rate of the luminescence emitted in the presence of EGTA-buffered Ca2+ solutions (L) to that emitted after complete consumption of the probes with excess of Ca2+ (Lmax). Subcellular Targeting and Validation of Peroxisomal Aequorins—Peroxisomal variants of the hemagglutinin (HA1)-tagged wild-type (15Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and D119A mutant (12Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) aequorins were generated by appending the PTS1 signal (1Wanders R.J. Waterham H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 295-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) to their C termini (Fig. 1A). The two different aequorin chimeras, designated as peroxAEQwt and peroxAEQmut, were expressed in mammalian cells, and their peroxisomal localization was confirmed by immunocytochemical experiments. The fluorescence of immunostained cells expressing peroxAEQwt (Fig. 1B, panel i) or peroxAEQmut (not shown) extensively overlapped with that of the co-expressed recombinant peroxisomal marker peroxi-DsRed2 (Fig. 1B, panel ii), whereas no significant overlay was imaged when cells co-expressed mitochondrial or ER fluorescent recombinant proteins (21Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar) (not shown). As previously reported (22Alvarez J. Montero M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the addition of targeting motifs to the C terminus of aequorin could modify its stability as well as its Ca2+-dependent luminescence emission. Accordingly, the light emission from lysates of CHO cells expressing the peroxAEQs was measured upon reconstitution of the probes in the presence of various Ca2+-buffered solutions at neutral pH. The emitted luminescence of peroxisomal probes at free [Ca2+] ranging between 10-9 and 10-2m (L) was related to the total luminescence emitted in the presence of saturating [Ca2+] (Lmax), and the calculated L/Lmax values were actually similar to the output of lysates of cells expressing the cytosolic wild-type (cytAEQwt) or the mitochondrial mutant aequorin (mitAEQmut) used in the same experimental conditions as already calibrated reference probes (11Brini M. Murgia M. Pasti L. Picard D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4813-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 23Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In addition, because Ca2+ sensitivity of aequorins depends on the pH of the surrounding medium, we determined the pH of the peroxisomal lumen using a peroxisomally targeted variant of the pH-sensitive protein pHluorin (16Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar) (peroxi-pHluorin). When compared with a cytosolic pHluorin, the measured peroxisomal and cytosolic pH values showed minor differences that do not significantly affect aequorin Ca2+ sensitivity (CHO cells, 6.92 ± 0.15, n = 25 in peroxisomes versus 7.08 ± 0.11, n = 25 in cytosol; HeLa cells, 7.09 ± 0.25, n = 15 in peroxisomes versus 7.23 ± 0.09, n = 15 in cytosol). In view of these data, the Ca2+ response for peroxAEQs was therefore assumed to be equivalent to that of the cytosolic and mitochondrial variants. Peroxisomes Transiently Accumulate Ca2+upon Agonist Stimulation—Evidence for a possible role of peroxisomes in cellular Ca2+ signaling was obtained when peroxAEQmut was transiently expressed in mammalian cells, and its Ca2+-dependent luminescence was measured in the presence of agonists that elicit the IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (24Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). Upon cell stimulation, a rapid transient Ca2+ influx occurred in peroxisomes (Fig. 2A), parallel to the [Ca2+] increases recorded in mitochondria and cytosol (Fig. 2, B and C). The kinetics of the peroxisomal [Ca2+] changes were similar to those already described for mitochondria (23Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Table 1 for several stimulated cell lines, the measured agonist-induced peroxisomal [Ca2+] peak values ([Ca2+]perox) varied from ∼50 to ∼100 μm, and they were significantly and reproducibly higher than those measured in mitochondria and were unaffected by ruthenium red (Fig. 2D), a well known inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (23Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Therefore, peroxisomes transiently reach a higher [Ca2+] than mitochondria, peaking as rapidly as mitochondria although through a different molecular route.TABLE 1Agonist-induced [Ca2+] peak values measured in cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes of different cell lines All of the indicated cells were transfected in parallel with VR1012/cytAEQwt, VR1012/mitAEQmut, and pcDNA3/peroxAEQmut plasmids, which respectively encode cytosolic, mitochondrial, and peroxisomal aequorin chimeras. The recombinant probes were reconstituted after 36 h with 5 μm coelenterazine in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 2 h in KRB/Ca2+ medium plus 5.5 mm glucose. At the luminometer, the cells were perfused in the same medium and stimulated with 100 μm ATP, except the HeLa cells, which were triggered with 100 μm histamine. The data represent the maximum of [Ca2+] peaks measured upon agonist stimulation.Cells[Ca2+]cyt[Ca2+]mit[Ca2+]peroxmmmmmmHeLa1.2 ± 0.2 (n = 15)42 ± 6 (n = 15)69 ± 7 (n = 15)CHO2.2 ± 0.3 (n = 15)63 ± 6 (n = 15)107 ± 9 (n = 15)HEK2930.8 ± 0.2 (n = 15)39 ± 4 (n = 15)58 ± 8 (n = 15)COS-70.9 ± 0.2 (n = 15)26 ± 7 (n = 15)55 ± 5 (n = 15)HepG20.9 ± 0.3 (n = 15)34 ± 4 (n = 15)51 ± 4 (n = 15) Open table in a new tab Peroxisomal Ca2+Uptake in Stimulated CHO Cells—To investigate the mechanism leading to the large agonist-evoked [Ca2+]perox increase, we tested the effect of reagents dissipating pH gradients across biological membranes (Fig. 3). In ATP-challenged CHO cells expressing peroxAEQmut, the clear reduction of [Ca2+]perox peaks induced by chloroquine or the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP (untreated, 98 ± 10 μm, n = 15; chloroquine-treated, 78 ± 6 μm, n = 10; FCCP-treated, 58 ± 5 μm, n = 10; Fig. 3A) suggested that a H+ gradient may exist across the peroxisomal membrane. Therefore, because biological membrane H+ gradients can be accomplished by a H+-ATPase activity, we monitored the agonist-evoked [Ca2+]perox peaks in the presence of oligomycin or bafilomycin, as inhibitors of the F-type and V-type ATPases (25Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 26Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 27Walker J.E. Dickson V.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 3A). Oligomycin did not influence the peroxisomal Ca2+ uptake (not shown), whereas bafilomycin produced a ∼30% reduction of [Ca2+]perox peaks, as compared with controls (nontreated, 101 ± 9 μm, n = 15; oligomycin-treated, 107 ± 12 μm, n = 9; bafilomycin-treated, 62 ± 8 μm, n = 15) (Fig. 3A), suggesting the presence of a peroxisomal vacuolar(V)-type ATPase activity in CHO cells. A stronger decrease of [Ca2+]perox peaks was observed in agonist-stimulated cells treated with the Na+/H+ ionophore monensin (control, 98 ± 10 μm, n = 15; monensin-treated, 26 ± 5 μm, n = 15) (Fig. 3A), and importantly, the combination of monensin with FCCP almost completely abolished the [Ca2+]perox peaks (monensin + FCCP-treated, 8 ± 3 μm, n = 15) (Fig. 3A). The rapid peroxisomal Ca2+ uptake in ATP-stimulated CHO cells could therefore be led by gradients of both H+ and Na+ ions. It should be noted that FCCP, but not monensin, reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 3B); however, its inhibitory effect was significantly more pronounced in mitochondria than in peroxisomes ([Ca2+]mit, control, 64 ± 9 μm, n = 15; FCCP-treated 4.5 ± 3 μm, n = 15; monensin-treated, 68 ± 8 μm, n = 15). Furthermore, both reagents did not affect the agonist-challenged [Ca2+]cyt changes (not shown). The involvement of Na+ and nonspecifically of a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in agonist-evoked peroxisomal Ca2+ uptake was confirmed by using the benzothiazepine CGP37157 (28Cox D.A. Matlib M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 938-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, in the presence of CGP37157, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was enhanced ([Ca2+]mit, untreated, 64 ± 9 μm, n = 15; CGP37157-treated, 98 ± 7 μm, n = 15), whereas it diminished in peroxisomes ([Ca2+]perox, untreated, 102 ± 6 μm, n = 10; CGP37157-treated, 70 ± 8 μm, n = 10) and remained unaltered in cytosol ([Ca2+]cyt, untreated, 2.1 ± 0.3 μm, n = 15; CGP37157-treated, 2.0 ± 0.4 μm, n = 15; not shown). The increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by CGP37157 is accounted for by its inhibitory effect on the mitochondrial Ca2+/Na+ exchanger that exports Ca2+ from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol (28Cox D.A. Matlib M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 938-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the peroxisomal membrane a Ca2+/Na+ exchanger inhibited by CGP37157 and responsible in part for the agonist-evoked peroxisomal Ca2+ uptake might be present. Overall, the above-reported results indicate that two components, represented by the Ca2+/H+ and Ca2+/Na+ exchangers, are involved in peroxisomal agonist-evoked Ca2+ uptake. Peroxisomal pH Changes upon Addition of Ca2+-mobilizing Agonists—Given the effect of the reagents dissipating membrane H+ gradients on the agonist-induced [Ca2+]perox changes, we monitored the peroxisomal pH in ATP-stimulated CHO cells expressing the ratiometric pH-sensitive probe pHluorin. As shown in Fig. 4, upon cell stimulation peroxisomal Ca2+ influx occurs contemporary with a bland alkalinization of peroxisomal pH soon followed by a more marked and protracted transient acidification mainly associated to the subsequent Ca2+ efflux. According to these data, if the Ca2+ influx may take part along with a hardly monitorable H+ efflux, the subsequent peroxisomal acidification of the lumen suggests that Ca2+ re-extrusion occurs, directly or indirectly, in exchange with H+. Such a prolonged compensatory response of the organelle in part recalls what happens in mitochondria where transitory alkalinization of the mitochondrial matrix occurs when Ca2+-mobilizing agents are added (29Abad M.F.

Peroxisomal Ca2+Content in Resting Conditions—The experiments performed using peroxAEQmut revealed a low number of total luminescence counts as compared with those recorded with cytAEQwt or mitAEQmut (Fig. 5). The possibility that peroxisomes concentrate Ca2+ in their lumen during resting conditions, consuming the peroxisomally reconstituted aequorin (13Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R.

https://openalex.org/W1973256540,"Protein kinase C-delta (PKC-delta) plays a pivotal role in mediating thrombin-induced NF-kappaB activation and ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. However, the downstream mechanisms mediating its function are unclear. In this study, we show that PKC-delta-mediated activation of protein-tyrosine kinase Syk plays an important role in thrombin signaling of NF-kappaB activation and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in endothelial cells. Stimulation of human vascular endothelial cells with thrombin resulted in a time-dependent phosphorylation of Syk on tyrosine 525 and 526, an indication of Syk activation. Inhibition of PKC-delta by pharmacological and genetic approaches prevented Syk activation by thrombin. These results place Syk downstream of PKC-delta in transmitting thrombin-activated signaling in endothelial cells. Consistent with this, thrombin-induced NF-kappaB activity and ICAM-1 expression were prevented by the expression of a kinase-defective mutant or RNA interference knockdown of Syk. Similarly, inhibiting Syk also impaired NF-kappaB activity and ICAM-1 expression induced by a constitutively active mutant of PKC-delta. Analysis of the NF-kappaB pathway showed that Syk contributes to thrombin-induced NF-kappaB activation by controlling its transactivation potential and that this response is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of RelA/p65. Thus, these data unveil a novel pathway in which Syk signals downstream of PKC-delta to mediate thrombin induced ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells by increasing transcriptional capacity of NF-kappaB via a mechanism that relies on tyrosine phosphorylation of RelA/p65."
https://openalex.org/W2001052106,"Emerging evidence suggests that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a physiological regulator of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) expression. Herein we used ovarian cancer cells as a model to investigate the molecular mechanisms that link the LPA G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to Cox-2 expression. LPA stimulated Cox-2 expression and release of prostaglandins though the LPA(1), LPA(2), and LPA(5) receptors. The effect of LPA involves both transcriptional activation and post-transcriptional enhancement of Cox-2 mRNA stability. The consensus sites for C/EBP in the Cox-2 promoter were essential for transcriptional activation of Cox-2 by LPA. The NF-kappaB and AP-1 transcription factors commonly involved in inducible Cox-2 expression were dispensable. Dominant-negative C/EPBbeta inhibited LPA activation of the Cox-2 promoter and expression. Furthermore, LPA stimulated C/EBPbeta phosphorylation and activity through a novel mechanism integrating GPCR signals and a permissive activity from a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). This role of RTK was not consistent with LPA activation of C/EBP through transactivation of RTK, as full activation of RTKs with their own agonists only weakly stimulated C/EBP. In addition to the transcriptional activation, the RNA stabilization protein HuR bound to and protected Cox-2 mRNA in LPA-stimulated cells, indicating an active role for HuR in sustaining Cox-2 induction during physiological responses."
https://openalex.org/W2064888445,"A causal relationship between diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and accelerated atherosclerosis has been established in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice. However, it is not known whether the proatherogenic effect of HHcy in apoE(-/-) mice is independent of hyperlipidemia and/or deficiency of apoE. In this study, a comprehensive dietary approach using C57BL/6J mice was used to investigate whether HHcy is an independent risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis or dependent on additional dietary factors that increase plasma lipids and/or inflammation. C57BL/6J mice at 4 wk of age were divided into 6 dietary groups: chow diet (C), chow diet + methionine (C+M), western-type diet (W), western-type diet + methionine (W+M), atherogenic diet (A), or atherogenic diet + methionine (A+M). After 2, 10, 20, or 40 wk on the diets, mice were sacrificed, and the levels of total plasma homocysteine, cysteine, and glutathione, as well as total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were analyzed. Aortic root sections were examined for atherosclerotic lesions. HHcy was induced in all groups supplemented with methionine, compared to diet-matched control groups. Plasma total cholesterol was significantly increased in mice fed the W or A diet. However, the W diet increased LDL/IDL and HDL levels, while the A diet significantly elevated plasma VLDL and LDL/IDL levels without increasing HDL. No differences in plasma total cholesterol levels or lipid profiles were observed between methionine-supplemented groups and the diet-matched control groups. Early atherosclerotic lesions containing macrophage foam cells were only observed in mice fed the A or A + M diet. Furthermore, lesion size was significantly larger in the A + M group compared to the A group at 10 and 20 wk; however, mature lesions were never observed even after 40 wk on these diets. The presence of lymphocytes, increased hyaluronan staining, and the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers were also increased in atherosclerotic lesions from the A + M group. Taken together, these results suggest that HHcy does not independently cause atherosclerosis in C57BL/6J mice even in the presence of increased total plasma lipids induced by the W diet. However, HHcy can accelerate atherosclerotic lesion development under dietary conditions that increase plasma VLDL levels and/or inflammation."

In mammalian cells, the only pathway for inositol breakdown utilizes myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) 3The abbreviations used are: MIOX, myo-inositol oxygenase; Mm- and Hs-MIOX, mouse and human MIOX, respectively; wt-MIOX, wild-type human MIOX. 3The abbreviations used are: MIOX, myo-inositol oxygenase; Mm- and Hs-MIOX, mouse and human MIOX, respectively; wt-MIOX, wild-type human MIOX. to catalyze the first committed step by a dioxygen-dependent cleavage between C1 and C6 of the inositol ring to form d-glucuronate, which can then enter the glucuronate-xylulose pathway (2Arner R.J. Prabhu K.S. Thompson J.T. Hildenbrandt G.R. Liken A.D. Reddy C.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therapeutic intervention aimed at inhibiting MIOX activity may be a future cure for diabetic complications caused by inositol depletion. 18O labeling studies have shown that MIOX incorporates only a single oxygen into the product and that oxygen is found exclusively in the d-glucuronate carboxylate group. MIOX has a pH optimum of 9.5 (3Naber N.I. Swan J.S. Hamilton G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7201-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with myo-inositol (Km = 5.9 mm; kcat = 11 min-1 (2Arner R.J. Prabhu K.S. Thompson J.T. Hildenbrandt G.R. Liken A.D. Reddy C.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) and its epimer d-chiro-inositol (Km = 33 mm; kcat = 2.3 min-1 (2Arner R.J. Prabhu K.S. Thompson J.T. Hildenbrandt G.R. Liken A.D. Reddy C.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) as its only known substrates. Moreover, the only known reasonably potent inhibitor is myo-inosose-1 (Ki = 62 μm (3Naber N.I. Swan J.S. Hamilton G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7201-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar)). It has been noted that an N-terminally truncated fragment starting at Thr32 is formed upon storage of recombinant protein (4Arner R.J. Prabhu K.S. Reddy C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this uncharacterized N-terminal fragment is also observed in vivo (5Arner R.J. Prabhu K.S. Krishnan V. Johnson M.C. Reddy C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was recently shown, using EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy, that MIOX is a new member of the nonheme diiron-dependent dioxygen-activating family (6Xing G. Barr E.W. Diao Y. Hoffart L.M. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5402-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sequence indicated strong dissimilarity to other members of this family (6Xing G. Barr E.W. Diao Y. Hoffart L.M. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5402-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that all feature a core four-helix bundle, as shown by the structures of, for example, protein R2 of ribonucleotide reductase (7Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), soluble methane monoxygenase (8Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nordlund P. Nature. 1993; 366: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), and stearoylacyl carrier protein Δ9-desaturase (9Lindqvist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 10Nordlund P. Eklund H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MIOX uses an antiferromagnetically coupled high spin mixed valent diiron (II/III) cluster for catalysis, and the mixed valent state is regenerated after each cycle of catalysis (6Xing G. Barr E.W. Diao Y. Hoffart L.M. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5402-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In studies of MIOX from mice (Mm-MIOX) it was found that myo-inositol perturbs the diiron clusterŉs Mössbauer and EPR spectra, presumably by binding directly to the cluster (11Xing G. Hoffart L.M. Diao Y. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5393-5401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A tentative (superoxo) diiron (III/III) complex (“G-complex”) can be trapped using a deuterated substrate (12Xing G. Diao Y. Hoffart L.M. Barr E.W. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6130-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The formation of the G-complex is reversible (40-s), thus disfavoring a scenario involving O–O cleavage and the utilization of higher iron oxidation states than the ferric (12Xing G. Diao Y. Hoffart L.M. Barr E.W. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6130-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EPR hyperfine interaction data support a coordination of the dioxygen species, where it binds to only one of the irons in the diiron cluster. Based on spectroscopic data, a mechanism was proposed in which the G-complex, after dioxygen species-mediated aliphatic hydrogen abstraction from the myo-inositol C1, decomposes to product via either a 1-hydroperoxy or a gem-diolate intermediate (12Xing G. Diao Y. Hoffart L.M. Barr E.W. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6130-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the substrate was proposed to bridge the two irons with C1-O as an alkoxide (12Xing G. Diao Y. Hoffart L.M. Barr E.W. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6130-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The presence of an iron-substrate alkoxide bond could be confirmed with 2H ENDOR spectroscopy (13Kim S.H. Xing G. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Krebs C. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 10374-10375Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of Mm-MIOX determined at 2.0 Å resolution has recently been published (14Brown P.M. Caradoc-Davies T.T. Dickson J.M.J. Cooper G.J.S. Loomes K.M. Baker E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15032-15037Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mm-MIOX was shown to have a novel overall topology reminiscent of the HD domain superfamily of metal-binding phosphohydrolases and to possess a novel diiron cluster first coordination sphere with four histidines and two aspartates, and, contrary to what had been previously proposed (6Xing G. Barr E.W. Diao Y. Hoffart L.M. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5402-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Xing G. Hoffart L.M.

Krebs C. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 10374-10375Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), substrate was found to bind terminally to the diiron cluster (14Brown P.M. Caradoc-Davies T.T. Dickson J.M.J. Cooper G.J.S. Loomes K.M. Baker E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15032-15037Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The structure in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, in essence, confirmed a mechanism previously proposed from spectroscopic data (12Xing G. Diao Y. Hoffart L.M. Barr E.W. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6130-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the Mm-MIOX structure, a hairpin loop (residues 83–93) was found lining the entrance to the active site and was proposed to be important for substrate access to the active site through the formation of a lid covering the substrate-binding pocket (14Brown P.M. Caradoc-Davies T.T. Dickson J.M.J. Cooper G.J.S. Loomes K.M. Baker E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15032-15037Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Additionally, in the mechanism based on the Mm-MIOX structure, a lysine (Lys127) was given a critical role in promoting ionization of the C1 hydroxyl and in activation of the bond between C1 and its aliphatic hydrogen (14Brown P.M. Caradoc-Davies T.T. Dickson J.M.J. Cooper G.J.S. Loomes K.M. Baker E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15032-15037Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Mm-MIOX K127A mutant was inactive. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of human MIOX (Hs-MIOX) determined using single wavelength anomalous dispersion methods. Furthermore, we provide biochemical and biophysical evidence for the importance of two additional proteinous lids that cover and shield the enzymeŉs active site. In addition, we propose a model for how Lys127 mutants render the enzyme inactive by modulating access to the active site of MIOX. Cloning and Protein Production—For crystallization, DNA encoding residues 38–285 of the human MIOX gene (gi:49522836) was cloned by ligation-independent cloning into a pET-28-based expression vector incorporating an N-terminal His6 tag fusion (pNIC-Bsa4; gi:EF198016). After transformation and liquid culture growth using standard methods, recombinant expression of Hs-MIOX in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was induced at 291 K by the addition of 0.5 mm IPTG to minimal media for selenomethionine incorporation according to the methionine pathway inhibition method (15Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Induction was maintained for 18 h before harvesting. MIOX was purified using IMAC (16Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar) on a 1-ml HiTrap chelating HP column followed by gel filtration on a 120-ml Superdex 75 column. The N-terminal tag with the His tag fusion and residual cloning elements were excised through incubation with tobacco etch virus protease (1:20 protease/protein ratio) for 48 h at 277 K. After protease digestion, the IMAC purification was repeated to remove noncleaved protein and the His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease. After additional purification by ion exchange chromatography on a 1-l MonoQ column (in Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol by varying NaCl concentration), MIOX was essentially pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. All columns used were from GE-Healthcare. Denaturing electrospray ionization mass spectrometry verified protein integrity and indicated almost full selenomethionine incorporation. Iron content was determined colorimetrically (17Atkin C.L. Thelander L. Reichard P. Lang G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be ∼1.8 irons/MIOX molecule. Crystallization and Structure Solution—Crystals of selenomethionine-labeled Hs-MIOX were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 293 K. MIOX (15 mg/ml in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm TCEP, 5 mm myo-inositol, 1 mm l-cysteine, and 1 mm FeCl3) was mixed with an equal amount (0.6 μl) of reservoir solution (100 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1.8 m ammonium sulfate). Crystals grew initially as rods, but after 2 months of incubation, platelike crystals appeared. The rod-shaped crystals diffracted to 3 Å resolution at best and were not significantly improved even after extensive optimization efforts. The platelike crystals, on the other hand, diffracted up to 1.5 Å on a synchrotron (see below). A platelike crystal was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after having been swept through a reservoir solution with 10% (2R, 3R)-(-)-2,3-butanediol, 5 mm myo-inositol, 1 mm l-cysteine, and 1 mm FeCl3. A single wavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected on the K-edge of selenium (0.9798 Å) at the beam line ID29 (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The data were indexed in space group C2 with unit cell parameters a = 119.7, b = 55.86, c = 111.5 Å, and β = 116.7°. XDS/XSCALE (18Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3225) Google Scholar) was used to process the data (Table 1). XPREP (Bruker AXS) was used to prepare FA values for substructure solution in SHELXD (19Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar) that found 17 of the possible 20 sites. The identified sites were used for phase calculation in SHARP (20Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), followed by density modification in PIRATE (21Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 55: 1555-1567Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The resulting map could be partially autotraced using ARP/wARP (22Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S.

The optical resolution (minimum distance of two resolved peaks in the electron density map) of all of the data to 1.5 Å resolution is 1.36 Å, whereas using only 1.8 Å data gives an optical resolution of 1.48 Å, according to SFCHECK (23Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). SFCHECK calculates the optical resolution from the width of a single Gaussian fitted to the Patterson origin peak (23Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Site-directed point mutations (Fig. 4) were obtained by a two-step PCR method. N-terminal deletions (Fig. 4) were performed by recloning consecutively shorter PCR fragments. Activity assays were performed as described (2Arner R.J. Prabhu K.S. Thompson J.T. Hildenbrandt G.R. Liken A.D. Reddy C.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) on purified Hs-MIOX. Relative errors were estimated from variation between several experiments. Biophysical Characterization of Wild Type and Mutants—To obtain an EPR-observable mixed valent state of the diiron site in MIOX, 180 μl of 100 μm Hs-MIOX were dissolved in aerobic Tris buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mm) and reduced in the EPR tube by 5 mm ascorbate (prepared anaerobically) in the absence or presence of 50 mm myo-inositol. Samples that were reduced anaerobically and subsequently oxidized by molecular oxygen according to Ref. 6Xing G. Barr E.W. Diao Y. Hoffart L.M. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5402-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar resulted in comparatively lower yields of the mixed valent species. 9.5 GHz EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300 X-band spectrometer with an Oxford Instruments ESR9 helium cryostat in a temperature range of 5–20 K using a 0.5 millitesla modulation amplitude. The experimental spectra were corrected by subtracting a spectrum of the buffer alone and by a contaminant Cu2+ spectrum that in some cases was disturbing. Spin quantitation was performed by double integration of EPR spectra recorded at nonsaturating microwave power levels, comparing with a standard solution of 1 mm CuSO4 in 10 mm EDTA. Spectra simulations were performed with the Bruker SimFonia simulation package. EPR saturation data were collected by measuring the EPR absorption derivative signal intensity as a function of microwave power at three different temperatures. The saturation data were fitted to the expression (26Rutter R. Hager L.P. Dhonau H. Hendrich M. Valentine M. Debrunner P. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6809-6816Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), S/P½ ∼ (1 + P/P½)—½, where S represents the EPR derivative signal intensity, P is the microwave power, and P½ is the half-saturation power. A nonlinear least squares fit to this equation yielded a P½ value for each particular temperature. Overall Structure of Hs-MIOX—The three-dimensional structure of Hs-MIOX, residues 38–285, is shown in Fig. 1. The Hs-MIOX has an overall topology that consists of eight α-helices and a small two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that act as a topological latch (Fig. 1). The overall structure of Hs-MIOX superimposes closely (Fig. 2A) with the Mm-MIOX structure with 0.5 Å root mean square deviation on Cα:s and with 86% sequence identity over the structural alignment. However, in the vicinity of the active site, there are significant differences relating to the lack of the 37 N-terminal amino acids in the Hs-MIOX construct used here for crystallization. Specifically, in the Mm-MIOX structure (Fig. 2B), Asp90 forms a strong interaction with the backbone NH of Arg29, and this governs the conformation of Asp88, through the rigid intermediate Pro89, to interact strongly with Lys257, which in turn forms a stacking interaction with Phe28 (not modeled in Protein Data Bank code 2HUO (14Brown P.M. Caradoc-Davies T.T. Dickson J.M.J. Cooper G.J.S. Loomes K.M. Baker E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15032-15037Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) but modeled in our redeposition, 3BXD). Hence, the three loops covering the active site form interdependent interactions in Mm-MIOX. The lack of one of the members (residues 28–32) in this group of three loops explains the observed disorder in these regions (Fig. 2B) in our crystallized construct of Hs-MIOX that lacks the first 37 amino acids (Δ37).FIGURE 2Comparison between human and mouse MIOX.

It represents a strictly conserved (supplemental Fig. S1) diiron cluster first coordination sphere with four histidines and two aspartates (Fig. 3, A and C), and, contrary to what has been previously proposed (6Xing G. Barr E.W. Diao Y. Hoffart L.M. Prabhu K.S. Arner R.J. Reddy C.C. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5402-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Xing G. Hoffart L.M.

Krebs C. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 10374-10375Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) but similar to the Mm-MIOX structure, substrate binds terminally to the diiron cluster. In the cluster, the most solvent-exposed iron ion, FeA, is octahedrally coordinated by His98, His123, Asp253, a bridging Asp124, and one bridging and one directly bound oxygen species. The second, innermost iron, FeB, is coordinated by a distorted octahedron formed by His194, His220, the bridging Asp124, one bridging oxygen species, and the C1-O and C6-O oxygens from a terminally bound substrate-like molecule. In the active site, there are three major differences to the Mm-MIOX structure. First, the bridging oxygen species is asymmetrically bound (Fig. 1C) in Hs-MIOX while symmetrically bound in Mm-MIOX. Second, Asp124 bridges the diiron cluster asymmetrically in Hs-MIOX but symmetrically in Mm-MIOX. In addition, the outermost iron (FeA) is further away from Asp124 in the Hs-MIOX structure as compared with the Mm-MIOX structure. This is partly reflected in a 0.2-Å closer Fe-Fe distance in Mm-MIOX compared with Hs-MIOX. Third, the substrate, which ligates the innermost iron (FeB) in a strictly symmetrically bidental fashion (2.0 Å between FeB and both O1 and O6) in the Mm-MIOX structure (14Brown P.M. Caradoc-Davies T.T. Dickson J.M.J. Cooper G.J.S. Loomes K.M. Baker E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15032-15037Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), is highly asymmetrical in the Hs-MIOX structure (Fig. 1C). This can partly be explained by the different nature of the Hs-MIOX ligand (see below). Binding of Substrate-like Ligand—The substrate-like molecule bound to FeB has suitable hydrogen bonding partners for all exocyclical hydroxyl groups (Fig. 3B), where it binds in a relatively tight groove. The hydrogen-bonding pattern is preorganized with special emphasis on the axial C2-O, which protrudes into a pocket, where it forms strong hydrogen bonds to nitrogen of Gly141 and Oδ2 of Asp85 from opposite sides. During refinement of the structure, it became apparent that C1 of the presumed myo-inositol molecule bound to FeB was, in fact, sp2-hybridized (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, the structure presented here represents myo-inosose-1 bound to Hs-MIOX. myo-Inosose-1 is a known inhibitor of the enzyme (3Naber N.I. Swan J.S. Hamilton G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7201-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is, however, unclear whether it was formed during the 2-month crystallization period or if it is a minute contaminant in commercial preparations of myo-inositol. Importance of the N Terminus; Structure and Activity—It has been noted that an N-terminally truncated fragment starting at Thr32 is formed upon storage of recombinant protein but also in mammalian cells expressing MIOX (5Arner R.J. Prabhu K.S. Krishnan V. Johnson M.C. Reddy C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The N terminus covers partly the active site, but, most importantly, it orchestrates the conformation of two other loops so that all three loops jointly seal off the active site from bulk solvent (see above and Fig. 2C). Therefore, we tested whether N-terminal truncations affected activity. Fig. 4 shows various protein constructs and their enzymatic activities compared with wt-MIOX. We find that the activity drops significantly only between cuts at residue Lys25 and Thr32 (Fig. 4). Mutating the first conserved residue in MIOX, Arg29 (supplemental Fig. S1), which is present in this region, shows intermediate activity compared with N-terminal deletions at residues Lys25 and Thr32 (Fig. 4). The Asp38–Trp285 fragment (called Δ37), corresponding to the crystallized molecule, has ∼18% of wild type activity. The K127S mutant is essentially inactive. We further investigated the effects of MIOX mutations by performing EPR spectroscopy on wt-MIOX and comparing the results with those from selected mutant proteins. EPR Spectroscopy of Hs-MIOX—EPR spectroscopy was used to study wt-MIOX and the selected mutant proteins after ascorbate reduction under aerobic conditions, in the absence or presence of the substrate myo-inositol (Fig. 5, left and right, respectively). The studied mutants were Δ37 (containing residues 38–285), which lacks the residues necessary for forming the “dynamic lid” covering the substrate binding site (see above), the single mutant K127S probing the role of Lys127 near the substrate binding site, and the double mutant Δ37,K127S combining the two variants. The ascorbate/air reduction of all Hs-MIOX constructs results in formation of a mixed valent Fe(II)/Fe(III) species, which is paramagnetic and observable by EPR. Spectrum A in Fig. 5 shows the results of ascorbate reduction of wt-MIOX. This protein forms at least two types of mixed valent Fe(II)/Fe(III) states, resulting in a two-component EPR spectrum with axially symmetric signals. The overall intensity of the EPR spectrum corresponded to about 0.2 mixed valent sites per Hs-MIOX protein molecule. The two-component EPR signals are detectable in the same low temperature range and hardly saturated with microwave power even at low temperatures. Nev"

Transcription and expression analyses of the genes involved in d-glucarate metabolism within a single organism made it possible to access information regarding the regulation of this pathway for the first time. d-Glucaric acid is a natural product that can serve as a growth substrate for a number of bacteria (3Trudgill P.W.

Two different pathways can be used for d-glucarate metabolism. In Escherichia coli, d-glucarate is dehydrated to d-5-keto-4-deoxyglucarate (KDG) 3The abbreviations used are: KDG, d-5-keto-4-deoxyglucarate; α-KGSA, α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde; CDS, coding sequence; GDH, d-glucarate dehydratase; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. by d-glucarate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.40). KDG is then converted to pyruvate and tartronate semialdehyde by KDG aldolase (EC 4.1.2.20). Tartronate semialdehyde is next reduced to d-glycerate by a tartronate semialdehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.60), and finally, d-glycerate is phosphorylated by a glycerate kinase (EC 2.7.1.31) to yield 3-phosphoglycerate (4Blumenthal H.J. Fish D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1963; 11: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The genes of E. coli responsible for the different enzymatic activities of the pathway have been identified (6Gulick A.M. Hubbard B.K. Gerlt J.A. Rayment I.

KDG is then converted to α-ketoglutarate by the sequential action of KDG dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.41) and α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (α-KGSA dehydrogenase; EC 1.2.1.26). The information on this pathway is scattered and incomplete, limiting the understanding of d-glucarate metabolism. For instance, only a small amount of data for KDG dehydratase are available. Procedures for the purification and the activity assay of the enzyme have been published (11Jeffcoat R. Hassall H. Dagley S. Biochem.

Moreover, although gene identification was recently achieved for α-KGSA dehydrogenase, investigations were restricted to Azospirillum brasilense and Bacillus subtilis (15Watanabe S. Yamada M. Ohtsu I. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6685-6695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, an evolutionarily close relative of Pseudomonas, is a soil γ-proteobacterium that has been sequenced and annotated at Genoscope with special focus on metabolism reconstruction (1Barbe V. Vallenet D. Fonknechten N. Kreimeyer A. Oztas S. Labarre L. Cruveiller S. Robert C. Duprat S. Wincker P. Ornston L.N. Weissenbach J. Marliere P. Cohen G.N. Medigue C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5766-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have constructed a collection of single-gene deletion mutants for all dispensable genes of this organism (2de Berardinis V. Vallenet D. Castelli V. Besnard M. Pinet A. Cruaud C. Samair S. Lechaplais C. Gyapay G. Richez C. Durot M. Kreimeyer A. Le Fèvre L. Schächter V. Pezo V. Döring V. Scarpelli C. Médigue C. Cohen G.N. Marliàre P. Salanoubat M. Weissenbach J. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2008; 4: 174Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A. baylyi ADP1 is capable of using a large variety of compounds as carbon sources. In particular, it can grow on d-glucarate or d-galactarate as its sole carbon source, suggesting the presence of metabolic functions to assimilate these compounds. However, in A. baylyi ADP1, there is no experimental information on their utilization. We took advantage of the availability of the complete collection of single-gene deletion mutants to identify the genes involved in the utilization of d-glucarate by profiling ∼2450 mutants for growth on a medium with d-glucarate as the sole carbon source. Based on this strategy, we describe here the enzymatic and transcriptional analysis of proteins and genes involved in d-glucarate utilization in A. baylyi ADP1. Chemicals—All chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma. Reagents for molecular biology were from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were from Sigma. Proteinase inhibitor Pefabloc SC was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The Lysonase™ bioprocessing reagent was from Novagen. KDG was prepared by enzymatic conversion of d-glucarate by d-glucarate dehydratase in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 in Activity Buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). The reaction was stopped by trifluoroacetic acid and neutralized by 5 m K2CO3. α-Ketoglutarate semialdehyde (α-KGSA) was prepared by enzymatic conversion of d-glucarate by d-glucarate dehydratase and KDG dehydratase, in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 in Activity Buffer. The reaction was stopped by trifluoroacetic acid and neutralized by 5 m K2CO3. Bacteria and Media—The A. baylyi ADP1 strain was provided by Dr. Nicholas Ornston (Yale University). Cells were routinely grown on MA minimal medium (31 mm Na2HPO4; 25 mm KH2PO4; 18 mm NH4Cl; 41 μm nitrilotriacetic acid; 2 mm MgSO4; 0.45 mm CaCl2; 3 μm FeCl3; 1 μm MnCl2; 1 μm ZnCl2; 0.3 μm CrCl3, H3BO3, CoCl2, CuCl2, NiCl2, Na2MoO4, Na2SeO3) supplemented with 25 mm carbon source and used with or without kanamycin at 30 μg/ml. Growth Test—Growth phenotyping was performed in 96-well microplates according to de Berardinis et al. (2de Berardinis V. Vallenet D. Castelli V. Besnard M. Pinet A. Cruaud C. Samair S. Lechaplais C.

Biol. 2008; 4: 174Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Complementation Experiments—For the complementation tests, primers were designed to amplify the whole gene from start to stop codons. Primers were extended by PacI and NotI restriction sites for the primer located upstream and downstream of the gene, respectively. The PCR product was then cloned into the PacI/NotI sites of plasmid pEVL174 (2de Berardinis V. Vallenet D. Castelli V. Besnard M. Pinet A. Cruaud C. Samair S. Lechaplais C. Gyapay G. Richez C.

Biol. 2008; 4: 174Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) downstream of the bacteriophage T5 promoter replacing the tdk gene and transformed in E. coli. The sequence of each plasmid construction was verified before transformation of A. baylyi ADP1. The transformation step was done as described by Metzgar et al. (16Metzgar D. Bacher J.M. Pezo V. Reader J. Doring V. Schimmel P. Marliere P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5780-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The colonies were spread onto MA agar plates containing the desired carbon source, carbenicillin and kanamycin, both at 30 μg/ml. Transcription Analysis—For RNA preparation, A. baylyi ADP1 cells were cultured at 30 °C to midexponential phase in MA containing succinate or d-glucarate as the sole carbon source. The bacterial culture was stopped by adding 1.25 ml of stabilization solution (5% phenol plus 95% ethanol) per 10 ml of culture. The culture was then centrifuged at 4300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded. After lysozyme digestion, the bacterial cells were lysed by adding 1% SDS at 64 °C. Then one-tenth volume of 1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and an equal volume of saturated phenol/water were added and incubated for 6 min at 64 °C. After chilling on ice, the tubes were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The upper phase was transferred to a new tube and was extracted by an equal volume of chloroform. The RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The quality of the extracted RNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the incidental DNA contamination was checked by PCR using specific primers. In case of DNA contamination, an additional DNase digestion was carried out. Co-transcription was assayed on reverse transcribed RNA by using PCR primers designed to generate specific fragments if two consecutive genes are transcribed on the same RNA molecule. The primers used are shown in the supplemental data (Table S1). The reverse transcription-PCRs were carried out using the Qiagen One Step RT-PCR kit. Briefly, 350 ng of total RNA was used as starting material. The reverse transcription was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by a denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 min. Then 35 cycles of PCR were performed (94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min). The results were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The quantitative PCR was carried out in 25 μl, in a MX3005P qPCR machine (Stratagene). After 3 min of denaturing at 95 °C, 40 cycles of PCR were carried out (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 15 s). The data were analyzed using comparative relative quantifications with correction for reaction efficiency. The primers used for quantitative PCR are shown in the supplemental data (Table S1). Construction of the Expression Vectors—The CDS of d-glucarate dehydratase (GDH), KDG dehydratase, and α-KGSA dehydrogenases from A. baylyi ADP1 and Pseudomonas putida (αKGSADH_ADP1 and αKGSADH_PP, respectively) were amplified by PCR with the primer set shown in the supplemental data (Table S1). The amplified sequences were inserted into the Invitrogen pEXP5-NT/TOPO vector according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of the resulting plasmids were verified. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant Proteins—The same protocol for expression and purification was set up for each protein. The modified expression vector was transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 (Invitrogen). Transformed cells were grown in 0.25 liter of Terrific Broth medium containing 0.5 m sorbitol, 5 mm betaine, and 100 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C until reaching an A600 of 2. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at a concentration of 500 μm to induce protein production, and the cells were further grown at 20 °C overnight. After centrifugation, cells were washed and suspended in 30 ml of Lysis Buffer (50 mm phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole) containing 1 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science) and 13 μl of Lysonase™ bioprocessing reagent and sonicated using an ultrasonic processor. After centrifugation to clarify the cell extract, the supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml HisTrap FF column (Amersham Biosciences) using an Äkta Explorer (Amersham Biosciences). After sample loading, the column was washed with Lysis Buffer, and the protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Buffer exchange was performed using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) with a mobile phase composed of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was further purified by ion exchange using a MonoQ 5/50 GL column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with an NaCl gradient ranging from 50 mm to 1 m over 100 column volumes. Finally, the protein was submitted to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein was stored at –80 °C. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the Invitrogen NuPAGE system. Preparation of A. baylyi ADP1 Cell Extracts—Cells were grown on MA supplemented with 25 mm of the desired carbon source. 200-ml cultures were grown at 30 °C with vigorous shaking until reaching an A600 of 1. After centrifugation, cells were suspended in 3 ml of Lysis Buffer containing 1 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science) and 1 μl of Lysonase™ bioprocessing reagent and sonicated. The cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard (Bio-Rad). Analytical Methods—NADH and NADPH were determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 m–1 cm–1. α-KGSA was assayed by 5 μgof α-KGSA dehydrogenase in the presence of 4 mm NADP+ in Activity Buffer. Its concentration was given by monitoring the formation of NADPH spectrophotometrically. Enzymatic reactions were stopped by trifluoroacetic acid and neutralized by 5 m K2CO3. α-Ketoglutarate was assayed with glutamate dehydrogenase in the presence of 50 mm NH4Cl in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5. LC/MS Analyses—All LC/MS analyses were carried out using an LTQ/Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer coupled to a Accela LC system (Thermo-Fisher). Chromatographic separation of metabolites was conducted using an IOA-1000 column (9 μm, 7.8 × 300 mm; Alltech) thermostatted at 60 °C using an isocratic gradient (water plus 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The entire eluant was sprayed into the mass spectrometer using a heated electrospray ionization source (150 °C) at 4.5 kV with sheath, auxiliary, and sweep gases set at 50, 35, and 5 arbitrary units, respectively. Desolvation of the solvent droplets was further aided by setting the heated capillary temperature at 275 °C. d-Glucarate and its metabolites were detected by full scan mass analysis from m/z 50–1000 at a resolving power of 30,000 at m/z = 400. Data-dependent scanning was performed without use of a parent ion list. The resulting fragment ions were recorded in the LTQ linear trap. Enzyme Assays—d-Glucarate dehydratase activity was assayed according to a modified procedure of MacGee and Doudoroff (17Macgee J. Doudoroff M. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 210: 617-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KDG was quantified by detection of its semicarbazone at 250 nm upon reaction with semicarbazide in an end point assay. The enzyme assay was conducted using 0.35 μg of d-glucarate dehydratase in 500 μl of Activity Buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of d-glucarate and stopped after 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 min with 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The sample was mixed with 500 μl of 0.1 m semicarbazide hydrochloride (containing 1.5% sodium acetate trihydrate). The mixture was incubated at 22 °C for 30 min, and its absorbance was read in the spectrophotometer. An experimental value of 7200 m–1 cm–1 was determined for the extinction coefficient of KDG semicarbazone. KDG dehydratase activity was assayed in a coupled assay with α-KGSA dehydrogenase, in the presence of NADP+, by monitoring the formation of the resulting reduced pyridine nucleotide. The coupled assay was conducted using 0.5 μgof KDG dehydratase, 2 μgof α-KGSA dehydrogenase, and 4 mm NADP+ in 500 μl of Activity Buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of KDG. α-KGSA dehydrogenase activity was assayed in the presence of various substrates and with NAD+ or NADP+ as cofactors by monitoring the formation of the reduced pyridine nucleotide. Reactions were usually performed in 100 μl of Activity Buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate. The kinetic parameters from these three enzymes were obtained from duplicate experiments by nonlinear analysis of initial rates. The coupled assay involving d-glucarate dehydratase, KDG dehydratase, and α-KGSA dehydrogenase was conducted using 0.3 μgof d-glucarate dehydratase, 0.3 μg of KDG dehydratase, 0.06 μgof α-KGSA dehydrogenase, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm NADP+ in 100 μl of Activity Buffer. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 150 μm glucarate. The stoichiometry of the reaction was determined at equilibrium by monitoring NADPH formation. Enzymatic reactions were stopped by trifluoroacetic acid and neutralized by K2CO3. The final product of the coupled assay, α-ketoglutarate, was then quantified in the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase and NH4Cl. α-KGSA dehydrogenase activity in cell extracts was assayed at 340 nm with 100 μg of protein in 100 μl of Activity Buffer containing 100 μm NADP+. The reaction was measured under two different experimental conditions, in the presence of either 200 μm α-KGSA or 1.5 mm d-glucarate (in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2). All enzymatic reactions were performed at 25 °C in a Safas UV mc2 or a Lambda 650 PerkinElmer double beam spectrophotometer. Finding Genes Involved in d-Glucarate/d-Galactarate Degradation—The growth of the whole mutant collection was investigated on liquid MA minimal medium containing either succinate or d-glucarate as the sole carbon source. Growth data are shown in the supplemental data (Fig. S1). Eight mutants were either unable to grow or had a severe growth impairment on d-glucarate (Table 1). These genes are good candidates for being involved in d-glucarate degradation. Four of them are co-located on the genome (ACIAD0127, ACIAD0128, ACIAD0130, and ACIAD0131) and are respectively annotated as d-glucarate/d-galactarate permease, d-glucarate dehydratase, KDG dehydratase, and putative α-KGSA dehydrogenase. All of these mutants plus two additional ones annotated as a d-galactarate dehydratase and a transcriptional regulator (ACIAD0126 and -0132) located immediately upstream and downstream from the gene cluster were tested individually for growth on either d-glucarate or d-galactarate. As expected, deletion mutants for ACIAD0127/0128/0130/0131 are unable to grow on d-glucarate, whereas deletion mutants for ACIAD0126/0127/0130/0131 are unable to grow on d-galactarate. The mutant ACIAD0132, annotated as a putative transcriptional regulator, shows no growth defect on both media. These results are consistent with a degradation pathway of d-glucarate/d-galactarate involving the d-glutarate/d-galactarate permease (ACIAD0127), followed by a dehydration in KDG by a dehydratase specific for d-glucarate (ACIAD0128) and one specific for d-galactarate (ACIAD0126). KDG is then converted to α-ketoglutarate by the sequential action of KDG dehydratase (ACIAD0130) and α-KGSA dehydrogenase (ACIAD0131). This d-glucarate degradation pathway is similar to the one proposed in P. putida. We have attempted to complement mutants ΔACIAD0126, ΔACIAD0127, ΔACIAD0128, ΔACIAD0130, and ΔACIAD0131 by the corresponding coding sequences (CDS) cloned in the expression vector pEVL174. The rescue of the wild type phenotype is obtained for d-glucarate and d-galacarate dehydratases (ACIAD0128 and ACIAD0126) and the α-KGSA dehydrogenase (ACIAD0131). The mutant ΔACIAD0127 is not rescued when the CDS is cloned under the control of the T5 promoter, but the rescue is obtained when the 373-bp region upstream of the CDS, which is supposed to contain the actual promoter, is kept. This result suggests that the T5 promoter is not strong enough to achieve functional complementation. Growth of ΔACIAD0130 complemented by the corresponding CDS on d-glucarate is obtained after 5–7 days of incubation. The lag time observed is explained by an increase by a factor of 10 in the division time of the complemented mutant compared with the wild type and could be due to the limited amount of α-ketoglutarate produced by the d-glucarate degradation. This hypothesis has been confirmed by the wild type growth observed in the mutant ΔACIAD0128-130-131 complemented by the operon (ACIAD0128-130-131) under the control of its own promoter (373 bp upstream from the AUG of ACIAD0128).

ACIAD2876 encodes the E1 subunit of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and ACIAD2275, a lipoate synthase that catalyzes the formation of lipoic acid, a cofactor required for function of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Since the end product of d-glucarate degradation is α-ketoglutarate, a metabolite present in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the essentiality of these two genes for growth on d-glucarate is expected. Moreover, two lipoate synthases are present in the Acinetobacter genome, and the growth of only one of the mutants is impaired on d-glucarate/d-galactarate. This suggests that only the product ACIAD2275 is involved in the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex for growth on these compounds. The other mutant with impaired growth on d-glucarate encodes a methyl transferase (ACIAD2447), and further investigations will be needed to connect the observed phenotype with the function of this gene. Expression and Purification of the Enzymes Involved in d-Glucarate Degradation—The three enzymes from A. baylyi ADP1 were produced by cloning their respective CDS into pEXP5-N/TOPO vector for recombinant overexpression in E. coli. The corresponding vectors were transformed into BL21 DE3 cells and the proteins produced and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography, anion exchange, and gel filtration. Sorbitol and betaine were added to the culture medium to improve the yield of soluble and properly folded recombinant protein (18Kreimeyer A. Perret A. Lechaplais C. Vallenet D. Medigue C.

Under these conditions, at least 3 mg of pure and soluble protein were obtained per liter of culture. The purified proteins had an apparent molecular mass of around 38, 55, and 62 kDa on SDS-PAGE, consistent with the calculated molecular masses of 34.96, 51.36, and 58, 48 kDa, for d-glucarate dehydratase, KDG dehydratase, and α-KGSA dehydrogenase, respectively. According to gel filtration experiments, d-glucarate dehydratase was purified as a homotetramer, as reported for the enzymes of P. putida and E. coli (6Gulick A.M. Hubbard B.K. Gerlt J.A. Rayment I.

Chem. 1974; 249: 1704-1716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). But, in contrast to earlier studies conducted by Dagley and Jeffcoat (13Dagley S. Jeffcoat R. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) in which KDG dehydratase from P. acidovorans was described as a dimer, the enzyme of A. baylyi ADP1 appears to be a homotetramer. Functional Assay of the Putative d-Glucarate Degradation Pathway in a Coupled Assay with d-Glucarate Dehydratase, KDG Dehydratase, and α-KGSA Dehydrogenase—A tricoupled enzymatic assay, combining d-glucarate dehydratase, KDG dehydratase, and α-KGSA dehydrogenase, was set up to generate α-ketoglutarate from d-glucarate. The reactions could be monitored by assaying NADPH and α-ketoglutarate. Results reported in Table 2 are consistent with those expected from the global reaction presented in Fig. 1. For each mole of d-glucarate consumed, 1 mol of NADPH (generated by α-KGSA dehydrogenase) and 1 mol of α-ketoglutarate were formed. Since the reactions were monitored using highly purified proteins, it is highly unlikely that the observed products result from other uncharacterized and unexpected activities. Furthermore, LC/MS experiments were conducted to detect each intermediate of the d-glucarate degradation pathway. First, 4 mm d-glucarate was incubated alone in 2 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgSO4.20 μl of the mixture were injected in the LC/MS system. d-Glucarate was detected only in the negative ionization mode at m/z 209.0303, with an accuracy of 2.7 ppm. In a second step, 10 μgof d-glucarate dehydratase were added to the sample and incubated for 1 h. KDG was monitored in the positive ionization mode at m/z 193.0341 (accuracy: 3.6 ppm). As expected, d-glucarate was completely converted by d-glucarate dehydratase (13Dagley S. Jeffcoat R. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), since it was no longer detected. In a third step, 10 μg of KDG dehydratase were added to the previous sample and incubated for a further 1 h. The conversion was complete, since KDG could be no longer be detected. The product was detected in the positive ionization mode with a"

The large number of breaks in the mouse chromosomes and the dense genotyping of the panel allowed extremely sharp mapping of loci. As the regulatory loci result from extra gene dosage, we call them copy number expression quantitative trait loci, or ceQTLs. The -2log10P support interval for the ceQTLs was <150 kb, containing an average of <2-3 genes. We identified 29,769 trans ceQTLs with -log10P > 4, including 13 hotspots each regulating >100 genes in trans. Further, this work identifies 2,761 trans ceQTLs harboring no known genes, and provides evidence for a mode of gene expression autoregulation specific to the X chromosome."

Because DPP subunits are important to determine natural properties of these channels, we sought to establish the structural basis for their operation, specifically, their number in each channel complex. Previously, we found cardiac IKs channels to be formed with two single transmembrane span MinK subunits and four KCNQ1 pore-forming subunits via functional assays (13Chen H. Kim L.A. Rajan S. Xu S.

Here, the stoichiometry of channels naturally assembled with DPP6 and Kv4.2 subunits is first inferred through comparison of the activity of channels formed by Kv4.2 or linked Kv4.2-Kv4.2, Kv4.2-DPP6, or Kv4.2-Kv4.2-DPP6 pore-forming subunits with or without DPP6 and with or without KChIP2.

C-terminal 1d4-tagged Kv4.2 was used for both electrophysiological and biochemical studies, as previously reported (15Kim L.A. Furst J. Butler M.H. Xu S. Grigorieff N. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol.

For biochemical studies, a linker and hemagglutinin (HA) epitope were introduced at the C terminus of DPP6 using PCR with a primer for the protein sequence (TRYPYDVPDYA). To create the tandem, Kv4.2-Kv4.2 (KK), an AscI site was introduced into the twelfth residue, and a MluI site was introduced before the termination codon of Kv4.2. Subsequently, a Kv4.2 fragment was released by digestion with AscI and MluI and inserted into a Kv4.2-containing plasmid opened by MluI; the last residue of the first Kv4.2 subunit is thus linked to the twelfth residue of the second Kv4.2 subunit by an additional arginine residue. To produce Kv4.2-DPP6 (KD) and Kv4.2-Kv4.2-DPP6 (KKD) constructs, an AscI site was introduced into the second residue, and a MluI site was introduced before the termination codon of DPP6. A fragment of DPP6 was released with AscI and MluI and inserted into Kv4.2 or KK containing plasmid opened by MluI. Correct orientation of the insert was confirmed by enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. cRNA was synthesized after linearization with NotI using the T7 promoter and mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and quantified by spectroscopy. Electrophysiology and Data Analysis—Oocytes from Xenopus laevis were defolliculated with collagenase and microinjected with 0.05–0.50 ng of a mixture of pore former and DPP6 subunit cRNAs at 1:2 molar ratio, a ratio chosen to reproducibly recapitulate the effects of DPP6 on Kv4.2 (4Nadal M.S.

Whole cell currents were measured by two-electrode voltage-clamp (oocyte clamp OC-725A; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). The electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.1–0.6 MΩ. The data were sampled at 1 kHz. Data recording was performed using Clampex v8.0 and assessed with Clampfit v9.0 (Molecular Devices, Inc.), Excel (Microsoft, Inc.) and Origin ver6.1 (Rockware, Inc.). All of the experiments were performed at room temperature. The standard bath solution was ND-96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5). The voltage families were obtained from a holding potential of –110 mV with test steps from –80 to +60 mV for 250 ms with 10-mV increments every 10 s; subtraction of currents recorded at test potentials following a 1-s prepulse to –40 mV like others (17Nadal M.S. Amarillo Y. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or P/4 protocols were employed. Steady state inactivation was examined from a holding potential of –100 mV with test pulses from –110 to –20 mV held for 2.5 s with a second pulse to 40 mV to measure currents that were not inactivated. V0.5 of activation and V0.5 of steady state inactivation were calculated by fitting the normalized conductance-voltage relationships with a Boltzmann function (18Clay J.R. Eur. Biophys. J. 2000; 29: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recovery from inactivation was measured by driving channels to an inactivated state at +40 mV, hyperpolarizing to –110 mV, and then applying a second pulse to +40 mV for various intervals (increments of 10 or 25 ms). Inactivation was fitted with a double exponential equation and recovery from inactivation with a single exponential equation. One way analysis of variance was used for statistical tests using Origin ver6.1 software.

Two days after transfection, the cells were incubated in cross-linking buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mg/ml dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate (DTBP; Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature to preserve protein-protein interactions between Kv4.2 and DPP6 (4Nadal M.S.

The cells from 10–20 plates were solubilized for 1 h at 4°C in lysis buffer containing 2.5% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and 10% glycerol with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Soluble material was collected after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The extract was incubated with an anti-1d4 antibody immobilized on Sepharose beads (19Sokolova O. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Grigorieff N. Structure. 2001; 9: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4°C with agitation. The beads were washed with 100 ml of wash buffer containing 0.7% CHAPS, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. Protein was then eluted with 0.7% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, complete protease inhibitor, and 0.1 mg/ml 1d4 peptide (Yale University Keck Facility, New Haven, CT). Finally, cross-links were cleaved by reduction with 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Mouse anti-1d4 (NCCC, Minneapolis, MN) and rat anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) monoclonal antibodies were purchased, and KChIP2 antibodies were a generous gift (J. Trimmer, University of California, Davis). After SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, bands corresponding to Kv4.2, DPP6, and a blank portion of the gel were excised with a sterile scalpel. The samples were hydrolyzed, and the amino acids were quantified (Yale University Keck Facility). Amino acids determined for the blank gel sample were subtracted from test samples to correct for background. These methods have previously been described in detail (15Kim L.A. Furst J. Butler M.H. Xu S. Grigorieff N. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5549-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). DPP6 Impacts Current Magnitude in Channels with Fixed Subunit Ratios—A canonical effect of DPP6 is an increase current density (4Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Amarillo Y. de Miera E.V.-S. Ma Y. Mo W. Goldberg E.M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Neubert T.A. Rudy B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus, natural assembly of DPP6 (D) and Kv4.2 (K) subunits in Xenopus oocytes produced a significant increase in current when assessed by two electrode voltage clamp (Fig. 1A); augmentation led to ∼10-fold greater current than with K subunits alone (Fig. 1B). To assess the number of D subunits required in each channel to enhance K currents, fusion proteins were created to enforce subunit ratios. This was accomplished via synthesis of genes encoding proteins linking two K subunits (KK), two K with one D (KKD), and one K with one D (KD). Because D has an intracellular N terminus, it was fused to the cytoplasmic C terminus of Kv4.2. KKD proteins enforce a subunit ratio of 2:1 and were designed to yield channels with four K subunits and two D (Fig. 1A); although KKD channels were active, their current magnitudes were small like channels formed only with Kv4.2 subunits. Conversely, KD proteins with a 1:1 subunit ratio (designed to incorporate four D subunits per channel) showed an ∼5-fold augmentation in currents compared with KKD channels. Supporting the idea that channels formed by KKD required additional D subunits, co-expression of monomer D with K, KK, and KKD subunits resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in current amplitude (Fig. 1B); conversely, KD current levels were less sensitive to free D, increasing just 3-fold. Although any effect of D on KD channels raised concern that more than four D subunits were required in each channel, gating and protein composition studies suggested otherwise. KD Channels Operate Like Those Naturally Formed of Kv4.2 and DPP6 Subunits—Studies of gating kinetics indicated a 4:4 ratio of K:D subunits was required and sufficient to yield the biophysical characteristics of naturally assembled channels (Table 1). Further, the characteristics of KD channels were not significantly altered by additional D subunits, suggesting that they were complete (Table 1).TABLE 1Channel gating parameters for various Kv4.2 channel complexesChannel subunits expressedActivation V0.5Inactivation V0.5Time to peak at -30 mVInactivationRecovery from inactivation at +40 mVFastSlowAfast/(Afast + Aslow)mVmVmsmsmsmsMonomer K-22.5 ± 1.7 (5)-57.6 ± 1.5 (7)32.8 ± 1.8 (6)18.6 ± 0.9 (9)199 ± 31 (9)0.83 ± 0.01 (9)139.8 ± 9.4 (7) K + D-43.1 ± 0.9 (8)-71.1 ± 1.3 (8)11.5 ± 0.4 (8)13.4 ± 0.8 (10)cDifference significant (p = 0.005) compared with no monomer DPP6.145 ± 35 (10)0.95 ± 0.01 (10)cDifference significant (p = 0.005) compared with no monomer DPP6.40.2 ± 3.3 (6) K + D + KChIP2-34.4 ± 1.7 (7)-55.7 ± 0.9 (7)12.1 ± 0.8 (7)NDNDND12.5 ± 0.8 (7)Linked KD-44.8 ± 1.1 (8)-72.0 ± 0.9 (8)12.1 ± 0.5 (7)11.8 ± 0.4 (6)127 ± 15 (6)0.92 ± 0.01 (6)43.9 ± 1.8 (6) KD + KChIP2-33.0 ± 1.9 (7)-57.7 ± 1.1 (7)13.0 ± 0.8 (7)NDNDND8.8 ± 0.6 (4) KKD-34.5 ± 1.0 (7)aDifference significant (p = 0.001) compared with K + D.-64.3 ± 1.0 (9)aDifference significant (p = 0.001) compared with K + D.18.0 ± 0.6 (8)aDifference significant (p = 0.001) compared with K + D.21.9 ± 1.8 (9)186 ± 38 (9)0.69 ± 0.02 (9)50.9 ± 5.9 (6) KKD + KChIP2-29.4 ± 1.6 (7)-54.6 ± 0.8 (7)21.3 ± 2.0 (6)bDifference significant (p = 0.005) compared with K + D + KChIP2.NDNDND9.7 ± 1.0 (4)Controls KK-21.6 ± 1.8 (7)-56.3 ± 1.8 (8)38.1 ± 2.5 (8)24.2 ± 2.1 (6)252 ± 55 (6)0.71 ± 0.02 (6)154.1 ± 7.6 (6) KK + D-45.1 ± 1.0 (7)-69.6 ± 1.0 (7)10.6 ± 0.5 (7)15.5 ± 1.2 (7)cDifference significant (p = 0.005) compared with no monomer DPP6.235 ± 51 (7)0.86 ± 0.02 (7)cDifference significant (p = 0.005) compared with no monomer DPP6.45.4 ± 3.0 (6) KD + D-47.9 ± 0.7 (4)-75.9 ± 0.5 (4)9.5 ± 0.2 (5)11.7 ± 0.3 (7)158 ± 24 (7)0.93 ± 0.01 (7)ND KKD + D-46.1 ± 2.1 (5)-71.9 ± 0.7 (5)10.1 ± 0.5 (5)19.1 ± 0.6 (5)124 ± 19 (5)0.79 ± 0.01 (5)cDifference significant (p = 0.005) compared with no monomer DPP6.ND KK + D + KChIP2-34.2 ± 1.8 (7)-55.7 ± 0.9 (5)12.8 ± 0.5 (7)NDNDND13.6 ± 1.4 (6)a Difference significant (p = 0.001) compared with K + D.b Difference significant (p = 0.005) compared with K + D + KChIP2.c Difference significant (p = 0.005) compared with no monomer DPP6.

Conversely, monomer D had no effect on KD channel gating (Fig. 2D), and kinetics of activation and inactivation of KD channels were similar to channels formed naturally by K + D subunits (Fig. 2E). These impressions gleaned by visual inspection were supported by the determined gating parameters (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Thus, monomer D produced a 20-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of half-maximal activation of K channels (V0.5 =∼–23 mV) compared with those assembled of K + D subunits (V0.5 =∼–43 mV; Fig. 3A, top panel, and Table 1. Whereas linkage-enforced 1:1 association in KD channels also led to a 20-mV shift (V0.5 =∼–45 mV), KKD channels showed only an intermediate shift to V0.5 =∼–35 mV (significantly different from KD) unless assembled with monomer D (V0.5 =∼–45 mV) (Fig. 3, A and B, top panels, and Table 1). Similarly, comparison of K and K + D channels revealed D to produce a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of steady state inactivation (from V0.5 =∼–58 mV to –71 mV) that was recapitulated by linkage-enforced 1:1 subunit association to yield KD channels (V0.5 =∼–72 mV). In contrast, KKD channels shifted to an intermediate level significantly different from KD (V0.5 =∼–64 mV) unless assembled with additional monomer D (V0.5 =∼–72 mV) (Fig. 3, A and B, middle panels, and Table 1). Moreover, the kinetic components of inactivation (fast τ, slow τ, and their weighting) modified by assembly of K with D were recapitulated in KD channels and not KKD channels (Table 1). Further, speeding of time to peak by monomer D (from 33 ms at –30 mV for K channels to 12 ms for those assembled with D subunits) was recapitulated in KD channels, whereas KKD channels showed an intermediate time course that was enhanced on assembly with additional monomer D (Fig. 3, A and B, middle panels, and Table 1). All of these findings were consistent with a 4:4 subunit ratio in naturally assembled channels. A 4:4 subunit ratio was not implied by the observation that both KD and KKD channels had rapid rates of recovery from inactivation as if just two D subunits were sufficient to produce this behavior (Table 1). Further, KKD channels assembled with monomer D failed to inactivate like K + D channels, revealing that KKD subunits did not fully recapitulate the attributes of channels formed solely with monomer subunits. KChIP2 Does Not Alter Stoichiometry Inferred by Function—The ratio of K and D subunits in naturally assembled channels appeared to be preserved in the presence of KChIP2. KChIP2 assembles with Kv4 subunits with a 4:4 ratio to produce cardiac Ito currents (15Kim L.A. Furst J. Butler M.H. Xu S. Grigorieff N. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol.

(Lond. 2005; 568: 767-788Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) suggest that neuronal ISA channels include Kv4 and DPP6 (and/or DPP10) as well as KChIPs based on their co-purification. The effects of D were therefore studied with added KChIP2. KChIP2 induces a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation of Kv4.2 channels (although less than DPP6) and a small depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of steady state inactivation (15Kim L.A. Furst J. Butler M.H. Xu S. Grigorieff N. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5549-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). KChIP2 and D assembled with K, KK, or KKD subunits decreased the hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependent activation and steady state inactivation in all cases by ∼50% while leaving accelerated time to peak unaltered (Table 1). Further, KD and K + D channels showed the same gating parameters with KChIP2 (Table 1), whereas there was a significant difference between the time to peak of KD + KChIP2 (∼13 ms) and KKD + KChIP2 (∼20 ms) channels. Amino Acid Analysis of Naturally Assembled Channels—Because KChIP2 increased the solubility (22Shibata R. Misonou H. Campomanes C.R. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A. Doliveira L.C. Carroll K.I.

Purification was achieved via antibodies to an epitope tag encoded on the Kv4.2 C terminus (Fig. 4). Thus, K, D, and KChIP2 were transiently expressed in COS7 cells, channels in the plasma membrane were cross-linked with DTBP, and immunopurification was achieved after detergent solubilization. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis confirmed co-purification of the three subunit types (Fig. 4A). Ready staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue confirmed the channel complex to be rich in the channel subunits (Fig. 4B). Other proteins that co-purified were identified by mass spectrometry to be a heat shock protein, tubulin, trypsin precursor, and actin (Fig. 4). To accurately assess the relative amounts of K and D subunits, the bands visualized by staining with dye were excised from the gel for amino acid analysis by hydrolysis, ion exchange chromatography, and ninhydrin detection (Table 2). Because the sequences of the subunits were known, expected and observed amino acid content of the bands were used to calculate the moles of each subunit from analysis of five to nine residues in five independent trials. The ratio of K:D in purified complexes was 1.1 ± 0.3 (Table 2), indicative of a 1:1 molar ratio and thus four K and four D subunits in each channel. In agreement with previous findings (4Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Amarillo Y. de Miera E.V.-S. Ma Y. Mo W. Goldberg E.M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Neubert T.A. Rudy B.

Approximately half as much D protein was recovered on purification of complexes in the absence of cross-linker (Kv4.2:DPP6, 0.44 ± 0.06, n = 5).TABLE 2Molar ratio of DPP6 and Kv4.2 subunitsExperimentKv4.2DPP6RatioPmolPmol18.46.20.74217.418.71.0733.85.81.5343.43.20.9458.27.90.96 Open table in a new tab Auxiliary subunits are an important feature in potassium channel physiology because they influence channel location, abundance, sensitivity to stimulation, and pharmacology in vivo (22Shibata R.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8246-8258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that D and K subunits assemble naturally with a stoichiometry of 4:4. Previous studies demonstrated that D increases K channel trafficking to the plasma membrane, produces a hyperpolarizing shift in both the conductance-voltage relationship and steady state inactivation, decreases time to peak, accelerates inactivation kinetics, and increases the rate of recovery from inactivation (4Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Amarillo Y. de Miera E.V.-S. Ma Y. Mo W. Goldberg E.M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Neubert T.A. Rudy B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These modulatory effects were used here to deduce the stoichiometry of channel complexes by comparing naturally assembled and engineered constructs linking K and D proteins. Thereafter, direct amino acid analysis was performed to support the inferred subunit ratio. Whereas linked KD subunits enforcing a 1:1 subunit ratio generated channel complexes that showed biophysical characteristics comparable with those of channels formed naturally, KKD subunits did not do so without additional D monomers. Four D subunits per channel were required to reproduce natural voltage-dependent activation, voltage-dependent steady state inactivation, and time to peak, whereas two were sufficient to replicate recovery from inactivation. Arguing for the trust-worthiness of linked subunits in this analysis, the same effects were observed on assembly of D with K or KK subunits (Table 1). Moreover, linkage to produce KK channels did not alter the conductance-voltage relationship, steady state inactivation voltage relationship, time to peak, nor rate of recovery from inactivation relative to K channels (Table 1). KK channels did inactivate more slowly than K channels. This was likely due to linkage of the N and C termini because deletion studies have suggested that both termini in Kv4.1 are required to confer rapid inactivation (25Jerng H.H. Covarrubias M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 163-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A similar rationale may explain small differences in inactivation rates of K + D and KD channels (Fig. 2E and Table 1). Direct biochemical analysis also supported 4:4 stoichiometry. In agreement with others (4Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Amarillo Y. de Miera E.V.-S. Ma Y. Mo W. Goldberg E.M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Neubert T.A. Rudy B.

(Lond. 2005; 568: 767-788Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we recovered more D via K isolation when cells were treated with a cross-linking agent prior to detergent solubilization. Although use of a cross-linker should arouse suspicion, studies of intact cells showed no requirement for chemical stabilization to observe similar attributes for K + D and KD channels (Table 1). This suggests that D subunit association is not dynamic or variable for channels in the plasma membrane. Disruption of membrane complexes on detergent solubilization can simply reflect destabilization in the absence of an enveloping membrane; conversely, it suggests consideration of a model with D in a lipid-exposed, peripheral location given that the single-span accessory subunit MinK is detergent-stable in complexes with KCNQ1 (13Chen H. Kim L.A. Rajan S. Xu S. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 2003; 40: 15-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and thought to be deeply intercalated/pore-associated (26Tai K.K.

Neuron. 2004; 42: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Further, the observation that KD channel surface delivery is enhanced by expression with added monomer D (Fig. 1B) leaves open the possibility that more than four DPP6 subunits are associated during intracellular channel trafficking. Although the extracellular domain of DPP6 has been crystallized and its structure has been solved (28Strop P. Bankovich A.J. Hansen K.C. Christopher Garcia K. Brunger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined how the single transmembrane domain of D is incorporated within the channel complex. Studies of DPP6 and DPP10 suggest that the transmembrane domain is important in the association with Kv4 channels (7Zagha E. Ozaita A. Chang S.Y. Nadal M.S. Lin U. Saganich M.J. McCormack T.

Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience. 2005; 29: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, DPP6 destabilized resting and intermediate states in the voltage-dependent activation pathway negatively shifting the gating charge-voltage relationship apparently via interaction of the transmembrane domain and Kv voltage-sensing and pore domains (30Dougherty K. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Another report argues for direct contact of the DPP10 transmembrane domain and S1 and/or S2 transmembrane domains of Kv4.3 subunits (29Ren X. Hayashi Y. Yoshimura N. Takimoto K. Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience. 2005; 29: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Jerng et al. (6Jerng H.H. Kunjilwar K. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Physiol. (Lond. 2005; 568: 767-788Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have suggested that neuronal ISA channels include Kv4, DPP6 (and/or DPP10), and KChIPs. In support of these findings, we also observed co-purification of the three subunit types and faster recovery from inactivation with both KChIP2 and DPP6 compared with channels with either accessory subunit alone (Table 1). Jerng et al. (6Jerng H.H. Kunjilwar K. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Physiol.

We expected to demonstrate a 1:1:1 ratio for K:D:KChIP subunits because K:KChIP channels show a 1:1 ratio in biochemical (15Kim L.A. Furst J. Butler M.H. Xu S. Grigorieff N. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol.

However, KChIP recovery on expression with K and D was twice the level expected in both the absence and presence of cross-linker (2.17 ± 0.16 and 2.05 ± 0.18, respectively, n = 4–7). We suspect this to be an artifact of the method but cannot rule out the possibility that D increases the number of KChIP subunits in channel complexes. Recovery of tubulin, actin, and heat shock protein with Kv4.2, DPP6, and KChIP2 was not unexpected. The cytoskeletal proteins have previously been isolated with Kv4 (31Petrecca K. Miller D.M.

It should be noted, however, that variability of BK channel behavior in vivo has been hypothesized to reflect assemblies with less than four auxiliary subunits based on studies of mammalian subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes (43Wang Y.-W. Ding J.P. Xia X.-M. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1550-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data do not rule out the possibility that channels with fewer than four D may form in native cells, for example, should D and K subunits be down-regulated asynchronously. However, the major mechanism by which DPP subunits augment Kv4.2 current is to increase surface delivery of channels (5Jerng H.H. Qian Y. Pfaffinger P.J. Biophys.

It seems likely, therefore, that 4:4 complexes predominate on the surface of cells producing D and K subunits and that a 4:4 arrangement is the norm for DPP subunits in assemblies with Kv pore-forming partners.

https://openalex.org/W2080346191,"Type I interferons (IFNs) play critical roles in the host defense by modulating gene expression through the IFN-dependent activation of STAT and NFkappaB transcription factors. Previous studies established that IFN activates NFkappaB through a classical NFkappaB pathway that results in IkappaBalpha degradation and formation of p50-containing NFkappaB complexes, as well as an alternative pathway that involves NFkappaB-inducing kinase and TRAF2, which results in the formation of p52-containing NFkappaB complexes. In this study, we examined the interaction of TRAF proteins with the type I IFN receptor. We found that TRAF2 was directly coupled to the signal-transducing IFNAR1 subunit of the IFN receptor. By immunoprecipitation, overexpression of epitope-tagged IFNAR1 constructs, and glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments, we demonstrate that TRAF2 rapidly binds to the IFNAR1 subunit of the IFN receptor upon IFN binding. The membrane proximal half of the IFNAR1 subunit was found to directly bind TRAF2. Moreover, analysis of mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from TRAF2 knock-out mice demonstrated that TRAF2 plays a critical role in the activation of the alternative NFkappaB pathway by IFN, but not the classical NFkappaB pathway, as well as in the antiviral action of IFN. Our results place TRAF2 directly in the signaling pathway transduced through the IFNAR1 subunit of the IFN receptor. These findings provide an important insight into the molecular mechanisms by which IFN generates signals to induce its biological effects."
https://openalex.org/W2000048997,"TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in tumor cells and holds a promise as a therapeutic agent against cancer. To elucidate the death signaling evoked by TRAIL, we performed a functional genetic screening and rescued TRAIL-resistant Jurkat clones harboring ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) cDNA in anti-sense frame. Reduction of rpS6 expression in Jurkat and HeLa cells attenuated apoptosis induced by TRAIL, but not those by other cell death signals, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and cycloheximide, etoposide, doxorubicin, tunicamycin and staurosporine. Death receptor (DR) 4, but not DR5, was downregulated in rpS6 knockdown cells. Conversely, the sensitivity to TRAIL was increased by the ectopic expression of wild-type rpS6 and further by phospho-defective rpS6 mutant (S6-SS235,6AA), but not by phospho-mimic rpS6 mutant (S6-SS235,6DD). Also, unphosphorylatable rpS6 knock-in mouse embryo fibroblasts (rpS6(P-/-) MEFs) were more sensitive to TRAIL than control MEFs. In addition, SKHep-1 tumor cells, which express less phospho-rpS6 and are more sensitive to TRAIL than other tumor cells, became effectively desensitized to TRAIL after rpS6 knockdown. These results suggest that rpS6, especially in its unphosphorylated form, is a selective mediator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2000025907,"The urokinase receptor, urokinase receptor (uPAR), is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein engaged in pericellular proteolysis and cellular adhesion, migration, and modulation of cell morphology. A direct matrix adhesion is mediated through the binding of uPAR to vitronectin, and this event is followed by downstream effects including changes in the cytoskeletal organization. However, it remains unclear whether the adhesion through uPAR-vitronectin is the only event capable of initiating these morphological rearrangements or whether lateral interactions between uPAR and integrins can induce the same response. In this report, we show that both of these triggering mechanisms can be operative and that uPAR-dependent modulation of cell morphology can indeed occur independently of a direct vitronectin binding. Expression of wild-type uPAR on HEK293 cells led to pronounced vitronectin adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangements, whereas a mutant uPAR, uPAR(W32A) with defective vitronectin binding, failed to induce both phenomena. However, upon saturation of uPAR(W32A) with the protease ligand, pro-uPA, or its receptor-binding domain, the ability to induce cytoskeletal rearrangements was restored, although this did not rescue the uPAR-vitronectin binding and adhesion capability. On the other hand, using other uPAR variants, we could show that uPAR-vitronectin adhesion is indeed capable and sufficient to induce the same morphological rearrangements. This was shown with cells expressing a different single-site mutant, uPAR(Y57A), in the presence of a synthetic uPAR-binding peptide, as well as with wild-type uPAR, which underwent cytoskeletal rearrangements even when cultivated in uPA-deficient serum. Blocking of integrins with an Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptide counteracted the matrix contacts necessary to initiate the uPAR-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements, whereas inactivation of the Rac signaling pathway in all cases suppressed the occurrence of the same events."
https://openalex.org/W1996339803,"Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) catalyzes the N-acetylation of serotonin, the penultimate step in the synthesis of melatonin. Pineal AANAT activity increases at night in all vertebrates, resulting in increased melatonin production. This increases circulating levels of melatonin, thereby providing a hormonal signal of darkness. Kinetic and structural analysis of AANAT has determined that one element is floppy. This element, termed Loop 1, is one of three loops that comprise the arylalkylamine binding pocket. During the course of chordate evolution, Loop 1 acquired the tripeptide CPL, and the enzyme became highly active. Here we focused on the functional importance of the CPL tripeptide and found that activity was markedly reduced when it was absent. Moreover, increasing the local flexibility of this tripeptide region by P64G and P64A mutations had the counterintuitive effect of reducing activity and reducing the overall movement of Loop 1, as estimated from Langevin dynamics simulations. Binding studies indicate that these mutations increased the off-rate constant of a model substrate without altering the dissociation constant. The structural kink and local rigidity imposed by Pro-64 may enhance activity by favoring configurations of Loop 1 that facilitate catalysis and do not become immobilized by intramolecular interactions."

In addition, Fas ligand is constitutively expressed in select immunoprivileged tissues such as the eye and testis. Cancer cells can harness the Fas pathway to evade immune attack (1Reichmann E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Houston A. O'Connell J. Curr. Opin.

Loss of Fas receptor function is frequently observed in human cancers, reducing the ability of infiltrating T cells and natural killer cells to kill cancerous cells (4O'Connell J. Houston A. Bennett M.W. O'Sullivan G.C. Shanahan F. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 5Houston A. Waldron-Lynch F.D. Bennett M.W. Roche D. O'Sullivan G.C. Shanahan F.

Friese K. Thiesen H.J. Gerber B. Breast Cancer Res. 2002; 4: R9Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Modulation of Fas signaling for selective survival advantage has been documented in multiple tumor types, including colon, hepatocellular, ovarian and esophageal carcinomas, melanoma, and astrocytoma (1Reichmann E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Loss of Fas signaling by cancer cells is accomplished at the molecular level by transcriptional down-regulation of Fas receptor or the adaptor protein Fas-associated protein with death domain and up-regulation of negative regulatory components of the Fas pathway such as FLICE-like inhibitory protein, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2 (2Houston A. O'Connell J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, many cancer cells also up-regulate Fas ligand expression, which consequently results in increased T cell apoptosis and decreased infiltration (9Ryan A.E. Shanahan F. O'Connell J. Houston A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9817-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Bennett M.W. O'Connell J. Houston A. Kelly J. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Clin. Pathol.

Cancer. 2003; 89: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of the molecular pathways modulating Fas signaling is an important goal in rational drug development that targets this adaptive strategy of cancer cells. We have recently shown that intracellular calcium homeostasis is critical to the progression of apoptotic cell death. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) 2The abbreviations used are: IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; BAPTA-AM, aminomethoxy ester form of BAPTA; XestC, Xestospongin C; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; RNAi, RNA interference. 2The abbreviations used are: IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; BAPTA-AM, aminomethoxy ester form of BAPTA; XestC, Xestospongin C; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; RNAi, RNA interference. calcium channels regulate intracellular calcium concentration during apoptosis induced by death receptor ligation (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and cellular damage (13Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Apoptosis-specific signaling via IP3R is mediated by cytochrome c, which binds to the channel after being released from mitochondria, resulting in augmented channel function (13Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). This ultimately leads to cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium overload and cell death. Fas receptor signaling utilizes cytochrome c release from mitochondria to amplify the apoptotic signal (14Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2607) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibiting IP3R-dependent apoptotic signaling in lymphocytes would protect them from apoptotic cell death induced by tumor cells expressing high levels of Fas ligand. In this report, we show that inhibiting IP3R function in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells is cytoprotective against apoptosis induced by co-culture with Fas ligand-expressing SW620 colon cancer cells. The IP3R antagonist xestospongin C (XestC) and calcium buffering with BAPTA dose-dependently inhibited Jurkat cell apoptosis. Inhibiting exclusively IP3R activation due to proapoptotic signaling in lymphocytes by blocking cytochrome c binding to IP3R inhibited lymphocyte death with nanomolar affinity. Thus, specifically targeting proapopotic signaling through the IP3R in lymphocytes appears to be a promising therapeutic approach for enhancing tumor cell immunogenicity. Materials—Peptide synthesis of the IP3R fragment encoding the cytochrome c binding domain of the type I IP3R isoform and conjugation to BODIPY-577/618 has been described elsewhere (15Boehning D. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This cell-permeant peptide is termed B-IP3RCYT. The aminomethoxy ester form of BAPTA (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; BAPTA-AM), propidium iodide, and fura-2-AM were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). XestC and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture—Jurkat T-lymphoma (clone E6-1) and SW620 colon adenocarcinoma cells were purchased and cultured according to the guidelines of American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). SW620 cells grow as adherent monolayers, whereas Jurkat cells grow in suspension. Jurkat cells were co-cultured with SW620 cells by exchanging the culture medium of SW620 cells (80% confluent in a 10-cm dish) with 10 ml of Jurkat medium containing 1 × 106 Jurkat cells. Co-cultures were incubated for 24 h, after which cell death or caspase activity was determined in Jurkat cells. Preloading BAPTA or B-IP3RCYT into Jurkat cells was performed for 30 min at room temperature. Free BAPTA-AM or B-IP3RCYT were removed by medium exchange prior to addition to SW620 cells. XestC was similarly preincubated with Jurkat cells prior to co-culturing and remained in the culture medium for the duration of the co-culture experiment. RNAi—Knockdown of the human IP3R-1 in Jurkat cells and rescue with the rat IP3R-1 isoform was done exactly as described elsewhere (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The rat itpr1 gene has several base substitutions within the targeted region of the human ITPR1 gene allowing expression in the presence of this RNAi. Control experiments utilized an RNAi with several deletions and insertions (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was utilized to identify cells containing the RNAi for calcium imaging and cell death assays (described below). Calcium Imaging—SW620 cells grown on coverslips were loaded with fura-2-AM for 30 min at room temperature. Jurkat cells were loaded in suspension as described (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Coverslips with fura-2-loaded SW620 cells were placed in an imaging chamber (Attofluor® cell chamber, Molecular Probes) and imaged at ×40 magnification as described (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fura-2-loaded Jurkat cells (∼1 × 104) were added by solution exchange. In ∼20% of trials (6 of 28), a Jurkat cell came into direct contact with one or more SW620 cells in the field of view. To measure responses in Jurkat cells co-transfected with RNAi and YFP, images were acquired with a ×20 objective, and ∼5 × 104 Jurkat cells were added to the imaging chamber containing SW620 cells. This methodology permitted imaging of the low abundance transfected Jurkat cells contacting SW620 cells with greater frequency at the expense of resolution. RNAi data are expressed as a histogram of the percentage of responding YFP-positive cells from a minimum of 15 cells, which were confirmed to directly contact an SW620 cell. A response was defined as an increase in 340/380 ratio greater than 0.5. Caspase-3 Activity and Cell Death Determination—Caspase activity and cell death were determined specifically in Jurkat cells by removing the medium containing the Jurkat cells into a fresh tube. An additional rinse with culture medium was used to fully recover the Jurkat cells. Adherent SW620 cells remained attached to the culture plate after this rinse as determined by light microscopy. Jurkat cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g, and cell death was determined by propidium iodide staining as described (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fluorometric determination of DEVDase (caspase-3 like) activity was performed on lysates prepared from Jurkat cells as described (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Boehning D. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by using unpaired two-tailed t tests on data points from at least three separate experiments. Data comparisons were considered significant if p was <0.05. SW620 colon carcinoma cells express high levels of Fas ligand and have been shown to be potent inducers of Jurkat apoptosis in a Fas-dependent manner (16O'Connell J. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that co-culture of Jurkat cells with SW620 cells would induce proapoptotic calcium release in Jurkat cells and that this calcium release would be required for lymphocyte apoptosis. To monitor intracellular calcium in co-culture experiments, SW620 cells were grown on coverslips and loaded with fura-2. Jurkat cells were also separately loaded with fura-2 to simultaneously image intracellular calcium in both cell types. After establishing baseline calcium levels in SW620 cells, Jurkat cells were added to the imaging chamber by solution exchange. In 6 of 28 trials, a Jurkat cell bound directly to one or more SW620 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, upon binding SW620 cells, a large transient rise in intracellular calcium is induced in Jurkat cells. Interestingly, after a short delay, calcium oscillations are induced in SW620 cells (Fig. 1, A and C). The functional significance of these oscillations in SW620 cells are unclear, but this finding is of significance since coupling of Fas ligand to calcium release in Fas ligand-presenting cells has not been demonstrated. Fas ligand microvesicles can induce calcium release in Jurkat cells via IP3R calcium channels (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Boehning D. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine whether the calcium response in Jurkat cells was due to IP3R-mediated calcium release, we knocked down IP3R levels with a previously characterized double-stranded RNAi oligonucleotide targeting the human IP3R-1 isoform (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Knockdown of IP3R-1 completely abrogated Jurkat calcium release in response to SW620 cell binding (0/15 cells; Fig. 1D). Importantly, calcium release could be rescued by co-transfecting the rat itpr1 cDNA (9/18 cells). As expected, Jurkat cells expressing control RNAi retained the ability to release calcium after contact with SW620 cells (10/16 cells). These results indicate that binding to SW620 cells induces IP3R-dependent calcium release in Jurkat cells. To examine the effects of modulators of IP3R-dependent calcium release on SW620-dependent Jurkat apoptosis, we monitored caspase-3 activation. As expected, co-culture of Jurkat cells with SW620 cells induced significant activation of caspase-3 in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1E;#, p < 0.05 relative to Jurkat cells, which were not co-cultured with SW620 cells). To determine whether intracellular calcium contributed to this increase in caspase-3 activity, we loaded Jurkat cells with various concentrations of the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM to buffer cytosolic calcium levels. Significant attenuation of caspase-3 activation was observed by incubating the cells with 100 and 500 nm BAPTA-AM (*, p < 0.05 relative to Jurkat cells co-cultured with SW620 cells without pretreatment). To determine whether the IP3R is required for lymphocyte apoptosis, we incubated cells with various doses of the cell-permeant IP3R inhibitor XestC, a selective blocker of IP3R function when used at low micromolar concentrations (17Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 18Ta T.A. Feng W. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). XestC inhibited caspase-3 activation in Jurkat cells at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 micromolar, indicating that IP3R activity was required for caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1E). Importantly, XestC potently blocked Jurkat cell death induced by coculture with SW620 cells (Fig. 1F). During apoptosis, calcium release from IP3R is augmented by direct binding of cytochrome c to the channel (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat.

A. 2005; 102: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c binds to the cytosolic C-terminal “tail” of the IP3R, decreasing the ability of calcium to inhibit the channel and prolonging calcium release (15Boehning D. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Peptides derived from the cytochrome c binding domain of IP3R, when introduced into cells, inhibit calcium-dependent apoptosis without altering agonist-induced calcium release (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 15Boehning D. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Coupling of one of these peptides to the hydrophobic dye BODIPY 577/618 renders the peptide cell permeant, retaining antiapoptotic activity (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Boehning D. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether this peptide, termed B-IP3RCYT, could block SW620-dependent cell death of Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig. 1E, B-IP3RCYT inhibited caspase-3 activation in Jurkat cells at nanomolar concentrations. This result is consistent with the in vitro observation that IP3RCYT has a higher affinity for cytochrome c than the cytosolic tail of IP3R and can inhibit Fas-dependent cell death induced by Fas ligand microvesicles or the cytotoxic drug staurosporine at nanomolar concentrations (15Boehning D. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Importantly, the B-IP3RCYT peptide also inhibited Jurkat cell death induced by SW620 co-culture (Fig. 1F). Thus, specifically blocking apoptotic calcium release via the IP3R inhibits lymphocyte apoptosis induced by Fas ligand-expressing cancer cells. Finally, RNAi-mediated knockdown of IP3R-1 also inhibited Jurkat cell death, and these effects were reversed by rescue with the rat itpr1 cDNA (Fig. 1F). The ability of tumor cells to attain immunoprivileged status in vivo by up-regulating Fas ligand has remained relatively controversial (9Ryan A.E. Shanahan F. O'Connell J. Houston A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9817-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Houston A. Bennett M.W. O'Sullivan G.C. Shanahan F. O'Connell J. Br. J.

In this report, we demonstrate in vitro that Fas-dependent killing of a lymphocyte cell line by cancer cells requires calcium release from IP3R. Identification of the IP3Ras a mediator of lymphocyte apoptosis induced by a tumor cells highlights a novel Fas-dependent pathway that warrants further investigation in vivo (Fig. 2). Significantly, we found that lymphocyte apoptosis could be inhibited by specifically blocking apoptotic calcium release from IP3R. Lymphocyte apoptosis was inhibited by B-IP3RCYT when placed in the culture medium at low nanomolar concentrations. Since B-IP3RCYT exhibits no significant cellular toxicity and does not modify agonist-induced calcium release (12Wozniak A.L. Wang X. Stieren E.S. Scarbrough S.G. Elferink C.J. Boehning D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Boehning D. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), targeting IP3R/cytochrome c interactions appears to be an attractive target for enhancing the immunologic response of tumors that have acquired adaptive changes in death receptor signaling to promote survival.

https://openalex.org/W2003337548,"Focal complexes are continuously formed and transformed into focal adhesions during cell movement. We previously demonstrated that Necl-5 co-localizes with integrin αVβ3 at focal complexes, whereas Necl-5 does not localize at focal adhesions in moving NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that Necl-5 may be dissociated from integrin αVβ3 during the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we explore the roles of Necl-5 and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) in the regulation of the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions. We found that inhibition of Necl-5 expression and expression of a constitutively active mutant of ROCK1 enhanced, whereas treatment with a ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 inhibited the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions. In HEK293 cells ectopically expressing Necl-5 and integrin αVβ3, treatment of cells with Y-27632 increased the binding of Necl-5 to clustered integrin αVβ3. The experiments using inhibitors of myosin ATPase and actin polymerization revealed that actomyosin-driven contractility exerts a similar function as ROCK. The phosphorylation of integrin β3 at Tyr747, which is known to be critical for the formation of focal adhesions, plays a pivotal role for the interaction between Necl-5 and integrin αVβ3. These results indicate that the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions is negatively and positively regulated by Necl-5 and ROCK, respectively, and that ROCK-dependent actomyosin-driven contractility is a critical determinant for the regulation of the interaction between Necl-5 and integrin αVβ3.

Cell movement has a pivotal role for physiological processes such as morphogenesis during development and the mobilization of immune cells to sites of infection as well as pathological events including metastasis of cancer cells. While moving in the direction of increasing or decreasing concentrations of external signaling molecules, cells spatiotemporally form special structures at leading edges, which include protrusions such as filopodia and lamellipodia, ruffles, focal complexes, and focal adhesions. Continuous formation and disassembly of these leading edge structures are necessary for facilitating cells to keep moving. Cells adhere to the extracellular matrix via integrins, cell-matrix adhesion molecules which regulate cell movement and exert their regulatory functions in cooperation with cell surface receptors for chemoattractants. Focal complexes are small dot-like integrin adhesion complexes formed at the edges of lamellipodia (1Nobes C.D. Hall A. Biochem. Soc.

Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). After binding to matrix, integrins recruit cytoskeletal and cytoplasmic proteins, which leads to the cytoskeletal remodeling and the formation of more stable adhesive structures called focal adhesions. Focal adhesions contain proteins such as Src and focal adhesion kinase, integrin β3, vinculin, and paxillin, and tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins is implicated in the formation and turnover of focal adhesions (for review, see Refs. 4Carragher N.O.

Acta. 2004; 1692: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, including actin polymerization and stress fiber formation, is required for cell spreading and locomotion and plays a central role in the formation of leading edge structures. During the migration process, the maturation of small focal complexes to larger focal adhesions at the leading edges requires the tension provided by actomyosin-driven contractility (for review, see Ref. 6Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar).Rho family small G proteins play a central role in the regulation of the formation of leading edge structures, cytoskeletal dynamics, and the maturation of focal complexes to focal adhesions (3Rottner K.

Rac1 triggers the formation of lamellipodia, ruffles, and focal complexes. Cdc42 is critical for the formation of filopodia and focal complexes.

The transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions depends on the activation of RhoA and its effector Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) 2The abbreviations used are: ROCK, Rho-associated kinase; CA, constitutively active; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; BDM, 2,3-butanedione monoxime; Nef-3, a recombinant extracellular fragment of nectin-3 fused to the human IgG Fc; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. 2The abbreviations used are: ROCK, Rho-associated kinase; CA, constitutively active; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; BDM, 2,3-butanedione monoxime; Nef-3, a recombinant extracellular fragment of nectin-3 fused to the human IgG Fc; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. and is negatively regulated by Cdc42 and Rac1. It has been shown that ROCK is involved in the stress fiber formation (9Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) and regulates the contractility required for the cytoskeletal reorganization by two mechanisms, directly by the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (10Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) and indirectly by the inactivation of myosin phosphatase through the phosphorylation of the myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (11Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Although the ROCK-mediated actin-myosin-driven contractility is likely involved in the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions, the molecular mechanism by which ROCK regulates this process remains largely unknown.We previously reported that Necl-5, an immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecule, also termed as poliovirus receptor/CD155/Tage4, co-localizes with integrin αVβ3 at the leading edges in moving NIH3T3 cells and enhances cell movement (12Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18015-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We recently showed that Necl-5 forms a complex with integrin αvβ3, and overexpression of Necl-5 enhances its clustering. This results in the augmentation of the formation of focal complexes under peripheral ruffles over lamellipodia at the leading edges of NIH3T3 cells which are cultured on dishes pre-coated with vitronectin, known as an extracellular matrix for integrin αvβ3 (13van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and directionally stimulated by PDGF. Over-expression of Necl-5 reduces the formation of focal adhesions, where integrin αvβ3, but not Necl-5, is concentrated (14Minami Y. Ikeda W. Kajita M. Fujito T. Amano H. Tamaru Y. Kuramitsu K. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18481-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Necl-5 enhances the formation of focal complexes and suggest that Necl-5 may negatively regulate the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions and that Necl-5 may be dissociated from integrin αvβ3 during this transformation. Knockdown of Necl-5 decreased the formation of focal complexes and focal adhesions (14Minami Y. Ikeda W. Kajita M. Fujito T. Amano H. Tamaru Y. Kuramitsu K. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18481-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This result emphasizes that Necl-5 is required for the formation of focal complexes and suggests that focal complexes may be needed for their transformation into focal adhesions. Therefore, we explored here the roles of Necl-5 and ROCK in the regulation of the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid—Expression vectors for wild-type human integrin αV and human integrin β3 (pcDNA3-αV and pcDNA3-β3) were kindly provided from Dr. J.

Y-27632, 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) (Calbiochem), calyculin A (Alexis Biochemicals), and cytochalasin D (Biomol) were obtained from commercial sources.Down-regulation of Necl-5—A recombinant extracellular fragment of nectin-3 fused to the human IgG Fc (Nef-3) that efficiently interacts with Necl-5 was used to induce down-regulation of Necl-5 from the cell surface (15Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Nef-3 was prepared as described previously (19Honda T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Yasumi M. Shingai T. Fukuhara A. Ozaki-Kuroda K. Irie K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and cross-linked by the goat anti-human IgG Fc pAb (Jackson Immuno Research) before use. NIH3T3 cells were sparsely plated on dishes, cultured in the serum-containing medium in the presence or absence of Nef-3 for 18 h, washed, re-plated on vitronectin-coated glass coverslips, and then cultured in the serum-containing medium in the absence of Nef-3 for 6 h. In another series of experiments, NIH3T3 cells were sparsely plated on vitronectin-coated glass coverslips, cultured in the serum-containing medium for 18 h, and then cultured in the serum-containing medium in the presence or absence of Nef-3 for 1 h.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1), incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then incubated with 20% BlockAce (Dainihon Sumitomo Seiyaku) in PBS (15Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The samples were stained with various combinations of the primary Abs and then with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary Abs. Fluorescence signals were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopes (LSM510 META, Carl Zeiss; Digital Eclipse C1si-ready, Nikon).Cell Surface Biotinylation—To analyze the cell surface expression of Necl-5 and integrin αVβ3, cells were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido) ethyl-dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin) (Pierce) in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min and washed by sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin blocking reagent (50 mm NH4Cl in PBS) to quench free sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin followed by several further washes in PBS. Cells were then frozen by liquid N2, scraped off, and lysed in 500 μl of IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μm 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride). Cell extracts were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and then divided into a detergent-insoluble pellet and a detergent-soluble supernatant by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with streptavidin beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 4 h to collect biotinylated proteins. These samples were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting.Directional Stimulation with PDGF—To generate a concentration gradient of PDGF, a μ-Slide VI flow (uncoated; Ibidi) was used (14Minami Y. Ikeda W. Kajita M. Fujito T. Amano H. Tamaru Y. Kuramitsu K. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18481-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, the μ-Slide VI flow has six parallel channels which were coated with 5 μg/ml vitronectin according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells per square centimeter, cultured for 16 h, and starved of serum with DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The concentration gradient of PDGF was applied using DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 30 ng/ml PDGF for 30 min according to the manufacturer's protocol.Time-lapse Fluorescence Microscopy—Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy was performed as follows. NIH3T3 cells transfected with pEGFP-N3-integrin β3 or co-transfected with pEGFP-N3-integrin β3 and pBS-H1-Necl-5 were sparsely plated on vitronectin-coated glass-bottomed dishes, cultured in the serum-containing medium for 18 h, and then cultured in DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of Y-27632 for 1 h. An aliquot of PDGF was applied to the area close to the periphery of cells. Fluorescence signals were visualized by a confocal laser scanning microscope (Digital Eclipse C1si-ready, Nikon), and images were recorded in intervals of 1 min.Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described (14Minami Y. Ikeda W. Kajita M. Fujito T. Amano H. Tamaru Y. Kuramitsu K. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18481-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, HEK293 cells were transfected with various combinations of plasmids, plated on vitronectin-coated dishes, and cultured overnight. After a 1-h serum starvation or treatment with each reagent, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μm 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride). In some experiments, NIH3T3 cells, instead of HEK293 cells, were sparsely plated vitronectin-coated dishes and cultured overnight. After a 1-h serum starvation or treatment with Y-27632, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and treated with 2 mm 3,3′-dithiobis-sulfosuccinimidyl propionate (DTSSP, Pierce) in PBS for 2 h. After the addition of Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with buffer A. The lysates were rotated for 30 min and subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. In the experiments using HEK293 cells, the supernatant was preincubated with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads pre-bound to the anti-FLAG mAb at 4 °C for 4 h. In the experiments using NIH3T3 cells, the supernatant was preincubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h and incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads pre-bound to the anti-integrin αV pAb at 4 °C for 4 h. After the beads were extensively washed with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting.RESULTSInhibition by Necl-5 of the Transformation of Focal Complexes into Focal Adhesions—We first examined whether Necl-5 is needed for the formation of focal complexes as well as whether the formation of focal complexes is required for the formation of focal adhesions. For this purpose, we used Nef-3 (the extracellular fragment of nectin-3 fused to the Fc portion of IgG) that trans-interacts with Necl-5 and induces its down-regulation from the cell surface (15Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When NIH3T3 cells, which were sparsely plated on dishes and cultured in the serum-containing medium for 18 h, were re-plated on vitronectin-coated glass coverslips and then cultured in the medium containing serum for 6 h, most cells formed polarized structures with lamellipodia at the leading edges, consistent with our earlier observations (Figs. 1, Aa and 1Ba) (12Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18015-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Minami Y. Ikeda W. Kajita M. Fujito T. Amano H. Tamaru Y. Kuramitsu K. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18481-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The immunofluorescence signal for phosphotyrosine, an excellent marker for focal complexes and focal adhesions (20Zaidel-Bar R. Ballestrem C. Kam Z. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4605-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), was observed as dot-like structures under the peripheral ruffles and at sites to the rear of the leading edges. The dot-like structures under the peripheral ruffles were smaller in size than those at sites to the rear of the leading edges. These smaller dot-like structures under the peripheral ruffles corresponded to focal complexes, whereas larger dot-like structures at sites to the rear of the leading edges corresponded to focal adhesions. The signals for integrin β3 and Necl-5 were concentrated and co-localized with the signal for phosphotyrosine at focal complexes. In addition, the signal for integrin β3, but not that for Necl-5, was concentrated and co-localized with the signal for phosphotyrosine at focal adhesions. Essentially the same results were obtained when integrin αv was stained instead of integrin β3. 3Y. Nagamatsu, Y. Rikitake, M. Takahashi, Y. Deki, W. Ikeda, K.-i. Hirata, and Y. Takai, unpublished data. Indeed, unless otherwise specified, essentially identical results were obtained for both integrin αv and integrin β3 in the experiments that follow. In NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Necl-5 (Necl-5-NIH3T3 cells), most of the signals for phosphotyrosine, integrin β3, and Necl-5 were seen at focal complexes, and only faint signals were observed at focal adhesions (Fig. 1Ab), consistent with our earlier results (14Minami Y. Ikeda W. Kajita M. Fujito T. Amano H. Tamaru Y. Kuramitsu K. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18481-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we determined that the smaller dot-like structures observed under the peripheral ruffles, which were immunopositive for Necl-5, integrin αv, integrin β3, and phosphotyrosine, corresponded to focal complexes, whereas the relatively larger dot-like structures, which were immunopositive for integrin αv, integrin β3, and phosphotyrosine, but not for Necl-5, corresponded to focal adhesions. However, when wild-type NIH3T3 cells, which were sparsely plated on dishes and cultured in the serum-containing medium in the presence of Nef-3 for 18 h, were re-plated on vitronectin-coated glass coverslips and then cultured in the medium containing serum, but not Nef-3, for 6 h, most cells did not form polarized structures with lamellipodia (Fig. 1Bb). The signals for Necl-5 and integrin β3 were hardly detected at any peripheral regions. The signal for integrin β3 was markedly reduced, but the signal for vinculin, another marker for focal adhesions, was clearly observed, indicating that integrin β3-positive focal adhesions were reduced, but vinculin-positive focal adhesions were definitely formed. When cells were co-incubated with the anti-Necl-5 mAb that inhibits the interaction of Nef-3 with Necl-5 (15Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the effect of Nef-3 was absent; the signals for Necl-5 and integrin β3 were concentrated and co-localized at focal complexes, which was similar to those in cells untreated with Nef-3 (Fig. 1Bc). A biotinylation assay showed that Nef-3 decreased the amount of cell surface Necl-5 but did not affect the amount of cell surface integrin αv or integrin β3, indicating that integrin αv and integrin β3 remained on the cell surface without being endocytosed (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that when the amount of cell surface Necl-5 is reduced by down-regulation, the formation of both focal complexes and focal adhesions are markedly reduced.We then examined whether Necl-5 inhibits the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions. When NIH3T3 cells were sparsely plated on vitronectin-coated glass coverslips and cultured in the presence of serum for 19 h, many cells formed polarized structures with protrusive lamellipodia at the leading edges (Fig. 1Da). However, when cells were sparsely plated on vitronectin-coated glass coverslips and cultured for 18 h and then incubated with Nef-3 for 1 h, they did not form polarized structures with lamellipodia. The signals for Necl-5 and integrin β3 were hardly observed at any peripheral regions (Fig. 1Db). The signal for integrin β3 was concentrated at focal adhesions and markedly increased in comparison with that in cells cultured without Nef-3. The signal for Necl-5 was not observed at focal adhesions. Furthermore, when cells were co-incubated with the anti-Necl-5 mAb, the effect of Nef-3 was cancelled; the signals for Necl-5 and integrin β3 were concentrated and co-localized at focal complexes (Fig. 1Dc). The amounts of integrin αv and integrin β3 remained unchanged by Nef-3 despite the reduction of the amount of Necl-5 (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that when Necl-5 is down-regulated by Nef-3 treatment after both focal complexes and focal adhesions are formed, the Nef-3-induced down-regulation of Necl-5 disassembles the clustering of integrin αvβ3 at focal complexes. This leads to diminish focal complexes but enhances focal adhesion formation. We applied another approach, the RNA interference method, to confirm the results of the experiment using Nef-3. We successfully knocked down Necl-5 by the use of Necl-5 siRNA without silencing integrin αvβ3 expression (Fig. 1F). Necl-5-knockdown cells did not form polarized structures with lamellipodia, and the signal for integrin β3 was reduced (see Fig. 1Bb); however, this phenotype was reversed by an expression of a GFP-tagged siRNA-resistant mutant of Necl-5 (GFP-Necl-5R) (Fig. 1G, a and b). Taken together, these results indicate that Necl-5 inhibits the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions and suggest that Necl-5 is dissociated from integrin αvβ3 during this transformation.Inhibition of the Transformation of Focal Complexes into Focal Adhesions by a ROCK Inhibitor—To examine whether ROCK activation is necessary for the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions during directional cell movement, cells were sparsely plated on μ-slide VI flow dishes pre-coated with vitronectin, starved of serum, and directionally stimulated by PDGF in the presence or absence of a ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. In the absence of Y-27632, most cells became polarized and formed lamellipodia with peripheral ruffles at the leading edges toward higher concentrations of PDGF. The immunofluorescence signals for Necl-5 and integrin β3 were concentrated and co-localized at peripheral ruffles of the leading edges in the middle section of the cells (results not shown), consistent with our earlier observations (12Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol.

In the basal section of the cells, the signals for Necl-5 and integrin β3 were observed at focal complexes under peripheral ruffles (Fig. 2A). In the presence of Y-27632, however, the signal for integrin β3 was enhanced and accumu"
