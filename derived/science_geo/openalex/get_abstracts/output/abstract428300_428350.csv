https://openalex.org/W2075608977,"Living organisms have unique homeostatic abilities, maintaining tight control of their local environment through interconversions of chemical and mechanical energy and self-regulating feedback loops organized hierarchically across many length scales. In contrast, most synthetic materials are incapable of continuous self-monitoring and self-regulating behaviour owing to their limited single-directional chemomechanical or mechanochemical modes. Applying the concept of homeostasis to the design of autonomous materials would have substantial impacts in areas ranging from medical implants that help stabilize bodily functions to 'smart' materials that regulate energy usage. Here we present a versatile strategy for creating self-regulating, self-powered, homeostatic materials capable of precisely tailored chemo-mechano-chemical feedback loops on the nano- or microscale. We design a bilayer system with hydrogel-supported, catalyst-bearing microstructures, which are separated from a reactant-containing 'nutrient' layer. Reconfiguration of the gel in response to a stimulus induces the reversible actuation of the microstructures into and out of the nutrient layer, and serves as a highly precise 'on/off' switch for chemical reactions. We apply this design to trigger organic, inorganic and biochemical reactions that undergo reversible, repeatable cycles synchronized with the motion of the microstructures and the driving external chemical stimulus. By exploiting a continuous feedback loop between various exothermic catalytic reactions in the nutrient layer and the mechanical action of the temperature-responsive gel, we then create exemplary autonomous, self-sustained homeostatic systems that maintain a user-defined parameter--temperature--in a narrow range. The experimental results are validated using computational modelling that qualitatively captures the essential features of the self-regulating behaviour and provides additional criteria for the optimization of the homeostatic function, subsequently confirmed experimentally. This design is highly customizable owing to the broad choice of chemistries, tunable mechanics and its physical simplicity, and may lead to a variety of applications in autonomous systems with chemo-mechano-chemical transduction at their core."
https://openalex.org/W2022082745,"Chronic stress is a strong diathesis for depression in humans and is used to generate animal models of depression. It commonly leads to several major symptoms of depression, including dysregulated feeding behaviour, anhedonia and behavioural despair. Although hypotheses defining the neural pathophysiology of depression have been proposed, the critical synaptic adaptations in key brain circuits that mediate stress-induced depressive symptoms remain poorly understood. Here we show that chronic stress in mice decreases the strength of excitatory synapses on D1 dopamine receptor-expressing nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons owing to activation of the melanocortin 4 receptor. Stress-elicited increases in behavioural measurements of anhedonia, but not increases in measurements of behavioural despair, are prevented by blocking these melanocortin 4 receptor-mediated synaptic changes in vivo. These results establish that stress-elicited anhedonia requires a neuropeptide-triggered, cell-type-specific synaptic adaptation in the nucleus accumbens and that distinct circuit adaptations mediate other major symptoms of stress-elicited depression. Stress-induced behavioural measures of anhedonia in adult mice, but not measures of behavioural despair, required a decrease in the strength of excitatory synapses on D1 dopamine receptor-expressing nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons owing to activation of melanocortin 4 receptors. Chronic stress is known to lead to symptoms of depression, such as an inability to feel pleasure (anhedonia), abnormal eating habits and behavioural despair, but the synaptic adaptations involved in the various symptoms are not well understood. This study in mice shows that stress decreases the strength of excitatory synapses onto D1 dopamine-receptor-expressing neurons in the nucleus accumbens, part of the brain associated with pleasure and reward-seeking behaviour, through activation of melanocortin 4 receptors. Blocking these receptors prevents the effects of stress on feeding and cocaine-reward responses, but not behavioural despair. These results provide evidence of a dissociation between the neural circuits that mediate different symptoms of depression, suggesting that it should be possible to develop therapies targeting specific behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2102021831,"Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing have brought the vision of personal genomics and genomic medicine closer to reality. However, current methods lack clinical accuracy and the ability to describe the context (haplotypes) in which genome variants co-occur in a cost-effective manner. Here we describe a low-cost DNA sequencing and haplotyping process, long fragment read (LFR) technology, which is similar to sequencing long single DNA molecules without cloning or separation of metaphase chromosomes. In this study, ten LFR libraries were made using only ∼100 picograms of human DNA per sample. Up to 97% of the heterozygous single nucleotide variants were assembled into long haplotype contigs. Removal of false positive single nucleotide variants not phased by multiple LFR haplotypes resulted in a final genome error rate of 1 in 10 megabases. Cost-effective and accurate genome sequencing and haplotyping from 10–20 human cells, as demonstrated here, will enable comprehensive genetic studies and diverse clinical applications. A new DNA analysis method termed long fragment read technology is described, and the approach is used to determine parental haplotypes and to sequence human genomes cost-effectively and accurately from only 10 to 20 cells. Many of the hoped-for advances in the field of personalized medicine are dependent on the development of low-cost genome-sequencing technology that combines clinical accuracy with the ability to describe the context (the genetic haplotype) in which variants occur on an individual chromosome. The technique described here, termed long-fragment read technology, is similar to that used to sequence long single DNA molecules, but without DNA cloning or chromosome separation. The authors demonstrate the potential of this approach by generating seven accurate human genome sequences, as well as haplotype data, from samples containing just 10–20 cells. This advance shows that it should be possible to achieve clinical quality and scale in personal genome sequencing of microbiopsies and circulating cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2135606595,"DNA synthesis has been extensively studied, but the chemical reaction itself has not been visualized. Here we follow the course of phosphodiester bond formation using time-resolved X-ray crystallography. Native human DNA polymerase η, DNA and dATP were co-crystallized at pH 6.0 without Mg2+. The polymerization reaction was initiated by exposing crystals to 1 mM Mg2+ at pH 7.0, and stopped by freezing at desired time points for structural analysis. The substrates and two Mg2+ ions are aligned within 40 s, but the bond formation is not evident until 80 s. From 80 to 300 s structures show a mixture of decreasing substrate and increasing product of the nucleotidyl-transfer reaction. Transient electron densities indicate that deprotonation and an accompanying C2′-endo to C3′-endo conversion of the nucleophile 3′-OH are rate limiting. A third Mg2+ ion, which arrives with the new bond and stabilizes the intermediate state, may be an unappreciated feature of the two-metal-ion mechanism. Atomic-resolution time courses of phosphodiester bond formation catalysed by DNA polymerase η reveal transient intermediate states and an unexpected third metal ion in the reaction mechanism. Chemists would like to be able to determine the structures of true transition states in chemical reactions, but the high energy and unstable nature of transition states had made this goal unattainable. Using a repair reaction catalysed by DNA polymerase η (Pol η) as their model, Wei Yang and colleagues have extended the use of flash–freeze technology to observe DNA synthesis in real time and at atomic resolution using X-ray crystallography to analyse the trapped covalent intermediates. Pol η is particularly well suited to this approach because it has a slow rate of reaction and a relatively rigid catalytic centre. The observed reaction intermediates reveal several unanticipated transient states, and implicate an unexpected third magnesium ion in the reaction mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2093466133,"Production of the cytokine receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) by lymphocytes has been proposed as a mechanism by which sex steroid deficiency causes bone loss. However, there have been no studies that functionally link RANKL expression in lymphocytes with bone loss in this condition. Herein, we examined whether RANKL expression in either B or T lymphocytes contributes to ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice. Mice harboring a conditional RANKL allele were crossed with CD19-Cre or Lck-Cre mice to delete RANKL in B or T lymphocytes, respectively. Deletion of RANKL from either cell type had no impact on bone mass in estrogen-replete mice up to 7 months of age. However, mice lacking RANKL in B lymphocytes were partially protected from the bone loss caused by ovariectomy. This protection occurred in cancellous, but not cortical, bone and was associated with a failure to increase osteoclast numbers in the conditional knock-out mice. Deletion of RANKL from T lymphocytes had no impact on ovariectomy-induced bone loss. These results demonstrate that lymphocyte RANKL is not involved in basal bone remodeling, but B cell RANKL does contribute to the increase in osteoclasts and cancellous bone loss that occurs after loss of estrogen.

https://openalex.org/W1990136463,"A simulation of ice sheet retreat reveals two meltwater pulses coinciding with MWP-1A and the ‘8,200-year’ event, caused by saddle collapses between ice domes. During the last deglaciation, the retreating ice sheets occasionally released massive amounts of fresh water. These 'meltwater pulses' are often implicated as important influences on abrupt climate change, but the underlying triggering mechanisms are not clear. Here Lauren Gregoire et al. show that 'saddle zones' that connect adjacent high domes on ice sheets can be lowered by ongoing warming to an elevation at which they rapidly degrade, leading to separate domes and a meltwater pulse that is consistent with geological observations. Although the mechanism itself is not novel, the authors establish that two important sudden-cooling events — meltwater pulse 1A and the '8,200-year' event — were probably caused by saddle separation. The last deglaciation (21 to 7 thousand years ago) was punctuated by several abrupt meltwater pulses, which sometimes caused noticeable climate change1,2. Around 14 thousand years ago, meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), the largest of these events, produced a sea level rise of 14–18 metres over 350 years3. Although this enormous surge of water certainly originated from retreating ice sheets, there is no consensus on the geographical source or underlying physical mechanisms governing the rapid sea level rise4,5,6. Here we present an ice-sheet modelling simulation in which the separation of the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets in North America produces a meltwater pulse corresponding to MWP-1A. Another meltwater pulse is produced when the Labrador and Baffin ice domes around Hudson Bay separate, which could be associated with the ‘8,200-year’ event, the most pronounced abrupt climate event of the past nine thousand years7. For both modelled pulses, the saddle between the two ice domes becomes subject to surface melting because of a general surface lowering caused by climate warming. The melting then rapidly accelerates as the saddle between the two domes gets lower, producing nine metres of sea level rise over 500 years. This mechanism of an ice ‘saddle collapse’ probably explains MWP-1A and the 8,200-year event and sheds light on the consequences of these events on climate."

https://openalex.org/W2017593987,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common human cancer. Although dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is known to be involved in a variety of cancers, the role of miRNAs in cSCC is unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify tumor suppressive and oncogenic miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of cSCC. MiRNA expression profiles in healthy skins (n = 4) and cSCCs (n = 4) were analyzed using MicroRNA Low Density Array. MiR-125b expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization in skin biopsies from 40 healthy donors, 13 actinic keratosis, and 74 cSCC patients. The effect of miR-125b was analyzed in wound closure, colony formation, migration, and invasion assays in two cSCC cell lines, UT-SCC-7 and A431. The genes regulated by miR-125b in cSCC were identified by microarray analysis and its direct target was validated by luciferase reporter assay. Comparing cSCC with healthy skin, we identified four up-regulated miRNAs (miR-31, miR-135b, miR-21, and miR-223) and 54 down-regulated miRNAs, including miR-125b, whose function was further examined. We found that miR-125b suppressed proliferation, colony formation, migratory, and invasive capacity of cSCC cells. Matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) was identified as a direct target suppressed by miR-125b, and there was an inverse relationship between the expression of miR-125b and MMP13 in cSCC. Knockdown of MMP13 expression phenocopied the effects of miR-125b overexpression. These findings provide a novel molecular mechanism by which MMP13 is up-regulated in cSCCs and indicate that miR-125b plays a tumor suppressive role in cSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2021549602,"Zobellia galactanivorans is an emerging model bacterium for the bioconversion of algal biomass. Notably, this marine Bacteroidetes possesses a complex agarolytic system comprising four β-agarases and five β-porphyranases, all belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 16. Although β-agarases are specific for the neutral agarobiose moieties, the recently discovered β-porphyranases degrade the sulfated polymers found in various quantities in natural agars. Here, we report the biochemical and structural comparison of five β-porphyranases and β-agarases from Z. galactanivorans. The respective degradation patterns of two β-porphyranases and three β-agarases are analyzed by their action on defined hybrid oligosaccharides. In light of the high resolution crystal structures, the biochemical results allowed a detailed mapping of substrate specificities along the active site groove of the enzymes. Although PorA displays a strict requirement for C6-sulfate in the -2- and +1-binding subsites, PorB tolerates the presence of 3-6-anhydro-l-galactose in subsite -2. Both enzymes do not accept methylation of the galactose unit in the -1 subsite. The β-agarase AgaD requires at least four consecutive agarose units (DP8) and is highly intolerant to modifications, whereas for AgaB oligosaccharides containing C6-sulfate groups at the -4, +1, and +3 positions are still degraded. Together with a transcriptional analysis of the expression of these enzymes, the structural and biochemical results allow proposition of a model scheme for the agarolytic system of Z. galactanivorans."
https://openalex.org/W2051629919,"The scaffolding protein Yotiao is a member of a large family of protein A-kinase anchoring proteins with important roles in the organization of spatial and temporal signaling. In heart, Yotiao directly associates with the slow outward potassium ion current (I(Ks)) and recruits both PKA and PP1 to regulate I(Ks) phosphorylation and gating. Human mutations that disrupt I(Ks)-Yotiao interaction result in reduced PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the I(Ks) subunit KCNQ1 and inhibition of sympathetic stimulation of I(Ks), which can give rise to long-QT syndrome. We have previously identified a subset of adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms that interact with Yotiao, including AC1-3 and AC9, but surprisingly, this group did not include the major cardiac isoforms AC5 and AC6. We now show that either AC2 or AC9 can associate with KCNQ1 in a complex mediated by Yotiao. In transgenic mouse heart expressing KCNQ1-KCNE1, AC activity was specifically associated with the I(Ks)-Yotiao complex and could be disrupted by addition of the AC9 N terminus. A survey of all AC isoforms by RT-PCR indicated expression of AC4-6 and AC9 in adult mouse cardiac myocytes. Of these, the only Yotiao-interacting isoform was AC9. Furthermore, the endogenous I(Ks)-Yotiao complex from guinea pig also contained AC9. Finally, AC9 association with the KCNQ1-Yotiao complex sensitized PKA phosphorylation of KCNQ1 to β-adrenergic stimulation. Thus, in heart, Yotiao brings together PKA, PP1, PDE4D3, AC9, and the I(Ks) channel to achieve localized temporal regulation of β-adrenergic stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W2170534823,"The aging suppressor geneKlotho is predominantly expressed in the kidney irrespective of species. Because Klotho protein is an essential component of an endocrine axis that regulates renal phosphate handling, the kidney-specific expression is biologically relevant; however, little is known about its underlying mechanisms. Here we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence indicating that promoter methylation restricts the expression of the Klotho gene in the kidney. Based on evolutionary conservation and histone methylation patterns, the region up to –1200 bp was defined as a major promoter element of the human Klotho gene. This region displayed promoter activity equally in Klotho-expressing and -nonexpressing cells in transient reporter assays, but the activity was reduced to ~20% when the constructs were integrated into the chromatin in the latter. Both endogenous and transfected Klotho promoters were 30–40% methylated in Klotho-nonexpressing cells, but unmethylated in Klotho-expressing renal tubular cells. DNA demethylating agents increased Klotho expression 1.5- to 3.0-fold in nonexpressing cells and restored the activity of silenced reporter constructs. Finally, we demonstrated that a severe hypomorphic allele of Klotho had aberrant CpG methylation in kl/kl mice. These findings might be useful in therapeutic intervention for accelerated aging and several complications caused by Klotho downregulation.—Azuma, M., Koyama, D., Kikuchi, J., Yoshizawa, H., Thasinas, D., Shiizaki, K., Kuro-o, M., Furukawa, Y., Kusano, E.

https://openalex.org/W2009062388,"One of the main functions of the unfolded protein response is to ensure disposal of large protein aggregates that accumulate in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) whereas avoiding, at least under nonlethal levels of ER stress, cell death. When tightly controlled, autophagy-dependent ER-associated degradation (ERAD(II)) allows the cell to recover from the transient accumulation of protein aggregates; however, when unchecked, it can be detrimental and cause autophagic cell death/type 2 cell death. Here we show that IRE1/XBP1 controls the induction of autophagy/ERAD(II) during the unfolded protein response by activating the ER membrane transporter SLC33A1/AT-1, which ensures continuous supply of acetyl-CoA into the lumen of the ER. Failure to induce AT-1 leads to widespread autophagic cell death. Mechanistically, the regulation of the autophagic process involves N(ε)-lysine acetylation of Atg9A."
https://openalex.org/W2042220227,"The multifunctional protein netrin-1 was initially discovered as the main attractive cue for commissural axon guidance by acting through its receptor DCC. Recently, we have shown that netrin-1 also interacts with the orphan transmembrane receptor amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is cleaved by proteases, generating amyloid-β peptide, the main component of the amyloid plaques that are associated with Alzheimer disease. Our previous work demonstrated that via its interaction with APP, netrin-1 is a negative regulator of amyloid-β production in adult brain, but the biological relevance of APP/netrin-1 interaction under non-pathological conditions was unknown. We show here that during commissural axon navigation, APP, expressed at the growth cone, is part of the DCC receptor complex mediating netrin-1-dependent axon guidance. APP interacts with DCC in the presence of netrin-1 and enhances netrin-1-mediated DCC intracellular signaling, such as MAPK activation. Inactivation of APP in mice is associated with reduced commissural axon outgrowth. Thus, APP functionally acts as a co-receptor for DCC to mediate axon guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2005635953,"Recruitment of effector T cells to sites of infection or inflammation is essential for an effective adaptive immune response. The chemokine CCL5 (RANTES) activates its cognate receptor, CCR5, to initiate cellular functions, including chemotaxis. In earlier studies, we reported that CCL5-induced CCR5 signaling activates the mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway to directly modulate mRNA translation. Specifically, CCL5-mediated mTOR activation contributes to T cell chemotaxis by initiating the synthesis of chemotaxis-related proteins. Up-regulation of chemotaxis-related proteins may prime T cells for efficient migration. It is now clear that mTOR is also a central regulator of nutrient sensing and glycolysis. Herein we describe a role for CCL5-mediated glucose uptake and ATP accumulation to meet the energy demands of chemotaxis in activated T cells. We provide evidence that CCL5 is able to induce glucose uptake in an mTOR-dependent manner. CCL5 treatment of ex vivo activated human CD3+ T cells also induced the activation of the nutrient-sensing kinase AMPK and downstream substrates ACC-1, PFKFB-2, and GSK-3β. Using 2-deoxy-d-glucose, an inhibitor of glucose uptake, and compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, experimental data are presented that demonstrate that CCL5-mediated T cell chemotaxis is dependent on glucose, as these inhibitors inhibit CCL5-mediated chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner. Altogether, these findings suggest that both glycolysis and AMPK signaling are required for efficient T cell migration in response to CCL5.

During nutrient deprivation or hypoxia, when intracellular levels of ATP decline and AMP levels rise, AMPK is activated.

Given that CCL5-CCR5 interactions induce mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling associated with energy-consuming processes such as mRNA translation and chemotaxis (15Hay N. Sonenberg N. Upstream and downstream of mTOR.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3455) Google Scholar), we undertook studies to examine whether CCL5/mTOR signaling may contribute to energy generation to support the high energy demands of activated T cells. We provide evidence that at concentrations that support chemotaxis, CCL5 enhances glucose uptake and ATP levels of activated T cells. Specifically, our data indicate that CCL5 simultaneously activates AMPK and mTOR signaling cascades to regulate glucose uptake and chemotaxis in activated T cells. This is the first report that provides evidence for a chemokine, CCL5, regulating metabolic intermediates, glucose and ATP, to facilitate efficient chemotaxis. Human peripheral blood (PB)-derived T lymphocytes were isolated from consenting healthy donors, as per a protocol approved by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). CD3+ T cells were purified using the StemSep T cell enrichment mixture according to the manufacturer's specifications (StemCell Technologies). T cells were subsequently activated in Microwell plates coated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody (eBiosciences), 5 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody (eBiosciences), and 5 ng/ml human recombinant IL-12 (Bioshop) for 2 days and further expanded in culture supplemented with 100 units/ml human recombinant IL-2 (Bioshop) every other day for 3 days. To avoid confounding data attributed to IL-2 effects, PB T cells that were used for CCL5 treatment experiments were stimulated with IL-2 on days 2 and 4, and then CCL5 was treated on day 6 without IL-2 stimulation. Cultures that served as positive controls were stimulated with IL-2 on days 2, 4, and 6. T cell purity and CCR5 expression were confirmed on day 6 by flow cytometric analysis using anti-human CD3 antibody, anti-human CD4, anti-human CD8 (eBiosciences) and anti-human CCR5 antibodies (2D7, BD Pharmingen; CD195, BD Bioscience) (supplemental Fig. 1). Antibodies for phospho-AMPK-α (Thr-172), AMPK-α, phospho-GSK-3β (Ser-9), phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr-37/46), and 4E-BP1, were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody was purchased from R&D Systems. Purified mouse anti-human CD98 (4F2HC) and GLUT-1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and R&D Systems, respectively. Inhibitors rapamycin and compound C were obtained from Calbiochem. The ATP bioluminescent assay kit, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and oligomycin were purchased from Sigma. CCL5 was a generous gift from Dr. Amanda Proudfoot (Geneva Research Centre, Merck Serono Intl.). The CCR5 antagonist, TAK-779, was kindly provided by Dr. Clifford Lingwood (University of Toronto, Sickkids Hospital). Cells were incubated with 10 nm CCL5 for the times indicated, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). For all experiments using inhibitors or activators, cells were pretreated for 1 h with the indicated compound prior to CCL5 treatment. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 50 μg of each protein lysate was denatured in Laemmli sample reducing buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by blocking with 5% BSA (w/v) in 1× TBST (0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were probed with the specified antibodies overnight in 5% BSA (w/v) in TBST at 4 °C and the respective proteins visualized using the ECL detection system (Pierce). 1 × 106 cells were incubated with mouse anti-human CCR5 antibody for 30 min on ice and washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS/2% FCS). Cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (eBiosciences). As a control, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody alone. T cell purity was determined by incubating cells with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD3 antibody. As an isotype control, cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-labeled isotype control IgG antibody (eBiosciences). For GLUT-1 and CD98 (4F2HC) surface expression, cells were washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were then washed twice with FACS buffer and incubated with mouse anti-human GLUT-1 antibody or mouse anti-human CD98 antibody for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Cells were analyzed using the FACSCalibur and FlowJo software (BD Biosciences). T cell chemotaxis was assayed using 24-well Transwell chambers with 5-μm pores (Corning). 1 × 105 cells in 100 μl of chemotaxis buffer (RPMI 1640/0.5% BSA) were placed in the upper chambers. CCL5, diluted in 600 μl of chemotaxis buffer, was placed in the lower wells, and the chambers were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells that migrated to the bottom wells were collected and counted with a hemocytometer. For experiments involving inhibitors, cells were pretreated for 1 h with the indicated inhibitor and then placed in the upper chambers. Cell viability, as measured by propidium iodide staining, was not affected by any of the doses of inhibitors used in this study (data not shown). 3–5 × 106 cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) (at pH 7.4, 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm HEPES). 2-Deoxy-d-[H3] glucose (2 μCi/reaction; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added in the presence of CCL5, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched by the addition of ice-cold KRH containing 200 μm phloretin (Calbiochem), followed by immediate centrifugation through an oil layer (1:1 phthalic acid and dibutlylpthalate from Sigma-Aldrich). Cell pellets were washed and solubilized in 1 m NaOH for 1 h, and radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. In experiments involving inhibitors, cells were pretreated for 1 h before the addition of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose and CCL5. Phosphorylation events in the AMPK signaling pathway were examined using the Full Moon BioSystems Antibody Microarray, according to the manufacturer's specifications (Full Moon BioSystems, Inc.) Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were stimulated with CCL5 for 10 min, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with 200 μl of extraction buffer. Protein samples were biotinylated, then added to a microscope slide chamber with specific antibodies bound to its surface. Cy3-streptavidin was added, and fluorescence was detected using the Axon GenePix 400A Microarray Scanner at PMT voltages between 300–400 (Molecular Devices). Intracellular ATP levels were examined using the ATP bioluminescent assay kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma-Aldrich). 2 × 105 cells were either left untreated or pretreated with compound C, 2-DG, or oligomycin prior to stimulation with CCL5. Cells were permeabilized using somatic cell ATP releasing agent and subsequently added to an ATP assay mix containing luciferin. Bioluminescence was measured using a VICTORTM X3 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Statistical significance was analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance. A level of p < 0.05 was chosen to identify significant differences. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. To investigate potential metabolic changes induced by CCL5 in activated T cells, we initially undertook a global screening approach for phosphorylation events examining the energy-sensing, AMPK signaling pathway. We employed an antibody microarray platform that measures the phosphorylation of upstream and downstream substrates of AMPK. At the outset, we confirmed that ex vivo cytokine activation of PB CD3+ T cells induced cell surface expression of CCR5 in a predominant CD4+ cell population (supplemental Fig. 1). Activated PB T cells were either left untreated or treated with 10 nm CCL5 for 10 min, the cells lysed, and the proteins were biotinylated, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Biotinylated proteins were then introduced into the microarray slide chambers conjugated with antibodies specific for the AMPK signaling cascade, and T cell-derived proteins were identified using a Cy3-streptavidin detection system. The microarray slide images generated are shown in Fig. 1A and phosphorylation quantitation in Fig. 1B. The data reveal that CCL5 treatment of T cells resulted in the rapid phosphorylation of a number of signaling effectors in the AMPK signaling pathway, as well as effectors in the PI3K/Akt and mTOR/4E-BP1 cascades. Notably, CCL5 induced the phosphorylation of PFKFB-2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2 or PFK-2), a positive regulator of glycolysis, ACC-1 (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1), an enzyme important for fatty acid synthesis and inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, and the master regulators of energy status: LKB1, AMPK1/AMPK2, and mTOR. To validate the antibody array findings for AMPK, Western immunoblot time course studies were performed. CCL5 induced maximal phosphorylation of AMPK-α on Thr-172 by 10 min (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation of Thr-172 is absolutely required for AMPK activation (24Gwinn D.M. Shackelford D.B. Egan D.F. Mihaylova M.M. Mery A. Vasquez D.S. Turk B.E. Shaw R.J.

Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar). CCL5 also induced the phosphorylation of GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β), a downstream substrate of AMPK, on Ser-9, with peak phosphorylation detected at 10 min post-CCL5 treatment (Fig. 2A). GSK-3β is a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase that regulates glycogen synthesis, gene transcription, mRNA translation, and cell proliferation. In its phosphorylated/inactive form, GSK-3β derepresses/releases downstream signaling mediated by glycogen synthase, eIF2B, NF-κB, and other downstream substrates (30Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R.

Thus, the inhibitory effect of CCL5 treatment on GSK-3β may regulate glycogen storage and other transcriptional events in activated T cells. During energetic stress, active AMPK is able to switch on catabolic processes that generate ATP (33Carling D.

To confirm the effects of CCL5 on AMPK activation and subsequent ATP generation, we evaluated intracellular ATP levels post-CCL5 treatment. Consistent with a maximal activation of AMPK at 10 min post-CCL5 treatment, CCL5 treatment induced maximal intracellular accumulation of ATP by 30 min (Fig. 2B). As a negative control, the AMPK inhibitor, compound C, was used to pretreat PB T cells prior to CCL5 stimulation. As predicted, compound C-treated cells exhibited significantly reduced intracellular ATP production at both 15 and 30 min following CCL5 treatment. These data suggest a role for CCL5 in positively regulating ATP levels in an AMPK-dependent manner. Additionally, to measure the relative CCL5-dependent contributions of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis on ATP production, activated PB T cells were pretreated with the inhibitors oligomycin or 2-DG prior to CCL5. A marked reduction in ATP generation induced by 2-DG and not oligomycin suggests that CCL5 inducible ATP generation is predominantly mediated by glycolysis (Fig. 2C). AMPK not only functions to initiate ATP regeneration but also induces glucose uptake during energy stress (36Hardie D.G. AMP-activated protein kinase: A master switch in glucose and lipid metabolism.Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2004; 5: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The nutrient-sensitive mTOR likewise responds to nutrient signals to regulate glycolysis (15Hay N. Sonenberg N.

As shown in Fig. 3A, CCL5 treatment of activated T cells resulted in a modest increase in glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal uptake at 10 nm of CCL5 (1.2–1.4-fold increase). As anticipated, IL-2 treatment of these activated T cells also resulted in a 1.5–1.9-fold increase in glucose uptake (22Wofford J.A. Wieman H.L. Jacobs S.R. Zhao Y. Rathmell J.C.

The specific contribution of mTOR signaling to the CCL5-mediated increase in glucose uptake was examined using rapamycin. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin effectively reduced CCL5-mediated glucose uptake (Fig. 3B). Finally, to confirm that CCL5 specifically induces glucose uptake through CCR5 activation, the CCR5 antagonist TAK-779 was employed. A marked reduction in glucose uptake was observed in T cells pretreated with TAK-"
https://openalex.org/W2148418495,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a catalytic cytokine and an upstream mediator of the inflammatory pathway. MIF has broad regulatory properties, dysregulation of which has been implicated in the pathology of multiple immunological diseases. Inhibition of MIF activity with small molecules has proven beneficial in a number of disease models. Known small molecule MIF inhibitors typically bind in the tautomerase site of the MIF trimer, often covalently modifying the catalytic proline. Allosteric MIF inhibitors, particularly those that associate with the protein by noncovalent interactions, could reveal novel ways to block MIF activity for therapeutic benefit and serve as chemical probes to elucidate the structural basis for the diverse regulatory properties of MIF. In this study, we report the identification and functional characterization of a novel allosteric MIF inhibitor. Identified from a high throughput screening effort, this sulfonated azo compound termed p425 strongly inhibited the ability of MIF to tautomerize 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate. Furthermore, p425 blocked the interaction of MIF with its receptor, CD74, and interfered with the pro-inflammatory activities of the cytokine. Structural studies revealed a unique mode of binding for p425, with a single molecule of the inhibitor occupying the interface of two MIF trimers. The inhibitor binds MIF mainly on the protein surface through hydrophobic interactions that are stabilized by hydrogen bonding with four highly specific residues from three different monomers. The mode of p425 binding reveals a unique way to block the activity of the cytokine for potential therapeutic benefit in MIF-associated diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1968983001,"Mammalian neuroglobin (Ngb) protects neuronal cells under conditions of oxidative stress. The mechanism underlying this function is only partly understood. Here, we report that human Ngb exists in lipid rafts only during oxidative stress and that lipid rafts are crucial for neuroprotection by Ngb. The ferrous oxygen-bound form of Ngb, which exists under normoxia, is converted to the ferric bis-His conformation during oxidative stress, inducing large tertiary structural changes. We clarified that ferric bis-His Ngb, but not ferrous ligand-bound Ngb, specifically binds to flotillin-1, a lipid raft microdomain-associated protein, as well as to α-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gα(i/o)). Moreover, we found that human ferric bis-His Ngb acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for Gα(i/o) that has been modified by oxidative stress. In addition, our data shows that Ngb inhibits the decrease in cAMP concentration that occurs under oxidative stress, leading to protection against cell death. Furthermore, by using a mutated Ngb protein that cannot form the bis-His conformation, we demonstrate that the oxidative stress-induced structural changes of human Ngb are essential for its neuroprotective activity."

Earlier reports have shown that in cellular expression systems diacylglycerol produced during type 1 angiotensin receptor signaling can be converted to 2-arachidonoylglycerol, an important endocannabinoid. Because activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) induces vasodilation and reduces blood pressure, we have tested the hypothesis that Ang II-induced 2-arachidonoylglycerol release can modulate its vasoconstrictor action in vascular tissue. Rat and mouse skeletal muscle arterioles and mouse saphenous arteries were isolated, pressurized, and subjected to microangiometry. Vascular expression of CB1R was demonstrated using Western blot and RT-PCR. In accordance with the functional relevance of these receptors WIN55212, a CB1R agonist, caused vasodilation, which was absent in CB1R knock-out mice. Inhibition of CB1Rs using O2050, a neutral antagonist, enhanced the vasoconstrictor effect of Ang II in wild type but not in CB1R knock-out mice. Inverse agonists of CB1R (SR141716 and AM251) and inhibition of diacylglycerol lipase using tetrahydrolipstatin also augmented the Ang II-induced vasoconstriction, suggesting that endocannabinoid release modulates this process via CB1R activation. This effect was independent of nitric-oxide synthase activity and endothelial function. These data demonstrate that Ang II stimulates vascular endocannabinoid formation, which attenuates its vasoconstrictor effect, suggesting that endocannabinoid release from the vascular wall and CB1R activation reduces the vasoconstrictor and hypertensive effects of Ang II.

Cannabinoid receptors were originally named after their affinity for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the main active ingredient of the extracts of Cannabis sativa. Endocannabinoid receptors include CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs), which are characteristically present in neural tissues, and CB2 receptors (CB2Rs), which occur mostly in immune cells (7Freund T.F. Katona I. Piomelli D. Role of endogenous cannabinoids in synaptic signaling.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1017-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). However, both receptors were identified in a number of other tissues, and the existence of other cannabinoid receptors has also been proposed (10Pacher P. Bátkai S. Kunos G.

CB1Rs in the central nervous system typically occur in presynaptic locations, and they modulate synaptic transmission. During stimulation by neurotransmitters such as glutamate and acetylcholine, endocannabinoid-mediated CB1R activation mediates important physiological functions such as depolarization-induced retrograde synaptic inhibition (7Freund T.F.

In addition to the key functions of endocannabinoids in the central nervous system, their roles in peripheral tissues are also increasingly in the focus of interest (12Kunos G. Osei-Hyiaman D.

Cardiovascular pharmacology of cannabinoids.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2005; 168: 599-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The growing number of studies with compounds that modulate the endocannabinoid system may lead to novel therapeutic approaches in a number of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders (10Pacher P.

Although CB1 receptors have key roles in the central neural control of appetite and evidence for the tonic activity of the endocannabinoid/CB1 receptor system in obesity provide a rationale for the use of CB1 receptor antagonists as anti-obesity agents, these molecules were withdrawn from the market due to their central side effects (12Kunos G.

We have reported recently in transient expression systems that Ang II-induced activation of AT1R can lead to CB1R activation in cells coexpressing both AT1 and CB1receptors (8Turu G. Várnai P.

Moreover, we have shown that stimulation of AT1Rs and other Gq/11 protein-coupled G protein-coupled receptors can cause 2-AG-mediated paracrine transactivation of CB1Rs (8Turu G. Várnai P. Gyombolai P. Szidonya L. Offertaler L. Bagdy G. Kunos G. Hunyady L. Paracrine transactivation of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor by AT1 angiotensin and other Gq/11 protein-coupled receptors.J. Biol.

The Ang II-induced CB1R activation was inhibited by DAG lipase inhibitors, suggesting that DAG generated from phosphoinositides can be converted to 2-AG by DAG lipase during the signaling of Ca2+-mobilizing hormones and neurotransmitters (8Turu G.

Although the physiological relevance of this mechanism has not been fully established, our preliminary data suggest that Ang II-induced endocannabinoid release may mediate the central hypertensive effect of Ang II in the paraventricular nucleus (16Gyombolai P. Pap D. Turu G. Catt K.J. Bagdy G. Hunyady L. Regulation of endocannabinoid release by G proteins. A paracrine mechanism of G protein-coupled receptor action.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2012; 353: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on our earlier findings on the mechanism of Ang II-induced paracrine transactivation of CB1 receptors, we hypothesized that the vasoconstrictor effect of Ang II may be attenuated by vascular endocannabinoid formation and consequent CB1R activation, and this mechanism can have a significant modulatory effect during the regulation of the vascular tone. This hypothesis was tested in this study. Male Wistar rats were used (300–350 g, Charles River Laboratories, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary). C57BL/6J (21–25 g) mice were obtained from the animal facility of the Department of Physiology. CB1R knock-out (−/−, CB1R-KO) and wild type (+/+, C57BL/6J, Cnr1tm1zim) mice (21–25 g) were kindly provided by Professor Andreas Zimmer, University of Bonn (9Zimmer A. Zimmer A.M. Hohmann A.G.

Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (Euthasol, ASTfarma, 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and immediately sacrificed by fast bleeding. All procedures conform with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH, 1996) legal and institutional guidelines for animal care and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Semmelweis University, Budapest and by Hungarian authorities (no. 263/003/2008). Angiotensin II, norepinephrine, sodium nitroprusside, acetylcholine (Ach), WIN55212 (R-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl) pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenyl-methanone mesylate (a CB1R agonist), tetrahydrolipstatin (a diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor) and Nω-nitro-l-arginine (LNA) (a nitric oxide (NO)-synthase inhibitor) were purchased from Sigma. CB1R antagonists O2050 (6aR,10aR)-3-(1-methanesulfonylamino-4-hexyn-6-yl)-6a,7,10,10a-tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-6H dibenzo [b,d]pyran), a silent antagonist, and inverse agonist AM251 (N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-car boxamide) were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Elliswille, MI), and SR141716 (rimonabant, 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-N-1-piperidinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide) was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Tallinn, Estonia). AT1R antagonist candesartan was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Rat and mouse skeletal muscle (gracilis) arterioles (∼120 μm in diameter) and mouse saphenous arteries (∼180 μm in diameter, Table 1) were prepared under microscopic guidance. For the preparation of gracilis arterioles the adductor muscles were removed, placed into cold Krebs solution that contained 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, and prepared as described before (17Sun D.

For the preparation of saphenous arteries, the surface of the leg was cleared from the skin, and the arterial segment was further isolated in situ using a microscope (19Várbíró S. Nádasy G.L.

Pharmacological agonists were administered in a concentration-dependent manner into the chamber, and steady-state diameter was recorded for each concentration or in a single (submaximal) concentration. 10-Min washout periods were applied between drugs. Precontraction of segments before vasodilator treatment was made with norepinephrine (50–100 nm). Endothelial integrity was tested by Ach (10 μm, NO-dependent vasodilator) in all experiments. The experiments were terminated by obtaining passive (relaxed) vascular diameter in calcium-free Krebs solution. According to specific protocols on rat gracilis arterioles, concentration-responses to Ang II were obtained in vehicle or with CB1R inhibitors O2050 (neutral antagonist, 1 μm), SR141716, and AM251 (inverse agonists 1–1 μm) in three different experimental sets for each inhibitor (nine, five, and five animals, respectively). Ang II-induced concentration-responses were repeated on separate segments to prevent desensitization (data not shown), which can be attributed to the rapid agonist-induced AT1R-internalization (3Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Pleiotropic AT1 receptor signaling pathways mediating physiological and pathogenic actions of angiotensin II.Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 953-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Because AM251, an inhibitor of CB1Rs was reported to inhibit also constitutive activity of CB1Rs previously (8Turu G. Várnai P. Gyombolai P. Szidonya L. Offertaler L. Bagdy G. Kunos G. Hunyady L.

Chem. 2009; 284: 16914-16921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we also applied the neutral antagonist of CB1R, O2050. Inhibitor was applied for at least 10 min before and during agonist administration. In these experiments CB1R agonist WIN55212 (1 μm) was also applied. Endothelial integrity was tested by Ach, and vasodilator capacity of rat gracilis vessels was also tested by sodium nitroprusside (up to 10 μm). In similar protocols, responses to Ang II were also obtained with DAG lipase inhibition by THL (1 μm, n = 6). DAG lipase inhibition was applied to clarify the role of endogenously produced endocannabinoids in the vascular CB1R activity. In separate experiments, simultaneous administration of THL and O2050 was also applied (additional three rats), and effects of Ang II were also obtained. In additional experiments, the effects of WIN55212 and Ang II were also obtained with LNA (10 μm, n = 5) and with endothelial disruption (performed with intraluminal administration of a bubble for 10 minutes, n = 6) to test the NO/endothelial dependence of the cannabinoid effects. In additional experiments (n = 4), AT1R blocker candesartan (10 μm) was also applied to repeat Ang II concentration-responses to test the AT1R dependence of the Ang II response on rat gracilis arterioles (0.1–100 nm). The CB1R inhibitor O2050 was also tested on mouse gracilis arterioles (n = 4). To clarify the role of CB1Rs in the control of vascular tone, a similar protocol was also performed on saphenous arteries from CB1R knock-out (n = 4) and wild type (n = 4) mice with inhibition of CB1Rs (O2050). In an additional set of experiments (n = 6) the effect of THL on the vasoactive responses was also tested on mouse saphenous arteries of control mice of the CB1R KO tribe (C57BL/6J). Control and passive diameter and spontaneous tone of the prepared segments are summarized (Table 1). The number of animals used in each set is given (n), and 1–2 segments were prepared from each animal. In all experimental settings vehicles were also tested, and time control was also applied. Segments of thoracic aorta were removed and gracilis arterioles were removed under microscopic guidance as described above from 4 rats. Samples were washed and placed in cold sterile phosphate buffer solution (PBS, with 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). RNA was extracted and further processed for real-time PCR (Roche Applied Science) as described (23Szekeres M. Nádasy G.L. Turu G. Süpeki K. Szidonya L. Buday L. Chaplin T. Clark A.J. Hunyady L. Angiotensin II-induced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in human and rat adrenocortical cells.Endocrinology. 2010; 151: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RT-PCR assays were performed using the SYBR Green method. Primers were designed and synthesized by Sigma. Cycling conditions were: 10 min of preincubation at 95 °C, 45–50 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 62 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. Fluorescence data including melting curves were obtained. For normalization, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), a housekeeping gene, was used (ENSRNOG00000004253). Relative messenger RNA levels of cannabinoid receptor type 1 gene (Cnr1) were calculated (ENSRNOG00000008223). Primers for Cnr1 were forward (GGACTCAGACTGCCTGCACA) and reverse (ACAAAAGCAGCAGGCTCACA) and for Gapdh were forward (CCTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG) and reverse (CAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCAGTGATG). Tissue gene expression levels were plotted against Gapdh expression levels. Amplicons obtained from gel electrophoresis and relative CB1R mRNA values are shown in Fig. 1B. Tissue perfusion was performed under anesthesia. Rat and mouse gracilis muscles were removed, washed in ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde subjected to cryoprotection in sucr"
https://openalex.org/W2018798951,"Skeletal muscles are proficient at healing from a variety of injuries. Healing occurs in two phases, early and late phase. Early phase involves healing the injured sarcolemma and restricting the spread of damage to the injured myofiber. Late phase of healing occurs a few days postinjury and involves interaction of injured myofibers with regenerative and inflammatory cells. Of the two phases, cellular and molecular processes involved in the early phase of healing are poorly understood. We have implemented an improved sarcolemmal proteomics approach together with in vivo labeling of proteins with modified amino acids in mice to study acute changes in the sarcolemmal proteome in early phase of myofiber injury. We find that a notable early phase response to muscle injury is an increased association of mitochondria with the injured sarcolemma. Real-time imaging of live myofibers during injury demonstrated that the increased association of mitochondria with the injured sarcolemma involves translocation of mitochondria to the site of injury, a response that is lacking in cultured myoblasts. Inhibiting mitochondrial function at the time of injury inhibited healing of the injured myofibers. This identifies a novel role of mitochondria in the early phase of healing injured myofibers."

Furthermore, it indicates that the tethering of FtsZ to the membrane shows sufficient plasticity to allow for its release from noncentral regions of the cytoplasmic membrane and its subsequent relocation to midcell when demanded by the assembly of a division ring."

One approach for targeting this tumor-specific receptor utilizes the cognate ligand, IL-13, conjugated to cytotoxic molecules. However, this approach lacks specificity because the lower affinity receptor for IL-13, IL13Rα1, is widely expressed by normal tissues. Here, we aimed to develop and characterize a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to IL13Rα2 for the therapeutic purpose of targeting IL13Rα2-expressing tumors. Hybridoma cell lines were generated and compared for binding affinities to recombinant human IL13Rα2 (rhIL13Rα2). Clone 47 demonstrated binding to the native conformation of IL13Rα2 and was therefore chosen for further studies. Clone 47 bound specifically and with high affinity (KD = 1.39 × 10−9 m) to rhIL13Rα2 but not to rhIL13Rα1 or murine IL13Rα2. Furthermore, clone 47 specifically recognized wild-type IL13Rα2 expressed on the surface of CHO and HEK cells as well as several glioma cell lines. Competitive binding assays revealed that clone 47 also significantly inhibited the interaction between human soluble IL-13 and IL13Rα2 receptor. Moreover, we found that N-linked glycosylation of IL13Rα2 contributes in part to the interaction of the antibody to IL13Rα2. In vivo, the IL13Rα2 mAb improved the survival of nude mice intracranially implanted with a human U251 glioma xenograft.

Until recently, IL13Rα2 was thought to act as a decoy receptor for IL-13 (10Rahaman S.O. Sharma P. Harbor P.C. Aman M.J. Vogelbaum M.A. Haque S.J.

However, recent studies have challenged that theory based on studies demonstrating that upon binding of IL-13 to IL13Rα2 downstream signaling occurs in specialized pulmonary macrophages (11Fichtner-Feigl S. Strober W. Kawakami K. Puri R.K. Kitani A. IL-13 signaling through the IL-13α2 receptor is involved in induction of TGF-β1 production and fibrosis.Nat.

GBM is a highly infiltrative tumor often making complete surgical removal impossible. Moreover, GBM is highly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy (16Stupp R. Mason W.P. van den Bent M.J.

Several studies have investigated the therapeutic properties of an IL-13 fusion protein conjugated to a recombinant cytotoxin derived from Pseudomonas exotoxin A (IL-13PE) that induces apoptosis in IL13Rα2-expressing glioma cells in vitro, in preclinical animal models, and in patients tested in clinical trials (17Kunwar S.

However, such agents lack a high specificity of interaction with IL13Rα2 due to the alternative binding of ubiquitously expressed IL13Rα1. Therefore, developing highly selective antibody fragments that can be combined with toxins for specificity to IL13Rα2-expressing cells is considered to be a promising pursuit. Previous work has investigated a phage display library approach for selecting small antibody fragments specific to human IL13Rα2 followed by their evaluation in vitro and in vivo (23Kioi M. Seetharam S. Puri R.K. Targeting IL-13Rα2-positive cancer with a novel recombinant immunotoxin composed of a single-chain antibody and mutated Pseudomonas exotoxin.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Despite the high specificity of interaction with IL13Rα2, conjugation with toxins has failed to increase cytotoxicity in IL13Rα2-expressing glioma and renal cell carcinoma cell lines when compared with the effects of IL-13PE38. The low affinity of generated antibody fragments is the most reasonable explanation for the lack of success. Antibody fragments derived from phage display libraries are known to be lower in affinity and avidity than antibodies generated by conventional hybridoma technology (24Pini A. Bracci L. Phage display of antibody fragments.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2000; 1: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Modifications of those small antibody fragments are often required to enhance their affinity and avidity to targeted proteins. In recent years, monoclonal antibodies have shown increasing success as targeted anticancer and diagnostic agents (25Ross J.S. Gray K. Gray G.S. Worland P.J. Rolfe M. Anticancer antibodies.Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2003; 119: 472-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Souriau C. Hudson P.J. Recombinant antibodies for cancer diagnosis and therapy.Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2003; 3: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and a further search for high affinity reagents with restricted specificity to tumor-associated antigens is in progress. Historically, the hybridoma cell line specific to the antigen IL13Rα2, however, has been unavailable to the scientific community. Thus, the goal of the present study was to discover, develop, and characterize a high affinity antibody that specifically recognizes IL13Rα2 expressed on the surface of cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate the generation of an antibody possessing the properties critical for immunotherapeutic targeting of IL13Rα2-expressing tumors in vivo and potentially suitable for various other applications. Lipofectamine 2000 and the pEF6/Myc-His vector were obtained from Invitrogen. mAbs to IL13Rα2 (clones YY-23Z and B-D13) and the IsoStrip mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The mAb to IL13Rα2 (clone 83807) and recombinant human and mouse IL13Rα2hFc and IL13Rα1hFc chimeras were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibodies and the Elite kit were obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine substrate was purchased from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with peroxidase was purchased from Chemicon International (Temicula, CA), and Pngase F was purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). The QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA), and the RNeasy Plus kit was received from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The cDNA iScript kit, 7.5% Tris-HCl gel, and ImmunStar WesternC developing reagent and protein marker were purchased from Bio-Rad. The human IL-13 ELISA kit was purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). GBM12 and GBM43 were kindly provided by Dr. David C. James (University of California-San Francisco), and the cDNA encoding human wild-type IL13Rα2 was obtained from Dr. Waldemar Debinski (Wake Forest University). To obtain monoclonal antibodies with specificity to native IL13Rα2, the human recombinant IL13Rα2hFc fusion was used for immunization of animals and in all screening assays. Two 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized with intraperitoneal injection of 10 μg of rhIL13Rα2hFc protein in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by intraperitoneal injection of 10 μg of rhIL13Rα2hFc protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at a 2-week interval for 2 months. Two weeks after the last intraperitoneal injection and 3 days before the fusion, a boost was performed by the combination of intravenous and intraperitoneal injection of 10 μg of antigen without Freund's adjuvant. The fusion of mouse spleen cells with the mouse myeloma cell line X63.Ag8.653 subclone P3O1 was performed by using a procedure described by Köhler and Milstein (27Köhler G. Milstein C. Continuous cultures of fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity.Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12712) Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants were assayed for the presence of IL13Rα2 antibodies using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Selected populations were cloned, and supernatants were assayed to identify the clones with strongest binding. The cDNA encoding human wild-type IL13Rα2 was amplified with the following primer pair: forward, 5′-GCTTGGTACCGAATGGCTTTCGTTTGCTTGGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GTTTTTGTTCGAATGTATCACAGAAAAATTCTGG-3′. The purified PCR product was restricted with KpnI and BstBI enzymes, agarose gel-purified, and subsequently cloned into the pEF6/Myc-His vector in a reading frame with Myc and His6 tags. CHO cells were plated at 80% confluence and transfected with a plasmid encoding the IL13Rα2 using Lipofectamine 2000. The following day, 4 μg/ml blasticidin was added for selection of cells that had stably incorporated and expressed the IL13Rα2 transcript. A stable population of cells was further subcloned in 96-well plates at a density of one cell/well. Ten days later, single clones were screened by flow cytometry for cell surface expression of IL13Rα2 using an antibody to IL13Rα2 (clone B-D13). The clone with the highest level of IL13Rα2 expression was selected and expanded for subsequent screening of hybridomas secreting IL13Rα2 antibodies. 96-well plates were coated with 50 μl of human or mouse recombinant IL13Rα2hFc or IL13Rα1hFc or human control IgG at a concentration of 1 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. Following washes with TBS-Tween 20 buffer and blocking with 1% nonfat dry milk, 50 μl of purified antibodies, serum, or hybridoma supernatants at various dilutions were applied to the plate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase following the development with alkaline phosphatase substrate. Plates were read at A405 using a UniRead 800 plate reader (BioTek). CHO or HEK cells expressing IL13Rα2; the glioma cell lines A172, N10, U251, U87, and U118; patient-derived GBM12 and GBM43, and primary human astrocytes were stained with IL13Rα2 (clone 47) mAb at 1 μg/ml followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (1:500). All staining procedures were performed on ice. Samples were analyzed using the BD FACSCanto flow cytometer and FACSDiVaTM software. To determine the expression of IL13Rα2 in various glioma cells and astrocytes, total RNA was generated from the cell pellets using the RNeasy Plus kit. 200 ng of total RNA was then converted into cDNA using the cDNA iScript kit. The cDNA was further amplified for IL13Rα2 and GAPDH for 30 cycles using IL13Rα2 and GAPDH primers and visualized on a 1% agarose gel. The affinity and rates of interaction between IL13Rα2 (clone 47) mAb, commercially available IL13Rα2 mAbs (clones 83807 and B-D13), and target (rhIL13Rα2) were measured with a Biacore 3000 biosensor through surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The mAbs were immobilized (covalently) to the dextran matrix of the sensor chip (CM5) using the amino coupling kit. The carboxyl groups on the sensor surfaces were activated with an injection of a solution containing 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. The immobilization procedure was completed by the injection of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride to block the remaining ester groups. All steps of the immobilization process were carried out at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The control surface was prepared similarly with the exception that running buffer was injected rather than mAbs. Binding reactions were performed at 25 °C in HBS-P buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20) using a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Target (rhIL13Rα2) was added at various concentrations in the flow during the binding phase. The amount of protein bound to the sensor chip was monitored by the change in refractive index (represented by response units (RU)). The instrument was programmed to perform a series of binding measurements with increasing concentrations of target over the same surface. Triplicate injections of each concentration of target were performed. Sensorgrams (plots of changes in RU on the surface as a function of time) were analyzed using BIAevaluation v4.1. Affinity constants were estimated by curve fitting using a 1:1 binding model. The estimation of kinetic parameters was performed by repetitive injections of a range of target concentrations over the immobilized mAbs. Data were prepared by the method of “double referencing.” This method utilizes parallel injections of each target sample over a control dextran surface as well as running buffer injections over both the immobilized mAbs and control dextran surfaces. Subtraction of these sensorgrams yielded the control; this was subtracted from the experimental sensorgram. Each data set (consisting of sensorgrams of increasing target concentrations over the same level of immobilized mAbs) was analyzed using various kinetic models. The BIAevaluation v 4.1 software was then used for data analysis. Affinity constants were estimated by curve fitting using a 1:1 binding model. Sensorgram association and dissociation curves were fit locally or globally. The rate of complex formation during the sample injection is described by an equation of the following type: dR/dt = kaC (Rmax − R) − kdR (for a 1:1 interaction) where R is the SPR signal in RU, C is the concentration of analyte, Rmax is the maximum analyte binding capacity in RU, and dR/dt is the rate of change of SPR signal. The early binding phase (300 s) was used to determine the association constant (ka) between mAb and target. The dissociation phase (kd) was measured using the rate of decline in RU on introduction of free buffer at the end of target injections. Data were simultaneously fit by the software program (global fitting algorithm), and the dissociation constant (KD) of the complexes was determined as the ratio ka/kd. For quantitative analysis, three independent replicates were performed for each sample. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. For the competitive binding plate assay, a 96-well plate was coated with 50 μl of affinity-purified hrIL13Rα2hFc at 1 μg/ml in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 and stored overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, mAbs to IL13Rα2 (10 μg/ml) or control mIgG were added for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, 50 μl of purified rhIL-13 in PBS and 0.1% BSA at 10 ng/ml was added for a 1-h incubation at room temperature and assayed for bound rhIL-13 using detection reagents from a human IL-13 ELISA kit. Separately, HEK cells expressing wild-type or 4-amino acid mutants in the IL13Rα2 sequence were pretreated with either rhIL-13 or mAb IL13Rα2 (clone 47) at 2 μg/ml for 30 min on ice followed by a 1-h incubation with IL13Rα2 (clone 47) mAb or rhIL-13 at 100 ng/ml, respectively. Binding of rhIL-13 to IL13Rα2 alone or in presence of the competitor was detected with human IL-13 mAb-FITC. Binding of IL13Rα2 (clone 47) mAb to rhIL13Rα2 alone or in presence of the competitor was detected with anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 649 and analyzed by flow cytometry. Previously, Tyr207, Asp271, Tyr315, and Asp318 of the human IL13Rα2 were identified as residues crucial for the interaction with human IL-13 (28Arima K. Sato K. Tanaka G. Kanaji S. Terada T. Honjo E. Kuroki R. Matsuo Y. Izuhara K. Characterization of the interaction between interleukin-13 and interleukin-13 receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24915-24922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine whether those residues were important for binding of the IL13Rα2 (clone 47) mAb to IL13Rα2, the Tyr207, Asp271, Tyr315, and Asp318 were mutated to Ala separately or at the same time (4-amino acid mutant) using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Sequencing of selected clones was performed in house and confirmed the presence of the selected mutation. HEK cells were transfected with wild-type or mutated variants of IL13Rα2 cDNA in the pEF6 Myc-His vector using Lipofectamine Plus transfection reagent. 48 h after transfection, the cells were collected and analyzed for binding to IL13Rα2 (clone 47) mAb via flow cytometry. The rhIL13Rα2 was applied to a 7.5% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) at 200 ng/lane and resolved under reducing conditions. After the transfer of proteins to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocking with 2% nonfat dry milk, the membrane was stained with anti-IL13Rα2 mAb (clones YY-23Z and B-D13) at 2 μg/ml or with supernatant collected from hybridoma clones (diluted 10 times), followed by goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to peroxidase. ImmunStar WesternC was used to develop the reaction. Images were captured using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system. The GBM tissues were collected in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Chicago. Flash frozen brain tumor tissues were cut to a thickness of 10 μm. Tissue sections were fixed with −20 °C methanol and stained for human IL13Rα2 using mouse IL13Rα2 (clone 47) mAb at a concentration of 3 μg/ml or isotype control mIgG1. The bound antibodies were detected with biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibodies (1:100). The antigen-antibody binding was detected by the Elite kit with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate. Slides were analyzed using the CRI Panoramic Scan Whole Slide Scanner and Panoramic Viewer software. All animals were maintained and cared for in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol and according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. The animals used in the experiments were 6–7 week-old male athymic nu/nu mice. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine hydrochloride/xylazine (25 mg/ml/2.5 mg/ml) mixture. To establish intracranial tumors, a midline cranial incision was made, and a right-sided burr hole was placed 2 mm lateral to the sagittal suture and ∼2 mm superior to λ. Animals were positioned in a stereotactic frame, and a Hamilton needle was inserted through the burr hole and advanced 3 mm. Intracranial penetration was followed by (i) injection of 2.5 × 104 U251 glioma cells in 2.5 μl of sterile PBS in combination with 200 ng of mIgG or IL13Rα2 (clone 47) mAb or (ii) 3 days postintracranial injection of glioma cells with PBS or 10 μg of IL13Rα2 (clone 47 or B-D13) mAb as described previously (29Sampson J.H. Crotty L.E. Lee S. Archer G.E. Ashley D.M. Wikstrand C.J. Hale L.P. Small C. Dranoff G. Friedman A.H. Friedman H.S. Bigner D.D. Unarmed, tumor-specific monoclonal antibody effectively treats brain tumors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7503-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). All mice were monitored for survival. Three animals from each group were sacrificed at day 17, and brains were harvested and frozen for sectioning, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and microscopic analysis. The differences between groups were evaluated by Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance with post hoc comparison Tukey's test or Dunnett's test. For the in vivo survival data, a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used, and statistical analysis was performed using a log rank test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The primary goal of this study was to generate a high affinity monoclonal antibody suitable for targeting of the IL13Rα2 expressed on the surface of tumor cells. We therefore immunized mice and screened the resulting hybridoma clones for reactivity against the antigen, rhIL13Rα2, in its native conformation. A plate-bound ELISA utilizing a hybridoma clone against rhIL13Rα2, YY-23Z, was established for the detection of rhIL13Rα2. The concentration of rhIL13Rα2 absorbed to the plastic at 1 μg/ml was found to be suitable for the detection of antibody binding (Fig. 1A). Next, the rhIL13Rα2hFc was characterized for its “nativity” by utilizing a pair of commercially available antibodies recognizing only the native (found on the cell surface) and denatured (using Western blotting under reducing conditions) forms of IL13Rα2 and for its binding properties to rhIL13Rα2 in ELISA with antibody clones B-D13 and YY-23Z, respectively. Both clones B-D13 and YY-23Z were able to recognize the rhIL13Rα2hFc in a plate-bound ELISA (Fig. 1B). Denaturation of antigen at 95 °C for 5 min in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol completely abolished the ability of the antibody clone B-D13 to recognize antigen by ELISA, whereas the YY-23Z clone retained the ability to bind the denatured antigen. Thus, the rhIL13Rα2hFc absorbed to the plastic of ELISA plates containing both native and denatured forms of the protein. Analysis of serum from animals immunized with a fusion of rhIL13Rα2 and hFc revealed the presence of antibodies against both rhIL13Rα2 and human Fc fragment (data not shown). To select antibodies specific for the IL13Rα2 portion of the fusion, human IgG was included as an additional negative control for the screening of hybridoma populations. Of the 39 screened primary populations, only 15 populations were specific to IL13Rα2, and four were reactive with human IgG. Finally, five clones strongly reacting with native IL13Rα2 were further expanded and recloned. The two clones recognizing only denatured antigen were selected from the separate immunization set with rhIL13Rα2hFc chimera (data not shown). Supernatants from selected clones were compared for their ability to bind hrIL13Rα2 in a plate-bound ELISA (Fig. 1C) and by Western blotting (Fig. 1D). Fig. 1C shows that clone 47 strongly binds to the antigen in plate-bound ELISA but not by Western blotting, indicating the ability of clone 47 to recognize a native conformation of the antigen. Therefore, clone 47 was selected for all subsequent studies and analysis for its properties. Clone 47 was found to be of the IgG1 isotype possessing a κ chain (data not shown). We investiga"

IscU populates two conformational states in solution, a structured conformation (S) that resembles the conformation of the holoprotein IscU-[2Fe-2S] and a dynamically disordered conformation (D) that does not bind metal ions. NMR spectroscopic results presented here show that the specialized Hsp70 chaperone (HscA), alone or as the HscA-ADP complex, preferentially binds to and stabilizes the D-state of IscU. IscU is released when HscA binds ATP. By contrast, the J-protein HscB binds preferentially to the S-state of IscU. Consistent with these findings, we propose a mechanism in which cluster transfer is coupled to hydrolysis of ATP bound to HscA, conversion of IscU to the D-state, and release of HscB.

It is detected at late stages when the disease is spread through the abdominal cavity in a condition known as peritoneal carcinomatosis. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic interventions to target advanced stages of ovarian cancer. Mammary serine protease inhibitor (Maspin) represents an important metastasis suppressor initially identified in breast cancer. Herein we have generated a sequence-specific zinc finger artificial transcription factor (ATF) to up-regulate the Maspin promoter in aggressive ovarian cancer cell lines and to interrogate the therapeutic potential of Maspin in ovarian cancer. We found that although Maspin was expressed in some primary ovarian tumors, the promoter was epigenetically silenced in cell lines derived from ascites. Transduction of the ATF in MOVCAR 5009 cells derived from ascitic cultures of a TgMISIIR-TAg mouse model of ovarian cancer resulted in tumor cell growth inhibition, impaired cell invasion, and severe disruption of actin cytoskeleton. Systemic delivery of lipid-protamine-RNA nanoparticles encapsulating a chemically modified ATF mRNA resulted in inhibition of ovarian cancer cell growth in nude mice accompanied with Maspin re-expression in the treated tumors. Gene expression microarrays of ATF-transduced cells revealed an exceptional specificity for the Maspin promoter. These analyses identified novel targets co-regulated with Maspin in human short-term cultures derived from ascites, such as TSPAN12, that could mediate the anti-metastatic phenotype of the ATF.

The ability of secreted proteases to cleave and activate ENaC has not been thoroughly investigated. Various epithelial cells are known to secrete proteases. Cathepsin B is a lysosomal cysteine protease that is expressed in epithelial cells and tissues (35Mort J.S. Buttle D.J. Cathepsin B.Int. J. Biochem.

Like other integral membrane proteins, ENaC is susceptible to proteolysis by secreted proteases in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Here we demonstrate that the commonly used Xenopus 2F3 subclone of the A6 cell line in the study of the regulation of ENaC secretes the protease cathepsin B exclusively on the apical side. Our findings also show that this protease can cleave ENaC in vitro and activate ENaC in situ. 2F3 cells were a kind gift of Dr. Dale Benos. The cells were seeded onto permeable polyester inserts and cultured in 50/50 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 base media (Invitrogen) at pH 7.4 and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1.5 μm aldosterone, 0.6% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator with 4% CO2 in air. Experiments were performed using cells between passages 98 and 106. Apical and basolateral media was subject to a cleanup procedure using the ReadyPrep 2-D cleanup kit (Bio-Rad) to concentrate the sample and to remove contaminants that could interfere with isoelectric focusing. Two-hundred micrograms of the purified protein sample prepared in 125 μl of rehydration/sample buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2% (w/v) Bio-lyte 3/10 ampholytes, and bromphenol blue) was applied to IPG strips (pH 4–7 ReadyStrip, 7-cm, Bio-Rad). The strips were allowed to rehydrate for 16 h at room temperature. The rehydrated IPG strips were transferred to an isoelectric focusing tray, and electrode wicks were used as receptacles for non-amphoteric constituents. The IPG strips were covered with mineral oil and then focused using a Protean IEF cell (Bio-Rad) according to the following parameters (250 V, linear ramp, 20 min; 4,000 V, linear ramp, 2 h; 4,000 V rapid ramp, 10,000 V-h; 20 °C, 50 μA/strip). Focused IPG strips were transferred to an equilibration tray and incubated with 2.5 ml of equilibration buffer 1 (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, and 2% (w/v) DTT) for 10 min on an orbital shaker at room temperature. The IPG strips were then incubated with 2.5 ml of equilibration buffer 2 (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, and with 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide) for 10 min on an orbital shaker at room temperature. To visualize the separated proteins, 4–15% gradient IPG gels were fixed with Colloidal Coomassie fixing solution (45% methanol, 1% acetic acid, 54% ultrapure H2O) for 1 h and then stained with Colloidal Coomassie staining solution (170 g/liter ammonium sulfate, 1 g/liter Coomassie G250, 0.5% acetic acid, 34% methanol) for 8 h and then destained in destaining solution (5% methanol, 95% ultrapure H2O) for 8 h. Selected protein spots were excised from Coomassie-stained gels and then transferred to keratin-free tubes. The gel spots were subject to in-gel tryptic digestion followed by liquid extraction of the gel fragments. The peptides were extracted and concentrated under vacuum centrifugation. A nanoflow liquid chromatograph (Easy-nLC, Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) coupled to an electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, Thermo, San Jose, CA) was used for tandem mass spectrometry peptide sequencing experiments. Spectra were analyzed by searching with the publicly available search algorithm Mascot using the National Center for Biotechnology Information and SwissProt databases. 2F3 cells were washed with 1× PBS and lysed with mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific; Rockford, IL) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific) followed by passing the lysate 5 times through a 23-gauge needle with a syringe before being incubated on ice for 1 h. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. One hundred micrograms of protein was loaded and resolved on 7.5% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide precast gels using either the Criterion or Protean Western blotting system (Bio-Rad). The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) and then blocked in 5% (w/v) dry milk in 1× TBS (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblotting was performed by first incubating the blocked membranes with peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST antibody (Sigma) or anti-cathepsin B antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) at a 1:1000 dilution prepared in 5% BSA, 1× TBS for 8 h at 4 °C. After a series of three 5-min washes with 1× TBS, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:3000 prepared in blocking solution. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using a SuperSignal Dura chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were exposed using the Kodak Gel Logic 2200 Imager and Molecular Imaging software system (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY), and relative molecular masses of the immunoreactive bands were assessed using Precision Plus Protein Standards (Bio-Rad). Densitometry was conducted using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Protein levels are presented as arbitrary units of a ratio between the band intensity for the protein of interest and the band intensity of actin. The entire coding sequence of each ENaC subunit was subcloned into the pGEX4T-2 expression vector. The constructs were transformed into competent Escherichia coli cells, and expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The fusion proteins were purified and recovered from bacterial inclusion bodies as previously described by Alli and Gower (42Alli A.A. Gower Jr., W.R.

The voltage and resistance across confluent monolayers were measured with an epithelial Voltohmeter (EVOM; World Precision Instrument, Sarasota, FL), and transepithelial amiloride-sensitive current was calculated per unit area according to Ohm's law before and after application of 10 μm cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-74) (Calbiochem) or vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma) at time points between 5 and 60 min. The cells were harvested for protein for biochemical studies as described above. Micropipettes were pulled (two-stage vertical puller; Tokyo, Japan) from filamented borosilicate glass capillaries (TW-150F, World Precision Instruments). The basolateral and apical membranes of 2F3 cells subcultured on Lucite rings were exposed to pipette solution (96 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES). The micropipettes were filled with the same patch solution and had a resistance between 5 and 10 ohms. The product of the number of channels (N) and the single-channel open probability (Po) was used to calculate ENaC activity within a patch. The number of current levels or the number of peaks detected in current amplitude histograms were used to estimate the total number of channels in a patch. The open probability of a single channel in a patch was calculated by dividing NPo by the number of channels in a patch. Single channel currents from gigaohm seals were filtered at 100 Hz and recorded at 500 Hz using the Clampfit 10.1 software (Molecular Devices). Active cathepsin B protease purified from human liver was purchased from Calbiochem. Five micrograms of freshly prepared recombinant ENaC GST fusion proteins in elution buffer was incubated with 5 μg of cathepsin B protease at 37 °C for 8 h. The reactions were terminated by adding sample buffer containing SDS. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. siRNA targeting cathepsin B (sense, 5′-AGUCUAUGGCAGUGACAAAUU-3′; antisense, 5′-UUUGUCACUGCCAUAGACUUU-3′) was designed using the siDESIGN tool and purchased from Thermo Scientific. As a control, non-targeting siRNA was used (siGENOME non-targeting siRNA #2; Thermo Scientific). Cells were transfected with siRNA using Xfect transfection reagent (Clontech; Mountain View, CA) while following the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent cells grown on transwell-permeable support were treated with drug or vehicle for 3 h in an incubator. The apical side of the inserts was washed twice with sterile ice-cold PBS and then incubated for 30 min in ice-cold borate buffer (85 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 15 mMNa2B4O7, pH 9.0) containing biotin (ThermoScientific) (0.5 mg/ml). The cells were then washed with lysine solution (18.3 g/liter complete growth medium) and then incubated for 15 min in the same solution. The cells were washed with sterile ice-cold PBS and lysed in mammalian protein extraction reagent containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysate was incubated with prewashed avidin beads and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. The complex was washed 3 times with sterile PBS, and proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min at 100 °C in SDS sample buffer. Thirty microliters of the prepared sample was loaded and resolved on 7.5% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels and subject to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as mentioned above but with anti-ENaC α antibody (44Alli A.A. Bao H.F. Alli A.A. Aldrugh Y. Song J.Z. Ma H.P. Yu L. Al-Khalili O. Eaton D.C Phosphatidylinositol phosphate-dependent regulation of Xenopus ENaC by MARCKS protein.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2012; (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:1000. The values obtained from experiments performed in triplicate (n = 3) are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by using the Student's t test at p < 0.05. The 2F3 cell line remains an excellent model system to study the regulation of ENaC using biochemical and electrophysiological approaches. ENaC is known to be activated by various proteases. To determine if 2F3 cells secrete any proteases for which ENaC could be a substrate, media from the apical and basolateral sides of these cells were concentrated and then subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Because the samples were processed extensively to remove contaminants that could potentially minimize resolution and cause vertical and horizontal streaking, spot profiles from the apical and basolateral samples could be analyzed, and the protein spots could be identified by mass spectrometry. The proteins were separated by their isoelectric point in the horizontal direction and then by their molecular weight in the vertical direction. Several spots corresponding to proteins unique to either the apical or basolateral sides were excised and subject to mass spectrometry sequencing for protein identification. Fig. 1 shows one such protein spot that was found on the apical side but not the basolateral side. Mass spectrometry analysis of this protein spot revealed multiple signature peptides corresponding to cathepsin B. To determine whether each of the three structurally similar but distinct ENaC subunits could be substrates of cathepsin B, we first subcloned the full Xenopus coding sequence of each subunit into a bacterial expression vector comprising a GST tag. Recombinant fusion proteins can be valuable resources in many different applications because they can serve as a renewable source of purified protein and they can be obtained in large quantities. However, expression of foreign proteins in bacterial systems and particularly those proteins with hydrophobic domains often pose problems because they tend to aggregate in bacterial inclusion bodies. Each of the ENaC subunits contains two transmembrane domains and aggregated in inclusion bodies. Using a system previously described by Alli and Gower (42Alli A.A. Gower Jr., W.R. Molecular approaches to examine the phosphorylation state of the C type natriuretic peptide receptor.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 110: 985-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we expressed each ENaC subunit as a GST fusion protein and then purified them from bacterial inclusion bodies. The expression of foreign proteins in a bacterial system may result in the protein being prematurely cleaved by host proteases, and the purification of those proteins often results in copurification of host proteins. Therefore, we excised protein bands that corresponded to each of the three ENaC subunits from Coomassie-stained gels and confirmed the identity and coverage of the proteins by mass spectrometry. Mascot reports of the mass spectral data revealed multiple large signature peptides corresponding to ENaC γ (Fig. 2C), ENaC β (Fig. 3C), and ENaC α (Fig. 4C). Of the two proteins bands excised from Coomassie-stained gels after SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant GST ENaC γ (Fig. 2B), the lower molecular weight band represents ENaC γ without the GST moiety, whereas the higher molecular weight band represents ENaC γ with the GST moiety (Fig. 2C). The mass spectrometry sequence coverage did not reveal any mutations or sequence coverage for the GST moiety of any of the ENaC subunit fusion proteins. The fusion proteins were used to perform in vitro cathepsin B cleavage experiments. The GST ENaC γ fusion protein was subject to treatment with or without active cathepsin B protease. Coomassie-stained gels and Western blot analysis demonstrated a stained and immunoreactive band, respectively, of 100 kDa for ENaC γ fusion protein (Fig. 2). Further analysis revealed the GST ENaC γ subunit fusion was not cleaved by cathepsin B (Fig. 2). Similar to GST ENaC γ, Coomassie-stained gels and Western blot analysis demonstrated a stained and immunoreactive band, respectively, of 100 kDa for ENaC β fusion protein (Fig. 3). Also, further analysis revealed the GST ENaC β subunit fusion was not cleaved by cathepsin B.

In contrast to most of the other enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, a deficiency of ECI1 has yet to be identified in humans. We used wild-type (WT) and Eci1-deficient knockout (KO) mice to explore a potential presentation of human ECI1 deficiency. Upon food withdrawal, Eci1-deficient mice displayed normal blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels (WT 1.09 mM vs. KO 1.10 mM), a trend to lower blood glucose levels (WT 4.58 mM vs. KO 3.87 mM, P=0.09) and elevated blood levels of unsaturated acylcarnitines, in particular C12:1 acylcarnitine (WT 0.03 μM vs. KO 0.09 μM, P<0.01). Feeding an olive oil-rich diet induced an even greater increase in C12:1 acylcarnitine levels (WT 0.01 μM vs. KO 0.04 μM, P<0.01). Overall, the phenotypic presentation of Eci1-deficient mice is mild, possibly caused by the presence of a second enoyl-CoA isomerase (Eci2) in mitochondria. Knockdown of Eci2 in Eci1-deficient fibroblasts caused a more pronounced accumulation of C12:1 acylcarnitine on incubation with unsaturated fatty acids (12-fold, P<0.05). We conclude that Eci2 compensates for Eci1 deficiency explaining the mild phenotype of Eci1-deficient mice. Hypoglycemia and accumulation of C12:1 acylcarnitine might be diagnostic markers to identify ECI1 deficiency in humans.—van Weeghel, M., te Brinke, H., van Lenthe, H., Kulik, W., Minkler, P.

Human aldo-keto reductases catalyze the metabolic activation of proximate carcinogenic PAH trans-dihydrodiols to yield electrophilic and redox-active o-quinones. Benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dione a representative PAH o-quinone is reduced back to the corresponding catechol to generate a futile redox-cycle. We investigated whether sulfonation of PAH catechols by human sulfotransferases (SULT) could intercept the catechol in human lung cells. RT-PCR identified SULT1A1, -1A3, and -1E1 as the isozymes expressed in four human lung cell lines. The corresponding recombinant SULTs were examined for their substrate specificity. Benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dione was reduced to benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-catechol by dithiothreitol under anaerobic conditions and then further sulfonated by the SULTs in the presence of 3'-[(35)S]phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate as the sulfonate group donor. The human SULTs catalyzed the sulfonation of benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-catechol and generated two isomeric benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-catechol O-monosulfate products that were identified by reversed phase HPLC and by LC-MS/MS. The various SULT isoforms produced the two isomers in different proportions. Two-dimensional (1)H and (13)C NMR assigned the two regioisomers of benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-catechol monosulfate as 8-hydroxy-benzo[a]pyrene-7-O-sulfate (M1) and 7-hydroxy-benzo[a]pyrene-8-O-sulfate (M2), respectively. The kinetic profiles of three SULTs were different. SULT1A1 gave the highest catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) and yielded a single isomeric product corresponding to M1. By contrast, SULT1E1 showed distinct substrate inhibition and formed both M1 and M2. Based on expression levels, catalytic efficiency, and the fact that the lung cells only produce M1, it is concluded that the major isoform that can intercept benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-catechol is SULT1A1."

This binding can be prevented by MORAb-009, a humanized monoclonal antibody against mesothelin currently under clinical trials. We show here that MORAb-009 recognizes a non-linear epitope that is contained in the first 64-residue fragment of the mesothelin.

https://openalex.org/W2125223687,"Cholera toxin (CT) travels from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as an AB holotoxin. ER-specific conditions then promote the dissociation of the catalytic CTA1 subunit from the rest of the toxin. CTA1 is held in a stable conformation by its assembly in the CT holotoxin, but the dissociated CTA1 subunit is an unstable protein that spontaneously assumes a disordered state at physiological temperature. This unfolding event triggers the ER-to-cytosol translocation of CTA1 through the quality control mechanism of ER-associated degradation. The translocated pool of CTA1 must regain a folded, active structure to modify its G protein target which is located in lipid rafts at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Here, we report that lipid rafts place disordered CTA1 in a functional conformation. The hydrophobic C-terminal domain of CTA1 is essential for binding to the plasma membrane and lipid rafts. These interactions inhibit the temperature-induced unfolding of CTA1. Moreover, lipid rafts could promote a gain of structure in the disordered, 37 °C conformation of CTA1. This gain of structure corresponded to a gain of function: whereas CTA1 by itself exhibited minimal in vitro activity at 37 °C, exposure to lipid rafts resulted in substantial toxin activity at 37 °C. In vivo, the disruption of lipid rafts with filipin substantially reduced the activity of cytosolic CTA1. Lipid rafts thus exhibit a chaperone-like function that returns disordered CTA1 to an active state and is required for the optimal in vivo activity of CTA1."
https://openalex.org/W2066423449,"The investigation goal was to identify mechanisms for reversal of actin S-nitrosylation in neutrophils after exposure to high oxygen partial pressures. Prior work has shown that hyperoxia causes S-nitrosylated actin (SNO-actin) formation, which mediates β2 integrin dysfunction, and these changes can be reversed by formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine or 8-bromo-cyclic GMP. Herein we show that thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is responsible for actin denitrosylation. Approximately 80% of cellular TrxR is localized to the cytosol, divided between the G-actin and short filamentous actin (sF-actin) fractions based on Triton solubility of cell lysates.

Hyperoxia increases production of reactive species derived from nitric-oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase, which cause S-nitrosylation of β-actin (26Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Mancini D.J.

HBO2-exposed cells exhibit greater actin filament (F-actin) turnover, which inhibits β2 integrin clustering and thus β2 integrin adhesion (26Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Mancini D.J. Milovanova T.N.

Vasodilator-stimulated protein (VASP) has high affinity for S-nitrosylated short filamentous actin (sF-actin) (27Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Yang M. Bogush M. Huang S. Milovanova T.

VASP bundles Rac 1, Rac 2, and cyclic AMP-dependent and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases in close proximity to sF-actin, and subsequent Rac activation increases actin free barbed end formation. fMLP and 8-bromo-cyclic GMP (8-Br-cGMP) reverse these events because they activate, respectively, either cyclic AMP-dependent or cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase outside of the sF-actin pool, which phosphorylates VASP. This reduces VASP affinity for sF-actin. Decreased VASP binding to actin resolves the elevated Rac activity and abrogates the augmented polymerization normally observed with S-nitrosylated actin. Thus, fMLP and 8-Br-cGMP can restore normal β2 integrin function. Demonstrating restoration of function with the bacterial product fMLP provides a partial explanation for why HBO2 does not cause immunocompromise despite improving outcomes from some inflammatory and reperfusion injuries (28Thom S.R.

HBO2-exposed neutrophils no longer exhibit elevated content of S-nitrosylated actin (SNO-actin) after incubation with fMLP or 8-Br-cGMP (26Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Mancini D.J. Milovanova T.N.

Identifying how actin S-nitrosylation is reversed was the goal for the current research effort. Denitrosylation of cytosolic proteins is performed by NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) and NADH-dependent S-nitrosoglutathione reductase. A third enzyme, NADH-dependent lipoamide dehydrogenase, is a part of the α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex in mitochondria, where it denitrosylates low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols; only a small fraction of the enzyme is found in cytosol (30Stoyanovsky D.A.

TrxR, lipoamide dehydrogenase, and glutathione reductase can reduce the disulfide lipoic acid (5-[1,2]-dithiolan-3-yl-pentanoic acid) to dihydrolipoic acid, which will denitrosylate proteins (30Stoyanovsky D.A.

Bidirectional integrin-actin communications are required for proper cell functioning, and coordination of many of these activities involves focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (38Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K.

FAK consists of an N-terminal FERM (band four point one radixin, ezrin, moesin) homology domain, followed by a tyrosine kinase domain and a C-terminal focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain. The exact function of FAK in neutrophils has not been clearly defined, but in most cell types, FAK is predominantly a scaffolding protein. It appears to modulate integrin-cytoskeletal associations, and it may enhance actin polymerization (42Serrels B. Serrels A. Brunton V.G. Holt M. McLean G.W. Gray C.H. Jones G.E. Frame M.C.

The purpose of this investigation was to elucidate the mechanism for SNO-actin removal in cells exposed to fMLP or 8-Br-cGMP. In the course of these studies, a central role for TrxR was identified. As work progressed, it became clear that FAK played a role in modulating TrxR intracellular localization and activity. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide and streptavidin-agarose were purchased from Prozyme (Hayward, CA). HisPurTM cobalt resin was purchased from Thermo Scientific/Pierce. PF 573228 (3,4-dihydro-6-[[4-[[[3-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]methyl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-2(1H)-quinolinone) was purchased from Tocris/R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Ultrafree-MC filters, PVDF Immobilon-FL, and ZipTipC18P10 were from Millipore Corp. Antibodies were purchased from the following vendors: anti-biotin and anti-actin (Sigma), anti-FAK (BD Biosciences), and anti-TrxR1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The following small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) sequences were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.: a control, scrambled sequence siRNA that will not cause specific degradation of any known cellular mRNA (UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU); TrxR1 siRNA, a mixture of three sequences identified as strand A (CUUGGCUAAUCUACUUGAA), strand B (GGAAGCUGUUCAUAACGUA), and strand C (GAAGCUGUUCAUAACGUAA); FAK siRNA, a mixture of three sequences, strand A (GCAUCCUGAAAUUCUUUGA), strand B (CCAGUACUCAAACAGUGAA), and strand C (CGACCAGGGAUUAUGAGAU; S-nitrosoglutathione reductase siRNA, a pool of three different siRNA duplexes, strand A (sense, CAUGAAGUUCGGAUUAAGAtt; antisense, UCUUAAUCCGAACUUCAUGtt), strand B (sense, GCAUAAUCGAGACUGUAAUtt; antisense, AUUACAGUCUCGAUUAUGCtt), and strand C (sense, CAUCCACAUGGGUUUAGAAtt; antisense, UUCUAAACCCAUGUGGAUGtt); and glutathione reductase siRNA, also a pool of three different siRNA duplexes, strand A (sense, CCAUGAUUCCAGAUGUUGAtt; antisense, UCAACAUCUGGAAUCAUGGtt), strand B (sense, CGAAGCUGUUCAUAAGUAUtt; antisense, AUACUUAUGAACAGCUUCGtt), and strand C (sense, GUACAUGACAUACACUCAAtt; antisense, UUGAGUGUAUGUCAUGUACtt). Mice (Mus musculus) were purchased (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), fed a standard rodent diet and water ad libitum, and housed in the animal facility of the University of Pennsylvania. After anesthesia (intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg)), skin was prepared by swabbing with Betadine, and blood was obtained into heparinized syringes by aortic puncture. Mice were anesthetized, and neutrophils were isolated from heparinized blood as described previously (26Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Mancini D.J. Milovanova T.N.

A concentration of 5 × 105 neutrophils/ml of PBS plus 5.5 mm glucose was exposed to either air or 2.0 ATA O2 for 45 min (we have shown that ex vivo exposures to 1 or 2 ATA O2 are equivalent to in vivo exposures to 2.8 ATA (26Thom S.R.

After air/O2 exposures but prior to specific studies, cell suspensions were incubated for 10 min with a chemical agonist or inhibitor or exposed for 5 min to UV light from a 200-watt mercury vapor lamp. Where indicated, after air/O2 exposures but before studies, cells were incubated for 20 h at room temperature with siRNA following the manufacturer's instructions using control, scrambled sequence siRNA that will not lead to specific degradation of any known cellular mRNA or siRNA specific for mouse TrxR1, glutathione reductase, S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, or FAK. Pilot studies demonstrated that concentrations of 0.08 nm achieved maximum decreases in protein levels. Preparation and use of fibrinogen-coated plates to measure β2 integrin-specific neutrophil adherence in calcein AM-loaded cells was as described previously (26Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Mancini D.J.

Suspensions of 25,000 cells in 100 μl of PBS were added to plate wells containing either PBS or solutions, so that once added, cells would be exposed to 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP or 100 nm fMLP. At the end of the 10-min incubation, wells were washed, and adherence was calculated as described previously (26Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Mancini D.J. Milovanova T.N.

Isolated neutrophils previously exposed to air (control) or HBO2 were suspended in 2 ml of HEN buffer (250 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm neocuproine), sonicated on ice for 30 s, and then passed through a 28-gauge needle five times. Lysates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, supernatant was recovered, and samples were made 0.4% CHAPS using the 10% stock solution. The biotin switch assay was carried out following published methods, including 20 nm CuCl2, as recommended by others (26Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Mancini D.J. Milovanova T.N.

It should be noted that biotinylation impedes antibody recognition of actin on Western blots so that small portions of cell preparation are not subjected to biotin switch procedures in order to quantify the total amount of actin present in each cell sample. Isolated neutrophils exposed to air or HBO2 were placed on slides coated with fibrinogen following published methods (26Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Mancini D.J. Milovanova T.N.

Cells were permeabilized by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were then incubated overnight with 1:200 dilutions of Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin plus primary antibodies to either FAK or TrxR. The next morning slides were rinsed three times with PBS and counterstained with a 1:500 dilution of APC and RPE-conjugated secondary antibodies. Images of neutrophils were acquired using a Zeiss Meta510 confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4 numerical aperture oil objective. Fluorophore excitation was provided by 488- and 543-nm laser lines, and resulting fluorescence was separated using 500–530- and 560–615-nm band pass filters. Neutrophils were processed following our published protocol (26Thom S.R. Bhopale V.M. Mancini D.J. Milovanova T.N. Acti"
https://openalex.org/W2003504970,"Ankyrins (ankyrin-R, -B, and -G) are adapter proteins linked with defects in metazoan physiology. Ankyrin-B (encoded by ANK2) loss-of-function mutations are directly associated with human cardiovascular phenotypes including sinus node disease, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death. Despite the link between ankyrin-B dysfunction and monogenic disease, there are no data linking ankyrin-B regulation with common forms of human heart failure. Here, we report that ankyrin-B levels are altered in both ischemic and non-ischemic human heart failure. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that cardiac ankyrin-B levels are tightly regulated downstream of reactive oxygen species, intracellular calcium, and the calcium-dependent protease calpain, all hallmarks of human myocardial injury and heart failure. Surprisingly, β(II)-spectrin, previously thought to mediate ankyrin-dependent modulation in the nervous system and heart, is not coordinately regulated with ankyrin-B or its downstream partners. Finally, our data implicate ankyrin-B expression as required for vertebrate myocardial protection as hearts deficient in ankyrin-B show increased cardiac damage and impaired function relative to wild-type mouse hearts following ischemia reperfusion. In summary, our findings provide the data of ankyrin-B regulation in human heart failure, provide insight into candidate pathways for ankyrin-B regulation in acquired human cardiovascular disease, and surprisingly, implicate ankyrin-B as a molecular component for cardioprotection following ischemia."

We describe here two crystal structures of Bacillus subtilis QueF, one of the wild-type enzyme in complex with the substrate preQ(0), trapped as a covalent thioimide, a putative intermediate in the reaction, and the second of the C55A mutant in complex with the substrate preQ(0) bound noncovalently. The QueF enzyme forms an asymmetric tunnel-fold homodecamer of two head-to-head facing pentameric subunits, harboring 10 active sites at the intersubunit interfaces. In both structures, a preQ(0) molecule is bound at eight sites, and in the wild-type enzyme, it forms a thioimide covalent linkage to the catalytic residue Cys-55. Both structural and transient kinetic data show that preQ(0) binding, not thioimide formation, induces a large conformational change in and closure of the active site. Based on these data, we propose a mechanism for the activation of the Cys-55 nucleophile and subsequent hydride transfer."

This atypical function of TrkA is still largely unknown and is of keen interest in light of the fact that high expression of TrkA is strongly correlated with positive prognosis in neuroblastoma patients (3Brodeur G.M.

CCM2 is a cytoplasmic protein composed of two domains, an N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain and a C-terminal region with no obvious structural homologies or known function, termed the Karet domain (4Harel L. Costa B. Tcherpakov M. Zapatka M. Oberthuer A. Hansford L.M. Vojvodic M. Levy Z. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Avigad S. Yaniv I. Shi L. Eils R. Fischer M. Brors B. Kaplan D.R. Fainzilber M. CCM2 mediates death signaling by the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase.Neuron. 2009; 63: 585-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CCM2 interacts with TrkA via its PTB domain, but the interacting epitope in TrkA lacks phosphorylatable residues, suggesting that CCM2 serves as an adaptor that links to downstream effectors rather than directly impacting on TrkA signaling. Because both the PTB and the Karet domains of CCM2 are required for mediation of TrkA death signaling (4Harel L. Costa B. Tcherpakov M. Zapatka M. Oberthuer A. Hansford L.M. Vojvodic M. Levy Z. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Avigad S. Yaniv I. Shi L. Eils R. Fischer M. Brors B. Kaplan D.R. Fainzilber M. CCM2 mediates death signaling by the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase.Neuron. 2009; 63: 585-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the Karet domain links TrkA-CCM2 to downstream effectors. Here we describe a proteomics screen for interactors of the Karet domain of CCM2, leading to identification of STK25 as an effector of death signaling initiated by TrkA and CCM2.

HEK293 Flp-In T-REx derivatives expressing FLAG-tagged versions of CCM2 domains (supplemental Fig. S1A) were generated as described previously (9Dunham W.H. Larsen B. Tate S. Badillo B.G.

High confidence interactions were further defined as those identified with at least 20 spectra after removal of promiscuously interacting proteins (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). STK25 was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with equimolar amounts of GST-CCM2, CCM3, or myelin basic protein in kinase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 200 μm ATP, and 1.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and imaged. Phosphorylation sites on CCM2 were identified by mass spectrometry as described in supplemental Table S3. Gene expression data from 478 primary neuroblastoma were analyzed as described previously (4Harel L. Costa B. Tcherpakov M. Zapatka M. Oberthuer A. Hansford L.M. Vojvodic M. Levy Z. Chen Z.Y.

Lausen B. On the exact distribution of maximally selected rank statistics.Comput Stat. Data Anal. 2003; 43: 121-137Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar) for high versus low risk tumors. A 10-fold cross-validation was performed. Thresholds for high versus low expression were derived from the mean values of the cross-validation. We sought new effectors of the TrkA-CCM2 death pathway. To this end, we generated tetracycline-inducible isogenic HEK cells stably expressing either full-length CCM2 or its PTB or Karet domains, fused to a FLAG epitope at the N terminus (supplemental Fig. S1A). Stable transfectants were selected and tested for expression of FLAG-CCM2, FLAG-Karet, and FLAG-PTB. Expression was induced in subconfluent cells for 24 h followed by FLAG immunoprecipitation of cell lysates, proteolytic digestion, and peptide identification by mass spectrometry. High confidence interactors for CCM2 or its subdomains are detailed in Fig. 1A and supplemental Tables S1 and S2. In addition to the previously reported interactors CCM1, CCM3, and ICAP1 (6Faurobert E. Albiges-Rizo C. Recent insights into cerebral cavernous malformations: a complex jigsaw puzzle under construction.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 1084-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we found CCM2 or its subdomains interacting with MST4, STK24, and STK25, all members of the germinal center kinase class III (GCKIII) family. STK24 and STK25 appeared to co-precipitate specifically with the Karet domain in these assays and were previously implicated in death signaling (12Nogueira E. Fidalgo M. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. Zalvide J. Pombo C.M. SOK1 translocates from the Golgi to the nucleus upon chemical anoxia and induces apoptotic cell death.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16248-16258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. Activation of a human Ste20-like kinase by oxidant stress defines a novel stress response pathway.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); hence we focused on these two kinases. We verified STK24 and STK25 interactions with CCM2 by co-immunoprecipitations (co-IPs) from transfected HEK or HeLa cells. HA tagged-CCM2 co-precipitated with FLAG-STK24 or FLAG-STK25 (Fig. 1B). The STK24 and STK25 interactions with CCM2 were confirmed in reverse co-IPs using HA antibody for immunoprecipitation (IP) and FLAG for Western blots (Fig. 1C). It is noteworthy that TrkA is also co-precipitated with STK24 or STK25 (Fig. 1B), either in the presence or in the absence of transfected HA-CCM2 (HEK cells express endogenous CCM2). Finally, we used isogenic HEK cells expressing FLAG-tagged CCM2 under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter to further assess CCM2-STK25 interactions at close to endogenous protein levels. STK24 was expressed at much lower levels than STK25 in these cells; hence the experiment was restricted to STK25. In the absence of tetracycline, these cells expressed low basal levels of FLAG-CCM2. Indeed, an interaction between basal levels of FLAG-CCM2 and endogenous STK25 could be detected under these conditions (Fig. 1D), and both STK25-GFP and CCM2-RFP were localized in the cytoplasm in transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). The affinity proteomics approach used in our screen identified an interaction between the Karet domain of CCM2 and STK24 or STK25. To determine whether this interaction is specific for the Karet domain, we co-transfected the two CCM2 subdomains into HEK cells together with FLAG-tagged-STK24 or STK25. Interestingly, both CCM2 subdomains were co-precipitated with either STK24 or STK25 (Fig. 1E), indicating that there may be multiple points of interaction between CCM2 to GCKIII kinases, or alternatively, that these interactions occur within the framework of a larger complex. We tested whether STK24 and STK25 might play a role in TrkA-induced cell death by down-regulating their expression in the medulloblastoma cell line MB-TrkA, which undergoes cell death upon NGF treatment (7Muragaki Y. Chou T.T. Kaplan D.R. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Nerve growth factor induces apoptosis in human medulloblastoma cell lines that express TrkA receptors.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 530-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Effective reduction of expression levels was achieved using lentiviral shRNAs against STK24 or STK25 in MB-TrkA cells (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2). Down-regulation of STK24 did not affect NGF-induced death of MB-TrkA cells, and similar levels of viability were observed in control and in STK24-down-regulated cells (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast, down-regulation of STK25 in MB-TrkA cells protected them from NGF-induced TrkA-dependent cell death (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S2). The anti-STK25 shRNA targets the 3′-UTR region in the endogenous transcript; hence we used a construct containing the ORF of STK25 fused to GFP to express STK25 that is not affected by the shRNA (supplemental Fig. S2). Expression of STK25-GFP in MB-TrkA cells did not affect viability of the cells in the absence of NGF treatment (data not shown); however, transfection with the STK25-GFP construct restored sensitivity of shRNA-treated MB-TrkA cells to NGF-induced death (Fig. 2B), confirming that the shRNA effect is specific for STK25. Moreover, NGF treatment caused an increase in STK25 protein levels in MB-TrkA cells, but had no effect on STK24 levels (supplemental Fig. S2). Finally, we found that STK25 transfection induces death in HEK cells, as reported previously (12Nogueira E. Fidalgo M. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. Zalvide J. Pombo C.M. SOK1 translocates from the Golgi to the nucleus upon chemical anoxia and induces apoptotic cell death.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16248-16258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and that STK25-induced death is increased upon co-transfection with TrkA and CCM2 (supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast, we did not observe death of HEK cells upon STK24 transfection either alone or in combination with TrkA and CCM2 (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, although both STK24 and STK25 can interact with CCM2, only STK25 mediated TrkA-CCM2-dependent death. We then examined mRNA expression levels of STK24 and STK25 in correlation with clinical outcome in 478 neuroblastoma patients. TrkA and CCM2 expression was previously shown to correlate with good prognosis in this cohort (4Harel L. Costa B. Tcherpakov M. Zapatka M. Oberthuer A. Hansford L.M. Vojvodic M. Levy Z. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Avigad S. Yaniv I. Shi L. Eils R. Fischer M. Brors B. Kaplan D.R. Fainzilber M. CCM2 mediates death signaling by the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase.Neuron. 2009; 63: 585-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Expression levels of STK25, but not STK24, were significantly correlated with those of TrkA and CCM2 (Pearson's correlation, r(STK25,CCM2) = 0.41, p < 2 × 10−16; r(STK25,TrkA) = 0.23, p < 2 × 10−7). We then defined tumor expression level thresholds for STK25 and STK24, as described previously (4Harel L. Costa B. Tcherpakov M. Zapatka M. Oberthuer A. Hansford L.M. Vojvodic M. Levy Z. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Avigad S. Yaniv I. Shi L. Eils R. Fischer M. Brors B. Kaplan D.R. Fainzilber M. CCM2 mediates death signaling by the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase.Neuron. 2009; 63: 585-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and determined correlation with patient survival. A significantly better outcome was observed for patients with STK25 expression values above the threshold, whereas in contrast, higher expression levels of STK24 correlated with unfavorable clinical outcome (Fig. 2C). These data support a role for STK25, but not STK24, in TrkA-dependent retreat of neuroblastoma in patients in vivo. To determine whether NGF regulates STK25 activity, we examined phosphorylation of Thr-174 in STK25 after NGF stimulation of MB-TrkA cells. STK25 phosphorylation increased upon NGF treatment, in parallel with an increase in co-precipitation of STK25 with TrkA (Fig. 3). NGF treatment also increased CCM2 co-precipitation with STK25 (Fig. 3). We then sought to further characterize the STK25-CCM2 interaction with the help of specific constructs mutated at residues affecting kinase activity of the protein (14Preisinger C. Short B. De Corte V. Bruyneel E. Haas A. Kopajtich R. Gettemans J. Barr F.A. YSK1 is activated by the Golgi matrix protein GM130 and plays a role in cell migration through its substrate 14-3-3ζ.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1009-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Two activity-reducing mutants (T174A and K49R) and one constitutively active kinase mutant (T174D) co-precipitated with CCM2 in a similar manner as wild type STK25, whereas another kinase-reducing mutation, D158A, revealed a much reduced interaction with CCM2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, although kinase activity per se is not required for the interaction, Asp-158 in STK25 facilitates efficient CCM2 co-precipitation. A kinase activity assay demonstrated CCM2 phosphorylation by STK25 (Fig. 4C). Mass spectrometric analyses further revealed Ser-384 as the major site for CCM2 phosphorylation by STK25 (Fig. 4D), in addition to four less prominent sites (supplemental Table S3). We therefore tested whether STK25 kinase activity is required for TrkA-dependent death. MB-TrkA cells with reduced STK25 expression were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA-resistant STK25 constructs, either the wild type or the K49R kinase-dead mutant (supplemental Fig. S2D). There was no reduction in the viability of NGF-treated cells expressing the K49R mutant (Fig. 4E), indicating that STK25 kinase activity is required for TrkA-CCM2-dependent death in medulloblastoma cells. We have previously shown that CCM2 is a cytoplasmic interactor of TrkA that is necessary for NGF-induced cell death in pediatric tumor cells (4Harel L. Costa B. Tcherpakov M. Zapatka M. Oberthuer A. Hansford L.M. Vojvodic M. Levy Z. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Avigad S. Yaniv I. Shi L. Eils R. Fischer M. Brors B. Kaplan D.R. Fainzilber M. CCM2 mediates death signaling by the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase.Neuron. 2009; 63: 585-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we found that the GCKIII serine-threonine kinases STK24, STK25, and MST4 are new molecular partners of CCM2, and we identified a role for STK25 in TrkA-CCM2-dependent cell death in medulloblastoma cells. Although all three GCKIII kinases were identified as CCM2 interactors in our screen, initial results with the Karet domain directed our focus to STK24 and STK25. Further experiments revealed that both the PTB and the Karet domains of CCM2 interact with STK24 and STK25 and that STK25 can phosphorylate CCM2. Interestingly, GCKIII kinases are known to interact with CCM3 (10Goudreault M. D'Ambrosio L.M. Kean M.J. Mullin M.J. Larsen B.G. Sanchez A. Chaudhry S. Chen G.I. Sicheri F. Nesvizhskii A.I.

Cell. 2007; 18: 1965-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and CCM3 was also reported to be an STK25 substrate (15Voss K. Stahl S. Schleider E. Ullrich S. Nickel J. Mueller T.D. Felbor U. CCM3 interacts with CCM2 indicating common pathogenesis for cerebral cavernous malformations.Neurogenetics. 2007; 8: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A recent phosphorylation mapping study on a CCM1-associated complex demonstrated multiple phosphorylation sites on CCM2 (17Kim J. Sherman N.E. Fox J.W. Ginsberg M.H. Phosphorylation sites in the cerebral cavernous malformations complex.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 3929-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); however, to date, the kinases involved in CCM2 phosphorylation are not known. Our results suggest that STK25 is likely one of the serine/threonine kinases responsible for CCM2 phosphorylation. Our data specifically implicate STK25 in NGF-induced cell death in medulloblastoma cells. The apparent specificity of the pathway for STK25 over STK24 is intriguing, given the fact that both these kinases have been implicated in cell death in different systems (18Takeda K. Naguro I. Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Ichijo H. Apoptosis signaling kinases: from stress response to health outcomes.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 15: 719-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). STK25 depletion by RNAi rescues TrkA-expressing medulloblastoma cells from NGF-induced death, whereas similar depletion of STK24 had no effect. Introduction of shRNA-resistant STK25 restored cell death in STK25-silenced cells, whereas the kinase-dead K49R STK25 mutant had no such effect. NGF treatment of TrkA-expressing medulloblastoma cells activates STK25 and increases its interactions with both TrkA and CCM2. Finally, STK25 expression levels in tumors correlate with those of CCM2 and TrkA and with good prognosis in neuroblastoma patients. Thus, active STK25 kinase participates in TrkA- and CCM2-mediated death in pediatric tumor cells of neural origin. STK25 was originally identified as an oxidant stress-activated kinase (13Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. Activation of a human Ste20-like kinase by oxidant stress defines a novel stress response pathway.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and subsequently implicated in apoptotic death induced by chemical anoxia (12Nogueira E. Fidalgo M. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. Zalvide J. Pombo C.M. SOK1 translocates from the Golgi to the nucleus upon chemical anoxia and induces apoptotic cell death.J. Biol.

Costa B. Fainzilber M. On the death Trk.Dev. Neurobiol. 2010; 70: 298-303PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of cell death induced by STK25 was suggested to depend on its expression levels (12Nogueira E. Fidalgo M. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. Zalvide J. Pombo C.M.

Costa B. Tcherpakov M. Zapatka M. Oberthuer A. Hansford L.M. Vojvodic M. Levy Z. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Avigad S. Yaniv I. Shi L. Eils R. Fischer M. Brors B. Kaplan D.R. Fainzilber M.

Overexpression of TrkA from the tau locus has been shown to cause extensive neuronal death in vivo (20Nikoletopoulou V. Lickert H. Frade J.M. Rencurel C. Giallonardo P. Zhang L. Bibel M. Barde Y.A. Neurotrophin receptors TrkA and TrkC cause neuronal death, whereas TrkB does not.Nature. 2010; 467: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Caspase activation is required for both CCM2-mediated death in medulloblastoma cells (4Harel L. Costa B. Tcherpakov M. Zapatka M. Oberthuer A. Hansford L.M. Vojvodic M. Levy Z. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Avigad S. Yaniv I. Shi L. Eils R. Fischer M. Brors B. Kaplan D.R. Fainzilber M. CCM2 mediates death signaling by the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase.Neuron. 2009; 63: 585-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and STK25-mediated cell death after chemical anoxia (12Nogueira E.

Thus, the TrkA-CCM2-STK25 pathway likely represents a switch mechanism activated by correlated and increased expression, leading to activation of canonical apoptosis pathways. Future elucidation of the mechanisms underlying this selectivity should provide new avenues to target pediatric tumors of neural origin.

https://openalex.org/W2041747097,"We previously identified a novel polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) gene, which is designated Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosome region 17 (WBSCR17) because it is located in the chromosomal flanking region of the Williams-Beuren syndrome deletion. Recent genome-scale analysis of HEK293T cells treated with a high concentration of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) demonstrated that WBSCR17 was one of the up-regulated genes possibly involved in endocytosis (Lau, K. S., Khan, S., and Dennis, J. W. (2008) Genome-scale identification of UDP-GlcNAc-dependent pathways. Proteomics 8, 3294–3302). To assess its roles, we first expressed recombinant WBSCR17 in COS7 cells and demonstrated that it was N-glycosylated and localized mainly in the Golgi apparatus, as is the case for the other GalNAc-Ts. Assay of recombinant WBSCR17 expressed in insect cells showed very low activity toward typical mucin peptide substrates. We then suppressed the expression of endogenous WBSCR17 in HEK293T cells using siRNAs and observed phenotypic changes of the knockdown cells with reduced lamellipodium formation, altered O-glycan profiles, and unusual accumulation of glycoconjugates in the late endosomes/lysosomes. Analyses of endocytic pathways revealed that macropinocytosis, but neither clathrin- nor caveolin-dependent endocytosis, was elevated in the knockdown cells. This was further supported by the findings that the overexpression of recombinant WBSCR17 stimulated lamellipodium formation, altered O-glycosylation, and inhibited macropinocytosis. WBSCR17 therefore plays important roles in lamellipodium formation and the regulation of macropinocytosis as well as lysosomes. Our study suggests that a subset of O-glycosylation produced by WBSCR17 controls dynamic membrane trafficking, probably between the cell surface and the late endosomes through macropinocytosis, in response to the nutrient concentration as exemplified by environmental GlcNAc. We previously identified a novel polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) gene, which is designated Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosome region 17 (WBSCR17) because it is located in the chromosomal flanking region of the Williams-Beuren syndrome deletion. Recent genome-scale analysis of HEK293T cells treated with a high concentration of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) demonstrated that WBSCR17 was one of the up-regulated genes possibly involved in endocytosis (Lau, K. S., Khan, S., and Dennis, J. W. (2008) Genome-scale identification of UDP-GlcNAc-dependent pathways. Proteomics 8, 3294–3302). To assess its roles, we first expressed recombinant WBSCR17 in COS7 cells and demonstrated that it was N-glycosylated and localized mainly in the Golgi apparatus, as is the case for the other GalNAc-Ts. Assay of recombinant WBSCR17 expressed in insect cells showed very low activity toward typical mucin peptide substrates. We then suppressed the expression of endogenous WBSCR17 in HEK293T cells using siRNAs and observed phenotypic changes of the knockdown cells with reduced lamellipodium formation, altered O-glycan profiles, and unusual accumulation of glycoconjugates in the late endosomes/lysosomes. Analyses of endocytic pathways revealed that macropinocytosis, but neither clathrin- nor caveolin-dependent endocytosis, was elevated in the knockdown cells. This was further supported by the findings that the overexpression of recombinant WBSCR17 stimulated lamellipodium formation, altered O-glycosylation, and inhibited macropinocytosis. WBSCR17 therefore plays important roles in lamellipodium formation and the regulation of macropinocytosis as well as lysosomes. Our study suggests that a subset of O-glycosylation produced by WBSCR17 controls dynamic membrane trafficking, probably between the cell surface and the late endosomes through macropinocytosis, in response to the nutrient concentration as exemplified by environmental GlcNAc."

To determine the cellular processes and pathways that are responsible of the caspase-10-induced cell death we have designed a loss-of-function screening system to identify genes that are essential for the lethal phenotype. We observed that the ER-Golgi-localized family of proteins Far, MAPK signaling, the autophagy machinery, and several kinases and phosphatases are essential for caspase-10 toxicity. We also found that the expression of caspase-10 elicits a simultaneous activation of the MAP kinases Fus3, Kss1, and Slt2. Furthermore, the protein Far11, which is a target of MAP kinases, is essential for the dephosphorylation of Atg13 and, consequently, for the induction of autophagy. In addition, Far11 participates in the regulation of the DNA damage response through the dephosphorylation of Rad53. Finally, we have also demonstrated that Far11 is able to physically interact with the phosphatases Pph21, Pph22, and Pph3. Overall, our results indicate that the expression of human caspase-10 in S. cerevisiae activates an intracellular death signal that depends on the Far protein complex and that Far11 may function as a regulator subunit of phosphatases in different processes, thus representing a mechanistic link between them."
https://openalex.org/W1989490298,"The glycine receptor-deficient mutant mouse spastic carries a full-length long interspersed nuclear element (LINE1) retrotransposon in intron 6 of the glycine receptor β subunit gene, Glrb(spa). The mutation arose in the C57BL/6J strain and is associated with skipping of exon 6 or a combination of the exons 5 and 6, thus resulting in a translational frameshift within the coding regions of the GlyR β subunit. The effect of the Glrb(spa) LINE1 insertion on pre-mRNA splicing was studied using a minigene approach. Sequence comparison as well as motif prediction and mutational analysis revealed that in addition to the LINE1 insertion the inactivation of an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) within exon 6 is required for skipping of exon 6. Reconstitution of the ESE by substitution of a single residue was sufficient to prevent exon skipping. In addition to the ESE, two regions within the 5' and 3' UTR of the LINE1 were shown to be critical determinants for exon skipping, indicating that LINE1 acts as efficient modifier of subtle endogenous splicing phenotypes. Thus, the spastic allele of the murine glycine receptor β subunit gene is a two-hit mutation, where the hypomorphic alteration in an ESE is amplified by the insertion of a LINE1 element in the adjacent intron. Conversely, the LINE1 effect on splicing may be modulated by individual polymorphisms, depending on the insertional environment within the host genome."

Expression analysis showed strong expression of SLC7A14 mRNA in these cells. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that SLC7A14 is a lysosomal transporter for cationic amino acids. After degradation of proteins in lysosomes, amino acids have to be carried to the cytoplasm by specialized transport proteins. A lysosomal transport system for cationic amino acids has been described in human skin fibroblasts by Pisoni et al. (1Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. Christensen H.N.

Chem. 1987; 262: 15011-15018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and designated system c. However, its molecular identity has not been identified so far. System c has therapeutic interest because it provides a salvage pathway in the therapy of patients with cystinosis (3Gahl W.A. Thoene J.G. Schneider J.A. Cystinosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In these individuals, the loss of function of the lysosomal cystine transporter cystinosin leads to accumulation of the disulfide cystine, resulting in crystal deposition and cell damage (4Schulman J.D. Bradley K.H. Seegmiller J.E. Cystine: compartmentalization within lysosomes in cystinotic leukocytes.Science. 1969; 166: 1152-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Patients are treated with oral application of the aminothiol cysteamine (5Cairns D. Anderson R.J. Coulthard M. Terry J. Cystinosis and its treatment.Pharm. J. 2002; 269: 615-616Google Scholar, 6Markello T.C. Bernardini I.M. Gahl W.A. Improved renal function in children with cystinosis treated with cysteamine.N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), which enters the cells and lysosomes and forms a mixed disulfide with one cysteine molecule. This mixed disulfide resembles the cationic amino acid l-lysine and is transported out of the lysosome by a system c transporter. Administration is problematic because cysteamine has an offensive taste and smell and has to be taken according to a strict timetable (every 6 h) (7Levtchenko E.N. van Dael C.M. de Graaf-Hess A.C. Wilmer M.J. van den Heuvel L.P. Monnens L.A. Blom H.J. Strict cysteamine dose regimen is required to prevent nocturnal cystine accumulation in cystinosis.Pediatr. Nephrol. 2006; 21: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, better therapeutic substances are needed. The knowledge of the salvage transporter would facilitate screening for such compounds. Because of their substrate specificity for cationic amino acids and their partial localization to lysosomes (at least in overexpressing cells), members of the SLC7 (solute carrier family 7) subfamily of cationic amino acid transporters are potential candidates for system c (8Wolf S. Janzen A. Vékony N. Martiné U. Strand D. Closs E.I. Expression of solute carrier 7A4 (SLC7A4) in the plasma membrane is not sufficient to mediate amino acid transport activity.Biochem.

CATs and HATs: the SLC7 family of amino acid transporters.Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Recently, an orphan protein has been assigned to the SLC7 family as member A14 due to sequence homology. The SLC7 family is divided into two subgroups (9Verrey F. Closs E.I. Wagner C.A. Palacin M. Endou H. Kanai Y. CATs and HATs: the SLC7 family of amino acid transporters.Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The light chains of the heteromeric amino acid transporters (lcHATs) 2The abbreviations used are: lcHATlight chain of heteromeric amino acid transporterhCAThuman cationic amino acid transporterEGFPenhanced GFPTMtransmembrane domain. are predicted to comprise 12 transmembrane domains. They have to associate with a glycoprotein of the SLC3 family (heavy chain) to localize to the plasma membrane. The substrate selectivity and ion coupling of those glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporters are diversified. In contrast, the cationic amino acid transporters are predicted to comprise 14 transmembrane domains, are glycosylated, and localize to the plasma membrane without coexpression of a second protein. They mediate exclusively Na+-independent transport of cationic l-amino acids. SLC7A14 exhibits a higher sequence identity to the human cationic amino acid transporter (hCAT) compared with the lcHAT subfamily (supplemental Fig. 1). It is also predicted to have 14 putative transmembrane domains, relating it even more closely to the hCAT subfamily (10Closs E.I. Boissel J.P. Habermeier A. Rotmann A. Structure and function of cationic amino acid transporters (CATs).J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 213: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In our initial experiments, Xenopus laevis oocytes and U373MG glioblastoma cells expressing an SLC7A14-enhanced GFP (EGFP) fusion protein exhibited an almost exclusive intracellular staining that coincided with the lysosomal marker LysoTracker® in the latter. This suggests that SLC7A14 may represent a lysosomal transport protein. In addition, SLC7A14 was expressed in human skin fibroblasts, where system c has initially been described. We thus hypothesized that SLC7A14 may represent system c. To measure the transport activity of the protein, we first attempted to direct SLC7A14 to the plasma membrane by mutating putative lysosomal targeting sequences, a strategy that has successfully been used in the case of cystinosin (11Kalatzis V. Cherqui S. Antignac C. Gasnier B. Cystinosin, the protein defective in cystinosis, is a H+-driven lysosomal cystine transporter.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5940-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, here we were without success. Therefore, we created a chimera carrying the functional domain of human SLC7A14 in the backbone of hCAT-2. This domain is defined by a stretch of 81 amino acids that resemble the fourth intracellular and fifth extracellular loops and transmembrane domain (TM) 9 and TM10 of all cationic amino acid transporter proteins according to the 14-TM model. It has already been reported that this domain determines the apparent substrate affinity and sensitivity to trans-stimulation (12Habermeier A. Wolf S. Martiné U. Gräf P. Closs E.I.

Chem. 2003; 278: 19492-19499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The latter refers to a transport property typical for carrier proteins and distinguishing them from channels: carriers often work better or even exclusively in an exchange mode as opposed to unidirectional transport. This can be seen by acceleration of transport by substrate at the trans-side of the membrane (the side to which substrate is transported) and is referred to as trans-stimulation. The hCAT-2/A14_BK chimera mediated arginine transport and was characterized regarding its localization, substrate affinity, pH dependence, trans-stimulation properties, and substrate specificity. The results from these experiments support the notion that SLC7A14 may indeed represent a system c transporter. light chain of heteromeric amino acid transporter human cationic amino acid transporter enhanced GFP transmembrane domain. The U373MG glioblastoma cell line was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Stably transfected cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with GlutaMAX, 10% FBS, and 0.2 mg/ml G418. Human skin fibroblasts were a kind gift from Martijn Wilmer (Department of Pharmacology/Toxicology, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) and were cultured in M199 medium, 10% FCS, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Total RNA from human cells was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The expression of amino acid transporters and GAPDH (used as a reference) was determined using a QuantiTect RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and specific TaqMan hybridization probes as described (13Rotmann A. Simon A. Martiné U. Habermeier A. Closs E.I. Activation of classical protein kinase C decreases transport via systems y+ and y+L.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C2259-C2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides and hybridization probe were used to detect SLC7A14: ss, 5′-CTGGTGAACATCTATCTCATGC-3′; as, 5′-CTGTTCCAGATGCCATATCC-3′; and TaqMan probe, 5′-6-FAM-AAGCTCTCCACCATCACATGGATCC-TAMRA-Q-3′. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Restriction sites for BamHI and KpnI were introduced or deleted in the SLC7A14-coding sequence as silent mutations. The sequence of each oligonucleotide pair is presented in supplemental Table I. The introduction of BamHI sites into the hCAT-2A and hCAT-1 sequences and other chimeras have been described previously (4Schulman J.D. Bradley K.H. Seegmiller J.E. Cystine: compartmentalization within lysosomes in cystinotic leukocytes.Science. 1969; 166: 1152-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This and a conserved KpnI site were used to create chimeric cDNAs between SLC7A14 and hCAT-2. A full-length cDNA clone from human KIAA1613/SLC7A14 (IRAKp961A1742Q2) was obtained from imaGenes (Source BioScience LifeScience, Berlin, Germany). The fluorescent protein fusion construct for mammalian expression was realized by amplification of the cDNA insert of human SLC7A14 by PCR (HotStar HiFidelity polymerase, Qiagen) using oligonucleotides TCAGATCTCTCAAGATGAGTGGCTTCTTCACCTC (which contains a BglII site (underlined) and a start codon (italic)) and CGACCGGTCGCAACTCTGGAGAGTAATCTAACTC (which removes the stop codon and introduces an AgeI site (underlined)) as sense and antisense primers, respectively, and subcloned into the BglII/AgeI sites of pEGFP-N1. The resulting plasmid was named pSLC7A14-EGFP. Constructs for EGFP fusion proteins with hCAT-2A (3Gahl W.A. Thoene J.G. Schneider J.A. Cystinosis.N. Engl. J.

Cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2 × 108 cells/well) 1 day before transfection. 8 μl of FuGENE HD (Promega) was added to 160 μl of plasmid DNA (2 μg) in water, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was then added dropwise to the cells in 1 ml of medium containing FBS. The cells were incubated with transfection reagent for 48 h at 37 °C. Stably transfected cell clones were selected in medium containing 0.2 mg/ml G418. For each construct, several independent clones were selected. U373MG cells expressing SLC7A14-EGFP were seeded in glass-bottom dishes; stained with 50 nm LysoTracker® Red DND-99, 1 μm MitoTracker® Orange CM-H2TMRos, or 1 μm ER-TrackerTM Red (Invitrogen); and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. All cDNAs were inserted between the SacII and ClaI sites of pSGEM (14Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Subunit stoichiometry of a mammalian K+ channel determined by construction of multimeric cDNAs.Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The plasmids were linearized, and cRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription from the T7 promoter (mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitro transcription kit, Ambion). 10 ng of cRNA in 20 nl of water was injected in each X. laevis oocyte (Dumont stages V and VI). Non-injected oocytes were used as controls. All experiments were performed 3 days after cRNA injection. To measure arginine uptake, oocytes were washed three times with ice-cold uptake solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The oocytes were then transferred to the same solution supplemented with the indicated concentrations of unlabeled l-amino acids (0.01–10 mm) and l-[3H]arginine (10 μCi/ml; ICN). After a 15-min incubation at 20 °C, oocytes were washed five times with ice-cold uptake solution and solubilized individually in 2% SDS. The radioactivity of the lysates was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. For trans-stimulation and efflux experiments, cRNA-injected oocytes were each injected a second time with 3.6 nmol of l-[3H]arginine (3.6 nCi) in 36 nl of water. The oocytes were then immediately transferred into uptake solution (with pH and amino acid concentration as indicated). After a 30-min incubation at 20 °C, the l-[3H]arginine that had accumulated in the extracellular buffer was determined by liquid scintillation counting. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Oocytes were rinsed three times with PBS (0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.76 mm KH2PO4, and 10.1 mm Na2HPO4) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS/CM) and then incubated in PBS/CM containing 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin (EZ-LinkTM, sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min. The biotinylation reaction was stopped by incubating oocytes in PBS/CM containing 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min and rinsing four times with PBS/CM. After lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.15 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.1 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets, Roche), an aliquot of each whole oocyte lysate was mixed directly with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris base, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5% SDS, 0.001% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 8 m urea, and 2% mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Biotinylated surface proteins from the remaining lysate were incubated overnight with avidin-coated Sepharose beads (immobilized NeutrAvidinTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The beads were then washed three times with 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mm, NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS and once with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS. All washing solutions contained 0.2 mm PMSF. Biotinylated proteins were released from the beads by incubation in 1× sample buffer for 10 min at 37 °C and analyzed by Western blotting. Lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto nitrocellulose transfer membranes (Protran 83, Whatman). Staining for EGFPs was achieved by sequential incubations in Blotto (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.01% antifoam A (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk) for 2 h at room temperature to block unspecific binding sites; a 1:3000 dilution of rabbit anti-EGFP antibody (Living Colors® full-length A.v. polyclonal antibody, Clontech) in Blotto overnight at 4 °C; three times in Blotto for 10 min at room temperature; a 1:15,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Calbiochem) in Blotto for 1 h at room temperature; three times in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20; once in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 150 mm NaCl; and finally, in chemiluminescence reagent (Western Lightning® Plus ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 min. Chemiluminescence films (Amersham Biosciences HyperfilmTM ECL, GE Healthcare) were then immediately exposed to the membranes. For standardization, membranes were stained with anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:3000; Sigma-Aldrich) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich). Our initial experiments in which we expressed the orphan protein SLC7A14 in X. laevis oocytes revealed no increase in arginine transport compared with control oocytes (data not shown). To prove protein expression and investigate the subcellular localization of the orphan, we fused EGFP to the C terminus of SLC7A14. Expression of this fusion protein revealed no plasma membrane staining in either X. laevis oocytes or human U373MG glioblastoma cells. In the latter, staining of intracellular vesicles that also lit up with the lysosomal marker LysoTracker® was observed (Fig. 1A). In contrast, overexpressed hCAT-1-EGFP (and all other hCATs) was clearly localized to the plasma membrane in these cells, in addition to intracellular membranes (data not shown). EGFP alone was equally distributed in the cytoplasm (data not shown). SLC7A14 and hCAT-1 coincided in intracellular membranes, but not at the plasma membrane (data not shown). For SLC7A14-EGFP, localization in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum could be excluded by staining of the cells with MitoTracker® and ER-TrackerTM. Western blot analyses revealed that like hCAT proteins (and unlike lcHATs), SLC7A14 was glycosylated (Fig. 1B). As in X. laevis oocytes, overexpression of SLC7A14-EGFP in U373MG cells did not lead to enhanced arginine transport in comparison with control cells (data not shown). We thus hypothesized that SLC7A14 may represent a lysosomal transporter for cationic amino acids as described for human skin fibroblasts and designated system c. In fact, SLC7A14 mRNA was expressed in primary human skin fibroblasts from six different donors (Fig. 2). Related to GAPDH (and assuming equal efficiency of the RT-PCR), mRNA expression of SLC7A14 was about half of that of hCAT-1. hCAT-2B and hCAT-3 mRNA expression was marginal, and hCAT-2A mRNA could not be detected at all. There was no difference in SLC7A14 expression between cystinotic and wild-type cells (data not shown).FIGURE 2mRNA expression of SLC7A14 and hCATs in human skin fibroblasts.

Therefore, a chimera carrying the so-called functional domain of SLC7A14 in the backbone of hCAT-2 was created. This chimera was named hCAT-2/A14_BK, as the exchanged fragment in the respective cDNAs is framed by BamHI and KpnI restriction sites (Fig. 3A). According to the 14-TM model, the SLC7A14 fragment introduced into hCAT-2 comprised the fourth intracellular and fifth extracellular loops, part of TM8, TM9, and TM10 (supplemental Fig. 2). Like hCAT-2A, an EGFP fusion protein of the hCAT-2/A14_BK chimera localized to the plasma membrane of X. laevis oocytes as revealed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B). In contrast, EGFP alone and SLC7A14-EGFP remained intracellular. Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates and cell surface-biotinylated protein fractions confirmed plasma membrane localization of the chimera. In contrast to fluorescence microscopy, this method revealed a very small portion of SLC7A14-EGFP to be localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C). Transport measurements using 1 mm l-[3H]arginine and an incubation time of 15 min (to stay in the linear part of the uptake) (supplemental Fig. 3) demonstrated that the hCAT-2/A14_BK chimera mediated arginine transport (0.61 ± 0.06 compared with 1.38 ± 0.16 nmol of arginine/oocyte/h mediated by hCAT-2A at pH 7.5). The apparent substrate affinity of the chimera was determined at arginine concentrations between 0.01 and 10 mm (Table 1). The arginine concentrations at which half-maximal transport rates were reached (apparent Km) were calculated by fitting the data according to the Eadie-Hofstee equation after subtraction of the values obtained with non-injected oocytes. The apparent affinity of the hCAT-2/A14_BK chimera (Km = 1.93 ± 0.19 mm) was low, similar to the apparent affinity of hCAT-2A (Km = 1.45 ± 0.02 mm). As reported earlier, hCAT-1 exhibited a significantly higher apparent affinity for arginine (Km = 0.6 ± 0.06 mm) (15Closs E.I. Gräf P. Habermeier A. Cunningham J.M. Förstermann U.

This is characteristic for hCAT-1. In the absence of trans-substrate, efflux mediated by the chimera was reduced by 47 ± 4.5% (compared with efflux into buffer containing 1 mm arginine). Although trans-stimulation was not as pronounced as for hCAT-1 (87 ± 0.7% reduced transport without trans-substrate), it was clearly different from hCAT-2A, which exhibited no trans-stimulation. We then asked if pH differences influence the transport activity of the chimera by varying the extracellular pH from 5 to 8.5 in influx experiments. Indeed, the transport activity of the chimera was continually increased from pH 5 to 8.5: transport rates at pH 5 were only 24.7 ± 3.2% of the rates measured at pH 7.5 (Fig. 5A). The pH dependence of the chimera was thus similar to that of hCAT-2 (A or B) and significantly different from that of hCAT-1 (Fig. 5A), which is largely pH-independent (15Closs E.I. Gräf P. Habermeier A. Cunningham J.M. Förstermann U. Human cationic amino acid transporters hCAT-1, hCAT-2A, and hCAT-2B: three related carriers with distinct transport properties.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6462-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Until now, it was not clear if the functional domain also defines the pH dependence of the hCAT proteins. To answer this question, a chimera carrying the functional domain of hCAT-1 in the backbone of hCAT-2 (hCAT-2/1_BK) was investigated. Like hCAT-1, hCAT-2/1_BK was pH-independent (Fig. 5A), suggesting that pH dependence is indeed determined by the functional domain. Arginine efflux mediated by hCAT-2/A14_BK and hCAT-2A was also reduced at extracellular pH 5 compared with pH 7.5, whereas hCAT-1-mediated efflux was again pH-independent (Fig. 5B). Pisoni et al. (2Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. Lemons R.M. Christensen H.N. Important differences in cationic amino acid transport by lysosomal system c and system y+ of the human fibroblast.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15011-15018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified cationic amino acid derivatives that interfere with transport by lysosomal system c, but not system y+. In accordance with these observations, transport of the chimera, but not of hCAT-1, hCAT-2B, and hCAT-3 (all system y+ transporters), was inhibited by ϵ-trimethyl-l-lysine (Fig. 6). However, inhibition of the chimera was less pronounced than reported for system c in human skin fibroblasts (34% versus 50%). Transport by hCAT-2A (which is not expressed in skin fibroblasts and is not a y+ transporter) was inhibited to a similar extent as the chimera. In contrast, hCAT-2/1_BK remained unaffected. This suggests the functional domain to be involved in substrate recognition. To further elucidate this question, we investigated whether histidine recognition is determined by the functional domain. We have previously established that histidine is a substrate for hCAT-1 at low pH (when it carries a positive charge) (19Vékony N. Wolf S. Boissel J.-P. Gnauert K. Closs E.I. Human cationic amino acid transporter hCAT-3 is preferentially expressed in peripheral tissues.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12387-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here we found, that in contrast, hCAT-2A transported only very little histidine under this condition (Fig. 7A). The hCAT-1/2A_BK chimera was very similar to hCAT-2A, supporting the notion that the functional domain is involved in substrate recognition. The rates of histidine transport by the reciprocal chimera hCAT-2/1 were higher compared with hCAT-2A or hCAT-1/2A. However, when related to arginine transport rates (which were higher at pH 5.5 in the transporters carrying the pH-independent functional domain of hCAT-1), histidine recognition by hCAT-2/1 was not different compared with hCAT-2A (Fig. 7B). This suggests that the functional domain is necessary but not sufficient for substrate recognition. The hCAT-2/A14_BK chimera was similar to hCAT-2A in histidine recognition (relative to arginine). The aim of our study was to elucidate the physiological function of SLC7A14, an orphan protein assigned to the amino acid transporter family SLC7 due to sequence homology. Within this family, SLC7A14 is most closely related to the subfamily of cationic amino acid transporters (42–45% identity in amino acid sequence compared with 16–20% identity to the subfamily of lcHATs) (supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, like all hCATs, SLC7A14 is predicted to exhibit 14 TMs by most analysis software. This is in contrast to lcHATS, with only 12 putative TMs. In mammalian cells, SLC7A14 localized almost exclusively to intracellular vesicles that were not stained with MitoTracker® or ER-TrackerTM but with the lysosomal marker LysoTracker®. This is in contrast to all other known hCAT proteins that are clearly residents of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1) (8Wolf S. Janzen A. Vékony N. Martiné U. Strand D. Closs E.I. Expression of solute carrier 7A4 (SLC7A4) in the plasma membrane is not sufficient to mediate amino acid transport activity.Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, hCAT proteins were also found in lysosomes, where they coincided with lysosomal markers. 3I. Jaenecke, J.-P. Boissel, M. Lemke, J. Rupp, B. Gasnier, and E. I. Closs, unpublished data. If they function as amino acid transporters in these compartments remains to be determined. The intracellular localization of SLC7A14 is different from the intracellular localization of lcHATs that are trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum when their respective glycoprotein partner is missing (16Reig N. Chillarón J. Bartoccioni P. Fernández E. Bendahan A. Zorzano A. Kanner B. Palacín M. Bertran J. The light subunit of system bo,+ is fully functional in the absence of the heavy subunit.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, hCAT proteins do not seem to need a partner protein to traffic to the plasma membrane. Using fluorescence microscopy, the SLC7A14-EGFP fusion protein was detected solely in lysosomes also in all other cell types tested (U373 glioblastoma, Huh-7 hepatoma, A673 neuroepithelioma, NT2 teratocarcinoma, and TGW neuroblastoma cells) (data not shown), including two that exhibited endogenous expression of SLC7A14. This was also true when the fluorescent protein DsRed (dimeric or monomeric) was fused to the C or N terminus of SLC7A14, indicating that the subcellular localization is independent of the position or type of fluorescent protein in the fusion protein (data not shown). We found a very small portion of SLC7A14 to be biotinylated at the cell surface of X. laevis oocytes, suggesting that the transporter may first be incorporated into the plasma membrane before it traffics to lysosomes. This has also been observed for other lysosomal proteins (17Janvier K. Bonifacino J.S. Role of the endocytic machinery in the sorting of lysosome-associated membrane proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4231-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that SLC7A14 is truly a lysosomal resident. However, antibodies against SLC7A14 are necessary to examine the subcellular localization of the native protein in primary cells and tissues. In addition to its expression in human skin fibroblasts, high levels of SLC7A14 mRNA were detected in the CNS (brain, cerebellum, and spinal cord) using a human multi-tissue RNA panel (supplemental Fig. 4A). This is consistent with findings in other bilateral species (18Sreedharan S. Stephansson O. Schiöth H.B. Fredriksson R. Long evolutionary conservation and considerable tissue specificity of several atypical solute carrier transporters.Gene. 2011; 478: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Marginal mRNA levels could be detected in trachea, kidney, prostate, salivary gland, testis, and whole skin, whereas no SLC7A14 mRNA was detected in heart, fetal liver, placenta, thymus, and thyroid gland. Among various human cell lines tested, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and NB-OK-1 and TGW-1 neuroblastoma cells exhibited considerable SLC7A14 expression (supplemental Fig. 4B). SLC7A14 thus seems to be expressed primarily in skin fibroblasts, neuronal cells, and primary endothelial cells. If SLC7A14 indeed represents system c in these cells, a different transporter has to mediate lysosomal transport of cationic amino acids in tissues lacking SLC7A14 expression. Our mRNA analyses showed that hCAT-1 and SLC7A14 are the only members of the hCAT subfamily that are expressed at an appreciable level in human skin fibroblasts. As Pisoni et al. (1Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. Christensen H.N. Detection and characterization of carrier-mediated cationic amino acid transport in lysosomes of normal and cystinotic human fibroblasts. Role in therapeutic cystine removal?.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4791-4798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. Lemons R.M. Christensen H.N. Important differences in cationic amino acid transport by lysosomal system c and system y+ of the human fibroblast.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15011-15018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found clear differences in the transport activities of systems c and y+ (hCAT-1), it seems unlikely that hCAT-1 is responsible for the system c activity described in fibroblast lysosomes. On the other hand, the chimera carrying the functional domain of SLC7A14 had transport properties very similar to system c (and different from system y+/hCAT-1): apparent low substrate affinity, pH dependence, moderate trans-stimulation, and inhibition by ϵ-trimethyl-l-lysine. A crucial question is thus if the transport properties of the chimera reflect those of SLC7A14. Several findings indicate that this is indeed the fact. (i) The observation that the chimera mediated arginine transport suggests that its functional domain is derived from a transporter that recognizes this amino acid as substrate. In addition, the cationic amino acid lysine was recognized by the chimeric protein equally well as arginine (supplemental Fig. 5). (ii) Our previous work has shown that the functional domain defines the apparent substrate affinity and sensitivity to trans-stimulation (12Habermeier A. Wolf S. Martiné U. Gräf P. Closs E.I. Two amino acid residues determine the low substrate affinity of human cationic amino acid transporter 2A.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19492-19499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we have further shown that the pH dependence of the transport activity is also determined by this domain. Like the donor of the functional domain in the chimera hCAT-2/1_BK (hCAT-1), the chimera itself was pH-independent. As the chimera hCAT-2/A14_BK was pH-dependent, it seems very likely that the donor of its functional domain, SLC7A14, is a pH-dependent transporter as described for system c. (iii) In contrast to hCAT-1, the chimera hCAT-1/2A_BK recognized histidine very poorly, demonstrating that the functional domain is necessary for substrate recognition. However, other protein regions seem also to be involved in this process, as the introduction of the functional domain of hCAT-1 into the hCAT-2 backbone was not sufficient to fully confer histidine recognition. However, the importance of the functional domain in substrate recognition, together with the observed arginine transport activity for hCAT-2/A14_BK, strongly suggests that SLC7A14 is also an arginine transporter. In addition, this indicates that α-trimethyl-l-lysine is most likely recognized by SLC7A14. (iv) The transport properties of hCAT-2/A14_BK were similar but not identical to those of hCAT-2A. The chimera exported a 2-fold higher amount of arginine into buffer containing 1 mm arginine than into buffer without any cationic amino acid, whereas hCAT-2A was not trans-stimulated. Therefore, hCAT-2/A14_BK is clearly different from its backbone donor, hCAT-2A, and also from the system y+ transporter hCAT-1, which exhibited a more pronounced (7.6-fold) trans-stimulation than the chimera. The trans-stimulation of the chimera in fact resembles system c-mediated lysine efflux from lysosomes, which is 2-fold higher into lysine-containing buffer compared with buffer without amino acids (1Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. Christensen H.N. Detection and characterization of carrier-mediated cationic amino acid transport in lysosomes of normal and cystinotic human fibroblasts. Role in therapeutic cystine removal?.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4791-4798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that the system c-like transport properties of the chimera hCAT-2/A14_BK reflect the transport properties of SLC7A14. The “wrong” pH dependence of system c has already been discussed by Pisoni et al. (2Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. Lemons R.M. Christensen H.N. Important differences in cationic amino acid transport by lysosomal system c and system y+ of the human fibroblast.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15011-15018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For a lysosomal exporter, one would rather expect that the transport activity increases at low luminal pH (which is equivalent to extracellular pH in our transport assay). Instead, the activities of system c and the functional domain of SLC7A14 decrease at low pH, suggesting that they mediate substrate uptake into rather than efflux out of lysosomes. In our experiments, we varied only the pH at the extracellular space that corresponds to the intralysosomal space when considering the orientation of the transporter. In contrast, measuring uptake in isolated lysosomes, Pisoni et al. varied the pH at the extralysosomal side (corresponding to the cytoplasmic side). Efflux out of oocytes (corresponding to uptake into lysosomes) was just as poor at low pH as influx into oocytes (corresponding to export out of lysosomes). In addition, the pH dependence was identical under trans-stimulated and non-trans-stimulated conditions (data not shown). This indicates that, in general, SLC7A14 has only weak transport activity at low pH. hCAT-2/A14_BK showed an apparent low substrate affinity, similar to the low affinity of hCAT-2A and significantly different from the high affinity of hCAT-1. In comparison with system y+, low substrate affinity has also been described by Pisoni et al. (2Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. Lemons R.M. Christensen H.N. Important differences in cationic amino acid transport by lysosomal system c and system y+ of the human fibroblast.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15011-15018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for system c. Until now, it was not clear whether the functional domain also determines pH dependence. The pH independence of hCAT-2/1 (a chimeric protein with the functional domain of pH-independent hCAT-1 in the backbone of pH-dependent hCAT-2) supports this notion. It seems thus likely that the pH-dependent arginine transport of the hCAT-2/A14 chimera is a genuine characteristic of SLC7A14. In summary, the data presented here suggest that SLC7A14 may represent a lysosomal transporter for cationic amino acids resembling system c because (i) it localizes almost exclusively to lysosomes in mammalian cells; (ii) it is expressed in human skin fibroblasts, in which system c was first described; and most important, (iii) its functional domain confers arginine transport activity similar to system c. However, final proof has to await establishment of an assay in which transport of the native protein can be measured directly. In addition, other lysosomal transporters for cationic amino acids must exist in cells not expressing SLC7A14. Download .pdf (.71 MB) Help with pdf files"

By contrast, no information is available for their CoA-dependent counterparts. We present here the first crystal structure of a CoA-dependent ALDH. The structure of the methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MSDH) from Bacillus subtilis in binary complex with NAD+ shows that, in contrast to what is observed for hydrolytic ALDHs, the nicotinamide ring is well defined in the electron density due to direct and H2O-mediated hydrogen bonds with the carboxamide. The structure also reveals that a conformational isomerization of the NMNH is possible in MSDH, as shown for hydrolytic ALDHs. Finally, the adenine ring is substantially more solvent-exposed, a result that could be explained by the presence of a Val residue at position 229 in helix αF that reduces the depth of the binding pocket and the absence of Gly-225 at the N-terminal end of helix αF. Substitution of glycine for Val-229 and/or insertion of a glycine residue at position 225 resulted in a significant decrease of the rate constant associated with the dissociation of NADH from the NADH/thioacylenzyme complex, thus demonstrating that the weaker stabilization of the adenine ring is a key factor in triggering the early NADH release in the MSDH-catalyzed reaction.

Among the many enzymes that metabolize aldehydes, the members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 4The abbreviations used are: ALDHaldehyde dehydrogenaseALDH2class 2 ALDHMMSAmethylmalonate semialdehydeMSDHmethylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenaseRALDH2retinal dehydrogenase 2. superfamily play a critical role in protecting cells against the cytotoxic and carcinogenic effects of aldehydic compounds. In humans, the clinical importance of ALDHs is supported by the fact that mutations and polymorphisms in ALDH genes that lead to defective aldehyde metabolism are the molecular basis of severe diseases (1Marchitti S.A.

The ALDHs catalyze the NAD(P)+-dependent oxidation of a wide variety of aldehydes to their corresponding non-activated or CoA-activated acids via a common two-step chemical mechanism. The acylation step involves the formation of a hemithioacetal intermediate via the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic Cys-302 (the amino acid numbering used for the biochemical and structural data is that defined by Wang and Weiner (5Wang X.

This intermediate then undergoes a nucleophilic attack by an activated water or CoA molecule.

In addition to local conformational reorganizations of the active site induced by ligand binding that provide the required flexibility for an efficient catalysis (14Marchal S. Branlant G.

Chem. 2005; 280: 18590-18597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), one of the key aspects of the chemical mechanism of this ALDH family is the substantial conformational flexibility of the NMN moiety of the cofactor and in particular of the nicotinamide ring. 5The nicotinamide ring is well defined in the electron density maps in the crystal structures of η-crystallin (PDB code 1o9j) and ALDH1L1 (PDB code 2O2Q). However, η-crystallin is an inactive ALDH that acts as a UV/blue light filter in the lens, whereas in ALDH1L1 the stabilization of the nicotinamide ring is mainly achieved by formation of a covalent adduct between the C4 of the ring and the catalytic cysteine that is likely non-catalytically relevant. Indeed, the presence of multiple conformations of the NMN moiety is supported by the majority of the x-ray structures of ALDH-NAD(P)+ binary complexes as well as NMR studies and has been hypothesized to be due to the peculiar binding mode of the cofactor to a non-canonical Rossmann fold (9Liu Z.J.

Furthermore, significant efforts have been made to characterize the mode by which the cofactor is stabilized during both the acylation and the deacylation steps. In the acylation step, the NMN moiety must be positioned such that an efficient and stereospecific hydride transfer can occur from the hemithioacetal intermediate to the C-4 of the nicotinamide. The side chain of invariant Glu-399 was shown to play an essential role in this stabilization by anchoring the NMN ribose through hydrogen bonds with its hydroxyl groups (19Ni L. Sheikh S. Weiner H. Involvement of glutamate 399 and lysine 192 in the mechanism of human liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18823-18826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies support a critical contribution of the β-methyl group of the invariant Thr-244 residue that allows the nicotinamide ring to adopt a productive conformation for hydride transfer (20Pailot A. D'Ambrosio K. Corbier C. Talfournier F. Branlant G.

J. 2006; 400: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this conformation is not suitable for the deacylation because it would sterically preclude the catalytic Glu-268 from playing its role in the hydrolytic process. The fact that the cofactor remains bound to the enzyme along the two-step catalytic mechanism strongly suggested that movement of the reduced NMN (NMNH) moiety of the NAD(P)H is a prerequisite for completion of the second half of the reaction (21Perez-Miller S.J. Hurley T.D. Coenzyme isomerization is integral to catalysis in aldehyde dehydrogenase.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed, the first structural evidence for this conformational change of the NMNH during the catalytic cycle of hydrolytic ALDHs was provided by the crystal structure of a thioacylenzyme intermediate-NADPH complex (7D'Ambrosio K.

Specifically, this structure revealed that once the acylation step has occurred, the reduced cofactor adopts a new conformation with a flip of the NMNH moiety, which positions the reduced nicotinamide in a conserved cavity that might constitute the exit door for NAD(P)H. By contrast, less information is available concerning structural and/or mechanistic aspects of the CoA-dependent ALDHs. In an effort to address this gap in knowledge, our group has for several years been studying the catalytic mechanism of the methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MSDH) from Bacillus subtilis (22Stines-Chaumeil C.

This homotetrameric enzyme catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of methylmalonate semialdehyde (MMSA) and malonate semialdehyde to propionyl- and acetyl-CoA, respectively, and has been reported to be involved in myo-inositol catabolism (24Yoshida K.I. Aoyama D. Ishio I. Shibayama T. Fujita Y. Organization and transcription of the myo-inositol operon, iol, of Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, MSDH is a mitochondrial enzyme that participates in the distal portions of the valine and pyrimidine catabolic pathways (25Goodwin G.W. Rougraff P.M. Davis E.J. Harris R.A. Purification and characterization of methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase from rat liver. Identity to malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14965-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible correlation between organic acidemia and MSDH deficiency has been explored (26Chambliss K.L. Gray R.G. Rylance G. Pollitt R.J. Gibson K.M. Molecular characterization of methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Gray R.G. Pollitt R.J. Webley J. Methylmalonic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. Demonstration of defective valine and β-alanine metabolism and reduced malonic semialdehyde dehydrogenase activity in cultured fibroblasts.Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1987; 38: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and very recently, Sass et al. (28Sass J.O. Walter M. Shield J.P. Atherton A.M. Garg U. Scott D. Woods C.G. Smith L.D. 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate aciduria and mutations in the ALDH6A1 gene coding for methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2012; 35: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) proposed that polymorphism in the human ALDH6A1 gene encoding MSDH is directly correlated with 3-hydroxybutyric aciduria, a severe metabolic disease. Detailed kinetic studies of the MSDH-catalyzed reaction have shown that (i) the rate constant associated with the acylation step is high (kac > 1000 s−1), indicating that the position of the nicotinamide ring relative to the hemithioacetal allows efficient hydride transfer, and (ii) that NADH release occurs before the rate-limiting β-decarboxylation and CoA attack on the thioacylenzyme intermediate (22Stines-Chaumeil C. Talfournier F. Branlant G. Mechanistic characterization of the MSDH (methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) from Bacillus subtilis.Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), thus supporting the ping-pong kinetic mechanism that has previously been reported for other CoA-dependent ALDHs (29Shone C.C. Fromm H.J. Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics of coenzyme A linked aldehyde dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7494-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Söhling B. Gottschalk G. Purification and characterization of a coenzyme A-dependent succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Clostridium kluyveri.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Taken together these data raise important questions regarding the evolution of the catalytic mechanism within the ALDH superfamily. In particular, it is of interest to determine whether the pattern of interactions that is thought to stabilize an efficient hydride transfer conformation of the NMN moiety of the cofactor in the hydrolytic ALDHs is also operative in the members of the CoA-dependent family. Additionally, two key aspects related to the structural dynamics associated with the release of the reduced cofactor remain to be addressed, (i) whether cofactor isomerization after hydride transfer occurs in CoA-dependent ALDHs and ii) the molecular and structural factors responsible for the early or late release of the reduced cofactor occurring in the catalytic cycle of CoA-dependent and hydrolytic ALDHs, respectively. We detail here the first crystal structure of a CoA-dependent ALDH. The structure of the binary MSDH/NAD+ complex shows that, in contrast to what is observed in nearly all x-ray structures of hydrolytic ALDH-NAD(P)+ binary complexes, the nicotinamide ring is well defined in the electron density due to direct and H2O-mediated hydrogen bonds between the amino group of the carboxamide and residues belonging to the cofactor binding and the catalytic domains. Moreover, the pocket that is postulated to constitute the exit door of the reduced cofactor in the hydrolytic ALDHs is conserved, thus suggesting that a cofactor isomerization also occurs in MSDH and the entire CoA-dependent ALDH family. Finally, superimposition of all ALDH holo-structures reveals that the adenine ring of NAD+ is substantially more solvent-exposed in MSDH. Analysis of the adenine binding pocket highlights several structural factors that could explain this marked difference; (i) the presence of a Val residue at position 229 in the MSDH that reduces the depth of the binding pocket, thereby increasing the solvent exposure of the adenine ring, and (ii) the absence of Gly-225 at the N-terminal end of helix αF. These observations suggest a major role for the adenine binding mode in the dynamics of the reduced cofactor in the MSDH catalytic mechanism. Indeed, substitution of glycine for Val-229 and/or insertion of a glycine residue at position 225 in the MSDH from B. subtilis resulted in a significant decrease of the rate constant associated with the dissociation of NADH from the NADH/thioacylenzyme complex, thus validating this assumption. NAD+ was purchased from Roche Applied Science. CoA, pyruvate, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were from Sigma. MMSA was synthesized as described by Kupiecki and Coon (31Kupiecki F.P. Coon M.J. Methylmalonic semialdehyde.Biochem. Prep. 1960; 7: 69-71Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined by titration with MSDH. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using standard PCR site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type and mutated MSDHs were produced and purified using a procedure described previously (22Stines-Chaumeil C. Talfournier F. Branlant G. Mechanistic characterization of the MSDH (methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) from Bacillus subtilis.Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by using molar absorption coefficients of 2.04 × 105 m−1·cm−1 at 280 nm for wild-type and mutated MSDHs. In the present paper, enzyme concentrations are expressed per monomer (normality, n). Initial rate measurements were carried out at 30 °C on a SAFAS UV mc2 spectrophotometer by following the appearance of NADH at 340 nm in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.2). Before kinetic measurements in the presence of MMSA, wild-type and mutated MSDHs were preincubated at 30 °C with 2 mm NAD+ to activate the enzyme and eliminate the lag-phase exhibited by progress curves for enzymatic turnover (22Stines-Chaumeil C. Talfournier F. Branlant G. Mechanistic characterization of the MSDH (methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) from Bacillus subtilis.Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The initial rate data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear least-squares regression analysis to determine the kcat and Km values. All Km values were determined at saturating concentrations of the other substrates. Pre-steady-state kinetic analyses were carried out on a SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus (Applied PhotoPhysics), and collected data were analyzed using the SX18MV-R software package. To study the acylation step, progress curves of NADH production were recorded at 340 nm and at 30 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.2) in the absence of CoA. One syringe was filled with 32 μn MSDH and 2 mm NAD+, and the other contained 2 mm MMSA. To evaluate the rate of NADH dissociation from the thioacylenzyme-NADH complex, the coupled pyruvate/lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was used as an NADH trapping system. One syringe was filled with 32 μn MSDH and 2 mm NAD+, and the other contained 1 mm MMSA, 32 μn LDH, and 20 mm pyruvate. Experiments were carried out in the absence of CoA in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.2) at 30 °C. Data were fit to a biphasic expression. Orthorhombic crystals of the MSDH from B. subtilis were obtained from a concentrated protein solution (200 mg/ml) and in the presence of 10 mm NAD+. Ammonium sulfate was used as precipitant agent. Detailed protocols for MSDH expression, purification, crystallization, and preliminary x-ray analysis were reported previously (32Dubourg H. Stines-Chaumeil C. Didierjean C. Talfournier F. Rahuel-Clermont S. Branlant G. Aubry A. Expression, purification, crystallization, and preliminary X-ray diffraction data of methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1435-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The structure of the MSDH from B. subtilis was solved by molecular replacement, revealing that MSDH crystallizes with one homotetramer per asymmetric unit like the cod liver betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase used as a search model (18Johansson K. El-Ahmad M. Ramaswamy S. Hjelmqvist L. Jörnvall H. Eklund H. Structure of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase at 2.1 Å resolution.Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2106-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (PDB entry 1bpw). The structure was initially refined using rigid body minimization and simulated annealing procedures before iterative cycles of manual rebuilding and refinement. Using 20–2.5 Å data, the final Rfree and Rcryst values were 0.25 and 0.211, respectively. The asymmetric unit consisted of 4 polypeptide chains (in all monomers, residues Glu-3–Phe-486), 4 NAD+ molecules, and 866 water molecules. The first two residues and the last residue were not found in electron density maps and so are presumably disordered. The MSDH structure exhibited good geometry, with 89.9% of all residues in the most favored and 9.3% in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot as indicated by the program Procheck (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. PROCHECK: a program to check the stereochemical quality of protein structures.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Molecular replacement calculations and structure refinement were carried out using the CNS program package (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). The graphics programs Turbofrodo (35Roussel P.A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO, Silicon Graphics Applications Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) and PyMOL were used in model building and in preparation of figures, respectively. Further statistics are summarized in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab As expected, the three-dimensional structure of the MSDH from B. subtilis conforms to known tetrameric ALDH structures; the tetramer of the enzyme is a dimer of dimers with strong interactions at the dimer interface but weaker interactions at the tetramer interface (11Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. The genetic component of ethanol aversion.Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and the monomer consists of three domains, the dinucleotide binding domain (residues 3–123 and 141–251), the catalytic domain (residues 252–270), and a small domain (residues 124–140 and 471–486) involved in the oligomerization (Fig. 1). A structural comparison with available entries in the Protein Data Bank database was performed using the PDBeFold server (36Krissinel E. Henrick K. Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviations upon comparing the Cα traces of all available monomer structures vary from 1.4 to 2.5 Å, the most similar and distant structures being that of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PDB code 2wme (37González-Segura L. Rudiño-Piñera E. Muñoz-Clares R.A. Horjales E. The crystal structure of a ternary complex of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa provides new insight into the reaction mechanism and shows a novel binding mode of the 2‘-phosphate of NADP+ and a novel cation binding site.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 385: 542-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) and that of dimeric ALDH3 (PDB code 1ad3 (9Liu Z.J. Sun Y.J. Rose J. Chung Y.J. Hsiao C.D. Chang W.R. Kuo I. Perozich J.

Biol. 1997; 4: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar)). The crystal structure of the MSDH from B. subtilis did not reveal significant structural differences between the four monomers within each asymmetric unit. Indeed, the average root mean square deviation value obtained from the different pairwise superimpositions of the Cα atoms was 0.23 Å, and the monomers exhibited similar average isotropic displacement parameters. Each monomer is occupied by a NAD+ molecule that is well defined in the final 2|Fo| − |Fc| elect"
